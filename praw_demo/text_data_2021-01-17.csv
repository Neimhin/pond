0,2021-01-17,"  There's really proof videos covid caused think many fake highly exaggerated. perhaps someone fainted, didnt drop dead, etc. Ive never seen one thats verified person dying covid. good question know mean seem portrayed deadly wuhan. Idk. Canada USA people protesting even front hospitals saying masks violation human rights aashat freedoms.

One group even protested right front COVID-19 ward hospital. SMH

You hear much us Canadians sometimes bad Americans. Except part public health benefit minimize deaths serious illness. thirty year old trust fund baby comorbidities, preconditions essential work (first responder, etc) gets shot ahead everyone else, someone else may die. increase numbers gets certain. mention fact maybe need stop internalizing insane idea vital health care go rich others. Whenever hear something like it’s always poorly thought out.

The day it’s offered everyone?

It needs enough time people get two shots two weeks second shot.

Memorial Day absurdly optimistic. would require everyone access shots early April Eating indoors... illegal parties. giant superspreader riot DC... Well then. guess 60% Americans can't handle flu them. Maybe tried eat organic fresh food. eat raw fresh organic food essential oils I'm fine.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* take 9 months make baby? Shit fucking hard man regular fridge months time wasted precious time complain someone liking mask Yes! Get Trump stinkiness house. go outside could stand loose eye 2 guess. response regarding Oregon, right?

Thought so.  floated 10k runnoffs. 

And last sentence appears may misinformed countries aide packages. replaced wages (or portion wages) jobless. country actually implemented UBI. example, Canada’s 2k CAD month 4 months actually lot less generous $600/wk unemployment boost. 

I’m demanding/calling more. think characterizing student loans walkback wrong, checks it’s complicated. exactly. It’s small risk, worth reward? don’t think so. 

I wonder though people hyper aware health now, especially post-covid diagnosis/recovery, notice health irregularities would have. 

Like, don’t doubt covid exacerbated people’s health issues, would someone normally brush “rough days” sluggish would go see doctor even covid never thing. Honestly taste going away serious enough consequence stopped going out. hate can’t taste things cold, lasts day. I’d go mind lasted month. 

Thats even mentioning young people i’ve seen blood clots go blood thinners notice. something inherent mRNA vaccines deem shorter vaccine trials sufficient? Wish could trade governments England bit...just bit Flounce, flaunt. Sweden, example, nursing home workers paid terribly can't afford work - that's one reason Sweden many deaths. People went work sick.

That's horrible. heard many good things Sweden pandemic. told everyone gets benefits adequate compensation, even unskilled workers. assumed PSWs getting adequate pay sick leave, especially pandemic. guess not. vaccine primarily used England? way stop prison. Survive till get vaccine. hope so! LOL think I'm paranoid bad experiences past things stomped hard.  even regular pub goer fuck, want spend week one shoot shit mates One dream exorcism.  later revealed tested positive COVID-19 August 29, 2020, well suffering thrombosis, brain fog pneumonia.[51]   
  
Jesus fucking Christ.  
That makes feel slightly better hypochondriac germophobic paranoia. known issue vaccine before...? study mRNA works, alleviate fears (at least moderna pfizer). old administration probably still busy sticking boogers desks Yeah, death far reason worry Covid.  exactly happened me. dumbass roommate went night club got everyone house sick right Christmas. guess hes recently? fucking nightclub. We're texas fucking uncontrolled selfish assholes like reason shits still going not? there's lot warnings heeded, unfortunately ""mistakes made"". assuming media always, always, always right major disappointment.

I never said always right always be. said right time - deadly right. Nice! That's great right water weight, especially cut back carbs. Odds heavily family's favor covid. Try stress much keep close eye things. Hope sister well. take supplemental math class. Lol, that's good joke. pub. cannot fucking wait get pub. It’s even pint, bought something pour house. want see everyone chat shit like old days. miss people! Even old crowd table, can’t wait chat shit Yeah, Australia New Zealand two Western nations comes mind understand quick pain better prolong pain, course strong enforcement, implementation anti-virus measures mixed lockdown. agree. seriously screwed us over, hard even wrap head around badly failed. faster approve them, better. time conservative here, that's true entire pandemic. Maybe would help Thank God way taking chance.

Someone tell goes please. Cries Canadian. Anti-maskers, etc. might start running bit trouble. I'm wondering thing... going get lot harder control immunized folks still carry spread. 

Then question long term health issues. 

I'm getting super depressed vaccine cause nothing really change yet... know of.  teacher middle school. kids contracted covid, generally opt virtual trying come back able deal it. UK rollout managed NHS, one worlds largest government agencies, anthesis small government ? onsite every day work I’m diligently taking precautions

Good!

As /r/Masks4All regular somewhat mask geek, I'm curious sort masks tend use work. there's lot warnings heeded, unfortunately ""mistakes made"". assuming media always, always, always right major disappointment.

also, neglecting fact noted impossible right. i'll rephrase, anyone said ""the worst yet come"" 100% right aren't. 100% wrong long keep saying it. also, anyone said last february worst would march wrong, anyone last march said worst would april wrong, etc etc etc Lets get excited vaccines then. Oh boy russia one. China two. barely adequate sold. intent vaccine countries Africa infrastructure refrigerated vaccine storage. Africa surprisingly easy go things. dont think vaccine much game changer. Pfizer Moderna at, Moderna better lipid encapsulation.  think part issue it’s approved emergency use. fda hasn’t given full approval yet ingredients, I'll double check. normal ppl figuring way around disease though. double blind, placebo controlled study hundreds millions, billions dollars invested R&amp;D. assure long-haulers slipped cracks. injected 30-40k ppl one test group severe disease. single one, either Moderna Pfizer study. really afraid 1 40k? 

When turn up, take it. turn came today. There's really whole lot second guess. wish media talked more, vaccines extraordinarily effective. could dreamed they'd end effective, least regards mRNA vaccines Like Dominic Raab saying might go back tiered system March. guarantee, light end tunnel rather nice...(heres hoping bloody freight train!) Thank you! I've eating healthy calorie range! 360lb, bit waterweight lose, probably? lost 12 pounds two weeks ago 3 week. Well really hope ends okay. mean heart problems scary. America gets daily. Ok, population difference.

Do think they're learning anything it? 
**or health destroyed it** Warp Speed likely stock manipulation scheme, right? blunt that? r/NoShitSherlock apologies delete. Sounds like bit mess. You’ll people following get second shot, others try luck getting ten shots year “extra protection”.  74 million / 328 Million = 23% quick mafs largely Southern states people congregate inside escape heat. moderate weather regions infections plateaued summer thanks outdoor activity much safer. nearly 50 years public service

During time he's done precisely fuck besides oversee bunch foreign wars decimation US industry. medical errors contagious ****** ?  There'd 8, car broke whilst away.... monumentally bad hangovers. I’m gonna fuck around Covid find out.  already well 500k numbers 2020 still coming found out.   imagine lungs get squeezed chest muscles build, providing less capacity time...  thats lmiting factor survival... longas lung reserves arn't threatened ( hi bmi, damage ect) people okayish. U know bad u read comments redditors start speaking experience... papers ""just"" numbers way? talk ""freedom"" ""rights"" front pure total selfishness. don’t want people going hospitals get vaccine. hospitals already overwhelmed. need set temporary clinics places like Walmart means they're taking limited slots available elderly population Florida, no, great  still regularly hear Texans shrug covid deaths might ILLEGAL ALIENS “just” old people. Using label “nazi” hyperbolic ... whole lot people aren’t bothered needing freezer trucks, bodies, means don’t interrupt daily lives. Yeah, way pubs closed it. They'll plenty big screen gatherings even know nonce is? course personal issues problems 1.3 billion people .Meanwhile excuses others. 


You . finding excuses hate others . case terrain set people ...or senese taste ever again. get might enjoy eating pleasure again... I'm sure gonna repalce habits. keep wearing control, help us get back normal faster.  mean, claim medical conditions want... verifying *any* them.  two weeks since March.

Now Biden calling 100 days.

If go math, maybe finally let end sometime 2026. going get orange furniture? Yeah. issue we've essentially spent money figuring out, even though valuable piece information could judging whether let everyone 60 get infected. research done basically unfunded, looking trivially tiny sample sizes subsets infected population. difficult guess full picture resulting data.

20% NYC caught COVID spring. done large-scale survey 100,000 random New Yorkers, full serological physical workup, followups time. would cheap, resulting information would far value.

The situation we're going vaccinate enough people drop IFR 75% next month so. then? Back business usual mean everyone else catch spring. Preventing everyone catching spring, B.1.1.7 strain likely making things much difficult, could overwhelmingly high cost. there's simply data available rationally make choice. Yeah I’ll tip hat them. I’ve Amazon’s private delivery stuff screw times, completely fail leave package right spot. Anything complex single family home seems confound drivers. 

Meanwhile dabbawalas navigate absolute labyrinth city drop food issues. think finding addresses tough time time? world it’s way worse. lot “go road X kilometers, turn left, look pink door” “1234 Somesuch Road, Apartment 3” would preferred part EU scheme? would take death veretable crippled... really want know going around 2019 NYE everyone know sicker ever, COVID symptoms. JNJ’s viral vector uses prefusion stabilized spike opposed wild type used AZN. JNJ’s vector theoretically stable could well effective. still wish national guard would come force people stay doors 2-3 weeks. Come outside? Get shot.

The american people fucking stupid handle like actual adults, brute force comes handy. never symptoms outcomes matter

What suppose ""ground glass opacities CT scans"" means? Hint: opposite debunked. could provide dozen links high quality reports along similar lines, also find yourself, given apparent minimization issue, think should. Heh. nigh anniversary China announcing world.

Time f... 

What year :/ well oxygen deprivation would hurt protein muscles harder fat... cause o2 requirements higher em guess...

decreased lung function covid would reduce o2 guess. COVID May still experiencing taste smell distortions. toothpaste tastes like mildew, dairy chocolate weird chemical taste... want enjoy slice pizza again! driving crazy!! goal posts already moved. unless new administration scores 121 yard touchdown pass considered failure y’all downvoting I’m upset got 600k today yesterday. love progress going 1.1 million day little half 3/7 days week really disheartening... convince us population oil blood vaccine bring democracy. Thank you. Jesus christ really hope do. They’re smart use USPS I'm nursing student right now. Already bracing seeing non-stop brain damage organ damage complications rest career. know 4 people COVID. 1 dead, 3 long-haulers one respect another (primarily short-term memory loss lung problems).

As healthcare system miserable enough groaning weight skyrocketing obesity diabetes cases, complications come them, varying degrees lung brain damage getting added pile? going rough decade (not even taking account air water pollution causing additional damage cascading climate crisis going on).  I’m shocked! Shocked! i'm hoping slightly less effective. know makes sense let's say 99% effective, everyone already got pfizer moderna likely skip second dose move straight j&amp;j line set everyone back slightly less effective everyone stages 1a, 1b, 1c whatever stay line finish 2 dose courses basically healthy get vaccine slightly less effective. sometime next year get jabbed best one want go route. ironic mention ordering vaccines, that's exactly Germany started doing! They've begun ordering outside EU supply deal - actually fucks smaller, poorer EU nations relying deal.

Also, German population 83m vs 68m UK. major difference. UK tiny like Israel UAE.

Oxford vaccine actually made Netherlands Germany - research done UK. Plan supply chain soon making UK.

The UK's advantages result evil right wing scheme. crank say UK really well - EU badly. (rightly) willing pay get supply quicker, quicker regulatory approval process we've got really good process delivery going on.

It's rare British success story! read West Virginia leading states vaccinations! social darwinism..... bro edition. I've seen experts say mutation different one B117's. I'm mid 30s, never smoked, exercise, healthy af.

Covid fucking bomb life. 10 months I'm still weird. Sure believe people making vaccine rna type vaccines probably best estimates long last. 

Regardless saying get once.  exactly looking it, kinda sticks out. people wearing them, going stick even more. understand vaccine available average people close, gets here, everyone still whether they're tired not. makes say J&amp;J could 80%? tested positive April , mildly sick 5 days bad side effects since then. 

The headline says ""Many patients"" , ""many"" could mean anything . 1 10,000? 100,000? fake news maybe, sensational news.

IMO **death natural causes** results illness internal malfunction body directly caused external forces, infectious disease.   **unnatural death** results external cause, typically including homicides, suicides, accidents, medical errors, drug overdoses. 

Infectious diseases specifically included ""natural causes"". Unless think someone intentionally infected something like that. got hung price paid per dose manufacturer forgot logistics carry real costs too. need maybe $100 per dose cover admin tasks. clinical trial results. wish way downvote cancer. knows. hope recover 1000%! people depend insurance covers. yet everyone still walking around acting normal, claiming it’s flu. :/ $200k fucking toilet cleaning? Well, guess $70k hair stylist justified now. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Apple Watch? I’d curious quantifiable measurements. Like noticed vo2 max, average heart rate anything lot research completed post Covid health, take time complete publish. Also challenges first priority treatment issues found lots different manifestations long term issues. issues kind things would expect someone post viral, issues could symptoms existed precovid patient really paid much attention to. want get lesser effective vaccine I'm thrilled countries getting it'll help curve pandemic ultimately reduce chances catching covid. afraid vaccines distrusting government equally insane viewpoints. Tuskeege, nuclear testing, syphillis experiment. act like done shit people. 18000? Cannot compete US! Winning.

Excuse cry sleep. forget key principle medicine. never symptoms outcomes matter. plenty diseases, actions, forth produce damage lungs. mean lungs permanently damaged even affect patient way. 


I'm also going say largely debunked shown nearly much concern might think would be. What's Thursday? Thought said release data couple weeks  family first ones get COVID country March go New York family members surgery. mild symptoms got quickly, almost year later mild cough(severe sometimes days calms down) constant tickle throat won’t go away, I’ve many doctors done many tests, persist. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* almost vaccinating healthy people invisible virus wouldnt know exists wasnt teli sucks man, i'm sick fucking virus. Hope stays healthy. Bad idea. vaccines EUA. FDA approved, mandating right worms want fuck with. mild flu won’t tell it’s still going long receive shots. get appointment earlier. honest, Brazil’s problem vaccine isn’t money. We’ve sitting millions Coronavac vaccines weeks waiting approval.

We also partnership fiocruz Oxford sinovac Butantã local manufacturing two vaccines, I’m sure hasn’t started yet.

And lastly, president didn’t help. Apparently pfizer offered doses government declined offer reason. also months political battle Joao Doria (São Paulo’s governor) Coronavac vaccine. worry, years ago! That's joke Yes. it’s barrier “normal” 
If think people hesitant wait start offering 5 year olds mandating quickly. I’m 37. every plan get shot. two kids 10. get vaccines.  I’m itching get vaccinated though. Kids different adults studied kids months. let’s wait see attitude intense. quite studies articles long-term effects, think hundreds people going walk away long-term damage, you’re sorely Covid? countries going face problem world starts open again, unless countries get almost full vaccination, see spike, US likely large percentage people choosing getting vaccinated covid already(due anti vaxxers likely follow safety measures), boost immunity levels. Australia, NZ get like 70-80% vaccinated, virus going spread. Oh, fuck it. I'll proud pissed sub off, lol! biggie! Wish see phone bed. I'll days end worrying.

I think covid 2 3 months ago literally symptoms 3 4 days max. 

I live aunt feeling well literally day. went got tested came back positive assumed toughed house quarantined 2 weeks.

She said feel bad. felt like typical cold. fine within 3 4 days tops. lose smell anything.

For me, bones legs aching real bad first day felt like small sore throat coming sucked cough drops. also felt like typical cold fine 2 3 days symptoms. Oh, would get hot cold suddenly couple days. Also ended losing taste smell couple weeks that's happened. legs also aching first day symptoms.

I'm almost mid 30s greatest health. used drink energy drink two week I've money them. Sometimes drink several energy drinks week though extra cash. get outside much (haven't job since pandemic hit hit stopped looking one) obese definitely fit. 6 ft tall. helps anyone.

We careful always wore masks sanitized go out. aunt watches kids week home living there's that. parents go actual work places. everyone choice able stay locked doors months end human contact. 

Oh grandmother living us past couple years cancer decided come back year take hospital times. end died internal bleeding due stint rupturing.

Idk I'm even writing this. Guess I'm worrying I'm going develop heart problems. also people need stop blame game. We're humans. know people going dealing with. can't stay locked inside til gets figured out. People wear masks everywhere everything right still get spread it. is. sucks. try nice people. try safe. We're together. people go overboard. 

The number times hear people say want politicians force approval AZ vaccine screaming one listening scientists mind bending me. Dude, next 3.5 years, complaint be, “we still recovering racist, bigoted, evil president we’ve ever had! Vote us another 4 us continue “fixing” “destroyed”. 

Just saying. agree. think australia nz still trying quell outbreaks long rest world moved on. idea many people lauding approach best. bound fail eventually, done delay inevitible think every state yet peak. deaths come six weeks initial infection, still weeks seeing real damage Christmas New Years celebrations.  generous there.

We basically messed near enough everything except this. Saying ""some"" really undersells disaster dumbasses handled this. set free 14 days. close contact people since infected anyone. course covid symptoms anymore. antibiotic surgery. sure exactly which. Let tell you, loss smell taste weirdest thing I’ve ever experienced. really hope isn’t anything crazy wrong body future virus. care anyone says Heinz 57 shit. MEDICATION Define ""many"".

Let guess, rare.   US, bad advice. 1) Mortgage rates super low right now, 2) try time market. Fox news, maybe largest single ""news"" outlet viewership (during past year), *regularly* put hosts camera dismissed covid -- *even* election. probably *still* find dismissing covid (I watch channel, track closely)

And merely referring covid, go several comments up, specifically talking long lasting effects covid people recover, including people demographics ""supposed"" suffer much risk covid -- which, re-read thread title, main topic entire post. Think billions made. I've ER several times past years types symptoms, that's pandemic (I dared go since pandemic started, also really anything palpitations sometimes year).

Two triggers seem either shortly large meal (hence probably heartburn), driving, suspect let curl upper body forward much times, bending forward tends trigger palpitations.

I've always told E.R., EKG, blood tests verify heart attack blood clots, chest X-rays, either heartburn/GERD, something musculoskeletal anxiety time.

My heartburn mostly nonexistent year, might part it. Crazy apparently heartburn cause chest pain, numbness left arm, light-headedness, heart racing, almost violent palpitations (worse ones get periodically, almost feels like I'm getting punched), etc.

I'm going idea actually get heart attack, then, can't afford go ER every single time happens me.

So guess check tend heartburn issues, change diet reduce that, and/or exercise might help.

It sucks, scary, I'm sorry going it. hope find root cause issue is. find out, let know well! antibodies vaccine Thanks playing folks, see next week” 🥺 Imagine political orgy would happen 100 days Biden fact say take masks. He's fat!! California friends (unvaccinated) traveling Hawaii like Pandemic smh.  Maybe governor spent time planning solution color coding maps ignored mostly everywhere would better off. But,But..... 1% mortality rate! Flu! bad!!!!! /s best relax can. Anxiety help anything.

Turn news off, get subreddit best rest Someone work gave mother-in-law, lives wife gave us. quarantining since April last year treating seriously. symptoms, thankfully, mild like cold far hopefully get worse. mRNA brand new. They’re shooting quantity possibly sacrificing little quality. Anything 75 one shot absolute home run.  establish faith populace vaccines work/are safe. still disturbing number people concerned testing reactions, due hype media. Make wonder we’ll able anything normal 2022 then. Yeah, comment removed mean repost it.   Lets say nba. articles see say ""tested positive covid 19"". Definitely dozens top tier KAT, Luka, harden... fair, Bartolo Colon MLB starting pitcher paragon athleticism. extra 10% movement speed help out. I'm Australia suspend gym membership latest outbreak ongoing. Thankfully ridiculous numbers anything like hoping week new cases happen soon get back again. friends son early 20s. got went brain. stutters can't remember anything. scary. hope gets better. happened supposed ventilator shortage?

Did car manufacturers end producing ventilators? FYI. depends state. state (NY), immuno-compromised people well serious co-morbidities yet eligible vaccinated. 

Speaking one people, let tell complete joy sit quarantine indefinitely read Facebook posts people younger healthier who've already vaccinated.  Normal people aren’t hawking cdc numbers every day. Plus 100 100 sounds cool. we’re triple it’ll like Democrats heroes. 
Politicians always politicians first. Agree, making political new thing. political 1918 political countries. cvs/walgreens vaccine roll federal program. Seeing state refused program #1 vaccine distribution % makes seem like flaw program whole.

That take away california’s issues vaccine roll out. 

Many things going start change wednesday. It’s absurd think case. Yep. told brother buy house next years prices might go WAY down. Right upgraded increase spread rate Hard agree! well helps, vast majority Americans started brain damaged much net change SARS immensely worse covid-19. political response made look feds look worse. 
Feds: Michigan isn’t using vaccines. We’re giving vaccines use them. 
Michigan: ummm we’re using them. Kinda. suck reporting it. 
Feds: sooo you’ve used shipped??
Michigan: ehhhh 
Only release chart showing general vaccine October. 
Remember governor Michigan close Biden. plainly politics meant make one side look like villain lob fat one plate side smack perceived home run. think I’ve developed tinnitus slight hearing loss it. back February. Audiologist confirmed hearing loss left ear.  article trash, lacks real information, get word MANY, statistics means, anecdotes. Look Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. lot “long covid” actually POTS. stay away take solace fact they're months away vaccination.  thing December 2019. covid/flu symptoms, traveling lot- could exposed either. 103 fever like four days couldn’t move exhausted. Shit awful. took work never didn’t recover 100% February. definitely normal symptom, shadowing ENT clinic 2020 lots patients who'd months coming worried smell distortion. Look Posture Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome! I'm sorry gor sick arrogant dumbasses like ability think things care effect actions others personally affects exact reason dire straits currently in. I've lost sympathy patience people like you, still hope get better honestly fault better someone supposed to. First ray hope long. like think would happen certain change taking place. what? absolutely zero new interesting information article. clickbait local news channel. COVID epidemic, therefore means cannot avoid esp airplanes, travels, etc. like cold, viruses, spread quickly worse thing can't see knowing whether not. would say vaccine probably solution right now, mutation already began, see deaths coming years. slow think similar previous epidemics either vaccine people get it, immune disease died rest survive. get one type vaccine (IE; Moderna Pfizer) increase likelyhood full immunity rather 90%? Damn, feel like people warned that. warning signs damage mentioned here? common enough though (vast majority reported), let guard down.

This make believe comment. could well right. might underestimating power modern science/biotech people even look it

it *put* front eyes, every channel medium available.

and lots major media united states that

so obtuse. I've lost lot strength too... covid able train heavy weights since March 2020 due closure gyms. miss heavy weights :( wish sub people like us symptoms still. Lettuce taste like mold me, Onions taste like female genitalia garlic smells like metal. Insulin $20.  You’re literally person thinking one dose shot anywhere around 75% isn’t game changer. brain. There’s data people previously mentally healthy developing psychoses like bipolar disorder schizophrenia. 

FWIW, Chris Cuomo CNN pretty open long hauler issues, including depression. 

Look photos year ago, now. looked like well dressed version Hulk. looks 10 years older 30 lbs lighter. makes sense. Thanks. Reports lasting clots limited lung function young people reported last months. It’s shame people willingly chose listen young people “will fine” kept putting others increased risk. 

I can’t speak rest world US people fucking awful deserve get. Yes get steroids including methylprednisolone packs took. Overall however dose packs pretty low dose. I'll give mg methylprednisolone single IV dose someone bad asthma attack contained entire medrol dose pak  ever find cause it? point long term effect Covid mutates vaccines longer work provide long term protection. many instances vaccines stopgap. part scared you?

This study, anecdotal clickbait local news station. absolutely new information, nothing children. Huh, basically exactly I'm experiencing... started symptoms around March... Echo/EKG/Stress tests normal, I've every lung test ever, CT scans everything neck, ton blood tests, I'm sure stuff I've forgotten, absolutely nothing ordinary, symptoms real explanation. article point talking trump community refusing wear masks? Jai-na going take large amount time 'variant' escape vaccines. happens, even variant anymore new corona virus strain, like covid 19. would create new pandemic. Maybe decades now.

The SARS 1 virus produced antibodies could bind Covid 19 new variant absolutely covered vaccines. Pfizer Moderna stop making vaccines tel anybody? approved they’re going scale production. Fast. may even see WWII type “cooperation” competitors start making formula. 
The problem 5 weeks going supply. Remember: China test 20 million people 3 days.

So get ass move heal motherfucking world read article.  

This study, anecdotal clickbait local news station. absolutely new information, nothing children. Nope. free. agencies may charge minimal administrative fee covered pretty much ins. Co. working mom full distance learning honestly say keep wondering nix elementary even middle school year give kids assessment place properly next year. Distance learning taking toll full time job full time kids. even story I've sub long enough looked like actual sarcastic comment I'd typically see, ha. time. pneumonia early 2020 testing COVID thing, strongly believe COVID. lost sense taste then, bizarre sensation. ate lot spicy food could feel heat, couldnt taste spice flavor. think articles designed piss unfortunately inform you.

Welcome modern journalism. thinking 1-2 yrs 12 yrs regular school education....
the younger kids wont able deal experience, believe older kids wont big problem, since like need re-learn person classes like. Ontario lol. Doug Ford moron done opposite science said since beginning. hes mismanaged distribution vaccine we're full lockdown new page spammer. Nothing new uncertainty regarding impact vaccine. great cell reception boot!

(This joke) Well, fair, many people decided many months ago gave anything differently. see point, let’s give people decision making power. Bullshit, country Europe sits vaccine can't organize shit. (Not mentioned ordered less EU provided bother ordering anything else that.)  Yeah couple Manaus story mutations really takes wind sails probably roughly 75 million. add 50 million vaccinated total end January/early February.

How much overlap gotten Covid recovered getting vaccinated? bound overlap, I'm curious much might be. Thats take exams Japan.  Yes, proper homeschooling, parents involved. will, way. Personally make sure mask tight possible solves issue entirely me.

There alternatives (so I've heard) like rubbing bit dish soap glasses prevent fogging up. Could Vaccination cause problems like this? Since usually contain small sample virus.  

My wife teacher could get soon, trying make sure best decision get it. say 200k day? fast enough cause global pandemic. proposing 100 days masks complete 100 million shots 100 days, proposed type national lockdown. old people dying get vaccine. sorry lost father. Wow, that's care people cutting front elderly vulnerable. got yours, F huh. Guess what, got 2 doses vaccine already, still care vulnerable population. Hey Siri, look ""mask burning parties"" scheduled Memorial Day. agree this! Though I'm definitely dismissive original commenter's symptoms. There's still much know.

But personally vouch anxiety making entire body go haywire. worst letting run unchecked, developed unrelated condition unrelated condition. got control, symptoms slowly started disappear, never got again.

It's scary think Covid attacking many things once, consider good thing maybe, least things, isn't. Getting stress control so, hard, things much better now.  I’m pretty confident they’re trolling actually upvoted since sub care hysteria much trolls would like claim.  Let us buy vaccines families direct US. 
It right protect families - especially complete failure government so.  ethical issue let us protect families absence leadership. I’d wager stores long it’s close big city I’ve seen steroids take? CDC say March hit. March dominant strain. could mean dominant based 20k daily cases 2million daily cases. can’t stand tone. act like “wealthy” ppl getting vaccinated en masse. It’s true. There's annoying bat living tree next house. I'll sign vaccine trial. Good parent! people seem grasp child, anymore, kids brought world. keep safe. something working, find way make work.  Good. Fuck people don’t wear masks / wear incorrectly Also bode well J&amp;J vaccine. Everyone? It’s ppl. work healthcare setting one cutting front me.   Biden 100 Day milestone 

The feds nothing state state lockdowns, purpose. want feds power. literally happened though. Ah, yea, Japan. Honestly, weird part got 7 refusals. would expected exam taker booted one two refusals (in Japan). Stop peddling crap. researchers already explained Let us buy vaccines families direct pharmaceutical companies.  


It right protect families - especially complete failure government so.   


This ethical issue let us protect families absence leadership. it’s sarcasm. Biden limited control happens economically aside sending stimulus checks. Username checks here. government spending much time contacting trying convince people sceptical vaccine get one. people line need badly.  Japan culturally geographically east, economically politically west way, yesterday today I’ve serious body pains. Mostly lower back, shoulder, neck wrists too. I’ve never COVID though, least don’t think I’ve it. lot confounding stuff study..  patients admitted nasty initial wave - possibly sicker, older bunch admitted - would comorbidities would landed hospital soon anyway - may discharged soon - might put ventilators little hastily (this contribute organ failure/ clotting).

Would interesting see stats would hold now. doubt it.  He's Japanese attending school. mental health issues going going out. Lol Taiwan arguably careful-to-the-point-of-paranoid country regarding masks right now. Fuck around find out. No, vaccinated 1% far.... either we? Yeah, going it? Honestly. empirical evidence collected far points world destroying measures done nothing statistically relevant mitigate mortality.

Could maybe stop them? Since they're literally taking future away 20 30 years old?  stop lap two behind. reason downvotes raining you. earned them.  clearly one understanding sarcasm. LOL. affecting substantial number people.

Yes, doesn’t explicitly quantify “substantial”. relative one person South Africa got ended dying, probably think that’s “substantial”. epidemiology, subfield statistics. number disappears rounding start measuring ten-thousandths one percent substantial. 0.00013% 2003 population got SARS-1. According read far, cloth masks barely protect wearer, everybody wearing correctly, significant degree protection. N95 masks lot protective, costly, easily available days. get docked least half bull pulled last denied vaccines per ~~say~~ se...

I'm glad changed opinion 10 minutes immediately try accuse ""not remembering this."" Yes, Japanese parents, would quite embarrassing! Reach local lab, preferably smaller lab (not giants) find get Covid antibody test done. Sometimes need doctor request it. Call PCP ask order test you. doctor jerk, ask lab refer doctor tests go there. 

The truth is, medical field doesn’t want outliers—do say, know better—which fine dandy legitimate reason advocate sorts things. 

You always request copy test results.

I don’t know long antibodies last whether show sometime passed since infection, worth shot. Yeah. nothing since school's let ( I'm teacher) normally I'd lung infection 3 believe smells much associated feel thing smell comes from.

Like smells probably hard wired displeasant, there's limit smell perceived you, makes sense.

That's opinion needs “line sand” date restrictions end regardless percentage people elected get vaccine.

This great idea - deadlines work. Wow. First, mad US faking evidence, want fake evidence. Make mind, dude. feels like sarcastic comment... accurate. Combined vaccines, we're getting point less less people get Covid. like people 2020 forgot death thing old sick people die time time.

Yeah, like 2020 different year terms death rates old people dying ""from time time."" says wear week package, material probably different expect, allow mold build up. go enough test out, point protects week. think also depends breathing, different depending age body build might experience differently. thanks. saving lives. simply can't afford extreme caution right now. sucks. would wear mask too. mention frequent articles morr mutations building up. tensley followed articles UK strain. came articles South African strain may evade vaccines.

I badly want vaccine, snail's pace things moving, know I'll hear dreaded news strain stopped current vaccine. Triggering another year testing.

So yeah. I'm pessimistic. badly want vaccine, yet pessimistic. Pessimism mean antivaxx tourism money Cool agree post, necessarily actions Chinese government took cover led unimaginable damage suffering.

We know sure Wuhan/Hubei local government covered initial outbreak, generalize entire chinese government seems like leap. think equivalent blaming entire european union when, let's say, Italy (similar population Hubei) covered outbreak. think that's fair analogy.

Although probably blame entire U.S. one states covered outbreak, maybe *is* fair? ""abstinence only"" messaging became totally ok boggles mind.

It work sex, work drugs, fuck supposed work ""don't normal human things year+/indefinitely?"" health officials politicians thinking? I’m surprised shots getting eligible arms.

I work hospital I’m legitimately eligible shot. signing appointment, site indicates must show work ID letter employer proving eligibility.

But day shot, able get vaccinated nobody asking see badge employer letter.

So web site text would discourage ineligible people trying cut line, know ignore warning, good chance getting away it. something similar, I’ll share case somehow helps somebody avoid infection. 

First all, plan far ahead things need. use mask gloves get grocery bags porch put 66-qt storage bins. one set aside trash smaller one plastic bags. 

First, sort dry foods, refrigerated, frozen. starting frozen, take anything internal packaging, take picture cooking directions, needed, write is, it’s clear. Anything can’t taken put upright freezer 2 bins things quarantine. may overkill, wait 10 days consider items safe touch. 

Then everything else. Refrigerated items go bottom drawer, bottom door shelf, small lidded container. Dry goods go container shelf. 

For refrigerated dry goods, treat toxic week. Shipped packages opened porch taken packaging, go container. take shipping days account. contents last touched 5 days ago, it’s safe 2-3 days.

After touching ANYTHING another person touched, use gloves, sanitize, wash hands twice. sometimes sanitize again. new baby I’m overweight forties would probably rough time got infected.

Sorry, ended lot text. fly regularly shit I’d absolutely buy one those. We’re barely first quarter game people acting like it’s over. look nation 2% population vaccinated make bold claims who’s approach worked silly. disappinting plan improve already happening. debt hurt. Increased testing travel restrictions February/March would dirt cheap. 

Imagine party could June/July half $ trillion: $10,000 budget, 3-4 weeks per person, 50 million young healthy volunteers. doubt people would criticizing move. may ""thousand fatalities"" program. epidemic would continued spreading likely would seeing 200k fatalities nation wide today. Plus people would (and are) pointing consequences survivors. would way convince anyone alternate (our current) reality 400k people died kids got sick too. 

I hear anyone questioning half arsed lockdowns. got economic damage let virus spread too. seams everyone eager lock extreme view consider angles. safe driver might park car get walk. Alternatively safe driver might continue driving. compromise possibilities quite absurd. Get car without stopping car. Park without pulling parking space. Park car halfway parking space. Somehow managed blow $10 trillion, also ruin small businesses, also let epidemic reach herd immunity, also make everyone miserable discontent. worst part overall pandemic script clear back April basically outlined 1990s. 

We need luck needed leadership. Luck may helpful one day November 2019 someone China near bat. magnitude damage done United States need happen. recovering? I’m long hauler pretty plugged people recovering seen Yup. live KY sold rip arena numerous times past.

It’s amazing much three month thing become imbedded conversation Covid. based study early 2020 could confirm three months immunity that’s long study lasted. New studies keep coming extending length immunity, one seems notice. 

The recent research suggests immunity lasts LEAST 8 months least good vaccine immunity. There’s thing true guarantee, person already got infected pretty much guaranteed safe. I'm sure that's case (mean age study 65). However, article talks ""many people re-admitted new diagnosis. developing heart, kidney, liver problems, well diabetes.""

That seems indicate despite whatever pre-existing medical conditions patients had, significant numbers showing problems discharged hospital. how/why new conditions appeared going require much study. disputable. got vaccine I’m it, you’re basically defending people say covid didn’t kill old person, underlying conditions did. covid pushes edge, covid killed them. vaccine.

Honestly, told last April entire eligible US population would able vaccinated end 2021 believe you. think get real therapeutic market treat Covid, debate. people get virus do, treated quickly. still don’t think restrictions vaccinations finished. need empathy suffer, since mostly plight others responsibility them. safe. OK, US worst flu season past 10 years? 2017-2018 estimated 61000 deaths, 45,000,000 symptomatic cases reported. 19 thus far US? 23,653,919 cases 394,495

It may take little longer many people would die 2-4 years would come end. Cases dropping, that's good. can't anything incoming wave deaths, sadly, people dying next month likely already infected.

Also, could allow tourists vaccinated let least 70% population vaccinated (or Australian wants vaccinated). President-elect Joseph R. Biden unveiled plan jump-start nation’s faltering COVID-19 vaccine effort include establishing mass vaccination sites mobile vaccine clinics around nation.

Biden repeatedly promised administration vaccinate 100 million people first 100 days. ""I'm convinced get done,"" Biden said remarks Friday. ""This time set big goals pursue courage conviction health nation stake,"" said.

The plan calls $20 billion investment national vaccination program. funds included part $400 billion COVID response contained proposed $1.9 trillion COVID relief package Biden hopes get Congress. administration aims ensure Americans receive vaccine zero cost-sharing.

According Centers Disease Control Prevention, 31 million COVID-19 doses been distributed and 12.2 million administered thus far, including 1.3 million residents long-term care facilities. 1.6 million individuals received 2 doses, thus considered fully vaccinated.

In televised speech, Biden outlined five major goals:

Work states expand eligibility anyone age 65 older essential workers continuing vaccinate healthcare workers

Set thousands new, federally supported mass vaccination centers gyms, stadiums, locations — 100 set end first month office; sites would supported Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), mobilize thousands clinical nonclinical staff contractors work state local teams National Guard; Biden seeking federal government cover 100% states' National Guard deployment costs fully cover states' costs Medicaid recipients

Deploy mobile vaccination clinics hard-to-reach, underserved urban rural areas, relying part community-based physicians

""Jump-start"" federal partnership pharmacies increase capacity chains independent outlets

Use full strength federal government ramp supply, means using Defense Production Act help ensure uninterrupted production delivery vaccine vaccine supplies, aim releasing vaccine supply available, keeping small reserve cover unforeseen shortages delays

Increasing vaccination means expanding workforce, taxed ongoing COVID response.

The Biden plan would encourage states allow additional qualified professionals administer vaccines expand scope practice laws waive licensing requirements appropriate. Biden said envisions using military clinicians, FEMA personnel, staff US Public Health Service Commissioned Corps help expand number vaccinators. also said would seek declaration allow certain qualified professionals, including retired medical workers licensed administer vaccines, able appropriate training.

The President-elect also promised transparent. ""We're going make sure state local officials know much supply they'll getting expect get plan,"" said.

He noted officials said getting clear information current administration vaccine supply.

Biden said administration would lead science agencies would ""free political influence.""

Addressing vaccine hesitancy also priority done called ""massive public education campaign rebuild trust, help people understand science tells us — vaccines help reduce risk COVID infections,"" Biden said.

The President-elect also vowed ""equity central COVID response,"" people color, disabilities, seniors would left behind.

Biden acknowledged that, ""We need funding Congress make happen,"" ""may take many months get need be.""  Fucking ridiculous. forget pro athletes come contact lot people. Vaccinating could cut potentially really bad outbreak.   one place study show anything approaching 75% long term effects like China 'study' did. 

I dislike somebody Reddit posts official looking study things proves point, provides synopsis quote. Especially, like I'm case, even show think did. actually read you?

Yet people completely abandoned glorious society. 

Let give example: MS, disease without proper treatment almost certainly put wheelchair. many months year, could even go visit doctor, dared live across border it! lucky live Europe somewhat come senses cross border ... I'd personally prefer death certain irreversibly fucked alternatives.  People always bring control size, miss point: **no one** vaccine suffered severe covid, that's amazing. Umm...

That’s totally reasonable clickbait. think I'll call em whatever fuck want. How's grab ya? “brigading” people comment disagree usual narrative?

Good luck buddy helps maybe try keeping gatorade bedstand wake take bigggg swig, least might help find whats up.   Im sorry hear , I'm definitely downplaying struggle long haulers , I'm trying point far unique covid 19, something feel media failed understand. Paul Varelans aka Polar Bear passed yesterday Covid keep thinking period time need ride worst hope vaccine administered enough people makes difference. post covid issues getting attention be.

TRIED asking nicely?  Agreed I'd miss smelling too.

Tasting also. lot precautions mentioned universally accessible, especially considering caretakers paid dog shit wages. Getting paid $10/hour work almost one wants do, expected quarantine constantly year sustainable. Sure, theoretically everyone want would quit, good luck finding enough staff.

Maybe people start taking parents grandparents homes caring them, instead expecting people judging them. even family can't/won't care them, could anyone pretend caretaker selfish, paid enough? There's reason hard find people willing work, going get worse Boomers hit nursing homes hard. Maybe fault system individual caretakers one looking for, least employers. 

My city basically lockdown, even possible go bar. I've working home year, still understand ways caretakers taken granted dismissed. still people. Ya that's bummer, drive Great Ocean Road without risk international visitor driving wrong side road killing family. go see penguins without knocked international tourists. Ya bummer, risk I'll lose family members friends virus now. downside every nice place regional Victoria busy Victorians holiday stuff.

I can't speak Australia, everyone speak appears happy border closed, wonder NZ cousins feel border closure (maybe dont let us yet - quarantine process hardly perfect)? There's belief among medical profession long Covid symptoms inflammation related. increased inflammation levels occurred infection persist indeterminate time. 

So way resolve would take supplements reduce inflammation safely. Like Vitamin C, Melatonin, Magnesium, Vitamin D. course different supplements work different people etc... i’m healthy 21 year old. start seeing vaccinated people start parties hanging best believe i’m gonna say fuck regardless im vaxed not. pretty sure would case lot people to. governments want people follow restrictions last thing create two tiers life Mostly [family wants Considering anti-maskers opposite political quadrant people promote body positivity (anti-maskers lib-right body positivity people lib-left), entire argument falls flat. Even *without* long term issues. fact people afraid disease 99% survival rate understand statistics work. 

99% mean 100%!

If every elevator went sign stating, ""Warning: elevator 1% chance lethal failure. acknowledge risk using elevator,"" would anybody use them?

What airplanes failure rate 1%? give disinformation platform legitimizes allows spread. Fucking hell.... COVID replicates binding ACE2 receptors damages surrounding area. adults around third people lose sense smell, children like tenth. caused damage shredding olfactory support cells. damage happening body--wherever ACE2 receptors highest distribution, major organs (some others--e.g. pancreas heart, though heart damaged respiratory issues causes), brain stem spinal cord. 

I've seen handful journal articles they've suggested potential mechanisms harm immediately apparent, hypothesis-generating results (e.g. pancreatic damage affecting hormone production, damage around testes causing scar tissue increases testicular temperature lowers fertility, etc.). got really sick 2009. get bed two weeks. newly married without job. go two job interviews heavy cold medication. really good shape that. new job one floor stairs remember completely breath going stairs. 25-ish time thought nothing it. took several months burning feeling left me. also remember burning started trying go exercise bike again. think young correlate sickness decreased lung function.

How hell rubbish getting upvotes? work well multiple staff members leave there's still old people take care of. Australia successfully lockdowns state (or even small part state).

That kills “just islands” theory.  successful lockdowns go hand hand strong borders, Victoria blocking access NSW significantly harder (politically, socially, legally, practically) putting borders different country.

And contact tracing works. NSW proven that.  avoid lockdowns much possible, contact-traced way several outbreaks far. (It take longer crush without lockdowns, it’s bit local argument Oz: hard fast minimal measures much longer tail small numbers keep trickling in.)

Our contact tracing works well use second ring.  test positive, isolated.  contacts quarantined contacts also quarantined.  (This mean 100+ people quarantined per identified case.) Otherwise constantly running behind virus.  get front it, it’s containable. America would say fast. seems want specific opinions allowed general mood shifted different direction, want put back force. great approach discussion! weak elderly ok /s America going another wave.

We're dumb anything anymore.  wish would quantify report accurately. Like one article yesterday said ""thousands"" doses thrown away headline, literally sub-headline said ""unclear"" many. Ok so, thousands unclear?

I think articles designed piss unfortunately inform you. Look Myles Garret Browns, could defensive player year. Got covid, barely catch breath now.  One fittest guys NFL. fair, nobody country gives shit anyone else. wonder asymptomatic case early days. used travel fuck ton internationally, right March 2020. I’m runner, would hold pace somewhere 7:30 range 4-8 miles. Raced tri teens/early 20s would run 6-630 miles races. last January orange theory class tread heart skipped beat started fluttering/quivering, thought heart attack something, left room, front desk people freaked almost called ambulance. bpm graph class showed went like 168 380 minute, came normal ranges (ballpark numbers, graphs suck).

Ever since I’ve worst skipped beat issues/palpitations. still run, fast run like 9min/mile, I’d say average 10ish usually. Pretty fucking weird. tragic loss life.  Exactly.

There instances people coming strep, heal best go visit doctor get antibiotics, run chance vegetation heart leading endocarditis. We've seen people come vegetation kidneys cause renal failure. one huge difference covid strep: antibiotics. virus cured like bacteria can. needs run course, case strep cleared round two zpack.

Again, need calm down. Talking ""wanna scientists"" demonstrated zero understanding science even works 🙄 government wait long lockdown last two weeks aged 10 years alone. sure anyone really knows. guess knew, they'd fix it.

Operation ""Warp Speed"" set get doses states actual administration left them, reportedly lot involvement CDC. part gone well could state governors administrators talk unprepared, underfunded overwhelmed.

My take plan leave states cases cities end 50-100 different plans.

I think overcomplicated phases 1a, 1b, 1c, that, places like NY imposing heavy fines following rules. Everyone arguing ""essential"" worker that.

Also large state like California might 5000 places get vaccine. give 3 million doses that's 600 per location. sure happens many doses sent one place enough another. logistical problem epic proportions states never plan it. engaged Amazon UPS something.

Here long article this: said one think rollout disaster. We're close 1 million vaccinations per day close flu vaccine. definitely see ramping twice within weeks. vaccinate 45-50 million people cover high risk population hospitalizations fatalities fall 80%+. smell 9 months. I’m starting get back. contributed problem giving gym money.  Losing taste would terrible Florida wide open. 75 degrees today, warming next week. freedom ends actions harm others. messaged privately  (1 * 100) / 8 = 12.50

This would write code get percentage. I'm sure people still argue computers right though don’t see doesn’t violate HIPAA. Like regardless personal opinion see getting thrown first court challenge would fine sentiment horrible decisions didn’t affect many people. Catching highly infectious disease huge consequences population large. US staring 400k dead, many people innocent bystanders “live free die” idiots. 

The absolute lack social awareness attitude sickening. government needs ban flights except getting essential stuff like food seeing believe curious see it. Worldometers seem show big change yet. XSTJ's gotta love em ""terminally ill"" mean die tomorrow. might live another 6 months. 

But yeah, vaccines could given someone else.

However figuring optimal sequence giving vaccines would take much time simply give everyone still breathing.

I think safe say without vaccine, 20k 80+ year old people, half would die due covid-19 coming years. sad people passed away sacrifice helped lot others able live last years without fear lot's visits relatives friends. what's vaccine-escape ? calm, nice strawman

That's strawman black labrador dOnT lEcTuRe Me

Grow offended, assumptions aren’t tight though

I'm making assumptions, that's literally *don't* scientific method, I'm advocating scarce data already collected enough warn long term problems, dampen spread.

If admittedly ""scarce"", inherently peerreviewed study best way accumulate even cases onset new diseases.

We need wait peer reviewed sources encourage people continue taking precautions. There's already abundance evidence showing efficacy masks social distancing. nothing wait 4years warn longterm problems mild cases till larger sample sizes, sounds right

Yes....literally. medical association issues recommendations without peer reviewed pointed waiting peerreviewed data already seen phenomenon several times might suited combat pandemic, especially half population refuses take action...

Let's pretend information long term effects convince covid hoaxers take precautions. They've already demonstrated inability pass marshmallow test, they're going afraid *potential* long term damage *may* self-limiting suitable overview, would literally wait till pandemic done evaluate data correctly possible... see problem?

No. There's literally reason can't start clinical trials now. sure think happen pandemic believe propaganda, misstrued information applicable, extensively don’t listen anecdotal data till peer reviewed data gathered till now, enough make statement.

You agree beyond reach logic danger we're already 100% sure virus cause, research matter - people lost cause talking first place. Additionally, experts say one thing scare people research later shows something benign, increase distrust medical experts. ask possible pandemic survived

There already people almost year post-covid. exactly ""wait pandemic over"" see lungs heart now? argument research makes thing phenomenon observed several times, mentioning don’t know exactly phenomenon happens idiocy,

This entire sentence idiocy. whole point research would determine common phenomenon actually long could generally last. one disputing long term effects, question *incidence*, understanding. stories vaccines ending garbage pisses every time see them. damn infuriating actually really think people afraid point.

It´s high morals (even though a-moral hell) breaking system. triage heck people careful. don't, well, loss. focused able help 100% people? 

I'd let population know get covid going triage tent first. choice want take chance. young, probably do, old; stay fck home. Yes! feeling better two days, yesterday started coughing today mouth tastes like battery acid (but still can’t taste smell anything else). It’s maddening.

No. Read wrote again. listed doses purchased said people many covers full course (which half number doses).

Here’s official list.  I’m doubling say.  example extremely clear they’ve bought 51 million doses Novavax, alone enough cover entire population.

People given up. Go store. packed. Mitigation weapon vs spread level. Yes, mid late summer people vaccinated(but children raises whole issue), many people unnecessarily die. still remember people cheering deaths 200 day mid summer. See, look, deaths 90% would say.

This misinfo/fake news looks like, even Reuters fact check gets completely debunked Corbett. retract article? Probably not. get something straight, I'm free say want! That's asking ""please stop"". ironic! 

Don't worry bro prevent getting vaccine sure hell stop wearing mask sew one onto face care.

Most credit goes lady appointed Vaccines Tsar (I forget name, sorry), yes Government take credit making one good appointment whole farrago ineptitude corruption. Although, since countries Germany US carrying vaccinations rate pro rata populations, one wonder perhaps rocket science. Israel, course, well ahead.

But lot credit goes many thousands on-the-ground NHS staff, Manchester drive-thru vaccination centre rushed buy various bits pieces figured would need heard vaccine exposed light, take one example. think thank Johnson that, somehow. Fish can't infected even mammal, need worry 😄 places hard believe isn’t case. Place like Southern California crazy infection rates.  I'm definitely getting seeing anecdote complete stranger Dubai! Thanks sharing. saved life. God rabies scary. Good her. People actually dying vaccine, undeniable!

Good point! again, may chance catching corona could result death well. course, jury one, seeing year since virus first emerged. wtf. happened sub? news front page? Holy shit. bigger news mono 2004...in 2009 got Hodgkin Lymphoma..most likely caused case mono. Maybe referring covid vaccine. Waiting get covid vaccine. Brazil, Federal Council Gynecology went record saying “woman planning get pregnant try get pregnant taking two doses vaccine”.

However “planning get pregnant” broad term. wish used “woman trying get pregnant”, cousins saying won’t take vaccine “for now” might make women sterile. probably read fake news distorted easy misunderstand statement. People long term issues likely report thread, causes bias well.

That's say people ignore this, need necessarily lose hope got infected. US government care wellbeing citizens and, part, citizens care others' wellbeing either.

It's silly paint failure. Indifference human suffering FEATURE US, bug. country got stepping corpses SILLY NAIVE expect time different. Policies useless actually damaging world right now. maddening.

We invest investing locking young healthy individuals nothing protecting elders. Care homes still outbreaks 10 months this. unacceptable given whole excuse destroy economy depriving everyone freedom protect them. help one bit. think studies 2-3 months behind today's date, naturally. So, data JAMA scientific studies has, include holiday spike. think going pretty holiday spike statistics available. Free tvs. Fuck sakes raised related question ago modded down.

What kind criteria used determine gets treatment hospital?

Suppose bad covid case requires two weeks hospital. weighted people critical injuries also need hospital care, need shorter treatment?

Patient needs two weeks hospital else die. Patient B needs two days hospital else die. time required patient could used save 7 people like patient B.

Of course need weigh survival chances whatnot, seems patient B get priority, patient less load hospital patient A. Biden 100 million goal aiming 100 million people vaccinated end first 100 days, 100 million doses administered? it’s doses, that’s 50 million people vaccinated end April, would underwhelming.  ignored airborne transmission, aerosolized. Big difference. airborne. biggest concert vaccine trackers ending ton competing standards.

I made appointment new _Apple_ vaccine. costs lot, resistant mutations twice long Google one name show blue FBI's 5G surveillance equipment.

Sure, everyone gets Microsoft one cheap, wait come knocking door give extra jab take answer. summer Australia. US also screw pooch summer, still. channel support curb number cases intelligent way

just recently country announced state emergency one rule clearly remember political ""game"" duration emergency

but political group audacity organise public event distribute free frozen chickens first 1000 visitors without authority's approval. people storming crowded spot get free chicken

in point view, intention helping people fish votes. even event poster picture political figure occupy good large portion poster.

the good news fined organising event, damage done. personally, think thought could get away easily like politicians state emergency, wish law enforcers could removed double standard first wave even emerges. I’ll wait see peer reviewed article topic (there may well already one I’ve missed) - it’s possible patients contracted covid pulmonary diseases we’re aware of. majority patients seen hospital setting covid months prior residual recurrent symptoms (though personal experience also anecdotal) recent flight restriction, looks like UK gov finally (10 months late) realized good idea Island limit inbound tourist flights. However £valuable tourist industry pre-covid19 small fraction covid19.  Ai papi 🤤 ""I research"" crowd like 6 months later dad still cant remember anything. Lost 99% brain function   Neutralising means likely vaccinated infecting others, right? got Oxford jab 👍 (NHS nurse) gets trickier sadly easy analogies fall apart. best answer give COVID 19 exist November 2019, way knowing long immunity last.

Slightly less good answer: virus seems mutate fairly slowly, slower influenza much slower rhinoviruses cause common cold. mutates slowly there's good reason believe vaccine good least couple years, better flu shot.

Are people's immune system able cope even vaccine? Yes, immunodeficiencies caused drugs, disease, genetic conditions leave defenseless. Additionally vaccines work certain ages, babies may also unprotected. that's reason vaccines fully effective, also complicated reasons way trigger body's immunity, disease mutates quickly. Still, people vaccinated disease rare, even people without immunity protected. I'm Aussie Europe. Dad side family live Australia seen close 2 years due obvious circumstances. really hope case entire 2021. understand could buy (overpriced) flight bite bullet take hotel quarantine - 3k AUD price tag ""wasted"" two weeks quite off-putting. really hope reconsider year goes along. realise add anything discussion, venting. would depend however yeah, work safe assumption goes well it’s government involved goes badly government involved. 
Compare test trace - local health authorities great job Hancock/Harding/Serco got involved. Well, vaccines haven’t distributed yet. They’re on/off switch. Wait see situation looks following widespread vaccination tell think doing. Due climate, north also risk right now. 
In warmer climates, people outside.

Also couple hundred cases north. 

That would like someone Morocco starting worry hundred cases Sweden... Language determines thought processes. someone speaks english native tongue think english. yes, mental habits common entire country. Please keep wearing mask get vaccinated. There's lot misinformed people there. “Undeniable”

Elderly people serious underlying health condition died receiving vaccine - hospice. Health officials currently investigating died vaccinated vaccine.

I Personal think shouldn’t provoke immune response vaccine someone critical ill!

The trials shown undeniable vaccines safe - nothing risk free 1 100000 may get allergic reaction may get temporary facial paralysis... easily treatable gone time. 

Death consequences long covid aren’t!

You free take vaccine - course!
What free spread misinformation!

Please stop! mean tourism international trade point, sure. need take rushed mrna vaccine 

You pretending well researched informed yet even realised mRNA vaccine.   entirely possible. mean... give old people vaccine get virus lol. Problem solved. imagine Vietnam different locals level disposable income Australia/New Zealand actually found tourism suffered less initially expected people travelling domestically. tourism industry still suffered though. I'm specialist. friend got experimental program. think commercially available yet. woods yet, side-effects far less one would expect chemo. mRNA cancer vaccines customized target specific patient's cancer mutations. far know, experimental mRNA cancer vaccines melanoma, prostate lung cancer. Haha, fucking $5 dose less. 

Do know 'false economy' means? Ah yes, youtube research.  I’ve heard 21st. bet week tho We're losing GDP per quarter COVID Brexit could ever hope lose us. shorten pandemic even 1 quarter, Brexit worth it. Six say!? Wanna come US? trade countries lol. Given healthy young people among last get vaccinated eager go concerts travel, would incentivise line cutting fighting vaccines go.

The younger generations already expected sacrifice careers elderly expect lasting economic damage, they'd get banned shows (despite corona much risk late 20s) asked get vaccinated last benefit society?

Anyway, moot venues airports reopen vast majority audience vaccinated. would refuse significant number paying customers, they'd stay closed weeks longer. risk anyone understand EU works, deals crisis. Risk would joining it. doesn’t. Covid nature’s way culling stupid humans. Covid blessing woman work hit car parking lot. hospital treated hip fracture accident, discovered undiagnosed rabies. doubt MLK day US choose Mondays order influence market  EU done much member state taking delivery vaccines must also take risk. 475 deaths per million. Better compared Germany Western countries. Yeah like $5 less via EU.. 

Complete false economy. lesson learned pandemic buy early, pay high. economic damage pandemics far beyond price vaccines. said everything? Oh ya...you! 

Want try debunk fake news? doubt guys clearly done homework unlike you. 

He literally debunks Reuters supposed ""fact check""! 
Watch learn! There's limited supply vaccines makes sense prioritize places literally save lives. Every vaccine sent Australia moment vaccine sent somewhere else. 

The issue places approved vaccines done emergency use legislation. Can't really one getting sick/dying. 

My last point better promise deliver. Prepare people worst. like England say lockdown open xmas backtrack things turn projected.

Life pretty good Australia. People things without restrictions, can't travel. also politically difficult tolerance loss life become low, people happy feeling safe even requires trade-offs. dad prostate cancer screening cancelled 2 times already. booked april last year.

Hospitals 100% laser focused covid only, least Italy might due economical incentives (2k euro hospital covid+ patient admitted, per day. Even patient, like many have, hospital non severe symptoms admitted he/she says he's able self isolate home) political shortsightedness. Denying cancer screening kills people. Statistically, decide covid patients gets priority saving people, deciding dies covid patient cancer patient 5 years now. literally said thing yesterday, ever see another pandemic declared I’m going take gun I’m buying exact scenario I’m ending it. Fuck shit Again, opinions. topic complex monopoly truth here. Let people speak try convince arguments, silencing them. Dang. Tough way find glad found got worse. Hoping good things long, happy future.  exact kind crisis/emergency Brexiters claimed EU handle, would look that. 

A key Brexiter argument EU waits absolute last possible moment make decision, times crisis, nightmare get 28 countries agree. call Big Sexy nothin! weird know article 2003, research that's come since often women's health issues misdiagnosed clueless doctors, like example [this report](http://www.heartandstroke.ca/-/media/pdf-files/canada/2018-heart-month/hs_2018-heart-report_en.ashx) Heart Stroke Foundation 2018. even link provided seems contradict saying second Feinstein, PhD, Brian

(Meanwhile one ctrl+c ctrl+v me?) I'm dumber read  same.... many people suffer years like fucking clue what's coming would good offset carbon emissions (and driving, presumably), would great. I've read, antibodies remain longterm. positive antibody test would reflect recent infection.  FYI country vaccinations fastest world. means UK getting vaccine September. ecclectic group loonies, led Billy Te Kahika. Mostly influenced online conspiracy theories relating Covid US Democrat world cabal conspiracies like Q. Easily forged? 400,000,000 doses ordered end July. That's enough vaccinate essentially everyone eligible. Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine lower efficacy mRNA vaccines, ca. 70 %, need larger fraction population vaccinated reach herd immunity. found efficacy data Johnson &amp; Johnson. Right yeah. need keep super cold, pharmacy it. tons locations opportunities administer them. Keeping less concern J&amp;J (and Oxford). seen used much outside English speaking (mostly US) media. Sorry hear that. grandfather got shot morning. Seems ok far, touch wood. *UK variant entered chat* Thanks!! fucking hate people focus (and dismiss) death rate without even taking account. one week read two stories two different women 30s suffering debilitating effects covid. One heart renal damage severe doctor gave less 5 years live. 

My weight puts high-risk category, although I'm working it. Still, frightened much dying does. watched dad die organ failure found mom dead house two years twenties. son 9. can't imagine putting that.

We going seeing time goes on. 16s cannot receive vaccine yet even less question. I'm commenting fact article headline making front page sub.

For reference, question:

""All right. So, look, oversee vaccine creation, I'm curious manufacturing aspect things. President-elect Biden promised invoke DPA, Defense Production Act, vaccine manufacturing process. help short term, something -- see benefits summer?"" Here's hoping make full speedy recovery! Send best wishes way. reminder, absolutely medical advice kind permitted. **Anyone even hinting obtain prescription medication without valid legal prescription qualified licensed medical provider permanently banned.** mayor wants allow indoor dining somehow squash underground parties. 

Translation: mayor wants allow killing people money, prohibit killing free. lot Covid fatigue well. We've seen far restrictions Canada compared US. People want something. 38 year old Type 1 diabetes I'm looking getting vaccinated April/May Canada. I'm American get chance go get vaccine would 100% it. Yes hence 110m adult population 55m UK stuff *should* plastered media past 6 months more, decree -- especially channels like fox news. (I would given ultimatum, broadcast informational mini-documentaries lose broadcasting licenses)

It might triggered enough fear response improve covid response. population US vs UK? LOL legit never Asia? Well going per percentage doses given/doses hand. Though chart might little outdated Oh yikes that's good true  Agreed.

The vaccines 100% either protected enough virus's food source (people) die out. outbreaks like measles Disneyland whopping cough still happen.

This exactly still need vaccinations. vax / herd immunity got 100% got rid virus's then... still need give people born today. one believe unless produce physical evidence? Chest X-rays, bloodwork on. need get doctor test use energy get tests. educate ask specific tests. Lmao Right? Like wish would quit putting bunch unrelated opinions 2 color coded options fight progress sound scientific backing. Drive-thru vaccinations possible it,

Are possible vaccines? There’s already acting deficits hawks Biden’s COVID relief plan. Even COVID largest federal deficit seven years, silent. uk strain right? states restrictions effect first wave (that effectively unenforced). That's Lol I’m friends senators son. grandmother can’t even get vaccine. It’s shit show vs great “inequity” scheme exactly trying say? saying reading said, parts study cited earlier thread definitely apply case terms severity described. remember citing study, disqualify anything original point recovery potential future long term damage issues. think possibly throwing saying want hear point. thats choice im going argue. Good luck. Ok, scrap entire vaccine wait vaccinate Moderna becomes available late summer?

Not happening. sure wish us 😐 saying everyone. comment limited specifically said vascular damage healed 6 months. 

We invested parties. use fucking logic. dont know may happen future anyone else. truly think know novel virus effect anyone 10 20 years time least informed person there. novel virus. definition know. Yeah really good idea risk getting moderately serious athlete, especially really good idea effects are. reduced person's physical performance even say 10% could completely swing competitive results, average person probably even notice decrease. Gotta applaud this. First time whole pandemic seem got together sorted out. 

Fair play. Let’s hope continues.   vaccine doesnt work expected, expect mass panic.  Yeah exactly it’s combination factors. Israel example didn’t produce vaccines it’s still leading world terms jabs given percentage population, extremely well run health system whole country military, know get something done. 

The U.K. like said benefit producing one cheapest easiest distribute vaccines. can’t stress enough lucky developed Oxford since forced AstraZeneca sell vaccines basically cost price. Oxford also best immunology public health departments world we’re lucky regard. 

I think Canada decent job keeping infections down? yeah shame you’re developing own. specific reason Canada didn’t try develop vaccine?  Let's say 407k. consolation, UK higher per capita death rate US, handled worse Trump did. phrase exist.
The UK paying massive vaccine infrastructure performance awful. get negative headlines entire UK media-sphere Tory arse. UK moving lot faster now. want vaccinated everyone August iirc. bruh there's pandemic like sahab? Amazing numbers. goes well past early next year forever everyone country fully vaccinated.  noticed indian origin cousin mine struggled teach english, seemed use 'buddy' lot moved usa. still remember asshole argued daily thread one day admitted perfectly okay mental health issues people developed, job loss financial instability, stunting children’s development collateral damage lockdowns. 

If anything, hopefully pandemic people pretend care mental health stop pretending. hand, trials Oxford vaccine tested participants regularly, reducing apparent efficacy rate cases prevented, severity reduced probably detected often.

Is... true? I'm Astrazenaca trial right tested time first shot. simply report symptoms come every weeks get blood drawn. experience eat pizza buffet Austin.

Smokers eat higher levels fruits vegetables get beta carotene decreased risk lung cancer smokers take beta carotene supplements elevated risk lung Whiteboard Doctor addresses NIH clinical studies showed benefits worsening disease ivermectin use,11-14

by examining 4 studies NIH cites statement above.

Here rough transcript:


&amp;nbsp;


9:20 minute mark:

I thought interesting statement. we've covered almost studies there.

There we've missed. almost - remember showed worsening disease.

So actually went sources 11-14 .. cited references - 11-14 clicked 11 14 pulled up.

Cause want see studies were, cause know .. curious us ..


&amp;nbsp;



at 9:50 minute mark:

This first one:

a 5 day course ivermectin treatment covid19 may reduce duration illness .. (11 Ahmed)

we actually covered this, ivermectin-covid19 playlist, check video interested diving study.

But study much .. know showed increase virological clearance received ivermectin - cleared virus 9.7 days compared 12.7 days (in placebo) statistically significant.

Now think NIH's touching added doxycycline ivermectin, actually lost benefit.

Alright - little odd.


(NOTE: Dr video well - - Ivermectin Alone Effective Ivermectin Doxycycline - Dec 9, 2020)

(NOTE: Dr points 1:00 minute mark feels study balanced - dose ivermectin shorter ivermectin-doxycycline arm, 5 days ivermectin ivermectin-alone arm)


I think says worsening disease - anything neutral study, makes beneficial depending interpret results here.


&amp;nbsp;



at 10:45 minute mark:

Alright next study - one:

over 5 day course ivermectin covid19 - shocker (12 - Chachar)

And actually one think we've covered - reading little tough figure exactly did.

But essentially said open label randomized control trial - alright - May June 2020 - looked 25 patients group.

So 50 patients total.

In one group got ivermectin, othe not.

And groups similar (!)

Some see - fever myalgias dyspnea commonest - oh similar groups.

Ah - cough seemed control group.

Let's see - diarrhea vomiting common control group.

And followed patients day 7 said hey - guys symptomatic symptomatic day 7.

And I'm trouble actually interpreting results sentence (?)

Out 25 patients, 64 percent asymptomatic rest 36 percent (?) also asymptomatic.

I assuming meant asymptomatic (?)

In control group, 60 percent asymptomatic, rest asymptomatic assuming must symptomatic (?)

And saying statistically significant.

So guess - covered study detail, maybe should.

Cause tough gain abstract exactly exactly looking at.

Looks like found difference symptom resolution day 7.

So anything neutral trial - we'd dive - see limitations has.


&amp;nbsp;



12:30 minute mark:

Here's another one looked at:

I'll show - 13 Chowdhury.

A randomized trial ivermectin-doxycycline HCQ-azithromycin therapy

And actually covered study - ivermectin-covid19 playlist.

And actually found - compared ivermectin doxycycline combination therapy call group - (compared) hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin called group B.

And obviously hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin longer recommended therapy.

But actually found ivermectin-doxycycline combination showed trend towards superiority.

So statistically significant, study powered find statistical significance.

It find quantitative improvement ivermectin-doxycycline compared hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin.

So again, technically neutral.

But powered find statistical significance.

And definitely find worsening.


&amp;nbsp;



at 13:20 minute mark:

And last one talked 14 Soto.

And one cover either.

And one come back - interesting study though.

It huge population study looking different treatments nation Peru.

So huge amount confounding variables look cause mortality patients.

Let's see many - many thousands - 5683 patients.

And essentially found look like benefits hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, azithromycin cause mortality patient population.

So benefit look harm.

But dive study too.


&amp;nbsp;



at 14 minute mark:
 
But 4 studies commented said either neutral showed harm.

We see showed harm.

Some actually seem show benefit, neutral.

Otherwise (?) - studies showed shorter duration - time resolution disease, greater reduction inflammatory markers.

Shorter time viral clearance.

And lower mortality rates.


And cite let's see 15 18 studies we've looked before.

They say though - true - accurate - studies reported incomplete information significant methodological limitations.

THe counter argument pandemic.

And lot studies time funding large randomized blinded trials


&amp;nbsp;


(NOTE: funding generics trials inherently low company lock drug)


&amp;nbsp;


Again people though ivermectin's medication much money made.

And critique statement financial investment run huge studies.

And big studies tend take time.

And counter argument also time big studies.

Now ton drugs like Remdesivir - lot trials driven parent companies Gilead Remdesivir.

Whereas Ivermectin kind financial backing.


&amp;nbsp;


(NOTE: Dr. Hazan funding trial - said Merck interested funding trial - reference news story available)


&amp;nbsp;


So arguments counter arguments.

So say sample sizes small.

There varying dosing varying scheduled dosing - true right.

We'd like one dose efficacious trials use dose.

Some randomized trials blinded - meaning participants investigators knew getting ivermectin, not.

Some know ivermectin compared bunch different drugs. said really tell whether ivermectin something else efficacious.


&amp;nbsp;


16:00 minute mark

The severity covid19 well describe studies, outcomes always clearly measured (?)

So fair, critiques true, that's look larger kind sample evidence.

Rather single study cases.

So said limitations cannot draw definitive conclusion clinical efficacy safety ivermectin - results adequately powered, well designed, well conducted enough.

And need well designed well conducted larger trials make definitive conclusion.

So right saying recommendation changed recommend use ivermectin, recommend either use.


&amp;nbsp;


16:40 minute mark

So want share today.

It's kind breaking news feel ivermectin efficacious, actually pretty big win.

And remember statement. wait formal recommendation posted well. mRNA vaccines contain tiny part viral genome codes specifically virus spike protein, inside biocompatible molecule deliver inside cell. Instead whole virus replicate inside body's cells spread exponentially, vaccine cause limited number cells produce inert spike proteins, immune system see foreign body eliminate, training see future Sars-CoV-2 process. body eliminates cells still producing spike proteins (the way would eliminate cells infected virus) end process trace vaccine left body, done job training immune system stop actual virus. Rumor 21st January. According CDC, majority Americans chronic disease (6 True mild patients often think severe disease either, then, long haulers still happen be.

I'd like know sure not, vaccine prevents this. probably would get anyway, knowing past danger, 1 month since first dose vaccination, would give much relief. even care it'd still recommendable use masks September (I'd use them), want damage Even infect everyone, odds excellent everyone make it,

Like others said you’re contagious first couple weeks (tho may longer severe case) tests still come positive long you’re longer contagious. it’s 90 days everyone **up to** 90 days. Weightlifting cardio component.

And athletes, slight athletic impediment change lifestyle. case couch potatoes. Florida literally cannot get PCR test right unless specifically requested Dr everyone's sent rapid tests.

This gone throughout entire pandemic there's way we're state it.

That's gotta mess reinfection numbers studies Honestly wish could walk steps without winded. I'm 23 feel like I'm 60 Thanks, Captain Obvious. America. dollar important anything. heard training differentiate smells try get back. works people know much people getting back time vs training something. live kentucky girlfriend never heard ""chest drawers"" explained like skinny dresser. Didnt know else explain it... didnt know cultural thing. guess thought thats called lol agree. This, however, first rodeo. children little one one ever born pandemic. stressed before. mention simply enough ridiculously wealthy people skew numbers much. 1% only... 1% demand vaccine even cheating affect things much.

PS: Also poor people cheating too. know people work hospitals got relatives vaccinated saying ""volunteers"" nonsense. Nobody checking guidelines, based honor system there's lot dishonorable people incomes. Yeah, something nasty last February. sickest family been. brother wife kids too. Wiped month. likely Covid symptoms match tested negative.
Might keep masks going indefinitely.  That’s scary. Sorry good luck son. I’ve read reintroduction training best.  Even feels good, take easy. Hopefully issues pass. details feel comfortable sharing? Oh yeah. can’t 2-3 drinks I’m screwed. It’s healthier anyway, don’t mind limit. went period drinking socially lot, left gastritis sort ulcer. Whoopsies You’re first I’ve heard say something positive Coach K. mentioned something little back got roasted social media take. People dragged him, saying team better year, wouldn’t keen disrupt season. 😡 CDC estimates 100 million people United States alone contracted virus, considering never tested. Thats 30% country. Chances many us infected ran mild course. Crazy. Didn’t find trump admin lost second doses? know someone spent 2 weeks hospital oxygen 4 months mention restrictions freedom.

(/s) According COVID TP, hospitalizations dropped around January 1st-2nd levels, what's causing slow drop hospitalizations now? Frankly, I'm sure Japan's response wrong.

Also, xenophobic Japan it... self-preservation. Large parts Japanese economy very, heavily tourism dependent. Japan literally can't afford kind blatant xenophobia. 

Before COVID-19, increasing Japan's already high tourist numbers core part national economic strategy.

Japan ""foreigner, get out"" mentality. tools arsenal fight with.

The Japanese constitution even allow things like national mask mandate, national curfews, mandatory shutdowns businesses deemed non-essential.

Japan arrows quiver, fought had... travel ban. sure. somebody smart, even one person room, plan discussed scale production billions. I’m actually using Defense Production Act telling vaccine manufacturer US they’re making formula. I've wondered mild version know. heart weird beat beating thing acting like trying restart. never stops beating it'll go periods it'll go

Elsewhere Bay Area, they’re either rich able distance homes smaller less people single household. takes younger careless members household socialize got rapid spread. It’s really similar vibe LA. This! don’t want people catch Covid know it’s horrendous lungs. played lot Rec soccer I’m saddened players won’t play rate used to. I’m glad haven’t caught yet that’s one thing fear most: cardiovascular performance issues. guess one one less fill ICU. Nah starting see cases started america prior november. There’s never gonna second third generation vaccine that’s 100% effective zero side effects. Covid won’t exception. 

Fauci experts also saying since May virus isn’t gonna get eradicated, that’s things US got really bleak. 

The risk level never gonna zero. idea pushing “one life lost many” guilt trip people gonna make possible save everybody absurd. People need jobs. often know hard job they're already it. *think* pay increases, might help retention. hard work sure, it. sister got thanks asshole coworker knew took meds caused immunosuppressed. got Covid, ended bacterial pneumonia bottom lungs. Got put prednisone oxygen well. Tried going steroids ended ER sat 70s. One set IV steroids chest X-ray showed fuck lot scarring (one lung basically opaque) maybe pneumonia again, she’s back high dose steroids, antibiotics, still oxygen machine. can’t take 5-10 steps gasping breath. take 5 mins get breath back. dr told apply disability case. It’s really fucking unfair. 

I’m waiting thousands civil suits filed people knowingly sick didn’t care. 

Apparently vent that. recommend coping mechanisms share? hope actually read article, realize says nothing worth worrying about. Exactly. possible J&amp;J saw slower establishing clinical trials Moderna Pfizer, intentionally tried single dose strategy differentiate themselves, otherwise they'd Johnny-come-lately Covid vaccine arena. Reading comments, symptoms people list place either virus miracle virus anxiety factors play huge role.

I know personal experience anxiety weird stuff body. period last spring heart rate automatically went 30-40bpm entered medical office (high risk setting). go minutes later back normal.  Extra fatigue, lungs feel smaller, heart palpitations time. That's I'm experiencing, otherwise healthy, early 20s male. lingering effects blows. literally writing Covid fan fiction.

You also read article. makes nervous. husband November. slept almost day week half. Got care pets aquariums crashed right after. goal make sure received normal care matter wouldn’t fair them. 
For whole month miserable. Taste smell went two weeks ish. suspect smell still isn’t 100% it’s weird things randomly can’t smell 
I’ve active workouts prior November struggling after. lost much muscle strength get tired half assed workout. Felt like 1 month Covid killed nearly full year fitness progress. 

Now guess wait shoe drop... Hotel quarantine still effective solution keeping out. vaccine 100% effective that’s cost letting citizens normal lives, it. I'm going assume actually read article. generally fine outside pandemics. actually read article? clickbait nonsense, kind study. talks 59 year old man, zero context health history. Canadian, tell numbnuts right well! Hell, neighbors either side basically ""cOvId fLu"" open everything, freedom sort people, really need keep mouth shut/ignore/avoid much can. herd immunity talking 2021 isn’t happening anyway. People keep saying magic number high 85%. Chances vaccine kids 12 next year. That’s 15% right there. premise we’re vaccinating every single person 12 years old. Yep. Ok.  
Either goal really isn’t true herd immunity it’s bullshit again. looked comorbdities hospitalized patients. overall comorbidities deaths op suggested. honest india handled better did, hospitalizations deaths like anything, covid wards empty now, botched september really picked making fantasy doomsday scenario, obviously nothing anything clickbait article read. post removed cannot verify reliable source.

This study, anecdotal clickbait local news station. absolutely new information, nothing children. sucks, I'm sorry gone through. 

I think problem we're using term ""long-hauler"" cover lot different experiences. Clearly many long-haulers terrible case get-go, even since summer I've hearing cases people apparently recovered mild case suddenly struck debilitating symptoms last months. need diverse vocabulary talk covid, clearly slow? priority US health care system vaccinate people?

Even 5% US registered nurses assigned vaccinate public full time, 7 hours day, 5 days week. Assuming 4 vaccination administrated hour. means 100 million vaccination less 25 days.  caught COVID. Initially neglegable coughing. 2 weeks ago, go hospital hard time breathing. he’s ICU.

Alright! When? Yea socialist healthcare works America. Palestinians accept it, could seen major blow optics Palestine legitimate state treated like province Israel. Funny thing, universal healthcare government foots bill motivated deal expensive cases.   Mass vaccination inherently difficult, increasing difficulty restricting vaccine designated groups appears exacerbating problem. Deaths clustered mostly amongst older population, goal harm reduction get rapidly.

I concerned still vaccine doses freezers peoples arms. find hard understand how, months time plan, adequate mass vaccination centers established. appears though planners thinking conventionally thinking ways increase staffing get throughput up. centers operating 24/7 long vaccine doses available? Idk. I'm using example quackado. One said .5 infected. One said 1%. There's definitive death rate still ongoing. We’ll get buddy. Cheers Don’t know pretty much assumed would happen US. Isn’t whole economic political system based premise rich people’s lives worth more? New corona virus variant dropped mean Cristiank Ronaldo world class atlethes, I'm afraid that's bad comparison.

I’m glad made through, hope recover back 100%! med that?

So much “But it’s 99% survivable” dicks Quit pretending oppressed isnt funny anymore likely downvoted suggesting something covid=apocalypse made assuming comment research understanding topic. particular article little information. topic posted multiple news organizations little bit effort find articles compare would expected normally much higher covid patients. account ages comorbidities still seeing large spike health concerns admitted first time. numbers Japan great relative rest world wtf talking throwing capital letters round, huh?

Yea, whatever cause hope gets help needs without much drama, story kind makes pity him. confirmed covid? board 6 months: well it’s 99 percent won’t spread need mask indefinitely case one percent. Correct. Even new variant pops up, current trajectory gets vulnerable vaccinated starting today. we're able contain virus least people hospitalized, different path entirely last 10 months. That's beautiful. hope guys best time.

We lots activities (walks, games books, art, cooking, etc.). think, 4 yr old least, starting get bored 4 walls. many many? teacher, thank much. hate school systems shutting down. places petri dishes pandemic. teachers constantly out. I've seen substitutes ever career. 

There reason everyone continually put risk schooling places hybrid model/shorter school days. kids absolutely nothing school.  You’re right. checked exposure log iOS exposure notifications shows app running exchanging codes six times day. Sorry misinformation! I'm also struggled ongoing fatigue energy crashing afternoon, months. barely read adminium bars keeping family safe almost year (woah). zombies coming we're going out. Delivery life ridiculous, I'm grateful afford one's gotten thing (especially infant!). one things wife afraid of. people say “It’s 99% survival rate” always say, 1st don’t want sick 2 weeks secondly, one knows long term effects are! Exactly figured would do.

You're using deaths stand hospitilizations. making incorrect assumption deaths hospitilizations carry relation age. IE population dies 630x rate population Z, Pop also hospitilizes 630x rate Pop Z.

[See Columns 2 match use death data back faulty claim hospitilizations, work. 90% hospitilizations due COVID come 10% population. 


Everything ""in words"" based faulty pretext. No, 50M vaccinations eliminate risk overwhelming hospitals. think 50% either, admit could sufficient high rate undiagnosed COVID among holdouts. vaccines relatively high rate sterilizing immunity. need stop looking every COVID hospitalization excess burden hospital happened COVID exist. Believe not, old people die time. like COVID exist, elderly people currently dying COVID would invincible.

This help case much saying ""These targeted vaccines help much think hospital burden they'll something else weeks months."" Poor dude might mental health issues also [around-the-head things wear mash certain that, worn correctly, form strong enough seal around nose/mouth like 99% breath goes mask, glasses/goggles fog up. bendable metal things nose, pack little sticky, soft foam strips apply inside fill gaps keep mask tightly sealed. need better plan like innoculation centers already place. NYU hospital, example, someone doesn’t make appointment ill, immediately start going list see get vaccine instead. 

It’s inappropriate somehow say “oops leftover vaccine, let call mom see wants it.” think going largely April regardless. forecasters predict less hundred deaths day end April....90% reduction. almost vulnerable 75+ age group comorbidities vaccinated, half country infected vaccinated, seasonal change warmer temperatures make virus less prevelent. antibodies mechanisms protect reinfection (e.g. Q concept literally loose plot movie. idea University exams like Japan.

Show physique basic protocol. could call next day appointments. open appointments others. Coming UK we've buttfucked strain past month I'd pay attention it. cases stable 50% increase infectivity potential explode pretty quickly nothing changes (as here). 8pm thing intended avoid people eating/drinking groups. Generally speaking getting train isn’t bad since everyone’s wearing masks; spending couple hours spraying saliva coworkers’ bare faces half dozen beers is. Yeah people praising university stupid. really saying okay meet lot people large groups long wear mask nose true. breakdown results bit vague (over 70s vs 70s, 70s worse), age tables study Unfortunately people realize ICU capacity based number beds available number doctors/nurses available. always add beds increase space patients always easy add staff look patients means getting less focused care ICU patient should.

Must bliss. actually think UK definitely open much sooner considering pace vaccination rollout. without doubt Asian economies roaring back they're able quell flare-ups using social distancing measures wait reach herd immunity threshold. 

I think main stumbling block US whole huge chunk population (and businesses) packed certain regions like California Tri-State area. areas can't roll shots effectively &amp; get infection rates they'll drag economy whole. vaccine type affect relationship number neutralizing antibodies need need stop virus. different way targeting proper rna fragment. ultimately similar thing adenovirus vector vaccines well Nova Max normal recombinant style vaccine. use different methods training body recognize react spike virus also dream. helps multiple companies manufacturing vaccines. many people worked hard last twelve months fight pandemic. posted response comment citing article, perhaps I’ll re-post sake bigger discussion.


The flu every season .... don’t die droves flu like from
Covid.

I think idea vaccines, viral mutations general, *some* lasting protection vaccines/previous infection. 

I’m virologist - case binding antibodies rendered useless every mutation .... wouldn’t viral diseases killed much higher rates novel viruses *also* killing rates today? 

Or vaccine provide *some* lasting protection? example - two boxers trained mentor, *similar identical* fighting styles, shouldn’t better chance boxer 2 learning fight boxer 1? even China's patient zero. 🤣 explanation could that?

State local mandates put place. follow states, find:

Politicians different matter, media never, ever misses opportunity tell us awful everything is.  didn’t say asymptomatic, said you’re showing symptoms. You’re still contagious show symptoms. fabric front nose, it’ll probably tickle sneeze. mention people symptoms go anyway nobody actually gives shit lives risk that. quote Fauci comes time short masks medical professionals needed save masks them. don’t, need stop spreading other, masks do. don’t keep GETTING it, keep GIVING it.

Edit: fixed typo Yeah, USA pretty respectably according this: good doses per capita suggests high overall number compared countries. Maybe I'm misreading tone seems like really using 'having mental health issues' insult people something agree irresponsible. calling someone 'mentally ill' exaggerated way saying they're wrong obstinate. disrespectful mentally ill, especially psychotic people promotes exactly kind mindset leads much stigma. Fucking coronavirus. Fuck 3 strikes would enough No, don’t. article:

Your line logic many people shouting numbers Covid deaths/issues exaggerated. They’re not. Doesn’t help either half population Overweight/Obese either reality California behind rest country getting infections catching up. next month pandemic rapidly end hope I'm Los Angeles cases 1,000,000+ cases California 3,000,000 cases. number states upper mid-west large recovery starting early December. Hospitalizations way down. widely reported, read much happened. genius know say we're rubes. bout health anxiety somewhat serious upsetting health issue it’s really hard shake. pissed doctors told might overthinking bodily sensations really [Eeeh bear sight, bear patrol must working like  dumb, poor guy chronic bronchitis, colds leave around 8 weeks lung issues, im definitely norm get called pmuch every single time. 
I think poster meant along lines ostrasized country it, generally still well accepted. 
And would say, different US sense.  Honestly, shocking fact Japanese exam proctors waited refusal #7 give boot. Oh cancel Mardi gras? Yea computer must slow day can't copy paste news articles. Sad. claim vaccines providing defense infection unknown mirrors claim early stages pandemic masks providing defense infection unknown. It’s strategic statement facilitate certain social behaviors.

Then, prevent run masks would’ve left healthcare workers cold.

Now, it’s prevent social chaos caused vaccinated unvaccinated portions society allowed two separate rule sets, revolt rules unvaccinated would likely engage due perception unfairness, allow businesses governments time build vaccine verification infrastructure.

“There’s data supporting yet” technically true statement works anything never study done it. There’s data supporting personally lower resting heart rate average person, since heart rate data never collected analyzed. Nevertheless, I’m entirely justified believing is, since I’m above-average competitive runner know endurance athlete cardiovascular systems general. Likewise vaccine, like vaccines general, provides immunity infection. Yes felt like fever whole day everytime temped 97 98 temped 99.8 day after. Masks like .30-.60 cents buy Costco bulk. think that's expensive. $15 $30 month wear exactly 2 masks day, opinion, wearing 1 fresh mask day enough. rest exchange;

I'm guessing one available end year they've moved everybody. first going little iffy though.  yep. real question percentage Americans vaccinated percentage Americans vaccinated gotten virus. Basically actually sped process getting herd immunity reopening many people getting virus last two months. US UK first two countries done scourge. UK likely done early March, US likely done early April. think pretty much back normal including removing masks memorial day. Back normal wearing masks Easter. whole ""boobies beads"" thing a...um...thing anymore?     Eh. Sorta. reality immunity likely drastically reduce transmission. don’t know much. It’s spectrum, here. yes, masks distancing people get shots get cases down. it’s better DayQuil, sure. Everybody, even doctor, believe really feeling horrible. hate going bed bad circulation breathing gets I'm prone Sounds like may respiratory issues? I’m sure I’m downvoted. look Ehlers Danlos syndrome. MCAS common comorbidity w/ EDS (and POTS matter). EDS also way common previously thought. doc (who one “experts” region) says prevalence thought 1:200 though it’s likely actually higher. could always taste outside air. goes really well chocolate. Pretty tasty eat chocolate inside step out. 

Not sure normal, makes foods interesting. officials say COVID-19 transmission worst Texas. 2,100 new deaths 136,000 new cases reported state past 7 days.

F! suspect level immunity become much milder thing. Probably worse bad cold / mild flu like illness like flu like illnesses got. worse time nobody immunity world. put completely new virus world nobody immunity happens. people get immunity even get reinfected much better ability fight big deal. Anybody saying “at pace...” trying stir resentment. Literally nobody things going pace going forward. Yah didn’t learn wear mask truly realize much help maybe first week pandemic March, week lockdowns. liberal taking sick time felt kind not-my-best. Sometimes meant missing work losing voice shouted much bar, better safe sorry! 

I also got let go day returning New Year week flu (not calling sick budget cuts) think compounding experiences lead hyper-diligent. 

“You wanna go bar spend money? I’m poor unemployed plus there’s pandemic anyways” 😂 mention time working getting bulk news real-time maaaaybeee overreacted even times, also, still haven’t caught 🤷🏻‍♀️ That's problem they're anticipating.

Anyway, denied vaccines per say, gov't seeing already. fully vaccinate (two shots) 25% population end Feb, even people 65.

According detailed serological survey estimated 76% population antibodies sars-cov-2 significantly limited probability medical system collapse happening now, according many experts.

It's closer apples apples would like. especially many vaccinations likely incomplete. Thanks clarifying distinction strain vs variant wear whole 8 hour shift want.

I personally prefer wear TWO masks per 8 hour shift comfortable way.

You people gross Go ahead. won't. I'll take cold two instead wearing mask Thanks. That’s much reasonable time. 6 top 29? 35 people 42,000 far. Cause death linked what’s research behind linked? many questions now. Yeah concern anaphylactic reactions. seems highly likely transmission stopped. know exactly much. preliminary evidence least somewhat encouraging care China one gutted US government made incapable even making delivering paper fucking masks. 3 weeks sales tax really much. worth piece limited vaccine pool Holy shit people delusional. lot measures going us years need prepare that. Yep. already. “$50,000k”

That’s $50,000,000, $50 million. little steep even Labron James. Unless died directly result vaccine (and article's silence speaks volumes), meaningless. Elderly people die often younger people, that's normal. Actually 40% US per capita (479 vs 1227 per million).

Still bad though, places taking seriously, applying bad policy Yuuuge Yeah, right...it's time buy new ones. They're really expensive. sit dashboard assume sunlight kills germs.

Companies lost sales period must able receive full compensation, ceiling SEK 75 million per company month.

#### Requires EU approval

The closure support shall apply period Pandemic Act force designed similar way so-called adjustment support, size turnover loss determines much support entitled to.

However, requires state aid approval European Commission. Therefore, take effect beginning April earliest. government decides closures then, support paid retroactively. Lol definitely anticipated it. Florida tourism state, state government wants bolster snowbird numbers, residency requirement  wear glasses wear surgical mask work day. get used fiddling bridge nose doesn’t fog glasses. fake news. Maybe previous problems I've had, personally can't use mask 2 days I'll trouble breathing due faint smell mold makes feel sick.

But yea probably acclimated smell mold even notice it.

But yeah, wearing mask whole week fucking disgusting. fuck would anybody masks easily available?? didn't, now. life over. return normal?  we'll Super Bowl, St. Patty's, Easter surges.

Would happy proven wrong tho. number one thing can’t wait for. Yeah, lets trust reddit science! think understanding all.

Most people get covid-19. least yet. u.s. close around 5% citizens confirmed it. evident infected tested it, youre assuming least 46% population gotten tested positive 

When account age comorbidities people covid-19 still seeing spikes hospitalizations long term health conditions compared would normally expected occur ages comorbidities without gad covid. 

While tet know long term consequences covid-19, frequent fact confirmed health concerns. also worry second order issues arise. many kids seeing parents struggle healthcare workers turning future? fibromyalgia sub numerous people join past 6 months saying covid fibro. :( dip new cases hospitalizations welcome sign U.S., continuing distribute COVID-19 vaccines risk disease. According to Bloomberg, U.S. distributed 14.3 million doses vaccine distributed average 898,000 shots day last week.
President-elect Joe Biden, takes office Wednesday, said wants deliver 100 million doses vaccine within first 100 days office. No, US vaccine quantity problem, issues lot states administering fast enough, large quantity vaccine thrown garbage Everyone freaking potential triage decisions hospitals question gets ventilator crisis. one thinking implications we're deciding gets vaccine. need consider young people - people children, 20 somethings starting lives - certainly die even though vaccine available would take offered, low prioity list receive state. odds low individual zero. keep watching 65 year olds freaking they'll get vaccine thinking, ""How feel 30 year old daughter dies leaves 3 year old without mother higher priority?"" 

I genuinely angry US handling vaccine rollout poorly Biden prioritize speeding timeline anything else first 100 days, lose faith. wish could disqualify idiot co-workers insist wearing masks noses. someone questions vaccines, they're called anti-vax, stop now? zero critical thinking lmfaoo  true absolutely fantastic!! said better could. gross, stay away lol Sounds like 2nd dose important. countries delaying skipping might penny wise pound foolish. free pass document allows person enter particular building without paying. japan enters us, without paying. that's un-American Y'all unreal Pretty sure post holiday cool down, guess time tell.

If correct, steadily decline here. I’m right, mellow bit uptick near (after) next big event (maybe Valentine’s Day). intelligence claim biomedical weapon Iraq. end day. neutral also. also serves politics Really slow day. 

You nothing better rant strangers bots Reddit? assume possibility worst. assume worst. prepare worst plan ready go worst happens good thing assume worst general. prepare plan know neutralizing antibody tighter need adapt vaccine quick stage two trial take weeks lock 2 months ready vaccinate again. ""I glad grand kids could get fucked party""

-grandma- uncomfortable fog obscure vision staring computer screen 7 hrs lol (which main concern, wear mask 8+ hrs clinic scribe at, use contacts instead never comfort issue. Contacts gives dry eye ideal test). looking dish soap since infer comments still transmit even getting vaccine I'm Israeli. prime minister says thing like ""quick, go vote , arabs voting me"", impossible get married Israel without going Rabbi, impossible get divorced Israel without going Rabbi.

We still things learn ""western"". think penalty. understand it, (legally binding) EU-wide procurement procedure finished free buy now. first people get vaccine trials got 6 months ago now. reason suspect need often. Hopefully even annually. slow due limited supplies, caution (save France, France always special case within Union). panicking, prolonged lockdowns disprove fact. hope don't. increase people cheating system get ahead line vaccines. Wealthy people traveling whole time. afford buy tests, take time work, isolate, also afford exploit loopholes getting vaccine sooner. California peak January 27th hospitalizations peak first week February. I’m Sacramento numbers different L.A. county. plus big difference getting dinner 5 friends going concert 1000+ people. going happen 100% preventing hospitalisations though even chance misspell name COVID much transmissible 

Source?  half second dose? 100% American. else arrogant enough try instruct others allowed allowed bring discussion. Honestly we're annoying sometimes. totally get it. doubts. people majority. Eventually would give up. There'd lot jobs opening health care try grow system keep up. Lots people would die. Eventually would burn mutate significantly (who knows way) due natural immunity. understand it, way virus could continue spread vaccinated otherwise immune person could get trapped mucous membranes immune system would fight could shed spread somehow. saying?

There fair number people side argument. vaccinated probably carriers, contagious: conclusion interim results study Sheba Hospital.

And “If vaccine that’s 95 percent effective reducing symptoms, universe wouldn’t also reduce likelihood transmission. It’s possible,” said. “So we’re talking whether reduces transmission not, want get extent much.”


I guess say specifically tested know. think stretch say vaccine 95% effective provides reduction spread. Devastating Problem.
Always Assume Worst Case Scenario - treat unknown threats. one piece huge puzzle comes handling pandemic. know know this, I've seen around long time. suggest ""got us here"" nonsense. number vaccine-hesitant people drop vaccinations proceed. simply need novelty mRNA vaccines wear off. ease getting mental health help Canada varies extremely depending province even city in. first thing mental health system tries medication already failed. Ehhhh, that’s technically true cheating metropolitan areas stretch far beyond literal city boundaries. enough everyone. Keep mind around 20% get vaccine right away also people 16 able get vaccinated. Germany would actually mean 62,5% population vaccinated year. Easily achievable. like UK mutation ""May"" contagious. I'm convinced 2020 beginning end race.  It’s patriarchal Asian society. Go look China Korea. It’s same. Asian societies don’t value individualism individual rights like west. You’re gonna hard pressed find Asian country lgbt people treated well.  “Only” lol. That’s pretty damn good regardless two right now. already cancelled Mardi Gras? aware that's good news. That's one possibility. Another possibility virus triggers type autoimmune response continues even virus eliminated. read article?

Discharged covid patients readmitted hospital within 5 months 3.5x higher rate compared non covid patients 

almost 8x many past covid patients died within 5 months post discharge non covid patients 

Discharged Covid patients also showed higher signs heart, respiratory lung issues compared non covid patients well 

There also poor results never admitted hospital 5 month mark well masks arguably visual symbol entire thing. mention able see people's facial expressions drive people insane. way hope that, future, person feels sick coughing day, they'll wear mask go outside, past year made Americans really, really hate face coverings, really think hard understand why. True, US advantage UK Asia almost 30% population already infected discussion anything *American* website invariably tied to... wait it... *America*. Obviously shocking you. sure why. Oh wait, intentionally obtuse. That's right. covid, quaratine period basically immune? e.g. went go see friend sick 6 weeks ago would fine possible still carry gotten reinfected? Thought ""immune"" like 3 months. getting downvoted? You’ve vaccinated... shouldn’t even wear mask. It’s respectful enough you’re partly wearing it. sounds little awkward enforce. gonna do, carry around certificate vaccination everywhere prove exempt? would support large gatherings, maybe without masks social distancing, vaccinated people allowed attend. anyways caught back October. asked got non-serious answers. would happen able create vaccines Covid? don’t think understand culture works regard mental health. He’s basically already dead won’t getting help now. may magic bullet back normalcy everyone vaccinated infected naturally.

Huh? Haven’t heard anyone say suspect herd immunity threshold 100%. don’t need “everyone” vaccinated infected normalcy happen, even close.


Separately, considering seems like presymptomatic transmission happens significant degree, purely asymptomatic seem happen significant degree— don’t see vaccine that’s 95% effective preventing symptoms wouldn’t majorly reduce transmission. think hospital capacity. enough people get vaccinated hospital capacity becomes manageable, go back relatively normal. Different states definitions 'manageable hospital capacity' 'relatively normal'. Since fans left city took Covid germs hometowns. Georgia full loyal (and ignorant) ‘Bama die hards. Yeah, I've following Indiana numbers daily can't tell exact daily numbers, remember couple weeks ago seeing cases 6000s. Last week 3000s. Yesterday's numbers dropped 3000 (probably due usual Sunday decrease). 

For record, many restrictions. think restaurants forced remain closed anywhere state. 50% reduction capacity. think issue would soon CDC says okay vaccinated people stop wearing masks, millions, millions unvaccinated people stop wearing altogether. get challenged that, they'll say got vaccinated. they're young, they'll say work healthcare. We're around 15,000,000 vaccinated people point, idea kind ""vaccine passport"" pretty unrealistic point, Walmart employee telling people wear masks, idea who's vaccinated going call police verify every claim.

I'd okay public statement vaccinated individuals need wear masks evidence backs up, sadly consider consequences statement. consequence *some* people *need* wear masks, *most* people going *stop* wearing masks. Believe I'd love stop wearing mask, I'm really hoping mask free Summer, think anyone going permitted go stores gyms whatever without mask deaths hospital burden low safe everyone stop, probably happen least couple months. Hopefully we're hundred million people initiating vaccination, rate would March, we'll good enough condition end restrictions, think public health officials feel we're position right now. Supply pretty much depends approval AstraZeneca Johnson Johnson vaccines. former receive approval 29 January. J&amp;J, see Phase 3 data say. sounds like start anime. Instead getting hit bus killed transported fantasy world forgets mask life over. Reading comprehension hard days, thats person said all. Yes also single user deliver groceries interacting safe gets.  heard ridiculous things this. Eu plans allow 3rd nationals citizens vaccinated vaccines approved EU. People able choose vaccine gonna get. person gets sinovac example, mean he/she allowed enter EU? Stop punishing right thing. Start punishing people causing problems. sympathetic both. idea government would rather open economy instead closing refuse provide financial support citizens businesses sickening. peoples attempts coup brag stream Facebook. surprised would put Biden may true, he’s gone beating COVID first 100 days. It’s incredibly risky successful he’ll rewarded. he’s not, 2022 rough Democrats. mean, there's lot people indoors really super safe, even everyone wearing masks distancing properly. went one bit ago, like 10 people direct family. 

Try convince keep small brief, live stream available. That's gets you? distancing cancelled events? make sure it’s actually leaded solder 😬 Also one lease diverse states (I looked, actually bad thought, Wikipedia 86% white 2010). Hopefully, recalled. That's article appears indicate. seen original study, know cohort patients studied readmitted due repeat COVID infection. article mention any, mean occur. intriguing good news, Biden hint that? Good health achieved lifestyle choices primarily control. Monoclonal antibodies one spot spike. mutations could make work.

Indeed, many people continue least one COVID symptom month testing (\~40%). 30 days, however, experienced COVID fewer 5 symptoms 15% likely still experience symptoms likely experience COVID-like symptoms control groups 90 days.

However, people severe COVID, \~40% experienced symptoms least 90 days. 10 percentage points higher control group experienced least five COVID symptoms tested negative.

Every day see new videos dumb asses dancing weddings without social distancing masks. cities/neighborhoods edging 50% infection government/police absolutely nothing elections weeks (again) knuckleheads Bibi’s closest coalition partners. black white portraying that's disingenuous. sides done fucked things. would take 1.4m per day 90 days. Biden goal 100 million 100 days. 125 million virus probably vaccine. virus seems give people roughly 95% immunity symptomatically infection beginning pandemic lot work places required negative come isolation people knew could test positive months. far i’m aware state’s dept health never required negative come isolation. ...you aware, course, nearly every country planet put place stringent mandates US, correct?

I don’t know bubble you’re referring to, unless you’re talking one explicitly refused take significant measures end crisis. 

I didn’t answer questions you’re utterly deflecting fact you’ve made multiple entirely unscientific inaccurate claims suit degenerate political inclinations.

And, yes, absolutely team medical experts hand. work public health lmao  Yea Europe, work out? end being? heart tests done before? symptoms? I’m super fast heart rate covid &amp; im tests I’m terrified happening. going happen unless NZ Australia go full North Korea forever. already autoimmune disease COVID causes brain fog honestly can't really tell difference. First 30 minutes vaccination people must stay vaccination site.So easy get data.Afterwards update App,not sure people enter minor headache details. glad found way help treat it! Good luck, stay healthy :)  forget stay hydrated. helps reduce overall inflammation Better start carbo loading now. get fettuccine alfredo? wealthy countries ordered several times amount need. Whilst also want pay medical staff vaccinations poor countries. Red Cross &amp; Médecins Sans Frontières would use excess vaccine.

Also wealthy countries really want get economy back order can't half world still infected. metric FL need lockdown currently states? roughly middle pack cases per capita, cases trending down, hospitizalations plateaued. “Quite studies long term effect”

*virus around single year...*

Okie dokie artichokie! Yeah. ""fatigue"" ""aches pains,"" sort vague symptoms hypochondriac middle aged blobs paying doctors treat ""microfybrialgia"" years Could possible actual virus drops point it’s still causing havoc body cannot detected. causes much instability certain things start failing certain period time unaware domino effect virus set off. take it? let slip... Like everyone else saying, Japan may covid control better us. also they're extremely inflexible culture. Companies want let people work home, everyone commuting work like normal. surprisingly they're unwilling change way test students.  Source? LA following level strict regulations Ohio? 1. probably mitigates due asymptomatic transmission rare, people's bodies expelling quickly - case, that's besides point, 80% population vaccinated (and nearly 100% older/risk groups) matter spreads primarily vaccinated people?

2. logic Australia do... what? Never come semi-lockdown mode ever?

3. They're 90% pretty damn good. agree. Imagine war foreign entity allowed use new super fighter jet authorities sure every bolt ISO certified.

The EU EU regulatory boards joke sometimes. honestly defend time. don’t get.

This typical pharmaceutical study long results good (and - Astra Zenecas vaccine better flu vaccine market, mention amazing mRNA stuff) GMP rules Annex1 fulfilled: it. Makes sense. Texas huge number cases. I’m glad ok. words- well actually do. Amen don’t live state full stupid people. States like Texas Florida basically promoting death allowing type thing. Concert? people selfish? Throw jail, nobody concert right indoor outdoor That's we'd know positive! refused wear properly asked seven times pull mask nose... learned within minutes starting wear masks (back march) still tell people almost daily wondering never adjusted glasses whole time. 

If somethings working try fix it; unless hot air directed lens guess. software universities use lock test screen can’t use another browser open another tab. it’s silly waste time use phone second computer open lmao Always one y’all every thread Oh shit, forgot whole year. Holy fuck. 

Yeah getting better running, bad past summer fall I've hammering away since. running program never changed got way took like 6 weeks sick, worst symptoms couple weeks lingering effects longer energy breath easily. people telling dangers pain meds addictions. good advice - even better advice need get better. I’d like say entire family got COVID know thing two. helped recover advised need. want get better need take exercise slow - that’s jogging primarily light walking - occasional warm compound exercise. 

You also start taking assortment vitamins antioxidants. 

That includes vitamin C ( vitamin even though it’s something would likely low beginning infection ). B12 - need mitochondria get back shape - best way replenish vital compound I’m willing bet low point. Hydration water can’t stressed enough, I’d like add consuming progressively increasing amount antioxidants. Personally provided pomegranate juice red onions asparagus. chosen due immense anti-inflammatory oxidative stress reducing properties, words give lungs heart break give time heal effectively. 

I’d also invest pulse oxymeter track progress- blood o2 ever issue. want 95-100, however varies. Things work virus. main thing timing priming immune system. recommended family take medications unless absolutely needed. reason? Synthetic medications often put extra load liver - even they’re working. 

Lastly - may sound dumb. try. therapy. Yes ....nitrous oxide therapy. entails using breathing exercises strengthen vasculature. 

I’m doctor - study biotechnology, terms understanding inner working virus things help. I’m open questions. I’ve enough experience, unfortunately. keeping chin - too. grocery store supervisor, think again. confront people lack mask whenever see them. won’t offended people would rather shop somewhere else, take offense people building deciding rules don’t apply disagree it. too... pick soon Biden office countries speeding vaccination process. Also, AZ J&amp;J yet approved, even EUA. Both, especially J&amp;J, speed process massively due less logistical issues transportation storage, plus J&amp;J one dose, done local pharmacy easily. Yeah feeling. Many people survey think things ever go back normal work department health. correct. 

However quarantine 14 days starting boyfriend’s isolation period ain’t pot called kettle black..... almost rich countries spent hundreds billions dollars develop vaccine. odd.
Why pitch 150 countries come vaccine? much something wrong said. Life go normal. 

You wring hands variants want. There’s thousands discovered I’m sure thousands more. Excuse don’t work tizzy every time media decides needs new fear target generate ad revenue. What's point country vaccinated? Obviously, highly doubt I'd even able get one. curious. Lol, you’re delusional Inshalla Palestine rejected earlier offer Israel said going purchase vaccine own. concern delivery schedule, understand mRNA vaccines requiring refrigiration, let's talk vaccines (J&amp;J example) many countries willing pay vaccines getting precedence they're sold year.

If country already enough doses vaccinate 50% population ( projecting here), ethical prioritize rest doses countries received 0 doses , talking charity here. 3 stages

hahahahahahahahahaha sure, let's expect average western country abide that. I'm getting really tried urban legend people dying car accidents counting covid death. hear many people, even better, say happened someone town. one ever provides evidence exact report like April single incident may happened. really trust Pompeo, trust US intelligence services. hope new administration follow this. facts claimed ""fact sheet"" indeed true, seems really suspicious. Europe UK done late summer early fall. Uk done late March/early April. really hope breathing problems get better. sounds scary! parent? parents 40 know brain cells barely let kids play things anymore honest. know disease factories balls covered kid spit piss. Sorry, worded poorly. mean I'm low risk group (under 40, pre-existing health conditions relatively fit).  Post-viral syndrome rare condition sometimes happen post infection. That’s true COVID-19 viral illnesses. people say “longCOVID” keep hearing describe somatic issues generally caused anxiety depression, given state things, highly plausible. Yes. 1/3 people hospitalized. worry, say that's masks, lockdowns vaccine think find many people going abide that. wouldnt say so. isnt great also isnt absolute disaster. countries like Denmark really solid numbers given fast enough vaccine rollout EU.  Thanks, work high school Japan though 😉 Also July 4 surge significant, probably due increased vigilance hot weather/outdoor activities. still know people infected time, really significant spreading event.  That's insidious virus. everyone learns lesson takes seriously someone know gets hard time also people get mild case know people mild case reinforces opinion must big deal. *highly infectious varients enter chat* got first dose Moderna friday. Havent got 2nd dose yet. still contract Covid got first dose only? coworker mine might contracted covid recently I'm wondering. Fair enough I'll honest here, never thought would many deaths coronavirus short period time backlog cremations would create air quality problem. expect we're going start seeing pile-on effects like time.

Edit: rereading makes sound like backlog that's problem. That's I'm trying say. Soooo forfeit salary sit season??? get confused. Many argue 400k maybe 500k sometime March isn’t big deal. dead oldest society, death inevitable part life. 500k US, say 10+ million world time thing statistically insignificant. Maybe right. However, takes human element process. Following though pattern many could die “not big deal”?

Right roughly 8 billion people planet. virus could wipe 4 BILLION people would still 4 billion left. estimated world pop 1.6 billion 1900. could lose half people still twice much population 120 years ago. course 4 billion people died would expect society breakdown due fear panic society would rebuild move 4 billion. far take “not big deal” stance. become big deal? appropriate response COVID? fucking infuriating. hope workers getting much abuse though, fault, abysmal rollout's fault. wanna see live music pretty much anything world. refuse support notion masks ""here stay"" mass gatherings. love get drunk talk random people fans stuff like. Masks nuisance that, major one, enough sour experience. ultimately country opened low cases deaths, non compliance lawsuits. 


If described happens, shocked all, they've moving goalposts whole time. soon risk vaccinated widely available general population, anyone continues comply delaying return normalcy 7M people nothing better do... things stayed way Trump, I’m guessing general population would getting first dose like July August. 

If Biden manages streamline process pick pace, maybe May vaccination general population begin. Lol true colours eh. favour, look reddit look around room, little think life. Enjoy sure thing. thanks explanation. personally believe clinical evidence almost dietary lifestyle changes would satisfy qualifiers least COVID, strong evidence diseases similar nature gym posting I’m suspicious well Ha...but U.K. saying maybe fall.  Fun stuff. 98% Western. Suck mother They’re considered expendable expendable. know many high school athletes would love play college sports? half college students want you’re doing, don’t expect treated like kings. agree college sports might lose enjoyment sports normally being, that’s exploitation. Why? one forced that. 

I don’t see anything wrong universities expecting lot student athletes saying “if don’t want that, we’ll find someone else”. lab sending 50 week checked. We're NYS. Yeah, think takes good organization leadership level get things done (that political leadership). 

Most bureaucracies involved leaders wanted run show, want commit anything least bit pushing envelope. words, wanted take credit without risk. end result lot talking slow progress. Yet CA still 49th place terms vaccine received distributed, whatever policy total failure It’s semantics game gotcha. That’s is. 
Politicians always first politicians. Actually he's chemical engineer root cause analysis specialist. absolutely dietician nutritionist. root cause analysis research heart disease chronic conditions lecturing regard diet. he's actually engineer. still aligned politically, ""not one crazies""? states main issue Trump’s stubborn refusal invoke DPA. One word could completely shut car production force car factories start producing vaccine freezers.  okay, breathe. extremely unlikely vaccine ineffective strain. worst realistic outcomes either 1) vaccines less effective still work (maybe 95% 65%) 2) leads new strain line escapes vaccine thoroughly.

By point resistance COVID due vaccination (even incomplete) slow things enough update vaccine. Going Work, getting supplies like food home. Seems pretty obvious me. Absolutely, explained better. We're long way away herd immunity vaccinations and/or infections. right human beings conscience. 

What right *not* help help themselves. 

If culture advocated murder people brown hair, would wave hands say, ""who judge?""

You're intellectually lazy dishonest disgust me. dont think know term seeing light end tunnel means. tunnel end pandemic, seeing end tunnel knowing end, seeing light end means know getting close end there. Ah new hotness. Whitmer suggested it’s uncool left out. 
Starting Thursday it’s going bukkake party Democrats.   doubt would hard-core it, envisioning masks/temperature checks door like. get wrong, *want* put that, temporarily required able see live bands ballgame two again... What... Chinese Communist government ordered citizens lie something... Inconceivable! uhh, Yes? Months, rather weeks.

Other Pfizer, vaccines interval 3 weeks prime booster shots. majority intervals 2 months more. Maybe, 

I really hope it’s last huge surge experience, yet get handle role new variants might play next month so. It’ll interesting see mixture immunity recent infections, vaccine rollout, well changing weather coming together time.  Things might looking up, heck wants catch bullet last days war? What’s going happen get end Biden’s “100 Days Masking” Fauci et al. still say need mask distance even you’ve vaccinated point. Biden say begin focusing societal normalization? get “Another 100 Days Masking” widespread anger despair?

Seems like latter option recipe low approval rating 6 month mark first term. Correct I’m wrong graph shows projection cases fall close nothing starting February, currently happening agree! makes roll frustrating me. Well, countries ""apocalyptically poor performance"". US - media government - usually presents worldeader, best nation, completely exceptional everyone else, failed response definitely noteworthy. Especialy since US much resources available combat pandemic small countries like Czech Republic Belgium. Finally, lot failed-Corona-response articles countries Guardian too, like Guardian anything positive say Britain's Covid-19 response. Ivor Cummins fucking dietician loon. Science proves wrong, unfortunately. 

Deal it. Yea thought worked 9 day row shifts 12 hrs each. Yea lets go ahead PAUSE fucking vaccine distribution 10 people allergic reactions. makes total sense right. Gotta admit, I'm bit wary Colorado Fitness Coalition telling us gyms safe. 


The metrics reported seem relevant: ""In study, OCG discovered correlation COVID-19 case rates gym attendance.""

I think statement means anything all.  That's oversimplification. concern immunity **less effective**, totally ineffective.

This surprising. Viruses mutate, do. vaccinate world, creating massive evolutionary pressure virus mutate escape immunity further. That's expected bad sounds... means update vaccines cover multiple strains.

We probably need get revaccinated every like flu. mean we'll ""pandemic pandemonium"" forever. Well, there's reason nobody even really done anything preliminary tests children... big reason affected it, especially compared older adults.

They eventually get anyone attempt stamp Covid much possible get far herd immunity possibly can.  think single biggest fuckup initially pushed idea non-N95 masks anything. fringe, conspiracy nonsense *official health guidelines*. disagree. main issue keep closest us safe (especially immunocompromised elderly) given severity disease. everyone wants vaccine’s chance get it, majority populous vaccinated, it’s good old Darwinism. Anti-vaxx continue get covid, giving elderly relatives (if also anti-vax) watch die, either wake effectiveness vaccines join club don’t continue killing closest them. rest us safe, let Darwin thing.

He's going job soon enough. California go Republican like Arnold nothing says good reputation like inviting tourists century pandemic. people better Big Tobacco.  Yah it’s shitty ass system gives land votes people order protect slave owners. democrats popular vote every election bar one last 20 years.

Seriously. earth California's Health Department thinking? get charged trespassing. sure you’re thinking ignore person call cops don’t listen tell leave. oh that's good news Lmao I’m guessing also don’t ride cars, seeing millions get injured even die accidents estimate around 35-40% US population (~125 million) infected SARS-CoV-2 virus end 2021. additional 60 million infections since mid-December 2020.

I'm sad I'm guessing epic saga spreading coronavirus.

Cool idea! Let's try Way ... ... Infected Nothin ... Prevent Infection, Wash Hands, Wear Mask, Watch Distance

yep, check out!  O:-) can. definitely wait see much country collapses next 10 years. Vertigo Covid?? remember getting horrible vertigo June... ENT doctor said allergies told get nasal spray, worked, still... [You see data statistics funeral bird.   authorities Victoria state reported nine infections among passengers arrived charter flights Feb. 8-21 Australian Open officials said cases may come light testing continues.

Yet 9 people sick 72 lockdown. southern hemisphere technically, Costa Rica open. need proof travel health insurance, least requirement December. work better ended quarantined month slowly traveled house, resetting 14 day window every day. stupid idea tennis tournament Australia middle pandemic country that's done outstanding job. probably cases virus among athletes entire rest country Australia. important vaccine adminstration taking days off. It'd nice data really care long adminstration continuing weekends holidays. not. joke, leadership urgency issue. Exactly! institution failed plan doses accordingly none would wasted. doeses left end day. making adjustments plans incorporate recipients per day. knew someone would write scummy blame-filled headline completely reasonable request *helps us*. Gotta get outrage clicks, guess. remaining 5%. sounds like recover, that's awesome. above, more. 
On serious note, probably Indonesian that’s due proximity. 

I agree lot wrote, matter, truth govt can’t move faster it’s citizens. significant constituents pushing changes. I’m even sure classify foreign labor issue, local workers similarly lowly paid harshly treated. “mild age group”

The quotes imply sarcasm false narrative, objectively true statement. Quotes needed.  problem 3 million doses vaccine available moment. Found pretty good source 75 seriously ill. mean think look things, it’s pretty sad people already Facebook Twitter using evidence vaccines. countries made mistakes could’ve done things better

InfectionFest 2021. it. wait it? Yeh, great. hate governor, he's done really good things Covid. Unfortunately fucked everything middle. ""Kind like flu""

You mean disease like 50% people get vaccinated whose vaccinations contributed mightily gotten twice. recovered people side effects like clotting, cardiac arrest, ailments require medical attention happening large scale would impossible impact healthcare system. We're seeing studies showing aide effects rare.

Likely manageable effects numbers mean count level impact. Getting tested couple hours boss came work tested positive 2 days later ive quite symptoms masinly taste distortion. ate ranch could taste vinegar!!! important issue even holding exams person? politician mean often fall party lines. redneck friends pretty hard Rs wear masks bother precautions. get it, shock I'd little-to-no sympathy. friends take lot precautions, especially protect older family members. got it, would full sympathy. And, 'shockingly', people know taking serious heavily left leaning. 

And can't say anecdotal, since there's plenty data across board supports observation general.

It technically nothing left/right D/R, HEAVY correlation different spectrums follow science ignore common decency name 'freedom'. reason watch video covid cases time (per capita) sort high low state, almost every state top 20 red nearly every state bottom blue. try track video know I'm talking seen it. fascinating watch numbers rise. Zeke fell he's washed he's overused. Ok, normalized per capita basis, get? what's source there? There's coming back start. really isn't.

Moves beginning matter immensely.

Even aside political polarization, sheer numbers impossible Biden peel back. prevalence low random mass testing give way false positives true positives.

Seems like clinicians could offer probabilities use judgment. Yeah, poor guy. never seemed fully recover first big concussion (and ones came didn’t help matters). Still legend, hopefully live healthier without constantly push play elite level. People looking virus came reaction it. China, wherever starts outbreak build massive hospital week. still know next nothing virus works body. know released research lab. ones know modifying bet virus naturally occurring modified somehow CRISPR/Cas-9. I’d like say “stop lies” know doesn’t matter YouTube medical degree. guess I’m going look positive here, don’t want vaccine that’s ok cause makes move one spot line mine. Totally agree, I'm sure focus put patient care part it, understand doctor lose seeing X number patients day, high-stress environment, years. It'd better change messaging least deliver even know, frustrating, understand happens well. Totally. I’m trying get bed stretch little bit every day relieve achy joints. Definitely wouldn’t work sweat right now! Answer questions try kill anyone process every nation mass-vaccinations moment.

Why would lockdowns majority population vaccinated? I'm optimistic enough believe hope. improved quite bit first became sick. sucks I'm back normal yet know time I'll eventually get there. barely breath

I call BS, sensationalizing.  vaccine wasn’t thing, I’d agree them. lot frontline workers it’s numbers game try keep safe long possible normalise fact Florida much older California. bro. Oh that's way better title implied. Gave damn heart attack (even though well 140 days since recovered). time UK put restrictions virus everywhere. absolutely large component luck. able convince otherwise. Look Canada... good job still spreading pretty crazily right now. Tory virus quite variant sure. barely leave house. sickest ever Nov 2019 strangely seemed like covid knew was. last summer exactly horrible 2 week illness bedridden. time lost sense taste getting random headaches. know America, there's advice deal police e.g. knock door? advice volunteer information throw open doors. demand see warrant. 

Only naive person would advise black guy let cops ""if innocent, nothing hide"". 

It's kind like China. nothing gain plenty lose letting outsiders investigate. they've let many conditions surely purpose would say later cooperated nothing incriminating found.  Chicago really locked right now. mask checkpoints every single entrance way, especially Target. Nobody gets store without mask on. Otherwise, police gonna get called gonna arrested.

Unsurprisingly online shopping extremely popular right now; drive around suburbs see tons signs saying ""Leave groceries right here"" porches, doors, etc. Runners training 60 miles week two months race, doubled odds sickness compared training less 20 miles week Laboratory research shows athletes exercising high intensity 90 minutes experience steep drop immune function last 24 hours. drop immune function appears caused elevation stress hormones released following heavy exertion. exercise immunologists believe allows viruses already body spread gain foothold. big difference safety think although measles vaccine also quite safe. sense significantly safer we'll see. surprised Novavax 97 98% efficacy rate Meanwhile Texas walk stores without mask. time President Trump sometimes mocking people wore masks

Basically, Trump. Considering young people final people get vaccinated children people natural immunity COVID, definitely low priority list.  luck...PRO ACTIVE vs. ACTIVE go hospital you’re a...? CDC says 97% efficacy measles two doses MMR

Not really sure vaccine could significant long shot better that.

I'm discussing safety here, That’s weird, know somebody mild symptoms waited negative test go outside again. covid doesn’t treat everybody equally additional vaccines well general public - i.e. non elderly, non healthcare worker spring. Moderna &amp; Pfizer deliver enough 100 million Americans first quarter - J&amp;J see 60 million doses April? know AZ. Pfizer also continue delivering another 100 million doses July know Moderna ship unsure much.... That's lot vaccines..... need 3 million first doses per day norm 4 approved vaccines. think US thing western thing anti maskers - ain't seen asians anti mask demonstrations, whilst Europe fair share nobs. mean, university professor said would probably take team day process data large-scale study. Further, FDA surely access ongoing trial data.

I guess doesnt really matter seems like run vaccine supplies never actually administer people besides hospital staff. Looking timeline article, new variant identified end November, existence September discovered going back looking old data. government could responded weeks quicker, three months quicker. hidden, would regularly uploading data open databases. main UK government failure increasing national restrictions despite genomic increasing case number data mid December, Christmas.

Although variant must emerged August/September, discovery timeline is:

Late November, new variant changes genome potentially causing increased transmission immunity evasion identified.

8th Dec, genomicists group concludes likely variant causing rising cases Kent.

11th Dec, government scientific advisory group concludes variant likely need stricter restrictions control prime minister notified.

14th Dec, notified new covid variant UK government. also think Australia got lucky cases initial restrictions hit. case similar Britain unmitigated spread likely several months would late. understand shame would virus mutated country country saying ""hey problem"".

This happened UK variant.

Notice firmly ""UK variant"". real sense blame serious practical consequences. government kept quiet let another country discover it, might evaded.

This attempt defense, course--obviously approach front communication morally correct necessry, actions Chinese government took cover led unimaginable damage suffering.

But everyone point finger comes something like really sufficient motive, especially power largely rooted control image information. could definitely see reason without add anything exciting. sure happen? When? It’s absurd suggest say certain lockdowns it’s highly unlikely. ruler like parent. Sometimes got things logic. Sometimes it’s calm public create fairness. covid late February zero symptoms since. scary though :( never said slavery. said athletes exploited discarded longer matter school. Clearly much larger percentage think. lived saw happen many. positive memories friendships I’m sure worth many others. many people died Los Angeles County officials temporarily suspended air-quality regulations limit number cremations.

That's fucking insane. That’s insane. month two might pretty much Israel. Maybe good. Easiest part test failed it. Australia policy going zero (except maybe Western Australia), happy accident taking measures seriously. others already pointed they're already covered. Additionally yes, disagree refugees, accepted country following policies treated differently. less worthy born here. U.S. recognize accept refugees integral part culture, history morals. Refugees Americans they're brought country granted resources. article, ""There's much that's good bodies,"" said Brook-lyn Parker, 28, cosmetologist Watertown, New York, said would never take shot. ""For me, natural immunization better way go far COVID goes, kind like flu."" evidence, noted never gotten flu vaccine caught flu twice.

.... can't nice things GP = general population?

The general population large. last get vaccinated. people are. get may continue wearing mask. 

If we're lucky, virus transmit vaccination wear mask much longer... Ridiculous. vaccine trash instead body, that's incorrect. vaccine trash less protect elderly even vaccine young person virtually never leaves house goes school online. 19yo friend lived since last March. It’s hard mostly home online college lots isolation. friend dating hardly home. travel work gone week. noticed daughters emotional changes month ago, sleeping all, becoming afraid leaving house etc etc saw wasn’t getting better ( even meds therapist zoom calls year) got dog. big 3 month old Great Dane puppy. know cons; shit agonized awhile, end knew would help her. didn’t want worry gone thinking suicidal stuff. pet provide emotional stability responsibility people. know it’s choice people make think it’s going work her. much pain time, would recommend trying kratom instead prescription painkiller. It’s herbal painkiller I’ve used recreationally, really work manage pain. non-toxic cannot overdose die it. Slightly addictive anywhere near addictive actual painkillers. Give thought need continue managing pain oh mean like post viral chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS/ME), worry really exist. Trust Ive checked. good doctor tell head. try exercise yoga. 
/s Howwww ? absolutely nothing japan article prevalence low random mass testing give way false positives true positives. less need limit testing exposure. wonder properly released medical standpoint hostpital kick due lack space. first one indicate relapse second one overfilled hostpitals. Well best vaccine ever made significant long shot terms efficacy especially safety states restrictions, soon lifted, country isn’t indefinite lockdown. look NZ - lockdown six months. Vietnam - lockdown six months. Australia countries don’t open up, don’t think guy reddit comments convince otherwise. empty sports stadiums, empty theaters, empty schools, empty parks, empty restaurants, encouraging people scale back birthday parties, weddings, holidays, visiting loved ones hospital. 

power 2020 activities 2019. rest us stayed covid-free made adjustments. Last week would’ve close comfort week think fine long tested negative week ago. haven’t visited anybody months. think necessarily done maliciously. thousands Covid-19 strains, hindsight one easily single particular one. would cost us least 5x pay nursing home take care home. can’t afford that, would could. exhausted *every* route put home. everyone nursing home dumped one wants take care them, sometime options. sit say *we’re* selfish put home don’t know full story really messed up. trying defend people going partying every night *pandemic* (they post Facebook Snapchat) go work next day care vulnerable people knowing haven’t seen families almost year could *die* without seeing don’t get paid enough?? morality?? simply don’t get paid enough allowed take chances people’s life?? agree get paid more, *definitely* don’t agree get “pass” don’t. Yes! see coworkers getting promoted, etc. WFH kids daycare, remind sacrifice making promotion. year stressful end day piece mind much possible, within reason, keep family safe. thanks much balanced perspective. Aunt sorts chronic issues growing up. thought odd lazy, needed toughen push it.

Around 10 years ago age 26 started increasingly fatigue - thought getting ""old"" ha :) Doctor went said need learn live - really bad sickness incredibly fatigued 24/7. walk 10 feet without wiping out. Took 1.5 years get back mostly normal, since then, I'd go periods fatigue month week so. 

Finally got label ""chronic reactive ebv"" two separate doctors (1 integrative 1 functional) - realize everyone agrees it. tried help address referenced,focusing stress levels, sleeping, fitness, diet - normal things standard ""healthy"" living, along supplements. things made difference.

Not sure exactly causes it, sister similar symptoms, least seems like something genetically influenced.

Wish doctors least approach. PA friend mine thinks mental.

That incredibly frustrating diagnosis someone experienced something similar, writes off. understand though, similar thoughts Aunt younger.

Long story short, thank open minded realizing large number people things making up, even know concretely issues yet. here. several board games, video games, lawn toys. person goes around others husband, work grocery store. That’s it. Thankfully, received first round vaccine recently. It'd disappointing least double IMO. phizer moderna meet thier commitments supply need 2M doses day keep supply without even accounting JnJ others. FDA previously noted side effects Moderna vaccine trial participants cosmetic facial fillers cheeks lips.

This may problem Southern California... got Pfizer vaccine 4 days ago. London here. Children extremely low death rate COVID. get immunity infection. good job dude. that's ton cycling, outdoor apt/house? I'm thinking getting indoor bicycle questions lol. never autoban people posted subs. multiple mods feel strongly this.

The problem many people care anymore except people either think coronavirus scam think coronavirus end world. spring ratio people appropriate response pandemic drowned people. ratio dropped lot obvious. obviously can't make people interested covid again. Honestly hope like 5 months mostly vaccine nobody cares sub anymore.  Yet somehow countries still managed much better have. Gonna take “clean” White House reputation though.

In US, yes, effective, largely opened quickly high baseline cases. US would executed properly, total deaths would much lower now.  lost taste/smell four five days. Today first day fever free since 12/28. I've thankful mild case seeing this. STEM degrees parents scream cry important kids go physically school play sports full activities absolutely livid find kid can't play college sports, heart damage limits life activities, maybe even lifespan limiting complications. Don’t get wrong appreciate work put in.

The problem me, least spring/summer, regarded high quality place get information sound intellectual discussions others realized seriousness pandemic, didn’t deal guys parrot talking points crawling place spreading bad takes misinformation.

I get can’t filter all, correct wrong isn’t way auto-ban users active certain subs? Couldn’t something like implemented here? (I think know ones talking about, can’t name due filters) family thinks I’m ridiculous scared paranoid stupid liberal catch get since probably won’t die. sucks dislike going home ever combination luck hard work haven’t caught far got who’s stupid one? curious: notice leading POTS diagnosis? also vEDS? don’t know India news media, really? trust US media transparent controlled stockholders companies?  That’s source, assumptions projections. linked actual data comment mine replied sourced data CDC NHS. sure you’re hell bent proving random people US par UK vaccination rollout, it’s not. Hm, sounds eerily similar arguments COVID deniers make. Great answer makes total sense I've read. One question. Many vaccines 100% effective, obviously. peoples immune systems able cope virus even vaccine? know immune systems weaken age, lifestyle, chronic conditions etc. reasonable think even vaccine response immune system enough help them? 

I'm UK. government organise track trace system far seem quite efficient jabbing folk arm. Perhaps pros charge rather private companies. Food thought UK Plc. Who's going tell no? retribution would face QI ""union"" mafia backing them? Maybe. Look it. Maybe got modded early idk. Every time see meta comments, they're highly upvoted (like now) covid deniers either deep negative deleted us. can't control upvotes. Pretty sure U.S. government, least, could afford it. want to. back October, I'm boot March broken ankle? Coincidence? Yeah probably. arguing circles. Oh great. covid october. Currently experiencing weird tiredness, energy, always sleepy. hope it’s winter weather taking it’s toll always. Mark Waters first men’s coach USA Olympic skateboard team died today Covid :( monies fort worth runner, professional singer &amp; voice teacher, risk lung damage, virus could take away career, sanity, life, three. It’s terrifying. It’s sooo concerning people see “die” “not die” statistics. virus ramifications decades. still grocery store. Stay safe there. Excuse me, say carnitas ? idea, besides, religious not, sure negative vibes. Covid December. 4 five risk groups. think sense taste smell normal moment. lost maybe 90% sense smell infection, think properly smell bad smells, like cats' litter box. handful times, half hour eat something, suddenly taste mold back throat. different foods prepared take out, I'm pretty sure food. first time happened, threw foods used prepare meal. I'm still somewhat fatigued, residual ""Covid cough"" occasionally.

I'm really afraid I'm going complications asthma. 

And family member (we know who) visited dad funeral. Makes sense still even needing prove covid airborne? evidence overwhelming ""but joe rogan said...."" CNN anchors look like they’ve aged 10 years Trump administration. Kamino course likely SIBO c. Difficile. intestinal fauna likely pulled whack likely Norovirus attack. parents decide gather families local park refuse wear mask.  got viral myocarditis couple years ago. pretty scary - initially thought I'd heart attack due insanely high troponin levels. angiogram, one scariest experiences life. made full recovery, someone said time 1/3 people get make full recovery like me, another 1/3 permanent damage, another 1/3 die quite suddenly - athletes large part last third mention. lot time hear top athlete dying suddenly, myocarditis. Exactly.  Bc freedom comes responsibility, want none that. confused strengths/effectiveness different brands Covid19 vaccines. Maybe analogy use incorrect.

We learned hard way bacterial infections become resistant antibiotics prescribed regimen antibiotics followed fully either strength duration. confusion comes statement reading Covid19 vaccines effectiveness rates ranging 90% 50%. phenomenon exist Covid19 (or virus) treated vaccine less fully effect? simply true. again, ""older adults"" issues...it's people literally near death. Stop spreading misinfo. literally given 10s millions older people vaccine Norway info originally published right wing misinfo site.   That's scares tbh. recently got back skateboarding, imagine without fully functioning lungs. ""Many"". Please quantify instead trying scare people clicks.

There always people suffer long term issues infection. talking 1%, 15%? many? FWIW large urban centers seem lagging behind getting shots arms right now. logistics vaccinating smaller rural population much simpler logistics vaccinating large city. Asking real questions They’re drive Can't read article,  think we'll mocking minimizing people long-term post-viral effects decades. Almost 1 every 70 people. Wow. Well that's great...vaccines would better people poof gone. Time start giving anyone wants scheduling priority said guidelines. post removed cannot verify reliable source.

I mean, ideally don’t catch it. it’s nice know folks recovered better running there. poor ""essential"" worker, I'd still take current rollout. Either way, unless Biden 180, probably access months. April reliable sources saying 200 million Americans already it?

Neato! think make good points, though also think public health value people receive vaccines earlier continuing normalize precautions mask wearing even immunity, broader swath general population also received vaccine.

I've already gotten first dose second couple weeks, likely still use masks public least time afterwards reason. costs nothing helps reinforce mask use generally long still critical preventative measure, feel right thing do. Thank Masks may protect viruses hives bacteria. Sometimes wonder Covid pneumonia cases actually caused bacteria. think there's disconnect colloquial definition ""know"" scientific definition ""know"". scientist can't quantify duration volume virtual spread vaccinated individual publish ""we idea vaccinated individuals spread virus"". Science journalism's job say ""we hard data based past experience risk catching covid someone who's vaccinated pretty much negligible"" still know enough confirm herd immunity actually thing prevents transmissions. latest study indicates prevent Feel bad people gyms though. like government stepped helped anyone this. owner gym open back close good. watched owner, full brown man, crying already sold car know keep place. easy decision him. small classes 6 people time, outside whenever possible, still wear masks it.

So yes! Go researchers evaluated 10,000 COVID-19–related medical papers published English Chinese May 2020. **Among peer-reviewed papers, researchers found 56.1 percent opinions** contain new data.   articles included patient data represented 9.6 percent peer-reviewed studies. researchers evaluated quality research original articles using validated tools assess study design concluded 80 percent risk bias, mainly participants, short follow-up duration, unrepresentative patient selection, poor data interpretation.

COVID virus wearing mask prevents getting later pneumonia. Masks actually also protect bacteria carried via aerosols.  RemindMe! 2 days Looks like I'm moving Michigan. can't, getting Covid long hauler can. 

FYI long haulers tend 20-40. fun! Ha...yet first thing everybody heard “deaths vaccine”  hope people see follow don’t remember first thing heard... within month reporting anything current admin would lame, happens every admin done, things fade away quick. bad using dated cold war language. notice pointed out. next 3-6 months feeling people's attitudes changing see numbers falling everyone's behavior changing approach level herd immunity. 

Even parents acting like probably lighten up. No. think that. saying people went Miami summer think.

I spending month long summer break home (I pool, can't complain first january staying home travelling 10 years). farther 20 minutes house since march.

I think people extremely unethical, illegal. fact you’re comparing mask wearing potty training honestly pretty terrifying Anyone still refuses wear mask point mental health issues correct answer. Impossible compare deaths many variables affect jurisdiction’s number.   L452R variant COVID-19 found 11 California counties, including San Luis Obispo, Humboldt, Lake, Los Angeles, Mono, Monterey, Orange, Riverside, San Francisco, San Bernardino, San Diego.  new COVID variant identified countries states last year. linked several large outbreaks Santa Clara County.

They know much far (how fast spreads, prevalent is, etc). Yup

Again, 13 seriously frail people die

Hardly big issue considering number vaccinations they’ve currently carried I’ll pass bacterial pneumonia thanks immune compromised people able vaccinated actual concern.

These types people always concern. can't ever protect society enough ever safely interact, covid aside. really still ongoing investigation. regular antibiotics combined allergy medicine seems help Everything want come back happened Black Death, Yellow fever, WWI, WWII, atomic bombs, cold war, AIDS, Spanish Flu, holocaust, 9/11/01, etc.  


You better truly unique compelling argument particular event one makes everyone ""unable"" go movie theater w/out wearing face mask.  


If that's mean, specific. Right opinion sounds place Michael Bay movie monologue actual reasoned opinion. According CDC it’s 10 days symptom onset, 24 hours fever without aid fever reducing medication, symptoms improving. Yes one thing responsibly drive car, another irresponsibility refuse wear mask around people. everyone drove responsibly, accident rates would fairly low person? Can't webcam software flags suspicious behaviour? don’t control wether gyms open shut NY, NY, way wait? people mild side effects would fine working unless sore arm going prevent job kid cudi’s grandmother lives long-term care facility lol. like, people getting  Honest question, know sure true yet? know that's assumption hope, last saw still TBD. I'll glad confirmed!  care one bit antivaxxers getting it. immune compromised people able vaccinated actual concern. They're also risk dying. 80% vaccinated doubt full level 3 4 would needed 90% need measures. Everything I've seen says 90% would stop even new variants.

Gee whiz, super short work “the Norwegians” made situation that’s still unfolding 😂 guess PTSD mental issue never read bullshit forum agree know micro (or laboratory) setting spreads. think know lot less real world. think lot learn effectively control it, practical way, society. 

There much contradictory evidence, fair, often see people claim ""action X"" produced ""outcome Y"" could easy another factor. Says guy spending time posting thread said video. Steriods?

Everyone simply tells deal it. woke today fever sore muscles, eventually find COVID, already spread spouse? want isolate it’s nearly impossible, she’s pregnant I’m extremely concerned test comes back positive. Oh population 9million... first comment this:

1) Yeah, we're bad, stats lies

2) Yeah we're bad, stats lies

3) Yeah we're bad, over-count

4) Yeah we're bad, over-count

5) Yeah we're bad, undercount

6) Yeah we're bad, we're better lying stats

7) Yeah we're bad, here's unverified way someone might worse

You think see here?

This govt need subservient cowtowing, they'll get elected next time anyways. stats, people, dead ground, masters deemed unimportant. no, take breath, anything white-hot angry first world, highly developed, well-staffed, well-funded country giving many less two shits corpse-pile worst world. worst.

And capable seeing numbers immediately jump 'yeah but, here's unverfied bullshit opinion spin make possible to... blah blah, face actual graves? deserve calm polite. We'll know months. likely reduction transmission. know exactly much Eradication ain't happening Good read. Thanks sharing It’s complicated mess get vaccines NY. go batch provided federal government first. Governor!  I’m scheduled take Moderna Vaccine tomorrow.

I’m also scheduled go work following 2 days well. 

Would smart call next 2 days work? hope figure people get vaccinated. least would hope studies underway shed light this. vaccinated people transmit (or even greatly reduced) would biggest news since first learned 95% efficacy Places like NYC, New Jersey others involved first peak heavily skew national average treatments improved much.

Second wave places better third wave places even better L452R new variant causing outbreaks San Jose. identified March last year Denmark, found California since May.   okay understand order receive second vaccine receive first, right? 4.4% included within 24.26%. That’s works. Sequelae diseases kept separate drug side effects. *sheepish British noises* Japan better US means well. answer ""why Japan still tests like this"" *shouldn't be* still are. response govt idiotic. Cases go start encouraging people travel. they're skyrocketing put 8pm curfew virus likes nightlife, schools still open fuck safety children, right? absolute joke one's laughing. mostly slept - fine way pass time. No, could show positive test antibodies. 

The PCR test looks viral genetic material nose throat, getting vaccinated.

Of course still get COVID vaccine effective (or already infected getting vaccine), that's always possibility too.  Yes, they'll spread, kind real damage unvaccinated lot (which minority) people, instance.

The idea locking due small spread cases area mass vaccination program efficacy rating 90% bonkers. That's New Zealand bought enough vaccine entire country. Goodness. many though? aren’t yet. definitely peaking though. Yup. lot Midwest states fall surges likely saw achieve 30-40% infection rate among populations. Even infectious strain starting become dominant, think going hard top third wave. state sitting right 10% confirmed infection rate population. Given conservative 3 1 asymptomatic symptomatic rate, looking 40% state gotten it. vaccines coming online, we'll probably see another 10% population gotten vaccine end month. publicized variant late Sunday news conference researchers identified 25 percent samples collected Dec. 14 Jan. 3, surge 3.8 percent samples collected three-week period leading Dec. suggestive, it’s little worrisome,” Charles Chiu, virologist University California San Francisco said briefing. Chiu stressed premature conclude variant infectious scientists know sampling representative, whether variant’s increase might due random chance, even several superspreader events. couldnt agree brexit 4 years would trust health experts told us. Depending variant percentage needing vaccinated stop spread different. new variants may still spread 80% vaccinated might move level 2, locally level 3 (which lockdown light) August. would expect see full national level 4 lockdown ever even start vaccinating. pandemic app fucking useless thing security problem August probably did, probably died spread. "" since don’t know vaccine prevents Covid stops spreading ""

This true... Im spain well, remember, back Nov., everyone bcn fully packed terraces beers, like care world father lost hearing one ear covid Probabky fat unhealthy ...and news whom? Talk college athletes make type assumption. former athlete, absolutely exploited definite factors coercing stay. aren’t getting medical care treatment injuries sustained competition. Sorry, that's actually bullshit. Yes, masks bulletproof keeping COVID bay, saying ""it seem make difference whatsoever"" match science. vaccines could given every year two. However, evidence widespread reinfection. died ventilators? most.

died home? few. stats available, match news says Covid deaths, dying venilators, home complications. Covid new ISIS, claiming all. clear case correlation, causation, underlying variable?

It's stretch assume way sickly old increases odds hospitalization Covid, also increases odds dying within 140 days significantly.

I'm denying Covid might contributing factor, probably misleading say sole culprit killing 1/8 patients 140 days. Makes sense low income country means low resources low tests, actual cases could much higher, also healthcare worse countries can't affors treat large number covid patients. Outdoor.

I've tried indoor, can't stay focused long enough.

The additional distraction ""oooh look, thing"", freedom explore, one biggest things keeps goal.

Also, made 100%. What's funny back Febuary CNN literally published article Americans concerned flu covid 19. Boy tables turn March lmao almost constant drone fear news covid people scared minds. Life risk. beauty freedom make mind risk tolerance. cousin runs London marathon starts behind elite, gf can't even walk stairs without stopping breath. got end march. Bartolo stands 90 min/game gains weight. Yes, two big unknowns: 

1. likely true all? (Highly likely certain); and
2. likely individual falls safe, majority group?

Data lacking large number unvaccinated risk, need remain cautious. vaccine *does* prevent infection. like every vaccine does. Measles, tetanus, mumps, diphtheria, German measles, pertussis, chickenpox, meningitis, HPV, etc.

They haven’t done explicit study confirm (until now, one works), that’s immunity works.

But since hasn’t hitherto study, CDC get away saying don’t know crowd control tactic. Again, like pretended didn’t think surgical cloth masks going prevent virus spreading.

In hindsight, you’d blind, deaf, dumb ever believe cloth surgical masks wouldn’t effect spread respiratory virus. Likewise believe 95% effective vaccine wouldn’t prevent infection transmission.

“The data out” way keep us safe unvaccinated people either revolting pretending vaccinated cheat system. It’s actually sincere expression uncertainty. get ill enough covid hospitalised probably pretty bad way begin with. disease hits infirm old hardest, remember average age death life expectancy UK. confirm. introvert, could read, write count year ahead peers stayed year ahead throughout school. Never serious social issues discipline problems (haha til senior said F school that's grandparents). 

Kids survived several Millenia without daycare pre-school time peers. Play OG Deus Ex taste what's coming world. ain't pretty People comments acting like wearing mask save you. Ive wearing mask day 1 following measures, still got covid, many people... Theres chance somehow get metter what, calling people ""ignorant"" got infected moronic. Anti inflammatory pain medications addictive. buy ibuprofen otc. Actually favorite ""expert worried that..."". make article something someone worried about, literally speculation facts. gets zillion upvotes reposted distributed countless times. Yeah, think.

When kid, doctors made kinds leg workouts knees would randomly dislocate. told ligaments long I'd compensate muscle.

I still bend fingers back touch back hand issue tens thousands stranded overseas tourism. Although that's also issue really tried charitable towards article, said absolutely nothing makes believe claims true. even re-read make sure I'm missing something.

It offers zero data, offers weird conclusions rely zero data. Scarred lungs permanent I'm afraid. lungs okay small scars, permanent. It’s obvious *reduces* transmission - less serious symptoms shorter recovery time correlated lower viral loads. extent reduction don’t data and, - stop unvaccinated falsely claiming immunity - prudent thing assume transmission risk acceptable level either way. Ive trying figure Elliot thing covid related, Mike mccarthy related, andy dalton related. First time seeing “pitcher” “prime professional athlete” sentence   hate say going last coronavirus maybe last pandemic.

But we're going much better prepared next time. think vaccination technology going major thing going forward. Moderna says they're already working vaccine HIV using similar technology. Yep got friend “no symptoms” massive blood clots legs learned rolling ankle X-ray. Clearly guy isn’t airport would probably one last places I’d want covid Yeah really feel you. frustrating. understand countries well getting running domestically cutting international travel sustainable really hurts people. likely vaccinated May/June even girlfriends country likely let vaccination necessarily stop transmission, able START vaccinate meaningful amount mid 2021. looking later year....maybe. countries shifting goalposts taking risk averse approach end sight. 

I handle long distance long required, however idiocy gets me. zero covid strategy work half world begins opening borders, vaccinated accept transmission occur without serious health impacts. closed indefinitely...it make sense. Thankyou think way know would guess combination widespread exposure vaccine starting kick in. vaccinations give effectiveness 10-12 days 31-32 days people already second shots. focusing at-risk population impacting hospitalizations cases. get vaccine, Im still precautious. Last thing want virus. don’t trust others right thing us know everything. vaxxed know transmissions/variants - it’ll way life Yes no. They'll try attack anything may symptoms like palpitations become bit tachy, resolve recover. Covid attacks permanently damages CV system. Backdoor left open. Yes , old hedging bets, said hospitals also factually inaccurate, pointed out! bad thing do? change. Johnson Johnson pledged make vaccine profit, investment broker told expect stock market movement based results.  show mentioned pub? Also say, expert supports lockdowns, onus side explain consequences, noticed stats indicates cancer diagnosis likely due less people attending appointments less appointments available, put policy, job explain happened. 29.4%? You’re solving 1/8 100% 8 100% times like these, feel sudden urge rewatch Repo: Genetic Opera middle thinking ""Fuck lost sense taste able enjoy occasional cigarette"" thing wrong thought hit me. friend mine nurse cardiologists office. 

She seeing 10x normal number kids come office past year. Shea never seen anything like 20+ years. I've downvoted much since March saying there's worse things death covid. Ruining health next 60/50/40 years etc wearing mask blows mind.

There evidence start fucks organs never fully recover (because organs can't recover, that's organ surgery)

I feel sorry idiots thinking ""it happen me"" spend rest lives without career wanted long lasting health issues.

Wear mask avoid close contact people, difficult thing do. dying. Yeah blame that. still think risk even vaccinated point. wish anything else  Wow maybe day forever known Inflection Point Day.

The first shot vaccine around 50% effective 10-12 days. 32 days... bunch shots providing effectiveness.

I expect hospitalizations fatalities go faster cases we're vaccinating risk first. much this. 

Everyone keeps talking kids dying schools safe they're dying...

But one talking long term damage growing bodies. news. every school board talking about.

But no, want economy open. I'm healthcare worker shots still feel comfortable attending concerts point. Especially unmasked. Australia's policy going zero, would expect part international travel stopped probably well 2022. obvious? vaccine doesn’t prevent infection serious disease. Nothing shows prevents transmission people still get infected develop symptoms. Agreed. 

To fair tho, don’t many viruses flu bugs actually leave heart negatively impacted least short time? Per article self quarantine still required even test comes back negative. One nurse coworkers got COVID month critic thinking little...off.

He flipped thinking something wrong patient sun-downing. 😐 wrote exactly - ""governing bodies"". 

Once more: Closing pubs shoe stores independent hospital management. Yeah barely 50% success rate em plural way ""many people disappointing summers due covid"" even though there's one summer since covid Probably both. weekends also seem slow areas. shots given Sundays state Virginia. sure why... sure plenty demand them. get people need time c'mon there's pandemic on. Hey stranger.

I hope kick ass.   Seems strictly people Australia problem us locked out. Australian well, I'm quite okay arrangement since data backup claims vaccine prevent transmission *yet*.

I sure want people care potentially come contact virus end life long maladies potentially die. Sure I'd like travel safe realistic year. Lying home ""mild"" case right now. scaring death! know caught it, totally masked work, really careful hand washing, grocery shopping, etc. I'm terribly frightened moment. Yes is. Covid extremely less lethal harmful children. know every piece data reinforces this. folks dont like pointed openly lied to. alot.

I dont say Covid denyer. one remembers told masks unnecessy, two weeks lockdown only, ongoing parade leaders asking lockdown, traveled went reastarants marched parades confused European. actually take office?  flu vaccine 39% effective last year 29% year 90-95% Pfizer Moderna really good.

The percentage comes statistics given lot people. Like tested say 10,000 people 95% get sick. 

The reasons complicated, stimulates immune system etc. vaccine cure instead programs immune system respond encounters virus. Good luck getting concrete advice anti-inflammatory Lyme recovery doctor. experience others hand it’s Wild West something GP medicine good handle since 90s.

Here’s advice doctors exactly /u/stackered  guess would almost people already virus. Hopefully I'm right immunity fitness room, live, still lockdown! folks understand Pandemic deadly serious? uhhh,,, Nurse here. There's one charge nurse particular kept blowing COVID fear said ""Well going get anyway work hospital blah blah."" Pissed end despite young I'm immunocompromised.

But guess what? I'm one employees gotten COVID (through exposure outside means) got second COVID shot day.

Can't wait see give smug ""You're wrong guess who's still healthy?"" face. Yep agree  Millions kids growing COVID related disabilities zero understanding fuck growing bodies. 

We're raise entire generation pre-existing conditions. know 2 people received shots, ones ER nurse rich. sincerely hope setting bar sub zero low far exceed expectations... wish better idea could May 1st. don’t think media making effort understand it. profit companies, making money priority, make money, factually correct, informative, that’s great. it’s rare. 

I dont know anyone could watch mainstream news coverage covid think ever trying actually educate inform public virus. feel like bones? muscle, bones ache, too. Also, itching? know COVID, mild symptoms mid-March. Now, everything hurts. Anti-inflammatories nothing, tylenol nothing. Blood work showed nothing. Doc, try Cymbalta, Rheumatologist diagnosed fibromyalgia ""it's trash disease"" nothing else could determined. going aince September. get vaccine today, ""safe""? amount people received second shot, advertised 95% immunity likely trivial March. lag first needle immunity problem timelines. I’m convinced it’s one two people say things 1) people social whatsoever 2) Stockholm syndrome times end walking next other, example, walking pavement side road Family member severe case mono teen 50 years ago (they initially thought dying leukemia sick) never fully recovered. heart always funky EKG, chronic fatigue real. 

I'm honestly scared wave long term problems Covid. People understand ""fatigue"" medical symptom. can't ""rest day"" better. Well, even looking population difference, US still 3 times many deaths per capita. Israel administered tests per capita even might conservative. closing pub delay appointment doctor? biggest covid denier know said yesterday ""Biden said he's going shut everything down."" said ""Theres caravan illegals headed left going let give everything.""  People need stop misinformation disinformation. Every day try go work thing hear much crazy talk. can't talk reasonably, we'll never solve problems. That's true, may living unseen humanitarian disaster, too.

Who knows situation truly like Rwanda Angola, villages?

Currently, metrics numbers available us, sole source concrete data, making choices based that.

But could end up, 5, 10 years this, conducted in-depth worldwide studies, actually right.

We know can't know. Obviously, older populations risk, without access supplementary oxygen hospitals, even healthy 30 year olds die due COVID. People locked inside houses 10 mos now. lost jobs diminished earnings. sitting couch eating junk gaining weight. Depression would shocking diagnosis all.  deservedly so. impact vaccines either way. I'm overseas alot. friends around world ask WTF America send one clip fully understand USA. Brad Pitt Killing Softly. ""AMERICA COUNTRY, BUSINESS."" That's March case also lost 60 pounds actually fairly good year physically ( mentally well. 2020 all) I've disabled 14 years burst brain aneurysm. Well want see getting covid mild symptoms. Siu back segregating ourselves? travel internationally year, see family relatives. fuck ass.

No. can't visitors right now. produce emissions making stuff consume, fun. would different companies making shit. Tory party was. matter Tony Blair one came Private/public partnerships. pretty much proved Tory even party wasn't. predict uniformly-dosed vaccine antibodies expire. much natural antibodies.

Why create ""Digital Standart"" already existing document? ask again: widley used? feel exactly same. driving insane home almost ten months? Yes. Would risk long term health problems result exposure? Absolutely not. would choose inconvenient distance learning day risking cardiac damage preventable health problem. I’ve surprised pushback I’ve gotten family friends it, they’re kids #1 job keep safe. Also bodybuilder, here. Natty I’m getting older I’ve debating getting TRT. best bud got phd Harvard implores wait covid. guess studies link high testosterone levels severe covid. 

Not elitist dictate what’s important others bodybuilding something NEED physical mental stability. say going gym (as safe possible) worth risk. However, don’t understand average/casual person would dare risk going. could get away push-ups various things home, would.

Anyway. Stay safe keep gaining, bud. know fuck saying tbh Came ask definitely sound same. saying antibodies present 90% people making judgement symptoms anything else? Yes, everything fake news, except conspiracy pages reddit fox news, everybody lying except Yeah pretty amazing put perspective. UK experiencing slightly deaths fully twice number cases per day Australia experienced since pandemic began.  Nurse! beginning. Kind risky move especially long term given second open risk huge outbreak given population community immunity whatsoever. seems paid now.

But lockdowns starting 6 months pandemic, country like Italy/Spain/Germany/... virus already everywhere, hope eradicating even slowing spread significantly? Pure madness. Ex-post data talks clear.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  saving lives trumps everything, make lockdown permanent? (I support present *reductio ad absurdum* common pro-lockdown argument). Fake news guru spotted^ Republicans right ACCESS good healthcare, don’t give shit actually making affordable everyday person though. what? pretty much risk. That’s viruses do, mutate. gonna get afraid every virus mutation. Unbelievable. don’t see fear mongering evident, truly feel sorry you. super spreader event start finish    work cardiology, started cautious took proper precautions new disease spreading rapidly.

Then late spring/early summer reports coming attacking CV system complete lock life. fact attacks cardiovascular system viciously make anyone take utmost precautions. *not* fuck around virus damage heart. many problems too, neuropathy joint pain post covid pneumonias. We’ve healthy young guy bad post covid pneumonia (as covid severe enough need hospitalization) ecmo almost two months. It’s crapshoot. 

A colleague got work March changed around ppe protocols ( plus got many teats per day back couldn’t screen every patient). beautiful healthcare woman still January. like flu her. never needed hospitalization. short breath, chronic migraines, nerve pain. 

There still many unknowns. family gave flack getting vaccine. said many unknowns it. Well, know lot possible outcomes contracting covid no-brainer get shots. really think novavax vaccine going ends working best 65+. appears stimulate extremely strong response relying machinery host cells effective... Keep mind elderly people also elderly cellular level.

Problem people 65+ want vaccinated time rolls out.

Meanwhile, US enough vaccine ordered Pfizer Moderna vaccinate 200M people July. That's pretty much every adult willing get vaccinated. really see need ration vaccine efficacy. even know institution strict inflexible it. I'm pretty sure State *isn't* punishing hospitals giving leftover vaccines imminently expiring thrown away. know fact hospitals city flexible this. 

I guess coming admins? usual... man opinion, better downvote him. people ridiculous. sad :( hope fully recover get back better ever  can't say there's options. allowed. Perhaps vertigo main issue fyi  people lockdown zeal guess “Many patients” talks one guy’s experience this. positive “brain fog” fatigue directly tied COVID?

So comments want complain people taking pandemic seriously, maybe give criticism journalists mislead overstate headlines they’re projecting. second study patients initially required hospitalization. Question don’t ton info it:
My dad went hospital covid released days later. blood clot lungs gave something “should good 3 months” something (I believe plasma transfusion something else). anyone experience happens 3 months?  think people need stop comparing numbers. amount extra persons need infected drop percentages studies small might variance. long around 90% good enough pretty much exactly result.  Belgian government insisted lying months. stop then? Excess deaths Australia negative consequence lockdowns. Still remember people irresponsibly said ""it regular flu"" sure what's country would like politicians they're right now? anyone takes shot plus me, even tho I'm vaccined.

they'll still reduce chance reach me, still win - win situation imo know Italy one, completely useless. Poor adoption authorities able make proper use data.  covid last year march ever since ive mucus can't get rid of, almost year... Exactly, prime, hence quote proposing lockdown till zero cases. Question: effective Israel's use cell phone ""Health Surveillance"" tracing COVID-19? effective Track &amp; Trace systems used invasive privacy? Short answer Yes. longer answer earlier sharing censor myself. Got covid early summer. ongoing breathing troubles since. Got diagnosed Asthma December. I’m 39 running half marathons last year, year barely walk bathroom without getting breath. Got infected December mild symptoms. gone, last two days airways kinda hurt think experiemced short breath...
I'm scared. That's idiotic. human brain work way Using viral disease started China I’d take Australia handling nearly countries. Enjoy locking dull spread. least lock eradicate come news us. heard almost year ago, still hear people say bad outcomes come dying hospitalized. Going interesting countries people got sick going economically ten years so. Especially since countries put economy first excuse contain it. winning gamble even short term. Frankly think controversial vaccinate making vaccines first. people learned yet workplace outbreaks derail production? can't afford vaccine production, development, distribution delayed workplace outbreaks. people think require humans make? Someone severe asthma home covid, articles scaring shit me.. I'm lucky o2 machine.  MRNA vaccines? made quickly

MRNA vaccines developed quickly, takes us May last year. that, would still need accelerated approval, production, delivery vaccine. Pfizer currently production capability MRNA traditional vaccines, either, although change.

If degree cross-immunity people still get sick, albeit highly unlikely turn critical, manageable. not, however, would still looking several months, year, new pandemic could rage (or go deep lockdown stop early could done early 2020). get reasoning behind feels place. wanna show live footage people getting vaccinated, ask consent NEED vaccine recorded. I’d personally rather see doctor, nurse even elderly person explain feel fine jab, compared politician public figure. It’ll Easter heck yeah way go neighbour singapore ❗❗❗ blew up!

Consequences. ridiculously stupid people afraid vaccine covid. always mistake articles: People go screenings HIGH PREVALENCE, can't go shoe shopping. [They're last phases becomes recommended.  Curious, flu tests also testing flu instead flu B? sick dog 2019 flu season Jan 2020 treated flu despite failing flu strep test. \+1, that's is. Doctors deal well things get clear cut diagnosis for, everything else ""anxiety"" patient's side. post-viral (or post-infection) condition, often broad presentation, good luck getting one take complaints seriously. one hand get it, there's nothing do, there's much tell you. would nice taken seriously get human sympathy rather dismissed ""anxious"". 

Talking someone developed reactive arthritis mild bout throat infection. left basically bedridden days joints screaming pain. Went away half year still grin bear 2 doctors told anxiety hyper aware body. Yeah nah  already yearly influenza aircraft invented.  100% impossible there's actual health issues play, kind constant terror state live fact state confined us life work/eat/sleep social contact would expect create effects like above.

I know sure me.

Or maybe sarcastic :) hard tell days. added risk definitely need take, let's straight facial paralysis thing that's happening people. 

People actually dying vaccine, undeniable! pregnancy-induced insomnia.

Never open Australia ever even 90% nation vaccinated Fucking dystopian question pretty funny. Motherfuckers rolling slow shit!!  money pandemic ravaged world economies. Everyone onboard putting much money R&amp;D it. comes Asia

Nice fake news there. Influenza endemic entire human population, come waves specific place. stopping air traffic merely slowed down. dude Vietnam whole worried virus, except months max, closing border allowing tourists, mandatory 14 day quarentine everyone entering way it. Country, except tourism, still booming small slow down. seventy tennis players participating Australian Open quarantine. find hard believe college students fair better. Well shit fucking kidding me? brain fog psychosematic? probably something immune system difficult diagnose.... believe it’s psychosematic please go Peru eat Palo santo let shaman spit water tend come terms like Depression IBS catch-all. There's also long term studies effects mRNA vaccines they're also using ingredients higher toxicity regular vaccines I've read. Honestly starting hate california numbers accurate, testing low. That’s you’d use data for. You’d use data determine severity frequency one lasting symptom vs another track recovery times affected. could easily determine pattern symptoms question prove disprove COVID lasting effects all, comment seems raising question. Nice, sounds promising, countries equally successful, that's life guess. know, seems like people starting enough looking actual data back say October. data paints *very* clear picture what's actual health risks. One cannot justify what's done based ex-post data have.

So, terror ""unknown"", cause know really scary all. Long covid, variants, on. trying best keep fear train running people starting much afraid.

Why want keep people afraid? really idea, makes zero sense. someone struggled health anxiety time, striking similar symptoms long-covid ones experienced past years: brain fog, fatigue, joint pain, heart palpitations, etc. state hyper-awareness body sensations, uncommon suffer unspecified symptoms.

I'm saying long-covid exist, certainly does, would surprised strong psychosomatic element lot people. mean long-covid symptoms dismissed, feel real, think constant bombardment media anecdotal evidence could reinforcing suggestive element lot cases. time would called everyone slightly anti lockdown anti measures science denier fucking idiot till became one myself. amount disgusting fear mogering single reason became blind side, actually ton valid points. 

It's sad appearently ""Covid also super dangerous young people. Everyone quarantine stop doing"" attitude come back. Seems like people appearently even politicians clue lockdowns actually for.

Certainly protect healthy 18 year old virus gonna survive 99,9% time. talking something life-or-death massive economic consequences. acceptable opinion beginning wouldn’t mess covid would blip radar.

I’m usually free speech, something big impact like this. tolerant dangerous opinions sends message opinions acceptable consequences that, i.e. condition America Europe now. Dude never ending muscle body aches driving insane. get that, especially night wake up? Feels like you’ve getting lightly trampled joints creaky bustef years? It’s year... sounds bit like (though random viral cold, covid). Persistent cough + shortness breath ~6 months ultimately diagnosed adult onset, cough-variant asthma. daily inhaler helped ton. Though I’d imagine would first thing doctors would check for.

The constant tickle throat makes wonder, though - tried Tessalon perles? Sometimes coughing bit perpetual-motion machine act coughing keeps irritating nerve causes urge cough first place, thus making cough more... also happen kid. Tessalon basically turned cough reflex long enough things calm back down. fucking sucks, ur weak, ur body heavy, ur sore overall feel like shit. hope deniers get know bad be. Dont remember prediction bundle flames remember saying empty shelves, cues borders, difficulty travelling among many others? came true, not? would level vaccination EU, mind controlling authoritarian government. think we've seen negatives leaving EU outweigh positives stupid believe Brexit lies Right. coverage Covid variants been...interesting say least Thanks mate. choice federal help available. Gyms online classes outdoor workouts needed. lot gotten creative. Restaurants takeout now. restrictions *months*. needed, right California cases control. Businesses continuing stay open contributing spread...therefore prolonging this. 0 sympathy them. 

Furthermore, researched several businesses defying orders, guess what? lot following proper covid guidelines. examples, gyms allow people take masks inside studio. enough distancing people. businesses need shut first place, can't even follow basic rules. 

Businesses aside, plenty people defying orders, traveling, gathering, wearing masks. Plenty. ""stay home"" order California tons traffic people about. looks different pandemic. numbers accurate super low figures picked international propaganda? confirmed cases. wonder number people know. country big serology testing program might discover approximate percentage people know. Yep. course covid denier - covid clearly thing. response completely lunatic. 

It's like people 2020 forgot death thing old sick people die time time. Dnno, works pretty well Aus. series 3-7 day lockdowns seemingly suppressed outbreaks allowing us live almost normal lives. Crowds sports, indoor dining sill almost 0 cases. 
Jump early, jump hard seems work  would argue price taking hit young bodies small compared everything giving up; plus damage temporary. Deaths statistic matters Totally. I’m like Covid Denier anything like that, seems bit weird every single year (16-17-18-19) read articles point overflowing hospitals around time. Like Coronas seasonality factor right ? Like it’s surprising it’s blowing rn  Probably less. understand, want understand. and/or livelihood depends understanding Depends. bad effects virus appear inflammation related. person inflamation problems live with, virus amplify issue. person handles inflammation rather ignore it, might pull alright. Lots bodybuilders know science keep inflammation down. Many bro-science walking inflammation bombs. Good job! see effective new UK South African variants. friends Dad mild covid days, month later hospital week called “long covid” nearly died phase 3 results. reporting phase 1/2 results 90% later 100% antibodies. 95% efficacy reported Biontech Moderna vaccines (or \~70% AstraZeneca). Yep

Why want take vaccine?  Panama, Chile, Bolivia, Peru? hot weather still surge. South Africa? Wow that's fantastic. Looking back, morning coffee tasting abnormal first symptom. 

I felt perfectly normal simply dismissed it. I'm terrible making acceptable coffee thought I'd gotten worse. [non-paywall lol today, 7 people life died covid19. unfortunately hard data find, along previous 2020 ICU/hospital occupancy time year.

Also, testing flu massively test covid. did, would probably found numbers order magnitude. Consider Italy around [96% covid positive cases found either asyptomatic light (source, ISS - italian official government data), people never would gone hospital 2019. 

Plenty articles around 2015 onwards say ""hospitals limits"", including setting emergency tents outside, flu. even opinion. idea *only* allowed opinion. I'm really sorry hear that. defense doctors really much chronic fatigue sydnrome vaguely understand condition. vaccinations begin ramping spring summer however definitely begin lifting restrictions impact healthcare systems drastically lessened. doomed fail without proper stimulus rely on. I'm angered businesses adhere rules, also understand feel choice sink swim.  flotation device available. no, think parties happened holidays keep trying explain people people dying ventilators. sing lot, aware breath capacity. got it, speak single sentence without pause breath. year I've still got breath capacity back. used able breath 'down' diaphragm; feels like there's sort block get 40%.

Bye aviation industry. Bye bye. 👋 checked many cases Straya tallied since began. Worldometers says 28,721. forget whole US -- home state Texas roughly matches Straya's population (29MM us vs. 25.66MM Australia). 

Texas 6 distinct *days* added cases Australia entire pandemic. last 7 weeks, meaning December month. hardest day, Dec. 11th, saw 56,238 new cases ... damn near **double** Australia's entire run. one Godforsaken day   That’s propaganda is. 

The evidence didn’t come U.K. originates *from scientists*. mapped back virus’ family tree starting Italy, gave link. 

At time used governments block trade routes U.K. mainly France. 

When comes ‘SA variant’, didn’t know much risk was. Scientists didn’t say would. said sure checking.

It’s possible Health Minister trying divert attention U.K. variant freaked much caused trade routes blocked. It’s still propaganda it’s inept.  think Ameican? Americand youth said fuck elders? Hopefully play ways. foreigners Australia, also Australians allowed countries. Quid pro quo.

England gets farther end! think caught back March (before testing widely available, confirmation me) ten months later I'm still recovered. used able jog four flights stairs carrying backpack full groceries barely walk one flight unencumbered without getting winded. felt like dying sick, aftereffects still hitting hard. might sound like daft question vaccines actually work? groups vaccine testing didn’t come contact anyone covid placebo groups did? trust science stop worrying? easily quarantined depending arrival, could get vaccines. two new vaccines coming soon emergency approval supplies back ones. It’s problem everyone thinks is. found MMA nephew contracted Covid second time (documented). fantastic shape. concerning think wider implications. thinking end losing sense taste I’d start eating super healthy normally disgusting food wouldn’t normally eat. Might well sense can’t taste anything anymore anyway. tried pineapple juice? always helps tickling feeling masks sometimes seems like never know there's pandemic going here. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* focus Americans? Last time checked Olympics international event. hard time requirement, every minute spend someone one party infected chances increase. Confirmed cases SA falling number people tested increasing. possible variant actually infectious all.

[Source \[Our World sure hope doesn’t happen me. November started running again. I’m actually better used Right on. took beginning went back work started requiring masks. cases rampant I'm going try take get vaccine. True Thing know first need stop spread wait years monitor anyne tested positive… need data prevent infection fucking dumbass, “anecdotes” since early last year, since people “mild cases” report health still fucked months infection... one hundred percent true. media sub absolutely addicted doom must discuss every single variant amount pointless “variant” non stories reaching fever pitch lately. Gotta drive clicks many many? Vaccination already required travel countries. nothing new think something worry about.  I'm sure I've missed reports not, seen preliminary data effectiveness coming vaccines yet? absolutely ridiculous. Get population vaccinated open borders. Yes may small outbreaks vulnerable protected it’s going big deal. attributed SARs part required treatment exact thing could said worldometer data, though. difference worldometer data covidtrackingproject data CDC data worldometer covidtrackingproject use daily preliminary data states. CDC uses finalized data states there's lag numbers compared daily trackers. regarding fish vector part, know, lab actually tests it. remember time pretty sure animals can't get covid? tell us would test fishes vector already articles written people credentials saying animals can't get infected? again, test virus via mice unless altered corona virus infect animals?

i think everyone content articles professionals covid19 spreads via aerosol impossible via animals/food etc without even need depth tests researches.

also regarding sushi part, remember Japan one hygienic standards food preparations, can't say much rest world, even proper standards, can't assume everyone following it, else finding corona virus frozen salmon ice cream right? cook salmon, risk would virus contaminating utensils prepped, ice cream, pretty sure virus goes straight body high chance contaminating surroundings like using hand dip dripping icecream proceed rub eyes, many people would practice wash hands time home? Norway thing non issue. It’s people 85 plus hospice level condition. idiot company said ""hopes get covid get 2 weeks work get caught video games"". 

Yep. we're dealing with. Minks used coats. Paint brushes made mink instance. doubt toddler suffer longterm psychological impact living isolation long. imagine counseling fix that.

Kids resilient. long interacting locking closet fine. Teaching play well kids age even easier they're little older mature likely. always sit play toys teach share etc. 

Frankly kids spend time adults children often show school better vocabulary adult-like ways reacting situations.  still specific enough, though. ""inoculating"" mean fully vaccinating, starting process?

*Fully* vaccinating 100 million people 100 days (2 doses) lot harder starting vaccination process 100 million people 100 days (just giving first dose). former effectively takes 21-28 days time limit. “appropriate amount fat” scenario? article sounds like bro-science. one saying that. also, one point checking see correlation. True

Considering we're already upwards 4% vaccinated less populated states it'll likely end country early summer really dense cities holding restrictions bit longer higher ROI fight similar problems NJ. Government completely dysfunctional, moany issues even begin listing. one party supermajority levels, one's (voters) gonna vote party anyway, there's basically political discourse. 

Our pandemic response disaster here, massive death toll care homes vaccines going bad shelf. Nonsensical ""science"" mandates people wearing mask ten foot walk table restaurant, etc. Sigh, checked post history, right. predictable. upvoted dig WHO, second Europe verge collapse, ""Australians never able leave again"". ""China bed laughing ass off"", etc etc.

Not single negative word see US Federal leadership, although negative words Dem run states.

Why always like this? coordinated, favourable commentators get signal boosted/free upvotes? like minded people going ""you're right, NZ *does* sound like hell hole""? people praying Oxford got best results trust anyone else, bashing Pfizer Moderna like Apple-vs-PC. laid back, phone call answered questions like around leading becoming symptomatic etc. seemed like trying get contact tracing info. hung asked told go back retest that’s told said. heard friend it, needed negative test come isolation. guess process changed recently friend exaggerating dramatic. What's hold AZ?

Didn't get approved UK? isn’t incivility it’s quote meme. think lot vaccine doubters rn (myself included), Biden might taking account. Corey Crawford, NHL goalie recently retired well apparently said simply play anymore. COVID summer, can't help wonder something it. California worst job earth!!! Im expert think so. attack spike protein. Plus it'd kind asshole move get two people gotten one guys getting vaccines?


Cries African  Insane. Thanks sharing. tell people ""LOL"" ""Lots Love"" ;) started epilepsy/migraine medication makes chocolate make gag can't taste carbonation ALL... first debating whether worth it, debilitating migraines recently thought evolve sort absent(?) seizure something like (i can't remember name it, new me) makes think definitely so. Though still want covid, I'd cry taste anything ever again. got voted hell dared mention Florida managed handle pandemic response, economic impact vaccine better places like NJ, NY CA. live NJ make happy. emergency medical care happens outside medical setting. Also, significant majority folks adverse reaction, receiving medical care.. vaccination *definitely* moral. lucky survived. experiencing lasting side effects virus don’t fully know well enough. brain-fog forgetfulness disturbing - know won’t issue later life? Give people higher risk early onset Alzheimers? don’t want scare you, I’m saying haven’t dealt virus long enough know it’s lasting damage bodies. instance, Aunt, recovered still searches words middle sentences. cousin mild case recovered, barely climb flight stairs without newly prescribed inhaler. brain, lungs, heart - it’s obviously lasting effect vital organs can’t mindset “we’ll recover we’re young”. It’s selfish it’s damaging stigma we’re thinking through. 

So please continue tell story. definitely moral. make one person take precautions seriously, worth it. SOME???? MAKE LOT! plus lot people give leftovers families friends instead ones come first line. people shortage always horrendous corruption. booster follow took back equal Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna I'd say yes. Otherwise, even 5x I'd say unless country high acceptance rate like 80-90%. US seems like get like 50% vaccinated we'll start hitting resistance lower efficacy ones got would bad idea. Best option lockdown next four weeks link read it? we’ve getting brigaded months mods aren’t anything People really need stop viewing COVID similar flu viewing chronic condition similar HIV hepatitis. Try March... pretty much done mid March think really meaningful sense point could write article like this. ""Covid patients grow third lung"" - experts fear. Remember started used xrays confirm it? think pre NY mostly Asia. Swiss cheese lungs could near asymptomatic still remember right.   Necessary point one vaccinating children yet. are, international travel complicated.  National lockdown needed now. experience mono enough avoid COVID like ...um...the plague. 

I don’t think people really understand “fatigue” medical symptom means. 

It sucks go life able predict enough energy activity signed time rolls around. 

And much don’t want symptoms dictating life, takes pushing bit far you’re headed relapse. 

Been dealing long term effects something got 17 30 years. Oregon pretty low, opened huge vaccination centers state fairgrounds run national guard. went like #40 % doses arms #3. slow states still catch things like that. think may misusing word “reinfection” could cause confusion, thus, downvotes. Everything go kind normalcy entire world acknowledges airborne transmission. pandemic could stopped forever without vaccines 41 days. Lol, actually thought joking around.


Get well soon! May hand sanitizers taste disgusting :) Australia see locals trying pass horrifying American figures like it’s good thing. day saw “only 0.3% New Yorkers died, it’s deadly!”  

(The numbnut I’m thinking didn’t realise death rate total population, known infected.) feds got first right refusal. tried directly, shot down. 

Pfizer manufactures Andover.

Moderna manufactures Norwood.

If really going would run 24/7 vaccination clinics parking lots manufacturing plants. shipping. storage. logistics. Comes manufacturing line goes arm. number covid deaths relevant question here. discussing whether vaccinated elderly dying higher rate non-vaccinated elderly. since we’ve “Vaccine Monday!” Earlier late summer... Try May June places pandemic July 4th would add, also south 25th parallel, people get sun. Thus healthier intake vitamin D. really tell citizens never leave country vacation tourism industry permanently destroyed? 

Lmao, upvotes?

Once everyone's vaccinated we're exact boat everyone. point, let in, that's people would want. hell about?  said five days ago coming soon. fairly likely today (usually releases Monday stock boosts). want go get without appointment, too. 

Would ok that? How's even possible? ""IT FLU. "" 😑😐😐 Lord Darwin approves. I’ve thought this.

I think it’s deadly enough cause significant problem hospitals... deadly enough cause people incur existential fear would result radical changes behavior.

If get it, extremely high chance survival, anything, long-term detrimental effects always deterrent (I vaping type lol). 

If death rate SARS 1 transmissibility COVID, really believe would widespread freak occurring right now. People would scared straight... least larger degree.

There always “fuck it” crew, would much smaller imo. like news like really freaks younger person tested negative covid infection. mean I’m fucked forever possibly won’t know? Kind fucked existence, don’t super high level activity right don’t feel like noticed ton symptoms worried eventually Right. want know percent people actually experience long term damage, long term damage actually is. plenty people infected spring, know studies individuals they're almost year later start get idea kind damage COVID generally do. Covid right absolutely whooping me. Can't even imagine dealing flu time. Sorry go that, sounds fuckin awful. sucks, good know permanent, come back. mean taste completely gone, belive treatments (some sort retraining regime), look up.  significantly sooner August. Try May. Back full normal July 4th including full stadiums etc That's projection. Pandemic largely Easter meaningful sense here, I'm winded every time walking steps. feel like created disabled generations...

Given reason preferring JCVI recommended approach? receive 100000 jabs day, twice week 150000 jabs day three times week, tonight. *your outlook

It's early pretend know ""everything gonna okay"". I'd pensive cautiously realistic. highly doubt athlete forced play. fact, I’m 99% sure renege commitment make. Literally players exploited pro-leagues say can’t play us turn 20 (or whatever age). that’s schools it, that’s leagues.  exactly scares people whole ff- ing pandemic. Mainly rich Western Society. governments citizens. doses multiple like 5x? least consider it? booster follow up? Sorry, left word sight. Busy replied, lucky vaccine speed process. Damn supposed let economy crash. Anyone that’s high risk Covid stay home go public. you’re 35 good health it’s fine go small things

It’s like want everything fall apart. can’t lockdown risk economy going shit, also can’t go around like crazy. 12th island! correct never pandemic Petco Park baseball stadium—home San Diego Padres. Social distancing never meaningful enforcement. bunch signs one cares like cancer warning everything sold California. many angry videos see social distancing? 70% likely approved US. I'd guess 80 85 minimum interesting. also experiencing brain fog? covid November brother girlfriend family acts like I'm stupid tell taste comes goes stuff still taste right. thank letting know I'm imagining lol Yeah, provably avoidable, dozen countries dealt fine minimal infection/deaths, list includes populous country world, China. country earth excuse screw ignorant, stupid arrogant. best wishes friend  Unfortunately really true think takes 6 weeks actually get good level antibodies know ton people gotten vaccine. Close 10. legit people get it, know two work home beaucrats vaccinated. Ah ok. least you’re psycho. Although don’t seem good reading comprehension. according governor Oregon, I'm sure know better. New Jersey de facto opened anyone. money prevent flu pales comparison million preventable things deal daily basis. Redditors bunch miserable assholes love nothing tear America down, Europeans generally keep quiet countries' problems. That's thread less 200 upvotes less 100 comments.

In Sweden, example, nursing home workers paid terribly can't afford work - that's one reason Sweden many deaths. People went work sick. cases dropped much Europe May September? COVID seasonal? bears mentioning laughably low bar is. They're 1M/day NOW. total cluster fuck release far STILL pace meet Biden goal.

Biden goal cleared would mean usa adults would vaccinated sometime early 2022.

I think one many signals dems opposite gop. Instead overpromising, underpromising. Either way, realistic.

More likely, take excess capacity administration production April giving 2M-3M/day. would mean 75M doses given 'last 30' Biden first 100 days alone.

That would mean roughly 80M people vaccinated end April, +50M/month thereafter. memorial day, deaths plummeted. end July, want shot got it. labor day, vaccinated population herd immunity. you, also important distinction demands. Workplace safety regulations weekends 8 hour days one thing...

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* jinx Big facts. *sighs irish*  feel pain u hear Norway death 80s? population UK 65 million ~130mil doses would enough everyone assuming two doses ""complete"" vaccination might goal, goal certain elected officials, clearly many people around world accord official edicts. People free freedom reject vaccine, regardless public health officials politicians feel matter. Funnily enough talking someone today first jab Wednesday. 
On Friday got letter telling second jab postponed ""indefinitely"".Nottingham area.
My brother sister law vaccinated last week Northumberland. told second jab ""may June"", probably brand. SIL retired senior nurse queried statements confirmed.
In book falling wayside. first kicked employer offered 30 days free sick time people exposed covid. Within week two laziest people claimed exposed proceeded drag things 3 weeks (of course never testing positive). Shortly policy canceled everyone told use normal sick time.

Unfortunately employer sometimes right assume people abuse system. someone lives UK gotten depressed last months cause COVID constant lockdowns, fantastic news hear. can't wait life back real? Wow. really I’ve learnt large percentage people selfish. quite happy see others die go coffee want attend things like sporting events. Hope olympics canceled too. I’m sure there’s large percentage population would fine killing someone didn’t know could get away it. pretty much ignore pandemic. Credit government getting part right; it’s shame made hash ~11 months get here, almost 90,000 people died, least part incompetence.  Ireland illegal 5km home non-essential reasons, I'm guessing England similar rule  mean officials want say 2 doses 90-95% immune... life again.

Fauci others seem intent adding strings... might infect people, might carrier, need wear mask socially distance tell etc. point lives long ago Covid rule every single thing did. We’re running time though. And??? 100% agree ordering multiple companies actually developed manufactured vaccines. bets wont work out.  they're retired people, stay Florida three weeks get second shot.

I expect want badly enough pay extra week hotels. Plus good business Florida hotels. Plus means people getting vaccinated. good round. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yeah, get struck lightning too. Rational people base decisions probability probability COVID-19 results permeant damage drastically higher flu. souce? expect believe older 1.13 years? /s Shit could would. live toilet. like Oscar Grouch, disgusting. people dying February infected inauguration. Biden say doomed Americans. Nothing Biden save lives March, perhaps much noticeable effect April hard change course massive ship like United States. good? mean Brazil like 211 million people. Yes UK saving vaccines 2nd dose; rest countries Yeah well USA know East Coast already....And finally people live getting scared. What? That's herd immunity works. point vaccine protect individual; protect everyone. lot people vaccine everyone get needs effective one possible. seems like repeating instead disagreeing said. state needs doses get them. they're sitting stockpile, wait get doses start using ones have. feel needs controversial debate. specifically problem focusing dose supply used? feel necessary send doses states dose shortage states dealing problem? site barely political posts sudden theres political posts? easy solve. America make ambulance rides prohibitively expensive anyone thinking calling one must either accept children never attend college, consider refinancing home, may lead complete financial ruin. school open year. loving ALL. Also Europe 2 months summer everything open back normal.
They locked needed to. Really sucks ski resorts Based Im expecting number go Biden’s new plan, then. shall see.  ""São Paulo government"". Federal Gov. Isn’t one going around now? Wtf talking about. who’s watch now? Isnt soon speculate this? havent even gotten new President’s Covid plan yet... explanation Norway Finland well?  3 days

3 days... I'm South African, poes... run like business run businessman lost money owning casino. Maybe lived N Dakota... agree this. Sure state rural, relative population centers like college towns (Marshall Huntington WVU Morgantown). lived Charleston couple years even though population around 50k time miles homes. saw originally last report case first thought aren’t testing. people immune it? No, don’t.

If everyone gets vaccine immune pass someone *happens* vaccine work ..... like that’s going bad. 

We’re living like forever. *killed* people every day before. Remember swine flu? People still died that, one changed behaviour. Why? death rate negligible .... people still died. *you* wear mask hide home 2009? Probably eh? 

Kick rocks troll. Stabbin needles swords specialty Also many fat people math used say many nurses hire? trust UK government math.  I've seen evidence muscle better terms vulnerability fat. I'd speculate athletes greater risk lifestyle impacted couch-dwellers, although risk death certainly lower. weightlifters could highest risk longer-term lifestyle impact group.

It's tremendous shame we've done large-scale research among general population. really make guesses.  Ayy, PA finally hit 500k vaccinations. state hasnt even moved vaccinating 65+ yet. would work. None things ingredient allergic to. anti-vax anything stupid like that. allergy prevents taking two there, along medications. already that, agree, goal well exceeded. Honestly, smoking forever type hard thinking actually pushed quit. going strong almost two months now.

Guess respiratory virus pandemic good time think yourself! :)

In case, good luck you. Well, may died vaccine loved ones could get there, anyway. allergic polyethelene glycol vaccine, precancer blood condition, vaccine. AAPS medical equivalent conspiracy organization. second time tried post article group, please warned happens again, banned. Goes show not-for-profit organisation ultimate price Yeah. types people ignoring restrictions wearing masks types care someone dying due actions though. self entitled. Yeah successful vaccine rollout soften blow damage come millions people years /s despite Slaoui saying AZ wasn’t going available April. I’m confused. first time since pandemic began. everything's back normal I'm sure Tories recommence gutting it. Well, yeah. Easy math 400k already dead another 9/11 per day least month. Add 150k excess deaths approaching 700k end February. 

Never appoint reality TV stars fight pandemic. Vaccinating people higher risk severe disease isn’t matter morality deserving not. It’s simple risk calculation. high risk populations exposed, ICU bed fill up. severe cases ICU beds/ventilator/staff, triage decide gets chance survive doesn’t. means older people immunocompromised people like sister could counted lesser chance survive denied ICU bed/ventilator. 

I’m sorry sounds bit cold harsh. gets life-saving measures chance live doesn’t calculation also cold. It’s decision one never wants make.

That’s priority list vaccination doesn’t take account behaviour put higher risk. case you’re higher risk severe infection it’s one tool disposal avoid making life death decisions much can. Withholding vaccines doesn’t solve fundamental issues. focus needs getting vaccines arms solving issues immediately. worry, still got plenty time work mutations America.  Lmao weren’t. Abe member political party Suga.    paradox, hey? want see video this. AZ, directly contradicts slaoui. saying April approval there, mid Feb J&amp;J.

What matters number people vaccinated per month based volume produced. Approved many doses help. Doses unable administer help.

I see high volume approved doses comes April. like 10 weeks? guess weeks months? 

Based current info, 2Q seems like game get everyone doses. Pharmacy people say 100M doses month alone. Here's hoping bulk wants end June. What's last word AZ's vaccine efficacy? I'm still confused 62% vs. 90%...I also heard British medical regulator say actually 52% one dose, 70% second...can someone help out? Im gonna sad Monday though. like vaccinations due federal holiday.  It’s like wallops takes long time recover many people. don’t know factors yet people sick week others sick six months. virus doesn’t keep damaging it’s gone, body’s inflammatory responses might. Oh. My. God. don’t know don’t deserve this. hope COVID ends saving life, still. Best wishes friend.  fast fast enough. vaccine sound like gonna one turns everyone brain eating zombies?  Exactly hate argument. Guess 1% Americans 3 million people. every American got 3 million+ Americans would die. turn self righteous, moral crusade Alola one. he's probably better trainers even wear faster get people EU version ended better Indiana Jones game. 

&amp;#x200B;

2 1 2 rating. Im alone I'm room rn saying job/johb/jahb/jawb loud last minute confusing.

Jawb sounds wrong idk ha  Aarogya Setu (proximity tracker app) issues beginning well. fixed days, became one super stable proximity apps market. always easy scale something fast hold 20% world's population. Everyone alcoholic. Biden like sailor titanic trying steer US away covid infection iceberg, we're massive infections Trump already we'll collide iceberg. Let start saying take pandemic seriously every way. apologize anything say comes ignorant. 

I keep reading articles say “the worst yet come” “we experience darkest days JAN/FEB/OTHER MONTH.” 

What make statements? 

Are statements:
-meant keep public mindful (masks/social distance on)(discourage people thinking let guard down)
-Predictions based upon data 
-anything else? huh? interview. would prefer refused answer question? yet still pitiful number vaccinations per 100 people. One way - smokers now. proof required.  honestly would take j&amp;j AZ became available means vaccinated faster. follow years come hopefully moderna Pfizer better protection. Indian person said it, ""jawb"".  I'd even say ""jahb"" really framed question. Come Alps read us peasants, would you?  many ways feel sorry Chris Whitty, never chose man thrust public eye announce terrible restrictions people's lives. normal world, he'd man running department one would heard him. conspiracy theorists vendetta him, bit like Fauci USA...

That said, think breath fresh air. Politicians train public eye lives, yet Whitty acted professionally [with shown up. There's nothing there.  still taken back lie. care wish country honestly. take objection essentially peddling blatant lie 60%plus Indian population corona. take objection fact would trust official numbers institutions country, outright reject surveys stats published Indian government. Ah shit 😦  Yes, significant portion (maybe 10 20%) COVID patients continue report least one difficult symptom 6 months acute infection. also (strangely) seems happen mild, younger, previously healthy patients.

The good news “permanent” damage seems still pretty rare - definitely ask want deal year miserable fatigue shortness breath you’re deciding whether keep mask on. Aaaannnd... want miss greasy, soggy, cold onion strips coated soggy dough congealing fryer oil last changed last month. look like flower! absolutely right, sometimes, arent priority list avalible, maybe seniors within area want vaccinated been. People still refusing it, thus, lot going unused

There one hospital jabbed random people happened there, really like approach

The takeaway is: people jabbed, closer we'll going back semi normalcy  6 day week? Bruh there’s pandemic, vaccines administered 7 days week many hours day needed US regions saw current surge peak back November mostly already seen cases drop beyond ratio, I’d expect seeing level nationwide improvement March. propaganda Janssen American company? It’s literal fact. website:

As leading pharmaceutical company United States, focus innovation devastating diseases complex medical challenges time, across six therapeutic easy call downvoters Bhakts. neighbour farts smells bad, sure would Bhakt too. so? Stroopwafel mcflurry/s done that. shit hole. That’s risk lot people willing take, think. average nursing home caretaker aged like 25-35, one demos least fatalities. jinx saying jinx it. 🧐 mixed blessing. COVID, probably would ignored symptoms. Early stage, non metastasized, still many treatment options available. Nah fined paying extra 50 cents cheese big mac guess C. reason start over, everything know medicine suggests getting booster month later would still positive effect. forget 3 cups salt. CANNOT accomplished 4 weeks.

fucking give doses safeway then. shit excuse. even ask wrong questions. 

Maybe spend time get downvoted much feel innocuous comment subreddit generally pretty friendly.  plenty folks careful unfortunately work high risk places, like healthcare workers, meat packers  Maybe existing trial data, untainted data US trials see reason happen. S/he isn’t downplaying anything, it’s definitely relevant. Kettle pot friend! hope stay healthy dont oblivious logic assume health guarantees everyone's health future. novel virus, anyone telling 100% sure long term effects lying. second thought meant inject 5 grams mRNA, fact fuckload. long term yes. 

But made clear first dose given vaccine wouldn’t make noticeable difference months. already one year last qualifiers, guess people might perform well would last year. Two years out, qualifications really date. 

Not mention international competitions, qualifiers next Olympics. ""It's given vaccine work variant, consideration vaccine might full efficacy,"" said. 

Not enough known yet, comment worded scientific fact vaccines work new mutation. discovered certainty vaccines work new mutations, vaccine makers tweaking address mutation(s). Hopefully issue getting another similar vaccine top existing ones. we’re sitting reserve anymore. We’ve made available states order

this inconsistent actually happened. did, fact, make doses available states order. just, happened weeks ago... Wait Americans pronounce then? job rhyme knob. Imagine risking catching COVID plane go get vaccine (when live wealthy country vaccinating 65+ weeks). entitlement real... Refused vaccines still go someone priority list, whoever connections money. first responders nearby hospital, seniors, anyone else? kids remote schooling even though ""they usually asymptomatic probably die!""

I'm sending kids come back deal unforeseen issues months/years later us (who would inevitably infect) just...keep sitting tight trying avoid getting enough people already gotten it/get vaccine/take seriously enough community spread goes reasonable levels.

I understand everyone choice, know many parents absolutely like ""meh, kids fine!"" without actually knowing around long enough know long term issues might crop line. Also kids, spread to. Maybe kids fine, cough directly mouth? Mimi Pop pop? teachers aging bus drivers? Etc.

No thanks taking risks avoid them. Yea everybody screaming government vaccinating enough  thank neoliberal global order this. think factories make shoes better? go “evidence based policy” leads slave labor work conditions third world countries. That’s shit buy stores cheap— quality life built backs global south. new strains news much right vaccine approved, like March-December, dont remember reading single article new strain, like 3 new strains news 24/7. remember reading something similar happening Wuhan last year. go - don’t form opinion research. Yep UN like US worried business lives. ain't happening. Oh cool, armchair expert *and* time traveler one!

No thanks, I’ll continue follow observations doctors assume okay. Thanks shitty speculation though.

Thanks also reminder never come here. Keep up! really sorry hear that!  actually don’t like sentiment either feds rn they’ve leftist activists forever.

Might dumb q but: Jan 2020, virus still solely Wuhan, many videos coming people literally street. 

Why cases people dropping street since ever since virus became global Mar 2020? 

Did virus's lethality drop significantly Dec 2019/Jan 2020 Mar 2020? anyone heard long COVID point? journalists running stuff write about? Yes, 5 year smoker's lungs healthy perfectly healthy person Covid-19 Considering US hit peak second wave summer doesn’t much it, infections likely much lower vaccinations ramp up. That's shame, assumed mRNA vaccines magic. Hopefully studies test different vaccines methodology get better relative comparison. know asking comparison nordic nations. similar tbh except sweden, various reasons worse sure recent excess death data country choose one want look here. Water wet! cash vaccine deniers Hospital workers getting enough pay sense wage inequality strikes good idea US partying Canada still shopping vaccines

I expect happen vaccines, Canadians seem LOT risk averse Americans terms covid. mean even bluest, lockdown happy states restaurants, museums, shops still open. Meanwhile Ontario (Toronto particular) we've locked since November end sight small businesses continue suffer Amazon big box retailers get richer richer. Also tbf vulnerable vaccinated , hopefully end Feb - likely ease restrictions everyone.  anyone US ever restriction forbade go another person’s house gather outdoors, though? People living alone could always created bubbles felt need to. class, here's real world scenarios jobs program! saying locking limited capacity places business flu season? test positive get vaccine, would nothing.

It's ""doses administered"". Tell ridiculous percent nurses declined vaccine hospitals ordered enough every essential employee. Tell antivaxxers protest EVERY weekend Baker's personal residence, often without masks.

The claim half need saved second dose anything 50% distributed transit/timing. recommendation they're following it.

I disagree enthusiasm smartest always translate procurement risk departments. divide two person needs two doses? knows many would die prematurely heart issues years come. mean get vaccinated Chipotle? Anecdotally know passed away Covid people ""health destroyed"". even know means, care explain? thank HotKindheartedness93. \*Cries American\* Wishing best friend.

Structural heart damage common headlines make seem. happens COVID causes inflammation - pericarditis myocarditis - *can* dangerous someone (like athlete) every active induces heart attack aren’t aware problem. long person resting maybe taking anti-inflammatories, goes away months.

They’ve lot follow-up MRIs generally seeing much scarring abnormalities. long-COVID boards full people *feel* like heart problem tests show they’re fine. said, anyone gets COVID feels like heart issue get ECG echocardiogram rule out, happen deadly ignored. It’s already normalized. It’s human nature since time immemorial. testing transmission looking markers blood change covid prevented vaccine. seen data back yet. Would love look it.  Probably depends lot local Healthcare infrastructure systems. Moving city city every days, potentially spread virus place. 

Phoenix week Monday played team outbreak (Washington). Maybe NBA protect NBA teams, knows many regular people infected Washington players travelled US?

If NBA willing bubble authorities going stop playing worst pandemic, perhaps next best option jump queue? believe data dropped 21st April scheduled average 1M weekly doses Pfizer Moderna, accelerating May June well. Pfizer Moderna contracts stipulate 80M doses delivered end Q3, according Minister Anand, wouldn’t worried September goal. I’m little watchful whether expected 15M doses Q2 Ontario expecting happen. clearly seems dependent adding J&amp;J AZ mix, definitely excluding Novavax. whole shit total mystery box likely know full effects. COVID might associated increase strokes brain aneurysms. Might killed MF DOOM. live California completely paralyzed . . . absolute inaction. case resources, matter complete incompetence. 

I problem sending vaccines elsewhere state gets act together. Maybe spur action. Come back 3 weeks HUGE barrier. got first shot work, waited hours line cars get it, even made sure little travel urinals took Imodium ahead time due wait. again, except time mixed people going first dose...it's really impractical can't imagine many people going skip #2 due hassle. Thymus exhausted faster = HIV infection goes full-blown AIDS faster. heard Florida check residency, know buy spot. Supposedly wealthy people going outside country get shot. lazy, article says exercise makes myocarditis worse (increases viral replication rate)  both... feds lying supply, states used 70+%, feds providing support. states failing miserably. start 30 days ago then? PC more... Trumpy?

Im jumping ship soon libs get rid Trudeau ^

If I'm promised 30% change catching even going mild maybe even completely asymptomatic case I'd feel completely safe returning normal life without mask

Especially large amount general population also vaccinated make spread harder exposure less likely  Chinese intel officer got pretty deep Eric Swalwell several Democratic politicians Bay Area CA, seems like valid concern. China uses lot Chinese nationals second-generation ethnic Chinese US conduct espionage. Hard imagine would different Canada. understand many nursing home care jobs pretty low paying. know workers grueling, difficult work do, think considering much nursing homes charge residents, could definitely pay healthcare workers better. think would help retention, obviously. Yeah, wrong. get last bit though. feel shitty gain 5lb. guess short term discomfort. Quite pathetic, honestly. I'm side. North Mass here, I'm personally wondering state biggest cluster world class hospitals, universities, labs blowing everyone else water getting vaccines injected people fast released state. mean, one two vaccines distributed developed there. would thought enthusiasm would greater every level process. New Zealand, Australia, Japan, South Korea Depending long since first dose, may make symptoms less severe. lucky got made russia versions. 2nd dose, take russia version brazil? Trying living California, right we're bungling complicated bureaucracy phases tiers fucking sub-tiers many people dont know go get it. agree depression loneliness isolation real. light end tunnel knowing vaccine could get powerful lure. hand, people use exercise usualy aware body respondes. lots people never exercise might mild long term effects even notice cause never high intensity activity times used struggle notice difference. I'm young old enough at-risk group however take part competitive judo, dog sports dogs I've become gym rat rehabbing injury. I've also learning play brass instrument last 18 months, something I'm gaining large amount joy from. 

I want lung function compromised. Nope. I’m referring posts people talk already deep introverts enjoying social pressures socialize, people treating paid time pandemic like vacation. pretty common various COVID-related subs impression (only impression, can’t say I’ve done statistical analysis) person mentions they’re from, 9 times 10 it’s continental Europe Canada. Given vaccines allocated based population, doesn’t seem likely help Floridians. every health care worker licensed give injections though. read title twice realise _deep cleaned_ didn’t mean rooting bad actors. hospitalized doesn’t mean you’re severe special case.

I never said was, around 10% 20% cases hospitalized, 75% would around 7.5% 15% total cases, 70% like claimed...

Now new source says many third patients never sick enough hospitalized back usual health **up three weeks** diagnosis, report found.

How fear mongering intially say ""a significant portion (maybe 10 20%) COVID patients continue report least one difficult symptom 6 months acute infection"".

 gave 4 sources disprove initial fearmongering claim... even read links posted? mean? Title could also ""We cannot rely vaccination alone."" show us proof please make claims. eat cooked food, well done beef, salad time, maybe uncooked cucumbers tomatoes thanks reminding skip them.

i get fish valid vectors. handlers covid somehow contaminated fish meat washed cooked still virus people eat get virus, even proven virus can't infect via digestion still find way body hands/utensils got contaminated somehow enters airway/eyes etc. assuming can't get infected ingesting virus. Wait... ANTIBODIES?! /s need US. state Indiana, 6 7 times people get vaccinated diagnosed Covid19 everyday. know Indiana fastest among states. approved vaccines use technology never used vaccines outside laboratories. trials slimmed bare minimum EUA. Nobody could've said certainty last year we'd today. Scientists business speculation.

I'm hopeful advances made past year allow us nip future pandemics bud much quickly. bright spot entire mess. despite obligation so.

Are freaking serious? :/ obligation, eh? Jez, mindset here... ""Really disturbing inequity"" American slogan. believe (ethics aside) dumb idea. safe Canada. community spread.

If go Florida real chance die. Florida dangerous place.  We'll teach peaceful ways...by force! exactly new administration supposed deliver promise take office...? Yeah hopefully goes faster people think right Thanks, flippant see bothered people. tested positive... symptoms week half. Started super mild, even think Covid. tested positive figured got lucky mild symptoms. Started getting better days... suddenly got new symptoms got worse. getting better again. thing weird. I’m boat. Tested positive two weeks ago. I’m afraid thing. Right (my job) keeping cough, shortness breath, exhaustion. sure how/when I’ll able go back work. I’m Short Term right now. really hope doesn’t turn long term. Honestly pretty morbid hard system implement would one interesting commodity markets watch. Still need something works kids. cringe statement. here. I’ve lost full time benefits reduced hours I’m horrible health cost reimbursement plan (I’m US it’s obvious). don’t advertise trying baby one understands. They’re like “well don’t get injured year lolz.” I'm sorry son going this. Covid horrible disease. Hopefully he'll get better soon.  Kaaaa Meeeee Haaaaa Meeeeee............. reality is, think significant statistical studies yet long term covid effects. mean, might even experience substantial effect now, virus produced [some damage example, maybe feel completely fine 10 years get heart attack nobody ever put two two togheter. Targeting, committing to. That's hope hit, obviously problems come up. Holy fuck I'm same, except replace immunicompromise diabetes.

Out curiosity, kidney disease egfr? IgA-N, aka Berger's disease, latest blood work shows eGFR 49% (which normal gfr since 2018 so) someone lives UK, trust this. constantly lied bad things government. Cansino´s Vaccine? information? Probably smokers thinking questionable study ""proves"" invincible COVID ends nudge throws deadly downwards spiral. Damn hang guys! remember study got published. got demolished. author obvious bias, method shit.
All need know this: estimates developed John T. James, toxicologist NASA's space center Houston runs advocacy organization called Patient Safety America. James also death 19-year-old son James maintains negligent hospital care.

And comment reddit explains end paper article cites is... incredibly robust. actually one worst ""scientific"" papers I've ever read life. Here's Let's take 4 ""limited"" studies detailing frequency couple hospitals reported adverse events ""contributed death patient."" No, preventable Let's randomly pick 780 patients say represent 1,000,000 patients got discharged October 2008. 12 780 fell category. That's 1.5% 1.5% x 1,000,000 = 15,000 patients month! That's 180,000 year! What's power? Confidence interval? p-value? seems small. let's see math make number Well, one study North Carolina showed 0.6% patients died ""adverse events."" wait! look adverse events (and ones stupid doctors ""report"" contributing death) looks like 0.89% patients ended dying! die adverse event? let's use number anyway higher! say 69% adverse events ""preventable!"" sure severe events less preventable? 34.4 million people discharged hospitals 2007. GASP. Well 34.4 million x 0.69 x 0.0089 = 210,000! That's even bigger let's make even bet doctors even record mistakes. Yeah, there's way report everything. much gets left out? Let's make percentage. 50%. Double gasp means number actually 400,000! Yes, good number sensational media publish. Agreed, one giving credit ""Operation Warp Speed"" actual development vaccines. main purpose speed production distribution vaccines created, no? case, shitshow US  Looking bright side, vaccine tourism going help bail Florida economy.

Like, must differentiate races, least give dignity representing one. really, average actually raised, lot less vaccinations last sunday. 900k vaccinations per day average last week. You’re irrational. 330 million people US, 200 million vaccinations.

""That's herd immunity works."" - ErebusShark2 why? what's problem Butantan manufactured doses? inspect factory quality control something? much lockdown cost country per week? suspect paying completing vaccinations even week two earlier makes worth cost. sure, drama queen. grocery shopped yesterday mask, maybe one person whole store mask on. middle nowhere, state mask mandate. eventually, unless gonna actually enforce something, can't, drop it. it’s enough. yep beatiful sunsets USA Brazil still fucking  ""Hey there's norma-- mean white people everybody els-- mean, uhh, people colour?""

Honestly makes like two teams competing. Actually anyone (and please forgive feel far sick dig subreddits anecdotes) loss taste smell symptom loss total possible partial loss COVID?

Currently, I'm dizzy, severe headache sits place never occurred (left side only, stretching temple midline forehead, sinuses), 02 94% (normal 96-97 me, super-low), low grade fever 100.2 (My baseline high, low fever 1.1 degree me), chest feels heavy, breathing difficult, least yet, legs ache very, bad, normal sick. also cough (manageable medicated currently, sneezing fits (I suffer allergies type). also muted sense smell taste. could taste ketchup, hot dog bread on. took shot whiskey (just one, drunk posting) could feel burn taste it. also smell it. 

I checked test availability nearest date unless get doc order Friday. take son pediatrician tomorrow (well-child, one else ill), call doctor morning, biggest concern right people may exposed today. feel least bit sick got home grocery thrift shopping.I also checked temp leaving house normal leaving home. necessary trips, kept qucik possible masked entire time places. distanced much possible, sometimes store, possible. also course touched items moved stores.

&amp;#x200B;

What now? Wait Friday next week results come back reach out? Reach Health dept even get back Tuesday soonest? I'm confused, concerned, really feel tired try figure own. believe so, yes. African one everyone growing concerns lately. *Honestly, downright braceless.* People love think China lying, 10000 deaths know math crematorium, also saw satelite images, millions sim cards went down!! /s

Im living Changchun, days ago: , also university councelor giving kind information us, residency live also this... Plus also cross checking QR codes need scan getting public transportation (Subway, train station, etc). know friend lives nearby residency one new cases came Heilongjiang tested case, havent live far away.

I travelled 2 months ago Changchun Dalian, situation calmed, almost new cases China. back preventive measures place, still temperature check, qr check, etc...  contributing, yes. point whether helping fund vaccine research/creation. research proved nicotine effective prophylactic disease really capitalized upon. Don’t get misty-eyed. Like buggered-clock that’s right twice per day, thing government UK got right. Literally everything else (expensive) disaster. 

Most people strange sense impending doom, like minute we’ll find vaccine accidentally switched placebo something equally incompetent. 😳 thought Asians perfect social distancers.  Narrator: *Many much bracing.* Well ultimately it’s absolute number vaccinations given that’s point comparison, rather vaccinations per capita, latter conveys protective value vaccination. seems regard UK leading western world, hence it’s  Naive. dude, talking people bought tons toilet paper... Even though principle type thing normally disgusts me, I’d rather get many people vaccinated possible point rather fighting goes first. people complaining spent EU vaccines join procurement scheme. care get vaccine quicker. I’m hopeful week state get process efficient. Since UN decide....anything??
I don’t think Olympics happen year. don’t think exist I’m biased. cause billions costs fraction ROI. really wish could vaccinate whole family. Source Us Aussies position get appropriate data make decisions info. Maybe az vaccine would better subset population.

We something like 2 covid deaths last 3 months. Maybe military standby reasons atm? impression. assure you, Canadians aren’t loving locked down.

Americans aren’t special. We’re eager get back normal. &lt;Obligatory mention Greenland Hmmm, problem idea Sahab pronounced make argument Scotland Wales' rates low. they're NHS worse why? answer would eventually form political reason surely comes back Boris eventually. Scottish NHS also gets money due Barnett formula. media says Blacks US affected Whites. saying that’s necessarily true, often repeated line. give patients. doesn’t seem help harm them. anecdotal experience. Wuhan's initial response quite chaotic bodies hospitals took take away, read videos people activity dropping dead less hoax. See case fatality rate gone mostly due better detection lesser degree better treatment, evidence lethality virus changed. Virus mutate time, little selection pressure virus world, need evolutionary change. Yes think given track record people taking anything seriously distrusting authorities, safe anyone announce kind security unless really hard proof. 

If say much safer one person gets sort sick people decide worthless start licking doorknobs. world now. Rofl. 

Sorry laughing, people downplayed coming. vaccines seem effective preventing severe illnesses.
Considering this, probably better give best vaccine people likeliest transmit virus, i.e. frontline workers. people also easier distribute vaccine to. Yes, least initially. get enough mask compliance, maybe relax bit. No, kids almost risk. Cool, way nursing home residents die lack care instead COVID. Good thinking buddy! /s Pfizer vaccine looks like works generate antibodies neutralize N501Y mutation. mean English colonize lot world. MFs efficient. way common outcome fine. depending written.

You seem switching topics me. worth punishing 95% for

Nobody ""punished.""  feel like I’m playing variant bingo sub/in news. South Africa! Brazil! UK! Fuck it, moon variant! new variant fatigue :( know nice place Heinz 57 already table. Yeah. frankly, anyone care think? course vaccinated spread it, that's obvious. also know hedging this. would surprise generational categories like make sense individualistic societies societies communal collectivist values like say Korea Japan. post-viral symptoms like treated medical community throughout history. 

All symptoms happen viral infections, fatigue quite common, patients always treated though head. 

Not point, but... quite clearly proceed assumption always happened post-viral symptoms. okay, reason believe vaccines won’t work? Click harder.  probably cases things like happening think severity Wuhan strongly exaggerated propaganda purposes, since China's problem ours. Even there's lot Western people simultaneously believe zombie apocalypse-level China ""it's flu, 99% survival rate"" here. clearly add outbreak far control ever China.  NHS saying this, government. honestly “worrying new variant!” becoming line now, would ignore someone credentials says definitively it’s problem. issue want lead second Patriot Act type thing distinguish kind shit happened things actually protest. US horrible track record crushing legitimate protests.

""unlucky"" group protected pneumonia level not? really care since I'm probably ""vaccine youngs"" EU, means Pfizer Moderna, unless probably wait months it, even then, like choose.

Leading indicators come go further. One word






Yes know what? care anymore. numbers game we're dangerously behind. needle arm one less person spreading Covid slightly smaller chance new variant mutating wasting another year lives. America's never meritocracy, pretend now?

How fuck DeSantis tanked popularity horrifying. listen idiot. is, one dose, uses well known vaccine technology, may increase public confidence. negatives - 80,000+ dead. Trying hard possible starve children believe word current UK government says doesn’t need freezer storage one. That’s big distribution.  know joking people that. people subscribe.... Well 24 million cases recorded that’s people got tested. There’s lot evidence asymptomatic carriers significantly contributing spread. think lot 24 million people immunity. Probably closer 100-150 million. You’d think we’d hitting herd immunity pretty soon... two thirds (~67%) deaths state died ? 

In Texas, White non-Hispanic make 41% population 67% deaths seems ""Racial Health Disparity"" unless meant towards White Texans. Jus' checkin'. I'm real sorry hear pal, get shape kid....and yourself. Life best happy shell. bother vaccinate Palestinian population? username checks started US trials December 2020, unless FDA willing accept UK data think end major player. Yeah looks positive far. Id like see another week 2 data say sure improved sure. Japan really got unlucky pandemic get ignored, gets outweighed vast quantity negatives Whichever one get first. 

\*allergies withstanding think part makes less weird , often do, change furniture/carpets/new paint whatever. want normal vaccine.  killed virus vaccine.  good enough smallpox shot.


PS. Yes. old. got smallpox shot. took couple re-reads realise Tito reference. Good job. Well, duh

Honestly, meaningful someone position gall say it.  second dose Pfizer headache fatigue. Mild dizziness. paranoid brain wondering building proper immune response. bay area California limiting stores like target Walmart best buy etc. stores packed. one government gives damn apparently. making arguments based actual facts saying 'think' true?

Many things COVID make sense. less 2 years since virus discovered dismissing things based 'common sense' probably good idea. Awful Tory boot licking gammon nonce  last miles race/trip/hike always difficult! screaming ""are yet?!"" back minivan.  Actually did. Godspeed, North Dakota. Dang. tho RNA viruses mutate. do.

The media loves report stuff, worry point unknown? Cash rules everything around me....Cream get money...dolla dolla bill y'all. people florida? vaccines suppose people, really good around.... would biden coming mean US joins covax program? barely could hold human population all. basically single transmission chain, fraction contagious guy. Nobody going give 90% dose arm reported (half dose, followed full dose). error dosing technically go needed steps use non-subgroup problems (for example, younger patients). two full doses 62% first reported group. 70% pooled two numbers. Full Lancet manuscript Wait, mean track dose (so know who's vaccinated) Johnson Johnson? ok expected slip cracks either way, purpose large scale seem wise. vaccines kill people 🧐 Fort Worth? know people done this, think people 65 travel Florida whim happy stay 3 weeks. middle winter, retired people do. Also, Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan Atlantic Canada (4 provinces). enjoy mask. may wear one indefinitely stores. despite Slaoui saying AZ wasn’t going available April. I’m confused. first time since pandemic began.

According article, Dr. Fauci's quote approval We’re weeks away, months away

So approval ""weeks away"" mean doses ready used time. Pfizer Moderna, got doses days approval. Johnson &amp; Johnson AstraZeneca, may different doses might take weeks arrive approval.

I know that's meant not. could explain confusion.

If we're ""weeks away, months away"", mean we're less two months away approval March 17, 2021 sounds reasonable doses available soon maybe April.

This trying make sense said. I'm claiming truth here. one endemic virus ever eliminated, one deadliest viruses human history, vaccine 100% effective entire life vaccinee.

And naive adults lots immune memory, cost society individuals plummet. keep drinks cold Coachella EDC LV, keep vaccine cold. 

I’m pumped this! PA full control authority health-care Palestinian people, Israel. Even though work closely COGAT provides assistance local population. Furthermore, palestinians enter Israel almost daily get treated israeli hospitals (for free) PA (or Hamas Gaza residents) provides authorization travel there. Source? I'm talking smoking itself, conditions may caused smoking. rollouts come despite growing number questions effectiveness shot, last week revealed efficacy rate 50.38% late-stage trials Brazil -- significantly lower earlier results showed. rate barely crosses 50% efficacy threshold set World Health Organization, far lower 78% previously announced much fanfare China earlier month. Myocarditis “often” cause scarring, certainly can. [Professional taken duty six months hearts heal. “Regular” people advised avoid exercise strenuous activity [three assumed permanent damage.

Can't hold breath length time, get winded running steps, etc. said continental Europe, mate. UK country I’ve seen regular protests lockdowns, wouldn’t count category. 🥇 
I would agree, state seem define anyway leaves individual's definition. 

If defining smoker meant could get vaccine, think people would so. two previous authorizations gave review committee one week review time, authorized day committee recommendation, see authorization happening week. J&amp;J applies emergency use authorization 21st might expect approval 28th. idea rich countries tried cheap paying vaccine.

Probably one obvious times history idea someone making much possible everyone's interest. long cheaper paying furlough, losing tax money people working... pay it!  She’s Chinese dude. She’s Canadian. Don’t racist thats need check study it....without research wouldnt vaccine would it...they cant track it. Gotta get traitor smell drapes. knowledge already living speaking regularly doctors researchers almost year. 

Sorry realize talking doctors researchers comments actions show nothing ordinary totally line non-Chinese health officials. It’s total bs I'm really hoping J&amp;J one effective tge Phizer Moderna ones.  pedantic. currently 100 Canadians detained prison China due process. people America probably care that. mean deep fry butter. military best world logistic? say, actual hospitals medical emergency teams?

Stop army worship. guys(WHO) hold everyone accountable, accountability lies? anyways apart shooting mouths. pissed idiots. 80m non adults it’s like 240 adults. 14 already done 100m would take us close 50 percent also bumped teachers lower priority list. lost vote 2022. sound exist American accents I've heard. Go click UK entry.

It's 'o' Spanish worth. fuck old people, huh?

You sound like absolute joy. ACE2 receptors everywhere one's body, depends much virus infect body immune system, varies.

problem they're treating hospital people right they're serious cases tracking people recovered still sickness. swear, think covid can't scare more, read something like this. Haha...Israel paid more... would thought... I’m pretty right wing myself. don’t see anything he’s said racist. anything, US, we’ve underestimated threat Chinese intel large part fear apprehension labeled racist. reality nations use ethnic co-nationals espionage purposes. UK managed get rekt first half time corona, tried herd community strategy broke spears speak.

Now flipped script beating corona. Ain’t rona gonna stop Brit going vacation ya pointy twat! Even situation Wuhan strongly exaggerated - seem cases people dropping dead street, minimum, bodies found street. believe true - fake news - since [The reported this.

At time: pointed out, US outbreak much worse China, bodies found street never occurred US. 

How reconcile two facts together?  day 60 symptoms starting. still sore muscles, fatigue, random localized head aches, minor symptoms come go. lingering symptoms terrible. woke refreshed since getting it. April 2020. You’re little late internet points question loyalty naturalized Americans / Canadians acquired Chinese citizenship?? Well I'm glad browsing reddit posts makes expert...

It caused wave mental health problems idea talking about. would willing put money fact people UK actually socialising people US, due population density pub culture. 

It completely hellish lockdowns everyone end ropes. 

We many nutters occupied capitol thinking Trump secret paedo hunter masks ploy Bill Gates starve oxygen. That's scary, especially asymptomatic know working out. getting downvoted really bad, right. main difference making one shot possible clinical design. single shot J&amp;J necessarily effective single shot authorized vaccines Pfizer Moderna.

A vaccine 60% efficacy would typically accepted. vaccines far seem exceed one shot. Pfizer Moderna designed one shot clinical study, likely would authorized. chose less risky study design wanted sure succeed. people understand, kind similar MLM/pyramid schemes west. Asia, among elderly general many old-timers still strong belief traditional, outdated information era, example: believe eat one part animal, strengthen equivalent part body( eating liver help liver, eating brain help smarter etc), eating foods name similar words ""success"" attending exam etc...One beliefs believe rare expensive ingredients (like type ginseng, mushrooms, flowers tree) cure many illnesses. mean, yes, many ingredients studied proven scientists medical value used modern pills, specific effects certain illnesses, one-to cure medicine like popular belief. that, modern science found alternatives ingredients effect much cheaper, ingredients become extinct nature hunting. 



Sadly, many old people know still keep old beliefs, created perfect opportunity scammers. Usually, lure elderly people centers listen lectures give free stuff( cooking oil, washing machine detergent, fish sauce cooking salt, milk etc), basically stuff valuable pretty necessary daily life old people. elderly Yay! Free stuff! attend meeting ""because lost anything even get free gift end"". scammers use talking skill mouth tongue make girl orgasm 1 minuets brainwash convince build products high price, something like 2 roots ginseng price equal newest version iPhone it’s waste time. 

Handing vaccines efficiently possible isn’t going help take several months enough doses put dent outcome outbreak giving whoever wants one. way see impact vaccination summer targeting people need most. 

Just aren’t great job getting vaccines isn’t good reason double mistakes sabotage best hope reduce deaths. Pulmonary Embolism (blood clot lung) month ago. overweight risk category. early 40s wonder Covid last year led PE. Ultrasound legs found blood clots.  ...social distancing self-isolating? stuff they've pounding heads almost last year? Cool. Meanwhile US citizens scared signing soul satan take a...let check...A vaccine. She’s public health official who’s serving Canada decades. He’s anti-vaxer who’s making racist comments years recently failed become leader cpc party. 
You want get board guy? Lotsa exhaling gyms. understand people can't see risk article says this: “The answer: wasn’t Monday state health officials, set priorities vaccine program, authorized pharmacies start vaccinating assisted living facilities, according statement sent Times CVS.”

Are saying that’s factually false? seems make quite clear state health officials, Feds CVS, holding program start. ""In simple terms, myocarditis disease causes inflammation heart muscle. inflammation enlarges weakens heart, creates scar tissue forces work harder circulate blood oxygen throughout body.""

Myocarditis [often causes Uh, nope. He's far-right Canadian nutjob politician whose leader, today, said room party Far-Right politicians fine example one many. never going happen. article takes whole situation. isn’t specifically one variant. research referenced part new variant, may - one knows - able evade immune system antibodies variant current vaccination. CDC, full stop. Anyone excusing research trying make excuse doesn’t understand situation. would like wrong like would like wrong. However, new variants means may need new vaccine new rollout. optimism get new vaccine, covers new variants well. sure everyone finding hard grasp dogpiling like want pandemic continue going. worst time life thing going physical health right - want able continue less people suffering. That’s end it. Oh sorry clear. I'm 100% food transmit covid via contamination, point fish covid contamination, seems. thought contamination going vector fish, chances would really low, especially Japan, case count low, developed country raw food tradition means safety standards food would especially high (for example, might trust raw eggs random place world, would trust one Japan lot they're quite common dish there). way act like virus honestly surprised many board getting vaccine. wonder much end percentage wise end rollout compared states Flew Tampa epidemic whooping cough once. way out, got illl treated along thousands. overstay weeks. advocating would like point seem trouble us. 70% population vaccinated immune herd immunity. goal would 226 million people, well back normal :). 
Unfortunately takes 100 days vaccinate 100 million people 50 million may take end year back normal :( Probably obviously false negatives exist. 70% best guess. rare situation, look people joining r/covidlonghaulers r/COVID19_support sure? SHIIIIIIT...

Well thats fucked up.

I hoping something non partisan hell - bipartisan least.... money, id pay get myself, family, friends vaccinated idgaf complicated, lecture sell strange ""health improvement"" products. Prime target elders live alone live without younger family member(happened lot China, younger generation oftern went big city earn money, sent back hometown.) one hand, many Americans gone got mean there’s exponential number loved ones still living witnessed tragedy brought virus. One would hope would encourage loved ones strictly uphold covid precautions determination hope tragedy doesn’t repeat itself.

On hand, amount misinformation going around possibility people dropping guards increased vaccination natural (albeit, possibly transient) immunity actually contracted virus past may lead way another wave.

What really need public health significantly step game strong leadership inspire Americans right thing. may seem impossible even we’ve witnessed 2020 alone, Trump President (technically still 😒). Maybe naively holding onto hope. want tragedy end. like optimism. think logistics setting meeting giving members materials review push February, hope right. I’m curious also! Early friends ex partner would say things like “I’m worried getting sick I’ll survive” like even now, friends lamenting parents young healthy enough DIE... like don’t wanna get sick even week... let alone months damage potentially.  Wait, what? absolutely data scientific evidence show muscle growth constricts space internal organs rather muscles growing outward? spouting personal theory?

I'm pretty sure complete utter rubbish. looks like booking charter flights get everyone great idea think people need vaccine too. enough discussion human economic cost students missing full year education, repeat even still delivered online. would suggest envying Taiwan Vietnam instead. knew done it.

The really dreadful thing people thinking vaccines. Far it. others said, worst yet come. Purely many people think pandemics apply them. Same. I’m 30s, extremely high risk. two younger kids high risk. family hunkered whole area pretends like isn’t pandemic. I’m hopeful vaccine shot sometime summer. nothing going change kids vaccinated. then, stay home everything computer. feel bad schools never went virtual Fall community continuing fun things see windows. mask usage though, can’t risk it. This. read lot asymptomatic people showing lung scarring. anyone checked kids supposedly impacted greatly? sincerely wondering looked kids lungs symptoms happening kids too. got covid around three weeks ago. symptoms generally mild bike lot. instantly felt tired bike, particularly go short bursts speed. luckily, find biking often enough see able progressively bike longer. hopefully temporary would love resume normal biking capabilities :/ family member bit slow. (he got sick kid). picks masks ground takes home! I'm taking care father who's dying lung cancer. came stay dad, person comes over. Talk giving life family member. I'm immunocompromised. I'd hiding till vaccine. pray. Kinda irrelevant US doesn’t even vaccine reserve anymore. Here's logic ... J&amp;J execs thought single dose efficacy near 90%, think would started 2-dose trial. thought efficacy single dose would less 70%, think would done 1-dose trial. 

Before mRNA vaccine data came out, would figured efficacy lower end range, I'm optimistic now. 

In words, complete guess. surprised hear kids issue, thinking maybe spared. actually felt worse first Pfizer dose. week later, body aches. #2 sore arm several days, headache next day Vast majority?

I least bit surprised even majority US gets it.

They massive supply waiting dumped. Chances efficacy results lower 2nd dose boost rival existing two, they'll pivot double dose strategy soon can.

AZ also gaining approval rough timeline, J&amp;J eking plurality likely, 4 approved vaccines rolling production line, going hard one get majority, much less vast majority.

J&amp;J game changer, another strong tool belt. weightlifters could highest risk longer-term lifestyle impact group.

What makes think this? would think participate sports require much higher levels cardio would likely face biggest long-term impacts. save asserting evidence lung damage asymptomatic patients cause negative clinical outcomes, can't prove negative. show me. feel like it’s western states stupid “western states pact.” !remind Age based fatality risk : (Females expect fatality risk bit lower these)

You mean according article 90% India billion cases India ? 

Stop reading print scroll worst lefting attention seeking websites. barely news sites let even cited boat me. talking another runner friend telling even though chances recovery good I’m worried affect ability train kind race future. average person sitting couch doesn’t worry. loss smell/taste weird. went outside night smell air reason hit harder tasting food.

Mine started come back bit, return seems slowl remember reading early pandemic this. would catch less often caught got hit harder expected age range stuff really like felt need make one, two posts wishing harm family. Must seriously triggered someone. Ah, damn. Hit nail head Right (vaccinated today) think basically protected before, though understand mental relief. take couple weeks first dose much you, really protected full couple weeks second dose. Lots people gotten infected sick first dose. keep careful, keep wearing mask. etc. Even stop feeling like mask matters covid, keep wearing screw face recognition cameras. least plan keep that. Heh. That’s funny I’m sitting thinking I’d rather az j&amp;j , real reason I’m lower risk category meh  makes feel better, sister Covid early March (confirmed pcr later blood test). employer testing everyone periodically since went back office. tested positive antibodies week, meaning contact virus again. never felt sick guess imune system still recognizing virus! gives hope I’m still clear well sicker much higher antibody count. surgeon general top doctor? shame, lol. need healing essential oils! plan involve ""we"", moreso well connected securing enough wealth influence well what's coming. see coming, many confidence ""we"" ever make it, plan well ""I"".  It’s race clock. Efficiency save lives long run. 100 million 100 days sounds good gonna absolutely passed many millions Well shit, flu one year knocked solid week another month fully recover mid 30s time. Thanks sharing, super interesting. episode good lmao Lol. Look person . Basically untested foreign vaccines safe .
Except AZ none cilnical trials 

Even AZ done phase 3 trials India . tested western countries. 

You free question BB vaccines efficacy numbers. plain racist blindly trust vaccines never tested India. I've heard story lot. Several members family(myself cluded) ran scenario. chronic bronchitis. get sneezed end wirh sinus infection 2-3 week consistent coughing plague. vaccinations, better. It’s hard petty, every shot victory humanity. I’m you. think misunderstanding me. athletic person greater chance side effects covid couch potato. may greater chance side effects prevent athletics couch potato (non-fatal) side effects prevent sitting couch.

I would certainly welcome new data, everything COVID I've seen essentially useless comes judging difference. fact, new piece research posted /r/COVID19, that's usually top comment: ""we really can't read much this"". wonder kind person would downvote that. mind, person dangerous public health. true- one ppl! * UK. Sickest I’ve ever early January, 2020 living NYC. Got tested influenza B. 2 weeks terrible sweats, appetite bad cough. 4 weeks major symptoms gone quads aching 3 mile run, prior running 60-70 mile weeks. 

I’m frightened getting Covid despite low risk experience getting flu. Aside showing empathy basic human decency? lot, guess. This. I've practicing BJJ 10 years now. one younger grappling partners who's 27 peak fitness got covid lungs got massively fucked barely go 3 minute roll. :(  i'm 47 want NONE crap. ""President-elect Joe Biden’s top health officials confident U.S. enough Covid-19 vaccine doses meet goal inoculating 100 million people 100 days.""

Ok good finally hear actual goal, awhile couldnt figure meant 100 million doses(50 million people) 100 million people(200 million doses). Losing sense smell taste honestly worst all. able enjoy cup coffee brutal.  Giving money states slow rollout encourages corruption. Want budget? Slow roll out.  real? really connection here? case people Covid 8 months later another entirely unrelated health issue someone trying connect dots? little bit ‘a certain amount population doesn’t want get vaccinated need scare them’ going on!? Yep, said would likely last least year.  way know much longer that.  that's said. contagious whole time? first 2 weeks? mean I’m angry vaccines distributed moral basis, can’t deny I’m glad people getting vaccine matter are. Every vaccination statistical dead end virus, need less that. I’m happy keep careful risk overall lessens via rich assholes getting vaccine. assuming comorbidity pre-existing condition that's necessarily case. What's number one comorbidity SARS-CoV-2?  Bamilanivimab doesn’t appear show benefits either way. Vaccines closest thing “silver bullet.” 35 here. 40lbs weight, ashtma, weed smoker, also athlete mountain climber living 10 000 feet resting heart rate low 50s. good health, perfect health. sick 3 weeks March rest town roomates tested positive. sucked. Finally got better though. early November migraine motion sickness lasted 8 days. history mild migraines last less day never motion sickness. 


It insane. function. dont know latent affect covid new infection completely unrelated. guy could read upside back pick truck. writing phone gave motion sickness. 

Ive battled depression years. level brain fog I'm dealing right intense. I'm hard time playing games thousands hours 20 years. Forget getting job application without falling asleep comorbidity necessarily pre-existing condition. What's number one comorbidity SARS-CoV-2?  Yes. correct I’m sorry happening you. So, symptoms (3 months later) caused long- post-COVID cancer?  too. I’m concerned long-term effects, happens years realize millions people COVID-related disabilities? It’s nightmare scenario. charge 30 days ago  isnt really logistics problem considering us nearling million doses per day uk 200k 140 per minute 24/7. us doesnt rollout problem, idiot problem. know one thing sure virus: everything power live pandemic without getting it. I'm fucking weird ass virus. I'm dead set everything power get vacine stupid virus decides find me. Gosh sorry you’re midst it. symptoms come go too. body aches worst! 10 days sickness. Prob 5 days mild, 3-4 pretty yucky, one really bad day. hope symptoms taper soon! Eat drink take easy. No, I'm going put you, one making potentially dangerous claims without support. Please provide one two high quality links dismiss lung damage appearing CT scans unimportant. Take time, I'll wait. Pre-built not, got hospital running 5 days. I'd like see it.  What's issue here? People 75 supposedly begin sign 2-3 weeks, CA. Some, directing emails 75+, continuing outpatients hospitals, contacted well within month, unlike contacted County Health agency. major pharmacies supposed vax nursing etc homes. CA. See. I’m scared of. best year, 7:20 miles, dropping 9 10 feels like - thought feels like losing something I’ve worked hard able control life. 

Like, I’m competitive runner, won’t ever be. But. thing usually feels good possibly losing scary. also 25 million confirmed cases probably 2x people asymptomatic. Considering seems large majority cases coming fall/winter, help move toward herd immunity. key issue far appears locality infection. infection limited upper respiratory tract symptoms resolve couple days, little reason think Covid much problem.

If 30% vaccinated people catch Covid loss smell, fever sore throat couple days, think issue. knocked 2 weeks, coughing, difficulty breathing etc., would worried.

As vaccines rolled millions, probably know more, although I'm holding breath. likely ""well hospital cares, whatever"". like far. False equivalency. didnt data six months ago. happen workplace, though. New Year, got exposed, you’d get PTO use sick days. Starting 1st, use sick days. course *that’s* got exposed. SARS also 10% death rate. steroids may well hope rescuing patients death.  J&amp;J started phase 1/2 trials second ""booster"" shot Land free die COVID, overwork, poverty, etc. mean, far better Canada Britain moment. January 15, Canada vaccinated 48000 people 6800 new cases. That's ratio 7 times many vaccines per new case.

Not mention UK registering 3 times many daily cases Canada per capita, despite much stringent lockdown.

I'm Canadian, amazing Canadians blindly accepted media story slow vaccine rollout been. much better countries (most even started vaccinating), incredibly grateful going vaccinated 90% world, rather behaving like bunch crybabies done next week. Sorry bud, people live like forever. mask wearing least end 2021. wish freshness me. Onions garlic sweat smell like three month old dead rat. Bananas soapy. Peanut butter moldy. 
Got covid march, lost smell July came back, completely altered everything. bad 

Still? bad? I’ve seen UK generally well. support HK accepting immigrants, expert economists predicted outcomes Brexit short long term, powerful finical recovery, recent giant tech investments London etc. long symptoms stay mild spreading others, worry much.

It spread entire workplace super early testing even really available (we originally thought something else later tested positive antibodies). Thus far, nobody recurring symptoms. possibility spreading someone could severe case worry far possibility unknown future complications mild case. Problem, course, isn’t thing “getting with.” Natural immunity finite, people getting reinfected. doctor made quarantine 24 days. 10 family member last tested positive additional 14 after. hope doesn’t become common. infections = hosts virus = virus replications = chances new variant develop. bright side, base mRNA vaccines retooled currently approved ones myriad available targets antigen presenting cells immune systems. okay least time being. What's concern African strain? tuned lately. Fauci thought worst case 300 thousand thought flooowas 400 k seems happen illnesses too. specific COVID. I've instances flus time exhibit symptoms months recovery. stomach bugs resulting imbalance microflora causes GI issues like colitis. heart palpitations case flu couple years ago. still gone away.

 Basically, COVID illuminating details immunology even experiences we've quickly forgotten glossed lives. Next Olympics without set location 2032. They’d probably refurbish much buildings since decade passed. Paris already building 2024 LA already building 2028. I’m sure it’s age chronic migraines (or both) actually drink copiously (more drink home, like work holiday party shit) - I’m solid couple days. maybe every couple years, worth anymore.

I’m sorry get crappy hangovers too! husband doesn’t get hangovers it’s super unfair. much struggling many back training, it’s still sketchy. Public guidance pretty minimal well although suppose gyms technically violating max number people room yes, understand good Brazil terms 'ideal world' able provide everyone best vaccine factories focused that. course time dreams reality practicality :) Vaccine production scale like that. 100% remote month, turned one day week. fine, came shut door, wore mask around others insisted same. still coming occasionally needed entire time, seemed work well. Eventually one day turned two, turned five again. Surprise surprise, got COVID someone work. two weeks two days (including hospital visit), worked half days week that. least felt bad it. told keep track delivery food wife ate, turn receipts, reimbursed me. spent close $500 delivery, really nice. yes, newbies. person lived many years least 10, accent becomes unforced, quite pleasant mix sometimes. we'll live it. 

Masks social distancing permanent. Lockdowns happen regularly. Businesses reworked retooled. Large gatherings banned indefinitely. Basically, way live changed forever.

Humans good adapting. done, done Thank &lt;3 that, unable breathe crushing headaches pains fatigue. people area saying refuse get it, I’m ready jump in. Gimme shot!  Maybe included caveat effects may result aggressive treatment necessary SARS, would better. Health officials looking closely deaths nearly two dozen people receiving first dose Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine Norway.

A total 23 people died within days receiving first dose, Norwegian Medicines Agency announced statement.

Of deaths, 13 nursing home patients least 80-years-old apparently related side effects vaccinations, according health officials.

Dr. Sigurd Hortemo, chief physician Norwegian Medicines Agency, said press release common side effects like fever nausea “may contributed fatal outcome frail patients.”

The Norwegian Medicines Agency says cannot rule side effects vaccine contributing serious course fatal outcome patients serve underlying disease.

The Norwegian Medicines Agency National Institute Public Health assess reports suspected reactions.

The Pfizer vaccine requires two doses separated 21 days. must stored ultra-cold freezer, thermal shipping container, refrigerator.

Amid vaccine rollout offered real hope countries, global death toll COVID-19 topped 2 million Friday.

More 35 million doses various COVID-19 vaccines administered around world, according University Oxford. article says IOC’s position either happens 2021 never happens. Oi! Looks like you’ve spotted one wild. Make appear large, loudly yell “biDeN cRiMe FaMiLy” spook flip side. 32 million doses already coming. month two gotten healthcare good chunk 65-75+ reduce hospital impact ton. hospitals go back normal elderly risky vaccinated, see reason country doesn’t go back normal state. ridiculous, whole sub acting like miracle cure based absolutely data whatsoever. Indeed data viral vector vaccines promising there's lot reason doubt vaccine label ""game changer"". Hope ok, also need talk. (Day 17) stupid believe pro EU articles predictions reliable economists predictions, former predicted UK bundle flames within years, latter UK benefiting (to extent) exiting. far seems experts right, funny that?  ... tested one dose... mean going nearly good toddler regimen.

However tested one two dose regumens, might great candidate willing get one dose *now* get booster dose later point time supply stabilizes. Also people enough stability life plan second dose can't stand thought getting shot twice.

Chances effective vaccine us care seeking greatest protection. still possibility could end better AZ vaccine use stabilized spike protein human AdV26 vector mean early on, MMA dude posted insane photos f’d got covid. Tracheotomy, weighed like 130 lbs. you’d thought alone enough persuade people take seriously. Yup still seeing arguments local fb pages (schools, dept health) friends. It’s depressing. hate this. 

My parents took many damn safety measures 60, unemployed anyways able lock pretty hard.

2 days ago mom tested positive. fever days ago, mother too. father getting fevers come go. tried isolate 3 us 1 bedroom apartment.

So many neighbors take precautions still threw parties family gatherings apartment complex.

None appear sick family gets shit could getting worse later on? Got certify people machine may need licensed morticians Yes. literally went China check quality control. Thanks worth peak Don’t lose hope! tested positive, super mild symptoms, honestly back feeling great. Trust you’ll okay, take vitamin take care yourself. hangovers equal flu, didn’t last long Glad hear it! read, Israel one quickest country administer vaccines population. know vaccine silver bullet seen decline death rate number cases? multiple version N501, seem mutate independently.  12 per day maybe 14 Isn’t crazy US see this, “Japan shut 50 positive cases?” Things could different us. Wow. happened?? I'd say 60%-80% likely. we've seen different trials really depends define ""success"". Sounds terrible, I’m sorry excuse, telling is. Ideally want keep Americans Canada. seems like, still day, see American car plates driving around everywhere go out. Thats bro science. Stop making shit up. hi POTS too, doctor suspects i’ve whole life got worse got older. gets worse 16 slowly gets better people after. think persisted α sicknesses multiple times younger thats really done in, worst fear js getting covid making POTS worse, i’m already like are, post covid, ever get i’m scared wouldn’t able breathe walk hopefully come way name variant....  30% symptoms, severe Covid. Oh no... 2020: groundbreaking Vaccines Moderna Pfizer distributed US leads world vaccinations: “Trump nothing it.”

That's awesome found cancer - hopefully early enough intervene! Another uphill battle, wish strength fight speedy recovery. closer 1920 tbh Two days???  would like hear whole story!  That's amazing.  Clearly interesting info this.  Please tell all. :)   Yes, although reinfection doesn’t seem common. may change new strains coming around. least, it’s something look forward to! doubt. sadly becoming common story.

Allright then. Keep secrets.  [Vaccinates Portuguese] took medication changed chocolate tasted bad (not diet pill side effect) drove crazy. can't imagine losing taste. nobody using office, maybe company saves money leasing office... means loses office! supposed cheat wife then!? Oh Biden way worse.  We’ve seen pro athletes hit hard this. Even “healthy” shell themselves. made feel better lol love username there’s still group people believe hoax Chances are, depend live. Restrictions gradually lifted, includes mask mandate. certain US states, restrictions go away much faster others. 

I think going normal summer, that's think. Good advice. ready see headline, least article cleared things age range that. yes.. magical;; rib cage...... add mass effort expand lungs breath magically increase........... even infection raging it. completely agree. mom vaccinated soon it’s available risk group day available age group don’t really “risk factors” wouldn’t available age yet anyway, family members telling us we’re stupid getting it, well least don’t think government wants track every move α “microchip” (even though already know everything us location α phone computer) would make develop something. it’s sad people listen conspiracies religiously. used really conspiracies almost fell α hole it’s much take in, people believe conspiracy theories want feel like know type classified information, coming someone used believe them. admit, one people vaccine actually seemed plausible timeframe.

It truly seemed inevitable, still believe without vaccine. never said “I wish could get get with”, understand unspoken language “flattening curve” essentially saying “everyone get it, don’t want everyone getting short timeframe”.

I’m way saying inevitable wasn’t preventable. However, way United States whole treating it, zero way going stop spreading without something dramatic occurring.  Silver lining flu deaths infections way down. girl worked got it, went away came back work week disappeared. Next time see said started cough blood COVID damaged lung tissue. need get steroids counter act it. acute sensation necessarily better. analogy disorders make hypersensitive sounds. hearing better, bothers more. divining “all infected individuals” number talking infected individuals know about. 100 million people 200 million doses, 2 million per day.   fuck, back thanksgiving pretty mild stress! Statistically outlook grim subreddit wants believe. Personally I'd unsub go thru it, mental health. hospital saying 2 weeks, take people isolation that. Random nearby people fine. long delivery boy called paid knows someone same. true. US, countries seem care remember 'doctor' flew Africa medical theories 'demon semen?

Wait what? never heard that. Hang son.. 
I heard long lasting effects smell taste, mean 2-4 month long lasting. years, even worse forever. Please tell slightly exaggerated isn’t scientific study supports words smell come back going freak right NOW.  father died two weeks ago grocery stores mom working restaurant industry ask would still alive taken stronger decisive actions Congress bothered support American people.

It's national tragedy finally hit home me. feels like living failed state. dwell enough early days - critical moment pandemic.

As Australian, that's truly shocked. small timeline key events:

* [Feb Australia declares pandemic inevitable, preparing national stockpile fever clinics around country.

* [Mar NY's first person person spread found.

* Mar 5: NY, home nearly 20mn people, overtakes Western Australia, home 2.5mn people testing.

* [Mar Vietnam's covid jingle goes viral.

* [Mar prefer keep people cruise ship due ""liking numbers are"". Combined slow broken testing, strongly points numbers games protect markets polling.

* [Mar (?): tweet outrages me, disinformation/downplaying effect worldwide. hampered many country's perception time.

* [Mar one retweeted president. America doomed.

* [Mar automated high volume testing approved, American testing screams ahead Australia.

There's coming back start. really isn't. obviously doesn’t mean enough say she’s sitting season foregoing salary. Yep :/ Damn OP, I'm sorry hear that. doing? 

Something similar happened husband. Oct 31st, visited parents. seen since March seen anyone 14 days could go visit them. Welp, Nov 1st, literally next day, father law starts experiencing symptoms. gets tested, Nov 3rd, gets results: he's positive. go gested. Got tested three times span two weeks time negative. daughter fever 5 days husband felt super weak dizzy 6 days. negative right? 


St end November, husband develops autoimmune disease called ITP. Basically, body killing platelets know why. doctor says one knows causes thought virus kind mutation. 

Well, he's meds since recently get bone marrow biopsy rule lymphoma numbers getting better medication. (Still waiting results).


I know correlation equal causation, damn, can't help wonder undetectable COVID developed it.  shit mutates every two weeks since beginning. every variant noteworthy Theres weekly nfl nba stars testing positive coming back two weeks later without showing signs fatigue anything. one two extended absences least plan seem care, unlike trump. Almost year later I've brain fog literally every. single. day. also had/have dizzy spells, vertigo anxiety like crazy first 7 months, gone away I'll get day every two weeks. whole year life I've completely different person operating feels like 50% capacity. Good luck, honestly. takes 3-4 weeks get two shots, time build antibodies. lot deaths happening people infected shots even started. I’ve heard 50%, but,like said, “success” defined many ways. Locked 90% comments already offensive jokes. better. people freak title, referring lockdowns future pandemics/outbreaks excuse lax enforcement airports. already natural choke points nearly deserted. violations rampant willfully ignored. perhaps find useful work whilst we're it! 6 months post Covid fatigue horrible. Also, food used love taste like metallicky trash. force eat two months ago, learn like foods would normally hate. body-builder MMA feel personally attacked. Makes sense international travel, mean countries already require profile shots determine entry anyway Yup let's make list residents ordered age weight occupation make sure everyone knows place list prove place list available short notice case someone ahead misses appointment. problem. still are. Except AstraZeneca fanboys turned J&amp;J fanboys.

Also everyone weirdly points J&amp;J vaccine much better stored regular freezer. Moderna vaccine already use. there's literally nothing ""game changing"" vaccine. Don’t believe doomsday hype. Literally almost everyone fine. Reddit full sensationalist ninnies I’m expert, here’s understand:

Even vaccines don’t prevent reinfection, still created immune response within body help prepare COVID result much manageable, milder case symptoms get it. 

The vaccines effective. weren’t, current technology new vaccines made very, quickly. 

Like viruses, it’s likely human immunity increase time many people getting virus recovering + vaccinations. Part reason COVID worrisome novel virus, meaning brand new humans. hadn’t ever it, immunity built it. Yes, it’s also contagious unpredictable flu seems spread affect people, information available public right now, seems reinfection rare vaccinations effectively make virus much manageable even people get infected afterwards reinfected.
 
We definitely won’t live lockdowns forever like someone else suggested. US people accusing government fault. (In way, shape, form defending administration here). state, much changed lockdowns went on. masks, people everywhere could wasn’t locked down. blame lot too. due respect, statements like reason less less people complying guidelines every month.

There’s way people gonna live like permanently, even could argue epidemiological statement, it’s right thing do. I’m saying selfishness, it’s practical. Nobody talk to, even ones staunchly pro-lockdown, willing stay home rest lives, someone 300 miles away who’s immunocompromised pre-existing condition doesn’t get Covid. 

A lot people already reaching breaking point still complying guidelines vaccine coming. experts shift rhetoric back “there’s end sight”, amount people complying gonna drop significantly. 

Also, we’re gonna able save everybody, even keep guidelines years decent compliance. point, effective treatments vaccine, it’s gonna become issue risk assessment vulnerable people families. bad muscle pains, mostly legs arms. equivalent going 5 hour walk took month go away. never got bad enough walk hurt constantly. issues happened 5 months post infection hope soon turn corner. J&amp;J traditional vaccine like AZ Thanks! I’m glad he’s okay too, he’s amazing guy. yeah... evidence patients affected, knows? bothers day, though idea time. “a cold!” :( volunteered vaccine roll centre uk past 3 days. would say one centre roughly 1000 people day, old.

Unfortunately though police called day “mass gatherings” due enough help queues old people outside cold hour. 

The roll came around quick considering leading least 6 months 2 things didn’t expect come across. 'succeeding'?  worrying. reasons get vaccinated ASAP. claim sacrifices needed minimize possibility covid “easily avoided” completely wrong.

How hard wear mask socially distance around people members household? That's enough time China convince people came overseas. Yea would great. I’m actually relatively surprised haven’t fallen least now. Especially early main focus nursing homes long term care facilities. account almost 40% deaths.  bunch people min-maxxing. love put points strength forget intelligence resilience. know people died ... everybody silly it... Maybe dingbat. I'm Dalian now, would imagine still strictly following health protocols. However, Shanghai week new years got asked show qr code leaving airport. Temperature scans minimal. Sanya, temperature scans hotels that's it. north definitely taking things seriously. south? That's another story. Remind two weeks! advisable stop quarantine least 14 days, wearing mask closed spaces necessary. PCR reports may come positive several weeks symptoms cease, unlikely spread virus two weeks. Claudio Zupo, Dani Khalimov, Donato Sabia, Attila Horvath, Olympians regain maintain form long run. point, nope.

There probably would *some* deniers along, need many doubt sort thing requires cover story, pretty common knowledge  No, new case numbers fall practically nill, absolutely can. I’m throwing away shot. I'm glad soon son law ok. hope patients get infected. heard lots people North America January, one knew I’m glad know now, US GOT step up.

💯. US rest world (except NZ, Australia East Asia, seems relatively well). Antibodies take couple weeks ramp shot. vaccine isn’t viagra. March expect precipitous decline. way get data manner things directly measure: data extrapolations estimates. add pentagrams devil circles carpeting good measure incase anything comes calling back  1918 Flu Epidemic thought caused massive uptick narcolepsy. Covid may also same. (There indication narcolepsy actual autoimmune disease some). ""After exposed."" Australia example, quarantine scofflaws detained immediately today Australia's infection rate rounds zero. firm hand authorities everybody won, though went along kicking screaming.

Folks, could please put lid many toxic comments posted article? already are. Especially take California data. Missouri (where live) already almost 60% 7 day rolling average late Fall surge. Add vaccine much better soon. absolutely correct.

One caveat **everywhere** needs get shit together like FL cut red tape. Otherwise end lots travel. Right you! live small town nobody really cares all. I've heard elementary school, middle, high school elementary school best protocols. really saying much unfortunately. masks, little distance, etc. I'm single parent. also health condition could decided slowly (or quickly!) give temporary (or permanent) paralysis degraded physical mental functions time wants. interested risking 4th grader bringing home enough worry future. guarantees either way condition covid. Back like October people sub pushing favorite vaccine candidates based read blog posts news articles them. Looks like shouldn’t quit smoking last month lmao  Yes! read article literally said “if you’re still going grocery store - probably stop.”It’s much contagious. Daignault says research reveals five factors raise female*, overweight, history asthma, elderly. multiple symptoms acute phase infection first couple weeks, "" said.

Important three four times prevalent women  kind choice encouraged. literally thousands studies covid ripple effects. industry (medical research) literally non-stop since March last year. last two sentences far base, they're laughable I'm stricter enforcement, government pay people enough stay home also convenient way get food. Plus need people work provide food, involves facilities make packaging food, facilities make package food, transportation, storing/stocking/organizing inventory, selling/distributing inventory. trying get doctors take seriously symptoms, appeared COVID infection. Better part year later, still gaslit. Still plan treatment. someone currently positive extremely mild symptoms....fucking fantastic ton european soccer players (Ronaldo, Ibrahimovic, Pogba among many others) caught covid I've following see affecting they're best trained athletes world, Pogba complained harder play full 90 minutes now. seem fine, anecdotally. could world class medical teams wait hand foot well. toss coven witches good measure   think whole world woken vaccine-escape reacting implications. Weirdly never fever. cough lasted 3 weeks got shortness breath 2 weeks turned bronchitis.  understanding would bump road, wouldn’t stop us reaching herd immunity eventually vast majority population immune vaccine aren’t either fight vaccine gain immunity die off, eventually virus runs people infect. inability spread disease doesn’t really seem like end goal vaccine, really good side effect (I’m expert understanding) symptoms absolute nature may vary person person. logged register frustration people seem willing give everything makes life worth living security. I've charitable mitigation measures/masks/capacity limits they're necessary (given state hospitals), really angers people seem want retain risk perfect zero. Stop fucking clickbait vaccine shaming. Anyone gets shot arm helping.

These ridiculous ideas proving asthmatic 50 year old less deserving 30 year old fisherman wrecking distribution. 

We understand long term effects. Get needles arms. suggest COVID 19 Survivors group Facebook. You’ve got enough people basic data analytics lasting effects look (and don’t) like Looks like oregon well, one top % doses distrubuted. washington california seem falling behind many? There's billion people milder symptoms.

Without data prevalence, anecdotal fear-mongering. like winter 1919. Good hopefully I'll able get vaccine soon. I'd careful mask wearing, social distancing handwashing since February. serviced HVAC systems work previous Thursday Friday including replacing filters. believe exposed. Monday evening low grade fever. HR gave thermometer monitor temperature Tuesday morning. hit company threshold 100.4 left work, went home, tested next morning. Fever broke four days later. day notified tested positive. symptoms started day later. Chest pressure, sinus headache, fatigue, upset stomach. important waste time downvoting anything wrote.

Yet post again. Got it. Murphy, serves secretary Health Department formerly Federal Chief Medical Officer, said Australia’s borders could stay closed another asked ABC Monday whether holiday-starved Australians might see changes 2021, gave grim think answer probably no,” lot population vaccinated, don’t know whether prevent transmission virus.”

Absolute madness. Sorry hear that, hope found r/dysautonomia helpful people.

I think I've since around age 11, suddenly developed altitude sickness. I've explained people, POTS much like altitude sickness…only sea level, every day. Yes, 30 days refrigerator, longer freezer guess. don’t know, kind like anonymity wearing mask. knowing people’s colds things mostly blocked. says first found states counties last year.

Seems really clickbaity title new variant found Bay Area like something new world specifically Bay Area Fucking exactly. risk *at all* little research effects?? ain’t tryna weak lungs shit age. point missing Santa Clara Co seems epicenter Covid Bay Area. That's due population behavior, testing. kind issues, exactly? wife COVID summer weird lingering problems—achiness, fatigue, allergy-like symptoms. wonder else watch It’s 2 months still can’t smell, even little bit.

God damn covid rash itchy fuck  Man spending much time though idea time. “a cold!” :(

Yeah, back one knew anything. got sick around time decided hang sick friend (and knew sick), thinking ""what could possibly happen? never get sick"". Luckily Covid, bacterial infection. brutal. breaks heart.  Translation: make sure check everybody’s racial social background giving shots. Wow, learning this? Holy shit. would think endurance athletes especially. may average objectively milder symptoms, they'd fucking notice. couch dweller notice much losing 20% lung capacity. would mean end age grouper competitiveness suffering like hell whenever try lift pace. thought one !!! COVID March started. I’m still experiencing weird smell distortions. Like laundry soap smells like peanut butter garbage/malodor smells like onions. It’s weird, I’ve gotten used somehow tho Happens best us mate. one escape reddit content moderation seems. stayed political bullshit. states shutting giving shots. got (pneumonia) 65th birthday. 

I treated quickly, still went bronchospasm effort greater walking moderate pace. next three months. 

I’m waiting vaccine. Half assed lockdowns mean? 

We haven’t actual lockdown once. Interesting CDC says 30 days fridge puncturing toss check page Vaccine vials may stored refrigerator 2°C 8°C (36°F 46°F) 30 days vials punctured. [This one. 

I don’t know linked properly. article. PS: don’t live New York - live north Michigan suburb many grocery delivery services area. course know many areas don’t that, I’m relaying name article 🤷🏼‍♀️  Imagine getting covid BC U went eat restaurants lost sense taste consequence well can’t get 90 days now

More like *least* eight months. media publicized three-month study hasn’t publicized subsequent studies that. Really frustrating hear repeated often. still that??? Midwest OH said screw nothing really came ours. Sounds good nachos. cited peer-reviewed evidence low 19% Pfizer. :-) Surely bias scientists would expose it. trained scientist. interested scientifically-grounded rebuttal. Spanish flu disappeared itself, sars kinda same, viruses went extinct vaccines, every virus different story, don’t know happen. BARBECUE SAUCE could states like article said.

The thing changing Wednesday rhetoric coming certain governors. Oh may start focusing task hand rather next election. I'm glad Chicago New York pushing open go back normal. data seems indicate 10% people COVID-19 develop long hauler syndrome. current number cases worldwide 95 million, means 9.5 million people dealing it. 

Yesterday, 200,000 new cases US. 20,000 long term effects, pulmonary COVID toes cardiac psychoses. 

Masks. Distancing. Clean hands. can, get damn vaccine. really big deal? China vaccinated people less 100k cases. got done useless debate fb dunce says he'd rather entire world wait enough vaccines +90% effectiveness let countries get less effective vaccines well. Apparently, people would get apathetic less effective vaccines would greater damage. tried convince need utilize vaccines can, matter effectiveness rate. 

If millions people attitude, going long road end this. unbelievable irrational people's understanding pandemic wreaks havoc is. study posted wrong? Someone inform they're mistaken.  may intent, get enough people vaccinated vaccine-skeptical nations subregions rely herd immunity? people won’t vaccinate.

Not I’ll turn whichever vaccine becomes available me, would dearly appreciate good protection careless people. strong leadership go lot people think. Really sorry hear that. 

Mind ask kind cancer? wonder latency since know blood cancers tend develop shorter duration. Idk Think real tangible changes Biden make result lot real payoff. Enrollment affordable care act trump administration it’s advertising budget significantly cut. People knew existed best time enroll even worked. Biden simply throwing money advertising go getting vaccinated increase amount people go &amp; get vaccinated system place telling to. mean I’d rather risk people get first general government Biden going taut 50 million people vaccinated end April, simply embarrassing. pace would need two years vaccinate entire population. Nobody press asking question. proud failing protect people?  💀💀💀
Your comment wins. like sauce;-; go eat Why? There’s shortage years now. can’t imagine people gonna flocking towards healthcare seeing we’ve basically left dry whole thing

I know many people leaving field. I’m planning too. see getting worse America everyone evil it’s third world country wife's dose said good May 21st. would 4 months. CKD really sucks wish best.


To circle back conversation covid.. exposed? symptoms It’s fiancé. used smoke well mild case (muscle aches little congestion). flu week, lost taste smell etc, healthy am. early 30s. I’m huge conspiracy theories, many friends smokers used mild symptoms. China huge smoking population compared US country well terms death rate. Maybe invented virus shown mild smokers? don’t know, saying Hey Sabrina, little finger wiggle make disappear!!!

Been isolating since March well. Nice see others safest thing possible 💗  intelligent person. unfortunate people life capable explaining fact today. Pretty sure point (I really sick last March). can’t anything without getting breath anymore since lost health insurance can’t get checked out. company called immunoprecise antibodies Vancouver looking developing cocktail 4 antibodies targeting different regions covid genome. Preclinical trial results end January really hope sort approach help 2021. common comorbidity pneumonia followed respiratory failure. Imagine that... disease causes pneumonia respiratory failure causes people die them... know moderna could kept fridge 3 months. 16+ eligible. dont really know kind allergy tests I'm 100% sure answer that.

If helps, however, back-scratch thing covered ton basics. lot animals (cats, dogs, birds, etc), bunch common foods (egg, fish, nuts, dairy, etc), bunch native plants, lot stuff. 

I actually previously blood test done mild dermatographia, showed three allergies.

They actually ""stop"" test early give antihistamines wash back off, coat topical, bad reaction. 

I actually go back another test want dig deeper things original. I'm sick 24/7, I've actually started finding correlations particular foods, sickness.  grandmother would say that. don’t know sport you’re following guys seem unphased it’s absolutely wiping guys confirmed positive. Maybe you’re confused guys held contact tracing purposes, that’s COVID/DNP cases NFL doesn’t publicly differentiate. I'm doctor anything doubt Covid could cause issues.. please aware anxiety cause pretty much own. Speaking experience, I've small issues slowly snow ball anxiety creating sorts strange random symptoms. huge battery tests, doctor found nothing wrong finally suggested anxiety causing it. accepted learned coping mechanisms anxiety, symptoms went away.

This may experience definitely speak doctor already put mind ease, wanted mention doctor told realize many strange things anxiety own. 

I hope feel better! Interesting, thanks info. I’ve extremely disappointed virtually everything cvs/walgreens involved pandemic, much talked ‘testing every parking lot’ vaccine roll out.

Good WV Facts matter. Misplaced optimism helping anyone. Yes. Smoked teenager, quit year ago. I’m 23 now. wife never smoked, drinks water, runs 4-5 times week. I’ve never seen sick before. Good fck em. disgusting slave labor exploitation students barely adults force make bullshit commitment even turned 18. goal right high number vaccinations. It’s hands deck vaccinate vulnerable. It’s slower require special logistics drive though vaccine general population. general population advantage - stay home way. group done much faster obvious reasons. 

I feel bad folks want cut line front true high rush. Maybe that's around late January-early February last year instead. flu shot, too. sicker I've ever life weird generally really get sick immune system seems pretty strong overall. hindsight, always wondered caught Covid. Really weird trash people cheering vaccines pandemic. last person told wants get covid get fattest person know.

Yeah, could see care Seems spreading argument high r0 probably sound Meanwhile, Arizona, almost one vaccine number cases fucking roof.

Whee. US less vaccines per 100 population though. US 3.37 per 100 UK 5.42 per 100. Also rate number going also smaller. January 11th 15th US went 0.99 per 100 UK went know happened got extremely sick March. Worst I've ever felt. throat felt like melting neck. nose burned breathed. chest hurt like crazy over. arms felt like going fall off. head felt bruised symptoms. lasted month. ended hospital sent home.

I go back hospital April would go away. got first Covid test came back negative. got better 2 weeks later week got really sick again. ended back hospital May another negative covid test.

I've getting extremely sick every week since then. almost year. Never got positive covid test. Every week sick hell. enegry. Nose burns. Chest hurts. Arms hurt. Sweating like crazy. Head pounds. temperature always good never lost smell taste. I'm even sure covid whatever happened completely ruined me. 

I hate it. want die point. good days since originally got sick back March, insane. almost year. know happening me. doctors ER walk clinics say everything good. Specialists see Covid. know anymore. I'm losing mind can't take anymore.

I know going this. think needed rant get everything chest. storage requirement Moderna... neighbor - 30ish, mother 2 little ones, needs liver transplant thanks Covid. husband sick mild Covid symptoms late summer. fatigue going fall, spent Thanksgiving Christmas hospital Covid attacked liver destroyed it. 

The long-term effect health unimaginable me. careful - 60 yr old female already bad liver - makes incredibly paranoid. meant get that. understand well getting vaccine gonna happen everyone gets it? What's % people problems covid  Strangest time find living in. Stay safe everyone. know live tyranny. 
 
^[take ^me ^with ^you] say go back hospital COVID. think COVID slashing lungs ribbons post-COVID lung damage remains body attempts knit ribbons back together issues arise. Exactly. Chicken pox leaves risk shingles old age. 
 
Who knows covid cud come back fo bite us yeah  underlying narrative same. Healthcare workers overworked underpaid.  good point. know someone perfectly healthy peak conditions got COVID lost 20 lbs fast, maybe 3 weeks so. sudden. one could seen coming Holy shit, 35% symptoms 3 weeks. agree May reopening timeline, although lower death rates 2-3 weeks medically impossible indicator lags infection time span. least two months see substantial decrease deaths. 

Note Biden’s plan 100M vaccinations 100 days around 20% population least one dose. 

Agreed 50-60% Ohio population resistance Covid end April. enough push daily cases way, way still good enough tell general public totally forget masks distancing especially UK variant dominant. August might reasonable time totally back “normal”. Okay real question. Gonna taking person standardized test soon. Hate masks cuz fogs glasses, I've also gotten doses Pfizer. cool nose stick long vaccine card proof? wish could. They’re shoving us back classroom kids vaccination even though it’s right around corner 😔  Reproduction rates virus? 

Decreasing infection rates necessary herd immunity, don’t yet know vaccines affect infection rates. seems prematurely assuming rates go people vaccinated.  Man y'all sad It’s really hard look data realize differs media message. long held respect peers intelligent person, someone get facts takes emotion out. covid suddenly people calling stupid found didn’t align people orbit fed media. skeptical narrative never matched pure data. It’s torture clearly understand much overblown people around call murderer simply questioning media isn’t straight public. Yeah, Mods, someone put 'misleading' flair post? word ""Efficacy"" means something specific, title going lead confused people, confusing misleading information wild.

It great Johnson Johnson vaccine appears work well, fantastic news. Let's wait phase three trials talk well actually works vis vis preventing infection. serious. even close factual evidence based article. sensational headline facts back up. 


Where stats ( amount positive covid cases 40-50 vs many experiencing ""debilitating"" problems).


FFS gullible hell. 

Just FYI 0.16% covid cases age 0 60, resulted hospitalization. 16,000 admissions per 1,000,000 cases. line: getting summer telling people keep summer 2022 met widespread resistance.

That’s hard line well. point, 50% vulnerable population protected hospitals longer risk overrun we’re done this. entire point telling everyone stay home hospitals - *not* avoid getting sick overall (although stay home long want personally don’t want take risk). 

Masks suck, stuck around December places like grocery stores &amp; hospitals wouldn’t outraged. wouldn’t like it, wouldn’t wear anywhere else, I’d deal places. I’d offer beat ass stupidity first responder, covid fucked 27yr olds heart bad can’t much walk. Fucking morons another layer say couple deaths directly caused vaccine makes news people could less willing get it. it’s bit balancing act. ideal world couple deaths happen people aware chances occurring minuscule doesn’t reduce willingness take vaccine that’s reality.  noted now, unless *specifically allergic ingredients vaccine*, CDC recommends everyone, including people history severe allergic reactions foods, animal dander, pollen mold etc., still get Pinch nose metal stripe breathe out. Sounds like blessing disguise Ya agree certainly better options doses go to. 

But weren’t going used atleast people got vaccinated.. bs reason made up. That's actually stayed. isn't. See reply comment misinformation regarding hospitilizations. absolutely 0 preventative measures taken.  I'm tired trying explain that. Really am. College football National championship game, Ohio State played. 11th. semifinal game 1st. Ohio loves football, Ohio State trumps NFL. people state could resist throwing semifinal NC game parties, super bowl won’t breaks them. take prescribed less. condition for. feel high, trouble.

The problem meds take edge pain. Never makes go away completely. Mine never has. hope normal life.

Oddly COVID-19 might best hope. many coming chronic pain issues research done rapid pace.  US pathetic sequencing capacity using much has. order couple hundreds low thousands largest states, per week. 🤷🏻‍♂️ I'm starting think Moderna one especially rushed without adequate testing. First sentence article “Many patients, especially 40 50 years old” Hunger Games. Vertigo concussions. chronic vertigo caught covid. 10 people particular lot concern bad/contaminated batch. pause applies batch continue vaccinate using doses different batch. operator said Sunday test-taker Tokyo disobeyed exam supervisors' instructions cover nose, despite told 7 times total. 

I feel 7 times plenty generous. Like said, it’s awful did, apology still necessary. yep, bodies tend bigger there's surface area ace2 receptor form on. Contrary folk wisdom, you can put price life can’t denied people die COVID good innings.

Ah yes, 'going pub important people dying.' Trump already pathetic, vile human being. need pin news article him...except helped create health crisis resulted lots dead bodies. 

From South Coast Air Quality Management District Sunday issued an [emergency order](http://www.aqmd.gov/docs/default-source/covid-19/crematoria-limits-suspension.pdf) that lifts restrictions crematoriums least next 10 days, saying it’s meant help backlog bodies created air pollution control agency limits number human remains may cremated month protect region’s air quality.

The rules enforced regulatory bodies like South Coast Air Quality Management District type environmental health safeguards Trump opposes. Ignorant idiots became first responder last January caught covid December, still suffering heart issues. could picked worse time enter profession lol....even better caught covid working Christmas eve   Yep. daughter born half heart 3 open heart surgeries. live bubble. Happened father law around month COVID.  IV steroids knocked he’s good ever since. said autoimmune response.  literally compared 5-6 weeks actually allow vaccines kick “lockdown forever” 24/7 vaccination centers would require money operate. need hire people, figure logistics, rent building/space, make sure it’s operational high level. think would amazing, also costs lot money. That’s money states local governments don’t moment. won’t funds next stimulus package Biden gets passed. Either people say enough enough agree slavery freedom.

And shifting goalposts new variants every day, I'm worried latter. mean, every society's got problems. looked up, tell america's got *school* shooting deaths next several countries *any* shooting deaths

my father's japanese lived japan. yea, problems, they're working lung damage first thing that's checked though? agree symptoms line lung damage posts say symptoms due lung damage. read like unexplained symptoms. assuming people went doctor check basic things like lung xray. make ""the best world it""  many morons think “u didn’t die? Covid ain’t shit!”. Ya man, fact I, 27yr old distance runner/firefighter can’t slow walk 2 months covid perfectly normal, problem. friend’s got March (doctor NY) meat still tastes rotten her. 🤢 every one kids would tear eat like chicken nugget.  
As far concerned freaks nature. Well thought-out animated graphs. Stark truth. I'm happy downvoted. glasses hopefully tip useful others. aware myself. Thanks I’ve gotten lot better. week ago couldn’t walk 10 feet without getting winded, today muddling around house bit getting winded. hope it’s persistent. really hoping get excel use regiment drop weight year. Gonna hard can’t breathe. understand you’re saying, idea vaccines go waste patients left end day utter poppycock. Everyone planet needs vaccinated. people witb appointments gone “leftovers”, anyone available consume leftovers fine me. mad people make fake statements make feel righteous, maggot. Every society something bad good it. Doesn’t make whole society messed up. So? doesn’t change genre. KILLED FLOW Usually talk lockdown/the effects covid businesses/etc. saying it'll affect people first world perspective- least, seemed way comment. Guess I've seeing many people making bad arguments lumped them, apologize. Absolutely. Bruh covered nose. tad harsh? I'm advocating carelessness? Stop stupid accusations. Smell downvotes stick couple pieces glass storm door.

Stuff sticks like it’s made it. Pocket? I’m saying Italy earlier China. I’m saying it’s obvious don’t know full story. fact acknowledge Italy early also means acknowledge could came China Wuhan Military games. certainly think it’s likely originated China though. 

No reason hostile- I’m simply pointing can’t trust admin anything Covid anymore trust China. Evidence based practice lel...
And mechanics physicists...


Philosophy: theory science
Engineering: introduction scientific publication
English: write homework.

Even though changed profession still remember those...

This argument based authority.

You singlehandedly assumed current state knowledge isn’t scientific enough...
Peerreviewing thing, yes, actually reassuring certain studies repeatable/have repeatable outcomes, acknowledging phenomenon well, part happened.

Sars cov 2 isn’t old enough fully understood coming years, even though don’t exactly know affects us long term already know does, peer reviewed manner(two scientists samplesizes close 100 came similar observations), totally warrants actions spread.

Please don’t go on, initial comment fucked especially regards verifying comment answer to.  stop COVID? flu kills people too. Gotta eradicate well. Same, they're paying really well considering, still far cry paying enough never leave house pay everyone else take me.   fully protect Americans got vaccinate planet unless want take away freedom travel countries return. Ok, that's fair answer, probably the""right"" answer. harm kids greater risk virus. type answer looking for. Hearing much,"" f world, I'm good"" know kids protection. Yep, current rate take year vaccinate everyone nurses work covid floors n95s/face shields able keep getting it. comment blatant lie. covid December, loved run could run 10miles without stopping lifted weights too. Now? slow walk, I’m 27yrs old heart rate goes 140 walking. Young people please listen: immune Yeah, heard guys well. Hopefully things get better getting 300 400 cases day population 1/14th Ontario's looking around 5600 Ontario's population.

Yeah, that's really we're 300 actually matter think flu.

I get it. We're 10 months millions died around world. Hospitals overwhelmed. Lots ""recovered"" people left debilitating symptoms organ damage. anyone still think flu? 🤦‍♀️ Same. started new job couple weeks ago... COVID tester local school. Dude you’re anti-vaxer. Give up. Nobody ever going take seriously except anti-vaxers. inevitably going happen country part. Dakota's probably 60 70% people it. Pandemic legit basically Belize open test within 72 hours departure, Costa Rica well. Dominican Republic Mexico don’t require tests. Ecuador requires test. Bahamas requires test. USVI require test. lot places without issues getting except negative test within 48-72 hours departure. actual study actually controls age ethnicity: actually found effect worse &lt;70 flu strain 2 years particular deadly compared flus, remember one caused quite mortalities. it, symptoms. Muscle pain, aches, malaise, that.additionally also loss balance well, loss appetite. 1 episode intense nausea oddly dint vomit. Covid new virus people might feel severe symptoms even symptoms all, since immunity it, immune response slower fly. suffered back November felt fine December. Two weeks ago started trouble breathing randomly falling asleep. Back hospital find quite possibly permanent lung damage. No, course not. While, person Asian descent living West, appreciate resulting bigotry racist attacks increased astronomically wake fanning sinophobia, believe Covid-19 origins investigated. HOWEVER, lab origins crap debunked reputable scientists virologists ACTUALLY studied virus - West nonetheless! don’t like standard lab package offered me. Sometimes manage get doctor order additional labs and/or tests dig deeper specific test. ask specifics know name test it’s available regular people. I’m educated labs prove longhaulers symptoms yet, believe stories real. scares me. Won’t delay kill people? excusing behaviour. sympathy one fault really.he deserved got, can't disagree that. I'm 36. Got June mom. got minor cold. Loss taste smell set 3 weeks later already feeling normal. can't fully smell taste 7 months later. Taste mostly came back smell probably 60% best. lung problems anything else though. measure things like fatigue study like Chinese study accounted 63%? Numerous studies shown high levels fatigue PCS. rate continued respiratory disease similar studies. new onset diabetes. CKD 4.5% higher Chinese study. rate hospital re-admission post-discharge death much higher UK study China study. I'd rather fatigue dead...  worse economic crashes. Fewer 10 it, almost symptoms. I’m absolutely terrified. No, didn’t study vaccine way. Shit mate tell need communicate, yeet fuck outta stupid nurse. to, awful. nose pads something unstable mask makes glasses wobble. astigmatism, vision changes constantly constant wobbling. person Ryquell Armstead fresh college guy supposed starting running back. gets anybody agree seems like bit lack urgency. Sure know people need time holiday there's fucking pandemic on.

NYC kept pace yesterday. state VA seems take every Sunday off. totally unclear vaccinations going 7 days week 24/7 supply.  31 years specific I’ll take three please! THANK YOU. tried everything people said work walk around blind I'm public take glasses wipe every 15 seconds. I'll see works go store later. 40% hospitalizations 75+ year olds, 65% 65+ year olds. still pretty age based. nothing, everyone freaking Alabama's National Championship celebration, looked like Mardi Gras. week later stats dropping fast county nearby Jefferson County (where Birmingham is).  Young people invincible. College town  Exact reason told dad dicknose bit safer. happens Americans refuse take COVID seriously. There’s excuse this, many people serious health issues rest lives.

Seriously, people. Wear damn masks. Get face mask glues skin top, preferred medical student wear mask day. people say dish soap anti fog sprays people use glasses. glasses work retail, wear mask glasses 40+ hours every single week past however many months, NEVER nose stick mask. 

There excuse. Battle Royale manga least actually assigned student random weapon. MC got grenade antagonist SMG. don’t think article intends prove anything one anecdote, merely highlights it. real evidence would found studies scientific papers. antivax people grasping literally anything convince people get vaccinated. take advantage good natured scared people. haven’t already decided myself, I’m search evidence convinced anything I’ve seen far. one who’s opinion can’t changed. ate vitamin gummies wouldnt issue one finding weird rise prominence Norway low overall relative number vaccinations considering European countries large elderly population like Italy Germany vaccinated million people without reports cropping up? observance Martin Luther King Jr. Day, COVID Data Tracker update Monday, January 18th.

Really? data web site need day too? believe countless people second doses booked odd anecdotal evidence people dying know infected month ago average. need wait longer see results Dang, would paid extra $10/dose vaccinations. shame somebody can’t named decided locking vaccine supply doesn’t matter hoax. 

Thanks mods filtering truth. yes, B.1.1.7 202012/01 20B/501Y.V1. naming alone turning big mess. loop family friends acquaintances older cousins help older kids? parents personal zoom tutoring times per week niece nephew four states away. One kid per adult different rooms. Like 15-20 minutes work time history math homework problems, chat/gossip/dance around room/other break, another chunk work. classroom apps equivalent sharing blackboards. better one one attention, couldn’t zone like group.

It freed time sister husband get house stuff done too. private businesses don’t require go nuts. conversation going maskless matter Spring, government *private* requirements damned irrelevant. guy pretty adamant fully intends disregard private business ask event mask rules still place.  COVID last year ( around October ) 

Never issues...was locked house. pretty active, job requires move around lot. 

So still know day COVID false active daily good way counter COVID?

Either way want go quarantine again...the anti-soical locked house really screws up. coming gamer...don't really talk anyone online one apparently knows mic 😂  12 months here. Doctors closer understanding why. We've ruled active infection, cancers, autoimmune disorders, heart brain damage. Current theories dysautonomia, inappropriate immune response renewed viral loads, neuropathy, vagus nerve issues cardiomyopathy. Nah, little nuance. Doctors estimating hundreds thousands vials go waste, that’s reported. don’t know exact number hospitals aren’t reporting number. damned damned don’t. assumed wasn’t calm given based argument scientific partially premisse, i’d say don’t know ad hominem arguments always strawmanarguments

Noting tone unnecesarily hostile neither ad hominem strawman. need learn communicate ideas properly. Ad hominems strawmen two different types logical fallacies. Try nurse thinking scientist

And background what? type healthcare all? I'd bet anything paying lip service healthcare workers frontlines, nurse says something disagree with, sudden feel need disparage entire profression. Again, grow method aquire knowledge, prevent pandemics pandemics correctly evaluated ended

We aquire knowledge pandemic? Lol. research studies because...? wait SARS study epidemic, source learn disease control. argument completely several datapoints apparently know jack shit peer review peer review repeatability datapoints

This statement shows know jack shit anything we're talking about. That's ""peer-reviewed"" means. means reviewed peers. C'mon lmao. I'm starting wonder so? Don’t need peer reviewed data make correct statements equate actions taken?

Yes. Like said, already lot research showing precautions work. wait end pandemic see did. Likewise, need wait end pandemic see many individuals initially infected beginning pandemic fully din’t think indisputable phenomenon saw three times comparable cases vital info people make mind wearing wait 4years warn longterm problems mild cases till larger sample sizes, sounds right

You even know arguing sentences barely coherent times. even know trying say atm run biggest pharma experiment ever, vaccine less year? really think thats safe? peer review hasn’t finished matter yet...

Are anti-vaxxer now? studies *are* finished. Pay attention. corners cut, wnen phases research, technology use develop vaccine development years. production vaccine fast, production vaccines medications slow situation shows happen money placed healthcare haven’t reached yet might fare better encounter indoctrination..

I even know trying say ain’t got work rn? Interesting... explain me, would start clincal trials hands full comabtting pandemic? think mentioning already found data? differentiate seeing phrnomenon explqining phenomenon...

What even talking about. saying begin checking people post-covid we...don't time? There's plenty money funneled covid research, team researchers needs conduct study particular issue. Again, there's reason can't start research right instead anicdotes there, better get wider clinical picture. like beginning pandemic initial research showed asymptomatic spread 80%, cases tracked studied, dropped 69% could drop learn more. So, similarly, number long-term damage post covid may lower incidence study cases. *study cases* determine whether that's pandemic isn’t overcome new datapoints possibly devalueing earlier datapoints arise

So? implying research may corroberate preconcieved notions? already research shows need wear masks, idiots choosing to, showing *might* get long term tissue damage deter them, especially there's preliminary advocating research already done, thread comments mentioning two observations samplesizes around hundred, showing phenomenon 30%40% percent, don’t want acknowledge still anecdotal data... two different independent sources coming conclusion, wait repitition base action findings

A hundred representative sample size. use reddit threads really, newspaper germany trying study still process… failed

Trying what? makes one wanting determine common phenomenon accumulation phenomenon ended...

Are impression impossible adjust numbers? Lol. Let's stop counting covid cases pandemic ended yet. can't get right amount cases end, let's wait! meanwhile new strains biggest damage happened past 5 months whilst summer numbers down, first reports longterm effects came summer, yet argue fucking nurse value cases showing similar phenomenon...

None anything weather study happens disease passes. Yes, 100th time, I'm nurse. pathetic trying use honorable profession insult. know what's going you. obviously drives insane lmao. people try talk another person's education people *under*educated need feel superior way. Agian, grow would tell valid percentage mild cases turnt nightmare still people contributing datapoints?

There already thousands people covid almost year. That's huge sample size pull from, there's reason ""wait end one wanting determine common phenomenon accumulation phenomenon ended...

You know talking stop arguing? incidence observed around 30%-40% two individual groups, however wait till pandemic actually able determine actual incidence base actions incidence...

This entire paragraph raving nonsense nothing said. need research. source stated need research. studies literally say conclusion research needed. idiot advocating *more* research. good argument, I'm sure realized point, ego pushed double down. Go read. get people roll pandemic - Gym 50people one class sometimes foggy sauna. One person class covid pretty reasonable assume high percentage get infected! Band-aid across top nose, top mask. It'll stop fogging. 26 nice try. Also sure you’re time work. I’m work currently next 14 months 🤷🏻‍♀️

Also already COVID last July. Fortunately bad. Outdoor dining CA still happening, idk it’s banned it’s definitely still happening. drove beach yesterday literally normal day. even flea market set China acted whole lot faster US did. ever gotten antibody test? IgG/IgM markers know right, want lie. 65 population gets vaccinated everyone pre-existing conditions vaccinated, hospitals stop getting overwhelmed. 50M figure cover it. Memory B cells unlikely decay. bigger issue virus mutates way B cells memory lose efficiency. one possibility like flu memory cells really react time give much help takes three five days get going. think case though. Also suggests viral persistence. short, immunity good chance life. Measles similar thing viral persistence promotes long-term immunity improvement antibodies time   Dicknosin’ answer. Yes are. 100% is. s/ mRNA's Covid Vaccines interfere DNA? thoughts? 


See article won't:  Glad works you. virus give good god damn equitable are.

Everything else sorted dust settles.  I'm SoCal friends there. understand there's better excuse party Tide game.

My county, San Bernardino, CA close even worse Los Angeles. we're hold super spreader event (King Hammers). yet, even cases SoCal starting fall.  Big boy!! I'm sorry hear rough. Thanks advice others, wishing best! &lt;3 Same, ordered pizza day particularly mild weather (it first try ordering take since whole thing started) went pick saw booths inside full people without masks waiting pick food (indoor dining closed one thought wait outside). watched owner (with mask around neck) lean breathe pizza cut it. 

Personally wasn’t worried getting Covid particular instance know there’s way less chance getting surfaces ingesting whole thing made say, “screw that, I’ll take care food next year” Yeah never really went much, need learn wear mask 7-8 times. India people wear masks, lax towards corona. try best wear mask whenever need go never really thought go out. ridiculously binary this. still coming ""it's flu"" camp eejits? read 1/8 ""recoveries"" Covid die within months, massive number suffer debilitating lung (and damage). stop posturing. look like fool.

There’s difference house party bar Mardi Gras themed event giant Mardi Gras Celebration A+ troll good idea theory others look like someone wearing incorrect mask. It’s funny switch rates absolute numbers makes U.S. look worse.

U.S. death rate lower UK, Italy, Belgium, Czech Republic example.

 It’s within 15-20% rate Switzerland France.

Yet U.S. singled special scorn Guardian kind failed stop nonsense vaccine stopping spreading it? Scientists say actually tested for, actually true. 

There vaccines prevent getting disease still allow carrier, preliminary results Israel (the worlds best vaccinator) lead say vaccinated spread disease. troubling MHA go-to excuse people assholes. American speak much stupidity three lines? feed troll, reddit think rest world lot pressing issues hold accountable Japan’s allegedly abhorrent work culture/mental health treatment (I say allegedly since I’m versed enough specifics enough confident it) lot population vaccinated, don’t know whether prevent transmission virus.”

And doesn't? Keep border closed forever? isn’t PR. believe idea behind delaying second dose that, may mean less protection individuals concerned, it’s effective whole population level. you’re protecting people end.

In sense it’s like wearing mask. doesn’t much directly protect you, reducing transmission get it, protects everyone else. check Google later want, I'll rounding simplicity. 

1/120 people die year, roughly.

365 days year, round 400 120*400= almost 1/50k people die every day.

42000 particular vaccine, assuming started giving injections 30 days ago, would expect see least 23 deaths.

As far could tell though giving three different vaccine there's probably people that, know older people likely die younger people. article reading vaccine said deaths people 75 older. find statistics Norway, U.S.A 75 year old 3% chance dying year would use higher number year percentage gets even greater.

So 3/100 (instead 1/120) times 42000 one would expect 1200 deaths per year group 4 per day. media found 23 them. 

We sanity check answer discovering 400 people Norwegian nursing homes die week oh, that's counting vaccinations anything since historical number. Since vaccine go people 75 going nursing home patients well two dying even higher.

Tldr: lots older people die every day, happened get vaccine first deaths made news. Also later news articles noted additional quotes Norwegian Health authorities that's roughly thing, would expect lots recipients vaccine die old  Ask around.

In future I’d expect two jabs regular boosters everyone. 

The question right whether one jab “good enough” situation expect - hope - be. 

All guessing game I’m obviously optimistic. Normally, yes. COVID throws conventional wisdom door. think people zooming boobies now. Yeah, used really like Coke Zero whenever I'd order Chipotle, something combination awesome.

Nice, totally make want even fucking die every instant step outside. roll still im basically ""married"" training partner. privates week instructor. get good training helps stay afloat.

It's wrong, different based society culture.  Covid vaccine gave effects mild Covid (the one least). Got it.

The headline implies wearing mask merely right, clearly lot people see must view it. mask covering *the bit face breathe through*, **not wearing mask**. need get thick heads. think getting herd immunity here. Let’s remember didn’t testing lonnnnnng time many places still don’t. leaves wide margin error regarding case numbers . also know even many 50% cases asymptomatic mild symptoms didn’t even realize virus. major lack accessibility antibody tests - take within couple months contracting accurate. 
All factors contribute ACTUAL case number. number idea high actually is. effects accurate calculation CFR herd immunity level. 

I’d willing bet it’s least 3x think . “No evidence of” “can’t rule out” aren’t incompatible statements. You’re acting like definitively found that’s fact happened. patients ill enough normal course disease could killed them. Trying determine counter factual maybe would lived slightly longer side effects vaccination near impossible determine. may bad long curved. anymore since Deflators lost golden boy Brady. RemindMe! April 4, 2021 will. whole industries economies depend them. dont see restrictions permanently. bad US consequences anti-maskers.

 NOOOOOOOO 1984 MUH FREEDOMS!!!! Lmao Bad bot. coworker mine went exact scenario doctor told still quarantine away SO. case mild doc said would keep possibly getting severe. much want bet super bowl like 3 weeks cause shoot again. Yeah fund curing diseases spend 3/4 trillion dollars year war machines instead? I'm talking mass vaccinations date. Two weeks CVS Walgreens say ""fuck anyone get vaccine"", there's zero excuses keep restrictions. honestly that's generous. Realistically restrictions end anyone 50+ get vaccinated. Waiting 20 year-olds overkill. Yea yea summer 2021 boutta movie ur still ur basement also investigated, maybe he'd visited DC past weeks...
Just saying... news. Water wet grass green. 


Yeah know china really shit bed. one surprised bunch senior citizens lined around corner. That's thought too. I've everything right try protect loved ones. everyone around given chance protect themselves, I'm want do. least animal models vaccine significantly reduced viral burden lungs allowed persist nose upper respiratory pathways. low viral loads overall, especially place causes bad outcomes (lungs). 

The data come slowly, here’s hoping even viral load nose doesn’t lead infections.  Amazingstoke. 

Probably can’t fucking read either. suggest everyone download latest Vaers report.There 36 Covid -19 post vaccination deaths latest report numerous reports allergic reactions different kinds side effects. Download report read yourself. Lol “you socially distancing partner, dare over!” couples live together really got beginning. insanely wrong it’s painful, least somewhat right. Ugh. Peasant.

I get bullshit purest wellspring gibberish:

Twitter. vaccinations 100 days

No, no, Biden’s plan, Trump’s. He’ll better this. end pandemic coming. accept it. hope best two! work grocery store surprisingly got family member. honestly expecting one bring home seems otherwise. far congestion sore throat too. fuck going 50% reduction cases reduction deaths? Deaths lag behind there's multiple time gaps, first vaccine build immunity deaths always lag behind infections 1-2 weeks that's statistics show decrease fair unilateral restrictions, discriminate based age, give people less restrictions first line due age. That's slap face young people set world fire save old people. Good. Wow yeah that's great idea, keep manipulating public selective information, wonder compliant trusting public health authorities. vaccinated end masks social distancing.

Not everyone getting vaccinated day. rollout going take several months. Things go back normal community whole ready go back normal. personally get vaccine. useless non-contributing comment ever.

""Well **WAS** going say stupid shit I'm lazy read article, thankfully comment guy saved embarrassment!""

Like, anyone suppose give fuck something going say telling us anyway going say it, didn't. 

Fuckin hell people ridiculous.

Thanks advice! ambitious goal, considering many countries half people refuse get vaccine. Hope they'll achieve percentage. Good luck!  truly hope correct. think people used pandemic excuse invite annoying/crazy relatives holidays choose spend time friends. don’t think seeing huge NYE surge lot restaurants bars closed. lot Super Bowl gatherings private homes, think might see surge.

I've several long conversations people think like this. every debate try best research come facts oppose conspiracy theories, sometimes evidence find online falls short (doesn't convince them).

I would love find someone knowledge subject, someone common sense discuss matters unbiased manner. anyone interested? Daycares are, better worse, essential functioning society now. restaurants things like takeout outdoor dining, daycares ""distance"" business model.

And sure, I'd loved policy interventions. None happened. 

All life risk. Life 80ish years risk die anyway. decide manage risks. I've literally seen people reddit say let kids run around playgrounds, either. Imagine 15 years kids end stunted growth shame parents exercising kids. 

Everything risk. question risks weigh heavily. Unrelated close air return “other” room. Otherwise you’re recirculating air rest house. get diagnosed heart condition? don't, sorry. bought box couple years ago getting lot smoke neighbouring forest fires seen need smoke literally cleared next day. 

However, used several times around workshop one mask that's well year old still works perfectly. 

I'd willing bet N95 mask need discarded nearly often would believe. mask filter, filters replaced get clogged, would take LOT microscopic particles clog entire mask. 

Also, examined along side methods, there's nothing special it, layers material breathe through, wanting protection, go cosmetic aisle pick thin makeup removal pads something similar stitch two normal masks together couple layers between, cut fit together nicely overlap seams.

I think important realistic situation, apparent optimism one biggest drivers pandemic. Mold still grow mask used 15 minutes. amount moisture allow mold growth.

Rule thumb case is: keep reusing mask starts feel itchy uncomfortable. that, throw away replace new one.

From experience, could probably 2 days row mask starts feeling gross. targeting 70-80% population vaccinated May death toll way higher anyone predicting.

There way get high. get clip 2.5M shots day, get 75% early August. assume two shot regime. J&amp;J get lot done fewer shots, assumign one shot approved. worry ton Anime Twitter another test taker said even offer take separate room refused. don’t answer think government screw up. think old saying applies “You lead horse water can’t make drink it.” However, healthcare workers see people going “lives,” numbers rising higher, making lives even miserable. **They quit.** one trenches save people’s lives, screwed. 

Not places need locked though. I’ve looked CDC’s website, aren’t many cases it’s contact traced controlled don’t see reason restrictions. However, also failed too. 

Hopefully, next admin implement smarter strategies risk assessment give guidelines states/counties mostly given tools need contain this.

Lets get vaccines everyone quickly possible, get Covid manageable levels (measles), completely eradicated (smallpox). one arguing 10 shots end day given whoever around. point restricting gets vaccine going result vaccine unfortunately wasted, better alternative vaccinating less people higher risk group. open vaccinations much, end result vaccines given ineffieciently. first person quoted said following: start giving anyone wants scheduling priority said guidelines.

which cannot do. result inefficient distribution vaccine. Multiple areas add colors “covid threat” charts time went something like “green=0 cases” “red=25 cases capita” entire area covered surpsssed “red” zone.

The local health department shared chart Facebook showing avoid entire state red. wife doctors appointment asked visited areas “high risk” confused currently one.. can’t believe y’all still energized stay inside house. Good god shit depressing. I’ve going since started, summer comes I’ll going even more. Probably without mask. 

Everyone demanding others STAY INSIDE WEAR MASK main reason won’t shit June. losers can’t force anything lol. information correct. masks used week getting disposed off, KN95s used 8 hours. cloth mask also cleaned, generally feels bit worse two masks mentioned. quick shoppping cloth masks. get docked least half bull pulled last year. gonna kind game changing anything. Actually, definition....

Pandemics cover entire countries world. SARS 1 neither. unfortunately election everyone already edge previous issues. perfect storm, media realized gold mine. well house arrest since october parts europe point start think shit might related hospitals collapsing anymore

but hopefully healthy bout mass hysteria sister take vaccine shit. really evil thing they're saying ""the vaccine cause infertility."" say ""there studies confirming cause infertility."" Intensifying fear introducing uncertainty. Vile. Yeah increasing every day approximately 15 million admistered already. 35 million doable 2-3 weeks way states ramping now. Either way, disagreeing give take week. Damn, 2 minutes already downvoted. Probably downvote you, too.

Japan's culture best regarding treating others correctly, respect given mostly face value. read it’s 70s range. Even 50%, it’s considered viable vaccine. Thanks saving click. Hospitals strengths, fast vaccination staff one them. Disappointing, hopefully hospitals soon picture. read comment like read article. deliberating

Debilitating*  Look Russell Westbrook keeps hospital leaving room sick people, keeps able study / work instead home taking sick days. Protects secondary long term side effects would also reduce productivity might put burden medical system bad enough. Prior? No. tell want follow scheduling. 21 Pfizer 28 moderna mean free pass? Thank you! good part, appreciate it! Definitely get vitamins in, exercise healthy! makes difference general. especially sick! irony first one send gulag. Didn’t pick tone message guess hate fucking bot clearly conception America works think happen. That’s simply country runs. Even careful, conservative estimates scientists giving us don’t really say this.

Also, don’t anymore big elections another two years. Palestinian Authority want vaccines Israel, prefer buying Russian vaccines. 
Palestinians living Israeli authority vaccinated like everyone else. ""common"" important part here. common? even common western countries? 

I lived Japan many years, safely say I've never felt safer anywhere else world, except perhaps Singapore look ""sealioning"".. seriously, everyone troll.

and seriously, look todays's Science Magazine: "" New coronavirus variants could cause reinfections, require updated grandmother 89. couldn’t walk without assistance. fact home health care daily including overnights. wouldn’t able stop anything. Everyone family knew got sick would die. complacent killing her. did, people strains though getting publicity. Yes Reddit also shits Japan time, like guy replying said Ok states arranged like periodic table seemingly order ever. like opposite no? Media never fails exaggerate story is. Obviously something like this, things definitely brink many hospital systems around world. 21st populated country world... area (DC metro) locked early statewide mask mandates things basically never really got bad here. know people work local hospitals one said set special Covid ward early on, closed enough patients. lockdowns effective.

But completely halt cases illnesses unless kind draconian lockdown nobody would actually consider. Theoretically every single person absolutely contact anyone 3-4 weeks virus would fizzle out. lieu lockdowns, masks, restrictions, etc. serve slow spread halt completely.

People outraged areas lockdowns still cases literally plan. think area bad, know would worse restrictions?

And placed restrictions like North Dakota Sweden among highest per capita cases.

My point original plan ""flatten curve"" somehow got turned everyone panicking cases. way get rid cases vaccinations herd immunity. Amen. average age COVID death 80. Pompeo making shit evidence behind it. that's unusual likes him. Well can't tell related to, hospital barely eating recovery. exactly going pizza parties lol. wish fraction kind public shaming would make way US he’s American Although course Tourists allowed in, home countries given vaccine people likely visit. world problems, agree cultural level issues lot countries yet decide problems disturb sense fairness well.

However, west shown completely incapable learning lessons except western countries. There’s incredible amount arrogance involved. COVID-19 largely contained East Asia due proactive lockdowns aggressive contact tracing, still can’t go back normal USA, Europe et al royally managed fuck responses instead simply, humbly copying proven work.

Which would fine affected west - Asians long given trying get superiority complex lot westerners learnt get thing. time, can’t west **still learning**.

So, forgive I’m little testy - Japan faults still done far superior job people overall, since health health, physical mental. exactly happening thread then? like ten people piling tell bad are? Ha...fair enough. Point you. Ok... people countries dying significant health issues. we’re still type restrictions end year, I’m simply moving Florida Arizona. can’t live like this. I’m young want fun I’m masks, totally, much need 80% open, rate vaccinations go move along, especially single-dose vaccines go live. Honestly whether called ""Battle Royale"" think style gameplay would emerged pretty quickly anyway. likely would come even earlier videogame internet technology task. person's age make less unfortunate them? Didn’t say wasn’t biased, I’m crying lmao. 
 believe UK fallen even since originally posted stats, sad. 
 
It literally hasn’t. vaccinations outnumber daily cases lmao. one person way behind others, good. You’re always going somebody says it’s awful. around 10:00 hour. 
I’ll give USA Today. They’re usually sophomorish pieces series they’ve done well. always pick people based reality people giddy masks forever. cases people adhering stricter social distancing

uhh I’m going restaurants movie theaters anything “normal” case counts down. Period. Restrictions driving economic downturn, virus is. vaccine ... fully effective month given.

[This completely Lift operators ain't fucking around Northeast, best mask compliance I've seen mountains. I’m woman whose really beauty services. 

Cosmetologists notorious thinking they’re experts 40 hour course know much actual doctors. understand bothers you. That's perfectly normal. duty change culture ways. Eventually time goes change. begin urbanize rely less less rural agrarian communities things change. Think large divide US rural urban demographics. north east industrialized cosmopolitan became tolerant order enable cohesion among workers society. demand workers outstripped male populace allowed, women given autonomy able pursue careers. became nation excess gay rights became accepted. bumps along way happened. 

This may happen societies due religious fundamentalism middle eastern societies. witness certain ethnic communities well first world nations. solution simple. Reject multiculturalism embrace assimilation. done Irish Italian immigrant communities descendants basically indistinguishable general populace. incidentally improve things home nations. lived Japan years speak Japanese fluently please tell more.

The reason I’m pushing back begin idea mental health overly stigmatized Japan pretty much incorrect. I’ve met ton Japanese people open mental health issues nobody gives shit it. suffer depression anxiety open nobody cares. I’m saying. People know nothing country feel like free pass shit reason. Omg really going doomsday counter every day variant. gods sake haven’t even conclusively proven it’s worse mRNA vaccines show 30-40% people vaccinated positive Covid test. showed 95% efficacy preventing symptomatic Covid. test assymptomatics.  say COVID exist. Nowhere.

So aside violent streak also delusional. Nice combo.  sick, ty!! 7 times, precise. mean....have wore mask kicking breath lol? I'm likely brush mask 50M people covers everyone 65 up, everyone co-morbidities, every healthcare worker?

Don't think that's true. study prove infectious.

This post taken misinfo is, especially edited title. Sports metaphor: US dogshit baseball (social distancing, masks, etc) team made bunch children, wanna try best well, whole lot want there, parents (government) made play. matter bad kids wanna play well, never gonna competent team, one happy.  always Yes, go back point. way 'living' completely unsustainable. Also never brushing teeth ftw! say people get tested they're experiencing COVID-like symptoms

I'm even sure that's true anymore. least NY, we've told months get tested matter what. Lots people know regularly tested work, lots others regularly test peace mind make sure they're asymptomatic.

I think percent positive indicator tell way things trending. keeps going up, that's obviously cause concern. Could Also Notice Damage easier someone active. wish America, whole, brains guts treat anti-maskers like monsters are. Case point standard family, social circle vaccinated plus another 6-8 weeks allow others chance. 

I low risk work home get open general public. 

After returning normal. waiting antivaxers change mind. 

I hopeful means sometime May. People DON’T criticize countries way pile Japan every time it’s mentioned. 10% Americans either COVID vaccine. 10% consists frontline workers really careless people ie people likely transmit virus first place. Unless new strain *really* blows soon we’ve probably already highest daily rate new infections. takes three weeks die Everything isn’t politics... lost. I'm sure Starbucks baristas looking forward getting Karen prove vaccinated. initial idea, yes. 

until dead seems fair 
Cmon! sad Japan gets free pass backwards many ways

Quick, call anti backward police /s. Seriously getting free pass context even mean point? contradiction think there? know 6 fit healthy guys bad lungs Covid. lying upset people calling out. ""Half dozen kids barely breathe,"" lol one nurse saw vial go trash mean nationwide crisis. Right. We’re going literally delay opening entire countries months people regardless Covid need insanely careful. massssssssive goalpost shifting getting downvoted shit you’re getting upvoted shit? Dude even go /r/Japan everyone critical things say country totally agree. things make people happy get pushed undetermined date future, become increasingly difficult remember we're saving first place. alive? Or, people actually may unaware (babies, Alzheimer patients, etc) would probably congregating house party. Yeah that's horseshit article. Doses per 100 people % people received least one shot.  Science weed! order prevent infection completely, vaccine would sterilizing. Sterilizing means virus would even take hold start replicating vaccinated people. data producers vaccine showed around 60-70% protection level sterilizing immunity, means 30-40% vaccinated people still got infected enough pop positive Covid test. layman science behind mRNA vaccines elicit good antibody production certain areas, great job mucous membrane region, leaves door open virus establish infection allow vaccinated person shed virus, even though antibodies keep experiencing much visible illness. potentially larger issue new variants causing infected people multiple times amount virus bodies OG variant. infection like battlefield, new variants turn virus WW2 Britain WW2 Russia far numbers troops.  post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Same. I’ve never problem cold, doesn’t even ruin day. really. We've never developed coronavirus vaccines test vaccine sterilizing immunity. possible virus still spread reaches symptomatic stage vaccine targeted. ""That'll teach her.""  Except vaccine 2 shot course fully effective month given. understand, people love put tinfoil hat act like know something others don't. 

But bigger problem state TV actually spreading misinformation vaccines. love blame high number deaths America/Europe ""vaccine inefficiency"" everyday headline goes like ""X number people died pfizer side effects"".

They actually making many people believe Iran + Cuba vaccine solution end pandemic even though human trials started last month.

---
Edit: top that, claim Europe/US trying give us manipulated vaccines perform bioterrorism people. don’t know downvoted, yes, ideally whole world able buy distribute best vaccine available. way single (or two) company able cope demand anyway. goalposts based select few. makes sense. vulnerability always forefront. We’re gonna shut society .01 percent people keel get fever NCAA football too. Among FCS football programs, 98% lose money year. exposure make it. caught not-so careful. Lost sense taste smell, thankfully they’re already coming back. Strangely though. Like smell components things, whole bouquet, things close nose. bf smelt loaf bread gone off, point making nauseous, couldn’t smell thing. 
Im also worried long term inflammatory effects. saliva, u need think source paper article  Yes, data verified, it’s complete. many studies showing long term cardiovascular damage (and parents) feel comfortable either studied vaccination available. Thankfully vaccination impacts studied ages 13+. variants neutralized vaccine, vaccine's immunity thought last year minimum. understand talking non-issues, strikes sealioning. Break law... one know... feels good. people really upvote anything related japan now? like person getting kicked store wearing mask.  Sorry horrible things specific Japan. “Well every country problems” doesn’t cut it. I’m doctoral student studying developmental disabilities mentor Japanese. Japan recognize learning disabilities. It’s outrageous.  people still roaming around 10+ months pandemic?  know little morbid, every time read headline huge number people getting infected, think ""well, least they're effectively vaccinated."" one tests positive, worth swabbing every day find 'negative' date go back work? mean even work like that, Monday positive, wednesday negative? thought wearing masks cinema restaurants nuisance. we’re even allowed that, i’d gladly go back anything mask on. Seriously....anytime hear Canadian complaining healthcare slow sad chuckle near 26 year old Union insurance California places. don’t share border internationally unlike nearly every country EU. wider reason vaccine roll coming later game virus mostly eradicated. also don’t know vaccine affects transmission yet. multiple variants leaders playing safe make sure vaccines effective all. 

It would nice everyone didn’t try get angry behalf. Australians support measure. would Reasonable.
Sadly well Majority Making poor Decisions.
Travel Christmas Significantly meaning 80% making ""bad"" decisions. Tell previous business owners permanently boarded shops restaurants country. least hospital workers still livelihoods. pandemic sucks lot people reopening soon possible important. I’m optimistic everyone America offered vaccine within next months- sooner 50+ age groups. pessimistic projections see going around based either misunderstanding current pace continue unaltered people positions responsibility promising. New vaccines getting approved soon rollouts ramping up. Probably bit both. always going surge everyone traveled holidays. next time we'll see level traveling summer, point vaccinations gone lot further. I'm thinking post-surge slump coincides real decline. much wanna bet dude American mightve felt sorry mask kinda slipped time got banned instantly, happened ok  tossed half expired warming ... *probably* know handful people who've hospitalized, zero dead, know two nurses work COVID wards insist pandemic restrictions excessive.

I know 20+ people gotten it, ranging teens 90s, 1 hospitalized (an 85 year old) everyone completely fine. lasting effects.  Give facts make alabama look good compared states. know one:

The robert trent jones golf trial quite nice good price. 

Doesn't exactly outweigh facts though. Education best... really sad. damned do, damned don't. assault, covid would weapon, covid, weapon can't charge assault 

Assault (deadly) weapon usually separate charge. weapon requirement assault itself.

Assault, unlike battery, even require actual harm - reasonable apprehension. example: claiming COVID coughing people, even turns afterwards COVID transmissible can't charge assault someone breathing.

It's ""for breathing"", repeatedly refusing wear mask room many people ongoing pandemic, intentionally putting others danger.

Currently, courts probably count assault, think cyril0 expressing desire change (""*should* considered"") rather stating right now. Right add people vaccine analogy. Surely opposite much likely. vaccinating population twice fast, UK cutting time new mutation arise half. Okay, would care share think makes Alabama great?   put immediately anyone , wasting vaccine reason. held liable come federal charges. would change real quick. really would use dilute baby shampoo neti pot, prevent Covid. 

I everything part. may harm good. almost like government responsibility keep us healthy greatest good source ""hundreds thousands""?

I agree probably variants quite looked them. need sequence recently started sequencing something like 1 400 cases.

Also theory different strains virus spread differently explains suddenly gets bad area even lockdowns. seem high correlation lockdowns spread.  62% 70% effective said British government putting ideology practicality declined sign EU vaccines scheme! whole situation much inertia enough people pumping brakes. every discussion coronavirus website, country, warrants comparison US. Uh, don’t bogart beaker friend, pass me. Australia west east point anyone going concert simply doesn’t give shit, it’s don’t expect get sick, deserve sympathy  Great, it’s single dumbest fucking business decision business make going Memorial Day on. 

I’m pushing pst worker, sure hell won’t shopping store that’s mandating masks say June mask mandates gone everywhere DISHORNOUR! going doctor!! Won’t take away ppl actually need it? Step one use vaccines. “Possible”

“May” based fact. statistics say, metrics relatively worse states. 

There many ways measure success, empirical data constitute canon paints part picture.

I suspect 99% make argument even Alabama. I'm America, I'm essential worker. Hospitalized covid patients likely type people (old, multiple conditions) frequently hospitalized regardless

Not saying covid isn’t also contributing number. Yes , also held accountable saying effective thier words. precautions telling people cover thier face. Would saved many lives. done that. 7 10 years. ""disappears"" due laws structured. Even though debt die, cant really affect past statute limitations, reporting laws. Coming someone stacked-up ER bills employment insurance financial crisis. 20% US population largest 100 cities. large spread nationwide vaccination effort like this.

I think US ever tried anything like national scale before. ""last mile"" problem. probably relatively easy get enough doses within 10 miles 80% population. next step problem. Crawford 36 years old played Blackhawks 15 years. probably considering retirement even COVID.  also per captia like france bad deaths ade locking od that. full steam ahead like US currently. Strike pose

Vogue.

It's vogue based fact Kids school Christmas break? Schools probably play much bigger part would like admit. started back within last week so. interesting see numbers go back weeks. always one. 

I professor clear would give zero final didn’t bring phone up, went exam.

He warned policy weeks final. gave warnings email exam, verbally entered exam hall, handing exams. even envelopes could put phone in, made clear would absolve envelope phone went off. 

Didn’t stop girl phone go off. whole family going subreddit Japan designed like American map except states made squares size. NY barely half vaccines used.  guarantee reddit would furious vaccine sold black market first wealthy people simply cut ahead paying money. rules intended avoid unintended outcomes. Yes 1918 president even said wear mask. point people shamed beaten police wearing them. area bad like Philly thier famous parade. Covid different internet, even comparison then. Something simple US president wearing mask, would saved many lives. Interesting, wonder one might ""recharge"" mask used piece latex similar balloon, hair, stick balloon ceiling trick. Seriously? Mental health issues make people wear mask improperly. might breakdown, feel sorry everyone time. I'm Canada, Ontario. Non-essential businesses curbside pickup only, pretty much go where-ever want, government strongly discouraging non-essential travel, police specifically said can't stop people cars ask going. would say lockdown tame compared Italy April Australia August, can't compare Wuhan all. Seems bit missed opportunity didn't. understand Vogue opinion site. Stretched paper clips Thanx correction. surprise me. Totally something Biden would say.

[This article says ""100 million people"". recent articles saying 100 million shots. 

I'm less interested slogan number. need pressure Biden keep ramping up. ""We"" need 16 billion doses repeats immunity wears off. mean, Trumpie tried prevent numbers coming out. Hard criticize them.   pills hand day asked them. generic brand 2 month supply less $10. Granted health insurance still. Serious question. looking argument. see vaccine widely available children 3?  They’re variants, strains. It’s important distinction- SARS-CoV-2, virus causes COVID-19, strain coronavirus family, hundreds thousands minor variants SARS-CoV-2, functionally identical other. Among British Variant South African variant, infectious still belong SARS-CoV-2 strain. Media hype making variants much threat actually (and also inaccurately calling strains). increased transmissibility challenge, there’s reason suspect variant unaffected vaccine undetectable form testing. thousands known variants way back March 2020. Lots conjecture article. And, straight article, “To clear: downstream considerations,” Krause says. “The public think imminent, new vaccines needed.”

You relax. Really. Research UN Switzerland shows even though level antibodies fade, body maintains sufficient memory B cells, manage stave reinfection Wait pandemic come control. Thatbwill take time. places attract tourists still there.  Especially easy get fired speaking mind athletics. Escapes one particular type monoclonal antibody sometimes. polyclonal fine, cell mediated immunity also fine. much effect. directly related article, lady wearing knit mask?

I zoomed looked like may inner layer, really? Reddit likes doom. 

This part reason I(we) physically shopped stores past 9 months. can't imagine like dealing arrogant fools daily basis.

How would like shop store someone covered in: mosquitoes, lice, fleas, bed bugs ticks? can't see virus, mean real, idiots. Depends well existing COVID antibodies handle variants, collectively speaking may accidentally nerfed screwing horribly holidays listened healthcare workers offering vaccine instead article read. It’s probably relatively safe, SERIOUSLY doubt you’re gonna wait fall vaccination. can’t even imagine would happen. You’ll probably wait months max. Although I’m basing assumption you’re America, may case. agree btw. They’re acting tough online irl manager tells leave, they’ll leave. determine whether benefits vaccination outweigh risks potential side effects gives prudent advice?

I think died died, died vaccine would major problem. Norway said nothing vaccine. Lol, PA still stuck Vaccinating LTCF Healthcare workers SMH. good thing caseloads  everyone vaccinated. talking time everyone wants vaccinated. Eh get downvoted upvoted opnions time. opinions change, Sub's.

Regardless, there's definitely people dislike people criticize public health officials media general prefer say public ""dumb"". think failed public deeply entire thing. Public empowerment education, along giving choices voluntary action, instead idea ""we must make correct thing people make best choice"" would tool would preferred used. Spoiler: talking millions people here, recommend either way. let make choice, hate you. 

In 2019, issued guidelines communicating public kind event. wish would followed. page 19-20

New York State says 3700 dispensing locations planned 650 currently running. that's 5x increase. Texas recently gone 25 51 ""mega"" vaccination sites areas like FL LA County setting stadiums 1000's vaccinations per day.

But currently US getting 8-12 million doses per week 1.1 1.7 million per day. want hit 2 million obviously increase that. Despite talk rollout ""failure"", 20 states used least half doses 39 used least 40%. reporting they've made appointments entire remaining supply.

So they're going get supply. Pfizer said sitting 15 million doses could release would give bump while. need ramp manufacturing least 50% get 2M/day. Bowfinger, 1 best comedies ever   say like stood year. TSA report travel holidays prepademic levels.

""We don’t know it’s Covid destroyed beta cells make insulin get Type 1 diabetes, whether causes insulin resistance, develop Type 2, seeing surprising new diagnoses diabetes.""

What?? tell type diabetes people have? 

I going say something seem unusual seniors co-morbidities, ended hospital, would end seems pointing towards patients developing new health issues. I'm curious know rate new health issues diagnosed hospitalized covid. bacon? 99.8% side effects whatsoever, even headache? Love prove point me. 

I don’t need politicians tell anything. I’ve got medical experts that. 

FYI, convince attack state capitol thing, make sure keep phone data on! much this.

People hyping nearly much should. changes everything.

Covid around since NOVEMBER 2019 lot places Italy Spain. mortality increase Nov2019 Mar2020. Explain that. even possible?

The explanation reaction covid caused excess deaths March May 2020. gave AIDS/Ebola drugs people something like common cold. intubated people popped lungs out.

As far seems unreasonable, possible explanation. mortality increase november 2019 march 2020. virus goes 100 cases end September 2020 30000 end October 2020 goes COMPLETELY UNNOTICED FOUR months.  speculation wrong. source front remember seeing headline weeks ago regards professional athletes susceptible virus. maybe wrong future, time machine?

The person I’m replying massively misunderstands lot things. Relapse addiction included.  ya don’t want get vaccines Another PA Ministry Health official said expected vaccinations West Bank Gaza Strip begin next month. He, too, clarified PA asked Israel supply Palestinians vaccine. “We working obtain vaccine number sources,” official added. “We department Israeli Defense Ministry. government Ministry Health, making huge efforts get flip side people worried getting vaccine due “long term effects” - oh okay. blood clots scar tissue lungs mild thing worry about. 

Also hear 50 year olds. overweight, diabetes smoked life. Get damn vaccine Karen. Grow up. Keitaro screwed he? vaccinated probably carriers, contagious: conclusion interim results study Sheba Hospital.

I wish could elaborate this. still trundling along Astrazeneca vaccine. really fail understand still take weeks come conclusion. Presumably schedule sub-sub-sub-comitees. really impression many people healthcare bureaucracy, ""emergency"" aspect situation yet fully manifested itself. Department health worker here.

People contagious starting 2 days prior symptom onset 10 days onset (total twelve days). 10 days fever ***and*** mild/improving cough considered longer contagious. still fever bad cough. add 24h isolation symptoms go away. immunocompromised initial 10 day isolation period extends 20 days.

Assuming meet criteria (at least 10 days onset, fever, cough) longer contagious regardless test. fact don’t encourage repeat testing looking negative exactly reason. Tell ""severe arthritis"" leading knee replacement arthritis prior covid. Why? can't fix stupid. interested south africa &amp; Brazilian strain I'm happy PA's health secretary literally said vaccines go waste, find someone give to, doesnt matter is, long 18 depending vaccine). reports vaccines thrown out. people telling dangers pain meds addictions. good advice - even better advice need get better. I’d like say entire family got COVID know thing two. helped recover advised need. want get better need take exercise slow - that’s jogging primarily light walking - occasional warm compound exercise. 

You also start taking assortment vitamins antioxidants. 

That includes vitamin C ( vitamin even though it’s something would likely low beginning infection ). B12 - need mitochondria get back shape - best way replenish vital compound I’m willing bet low point. Hydration water can’t stressed enough, I’d like add consuming progressively increasing amount antioxidants. Personally provided pomegranate juice red onions asparagus. chosen due immense anti-inflammatory oxidative stress reducing properties, words give lungs heart break give time heal effectively. 

I’d also invest pulse oxymeter track progress- blood o2 ever issue. want 95-100, however varies. Things work virus. main thing timing priming immune system. recommended family take medications unless absolutely needed. reason? Synthetic medications often put extra load liver - even they’re working. 

Lastly - may sound dumb. try. therapy. Yes ....nitrous oxide therapy. entails using breathing exercises strengthen vasculature. 

I’m doctor - study biotechnology, terms understanding inner working virus things help. I’m open questions. I’ve enough experience, unfortunately. keeping chin - too. don’t see scenario anything originally asked. 

Op said vaccine available everyone someone chooses take that’s them. rest use aren’t putting lives hold stupidity. 

The vaccine isn’t currently available children low priority due risks. 

As far sending kid McDonald’s ball pit, vaccine widely available general public yeah got problem letting go. Hell nephew (he’s bio kid lives me) school since August hasn’t issues. I’ve exams yeah basically made open-note since can’t really prevent cheating. added problems made problems hard shit compensate. Might travel insurance. heard/remember also like 20 bucks shot. Maybe 80 dollar fee get administered? Even 100 bucks cheap they're buying plane ticket get it. real expensive part staying three weeks second shot flying back home waiting flying again.   Oh no, pressured job, green light solution biggest global crisis 100 years? Call HR hostile work environment compare that? talking back normal. McDonalds ball pit normal. back that? adjust metal clip stop fog. Usually fitting on. takes little patience. There’s anti fog products never tried them. Fogging glasses means bad fit. Yea - definitely makes long-term management COVID patients much complicated. Funnily enough, hated fried onions COVID, love them! guess whatever flavor turned dulled enough enjoy now. Look Covid long haulers. one hospital, dunce cap. forget us parents multiple kids. stay home dad take care 2 kids 7 school, 2 year old, newborn, stuff day myself. Shit hard fuck right now, stay top work try walk legitimately struggling regardless much put it. well distance learning, vast difference person distance. understand effects both, distance learning much harder kids one's fault. extra time, stay school zoom teacher subjects, walk work them, hard time it. kids well online learning, whole different thing class. US 169,641 new cases 17th
Japan 5,773 new cases day.  too. go grocery store doctor's office. grocery store, 1 hour close I'm usually one there. 

And yet see people dancing hugging singing bars drive by. Infuriating. Lots non-Australians go virus control measures thread, meanwhile enjoy normal life! don’t know difficulty understanding course we’re willing tolerate cases, unchecked migration country “few” cases, it’s enough spread send us back lockdown conditions. also don’t put mask right going store, find anti-maskers vile, idiotic people don’t want associated even slightest. hope so, still stick timeline things move slower hope. Appreciate insight :)   lung problems probably seen first diagnosis, (some of) heart problems, chronic liver kidney conditions diabetes new. That's guess, least. That’s interesting af, I’ve sorting new months didn’t even think abt  know, judging reaction governments europe would say world-threatening virus. absolutely course, reaction governments really something. Ok... opinion actually worth damn? vaccine scientist medical expert fair enough, one people looks efficacy % absurd way like sort review score would opinion matter way whatsoever? former high level athlete ability perform slowly chunked away variety ""not critical own"" injuries, still rough. everything trainers told me, turns advice generally geared toward keeping competitive moment, long term health. 

All cavalier attitudes toward athletes young disgusting, general lack compassion show declining injured athletes terrible well. 90% articles misleading studies back claims smell bad? 

Anyway that's still interesting. evidence single hospital REDDIT. Lmfao True died, likely caused vaccine.

You math estimate many deaths would occur similar ransom sample see 23 far expectation got flu shot every year, chance lighter case flu, even formula bit ""wrong""? 

Just curious... get flu shot every year hoping helps, far flu me. youngest 5th grade year get prepped middle school. education taken tremendous hit. simply isnt educated enough. Zoom meetings cut it. patents work home cant teach hom ourselves...its like energy anyway. devastating us. talk going make years worth lost education.  renewed hatred almost 40% fellow citizens advertised trump loving ignorance?  Literally almost half country wants fight other. 
There non medical factors outbreak ignore perial. Vaccinations aren’t way achieve herd immunity. It’ll combination vaccinations natural immunity. Plus, comes September (which conservative estimate), December good estimate GP acquire vaccine immunity.  still think catch point makes 0 difference reach herd immunity. lack urgency costing lives now. 100k doses 3-5 lives saved day sit shelf. don’t say! makes fun two thirds article mentions good closed environments. weird 180, usually people start good parts.

I guess looks dorky make fun start certainly would enjoy life North Korea; I'd suprised similar analogy stated leaders communist/semi-comunist leader, want strip away personal freedom Doubtful. state opened general population 65 covid vaccines. COVID, lost taste smell 10 days. try hot sauce period - barely eating anything anyway felt like waste food. time *think* could still tell whether something sweet salty (although might 100% psychological based memory food) think still would experienced physical sensations spiciness. taste back, hot sauce back normal. happened concert.  thats califuckedup ya I'll wear one. Simple that. retail employees bartenders want mask police anything wear one. especially true summer wearing mask equated literally murdering people. It’s weird, one specific smell stuck nose it’s weeks wouldn’t say smells bad, good either, it’s weird describe won’t go away lol comparing sanitary standards McDonald's ball pit schools lmfao Starting think even that's debatable too. world end year last year dude. New Yorker, I’m happy keep tourists forever. Living life completely surrounded tourists every day gets old. contributed massive spike last March anyway.

Of course that’s financially feasible so... previously flu make low risk Covid? Surely it’s obvious isn’t US-only thing? Europe 1000 deaths per capita (US 1226 worldometers). includes France, Spain, Italy, UK, Sweden, Switzerland. It’s obviously unhelpful trying understand root causes blame problem US-specific political issues problem happening elsewhere degree. France Italy much extensive lockdowns did, lot “right” supposedly done wrong US. would things different they’re they’re different either? tell type diabetes people have?

(Not doctor, take everything say grain salt.) complicated apparently. Type 2 diabetics present low insulin levels glucose toxicity type 1 diabetics present level insulin resistance. 

You test fasting insulin level C-peptide levels, accurate diagnostically glycemic control restored several weeks. Obviously, quick diagnostic process.

Positive antibody tests (IA-2, GAD-65, etc) denote autoimmune process (suggesting type 1), negative tests rule out.

So patient returns hospital found new case diabetes, hard quickly nail type diabetes. make take days, even weeks, various tests symptom analysis lead definitive diagnosis. It’s ‘dystopian’. live Amsterdam, american though would love be. browse shit app i'm bored. No, they're 50% immunity. even close. takes 1-2 weeks full immunity develop second shot vaccine, 4-5 weeks first shot. 

Even somehow gave everyone vaccine today, see anything change numbers February earliest. Going concert putting life hold? putting life hold put prison avoiding concerts. part? I'm happy address part individually best can. demand issue raised Scott gottlieb interview yesterday noting vaccines likely open everyone end February Yep. give one warning account situations someone might inadvertently loosened mindlessly pushed concentrating. kick out. done shops, public transport, on. still embarrassing, Texas barely less vaccinated, millions less people. “rich” nations didn’t lockdown instead spent covid/lockdown bailouts poorer nations could effectively halted malaria TB ended child malnutrition ten times over, never sort utilitarian good will

I want end lockdowns quickest empty gestures redundant now. last week encouraging no? goal (herd immunity summer) still reach would expect answer no, woudn't want one telling COVID patients can't care need elective procedures we've delaying months need keep beds open car accidents like. feel like worked hard layoff. Stiff, flexible. Painful actual symptoms bad enough. really scares emerging catalog organ damage vascular system damage, know permanent not. Generally, scar tissue lungs tends permanent (""scar""), could lead day needing oxygen tank rest life, needing lung transplant. vascular failure? think that's straight death lottery. Would please cite sources? Japan one countries though lol. They're middle largest outbreak far, that's atrocious testing levels entire duration pandemic cover-up knows many cases deaths first wave try get Olympics go on. still thing? Toddlers take long potty train, year now. Usually presidents age poorly tenure. term, literally everyone else. 1. dont know vaccinated stops spread.
2. people immune diseases older folks strong immune response strong people 12 65 years. 
3. vaccines even 100% effective. rang 70% 100%.. Japan fraction infection rate states like Florida, five times population.

Because, culturally, lot consideration collective, particularly relation individual.

Because 681 venues 535,245 participants, **one** person couldn’t (or wouldn’t) wear mask correctly.

I can’t even get kind adherence rate going fucking grocery store. 'completely right', guess, private companies personal health information, people fucking cheering it? YES. There's focus death counts statistics related that, seems conversations typically totally gloss major consequences disease age groups. alive mean non-consequential case full recovery. 

It's maddening, us read know people bad cases sound crazy consuming popular media. I've fight continue working home... constantly need justify I'm social, want others wear masks around inside, etc... btw I'm living Germany. imagine much tougher US. team explicitly considering this. They're looking zoonotic origin. can't find something look really think China allow America investigate it?

Well could done without China's permission. That's intelligence services no? article believed, government sources. frightening common losing sense taste smell is. spending much time this""- Man spending much time   Take care yourself. Depression, anxiety, anger hard deal - matter warranted are. least UK Germany vaccinating faster they’re finding new cases, odds looking better better USA competent leadership 48ish hours take reins response covid.

Try hang :/  always Olympics. really never expected many responses symptoms. feel bad you. Mine worst morning. hv push covers feet. arms almost work. hv kick feet air sit up, roll bed. Thats hurt like hell. stand time can't stand chair. get worst calf cramps imaginable. take prescription Naproxen. Next Rheumatologist appt Wed last year?! That’s horrible! doctor kind...but, capable parsing information determine getting novel disease continually reports long term symptoms isn’t something want deal 40 yo. Especially symptoms cardiovascular nervous systems. really don’t understand many people unable learn documented evidence along experiences mistakes others. 

Even hearing rumors anecdotal accounts issues, made sure extremely cautious could reviewed experts recommendations could made. Better safe sorry, imo. Especially precautions rather innocuous (i.e. wearing mask, etc) compared possible life-long health condition. McDonalds ball pit. 20 kids. 1 yours, 19 antivaxxers. ok scenario. question case rate small, community spread limited, they’re willing fairly forcefully implement measures dramatically reduce spread trust population to, large, abide them. Even asymptomatic people test PCR positive? Thanks insight /u/yaolilylu exam viewed one important days student’s lives. It’s like SAT, except take once.

It's rocket science.  🙄 actually worse that. Even vaccines 90% effective, means vaccinated 70 year old *still* lot likely die covid unvaccinated 30 year old.  comment Japanese news source translated ""his"" pointing may confirm it. thought comment part thread...

It's adjacent thread. confusing mistake thinking thread. pre-coffee I'd already working hour... Fried brain.  Ya thing you’ll find number racists Long Island Boston cities states places suspect, New York Mass consistently ridiculed. 

Was pet peeve, wanted say something it’s gotta suck Alabama trying hard everyone makes fun internet.

This Corona anymore, I’ll rest case lol. Thank you. know I'm smart enough understand though lol. never said didn't. pre-symptomatic people still asymptomatic develop symptoms. honestly seems like therapeutics severely ill way mess. People also careless around house general. Maybe he's mouth breather. Israeli. assure leadership terrible gets. done sending vaccine hospitals national guard first.  Hospital 500 employees got 10,000 doses, probably 9,500 doses open door public vaccinate first. 

National guard thing, tasked vaccinating retirement homes home bound elderly. 

Everybody else, get line. vaccine comes system, gets sent places need it, like urgent care clinics pharmacy clinics. 

Empty stores could taken set vaccine stations served community's first responders week, opened public. 

We could done much better. certainly seeing reinfection high numbers. global confirmed number remains tiny expect Biden start effecting vaccination process, week, month, 2 months? This. I'm caution situation calls it, mother fucking people dying. gives rats fuck allergic reactions require monitoring. Stop pausing rollout! fucking debacle. wasted vaccine. Enough cover almost 1% population. give let whatever happens happens. five people die vaccine saves 800 lives call fair trade :( one around cares people close starting get sick get drugs. Good job USA heck every one person goes gym 100,000 visit friends family. Great governments giving vaccine free people. US rrelevant concern. Moderna expensive vaccine like 40 50 per dose. Pfizer j&amp;j around 15 20 dose. Oxford around 7 dose. Well basically federal government said second doses said holding back. heard single straight answer many vaccinations actually last month. Enjoy Irish vaccine shortage 👍  Every day new beginning end universe  got chicken pox vaccine probably 1998, got chicken pox 2001, super mild case may thanks vaccine. IDK, feel like Summer 2021 everyones breaking point..especially vaccines not. easy pleasurable blame individuals systemic inequalities real reason virus persists. Wow! impressed. cool I’m saying Alabama awful. went college there. rankings low overall compared states education healthcare. doesn’t mean aren’t exceptions rule. education wise universities pretty average. 

I think like states, Alabama good things offer good people. fair number racists general intolerant people. good things. don’t pretend like rankings say it’s poor education healthcare somehow fake news. it’s evident that’s happening even first world nations

Pre-2020, ""spreading gift"" pretty common meme (mostly reffering HIV); given behaviour 2020/21 folks around globe, unsure laugh facepalm ppl living meme. Cases dropped lot, attributed ""herd immunity,"" OP doing. know people South Dakota finally taking social distancing seriously random.  Found Trumpet  mean basically one tailgated, games damn near empty, teams left right lose players Covid key times.

Even though browns extraordinary year, team sucked doesn’t really feel like real year excuse anymore. Vast majority cases happen home visiting friends think need ADA-style protections accommodations people poor immune systems. vaccinations, think go back normal understanding things extreme low-immune people accommodate without requiring everyone stay home. Daily rocket attacks civilians make good guys No, hasn’t Europe going pick pace vaccine rollout? Aside UK seems going dreadfully slow likely soon South Dakota see this. people '70s '80s getting infected that's largely received vaccine plus relatively small number health care workers. One thing likely happen Dakota's herd happen relatively quickly number active cases going still somewhat high absolute sense relatively much lower was. think North Dakota 20 per 100,000 cases day South Dakota 35 per 100,000. Minnesota 20 25 per 100,000 cases smaller percentage people virus either Dakota based projections. seems like pseudo partial herd full herd immunity means Yeah fucking hate them. work physical job means get sweaty communicate often loudly noisy environment (when boom lift radio example) glasses fog pisses every day. happily wear one reason wear one soon *gone*. society get far mentally ill people around? mean, get point super majority people ok wearing clothes? wearing underwear ok, masks pandemic? 

We're pandemic virus know spread coughing sneezing. Even we're 100% sure masks helps, small ask case help. 1st world Reddit poor countries: Sucks them! 

Also 1st world Reddit: Rich people shouldn’t able cut line country! quite point I'm making. China took 70+ days get daily infection rates near 0. country, took nearly 2 months get daily infection rates 100+ per day near 0 we're seeing daily numbers 3000+ third wave right now.

Once again. gonna take loooong time thing gets crushed. world losers want live we're doomed, one person mask nose causes 0 additional risk.



It's safety, control. This. old data jus throng. Manaus never herd immunity. Possibly many hospitalized nursing homes, 80+.... yes make sure scare everybody more. yeah, legitimate clinical studies allowed. trash ones removed. allow safety/medical/supplement advice people need listening doctors, random redditors. generally allow opinion pieces unless authors highly regarded sometimes exceptions. always modmail whether certain study would ok post mean going America, signed later g7's sinovac deal fell unfortunately.

But things getting better. per capita contraction better think tough this. Yeah, declining Covid cases cool all, ever played Knack?  true, yes. really affect vaccine distribution. thing happened Wuhan.  Spoiler alert: no, it’s headline make click There’s always mutations, they’ve made news before. UK one noteworthy mutation ways worse (less severe transmissible), whereas many mutations towards less harmful variant. That’s totally expected though. statistics? really sad idiot like say covid flue. “holiday surge” basically myth places. never happened. Hell, Michigan, post-thanksgiving post-Christmas saw constant decline. god sad person really established though. speculated theorized based Coronaviruses people get reinfected time due viral mutations. However... people cannot reinfected 5 10 years mutations perhaps importantly second infections considerably milder first ones. likely see something similar vaccine based results. vaccine results similar ICU patients better worse actually read source, youll see presymptomatic people spread people never develop symptoms. thing COVID it’s relatively low risk population thanks asymptomatic cases low fatality rates, it’s short long term game Russian roulette individual. It’s like nothing else people frame reference can’t fathom unexpected outcomes even though little information. Add misinformation boom might well go ahead pick ribbon color now. someone may currently suffering breathing difficulties associated COVID, I'd rather deal shortness breath months compared LITERALLY PUTTING LIFE HOLD YEAR. think got vaccine real rolled en masse.

When friends Facebook taking counts millions limited side effects, lot easier warm 20k faceless individuals. Ohhh okay, mean actual deaths per capita. CA total excess deaths 38,100 population 39,512,223, FL total excess deaths 26,300 population 21,477,737, FL much much worse per capita. Lol-this quote:

Thanks sharing story. 
I'm glad better. 55 days sick sounds pretty awful  would never happen, 1% mean. death rate sustained we’ve hospital capacity treat people. broke lockdowns, hospitals would start shutting we’d fucked. couple things come mind read stories this. 

1 - words great popular scientist, Carl Sagan: Extraordinary claims require extraordinary data. 

These extraordinary claims. talking coal miners asbestos workers clearly easily see permanent lung-scarring could happen. reported 2003 SARS MERS, similar coronaviruses far lethal. also reported influenza. extraordinary claim needs backed data, anecdote self-reported symptoms. mechanism lung damage? mechanism fatigue? millions (especially) Americans go life pro-inflammatory state time similar issues already? Data. want data. 

2 - words fictional botantist Martian: ""When engineers discuss things like speed, use words like 'fast'. They're saying 'fastest man history space travel know like sound it. like sound it."" also use words, ""many"", ""some"" ""attack"". tell us ""many"" people suffering. Look electronic medical records: many middle-aged men previously covid-positive reporting back ER lung-abcesses? ""many"" 5 people 10 people 1000 people? many? 5/10, alarming hell. 5 10,000, drive public policy people receive medical care investigation see going on. bad outcome 9,995 not?

3 - call action stories? clickbait? We're already wearing masks staying home pretty high level. would reporter doctor story us differently? cannot function without pain killers, definition addict, make bad person. actually conditions really think pain problem, seems like quite stage life mid 20s using pain killer months prescription joint pain. There's nothing then. already decided I'm going change mind. change mine. Best luck us both. Regardless don’t vaccinate planet vaccine useless. end plague got cure everyone once. Else doesn’t end.

My stomach actually churned little reading this. used gym 6 times week guy shut down. They’ve open months think people go incredibly stupid. would want space people huffing puffing close proximity? it’s thing, go gym several times week. means eventually going contract covid, it’s game probability. actually really think...

I 3 organs removed 6 year time span, ton blood transfusions spent laughable amount time hospitalized last 13 years life since diagnosed Crohn’s. sure.......it’s meds took responsibly without issue caused everything right? fucking ridiculous. agree, result, testing expensive vaccination. wealth relative.

With benefit hindsight, must learn act quickly next time. 

1. Lock airports. Bring travelers back, quarantine them. 

2. city gets case, lock contact trace. 

3. testing capability better testing capability now.

4. De-politicize action plan. slow killer, we're dead right? Keeps fucking popping up.  suggesting normal life never ever come back, new case COVID anywhere, ever, result immediate widespread local shutdown regardless vaccine uptake.

If 90% population vaccinated, would ""uncontrolled spread"". ""Normal life"" shut everything moment someone diagnosed COVID. Hey pay attention 12 years old? UK strain sound like kind symptoms pneumonia years ago. year symptoms cleared up. Hopefully that’s happens here. death rate COVID-19 pandemic high Los Angeles County emergency order issued lifting environmental limits number cremations performed every month. haven’t rolled since COVID don’t plan foreseeable future. It’s like playing game chicken. Reddit loves horrible misleading clickbait headlines, though. That’s happening new cases detected, well similar countries like NZ VN. catch early, otherwise you’re left uncontrolled spread move normal life. I’ve done quick google search answer inconclusive; there’s way know point. There’s obviously risk long-term side effects, seems doctors would simply argue risks disease greater. fact sheet tells nothing major Covid-19 vaccines currently distribution. Wow truly Amazing! lay rest thoughts people passing J&amp;J Pfizer Moderna vaccine J&amp;J less effective. No, empathy would entail *understanding* good people. Understanding people generally frail, old and/or obese. people died Covid necessarily *from* covid.

Empathy would mean overreacting punishing overwhelming majority people something affect small minority. 

People starving right panic caused sentiments like yours.

The word you’re looking empathy **sympathy** different. Etc. liberal NY Times

**Excess deaths**

* Florida: 16%
* Texas: population**

* California: 14.3%
* Florida: 20.5%
* Texas: Think hovering around 8% positive couple hundred hospitalizations nyc. That's literal basis lockdown everywhere. 90% Australia vaccinated, also hardly anyone die. Let correct you: never cared. lesser two evils vaccines thrown away?

What worse that? sound like undiagnosed diabetes getting control, dangerous treatable, live normal life. please see doctor. 3,6% what? missing info there, bud. Yes SII mentioned too

Most places failed didn’t even try. Vietnam controlled outbreak despite land borders 3 countries (and sea borders 4 more). Australia manages control borders states. It’s island thing. Cheaper lawsuit... Crohn’s plus host shit

You seem awful sure statement. Please provide citation. Covid. Dunno flu, bad. Myself, mother father got covid, literally got over/finished quarantine week. Thank god okay especially older parents mother asthma. serious problems, never go hospital anything. we're feeling better, dad complaining bad fatigue, says energy had. I'm pretty sure I'm 100%, less tired covid, maybe tiniest bit lingering congestion definitely worry father. Hoping starts feeling like gets energy back soon. disheartening. 700,000 health care workers Turkey received first dose COVID-19 vaccine first four days vaccination campaign country, Health Ministry Turkey started administering CoronaVac vaccine developed China’s Sinovac Biotech company health care staff Thursday.   Yeah? said anything contrary? 

Still, there’s reason nervous.  Impressive. impressive. (15). either cancel tournament. Hope get back 100% soon. Frustrating anytime mention long term effects get downvoted. specific vaccine might causing them

Covishield

Both states utilise Covaxin They're vaccinated they've two jabs though. need bear mind. visited Vegas February last year way home caught nasty “stomach flu”. vomited felt like death three days, got it. 
 
Then couple months later gastrointestinal symptoms started. Ulcers, ibs, gastritis, GERD, constipation, etc. got bad went ER summer asked full CT scan. 
 
I’ve lots acid blockers stomach easing medications months now, doctors tell it’s anxiety / constipation, cast iron stomach life suddenly system wreck? 
 
Part wonders it’s lasting effects mild COVID infection. don’t know people chill literally new virus that’s discovered year ago. Like know ten year effects, twenty year effects? got cold drinks EDC LV? Look Nurse Tammy mask. Made merv 13 filter equal better n95. long fit proper proper coverage. Much safer kn95, simple cloth, etc. exactly won’t regrets shut-in past year. New clickbait variant found Same, like I'm wasting year sitting home still get it. Good luck! I’m feeling too. Lately thinking myself, man I’ve made far..10 months staying home, seeing family all, isolated/cancelled holidays, worrying ER doc dad mom, masking every time go anywhere, cancelled concert$ vacation$, never eating out, traveling, seeing friends, graduation show cancelled, losing work opportunities, tons anxiety. 

At point, get vaccine, feel like time fighting struggling right thing nothing. catch shit light emerges end tunnel? would pissed. longer goes (ugh) put gaslighting it’s big deal. honestly, sometimes really makes question sanity. 

I’m exhausted don’t know anymore except focus hobbies, studies what’s left mental health..and keep I’ve doing. Look forward gardening season? don’t even know. 

I’m tired trying remain determined. Thanks giving opportunity vent. May health remain throughout rest difficult covid journey beyond  Yea fits projections linked page: like start cases going day day now. Thank &lt;3 sure honest. know overall activity sub gone whole.

I think sensible people aren’t much anymore isn’t much left learn like spring/summer. Limit trips house strictly essential things wait approved vaccines rollout, wearing mask go out, ventilation better, etc. know behavior hasn’t changed much since I’m mostly monitoring numbers.

Plus laissez-faire attitude mods turned lot people off.

So there’s much higher concentration well, *these people* (can’t say anything else them/how really feel lest auto filter block comment).

Hey u/BurrShotFirst1804, remember [this made wondering activity sub dropped? Well go, big part it. Start cleaning around maybe people actually want come. caught March, oxygen sats time horiffic (also asthmatic autoimmune disease) recovered quickly took 5k, 10k 21k PB within couple months.

So damn lucky. person school said COVID-19 bad said getting vaccinated ASAP. low go 5-15% country immune?

The basic formula = R0 \* (1 - I) **I** percent population immune, 10% immune gives = R0 \* (1 - 0.9) = R0 \* 0.1 well herd immunity threshold even highest estimated SARS2 R0 - outbreak fizzle own. chalk Social Media third reason.

Without platforms unify crazy letting conspiracy theories infest, wouldn’t become bad cool part empathy also caring millions elderly people planet I’m similar situation. One family members medical event last year don’t know kind impact immune system. pretty much locked since March. It’s hard, it’s worth it. She’s getting first dose Friday, hopefully breathe easier soon  Old people getting extreme bodily response dying likely bearing you, young relatively healthy person. fine. bodies frail. Yeah, one statistic, doubt people thread lying, I’m going make health decisions based anecdotes. easily find people say covid barely affected them. cousin got dies weeks later pneumonia.

Second, Coronavirus mutate, chances can’t mutate much escape vaccine. virus uses spike proteins hijack cells (why it’s called “Corona” virus). doesn’t matter virus does, anti-bodies developed vaccine body always attack viruses spike.

If virus changes spike protein survive antibodies, won’t able hijack cells replicate simply die off. 

I got Covid vaccine last week urge everyone gotten chance soon can.  ""Stronger"" word I'd use virus. might mutate variant immune system recognize. vaccine may still reduce severity case. mean deadly anything either. mutation mean real change, looks different enough immune system recognize it, infectious, less deadly deadly. I've read understand, usually infectious variant becomes dominant one simply better adapted spread eventually out-competes rest. case covid, really seem anything deadly is. 

I wonder bit we'll looking covid booster shots point though. That's deal flu mutating, think flu also volatile coronaviruses. quit gym back March. member 5 years.

Might blessing decided running cardio gotten shit neglected besides rowing. Man running outside soooo much better treadmill. Treadmills suck.

I asthma took arduously painful year running teen. want thing fuck bring back. can’t go back life like that. Join us r/covidlonghaulers lot people going exactly are, included. Hope recover soon! They're 45th per capita Us...so better 5 states least. Ever wonder we're situation? still can’t fucking breathe right :/ it’s long want take deep breath 60 something morbidly obese diabetic father said that.

That’s like 3 people. There’s literally hundreds tested positive many things want say. kind shit absolutely exhausts me. watched cousins wife slowly fall something similar.

US many people already virus largely done probably march may time frame back full normal new normal ""realistic"" Topamax made everything taste nasty hell. miserable. want get best worlds, suggest idea [another states allowed charge $10k+ pop, could funded lot logistics manufacturing doses.

So sell vaccine openly legitimitely rich people mega price, use pooled money accelerate vaccination process provide vaccines quicker people. Keep baby. Scientists St. Petersburg's Smorodintsev Research Institute Influenza conducted genetic study SARS-CoV-2 virus detected cat 1st time [sic; see comment] Russia, discovering strain identical one circulating Russia, institute reported Thursday [14 Jan 2021]. highly suspect early on, lost sense taste smell. never happened even worst colds life. late February/early March, even know confirmed cases state yet, even heard reported symptom couple weeks later Rudy Gobert tweeted it.

But ever since, definitely things taste smell totally different. Toothpaste definitely one things, tastes smells weird hell now, regardless brand flavor. There's also soaps shampoos smell weird hell, one shampoo girlfriend using swear smelled like cat litter. Thankfully, foods taste normal though. ton drinks taste totally different though, lot them, like Coca Cola taste toxic now. Yeah that's follow comment said too. Still concerning. agree. None “game-ending” us work children. Well make sure says mostly true. Can't really say we'll herd immunity sure May something crazy like tested positive 13th, symptoms started Friday... Although seem getting less less ""mild"" passing day Joe Rogan? ""Doctors scientists working estimate mortality rate COVID-19, present, thought substantially higher (possibly 10 times more) strains everyone vaccinated exponential spread happen hospitals overwhelmed, that's safe open up.  Well moved 45th... Mostly states flatlined... 5% protected herd immunity, that's herd immunity meant crazies thought ""let everyone get sick"" sensible. Thank you. googled asking found too. Globalization spread virus early stages, also help stop it. trade off. made ""harder"" people jump line, slows whole system down. think point honestly need move prioritization lists jab EVERYONE wants one. like prioritization lists consistency anyways. Colorado, plan vaccinate every grocery worker, bus driver, teacher, government worker, journalist, food worker, manufacturing worker... like 1/3 state.... that's even get 60-69 pre-existing conditions.

Just get shots people's arms.  wan't transparency look EMA hack (reported Le monde) . english sumary [http://www.uniindia.com/leaked-emails-show-eu-regulator-faced-pressure-in-green-lighting-pfizer-vaccine/world/news/2295015.html](http://www.uniindia.com/leaked-emails-show-eu-regulator-faced-pressure-in-green-lighting-pfizer-vaccine/world/news/2295015.html)

As told Le Monde, basically political interference pressure scientists approving stuff. really worrying. already dealing fast tracked vaccine approval process, given medical companies immunity, top interference scientific process.

The swine flue vaccine related narcolepsy vaccine went normal process still ended horrible cases. going shoot vaccine hundreds millions people span couple months barely tested. happens 0.5% get narcolepsy, thats 1 million people.

Futhermore, interesting exact concerns raised regulators:

*Other documents provide insight three key concerns EU regulator voiced relation Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine November.* 
*The concerns absence approval respect certain production sites, lack data commercial batches vaccine, and, importantly, qualitative differences commercial vaccine batches used clinical trials.*

Seem cause issues right now. example California vaccine halt today seems related bad batch.

Finally, hear anger. think misplaced...Have look South Korea China. able keep society working well without vaccine, effective testing contact tracing. Thus problem incompetence government institutions leaders (and opinion nothing authoritarian vs democratic country). Instead become lazy fat west. especially true government institutions... would make end point fail. Better get standard endpoints. Probably best. Thank you! Really great ideas. Thank much sharing! fun you’re basement even want think another pandemic right now, that's good point. Future viral pandemics could stopped much faster next time around. money? NY money That’s completely legitimate. bunch people missed early treatment avoided doctors office. However, vast majority fine, avoided contracting/ passing Covid high risk people. don’t know person’s risk status is, risk status people bubble. comes optimizing risk-mitigation, isn’t really firmly correct choice applies every scenario. 

It important emphasize risk avoiding doctor though, didn’t that, thanks adding conversation. I'm curious latest news whether people vaccinated still give virus others.

From find online still know (as focus initial research), researching hopeful case. 

Hoping there's positive developments. COVID going us long time like flu. Expect robust flu shot series future  feel like super bowl year? I'm contact tracer told vaccination status means nothing comes ordering quarantines isolation. know guidance change, develop covid symptoms identified close contact may well vaccine, ordered quarantine same. US singled article posted US section Guardian. want report San Marino instead? fair. big chance laugh guy ruined new impulse feel bad him. Help understand- find South Dakota’s deaths/capita statistic alarming? Dr fauci? feel like seen TV forever grandfather, uncle, aunt 4 cousins died 2020 due covid19 indirectly result covid19. think watch another funeral stream. Yes, really think vaccine going make things go back normal. Stay bunker want. used extent US people would prefer think mostly used developing countries think good vaccine there. problem j&amp;j vaccine quite expensive similar expensive Pfizer four times price AZ absolutely agree. one foot middle east another western europe. great. need start kicking people grocery stores reason. What's point mask cover breath? herd immunity South Dakota beginning signs rather vaccine. vaccine result decrease deaths really happened South Dakota yet. Expect see 2 3 weeks. would guess 40 60% South Dakota virus given rural area probably going need 55 60% herd there. actually think they're around 40% recall correctly estimates. denser place would equivalent 55 60%. know seems like provided info able enable ppl jump line... current rate vaccinations occurring, or, least Olympiad open public. Athletes may work, vaccinated arriving Tokyo professional athletes may categories populations eligible vaccination home countries Olympiad begins.  really think vaccine going make things go back normal? Travel, social interaction etc? 

I lost confidence case. expecting easing summer, still international travel. I'm expecting heading winter find variant escaped vaccine vaccine stopped effective winter COVID 2 point...all crap try develop distribute new vaccine. Rinse repeat years. Big oof sympathy you.

When trouble Ontario wasn’t hard arrange seeing therapist university later family doctor. comparing covid influenza preposterous: latter vaccine.

Australia vaccinated population end 2021. Entrance unvaccinated barred. subsequent coronavirus outbreak medically economically insignificant.

Heard current younger generation progressive comparison though, we'll probably see major changes within culture next 20 years Wait, smokers really less likely get virus/bad outcomes? **NOT TRUE**. According Israeli govt 6:31pm local time today 24.26% Israeli population received first dose 4.4% second dose.

I idea website got data, incorrect. Assassins pay triple schizophrenics /s ain't wrong. be, hundreds thousands doses going NYS every week, use future shipments second doses. USA Deaths Covid-19 = **408,089** (January 18th 2021)

Total population Tulsa Oklahoma (2019 estimate) = 401,190 

So lost whole cities worth people USA due virus. Literally lmao masks moving - seated (they seated socially distanced). wish masked times wouldn’t let hugs happen all, they’re also dealing tragic loss necessarily right head space hear that. fully agree done you, don’t control this. I’m trying get guidance whether 7 days negative test enough, opt full 14 days Damn. Going interesting see return normalcy is. hope kids Israel get take masks end school year. God, grim. Sounds white Valid point. “May”

“Less” Could possibly due many people already covid, plus people vaccinated?  hope live CA Bay Area. losing ton faith state leadership. Newsom’s plan far indefinite shutdowns (something doesn’t obey himself). We’ve managed destroy small business economy awful case wise now. vaccination effort really bad start. goals keep shifting also. 

Think spots return normal CA. I’ve lived whole life CA goes past summer real end site probably relocating starting pretty much, challenges... Hoping people start pushing back indefinite timelines never perfect time reopen. saw headlines hours ago saying 26 states decline. Who's lying??? vaccine 70 75% effective, think would see would take spring 2022 get done. 

Not true. There's lot vaccines rely on. plus, another year pandemic straight wreck economy. saying. Whenever see types comments, sure report we'll remove them. least hope they'd adhere safety precautions like masking physical distancing problem get worse lockdowns lifted.  guys large ""gatherings"" V-Day? even authoritarianism everybody collectively agrees it? point social rules. Yikes, bc free healthcare? Handles crime better Minneapolis police department /s  month two we'll see Israel one variants escaped vaccine good place start early developing revaccination program rest world use. doubt going endemic, stop planning need stop language going end like someone flipping light.

**b:** resemblance particulars things otherwise unlike **:** like even suggesting months ago would label fascist office closed everyone working remotely. live RV instead staying put I've travelling around. campgrounds contactless checkin. I'm spending winter Florida Florida winters rock fine far. I've eaten times restaurants pretty empty. Went Universal Studios last weekend Disney Springs yesterday. They're requiring masks temperature checks. I've seen almost everyone good wearing mask (myself included). wash hands regularly use hand sanitizer. donated blood Friday gave covid antibody test negative. responsible, take covid seriously, also live life fun. doom gloom like sub makes be. agree. know good it. Forget universal healthcare, free university public transport. I'd live without somehow, social divide US huge me, matter much money would offered live there. mean, armed vikings walking Capitol building?? offense American friends. Yup, realistically 1m grow figure things out.

I didn’t think we’d hit 1m day mid February. stellar news 101.9 lite fm!  took three goes understand title Great news. Even cases fluctuate weeks, still great news.

We've already hit million doses day 3 days, I'm hoping US double that. terrible advice. 

My sister, extremely healthy individual, went routine checkup found thyroid cancer past summer. found early routine checkup, able surgery remove half thyroid currently fine cancer free (though guess can't technically say 5 years).

The whole point routine check ups avoid missing anything like that.  Preliminary data South Africa suggests novel variant 501.V2 recognized antibodies 21/44 serum samples collected people infected first wave. 

(48% new variant showed “total escape” convalescent serum original strain) might one tested positive prior concert, doubt asymptomatic people breathing like dumbasses. understand us going Federal distribution..... allotment tables Moderna Pfizer... short shipped? referenced?

To make things confusing looks like Pfizer came said 2nd doses held back might explain Federal government's stockpile empty.

Nothing Alex Azar said state's response made sense. even worse can't trust thing Trump admin people like Cuomo want grandstand.... What? surprised support it. saying thrown small minority bus seem pretty proud it. Sadly thought would 1-3 years, since Spanish Flu 2 - depended fast made vaccine.

Have listened Podcast Kill episode Spanish Flu? It’s worth listen (run two women doctorates epidemiology). also episodes COVID-19 talk experts it.[podcast - Spanish feel bad. lot countries thing. EU basically f*cked much, thought over, came back twice, thrice strong. Yes, bit like japan, countries get shit massive massive shortcomings certain regards contrarían one expect first world country (lgbt acceptance japan, healthcare us, etc.), However NEITHER two ostracized entirely it; still quite revered held high overall. 
 
On sidenote, things get lot, repetitively, might something it. hear entire world mocking US healthcare system, even part US itself,maybe time look inward. 
Likewise, Japan could stop many social taboos one talks about, like depressions, mental health disorders, homosexuality, etc. maybe think things handled almost diametric opposite developed countries why.  I'm sure person already knows this, take metamucil constipation. health perspective that's almost entirely over. that's I'm meaning terms loosening restrictions That's going take longer Anyone experiencing panic attacks? I’ve never them, recently went two exercise excursions (one gym, one walk park) times would extremely high heart rate wound hospital.

Yesterday brain felt like swelling filling fluid, started freaking went hospital. losing consciousness panicking severely. gave fluids, adavan CT scan. sent home yet another panic attack diagnosis. I’ve never felt like before. needs China enemy fellow citizens walking talking time bombs stupidity? cares people vaccinated. It’ll prevent severe Covid. Isn’t point?  Damn. got sick February wasn’t convinced covid. couple symptoms lot regular flu symptoms. 

Since November shoulder, elbow forearms painful. rhyme reason, I’m quite active (ultra runner) 

Tests, x Ray ultrasound come back negative. Something article hints states 😄 Good, keep coming, help people want vaccine get faster.  judge good sarcasm. dont want virus means ignore stories like OP. use word ""some"" give personal anecdotal story. There's stats here. assume rare I'm giving sensationalism. meant scare people I'm target audience.  Oh agree absolutely. Maybe tactic done Poland.

One mild symptoms, severe seem mend. I'm scared what's going pop surprise could ruin lives. literally one thing want happen, wait see happens several months. wipe whole grade level.

The lice... killed everyone!? It’s couple weeks since tested positive neck back still ache, can’t smell breathing hasn’t fully gone back normal. Im 15 good shape tried best avoid catching spreading virus probably caught school sister caught mum caught tube. want get back working it’s hard lately. experience COVID like worse longer lasting flu affects breathing senses. Let's say 5,000, 31 million doses distributed, would 0.01%.

Panera reportedly throws 40% bread. saying. Pfizer ships vaccine special box kept storage temp dry ice, pharmacy replenish 24 hours arrival 5 days arrival. pain still ship pharmacy. 

The J&amp;J vaccine definitely easier tho, I'll much enjoy deal logistics giving 2 shots vs 1 health experts warn us possibility start?? /s  Exactly. patient, definition, admitted hospital. According worldometers stats looks like outcome there's around 3% death rate currently, equates 284,000,000 million people. 

Current population USA around 328,000,000 actually quite lot people. 

Also, we're damned lucky covid higher mortality rate current response world would dead. could cite source overflowing hospitals last 4 years due flu? got March 2020, following flight Eastern Europe. Sickness, diarrhoea, 2 weeks feverish heavy flu like symptoms sense taste smell. Breathing got bad enough get inhaler Doc. Thought asthma, wheezy, unable get full breath in. Nearly year later, still tired, fuzzy brained breathless going stairs walking. Haven’t back Docs, feel well par. anything done? get checked out? Reluctant waste Doc’s time given U.K. health service pressure. 48 yr old female, previously fit healthy. last year's numbers flu burden page cdc website shows (i'll give midpoint there's range) 47,000 deaths 23,000,000 visits doctor, 575,000 hospitalizations, 43,000 deaths. another site could find average 5-6 days average length stay.

the average length stay covid 8 days (with lot ICU), 400k deaths, overall there's 350/100k hospital stays vicinity 900k. 

just using two numbers would peg covid approximately 50% worse flu far hospital burden, based testing confirmed cases covid versus mathematically estimated model flu presumably covid number higher. makes sense death rate covid currently 8 times higher flu headed towards 10x higher time hit one year point make close apples apples comparison. makes America joke What’s absolute disgrace dithering around distribution we’re afraid somebody “less worthy” get shot. states petrified ending Twitter exact scenario described it’s slowing rest down.  Yeah, bit smell training. 3-4 strong smelling things use times day.
My sense smell getting better, morning almost back completely gone... wtf. Parris Island height summer light duties fallbacks stress fractures. think one girl got cellulitis 25 mile hump couple trying Nope there. 

What whole time light duty? Like police base scrub brass? Rake sand, lol (that one favorite, actually).  

I'm impressed able conquer enough finish. must stamina goddamn racehorse something. I've walking pneumonia walk across room. still young! would much helpful patients perspective hear "" know, I'm willing explore options you"" rather putting back patients mental health. talk matters, leaving way, patient feeling wrong, hurts psychosomatic feedback loop described doc above.  far understand, I'm scientist, may last long, possibility even vaccine may never heard immunity, case would support indefinite lockdown, occasionally lifted feature life? Well, least *some* hope getting better time - whereas dick usually untreatable chronic condition. Ah wouldn’t Monday morning wasn’t scolding world. That's far left thing whatsoever. Yep anecdotes make great headlines stories tug heart strings anecdotes. People understand that, even though teenager died Covid, odds literally 1 million. teenagers subject many 1 million risks like car accidents brain eating bacteria aww cute tragic happened her. Apologies wrong. 
Your lexicon needs helps. word looking condolence.

Nobody pretending anymore sticking social distancing rules going meaningful impact cripples economy.

Late lockdowns emergence new variants lead UK one worse hit countries. 

Even vaccinate faster pretty much anywhere else hospitals close capacity 3rd national lockdown. 

Perhaps thing UK 'world-class' pandemic vaccinations point remaining option. actual fuck!!! much love activity MMA BJJ, god sports filled worst human beings I've ever met.

They good started nothing else available. point needs standard. 8=====D\~\~ LMAO, beyond help. logic China Australia, locked HARDEST country--you could even legally travel states countries, raging pits Coronavirus. Yet best country world... hmm work? Especially country one. read last German point view, Italian Prime Minister knowingly told half-truth. Wednesday morning, apparently press conference, health minister Roberto Speranza called German ministerial colleague Jens Spahn (CDU) confronted him. Spahn explained position shortly afterwards federal press conference, question Italian news agency Ansa. 
The agreement EU, according Spahn, **referred round purchasing negotiations long concluded. that, everyone free place additional orders.** deliveries EU, vaccines proportionally distributed member countries, affected this. **The legal texts translated Italian European Union clearly use Italian term procurement procedure (“appalto”) purchasing NZ actual lockdown since August half lockdown anyway. last real lockdown March May. handled 8 community outbreaks contact tracing only, restrictions. could got zero cases tolerance single new case appearing. 

But sizable outbreak escaped contact tracers would lockdown would totally support that. fast need days 2 4 weeks. bad episode early December. 13-year-old admitted children's hospital's psych ward. let first, full. spend time medical ward waiting for.a psych floor room. child going adult hospital, said visit due Covid. spent 8 days three weeks outpatient. therapists said needs back school structure. schools may may reopen February. older kid told kill take virtual summer school. He's failing classes (our district remote since March) first time. Remote learning devastating. livid school board teachers' union. compromise found. They're busy attacking creating performative PR moments. kids continue suffer. feel special ed kids especially. anger toward reopening kids astonishing. medical necessity school! Special ed teachers vaccinated healthcare workers. many mistakes. long chick wearing mask, fine. 24,2+4,4 = 28,6% around 30%. Lmao article fuck bad  risk other's lives way

You every time drive car. Yes, looks projection area ""today"" line shows cases indeed started drop. bit ""today"" projection based current policies. news: inspector caught camera revealing coronavirus manipulation Wuhan pandemic Skipped approval process, necessarily vaccine development. reduced likely know exactly much. think people feel way Nope

Also Norwegians come said deaths unlikely result vaccines 

So case closed really forsee altering behavior (aside less anxiety, general) I'm vaccinated know likely spread virus, asymptomatically vaccination.   variant — known L452R — first detected Denmark March since confirmed dozen states, including California, May.

They know contagious resistant vaccines Yes, ignoring reasons case, different time.

Stop spreading disinformation. thinking Japan ""as long wear mask whatever want"" course completely wrong. Lol @ single men care Super Bowl. Typical misinformation sub.  almost certainly kinds people Japan.   Makes sense. Excess deaths nationwide 18%, compared 24% Texas.

NYC 66% wish places Japan took seriously. ride trains lately see people without masks wearing incorrectly. day even anti mask demonstration right outside busy station maskless people yelling right everyone's faces. People need wake fuck here. denying approvals far ""emergency use approvals?"" means something skipped. NZ govt clear that, lucky position needing rush, able sit back make sure get best safest many vaccines coming out. 

Once herd immunity open border 1 case lead exponential growth would now. Right 1 case many R0. vaccination R rate slashed near 0 fine. Separation state religion when?? Facebook wack. deleted long time ago. never cool tbh. even want solely way message friends. People braindead senses humor, worldviews, memes, shit. experience, least. Take grain salt. Fb groups fan community godawful too. remember DBZ group. People baffled ignorance stupidity. good group ever dedicated wholesome Fire Emblem group good times man. read potential sterilizing / mucosal immunity current (and upcoming, i.e. J&amp;J / AZ) vaccines? try stay current me, that's one last true unknowns regard major dynamics curbing pandemic. live freely new conditions

This makes very, nervous. told put zoom lectures, zoom christmas, allowed travel meet friends world's economic elite absolutely entitled fun weekend Singapore. aren’t majority vocal minority many politicians pandering didn’t die *from* vaccines, reactions *caused* vaccines?

COVID logic goes ways, assuming give shit consistency. UK one noteworthy mutation ways worse (less severe transmissible), whereas many mutations towards less harmful variant.

The British variant severe transmissible. previous mutations less harmful. Afaik variants emerged proven less harmful.   Also this. want see gf Valentine’s Day :( it’s long 10 months without lot people dying COVID, I’d hardly say we’re “dying droves.” point though, lasting protection, shouldn’t freak every little mutation  need travel work. tested positive COVID two weeks ago prerequisite test allowed travel internationally. sick time, nothing major, feel right rain now. I'm worried I'm going test positive again. Everything read says could test positive three months recovering.  


Again, work, think management going happy tell can't travel sick. workaround this? airlines allow board able show fully recovered longer sick still testing positive? Midwest never saw holiday surge. 

I’m really sure anywhere maybe California. Pretty much, every “holiday surge” doom post nonsense. 

So pretend holiday surge happened claim declines result end surge never happened?

That’s weird. thing sucks signed unlimited classes hit. wanted make point places good job monitoring it. trust gyms much people go. found 24/7 gym go empty. This. Glad got straight Even Cuomo Lightfoot saying reopen aren’t dumb know cities states breaking point.

True. faith Pritzker anything reopening wag finger case counts. Lightfoot pushed hard keep restaurants open last fall, mysteriously pivoted ""support favorite restaurants takeout"" one talk governor. UK nurses rubish.  thinking same. feeling sorry obvious mental issue(s) hope gets compassion help.

Don't Japanese wear masks given time anyway? Like, even pandemics happening, wear masks public, thought. think he's empty room? Man damn sources! hate articles don’t link anything!  TL;DR: FFP2 masks – also known respirators – higher filtering capabilities surgical masks, expensive (1-5 euros each), available free population. it’s America since May issue strain news? Ok.  really believe you. Seriously. took family Hershey Park last July. got shit people online (FB) anyone else. Park nearly empty. hotel pool ourselves. great time. Got back home. Quarantined two weeks(WFH) Covid. 

Only bad part trip blew knee two weeks prior walking hurt. ended DVT diagnosed November. planning taking kid two kids friends Orlando graduation June. I'm going stop. going lot careful. Plus, folks vaccinated. Yeah funny/ironic critical thinking type problems see math books, millions upon millions people heavily lacking it. feel like can't really teach anyways. like can't teach creativity people. something either born born with. yoga daily, home, Dog App. Works great, much cheaper, need mask, risk getting infected. Unless fact peer reviewed chalk journalists know talking saying vaccine programme done. I'm saying must continue done NZ, regardless finished elsewhere. NZ reaches 90% vaccination could open border.

You said, another comment NZ expects nothing less elimination. cannot open borders point ever achieve this.

I referring lockdowns, border closures. Thanks I'm going look back obsession death counts unbelievable. tell anything what's actually happening covid never includes context. clearly meant create fear/panic/compliance, that's it. morbid focus distracted people constructing conversations, someone inevitably exclaim ""but 40 thousand people *dead*."" ok karen, understand people dying. way miss point. Could thse states ones getting vaccines done? are, although recommendedations lowered 10 day quarantine iirc. maximum aluminum please Man really got problem reading comprehension. I’m treating like flu. Besides that: flu strains significantly deadly arguably worse covid.

But vaccinating MIGHT similar Stop shrill, views caused deaths, power side total control covid policy. also demographics make easier parts Canada. heard rumor new variant San Jose California. might come news next couple days. Worst part due mutation seems occurred virus, worry current vaccines effective. Here’s hoping that’s incorrect. Heard doctor seems get information news releases it. sure. guiding rules point. Closer scientology science. Doomer article. need find something new ""vaccines take years develop"", ""vaccine trials fail"", ""vaccines serious side effects"", blah, blah, blah stories turned nothing.  freak incident  Half-assed and/or partial lockdowns work. science definitive point now. surely understand context meant? mean literally poisonous substance per gram know humanity? Nah, fine I'll look great! may offer more!

It may win lottery then, omg would virus money? Alabama's 7 day average 2000, peak 3,000. drop almost third. Either herd immunity vaccines starting help, probably herd immunity since vaccine rollout slowest nation here. Funny since one promoting position direct opposition facts result thousands unnecessary deaths. position backed actual results. need mask, need socially distance, live normally lockdowns work. notice respond replies pointing success lockdowns NZ Vietnam, response. risky all. US approaching 900k vaccinations per day already. J&amp;J and/or Astrazeneca likely approved time next month, boosting supply even further. neither needs specialized refrigeration equipment. result covid vaccines finding way normal pharmacies country. 100 million jabs 100 days would actually huge disappointment. stupid title, ""...vaccine panel predicts"". Really, need predict change coming. wonder piss poor rollout. Stop trying predict, get ass something today, tomorrow, next week, month.....

I realize states already adopted new strategy. Here's great Twitter thread Dr. Angela Rasmussen cuts bullshit. Included background thinks vaccination likely greatly reduce virus hits immunized host, dead end. Even immunized people become asymptomatically infected shed virus infect unvaccinated people, unlikely would result transmission another vaccinated person. typical virus behavior.  Amazing happen people take responsibility, government places restrictions place! Good great job! I’ve since January 23rd. I’ve watched repeatedly fail,the worse failure beginning things could different.

EKG echocardiogram going detect cardiac scarring. need contrast MRI rule out.

Sorry loss.  West: going lead race!

\*Hava Nagila gets louder background\* understand push investigate. guilty, would hide evidence. (ie., lab logbooks etc). guilty, chance tracking origin point. Either way, waste time. 

We still know HIV came from. theories. can't think single viral illness say 100% confidence originated. problem goes like this... natural immunity work strain vaccine either likely. heard Brazilian doctors 1% reinfections I'm hugely concerned watching. someone knowledge expand this? looks like brand new problem:

 WORRISOME \*E484\* MUTATION—New study blood 44 people infected 1st wave Africa tested new variant (501Y.V2)—found antibodies \*\*21 44 recognize\*\* new B1125 variant—Almost half!   YOLO people gotten infected vaccines rolling out. Surges unless freak dangerous mutation occurs. studies say. He’s saying people vaccinated every couple months. He’s even saying people vaccinated regularly.
It might limited risk population only, like flu wore fucking masks couple months would over. point, god damn fault. Since idiots complaining economy prolonged pandemic, need stop coddling morons. could lot reasons, make pause acknowledge deep uncertainty still exists immunity. reason soccer players/teams got testet thousand times month earlier visitors old peoples homes... really sad need keep antibodies present, seems like children barely need antibodies T-cell driven immunity driving bus. T-cell immunity long lived, similar diseases lasted 12 years. necessarily work elderly, even really big concern. Valentine's day St. Patrick's day far hang restaurant bar holidays.  know last two things there's effective way find out.

There multiple sites tracking lineages found, though. I've never really gone rabbit hole figure best one.  yes does.

&amp;#x200B;

ten ***one day.***

the ""normal"" rate 1 100,000

&amp;#x200B;

they stopped distribution ***THAT SPECIFIC BATCH.*** kind people understood actually works probably still stuck inside emails leaked hacker attack, right know unaltered? people sell early access? race vaccines stupidity It’s pretty high percentage (experts putting it’s younger, healthier, mild cases.

It’s also *you* - it’s place social world, ability infect others. better states like NY closed much could. general, looking europe too, correlation deaths/capita strictness measures. I've always thought little odd degree try talk ""we know vaccine prevents spread"".

Like true know, pretty solid guess does. Repeating makes sound 50/50 case 100 days May 1st. doubt people keep compliance even long. notice anything P1 variant less severe symptoms ? infection rate still high trailing symptoms still lethal. That's worse immunity ""less effective"". That's immunity failing many people. Yeah definitely. first dose provide significant amount protection(near 50% think), takes week two kick in. got vaccine couple days ago, immunity really started build up. Probably like 5% protection right now. Without regulations get scenario.

""we vaccines available would gone waste however, got lucky used spare vaccines $10k head Party fundraiser happened held near clinic"" Calm buddy take breath, I'm side honest. Actually quite offensive turn ""dirty foreigner"" talk. 
You need stop assuming I'm discussing numbers somehow think clear. not, UK messed big time testing example. Reddit place discuss things like numbers calculated.
It's fact lot controversy countries Covid reporting. pointing out. Reality utterly fucked going hurt lot people everywhere. feel like place be, afraid don’t job credit score yet, can’t abruptly leave expect things work out. want get don’t know start. Um, what? know precisely virus spreads transmits--through droplets air, expelled infectious people coughing breathing. rare cases spread fomites surfaces. contentious disputed view, facts even stands behind now.

California strict lockdowns either. Malls open, outdoor eating allowed, people travel freely anywhere suggestion stay home (no enforcement tickets/fines). lockdown. Wuhan's lockdown went outside house arrested fined. sound like religious zealot. yes, im surprised found one person sick lmao. really realistic all. Maybe lala land


Thinking people getting vaccinated every months...sure Imagine people got it, asymptotic, blue start feeling like they're falling apart. know happened, got ""a cold.""(they test me) Ever since I've tired, severe muscle aches night, generally feel like crap. think got covid work place taking precautions, almost everyone caught it, I'm symptoms long covid whatever call it.

This could really bad considering many people this. know, like plenty viruses, could spring back later life good reason possibly kill you. Theres alot scientists though. Who's science talking about? Lol 
Bro I'm asking questions! agree military spending outrages, but, pass universal federally-operated healthcare country, best, Uncle Sam provide funds enable distribution vaccine. funds used responsibility state, county, private sector. However, would possible VA hospitals, fall defense budget. likely combination people lower titers, people get first time, people brought elsewhere. Like small towns Amazon much immunity. highly skeptical many reinfections bunch maybe relatively small percentage like five. misinformation, speculation. realistic one Well... good news bad news guess. successfully move people vaccination process helps people fence decide participate. 

Can’t say plane people pessimism though. It’s grind goal posts moved many times. big lesson trusting people truth. Politics aside contradictory false messaging government scientists throughout last year major issue. views promoting mass death economic destruction good reason. utterly ashamed utterly repugnant views. sheer ignorance needed promote stunning deny evidence success elimination Australia NZ. karma would experience long haul Covid realise error made. vindictive anger isn’t healthy friend province. eradicated virus. fucking malls open strict lockdown. figured California failed contain virus. come 62,5%? medical condition (type 1 diabetes). want people suffer protect risk. don’t want people miss school, birthdays, weddings, funerals, graduations account. I’m old also want people miss lives protect me.  Yeah would add distant (3) takes supply away healthcare workers....


Either way would rather see people overprotecting wearing flimsy fake “surgical” mask mouth leaving noses out. Anything protect others win. tracked political beliefs CA getting sick, suspect find distinct trend. avoid fines, public people may need do, suspect gathering friends family watch ball games, otherwise exposing themselves. behavior may increased fact offsetting impact lockdown, seek socialization. gives fuck, makes difference!! 85% people got covid reported wearing mask... Reddit propaganda, everyone wakes live normally again.... Eradication already happened home province. government government accepted COVID part normalcy. saves lives costs money long run. That's good reason ""waste"" money. Wooo hoooo! source that? football programs major schools typically fund sports, athletic departments lose money overall, going pot. football actually losing money, keeping everyone else afloat. Yup, that’s exactly feel too. mask around roommate well, carry sanitizer everywhere (and HATED hand sanitizer this). health important body permanently altered insecure POS couldn’t put mask. It’s reckless. anti-viral masks make feel bit better. There’s positively charged textile layer explodes viral envelopes microbial cell walls. It’s tested works (I believe positively charged ions sanitize warehouses well), makes feel bit better about. Here’s Manaus, Brazil, variant evolved 76% population coronavirus antibodies October. level natural immunity good enough keep variant collapsing medical system Manaus past weeks, including grisly story people suffocating beds ran oxygen. That's really sad. friends chill family stay with? hell read lmao. years?

You need move live life fear.

I get cautious, there’s insanity isolating years vaccine administered.

Do favor move out. cares try stop you, it’s life end day. million dollar question. Current research pointing towards, outright saying vaccinated much less likely spread virus.

There research showing can, however, see scientists authority say ""We know can"" ""it's known"", ""people vaccinated may still spread"" something like that. abundance caution, interpreted ""we know vaccinated people spread it"". I’m lucky live area. good here, it’s easy forget serious covid elsewhere.  thing community spread going low within two three months. We'll see things look Easter. would suspect cases 75+% nationally then. 90 95% May 1 back normal actually really happen. places repeal mask mandate July 4th places may keep going winter still probably small number cases fall winter. California stringent regulations area- also would imagine people would skittish much cremation going on. 

Seems easy area regulate South Dakota’s deaths/capita compare states’ rates? yeah think making fun PPEs look wrong message middle outbreak. Masks filters first foremost protect others. chic fashion statements.

I'm mind someone finds something helps feel comfortable something increase (1) risk (2) risk, I'm going delve fashion analysis. We've got bigger issues. Define ""many"" eat restaurant vaccinated. Promise.  Well specific cases could opt vaccinate.

Australia relatively free/entirely free covid-19 old person already hospital battling another disease might better without vaccine.

But 99.9% people get it. Hospitals management science suddenly bad lockdown management, multiple countries around world, time. Lol 🤣 grandmother found lung cancer passed Swim Park ""entry"" area super humid vacation (This 8+ years ago). tests week came back negative. KNEW going die cancer, since breast cervical cancer (Way take EVERYTHING woman...). random water park gave us information, sadly vacation. let in? tragic course I'm basically asking forced complicit. yet, think makes sense. specialist told seeing around 13% Covid patients admit Pulmonary Embolism seems like correlation. covid going around us got deodorant Xmas. Sprayed smell shit. like ""fuck. covid"" luckily made tired Thankyou 1st wave.

This still first wave states. Thankyou Thankyou That’s true all. Someone goes doctor gets prescription expectorant patient even “definition”. Safe say one didn’t 5% global impact one had. Americans idiots - me, different kind idiot starters, disobey order newsom :)

also breed. Good hope happens ex indeed Covid. Since playing Russian roulette child. decided live fear it. Stupidity. Putting child risk everytime timeshare. Instructing child remove mask. ex fever sense taste. surprise. took seriously. Christian I'm idiot thinks God science. 
Be smart people, protect children. least children give damn catching it. people saying madness keep borders closed. What's madness letting people inside country potentially virus killing hundreds more. what's best country.

Hell, live near metro victoria quarantine nightmare , least over. Also, borders problem people work live different state get exemptions cross over. Since Australia's big pop. Density pretty low, people live rural change much, since interact many ppl anyways.

I close family UK, id never want come go see them, risking lives process. 

After all, think many us problem Australia sacrificing comfort lives. flu. Sucked. got covid right healed. super chill me. basically tired smell anything. guess lucky. mom. we're two sisters. Even grandfather okay.
But stepfather got pretty bad. recovered that's good. Extreme clickbait Disingenuous suggest land border closed extent equal Australia (or NZ Taiwan matter). remain largely dependent significant flow land transportation food goods persists despite border closure. Beyond number travellers meet broad categories essential work related travel, example would nurses live Windsor work US cross back forth daily. refuse challenge alternatives attempt enforce quarantine them.

So alone transportation island concept flawed. 

We indeed also fail appropriately secure air travel using federally run quarantine facilities successful nations have... strict air porous land would lead virus arriving regardless.

Unfortunately state community spread even (public political) anymore truly shut borders would largely irrelevant. We'd capable continuing dramatic local spread. main benefit would potential reduced risk infectious variant. need ""community immunity"" for, work well nation tried it. We'll vaccines soon, plus fraction deaths less economic damage. Glad someone saying it. 

I personally care extra doses empty vaccination slots go young healthy people. Throwing doses worst outcome all. 

But NJ, family friend mine 62 years old great health particular qualifying conditions, yet 23 year old child eligible vaccine smokes 3-4 cigarettes day eligible. 

It's absolute disgrace. Stop buying hype vaccine death rate elderly

I think early talking ""vaccine death rate"" especially compare COVID know pushes elderly death rates far they'd otherwise be. add this, addiction formed primary care physician, speak addiction painkillers (narcotics opioids) plan place future medical pain relief avoids class drug, gives reduced dose  post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* know much J&amp;J protect estimates saying 80-85% efficacy. honest possible real world there's much difference 85% 95% efficacy, especially avoid 90-99% severe cases caught COVID October. symptoms milder common cold, except losing sense smell 3 days. recovering started respiratory problems, day. mate got grilled PCSO going shop get food &amp; son he's 'fine' go work, works mattress makers, hardly I'd call 'essential'  Damn nobody got r/unexpectedoffice lol expert 😊 say hospital management, lockdown nothing this. exactly things work. pretty much basis celebrity endorsement marketing. true. J&amp;J AZ vector vaccines. There's vaccine type approved (the Johnson Johnson Ebola version COVID vaccine, adenovirus vector). Um house? tf supposed do, leave? didn’t plan either. Yes. people extremely hysterical elderly dying COVID. Younger people low IFR rate, comparatively.

It seems hypocritical extremely concerned COVID death rate elderly, vaccine death rate elderly. Look armchair epidemiologist. Well, first J&amp;J release data, rumoured come January 21st Monday next week latest. FDA take couple weeks look data set date final vote vaccine's approval...I take less week half - two weeks. guess professional athletes would vulnerable impacted. lose even 5% cardio ability outclassed world class athletes Soz guys, every man themselves. 

Once we're done, we'll concentrate countries. is. hahahaha sure. another 150 million get Covid then. rank countries worst best total deaths see countries top vaccinating heavily. 

That would seem indicate vaccine going places be, pandemic worst. 

Giving low income countries low income even deaths seem good way reduce total amount deaths world.  again, lockdowns, hospital management. lockdowns, hospital management.  confusing doses courses. everyone gets two doses. mean current vaccine requires ultra expensive refrigeration killed 23 elderly Norway? Nah thanks, we're fine. anti-mask sister continues proclaim ashamed family members afraid virus choose live fear. I’m sure talk ever COVID-19. No, Sanofi vaccine bad phase I/II results reformulate vaccine people sharing spreading fake news

If come across it, please become superspreader guess right... plus generates click revenue. Initially, journalists arrived Wuhan January 19, 2020, severity virus still unknown human-to-human transmission yet result, citizens responded relatively nonchalantly questions outbreak. People wear masks called worse flu, bad SARS outbreaks 2002 2004, killed almost 800 people “When arrive, people seem fear concern virus all. haven’t even heard it,” Jun wrote **“A stall owner asks take mask. says ‘You obviously over-worried outsider. Everything fine here,'” Jun continued.**

Obviously store owner time going based limited information. year later people still think mask wearing reaction. 

So China trying keep things secret? 

It could wanted avoid mass hysteria people flooding hospitals. maybe knew possible lab leak? 

Personally understand shame would virus mutated country country saying ""hey problem"". Jesus, symptomatic? so, r.i.p! post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* don’t need Microsoft this. actually yellow vaccine paper I’ve used years  Belgium exceeded 1% vaccinated.

Only 8 years go! I'm favour lockdown proved works people stick rules unfortunately,despite restrictions always rule breakers, Supermarkets one worst spreading Covid.Despite pledges,Supermarket staff real authority asking people sanitise wear mask effect different shop.
In experience worse offenders Aldi, Tesco,Home bargains BnM Spanish flu disappear all. mutate less deadly form lingered recombined another bird flu 50s 60s swine flu 2009 jumped humans pigs 1919!

All strains pulmonary flu currently going around traced back Spanish flu.

In total 100-200 million people died Spanish flu descendants since initial outbreak. Remember - hUrR DuRr, WoRSt FlU!’ remain long term vaccine. right, stay long actual sickness best require vaccination antibody test think guys overstating, huge margin, much money would earned jacking price $20/30 vaccine folks. 

And you’re understating damage would do, people see vaccines distributed need (so remove restrictions earlier) wealth...thereby guaranteeing stay lock much longer (as wouldn’t make headway hospitalizations deaths) forcing even people become unemployed and/or homeless. Japan? work small, private college WV, employer vaccinating us waves since late-Dec. local senior center vaccinating weeks well. temp, drive-thru vaccination station running consistently well. 

I friends public school teachers still waiting get vaccinated. That’s disappointing news state I’ve heard far. secure mask first helping others. Could long covid post covid recovery fatigue also narcolepsy? Guess we'll find months. NJ here, close 3x deaths per capita basis CA plenty economic damage well. strong contender worst state nation going let CA get ahead us now! Machines electronics ww2 huge leap forward time prosperity social change could paralleled happens biotech pandemic. already brink vastly accelerated now. Oh, want police enforce petty laws? we've example example happens cops that? someone fights, tries pull cops gun gets shot headline ""white cop shoots black man mask"" like ""white cop shoots man sleeping wendy's"" dui attacks taser gets shot.

Not going happen. Congratulations, right blew idea expertise authority left blew idea legal authority. point, unless violent crime committed, better come better solution try call cops. Policing dead American cities. asking users download app akin UK? governments actively monitoring location data handsets belonging tested positive Coronavirus? “I’m getting vaccine it’s natural organic” 

“ma’am...have seen face” I'm sure Australian citizens abandoned abroad delighted. Likewise people family living abroad seemingly never see going every precaution premature infants NICU back June July. Mask, near obsessive hand washing, leaving house basically except go NICU see babies.

Come find hospital rash people showed absolutely symptoms lo behold show antibodies. thought asthma episode since experiencing symptoms back July. Completely stopped going NICU case.

I can't completely fill lungs without hurting. whole body hurts, joints, tendons, muscles, everything. barely even hold babies long enough take change diapers. able feed full bottle months. doctor complete loss. rheumatologist went gave cortisone shots nothing pain gotten worse. disregarded saying help barely move told go PT. I'm currently trying find different rheumatologist second opinion accepts insurance I'm horrible fucking fog time pain barely manage anything all. life basically constant game seeing long distract pain get something done.

I'm almost certain caught back thing makes sense idea fuck even it. want pain stop. want life back. want breathe without hurting. Concensus....so basically Appeal authority fallacy? faces big pharma stand together render right! 

Let's clear opinion formulated own, wearing tin foil hat mom's basement. 
I done proper homework putting voice behind words 20+ year PhD Viral Experts alot lose standing big pharma people would like begin understand, unlike Dr fouci actually practiced medicne worked vaccines recent times! 

Killimg people? trains never late discussioms...I'm killing anyone people trying use dead horse narritive getting beyond old borderline crazy. 
This pandemic say I'm gonna sit back powers try act like hope save human race! 

Its madness like claim buddies killing people. Boy sure drink koolaid something tells unable see sweet tastes you. Nectar gods eh?

 lost friends due strict lockdown measures seen pain turmoil caused actual virus that's another undeniable fact. Lockdowns BAD could care less anyone preaching point. 

Supposedly 2 MILLION PEOPLE would die U.S didnt lock mask up. Ya everything based bogus misinformation world completely suffered due completely false numbers go figure redacted! 

Talk misinfo, ya whole pandemic full it! 
Watch yourself, see James Corbett debunks Reuters fact check! looks sounds like way number/track us like livestock. I’m anti-vaccine, far it, ridiculous... 

What happens people cannot vaccinated don’t want vaccinated? treated like carry plague refused/shunned? want take another shot math, friend? 1 8 isn’t 3.6% say 2% chance die covid, let's say 0.5% age group (discounting 5-10% long covid sufferers risk need hospitalisation make hospitals full die parking lot).

Great. chance dying vaccine? even close 0.5% (which would translate 150 deaths Pfizer trial). 0.01%?

This literally trolley problem. nothing accept certain risk, something replace much smaller risk resulting choice? Turns lot people _don't_ want pull lever all...

(Also, 23 Norwegians died shortly getting vaccinated (which may may even due vaccine) old multiple conditions. age group, chance dying corona infection well 20%, even close 20% elderly die vaccine. I'd argue anyone dies vaccine would guaranteed goner event actual corona infection therefore long world case.) Yeah not? 

In end minor epidemic like flu. People get vaccines rich countries poor people struggle suffer like diseases. People dying decades come.

And pandemics future well. look back times show lockdowns mask wearing really work done properly.

And people argue vaccines treatments developed added long list diseases simmers around globe.

And maybe one day, vaccine treatment discovered effective cheap rid entirely virus, like pox. places Australia people go vacation? Must travel internationally? pretty huge country. Tedros, mouthpiece China CPC 2021 also kicking morons born here? Exactly! people literally important ICU nurse right now, due disproportionate impact public health. per life saved basis, almost unmatched. Imagine one SCADA engineer went COVID would production lines. Even family members got spared, means time looking them, rather employee focusing expanding production capabilities. key word usually. usually mild, still way worse actual flu, 100x worse colds everyone likes claim flu. work healthcare, everything covid-19 focused now, even services covid-19 focused running reduced capacity due social distancing requirements meaning see less patients day. Mh, least football (soccer) athletes COVID-19 definitely shown weaker performances recovered (e.g. Pogba, Havertz.. name two well-known players). anyone else completely *exhausted* since COVID? three months ago still matter much sleep I’m tired lethargic. I’ve never active person, unprecedented me. Thanks! Enjoy! Natty I’m getting older I’ve debating getting TRT.

as someone whos bodybuilding communities ages, means hes juicing decade lol wouldnt even mentioned natty Preach,most comments thread equating actual scientific concerns anti-vaxx sentiments.  Cook County Judge Susana Ortiz expressed surprise circumstances ""So understand correctly, telling unauthorised, non-employee individual allegedly living within secure part O'Hare airport terminal 19 October 2020 16 January 2021, detected? want understand correctly,"" said prosecutor outlined allegations Sunday.

Meanwhile i'm avoiding airport covid fears Batshit crazy. Politically covering ass they’re scared backlash rise cases despite people vaccinated. 

This virus really skewed peoples perspectives life, governing risk management. don’t think that’s things work. unfortunately exactly what's coming. absolute favorite one person house tested negative, even though multiple symptoms sick. adults house tested positive, swears something else though negative tests. believes false positives real, guess false negatives. tells people Asymptomatic covid get go must able get now. just....it's hard year. say, expert, work area describe, hospitals much say protocols implement, regulators do. know best, even one life saved covid-19 totally worth others die due less appointments unavailable surgical spots hey buddy? Minorities must represent least 1/3 deaths true. OP saying means every minority death must due race. wrong 67% number wrong. Omg bipolar too. hard together :( especially hypomania head going insane stuff body exhausted pain. actual flu years ago. bed three weeks took six months get back physically. 

That flu. Covid worse. Ah bad, shortness breath winded prob thing. Idk, happening last year, noticed heart rate crazy fast would feel light headed half way normal work out. yet another reason vaccine roll needs accelerate every adult medically able needs gets vaccine. good chance vaccines young children approved late year even early 2022 (due ethical concerns trials young children take lot longer adults). 

As adults responsibility get society herd immunity wait long. 

Another year subpar education, reduced access school support systems lack socializing could serious long term consequences children. Isolated cases Europe, prevalent Wuhan. China locked Wuhan rest world could started looking sooner. It’s *obvious* vaccine prevents transmission, way *obvious* cloth surgical masks would prevent transmission. CDC trick saying “well don’t data yet” literally buying study’s worth time get people vaccinated build verification infrastructure, way back buying study’s worth time get mask production ramped meet demand HC workers wouldn’t left cold. think rising death infection 4k people dying day war ""won"", we'll agree disagree. strains real concern. Vaccines surely light end tunnel, everyone going make light.  live alone without interacting people, that's fine. Otherwise, always increased risk community spreading. thing happened Jacksonville Jaguars player. got covid training camp around July/August September basically ruled entire season. He’s still dealing complications. Exactly. hospitals governing bodies decide measures according prevalence, virulence infectiousness virus.

Closing shops pubs last straw reduce prevalence, measures failed.

These two independent: possible close shoe shops pubs, test patients entry vice versa.

However, prevalence extreme hospital outbreaks drastically reduce outcomes personnel availability, seems quite necessary implement strict hygiene measures hospitals. ""mid late march""

which year? Hey maybe talking royal mail kind agree DH part, starting pitchers get play 30 games season spend rest days working eating. 1B least stand probably 90 minutes per game make keeping weight slightly harder. groups vaccine testing didn’t come contact anyone covid placebo groups did? 

Scientists include possibility, calculated likelihood - odds occured 0.001%. Scientists always allow possibility wrong, also math unlikely is. 

Besides, 3-4 successful trials far, odds *all* got good results random chance 0.0000001%. This. vaccinated even reasonably careful, likely good go back old normal. likely true most, certainly all, people natural infections. Try again, 1/8 29,4% 3,675% that, expect valuable vaccines are, transporting smaller batches important layer risk management. small plane crashes, lose small shipment, big one could potentially lose millions vaccines. Even something simple like refrigeration unit plane failing could disastrous put entire stock one shipment. tagged US, Fauci discussing US approval.

It game changer US.

The overwhelming majority people think game changer also think there's huge stockpile ready drop.

Just I'm around group thinking mean I'm wrong. evidence vaccine prevents transmission? haven’t seen any. hasn’t studied yet, though studies way. would’ve one people April insisting everyone wearing cloth/surgical masks idiot really problem tbh - that's 0.3% population per day. UK 0.5% aiming 0.75% month, even want guess Israel doing. taste still bit messed up, thing still taste properly chocolate. Everything else either tasteless tastes weird. March, researchers decided routinely record genetic sequences virus found, giving powerful tool tracking mutations.

Smart decision. read news Americans fleeing Canada ? truth news pretty much described ailments I've never covid. Minus itchy scalp, I'm itchy my... nevermind. mine generalized anxiety. something genetics decided throw way one day. Coming developing country, completely understand countries need take care citizens first worrying countries. Expecting opposite reeks entitlement. flipside harvesting effect cases developing countries virus tends hit older terms deaths heavily number deaths substantially lower developing countries versus developed countries. Unlike previous pandemics hit younger people least decently hard terms deaths, one really strongly hits people age 55 65 terms deaths. Much flu pandemics polio etc , think that's largest cause discrepancy developing developed countries. SARS immensely worse covid-19.

They're SARS Coronavirus... SARS-CoV-1 SARS-CoV-2. Different strains thing: disease 2019 (COVID-19) contagious disease caused severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 Comes waves vaccinating 1% worse wasting doses? Didn’t guys massive problem johnson johnson many lawsuits filed? Sorry missed Europe tag propoganda intended (Russia ?) get rest world careless soon vaccination. possible source doesnt say that. early says pandemic death rate based direct measurements large scale studies done things may changed since then. EDIT: Wow blew up! Well post America (crazy know). Yes! situation you. UK partner US. last March America right shit hit fan. border still shut come caution (he living someone cancer risk catching bringing back one want take). finally worked going come April, right UK says they're likely put quarantine hotels incoming travellers. happens situation you, able come length time would hotel amount time would coming for. even want us stuff outside! sit around place together couple weeks unlikely happen AL WEST day. support DH. 1B/DH thicc boi doesn’t perform way elite pitching/HR hitting chonkolon freak nature does. It’s apples oranges. can’t compare fruit. to, Bartolo wins. organize fundraiser, maybe 5k something.  65 COPD. Anything might cause lung damage scares me, experienced incidents difficulty breathing. disagree.

Why? priority get jabs arms people risk, medical systems stretched.

This is, first time living memory, according case numbers, fatalities, etc... rich country problem poor country problem.

The majority cases deaths taking place rich countries. therefore makes sense places get priority access vaccine decrease deaths stress healthcare systems.

Caveat: turns out, 5 years now, actually lot poor countries completely fucked COVID numbers due lack infrastructure test count, none said would apply.  still bad nearly bad couple reasons... Number one many US virus compared Ireland percentage. Number two dominant March non trivial percentage people vaccinated. hope don’t, would lesson it. Full return form? big deal virus. sucks! also, thread people “mild” symptoms time initial infection. getting COVID news random local news station? guess sensational headline, get upvotes. 

Article uses “some” “many” generally gives anecdotal evidence. give indication rates illnesses. Articles like serve spread fear name getting clicks ad revenue “news” station.   getting higher viral loads, increased potential spread, potential resistance treatments, implications good. guy work got early last year permanent lung damage. He's 26, never smoked life, healthy, pre existing lung issues. he's breath short walk almost year later. I've asthma life want nothing covid. China big vaccine manufacturer. point, hoping avoid Covid almost like hoping avoid getting flu. Let's hope vaccinate shit cause become extinct.  haha March. Body aches gastro pain mine. ""shortness"" breath, get winded super quickly. Sleep restlessness another big one. Loss balance. Tremors. propaganda piece intended prevent chaotic social tension-stricken world overwhelming majority people, unvaccinated, get pissed minority vaccinated get live less restrictive lives, worse yet, say fuckit start disregarding rules deem “unfair”.

It’s exact trick CDC said data backing &lt;N95 masks effective Covid first 2 months pandemic. knew data would inevitably exist, clever lie omission bought time keep masks healthcare key public-facing workers public run masks would start.

They’re trying get enough people vaccinated cases actually start going seriously businesses governments get vaccine verification infrastructure together telling public vaccinated people live different rules. dude, allergic reaction nothing unusual. already 42 millions vaccinated persons. happens every then.

**(PREPRINT) Epidemiology post-COVID syndrome following hospitalisation coronavirus: retrospective cohort study:** Ayoubkhani, Kamlesh Khunti, Vahé Nafilyan, Thomas Maddox, Ben Humberstone, Sir Ian Diamond, Amitava Banerjee

doi: article preprint certified peer review \[what mean?\]. reports new medical research yet evaluated used guide clinical practice. Clickbait. discovered last year multiple countries.

[Here’s another say L452R variant linked several outbreaks Santa Clara County first identified last year countries states. 0.57% = 1/500 chance anyone dying anyone Norway infected covid. chance 80+ year old dying covid would much likely. Perhaps 1/100 chance.

Once everyone mass-vaccinated, unlikely lockdown stop spread. also unknown well vaccines actually stop spread. Therefore there's good chance 80+ year old infected within year.

In case, decision 80+ year old something like:

\[OPTION 1\] 
1/1000 chance dying within week vaccine

VS

\[OPTION 2\] 
1/100 chance dying within year covid originated less densely populated agricultural area exports UK. UK quite densely populated, highly connected, cold/wet winter, know virus spreads quickly places like meat processing factories, cold, wet, densely populated. ⅛, also know 12,5% hundred dying day US, many experts said winter going bad. 4k dying day. hype. happened worst anyones expectations. people saying new variants pose large threat. really hype? Look chart Ireland explain hype. sad disease effects elderly. Average age COVID death ~80 covid around October think. Though taste back, everything tastes like diesel now. you? It’s really strange many people insist masks nothing dare question One thing sure, THRILLED young children right completely different developmental stages (4 &amp; 1), nowhere go nothing do!

So pleased wife leave workforce care kids people could big ole' family Christmas dinner. /s Jesus Christ, death inevitable. don’t wrap Saran Wrap. Lockdowns restrictions suck. aren’t meant live way. feels like punishment many violating rules right start giving anyone wants scheduling priority said guidelines.

This thinking actually incorrect. much higher death rates elderly, important give doses right groups anyone else. fact much important point tossing 1 dose away giving 1 someone 70 better randomly vaccinating 2 people. 

Without accounting herd immunity, vaccinating one person 70 better vaccinating 10 18 year olds. reason consider herd immunity main vaccination strategy yet 200 million doses available. cigarette exemption New Jersey complete joke entirely counter science this, suggest smokers much less likely get virus less likely bad outcomes. Ehhhh. Covid I’m vaccinated Pfizer vaccine. got second dose last week. chance knowing side effects mild I’d take J&amp;J. second dose Pfizer treat well. Felt like full blown flu 3 days. hope we’re able get shit together distribution. absolutely ridiculous. work school would anything get vaccinated right now, there’s guidance even proceed. back feeling like Pulmonary Embolism. took several days blood thinners kick couple weeks could sleep normally get rid cough developed. discovered paralyzed diaphragm right lung CT scan seeing specialist determine next steps. possible could awhile causing issues. guess kind lucky caught start medication it.

So, like, 20% time school? that's assuming vaccine kids become available 2022, much guaranteed yet. think good new variants found

That means testing well there. This. I'm scared dying covid, thats common age group. long term health impairment is. 

I already asthma. already know feels like can't breathe. Like hell ill put situation might make worse life me. improved pessimism probably well placed. said next weeks going worst deaths. quick reduction suspect get March Except part Covid already circulating Europe back 2019 even reasonable expect China identified new virus locked down. born England, make English.

From another source

 [Moradabad hospital ward boy dies COVID-19 vaccination, officials say death due heart disease vaccine - points rare superspreader event school follow procedures. school spread issue it'd one school. think testing parents part protocol. Main goal see kids truly spreading undetected. not. Full virtual start with, gradual moves hybrid way go, shouting best could, obvious going complete cluster fuck wishful thinking switching virtual/hybrid/in-person teachers expected somehow deal nonsense, hard enough normal years.

So refreshing rational discussion here. Let's enjoy mods shills come online nuke/downvote everything :)  true, J&amp;J 3rd phase results expected today? Probably unemployed people. Stress levels real lack assistance. too! there's much info people presenting aftermath symptoms months later really want know patterns  That's great! We'll start see deaths hospitalizations dropping group protected. r/conspiracy user btw Yeah, happening ever?

I see restrictions place stay, ebbing flowing. get freedom stance comes least, think it’s actually bit paradoxical, temporary lockdowns, strict enforcement strong compliance ensure freedom (not freedom government restrictions freedom threat disease economic freedom people avoid public spaces widespread disease regardless restrictions) maximized long term restrictions last shortest time period possible.

Like stated uninterested debate though. correct. People get symptoms lots viral infections symptoms limited covid. Almost everyone bar small minority individuals fully recover time. absolutely pointless arguing types. Also: UK variant around consistently since *september*.

They're saying UK gotten cases variant. 

Another take UK got cases different factors (seasonality, low community immunity compared places like Bergamo north Italy second wave preexisting immunity March) attributed increase variant. ""70% contagious"" figure comes controlled studies variant itself, deducted increase contagion - 70% cases ""expected"", means new variant 70% contagious. here, peer reviewed, that's one media used hype ""UK variant"". K. wrong means saved lives? think hate rich people want blame world’s ills. Yes EXACTLY. absolutely Risk assesement. I'm sure people hurt drastically lockdowns actual Covid.

[^(Send ^(|) [^(Github - ^(|) [^(Github - Chrome lot reasons. mostly comes back economics. WWII America pretty much industrialised country industrial base intact. led economic boom America basically collected loans countries supported WWII sold goods rest world. addition Cold War Soviet Union led creation enormous military-industrial complex also made country rich, combined New Deal policies war. America prosperous one point guy without university degree worked car factory Detroit 50s 60s could afford house, car every modern convenience wife stayed home. Think much would earn today buy home, car support family single income. 

Of course, time countries caught - America helped Germany Japan rebuild started making stuff cheaper. American manufacturing struggled make cheaper bosses had, effort reduce power Unions, made systems production inefficient monopoly. 

In 70's Carter administration saw happening realised austerity going become policy America going hold onto power world stage. Carter told Americans wear sweaters instead putting heating on. message tanked, Reagan swept power landslide platform ""regulation taxes holding us back"". 

Behind scenes Reagan pretty much checked out, people told informed policies understood profit could squeezed system, understood Carter administration's message austerity fundamentally correct, ascertained needed left private companies dirty work slowly making people's lives worse, government. 

So people 80's paying less taxes, time single income enough anymore. 80's first decade American history parents working leaving children care people became norm (anxieties led ""Satanic Panic""). 

The fall Soviet Union offered opportunity America cut military budget re-invest people, point people running companies donors sides contemporary political thought saw system put place Reagan inviolate. Clinton put final nail coffin US manufacturing NAFTA ever since American economy become essentially one giant Multi-Level-Marketing scheme defined series ""bubbles"" people scramble make much profit bubble bursts, causing economic crisis government fixes, making banks business whole abandoning normal people caught devastation fate. 

America currently kept afloat mostly US Dollar global reserve currency, keeps inflation artificially low, means country basically forced buy shit people keep system place. Americans material comforts ever lives get worse worse. Gone days expected government's job help old work disabled. expected start delivering GrubHub driving Uber, making profit people top getting none benefits actual employee, enough cash buy food rent takes paycheck first job student loan repayments hoover rest. 

Joe Biden offers solutions. offers practical escape death spiral. Bernie Sanders offered America chance negotiate end US Empire rest world allow American people reclaim dignity able build movement needed face enormous opposition every corner. last year US got choice two old men. angry old man kind old man. offer nothing denial coming. 

The next four years see life getting worse, wages covering less less need misery. thing Biden's administration offer going PATRIOT Act II, forces US security state turned white nationalists domestic terrorists. case ""making everyone's life better"" case ""punish everyone equally"". 

Maybe end decade, maybe next one, see Fall Saigon happening dozens countries soldiers, spies diplomats marched gunpoint waiting planes. happening billionaires funnelling money parties keep people arguing whose fault is. Well, first paragraph opinion, yet presenting opinion. problem much evidence favor it, seeing world still struggles virus places benefit geographic isolation beginning taken measures may legally possible take western world moment. simply lot room debate, even though try deny it, low method push opinion forward. thing black white want present it. lockdowns costs impact, disproportionately poorest socially vulnerable people. remember India locked way forced millions choose trekking hundreds kilometers death starvation? hundreds similar examples around world. them, I'd allow tourists positive antibody tests thoughts exactly! fucking idea. Like said variants around tie including UK one. Nothing unusual happened here. Nothing exploded. 

Since March everything going let's say according plan. Low cases summer thanks warm climate, people going outside exponential growth Winter like told. 

I guess UK scared shit them. afaik Travel banned control. cases found literally flight passengers. frail elderly statisticians epidemiologicalists doctors. read like push selective data analysed experts. Doctors hate diseases like linger know cause. Often start blaming patient saying mental. hope figure help long haulers. Look, could one shot immunity... feel like justice case. risked people's lives careless ""they high risk"".                                         Shame hope unintentionally kill someone jackassery. Yeah :( 

The thing scarier people allowed happen without much fuss. scared too, stayed home months March. I'm rational person, look data. look data way justify this. 

But people look data scared. it

As expected unintelligent response. Things aren’t shady wouldn’t part experiment 

Point proven  friend suffers same, bipolar added. hurts see pain tossed handfuls medications. completely different met 7 years ago. I'm sorry going that... hope psychadelic mushrooms get game fibro turns they're beneficial. here. think it’s dead? I’m assumption I’ll able get vaccinated. (And lockdowns ease ) **If what's causing it, *if*,** kind cost/benefit analysis assess risk side effects versus risk person catching COVID dying passing another person. think international tourism dead good, except rich. makes sad, travelling made happy life. absolutely right. :/ sort scares future flu seasons lead lockdowns. wish people like comments post. science deniers also blindly following alarmist bs. sort middle road approach Covid. withdrawal agreement set terms period transition, say process article 50 finally passed agreement new trade deal. couldn’t agree trade deal years took iron withdrawal terms? Well, that’s EU you. no, haven’t subject full terms EU membership 2020, EU members. signed trade deal weeks ago, left EU beginning 2020, COVID-19. Cancer def caused covid. literally 3 viruses known association cancer understanding one challenge historically lot money make vaccines, incentives bit skewed unless governments large donors willing fund vaccine development. one two extended absences

Which would translate ""many"" statistical terms used.

If doctors see 1,000 patients severe long term symptoms, that's ""many"" patients. 24.5 million confirmed cases many though.

This media reports quite hit miss days. say ""significant numbers"" ""many"", provide zero context. would 100% locked world 2019 flu we're still locked now, policies data based. clearly not. like they're even factoring health, economical, societal costs lockdowns. They're behaving they're literally free. argument people died elderly frail one people use excuse COVID itself... I'm kinda confused here.

Wut? So? elderly frail seems like pretty good explanation person would much likely die regular person reason. And, catch COVID, they're much likely die COVID catch compared younger person partially they're elderly frail. Don’t forget people work home totally good constantly say “just wear mask darn it!!!!!!” Ignoring fact masks utility..they panacea Unfortunatelly PCR tests reliable. chief doctor infectious diseases main hospital told people test positive 3 tests. false negatives (which even worse). Ryquell Armstead entered chat... really great commentary advice thing add still know long term lasting effects could virus. point integration balance interests members bloc whole. France getting something interest one instance means others get something interest (and possibly detriment others) time, business partnership, even friendships, etc. Often things can't get own, UK find services industry. 

This high level horse trading, often beyond understanding people whose minds meant it. Variants around since march. Literally thousands them. They've decided need hyped *now*. makes zero sense.

There's hundreds viruses around. suddenly mutated jumped mortality overnight. looking constantly magnifier. this? immensely true take. Covid become catch taking blame every ill. It’s weird see. risk temporary facial paralysis comparison 2% death rate Covid? formality. Like said, literally every vaccine works kids well adults. thus surmise there's insanely high chance case COVID vaccines too. coworker went sick leave May Yeah. I’ve patient scientists side. literally science major. dang things getting ridiculous there. Politicians seem making decisions based absolute cautious take times. never ever going zero risk somehow discourse now. it’s impossible . know work done vaccines, I'm really hoping find good medications treat covid directly massive lasting damage get it.

From found, drug called Camostat Mesylate promising. developed Japan approved already specific GI problems (I think), seems moderating effect covid. Trials going worldwide I'm like, results? year virus, least trials must finishing soon. need add couple 9 figure :)

But yes, here. Terrified March, left house months. ex-post data starts come online can't help math. data paints picture radically different one painted media policies.

What made hard ""switch"" fact every single government except outliers like Sweden, Florida, South Dakota (where apocalypse happened way) every single media outlet kept repeating things. that? mean, makes sense whatsoever. destroying world know this? would vaccinating children ahead another group? They're last priority group Australia's rollout. seems insane anyone would vaccinating kids (who very, unlikely die COVID) could vaccinating aged care residents (who make half deaths countries). Eduardo, curious sprinting like madman going slow?

We're going fast. We're scrambling panic leadership. Dude hit home run. Sounds pretty athletic also sued, possible.  you’re def alone this. symptoms back july still can’t eat peanut butter use old satsuma-scented body wash smells distorted. also somehow TASTE outside air, makes sense? like every time go outside air tastes like distorted citrus (and distorted citrus scent replaced lot normal scents me—even perfume smells like nasty distorted orange smell). it’s tough deal Stupid regulations get way. Yes, prioritize health workers elderly, extra shots going bad vaccinate anyone willing rather waste doses. many people want it, can't toss doses, thousands dying every day, that's shameful. DOCTORS ones delaying procedures, recommending that. ME. doctors told avoid coming person encouraged hold things done. Yes, that's bad is. Even doctors concerned. Many working virtually lot procedures even hold. 

Businesses open defying stay home orders (when supposed closed temporarily) cases highest ever ICU's 100% capacity, space ER's...ya, thats pretty fucked up. Especially lot businesses even take necessary precautions like proper distancing, requiring masks, etc. 

Essential workers choice go work. get fired. family works health care field. work covid non covid patients risk environments. Luckily vaccine getting rolled now, help. imagine work people care covid, take precautions traveled vacation, got sick...and expose family members work various health care settings? Even PPE, medical professionals still got sick. also friends work retail, school settings. many essential workers kinds. choice go work get fired. Think low income families working low wage jobs need front people every day. definitely choice. community spread *high* higher risk getting exposed. people took precautions community spread *low* would lower risk getting exposed. 

I'm absolutely selfish. live California last weeks huge number cases, hospitalizations, deaths. Public health officials infectious disease experts set regulations allow hospital capacity. people devoted entire lives this. 

What would BEST opinion, based comments this:

Right now, hospitals area ration care. take people follow guidelines, wear masks travel gather others...basically people according ""fear"" send home. get hospital bed. leave hospital beds actually give shit.

Because top medical experts telling order medical resources available need , refuse listen...you entitled services. enough BS fear mongering let's take action. Prioritize hospital beds medical care take covid seriously follow guidelines, everyone else last line. Yeah. It’s absolutely insane people saying travel won’t possible year. idea can’t travel fall winter beyond belief me. We’re literally going 4 vaccines within month note...folks actually die Covid vaccinated. folks saying schools stay closed even staff vaccinated. single country approved yet - we're still waiting studies. Excellent article. finally understand jab received last tuesday was. Ironically, despite literal front-line health care worker, received education new vaccines work. 0.013% risk dying prefer trust immune system. Also don’t like participate experiment things clearly bit shady.  No, UK EU rules regime transition period. left weeks ago, thus new rules. think due exposure, among things blood group, immune system, health aso... think protecting can't (or won't) get vaccinated 5%. 95% figure symptomatic disease. remaining 5% develop symptoms less likely get serious disease. seems like are.

I absolutely favour vaccines ones need (pretty much people need flu vaccine every year). sure vaccines mean we're free again, they've done last year.

One hope look Israel/UK. They're promising lockdowns rules winter 2021 already I'm sure. I’m gonna honest don’t really want debate lockdowns right now. give brief explanation views though. Basically, don’t believe governments enough power idea “lockdowns” forced restrictions businesses people’s private social interactions possible. beliefs lockdowns aren’t specific lockdowns really power governments general control lives citizens. could go depth I’ve reddit way much lately I’d prefer to. Yes.   reality actual cases probably way higher? please live rest life without another pandemic, dont think make 2 pandemics. Alright, let's start recommending oddball remedies here. Advice given physicians, least reflect consensus medical professionals. suggest read actual news instead going straight read comments make own...just saying. replace upholstery. sure downvoted you. People Europe California acted like defeated pandemic Summer Fall, respectively yet are. personally bit cautious. Vaccines? Nah, cabinet fall time! Canada literally runs laps around world terms many doses purchased. production capacity see us lagging early doses, yet we're still sixth best world.

When production properly ramped, Canada flood country doses. Tell it, people got covid stupid. Easily avoidable. Spikes going now, vaccinations going well, J&amp;J vaccine rumored drop phase 3 press release today. thing time estimates work look me! Ermmm half dozen many? age “kids”. exactly science man. anecdote. Like said, comes cost some, know people situations like that. still doesn’t change vast majority citizens back normal lives deal tragedies happening countries. year pandemic she’s gone Kamala Harris Liberal, Tomi Lahren Far Right extremist already prone conspiratorial thinking.

Jesus, that's almost scarier virus... lol

Edit: Timothy Leary quipped LSD drug known causing psychotic reactions people never taken it.

Maybe COVID virus causes right wing extremism people never catch it.

😂

😬 Exactly, bf frequently long distance college (were state students). pandemic much different usual relationship celebrated 4th year together. hard work it, long distance kill relationship someone. Useless statistic unless tell percent population comorbidity... I’m guessing high obesity, diabetes, HBP comorbidities ridiculously common. keep mind mutations random, make virus harmful benign. Let us say 50% direction rush assumption

However keep pandemic going longer time, cannot sure lucky every single time mutates.

The odds low, playing odds time dumb Aw hell no. Give poor man different bed. thats dumb, sign sheet many people line vaccination go that, like ordering delivery.

again attribute incompetence? health workers didnt want get want do? Blow me. second worse he’s start two wars profit.  confirm well, tested positive last Monday told doctor symptoms started maybe 2 days prior. department health calls every 3 days check condition supposedly I’ll able go back work give clear, need get tested again. surprised well, seems much laid back expected. guy set “official channels” state MUST use purchase PPE tries confiscate don’t, would never create plan actually helped people. unless profited. think turning point Anthony fauci said wear mask. saw knew America dead. literally set people's minds solid issue bluegill heating ductwork. advice bad really surprised...? state's fault health worker refused get them?

did want like waitlist something? oh 1 million people sign waitlist, get 1mil vaccines distribution? ya, could see that, know people sign show up?

your plan sounds pretty ridiculous. Shit, pretty scary symptoms, especially know long might last they're going get worse. Glad better. Hopefully get again! think change “proactive vs reactive” nature politics? put precautions place February, could least LITTLE better. forever doomed frog pot slowly boiling water?: anything it’s already late. got sick back February. know had, like flu lasted three half weeks. take multiple days work (unusual me), spent days nights lying sitting couch trying breathe. got bad enough started turning TV night. I'm sure why, think vague idea would less likely stop breathing.

It took months night time breathing go back normal - already bad, sleep apnea, months I'd nights I'd startle awake thinking breathe, I'd rest night.

What never gone away fatigue. even half energy levels did. always enthusiastic worker, nowadays I've really struggled trying get workdays.

I think probably Covid, even though supposedly common. work customer service position regularly handle peoples' electronics, suppose might could encountered it.

Sorry inappropriate place post this. live alone want worry family, really talked much it, I'm scared worried. guess also want say Covid, think probably did, stuff's really scary. Well, know Donald poops drawers.  True, case E-Rod great shape Bcoz Chinese vaccine good 
When ur country cant make getting pfizer . cant india get . assumed chinese ? 
Stop ignorant assuming baseless things . simple google cound hv told u , india hv vaccine . last supper exist. None get excited. opinion: everybody aiming September day day life good. Another school year even remotely like would catastrophic imagine imposing restrictions kids adults live up. According around 1.01 billion  tested positive 2 weeks ago quarantine actually ends today. Anybody lost theyre sense smell long take get back? havent able smell anything week Also COVID bet.

I knew number people got sick (with typical symptoms) right first wave really confirmed US. 

I'm still somewhat convinced least little longer realized, several months more... im going say shouldnt even worry much getting infected there... Drinking coffee tasted like hot water really weird. Here's hoping die early, fellow covid catcher. Honestly, low-risk people taking shit seriously selfish. 

Even long term side effects survivors, fact they're going business low risk still really shitty. We're likely hit 500k deaths time get 1 year mark, people running around like big deal. 

Person catches it, spreads 5 people, 5 spread 5 more, etc. Eventually, people along chain going die. IMO Person bears moral responsibility deaths along chain. China least two exporting otherwise-ignored countries. One Sinovax  rate proportional big fail. sucks hardcore! :/ lost smell weeks taste. Made changing poopie diapers easier. it’s random one day every week two wake can’t breathe. Oxygen drops low 90s high 80s hours. lot people worse don’t like feeling like I’m suffocating breathing. Always goes away thankfully. hope taste come back soon! Everyone deserves enjoy pizza! virus bad enough without taking away pizza too. antibiotic think. think right HIGHEST paid school official almost states basketball football coach. difference pfizer (50's) moderna (80's) protections one shot time found surprising given similar technologies.

Those numbers directly compared calculated different ways. Pfizer's data inset see vaccine group, hardly additional cases cropped later 12 days first dose. ""50%"" efficacy mostly due cases cropped vaccine started work. ignored cases developed within 7, 10, 12 days first shot, could calculate different (much higher) efficacies. However, Pfizer's data first dose goes 21 days since that's second dose given, know long efficacy lasts.

Whereas Moderna's (pg 28) based small subset participants took one dose, follow time longer many (more chances placebo group get sick). 7 vaccine group got sick, 5 first 2 weeks, 80% figure great deal luck involved calculation. Living frustrating. Bars restaurants absolutely jam packed. Even outdoor dining areas room move. get table isolated restaurant dumbasses inevitably going sit smh. I'm surprised knew guy 30's got runs triathlons build houses living. said almost went hospital breathe one point. non professional opinion think it’s possible could mast cell disorder like MCAS, might something mention. think it’s pretty clear there’s differential “should be” is. Whether gap closes, we’ll see. It’s picking steam don’t know yet lawyer work still testing positive 5 months. didn’t bad symptoms, still cannot leave home it. data blind! Riiiiiight.
Maybe non crisis times is. warm sensation stomach hours eat spicy food satisfying (assuming heartburn issues, get sometimes). know why, is. Exactly. let’s forget Americans claiming go “Alaska” aka British Columbia West Virginia exactly known high income state obviously woke solution. Many scientists excited potential motivated. hard get far without adequate funding. main thing changed. Abstract

Using vitro evolution affinity maturate receptor-binding domain (RBD) spike protein towards ACE2, resulted contagious mutations, S477N, E484K, N501Y among first selected. includes British South-African variants.

In weird case immuno compromised people get higher efficacy J&amp;J vaccine. studies done combinations preconditions + age + whatever specific conditions. 

Not likely possible. 

In practice, countries happen vaccines available right ones high efficacy. also seems like good idea doubt anywhere world right what's important vaccinate, matter what. 

All vaccines seem prevent hospitalizations bad outcomes disease that's also important know! Man constant fountain nonsense. TBH doubt it, seems big events/conventions cancelling June now, con go area happens late May announced there's way expect able able host con year awesome vaccines elderly. Moderna Pfizer.

Let less effective vaccines go masses. Less effective vaccines still work fine younger people, better immune system. less effective vaccine effective enough younger people (70-90%). Also they'll probably protect severe disease 100% cases. two great vaccines great numbers probably fill role perfectly. Oxford J&amp;J. Same. saw kids riding around packs. Ball games. Parties. sorts stuff  That's really sad severe side effect come something many people rely on.  weird, painful post covid symptoms. body temperature shifting. Like day 37 C night lower. still cough occasionally, doc said nothing lungs.
As working I've working covid (isolated course) working since, feel difference mental capabilities. got back working out. First day covid hard, cause felt light headed walking one block. gradually went away. getting back heaviee training, like lifting small weights sparring.

I heard stories nurses covid weak month two, like even shift gear cars drive switching channels woth remote hard. recovered.
its crazy differently affects people.

Also mental pressure hard covid, know expect. Lately I've absolutely itching get back gym...

Thanks making feel less shitty that. lol I'd imagine plateau cases. We're end whatever fueling recent spike. Obviously. meant long term symptom. find particular organ tissue damage. he's big..papi Best luck you. hope works well. Sidenote can’t wait someone try take username one day gotta get really creative make username cannot avoid it. prolong long takes reach you. isolated 10 months? Even summer?  Reading sick moderate case covid sucks anxiety lol. horse? Username checks out. believe reach herd immunity sooner later protection vaccines lasts years least. 

The herd immunity values really set stone, course what's preferred reach 100% lower numbers work perfectly line even better diseases. 

Also, vaccines seem prevent worst cases disease hospitalizations that's also good.

You can't really rely vaccine protected yourself. Even 95% 5% 95 go lower time. get vaccine shield. Vaccines work community, yourself. 

But yeah, believe people get vaccinated skeptics enough ruin it. already butcher tons cows food, might well utilize full potential. Many vaccines 90% effective mention preventing serious cases. country 25 million grade health system easily vaccinate entire country keep vaccinated. Yes eventually they’ll open vaccines already even proven effective. number hosts available tiny. Hip pain nowhere. Regardless, late anything take meds even symptoms start. But. 3 medrol dose paks year going cause bad outcomes almost certainly think predictions likely conservative. lot easier jab someone needle swab nose wait results. Testing also slow needed reagent, labs, PPE short supply. comment really fucking dumb. work tourism industry (mostly young people) least affected Covid, bet would much rather work. get Yellow Fever cards going coming specific places actually community transmission Yellow Fever (mainly South America Africa)

Covid passports likely universal thing international travel couple years therefor need separate thing issued everyone get's passport start pandemic, doctors intubating people (putting ventilators) oxygen saturation numbers level low enough warrant it.

However, long doctors realised intubating patients many cases lead worse outcomes using non-invasive ventilation CPAP machines could keep people intubated thus keep people alive.

In end, never needed numbers treatment regiment changed. provided things..contraceptives , pills area . people rigid old school mentallity . thinks children = hands earn house . govt ask send children free education schools ..these parents interested taking children farms work . coworker got covid another coworker “didn’t think big deal” came work anyway smh Missing data..., like Mr. Navalny going missing today... thanks Putin think COVID much deadly think, however. Bayesian analysis testing that’s going on, seems likely lot asymptomatic cases may false positives, meaning lot deaths (which much likely true positives) occur direct result disease.  I’ve worked far right environments too. led wholly reject world view, accept it. 🥂🥂 congrats. thanks service ! Fingers crossed we'll done soon enough Conspiracies allowed sub Definitely effect UK also done excellent job sequencing virus. someone coughs sneezes touches weights. also breath hard spit trying get last rep. loved gym way low risk right now. now, run outside. Who's first what's second know third virus high R0 number people already immunity to? immunity covid given high R0 seeing mass infections. 

What kind dumb question this. Coronaviruses fall sky. natives die infection europeans fine? Immunity. Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, Singapore, Iceland, Vietnam, etc. countries got right first time, government should’ve learned second wave didn’t. 

Sure we’re worst position vaccine situation handled better country arguably. we’ve still significantly cases deaths should’ve per capita. 

And yeah sure people awful following guidance recently, would people listen rules government completely let Dominic Cummings hook? soon let whatever wanted, people decided break rules we. try find actual article (assuming pre-print) find used ""newspaper"" article unedited title. Large part reason I'm avoiding virus like life goal right now. probably die, can't chance hard pin point long term illness derailing whole life. Friday England alone 320,000 doses. would 2.2 million per week maintained 7 days, likely vaccine centres open. 
Figures UK total likely rise 400,000 - 500,000 per day eventually. feel like I've aged 10 years too. I'm random ass citizen importance lol. can’t stand articles whose headlines say things patients

Then don’t give numbers kind body article really see point. unwilling get vaccinated obviously care much getting infected. spread amongst numbers reduce naturally time. virus infect many people? Quite frustrating people don’t get too. don’t believe change criteria tests. I’m pretty sure start home tests always recorded based sent rather processed. became widely known case. Also one well problem tests sent weren’t always returned, meaning govt relying public meet target (similar set target 100% vaccinations). dodgy bit last day deadline sending far tests dropping 100k following day. 

However, even later testing targets it’s always capacity that’s govt actually provide. people don’t want tests don’t return that’s hands. 

This target reasonable based control, think agree now. try manipulate stats meet agree it’s fair call it, however, don’t think they’ve done anything like yet (for vaccinations least). pedantic, test trace. Track trace Royal Mail product find parcels are. try non-drowsy dm.  let's look objectively, Covid kills agree right? I'm guaranteed contract well likely die. 

The vaccine kill finding out, like covid never get chance adverse reactions it, thats basic math. 

Do ever wonder last 20 years reasearch one effective vaccine type corna virus trials abandoned adverse effects. sudden within 1 year one? ""Ya thanks!""

Big pharma scam! push narcotics kinds crap population many people act like friends, friends even close friend. never know around March started chest pain shortness breath. Sometimes heart palpitations. Fatigue. something like bending would make feel like worked out. Also legs started aching lot. Doctor said costochondritis, take vitamins leg aches figured rest sedentary shape (not overweight though). going months. Blood test fine. EKG fine. Waiting results blood tests results. Chest pain slowly getting better stretching. Still get oir breath nothing sometimes also gotten little better. feel like doctor would laugh told might covid. Bf really sick January/February tests came back negative (wasn't tested covid) thinks may it. think maybe asymptomatic. evidence far suggests UK variant less effected vaccines. simply infectious. 

The SA variant another matter. anecdotes I've seen much employed people... fuck it. Right!? sad. Fwiw, smart greed pays person smart, started someone intelligently selfless.

Stpuid greed pays less overall kicks immediately *Fleeing toward pandemic

FTFY. I’m sorry. took awhile process anger husband got *work* didn’t tell guys without masks get fuck away him. husband careless life...that’s uh...that’s thinker. Don’t sweep rug. Look, 1% cuts line... 1%. We've already vaccinated states. well spread globally first place, see big deal sneak means orders magnitude regular folks get vaccinated. Yeah pretty much mate. That's bad like. 
I can't believe Reddit actually censoring anything proves vaccine safe. 
And people wonder folk like go near it. appease anti-vaxxers all?

If anti-vaxxers ones left without vaccine stop wearing masks obviously!

But probably much sooner. Several studies underway likely point vaccinated people spread virus significant quantity. 

Wearing mask months going kill you, grow already! won't.. keep dreaming Simple math England, whole UK? I've seen Canadians laughing USA's death toll they're going get vaccinated? Pretty classless around. I'm going stay Korea wait turn. It’s strange different diseases affect everyone differently. mono symptom enlarged lymph node. felt bump neck freaked out. went doctor mono. symptoms felt fine. Strange really. I’ve (23) absolutely fine, fit ever, weird works Could someone knowledgeable please help something I'm super worried about. long need exposure becoming contagious?

So I'm exposed Covid one evening, evening stay someone else's house noon, would give person covid? (I'm moving around/socialising, supporting Mum) It’s hate per se, it’s way they’re trained. Symptoms inconsistent day-to-day, patients. conclusive tests. agreed upon treatment. disease poorly defined result hard treat.

How doctor treat something can’t get arms around? think going permanent? I'm sorry, can't imagine going think country world strong Covid response Australia. 

If think we’re bad place look Europe, handful vaccines horizon thanks vaccine share scheme.

The problem people, first lockdown cars out, people traffic, summer hit life goes normal seems, nobody cares distancing families go day trips. that's normal car/minicab. virtual certainty. Taxi drivers caught covid19 UK. Inspite UK taxis glass screens driver passengers. fair, definition patient ""a person receiving registered receive medical treatment"". actually covid patient hospitalized root cause COPD lung cancer example, much verifiable smaller percentage smokers. 22 year old smokes little probably COPD lung cancer. 

""Smoker"" self defined, COPD/lung cancer diagnosed doctor. 

As analogy, drinking lots soda causes diabetes say people drink lots soda high risk, say people diabetes are. Otherwise people may define high risk order get vaccine may capture many low risk people truly high risk. fair onions already kind profile... forever. 

Either find soon chances passing soo low ignored find chances high people need wear masks vaccinated.

Depending country live, summer end year. (next year poor countries) Myles Garrett Browns cautionary tale. guy shell COVID lungs capacity clearly compromised. gov gave police power they’d called authoritarian right-wing gov lefties next year, think know hence hesitation.

The usual hard-line stance Patel usually takes would point harsher measures, think foresee fall-out political damage could done.

Shame make health crisis political. think there's one misrepresentation illness risk death. sure aftereffects covered more.  line ***exists*** special interest group. Lol. Okay dude don’t get upset. voted tories last general election even ardent tories supporter can’t pretend like they’ve done anything totally screw covid response. Haha. Try totally edited comment since realised somewhat stupid suggestion make entire nation hypocrites came back nonsense lol Apparently big money political interests power USA making money pandemic damages caused it.

Owners online retailers making money. Owners large investments making money low interest rates. Apparently high unemployment people getting access education seen opportunity make money cheap labor. applies global warming talk money could made buying Greenland drilling oil artic.

Hopefully new administration change things. may care people, something pandemic enact green new deal. may hire back warned global warming. may hair back [prevent Possible Vaccine effect lowering spread think feeling it’s inevitable ok, it’s actions taken based belief. know many folks feel it’s inevitable thus aren’t changing normal routines bare minimum, like wearing mask without fight, small house parties.

I invited dinner tonight folks. Obviously declined. also puts bind since one happens boyfriend. enough health issues getting sick sooooo something I’d like, things worsen make tough calls protecting myself. Yeah...makes wonder much Trump working Russians China. may well turn around. shit show also. 3,6% Oh good! didn’t realize that. ToRIeS bad! 

If roll-out failure you’d blame government. would guess early February. already vaccinated 25%. 2-3 weeks death rate considerably hopefully also infection rate. Infection rate bit uncertain since phase 3 studies look that, probably decline degree hopefully lot. Can’t wait hear ""COVID Caravans"" coming kill us 🙄  Well, scientific consensus says wrong it’s pretty clear misinformation preventing people right thing!

I think buddies killing people misinformation! live that, something tells unable realize that.  There’s story American hospital gave away vaccines freezer went bad. America. roommates right now! shit! joined Hinge started going dates. Within week infected. home “quarantined” room. got tested, waiting results. negative getting fuck here! countries arn't yet using ""triage"" get desperate. become well aware it, death rate climb 10% instead 1%. Advocating triage needed par suggesting reopening Auschwitz. imagine everywhere looking embrace tourists time right.

I'd also highlight Australia appears real fucked shit aswell, citizens cant get back australia, simply flights avaliable. Worse perhaps, state closes border, people live state (Victoria) can't return home currently, stuck another state processing extremely slow, sure could vaguely legal... let shitload tennis players in.   constantly increasing.  German study showed 70% symptomatic people studied showed typical markers cardiac damage. Seems like serious misinformation problem there.  couple weeks ago. I'm feeling recovered coffee still tastes smells weird popped piece mint chewing gum day strong rotten egg taste. BBC sounds like 70s, makes groups 3 4 time, similar groups 1 2 time. Wut? foreign labor Malaysia coming predominantly?
Is Bangladesh? Myanmar? Somewhere else?

This debt bondage system real scourge. 
I think people going abroad earn money escape poverty right seems many governments make difficult purpose time little human trafficking...

That makes governments complicit. 

It also stops country really developing. incentive climb ladder constant supply cheap labor profit from. Governments really wake realize improving labour protection benefit country hugely long term.  Oh yeah bc random redditors perfectly good sources likely more. Due disease's high rate presymptomatic asymptomatic cases. Ready Hot n fresh...covid combo coke n fries. Norway well. enough users quite useless Emergent Biosolutions less 2000 employees, Moderna less 1000. let employees families get vaccinated early, reward hard must worked develop test vaccines unprecedentedly short time?

All quibbling get vaccine ahead whom, that’s what’s slowing distribution down. things much easier live somewhere isolated culturally/geopolitically irrelevant. read: 1 8 hospital admitted cases. Recovered = formerly hospitalized.

Misleading title.

“The University Leicester Office National Statistics found 47,780 people discharged hospital first wave, 29.4% back hospital within 140 days 12.3% died.” importantly shelf life 6 months regular freezer temperatures. careful pain meds. Look ways safely get time comes. 
In cases vaccine worsen symptoms. Don’t take me, take govt. one? 2024? pre-existing medical conditions before? think confusing doses courses. course two doses. Luka got covid!?? According one friends who's caught covid like worst hangover ever every day 2 weeks.

So might able handle one day it, 2 weeks different. compared non-lockdown would ongoing disaster whole Australia.

An earlier lock Wuhan would saved whole world lot problems. American way involve excessive waste Nothing wrong money motivation. People pay money get things desire, great someone getting paid lot saving lives. cool article. going huge turning point medicine. comparison huge leap forward tech like moon race apt Acceptance vaccine.

If rich pay get it, well got good, right? poor get jab rather avoiding it. Think like massively overpriced branded item rich patronage ensure poor desire for. doctors researches? Einstein, them. bet feel pretty embarrassed huh? necessarily. Maybe rule prevent people selling early vaccinations covering claiming left over, imminently expiring, vaccines. 

Both rule lead negative effects, certainly believe there's world rule place lesser two evils. so? looking comment history? used work golds gym one time member brought hot peppers said take little bite, ate whole thing burned much nose started bleeding little. ate two things yogurt nothing. 

One suave guys would arm workout Friday evening pump clubbing like “nah, that’s nothing let try”, ate whole one like did, went pull ups came back much pain was. 

Toughness equal super human. Talking random doctor/nurse/covid survivor doesn’t make news. 

Every single “news” headline making claims random quotes revolting clickbait doesn’t give truth. It’s embarrassing see anecdotal stuff conflated science covid updates like reminds can't slip careful. could catch probably fine future symptoms issues could pop detrimental. Gotta stay top things.

I'm actually wondering - frankly true vaccine arm ICU nurse respiratory therapist probably worth, like, 10 vaccines arms 26 year old computer programmers live alone work home. 

The ICU nurse crucial part healthcare system trying care active cases; potential superspreader, increased risk severe disease. work home get continue so, groceries delivered, indefinitely. pretty much guarantee catch this, transmission dead end unless need hospital care. ONE sick teacher bigger risk society like 15 sick me's.

There point vaccinating right people risk/spread standpoint actually better vaccinating larger number ""wrong"" people.

I think California gone far line attempt find point, frankly think maximum speed, even completely random, would better. There's GOT way increase HCP care home access also ensuring go much faster this. Well boss idiot What's bothering saying need lockdown 1-2 years, serious lung damage rare. don’t “open up” means protecting citizens letting live normal lives. Gotta remember vaccination become condition entry Australia. It’s already cards. Elex Rodriguez? 400,000 people die problem imo. distinction matter? know, maybe I'm looking hope, starting feel like people finally turning brains again.

You massively upvoted threads like one, constant train long covid hysteria /new , much many people seem convinced, looking comments. massively downvoted, they're growing considerably number. comparison irrelevant title. Basically @vladgrinch said title article pretty useless scientific like you. :b [Persistent fatigue following SARS-CoV-2 infection common independent severity initial infection |

87% 143 infected individuals experienced least one covid19 symptom 30 days. 

44 % reported reduced quality life. think people posting horror stories thread fall within category. 

The percentages seem mind-bogglingly high. admit 60% number India speculation might true. makes feel better admit might lie.

I trust official numbers country either. trusting: leading university made random sample study uncovered 80-90% cases hidden statistics.
Out 10 corona cases, 1-2 identified testing.

The reason tests expensive testing capacity low. someone corona told wait days try get home self-isolate. tests even provided many people.

The consequence official ""worldometer corona case numbers"" heavily undercounted. thing true every European country. also local manufacturing AZ vaccine (via CSL) bulk population, well sufficient supplies Phizer vaccine front line at-risk populations. 

We’re sitting pretty things considered. Yellow fingernails appear heavy smokers (3+ packs per day), even guaranteed side effect. smoked 10 years, even smoking 25 cigarettes day never fingernails change color.

Heck, guilty look back summer relatively lower infection rates think risk tolerance could higher then. course benefit knowing hindsight rates would stay low awhile. took risks, rate stayed low. joint hypermobility? okay everyone cutting line front right? long people getting vaccines. really need people like less conflicts. love appreciate martyrs.

I really get problem is. Moderna seems slow, first 100 million going US. What's US release schedule actually, find anywhere internet. Graph forward data expect 800,000 deaths December -- multiply average expected excessive death rate 1.3 1 million dead quite possible. (Hey, 400,000 dead Jan 17/21 - predictions seem feasible?) 

Vaccines. Mask wearing least indoors. Social distancing. Self-isolation. Vitamin D. Flu shots.

Hot/cold therapies much purpose unless fever hypothermia.

Please give outright dangerous advice know talking about. It’s wild think possibility identified reported. remember conversation mid-January [edit: think around COVID starting appear Germany?] supply chain students university work brought incredible rate replication COVID-19, speculated fast could already spread. kinda dismissed “well that’s Europe Europe far away Oregon...” PM Trudeau Public Health Canada gave ""September 2021"" estimate ""...all Canadians want vaccinated.""

The September 2021 estimate lots qualifiers, easily achievable *if* several vaccine candidates effective, approved able manufactured sufficient quanitities.

[CBC's article goes detail, highlights are:

* Canada ordered enough vaccine 7 different suppliers vaccinate entire population 4 times vaccine spare
* *Everyone* going scrambling vaccine, likely supply chain problems manufacturing problems
* existing Moderna Pfizer/BioNTech orders, Canada meet September 2021 deadline, think increase vaccines, eventually (as orders filled), everyone *could* vaccinated.
* even vaccine candidates proven effective able ramp manufacture, easy Canada hit September 2021 target.

A couple footnotes. Canada criticized vaccines per capita pre-ordered. effectively puts Canada front line vaccines compared countries^1.

Canada's defence pre-orders help vaccines developed faster, everyone benefits; surplus vaccine doses donated; Canada one larger donors COVAX international vaccination program.

It is. Nation already written article first thing smell went test smoke detectors, set come Amazon. im suggesting coworkers inject without even needing appointments go shift, whereas sign ups required phase them. guys act like steps going somehow faster let anybody get it, well, public need make appointment, go location thats hospital, wait line, steps hospital workers injecting other. know open centers still steps.

Wait wait wait. Hold fuck up.

This looks like could *possibly* cause behind IBS. Generally I'll eat certain seemingly innocuous food, later I'll feel like I'm going pass (BP drop), followed horrible cramping diarrhea. I've noticed ""episodes"" I'm also far likely suffer itching related reactions things like soap. I've actually trying work allergy doctor noticed itching, figured likely related allergy thing going on.

As matter fact, started shot therapy started far ""episodes"" like this, dropped dose back down, supported allergy link. top this, I've *far fewer* episodes since started antihistamines. 

I'm going send doctor see thinks really place arguing nature hypothetical time travel. think misunderstanding point article. That's \*way\* confident conclusion based data. 


Sometimes, time even, variant gets lucky. perfectly meaningless variant gets superspreader event, couple child cases superspreads, boom becomes large percentage local cases pure chance. happened many times epidemic happen many times.  


Every variant scrutinized, turn nothing new. Lots countries well last year overrun decent good leadership. 

Pandemic fatigue something don’t think people anticipated whatever reason think last year showed us nz/aus route probably way go. Heavy lockdown early on, close borders, starve virus people get sick distancing. Force work home everyone able, pay non-essential jobs non essential small business cannot wfh curb side. Go hard 6 weeks.

After, track trace aggressively keep certain precautions proceed rolling lockdowns outbreak occurs. Mandatory quarantine entering country even provinces/states.

The faster get with, sooner things open again. try draw half measures longer everything goes for.

Also, relying people “do right things” exercise futility. people will, enough people won’t cancel hard work others . ""weeks""? probably days. presuming Fauci seen preliminary data looks good, certain Moderna/Pfizer delayed pointless red tape FDA's part lack agency efficiency. (I willing cede red tape pointless, significant portion approval speed delay seem totally pointless stuff like scheduling committee meeting everyone knows meeting's result 2 weeks beforehand.)

So sure good, delaying? may heard important issue... never wanted get it, despite knowing would probably take easier route recover since 30yo serious health problems know of. biggest fear infecting family. took precautions super seriously. always wear mask outside. outside long change mask least once. Wash hands every couple hours least 20 seconds (thanks Apple Watch) soap. sanitise hands 90% alcohol like 10-15 times days point really coarse skin back palms. wash disinfect shopping etc. quarantined couldn’t always kept social distancing mind (I literally forgot human touch stranger feels like).
And still got COVID early December. 
As expected didn’t fever even day. week skull splitting headache though. 
18 December doc said longer COVID. 1 month later still stomach problems, get occasional headaches, smell still 80-90% gone, find often forgetting basic things like phone number (which haven’t changed 10 years), name dish order time, last name colleagues etc. Really really frustrating. 
P.s. positive side seems didn’t infect family tests came back negative twice.
I don’t think moral rant. wanted let out... safe everyone. definitely depends person

Although understand say like that. It’s reduce amount anxiety it. turn doesn’t make anything better. It’s actual lives lost. people doesn’t matter actually lost someone it. find sad things occur order understand situation. heart goes lost recovering. proactive measures place. Trump killed them. expect Biden put back.  Wait covid cause cancer? really measure that, though? herd immunity, sufficiently large portion population must longer risk spreading virus, don’t know vaccines accomplish that, even slow rate new infections.

But even vaccines prevented us spreading virus, isn’t fast people getting vaccinated; it’s total portion population that’s immune. rate new vaccinations new infections important, ratio isn’t actually useful anything.

And clear, even doesn’t stop spread virus, everyone absolutely get vaccinated can, save lives prevent massive strain healthcare system. Westbrook looked noticeably came back bubble

**Also, medical professionals scientists preoccupied patients suffer disease, done prevent it, best course treatment, stop rapid spread among public etc... things way priority currently long-term effects disease. friend, ""prefer keeping fear instead""!** Exactly. US, wont hard go like 300k cases per day 150k cases per day. really. Masks prevent spread disease. It’s hospital burden. Vaccinated workers nursing homes, example, still need wear masks unless it’s determined can’t spread illness. vaccine isn’t 100% effective elderly still susceptible infection.

The mask mandates aren’t exclusively tied hospitalization rates. people fail understand. annoying I'm fascinated. Let us pray USA arm clean beautiful data.

One things I'm genuinely worried lasting effects asymptomatic people, especially young people. possible people showing doctors real problems whatever caught immediately either young risk factors. first dose far important. Although stop getting covid, certainly gives much MUCH harder time make sick. 😉 even discussion? federal government helping distribute them, yes. problem all. help result state like California Alabama distributing 50% vaccines thanks help, I'd say get vaccines keep good work. consider giving vaccines state distributing particularly useful. states problems number vaccines, give more? give states whose problems *are* caused many vaccines have, like West Virginia North Dakota? How? Huge investment green energy. Support Hong Kong. Points based immigration system. police recruitment. new taxes (for now). Generous furlough scheme. Lots support small business. world leading vaccination programme.  Let's fucking go!!  shit India, praising India first country past whole sh*tstorm

""More 60% India already corona.""

""How exactly 15K cases day"".

This exactly call praise. attack you, called casual racism. still rertracted accepted ""more 60% India corona"" statement hyperbole, malicious lie.  It'll ended first world countries, much developing world expected get enough doses vaccinate populations year.   contagious covid? Anyone housemate got covid guy don't, even though guys minimal interaction shared space house? ONe thing wonder--let's say J&amp;J 70%---do continue use moderna/big pfizie 65+ use J&amp;J slightly lower risk groups well New England opening window exactly work well, everything gets cold shit needs complex solution. People spread virus? Shocking. quote says would mild. Wow! priorities caring missing seeing sport millions die. would impossible things America safely point time. Even Australian open strict protocols actually put big sporting event safely turning challenge. It’s sad people priorities screwed up. Technically lived country priorities actually reduce spread virus first place could attending sporting events without risks pandemic without need vaccines. Sounds like bargain me. Count pay $5 share research costs. Uh no? tons gatherings huge families. Okay, yep, skimmed it, saw enough. Downvoting OP. Thanks information!  States need support distributing vaccines, punishments. federal government giving resources workers money help vaccine rollout, taking away vaccines like kids punishment.

That’s foolish lagging states don’t ability improve without help.

Edit add; states aren’t willfully withholding vaccine. West Virginia well ignored federal plans large pharmacies used local businesses. federal government going tell states do, supply resources. *But death rate only....*

Fuck you. fucked either way reasons may well long required vaccinations take effect etc Yeah sure, ok, whatever. Honestly, I'll believe see it. Approaching herd immunity every means! March, capacity that. I'm saying, we're vaccinating 1M doses day March, seriously pathetic. We're already almost amount even pressed gas GOOD shortages they've always been... Ouch, going rabbit hole real quick giving wiki link read. read article! Thanks tip! know flu too, though? pretty sure Florida took “if you’re 65 come down” approach.

They did, hasn’t proven kind advantage getting vaccine quicker. two days ago, [Florida middle pack terms percentage population many parts world started vaccination, would infection numbers look summer heat returning? plausible say numbers go signifcantly like 30-50%? People never realised this. Weak lockdown lifted early = need lockdowns future. 636,000 COVID vaccines administered yesterday today. number may seem light, actually good weekend update.

The 7 day rolling average increased 898,000 doses administered per day. Soon we'll hitting million. Maybe within people saying Covid won’t defeated 2021? We’ll 4 different pharmaceutical corporations churning many vaccines quickly can, it’s possible vaccinate enough people end virus next year?  masks around reduce community transmission leads overwhelmed hospitals due large numbers people infected. large number people get vaccinated, can't get infected, hospital burden would reduced point irrelevancy since people getting sick anymore, would mean masks longer necessary since hospital burden can't caused population that's immune. 636k today update, California another day 100k, 115k. really doesn’t matter, lockdown expensive almost anything reduces need save money. University experience taken away going extremely distressful matter Even order magnitude, fuck that. Guess I'm staying home year. boss fucking gung ho working office. We're texas, one highest rates infection country. Misinformation association promoted range of scientifically discredited hypotheses, including the belief HIV cause AIDS, gay reduces life expectancy, a link abortion breast cancer, a causal relationship vaccines autism Right, building national broadband would part massive infrastructure push competent administration would done. 

But HR payroll people don’t need building everyday, plenty don’t need come almost ever. Uhhh per capita Ontario nowhere near top. Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan Quebec share pretty small apartment roomie got covid months ago never got far tell, even got tested couple times recommended time frame came back negative. 

Totally anecdotal experience make seems even less likely someone could catch like passing someone street We're going pass WWII deaths Donald J Trump leaves office. another cap feather! way holds Trump thing ever going loser lackeys criminals play sandbox indicted bathtub full crimes publicly stripped power money either put prison let back street like rats Exactly, person mentioned it’s people every time. seasonality probably effect, yeah, also people things outdoors reduces spread due lower transmission rate setting women 90.5 men 89.26, pretty darn close common explanations revolve around average age, population density, average number people per dwelling/family, cultural factors.

It's surprising whole area bit research would also indicate mediocre testing would play role well.

Ah. We'll wait excess death reporting shake out, then. Economist reported discrepancy reporting countries, all. unemployment rates high right now, lot people work looking jobs kinds fields, including medical/nursing. think near future least, shortage people looking jobs.   5G air, microchips upload DNA 5G, duh. I’m one them. usually don’t get year Yes really. us averages around 200,000-250,000 cases daily, current vaccination rates us around 800,000- 1 million daily vaccinations. Canada 1/10 population US, too!

Anyone else want chime fucking useless population facts? That’s bad capacity scale fast. Gets population done beginning March, probably everyone willing take it. 

Question you’ll sent enough vaccine.

I’m rural county. We’ve getting 1,000 doses week. Given two dose regime that’s little year get everyone. type little better 140 words per minute certainly take one word jab piece shit like Donald Trump I'm looking like 280  rescue rangers.... sister law got it, husband didn’t, didn’t even though spent around hour car day symptoms started. pretty mild case (tiny bit cough shortness breath, loss taste smell), I’m sure anything it. USA 0 restrictions. thing that's closed California gyms can't eat restaurants. even limit stores capacity. totally insane. Brexit nothing vaccine roll out. nice try Everything. wear mask rest life feel high mighty saving lives feel like it. Many people mentioning end, review done end feb half term decide whether schools go back. We’re probably close herd dog dont really know would enforced US though. last days has, we'll wait bit longer know sure (considering sabbath such) Hairdresser? Wasn’t big early 150 women went hairdresser one caught wore masks?  Good argument. level brain power perfect following whatever people tell important unimportant.  Except testing hasn’t dropped since vaccine roll Age tiering good compromise. there’s already shortage workers industry they’d shooting foot.

Speaking anecdotal experience, many many friends acquaintances work one industries decimated Covid, lot looking move different job fields. So, think something like medical/nursing field problem finding new job seekers near future. You’re still vaccinated first dose

It less efficacy Yep, instant €100 fine good reason 5km home. Hundreds people fined yesterday trying go walk don’t use half doses

People still get second dose

Also sticking first dose 12 weeks doesn’t impact vaccination rate. US 950k vaccines per day, 7 day new case average 228k. we're right track UK 4x number vaccines given per day new cases. I'm glad small town ball. medical centre small town sending patients another medical centre 10 miles away tiny village public transport, return taxi 70 quid. 
I idea why, closer accessible vaccination centres. 
Some people generously running shuttle service initiative. Plus, can't even keep up... vaccines waiting used. problem lot people currently hospitalized significant portion unfortunately die coming days/weeks. Congratulations you! That’s huge accomplishment. quit biting fingernails. Baby steps. There's really anything Biden short term make vaccinations go faster. People expecting much him. Things continue ramp incrementally like Trump administration. J&amp;J Astrazeneca report good results could big help, equally possible report mediocre results help all.

It's absolutely helpful way people trying politicize vaccine. makes seem less trustworthy strengthens antivaxxers position.  Yawn It’s actually pretty easy change course vaccine. keep vaccinating Shutdowns drastic things like sure. hope still see mask mandates certain high risk situations. hard wear mask?  It'll get scumbag stench air. common explanations revolve around average age, population density, average number people per dwelling/family, cultural factors.

a bit research would also indicate mediocre testing would play role well.  Ok, I'll bit accurate, mean cells. injecting mRNA, synthetic RNA body. I've read, designed computer. I'm assuming 3d printer... ;)

Can tell synthetic RNA made? tell Genetic Engineering?

It organic origin... engineered, manufactured, modified. Would disagree assessment? Ok, see issue.

I phrased it: wish country already 60% corona, would mean pandemic over. 20% infection rate November, probably 25-30% now.. still 60% would help slow virus. still second wave curfews mask mandates shops closed. Long way wished 60%.

The 15K new cases per day India translate 10.71 cases/million pop, country 1900 cases yesterday, 190 cases/million population yes, sh.t, India quite well. hypothetical $44k worth carpet cleaning $30k curtain cleaning, wow white house must lot carpets curtains... justifies it? wasn’t even expecting approved US great. think public sector function like NHS, controlled Department Health ""nothing government""?!!!!!

Their entire policy crisis controlled directed govt. Including financing vaccines. pace continues take 1000 years vaccinate everyone Brazil   Janssen part Johnson Johnson owned U.S. since 1963. Janssen website literally says “headquartered New Jersey”.

It’s American company international subsidiaries. Stop fear mongering. Great open pubs somebody tell Alberta get shit together would like stabbed well know handful people second doses postponed booked entire second jab system falling wayside?

Gotcha, you’re nutter Also, emergency services would stop. ambulance heart attack victims. firemen kitchen catches fire. cops handle situation crazy neighbor decides get high come steal patio furniture. plumber call septic backs up. one fix power line there’s high winds blows down. could go . . Great hear first, sorry hear second. mother passed recently (username related) - covid. sure easy suffer loss without much visit. were, luck due local circumstances, able mother without major disruption covid protocols. close though - week earlier ICU staff would thier hands tied visits. hard say anything circumstances good, timing least great blessing.

Nobody knows prevalent serious is. studies estimate incidence hospitalized cases, that's pretty small fraction cases begin with. that, anecdotes. Totally agree. busted me, totally forgot :/ Heard Cody Garbrant? UFC MMA fighter, covid apparently still struggling post covid effects. Track trace always going fail 1000s cases, many contacts properly need isolate contacts contacts. Really doable sub 100 cases. Ain’t America. ""Spread mass"" different zero cases. seems really odd me. local hospital also reported 0 influenza cases, sent conspiracists tizzy hard time disagreeing them. **Drastically** reduced, sure. *zero*? Florida given one million vaccinations far. Thanks feedback. also worry even though may vaccinated, feel moral obligation us spread there, proven vaccinated, can't spread it. good information though provided. wish luck there! Thanks this. downvoted another post people delirious don’t read. I’m hoping new vaccines running soon needed 🤞🏻  good parent love optimism ikr. We're 10+ months (or even year, depending count). Surely government officials aware long term damage illness causes. convenient ignore it. like aerosol transmission. numbers California absolutely terrifying. many friends I'm terrified safety. California really seem well vaccine distribution. China built entire hospitals dedicated treating COVID last year. America threw everyone nursing homes.  also provided financial backstop start producing supply approval. That's huge.

Operation warp speed one ideas administration promoted good idea  &amp; CA competing win worst state vaccinating never convinced otherwise Lucky you! I’ve scarred life toes. 

I’ll definitely keep touch. like too. tend change accounts every months, it’s hard forget “ilovedogsandglitter.” doesn’t?! 

Thanks great chat. It’s lonely 10 months! Wapo needs retract this. Im sure journalist mistake journalist covers political beat, medical/science beat probably got news politician reading circulating DNC talking point newsletter repeated like came real source. Editor nixed now.

It clear following closely ModeRNA Pfizer holding 2nd doses time, Azar release soon. physical federal inventory location. Wapo article misleading bogus. 50x times covid death. That's necessarily best reason continue normalizing it. true. states' fault. can't make observation here. 

Though point severe side effects vaccine due pre-existing health conditions. mRNA vaccines likely advance field epidemiology immunology decades way World War 2 advanced nuclear engineering, aerospace engineering, cryptography decades. Sadly humans hard time motivated approach potential without fire ass, fire asses, God damn, things get done, quickly. I'm sorry going this. Covid horrible disease. I'm glad getting better. Hopefully healthy soon. Sorry, allowed. Post removed. heard anything AZ/Oxford Fauci putting sentence J&amp;J saying expected FDA submission within weeks both..... people worst. I’m planning getting already hit one million doses couple days. 

100 million people much better goal still achievable focus. fair 'Almighty Dollar' important almost every country world health. didn’t “get” movie kid think regularly reason. People don’t value mental health pisses off. get pcr tested today negative, negative? exposed 7 days ago orders 2021, exact time frame yet deliveries.

The EU seems painfully slow vaccinations far. feel like states one point others dropping ball. can't tell yet vaccine distribution shit show worst outcomes been. J&amp;J Oxford vaccines get approved it’s doable. easier distribute current ones J&amp;J one one dose. two like others. Somehow West Virginia 100 percent even Florida well 50 percent (of long term care residents). shameful. Cool! Cant Tokyo get 2024 Olympics? earliest one hasnt taken yet? Yup. I’m amateur bodybuilder...a docs told bodybuilders done well covid. said that, also know examples bounced back well. understand point it’s valid. people spread virus higher protected thus mitigating spread others. someone immunosuppressant heart damage mild moderate covid infection could result bad outcome. I’d love see statistical models. Ideally hopefully protect effectively. God. biggest fear, damage slowly. U.S. big trouble ~~if case~~.

FTFY requirement that’s medically sound unprovable.

It's clear medically sound. seen good evidence smoking large risk factor own. I'll wait Johnson Johnson. maybe Oxford I'd prefer Johnson Johnson.

It's normal made country regulate (I trust China Russia). muh low death rate Unfortunately 100M doses 100M people.

It say doses. says vaccinations.

Also, new vaccine single dose. J&amp;J &amp; Oxford getting approval 2+ months earlier going looked huge blunder. would saved many lives. Manufacturers (some?) said distribute things equitable way also soon would order it. case, got worse deal normal since bough less doses whole EU. 2 trillion gave corporations already gone. nonsense us afford anything got us debt first place. /s they're planning get Americans inoculated Spring 2021 achieve herd immunity summer therefore see return pre-pandemic normal lifestyles Autumn 2021. They're aiming reach herd immunity threshold midsummer new school year starts September they're hoping get back pre-corona lifestyles fall. Feels like they're stuck April 2020. Ding reported it; he's notorious hyperbole inaccuracy, especially trying claim figure 70-80% based news article accompanying study. got worked fecal-oral viral spread tried advocate N95 underpants.

Simple. 2022 becomes Summer Olympics year Tokyo. Malls closed bit, that's true. think they're open now. Exactly, likely similar another wave summer, probably bad long get vaccinated. Efficacy may great production numbers may low several months. must read comments then. agree people don’t want to.

It childish, selfish, petty first world complaint I’ve ever heard of.
 suggests culture completely incapable slightest physical discomfort.

Probably we’re damn obese. Lmao one dumbest comments I’ve ever read Reddit. can’t help feel revelation need two shots fucked vaccine distribution hard.

Basically, supply vaccines halved didn’t realize ready roll never updated orders. Autumn 2021, GB reach herd immunity. Good them. Hmm, published Oxford/Astrazeneca study trials also Brazilian population? people believe angels use Konami code make butter chicken seismic lubrication atonal heterodyne. anything anything. data China. believe anything coming China, lost cause.

I wonder numbers Democrats hardly ever control. weird, isn’t it?

I wonder could you’re misperceiving situation? We're much different rest country. Baker? lot distribution related federal efforts. Highly unrealistic expectations others really, really big. Wikipedia White House includes six stories 55,000 ft^2 (5,100 m^2) floor space, 132 rooms 35 bathrooms, 412 doors, 147 windows, twenty-eight fireplaces, eight staircases, three elevators, five full-time chefs, tennis court, (single-lane) bowling alley, movie theater (officially called White House Family Theater[79]), jogging track, swimming pool, putting green.[34] receives 30,000 visitors week.

So yeah, seems like could legitimately rack five-figure cleaning bills place. quite plausible UK decided pay premium compared countries expectation/hope prioritized supply limited production. America vaccinating people per capita countries world, stop hating USA much. nuts? good thing they're fumigating whole building. Stares U.S. oh really? better are. course, think everyone point.

Okay? would better environment dead that’s going happen looks like that’s they’re applying EUA? (Which would nuts) maybe could get press release earlier week?

However, includes alert top points press release Updated: August 27, currently updating Ivermectin section Guidelines. Pending release updates, please see COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel’s Statement Use Ivermectin Treatment situation dire even non-primary paths transmission closed.

It always dire. We're waking reality now.

Also inaccurate counter argument dire... guess what, got point let schools stay open. I've read people muscle actually struggle illness people appropriate amount fat. People 'peak' shape dont enough fat stores fall back times crisis also said 20 million end December also going happen. Stop promising moon honest humble instead arrogant. liked it. Big, open spaces. Gorgeous sky. lived western end get buttes badlands. Felt like living wild west movie. overpromise underperform, it’s really good either. 

Remember Trump’s promise 20 million end December? didn’t even hit 4. Set whatever Internal goals like campaign, set high, proactive minimizing roadblocks incentivize speed, set fires state officials asses vaccine progress terribly minimal, administration risk breaking Public lifesaving delivery promise 320 million people.

Better promise perform reverse. scale 1-100 'how surprised meter', mine pegged -2. will. 

Is country falling apart diptheria chorlera? No, thanks vaccines. 

I think people saying need get many people vaccinated still cautious short time really takes affect. 

People stubborn written dramatically one read listen. smokers, whole list ""pre-existing conditions"", none require proof. Either way there's questions asked even make something up. People work nursing homes paid garbage back breaking, soul crushing work pre-pandemic. Facilities cant mandate vaccination lose staff one going fill jobs. can't pay people $7.25 hour sick leave benefits require vaxxed - staff walk. positions already understaffed long pandemic.  lot places expanded first stage include eveyone 65 and, again, *far* elderly want vaccine easily access right now. vaccine that's bought someone money, means elderly at-risk individual delayed getting it. 

Most people know scrambling right schedule parents/ grandparents vaccines (and really difficult time). don't. question many orders magnitude off.

And China's defense may testing ability back get everyone. think England, Wales, using military deliver vaccine. know USA this.

Whiteboard Doctor 55 videos ivermectin - coverage NIH Changes Recommendation Ivermectin Treat COVID-19: Breaking News!
Jan 14, 2021
Whiteboard Doctor NIH today (January 14th) officially changed recommendation use Ivermectin treat COVID-19. Previously, recommended use. Today, changed recommendation referencing increased numbers clinical trials done positive results since last update August 27th. recommend neither use Ivermectin COVID-19. mean? Check video details Ivermectin, new NIH recommendations, may mean patients healthcare providers going forward! fair, rate US actually [very relative daily new cases counts. Someone real data. Thanks clarification. Wait what? New vaccines? thought one.

Now 2, 3. one get? inevitable lot people going get radicalized experienced horror COVID-19 many people hell bent damned determined spread disease around. Agreed. Something critical time start punishing people. efforts made help states struggling push vaccine faster. Canada won’t doses 40 million people end year despite paying enough vaccines immunize everyone three times over.  Actually depends furnace using....ours take average 90 mins per cycle. Depending course weight. one gonna mention going vaccination producers advice providing two doses three weeks apart instead aiming administering second dose 12 weeks, fact past days said might even make that?

This isn’t really good news imho, people aren’t really fully vaccinated evidence endlessly kick second date road still immune covid 19 Actually they're intentionally participating germ warfare see undesirable. That's they're this. valid point. easy people find job pays near minimum wage. can't ever see grocery stores mandating vaccine employees. do, employees want quit go work across street. CTO fortune 500 company, can't walk similar gig. bottom jobs ladder, job openings wide open. tumbling this? late stop spread evictions hungry people, get little trophy anyway. Good job! Based comments Fauci, US gonna need following UK lead get AstraZeneca approved within 30 days

In current area, 70+ year old people able get vaccine already 2 month wait appointments. got mom appointment soon registration went live. next door neighbor 18 hours later. appointment middle March. 

I hoping type backlog gets resolved fast.  I’m really hoping tweaking effective new variants otherwise, may good enough.  Right - fully vaccinated. makes article misleading. I’m getting tested tomorrow free clinic. asked insurance, I’ve heard several stories insurance companies charging people Covid tests suppose free. I’ve lot issues insurance before, getting charged $900 physical check things well. play safe tell actually don’t insurance taken moms insurance year? Given horrible insurance provider is, good feeling they’re going charge free covid test. 650k US reach herd immunity even without vaccinations lockdowns based data Dakotas. end 550000 think.

All horde people screaming ""it harm young! want freedumb!!!"" post comment removed suitable r/coronavirus. 

Please know alone frustration many people feel same. I'm glad venting want thank using space vent unfortunately, remove comment due fact best-suited sub type discussion.

I suggest checking out: popular sub might helfpul is: /r/SuicideWatch property owners residents. several compounding problems: 

* vaccine approvals
* dosage manufacturing, order sizes, distribution
* vaccine administration: dosage scheduling time immunity 
* people refusing get it
* approval &lt; 16 yo

We need liken75%+ immunity one way another safely open things back up, preferably higher. even unofficial immunity higher official, can't count that.

So US, currently approved vaccines ordered doses, vaccinated 200M/~350M. that's 100% usage 100% compliance.

So chance summer might back normal US, that's everything goes smoothly. Recent history would point optimistic. longer let time table be, likely hit it.

The whole world take much longer since 7.5B+ needing vaccine anywhere 7.5B 15B doses. Amd hope variant evades vaccine pop time. individual counties start return normal free travel ways off. Yeah that's irrational. complaining struck lightning. Yeah story really concerning (especially I'm also get new puppy worried handoff)! sounds like took precautions within power.

How bad case been?

Hoping precautions took least mean minimal viral load therefore hopefully milder case... Interesting! Thank you! I’m 41. heart attack 39 risk factors. odds haven’t really side. want 95%.  understanding UK Israel leading world, immunising people rate. UK much bigger country. part top 1% got vaccines? I’m worried now. state Monday afaik Uh. One comprehensive articles I’ve seen badly botched this. sobering read. I’m 26, prior health history. Got Tested positive Covid thanksgiving day. Kind like mild flu time. 

Now, 2 months later I’m getting hit chest pains, headaches head pressure like wouldn’t believe, vertigo dizzy spells, anxiety attacks debilitating feel like quit teaching job insurance. 

My symptoms switch almost daily. It’s scary knowing I’m going hit next. Today it’s itchy scalp feels like top head fire.  would inevitable course years vaccine. got vaccine man! We're cutting pandemic right half move lives. want part lucky ones get infected. Exactly, telling body react virus (Since virus kill anyone, body's reaction virus. People seem unaware fact). It’s unfortunate probably true.  avoid. need study, prepare, something it. trying half ""avoid"" whole time that's failed here. Great news! day longer wear masks upon us.  isn’t reason. He’s accusing random Chinese-Canadian street. She’s public official, presumably feels actions rhetoric speak greater loyalty China Canada. conflicts preoccupation U.S. ""silver bullet"" solutions. every problem, frank, pandemic. there's many cases US dont even let people go hospital check, many medical people public assume recovered. Yes . Upwards 50% them. I’m you. honestly don’t care. money would pay get vaccinated today too. Nope, 3.8m first jabs alone. Well 4m include boosters. School requirement social development. Disappointing article. even mention governors enforcing mask mandate, party would overturn legalisation governors could ask politely enforce mask mandate.   also let know put much sugar salt, hazardous health,

so could develop basically preventable diseases like obesity. wearing masks highly related small dicks very, gay people closet. Yes, read article finding inflammation discussed previously. calling “damage” permanent unless exacerbate create scarring. Otherwise goes away rest treatment. Google “myocarditis.” agree. Post exposure vaccination like race vaccine virus, virus long incubation period, vaccine probably win. Like rabies tetanus. already symptom onset, vaccine help you. Use bootstraps, buy book, millionaire time. Seminar coming soon area! literally said this, provided links got downvoted lol.

I think complete easy digest facts virus, well in-depth information need widely available everyone page. People idea they'll handle virus may benefit abundance caution. People dying unexpectedly infected weeks/months later *after recovering*. Definitely something consider... didn’t exactly take genius see coming. Better yet, refrigerated truck park stadium vaccinate 50,000 people day. every major city. biggest fear, damage slowly.

Exactly. Kind like [Scarlet Fever large old population.  25 year old smokes occasion

I smoked half year way made feel terrible. Quit usually I’m bar, month even less since pandemic, still. cig every isn’t gonna hurt anyone that’s young healthy. That'd make sense get everything finalized database lock. locked, things move pretty fast. days run results, clinical team pour data. I'm wondering feeling confident well understanding vaccines targeting spike. OK, what’s plan evolve humans beyond greed? Smell finger able there's almost 2 weeks local /community transmission. Many pandemic issues financially related. Many people work, can't afford healthcare, waiting evicted moratoriums end, watching small businesses go bankrupt. could use money professional athletes wealthy individuals provide stimulus checks better healthcare need, I'd consider huge societal benefit. going hardest stretch we're close escape feel staring rising vaccination numbers waiting first plummet cases happen signal final dash Better carp ceiling tiles. Exactly, die would suffer potentially lifetime issues. We're basically crippling big chunk work force putting huge mental physical burden sick doctors nurses . test catch it? show blood work? bein smartass “possibly vaccines may needed gainst emerging variants” nowhere near saying current vaccine structure going work variant presented paper. believe you’ve misinterpreted.  expression is, even blind squirrel right twice day Exactly. Demonizing ppl getting vaccinated ridiculous point. virus poorly dealt anyone power someone able get vaccinated may necessarily number one group, jump line get it. it. one knows anything except fact get vaccine. it. It’s still vaccinated person. happening factory developing countries (and developed ones). main issue practice debt bondage, recruiting agencies foreign workers' home countries (really poor ones) trick huge loans ""privilege"" going work not-so-poor country.

There really incriminating evidence horrible abuses factories themselves. People working rather closely together? bet that's happening factories world. Queuing go Covid tests? That's good thing. video one guy welding without wearing goggles? Maybe issued goggles refused wear them.

I'm sure horrible accommodations provided factory. whether separate lodgings exist practice debt bondage creates market cheapest possible housing migrant workers.

It's difficult problem solve one company refuses hire cheap foreign workers going survive. think Canadian hospitals going purchase gloves triple usual price Malaysian glove factory promises hire local Malaysians. They'll stop buying Top Glove switch competitor thing, quietly. Summer 2021 thing! (Ive isolating since march) light end tunnel  geeze, made clear people even equipment contaminate fish (i mentioned fish coz talking sushi) virus. maybe living fish water can't get infected (no one studied actually), fish water getting prepped, get contaminated prepper/tools used contaminated. washing may wash away virus end sushi master tools, course wear gloves etc someone infected without realizing it, virus particles may still escape mask somehow contaminate food, like boxed icecream/frozen salmon found contaminated.

but i'm done discussing food transmission since everyone 100% convinced safe ingest corona virus. would say asymptomatic usually mean there's lung damage... mirror us actually want read article? What? mild case 5 weeks ago real fear mine. Didn’t really feel sick. congestion. Smell/taste loss call 100 days remember check this, see it. Production distribution really tricky.

I’m giving readable sources see ten second google search, it’s knowledge already *living this* speaking regularly doctors researchers almost year. studies plentiful. craft unpaid reports random Redditor.

For everyone else: I’m saying accurate easily verifiable. trend evident take big picture widely reported. studies Europe Asia put percentage post-acute patients like 80% - depends study they’re looking at. look month, look three months, look six months. ask lingering symptoms, ask debilitating symptoms.

Fortunately, seems early victims still getting pregnant bearing children normal. 

Could imagine impacts society COVID impacted fertility pregnancy viability rates like 10%? Jack Ripper even stab fast population small city state? Agree- 100 million doses 100 days (by approx. April 15th) really continuation current rate vaccination (maybe 10% increase speed) well expected supply curve. 2 million/day 200 million 100 days would much better target would roughly align expected deliveries.  assure long-haulers slipped cracks. injected 30-40k ppl one test group severe disease. 

Lots long haulers never severe disease. That's one scary things long haul. Nobody knows prevalent going be, start showing up. Pfizer study even check whether vaccine prevented infection, rather preventing illness. However, recent data Israeli vaccination program shows seem prevent infection considerable degree.

Anyway, yeah plan get vaccinated soon can. joke even vaccination protect getting covid, least 5g chips vaccine make mobile data faster. Heh. it, confirm get shortness breath months later. I'm sorry. Yea,virus takes break holidays Sundays. North Carolina least, park mobile vaccination clinic every Food Lion state full week. I've never seen podunk town FL. Well, that's bit confusion there.

Agreed, adds argument wealthy people able pay one. Poor people need money, wealthy people trying offer exchange vaccines. system could use money stimulus checks, increasing supply, providing healthcare need it. Arguably helped anybody Europe, though. US miles better France Germany. Maybe great examples (isn't Germany's healthcare system federally funded insurance, run state? Dunno France).

I think nationalised healthcare (or spite it), rather good vaccine procurement policy. But...but....we have... seriously??? health fitness studies read?

""Aliens."" believe government figures promises everything tickity boo.
Gotcha, lost it. right, total faith modern medicine. However, government messed handling COVID every step way, they've run vaccine. stay house almost 24/7 severe asthma, get COVID Id probably get sick die. I'm hearing getting vaccine time, I'll wait two three months extra. seems like never going end. socializing done text telephone I'm going crazy. We're meant live alone like this.

Western culture focuses freedoms individual eastern cultures collectivists. put group individual.

They right group, dictator evil government ready bonk them. Link working  Fully agree. needs “line sand” date restrictions end regardless percentage people elected get vaccine. date would essentially vulnerable populations vaccinated, deaths hospitalizations plunged, walk Walgreens CVS stores literally every corner say “I would like vaccine”. date, choose vaccinated, Godspeed fellow citizen...you’re own! situation would go extra effort taping mask face thus preventing moist air reaching glasses. ask partner wanted many kids? always thought one kid per adult family way much work, need much time, also far expensive levels income.

I’ll fight everything power dodge bullet. must onion news. feel like messaging push get minorities trust vaccine going wrong direction. meant use abuse minority ethnic groups, well white people clamoring it? hurting well white people. best tool we've made far combating virus. Hope so! Go New Jersey! Blah blah blah Trump bad. 

I'm sure even C19 cleaned White House president leaves. thorough C19. Biden also quite old fracture ankle playing dog. Soooo extra cautious.

Looking back it, doctor sure Covid since “wasn’t yet” said bad cold (flu test negative).

Luckily he’s young healthy, also medical professional working compromised patients whole time.

I’m glad know now, US GOT step up. Precisely. Got it. Yeah whole thing last year everything including scope peehole found nothing bladder. blood work came back fine year. also colonoscopy year found tiny polyp tripped 27 polyp benign. time colonoscopy 26 dad died colon cancer 50. Yes, make good point. 

Amazing people basic understanding biology say things make sense disprove bullshit. wild. fair, quite advantage guys, able comprehend simple concepts. starters, highest percentage people vaccinated almost 9% eligible vaccinated. people really ask sort thing? land border closed beyond essential travel, I've heard easily bypassed well. actual border far closed. Look international flights. symbolism Trump border closed worth it...but actually effective. done proper job. nothing testing. affected pandemic huge number cases hospitals running ICU beds.

There seems class people ignoring health measurses spreading diseases higher rate there. Really? That's great! explain treatment? There's much worry false negative case PCR, yes rapid kits. silly whole thing. Stay safe well.

Yes silly weighing risks taking proper precautions avoid unnecessary infection.    totally depends incubation viral load. negative still able spread virus without symptoms. (mostly day two test positive) paper details prescribing medication frail frail experience higher incidence severity adverse drug events medicine use potential changes pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics. Prescribing patients requires constant vigilance review, considering impact every medicine, well overall drug load, comorbidities, function goals People frail likely experience adverse drug events patterns drug use and, potentially, changes pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics. Also susceptible effects adverse drug reactions reduced resilience. Patients higher frailty index score twice likely least one potentially inappropriate medicine prescribed. also likely experience adverse drug reaction compared frailty threshold. Wait, federal government biggest stopping issue another part pandemic response? Yes, multiple things changed pre COVID blood test. lead additional panels follow second opinion urology visit. Probably 2 weeks findings EUA. Considering traditional vaccine moderna pfizer, maybe sooner Same. month us recovered. I’m masks (in certain public places) life train, ends helping post-pandemic. Anything particular right vaccine distribution?  Fingers crossed. heard usual amount time reinfection? read article study stated someone acquired immunity 'protected' 5-6 months, maybe longer. showed symptoms. employer testing everyone work week now.

You still answered question though. weightlifters potential larger long-term impacts athletes? Especially claim there's cardio involved. Agreed. caught flu August 2019, September (with strep time!), strep early 2020

Okay. Sure. think skull could problem? dunno cheeks bit depressed might source problem. try learn now, late.😂 abnormally high number people experienced anaphylactic shock, severe allergic reaction requires immediate medical attention, receiving shot Moderna vaccine one San Diego vaccination site, Dr. Erica Pan said statement Sunday night. number fewer 10, cluster negative reactions prompted California Department Public Health pause administration 330,000 doses batch, distributed throughout state, investigation complete. actually convinced concerningly high percentage parents actually like kids expected to. People like talk ferocious, unparellleled love offspring anything protect them. see parents walking newborns around grocery stores, seeing unmasked kids grouping softball soccer teams park. see bitching schools needing open. 

So much wanting anything protect kids give best chances succeeding. Parents sent fucking pandemic like lambs slaughter old people dying first? There’s good case made “age mixing” actually better kids, anyway. railroad arbitrary “grade” groupings, convenient _us_, makes education easier compartmentalize, there’s nothing developing human brain makes optimal: say trapped home parents year good thing, either, course.

But basic idea kids “missing out” perpetually surrounded age-similar peers holds little water. 

Google “zone proximal development” even fascinating insights obsessions grades peer groups kind bonkers contrary learning actually works. Children benefit able “context switch” whim, naturally find right degree challenge, depending subject area. Grades forced peer grouping rob that.  Wow, real? Wow. New Jersey stupid giving smokers vaccine serious medical conditions.  maybe initial shot 2 boosters? vaccine- intramuscular nasal- [doesn’t prevent catching spreading prevents developing severe disease (assuming robust immune response). Ohio less 3,800 people currently hospital covid, lowest number 2 months. pushing close 6,000 peak weeks ago. dropping numbers cases, holidays over, there's reason think keep going down. Thankless job either way imo. true. long haulers normal labs imaging. True, pointing people downplay COVID ""just flu cold"" worse colds flus normally pretty predictable. I’m two months Covid isolation still can’t really smell. Maybe 20% back, seems change day day. It’s weird. really hope I’ll able smell lilacs spring. Like flying standby! Florida badly. im sure ""looking at"" Florida.  said peer reviewed? peer reviewed studies showing ridiculous claim we're counting car accidents covid deaths? think they're concerned particular batch integrity vaccine safety. variant thing absolutely hype. variants don’t anything immunity evasion, never will, that’s thing matters right now

No one said anything immunity invasion.

The problem variants *exponential growth*. Exponential growth cases = exponential growth death suffering.

It unlikely United States vaccinate fast enough [outpace exponential growth frustrates end. family history heart problems yet taking COVID seriously. aunt got July still cannot exercise strenuous activities. experiences heart palpitations almost daily doctor said extremely high risk cardiovascular problems line. aunt became visibly angry told son taking online classes...

This serious, deadly, line well. Keep family safe. unvaccinated ppl wore masks theyd safe real risk dont wear masks wish public health bureaucrats would appreciate ""extreme abundance caution"" inappropriate wartime conditions in, lead many deaths. never going 100% able point one thing says vaccine. estimating based timing reaction vaccine, studied side effects younger, healthier patients. leaning towards 'probably' this, that's good enough evidence, may well call question thousands COVID deaths well. troll. hope that's case. Antibody passports gives incitament catch virus able visit countries.

Vaccine passports without problems either since could create black market introduced vaccines available everyone. got voted hell saying kids go stores, go public all. long hauler issues, 6 months, still can't work. idea long term health effects. want children sick. understand everyone luxury, we're fortunate. I'd anything keep kids getting this. we’ve exposing kids anti-vaxxers many years. kids shots, they’re far greater risk 2% kids measles vaccine isn’t effective, compared one 0.02% kids COVID causes serious health issues.

In words, real threat kids anti-vaxxers refusing MMR polio vaccines along (and still sent school/daycare anyway). anti-vaxxers’ choice refuse COVID vaccine much lower threat wife vaccinated. Agreed. Kind like bringing herpes meth orgy. Yeah, shame you, definitely one everyone involved understands this. Because, unlike you, medical staff psychopaths. listerine? Maybe could rinse that, brush toothbrush without toothpaste, rinse one time something?

I'm sure much worse that'd toothpaste it'd kill bad breath still get plaque brushing. maybe toothpaste alternative. Yeah, makes harder. sympathize parents kids tough time many reasons hating online learning closed schools daycares. side-eye two parents described plenty time help single kid choose to. 

My aunt kindergarten teacher, trying keep kids making progress need develop online school nightmare, especially since aren’t used school self direction really tasks executive functions age. she’s lucky, there’s income housing internet computer access issues families.

May ask partner wanted many kids? always thought one kid per adult family way much work, need much time, also far expensive levels income. Looking one young kid eats time adult. don’t remember anyone saying representative entire country. fact, specifically mentioned sample bias inherent study. key breath cannot come top wired part mask, come thru mask like meant to, thus try press wired part snugly really sticks nose bridge, wear glasses hold even afraid getting it, position anyone walk you, wear N95 mask covered? Sorry, never went much never thought might one problem . Necessity mother invention all, dont till now. Lol, saw someone say would keep kid school child got vaccine. like probably wont 2022 child even chance getting vaccine. course guy never gym whole life able believe covid would spread like wildfire one. probably big mistake health standpoint. people get allergies that's much smaller concern vaccinating hundreds thousands people. Hmm maybe tons restrictions get vaccine fucking dumb idea?

Jk know is. high risk medical workers, people nursing homes, shot arm shot arm. Open anyone 50 ASAP. UK estimated vaccinating people 50 would eliminate 99 percent excess mortality. Ahw snap, right.. time rooting police.. Report state. Ah ok, Indonesian. Thanks info.

That sad party pushing changes...

 think low pay kept low pushing people debt choice accept given job immediately. 

Normally economy grows workers get experience, change jobs often get better pay lowest paying jobs longer find someone them. constant stream desperate people need pay debts soon possible due high interest rates, wages stagnate, local workers well.

Of course long Indonesia average wage less half average Malaysian wages, people keep coming.

So government needs clamp human trafficking urgently...

They may able cooperate Indonesian government this.

We similar issues Europe complicated problem. 

Do know nationality smugglers are? Deaths usually 3 4 weeks behind cases surprising - probably another week two start see drop deaths. zero moral high ground. taking long use money have?

Edit add: Pfizer isn’t even good candidate developing countries use according WHO. vaccine needs stored minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94 F) said creates difficulties developing countries. currently approved vaccines, would enough this? need others approved happen day 1.  someone dealing antibiotic fatigue due Lyme coinfections year, fuck no. felt fully well year taken toll me, especially since two small kids kills can't play like want to. Gotcha. Thanks clearing up. Believe like 50% decrease cases story covid-19, story guy hid airport using employee's ID. Johnson &amp; Johnson can’t even get talcum powder right. barking wrong tree 'cases' 'deaths' since December. think that's good enough, well look California much stricter measures see doing. crazy different be. I'm glad I've chosen isolate nearly year. Rather that, get it.. players football team follow got (soccer). One months ago, fine ever since actually plays better ever has. look like he's lost step. One players recently it, clearly tell gassed is. Last week came last 15 minutes game, could see trouble keeping pace game generally sluggish. first player mention 31, one 23 year old pro athlete barely 15 minutes it. 31 makes old physically weaker all, says needs say me. way food shops get one person door time

Honestly shocked you’re really dense this. vaccine delivered us. don’t transport it. People can’t get hub wait Oxford vaccine Thank you!

Even still sounds like know. ""May contributed"" seem definitive. 

Basically I'm trying say want assume vaccine deadly elderly actually proven.  Could tell please. tested positive Thursday 3 days scratchy throat. fever starting worse cough. means ""positive test 2+ weeks ago"" I’m sorry - don’t know names. Looked couple - retired athletes died COVID. question. Please name WELL KNOWN athlete currently active struggling regain form due long haul COVID symptoms? follow NBA league European pro soccer leagues - thousands athletes compete heard cases like even though due active lifestyle currently COVID anyone actually read article?? talks literally one 58 year old patient, quotes single doctor. hardly evidence. plenty way better articles studies long covid article shit. used smoke chance? Assuming single dose J&amp;J vaccine effective single dose vaccines simply logical. data soon, based high hopes people around think many disappointed.

One thing learned whole crazy time immune system weird wonky thing seems logical isn't. difference pfizer (50's) moderna (80's) protections one shot time found surprising given similar technologies. knows J&amp;J may surprise us. I'm guessing great mRNA, probably closer AZ. I'd love proven wrong!

I surprised second trial gets better results using two shot regimen but, think storage requirements impactful able get away one dose. virus. That's viruses do. confused awhile, pretty much biden literally maintains current rate vaccinations, would meet 100 million dose easy, that's without J&amp;J Astra approved within next couple weeks. way friend. finding ant-inflammatory meds helpful pain? I’m sorry dealing complications. hope doctors able get figured ASAP start feeling better. doesn’t explain anything right... virus fucking weird. didn’t even feel sick, runny nose lost sense smell day it. days later wife came it.

Ugly Americans America? Wow! proved everything said deleted too! Holy fuck! Wow! proved everything said deleted too! Holy fuck!  West Virginia still strong culture independent pharmacies. allowed state government reject partnership CVS/Walgreens local pharmacies distribution. pharmacies know small towns operate already connected senior living centers able readily set distribution.

Obesity (from excess adipose tissue) carries host health issues besides “more mass diaphragm move / decreased lung capacity”.
It directly impairs immune system, causes pro inflammatory state, causes hormone imbalances, often accompanied insulin resistance, etc. it’s flu sounds pretty amazing someone hates eating.

What really setting blow target water lol

Tomorrow he’s going back work without getting retested. Noticed pandemic radicalized lot people would traditionally fit far right umbrella. lot people conspiratorial thinking past eras would’ve found pipeline left end far right shut downs &amp; masks. get canceled &amp; isolated original social group find solace people accepting &amp; get red pilled things like Q-Anon. 

I Notice former colleague mine fell rabbit hole last year. She’s lesbian obviously didn’t fit normal brief Far Right extremist worked conservative climate &amp; heard conservative anti mask anti lockdown pandemic talking points every day. got indoctrinated that, fell &amp; starts believe pandemic hoax conspiracies reads online. rabbit hole gets deeper &amp; deeper falls &amp; alt right. Less year pandemic she’s gone Kamala Harris Liberal, Tomi Lahren Far Right extremist already prone conspiratorial thinking. get even live state?  know. Nobody seems know. fatigue muscle pain continue regularity. Almost like Lupus flare never goes away. returned premier cancer center, testing including MRI. Also insurance provides cancer coach. I'm asking right questions care team. seem put available data together yet, way find correlations. honestly know know long term effects.

30 year olds get may well high chance living current age cut off. think wait this. Something very, wrong. Thing is, even normal seasonal flu, new season new strain that's outpaced vaccines previous season's strain. I'm sure would different. type allergy test go for? imagine pro, someone making sure getting best care. NHS. Makes giving vaccines purchase national level hell lot easier handing states, states handing private companies hospitals 50k? Wait... what. supposed stop going groceries. way you’ll literally starve. 

It’s like everyone lives huge city like New York bring groceries door nowadays. That’s misconception. It’s backward country taste wealth post war boom. would hardly call first world. Engagement money, negative emotions drive engagement. Modern journalism literally designed make mad. Yeah that’s true. graduated year ago I’m truths regarding Chinese government initially baddies, blocking information trying save face. separately, Americans fault typical greedy executives backhanded government deals, providing proper information support citizens masks. shitty, power individuals education North Star. think people mental health problems get help? pretty unusual vaccine whereby second dose given weeks first rather months years, Pfizer choose 3 weeks optimal would make phase 3 trials go quicker. scientists expect stronger immunity generated longer dose interval, 3 weeks arguably short, indeed found AZ/Oxford vaccine. gets paid $2.27 million year, college much popular pro's. Championship game Notre Dame Baylor averaged 3.6 million viewer. boat. we’re still blitzed moving goal posts June I’m saying fuck Sure, part semi-obscure piece japanese media. I'm saying couldn't've happened, think likely. Earlier pandemic, people explained recoveries limited form herd immunity, later proved wrong.

It contribute degree, many factors. heard news item claiming many testing centers using test likely produce false negative new variant previous variants.

Great. great.

I think updating test maybe ought bit priority. moment negative test symptoms assumed new variant COVID updated test obtained. Really doesn't.

Here UK mental health issues taken seriously either.

It's difficult prescribed medication without told overreacting doctors automatically assume addicted mentally ill. need prove mentally unstable - also applies receiving benefits sick leave.

I verge killing could get someone take problems seriously.

Many countries similar problems. Mental health rarely taken seriously. Nobody except laypeople assumed anything. scientific responsibility say ""we data"" data. got covid, great.  Mostly wealthy donors want anyone talking raising taxes pay people stay home, message ""personal responsibility"" get people arguing blaming instead realizing that.   Aight straight lie dude. know place despises lock downs c'mon man, controlled jack shit.

In fact, I'm sure could've done worse job controlling National Spit Neighbors Mouth Day. Cases worst they've been, deaths worst they've been, hospitalizations, worst they've ever articles overwhelmed hospital systems hit fp every day.

If ever time big lockdown, 2 weeks ago would've perfect time it. government given even trying ever since Summer, I'm sure delight.

My state issued new lockdowns restrictions since fucking May restricted indoor dining, really know y'all even complaining about. Since we've relented restrictions done nothing despite cases growing every single day.

Sometime summer said ""masks enough"" been. finally, actually peak, pray last week, would masks people restricting own, government done fuck all. That’s big statement make given different vaccines are. make feel better. Thanks! Wow. volunteer Kaiser Permanente let one volunteers get leftover dose without appt anything. got first dose Saturday. Uhh, like burnt eggs. Hate smell taste much.. notice Reddit. reason, everyone still attitude lucky live catch even luckier lasting effects recovering.

It's like people ignore actual hard data. many areas US hospitals completely overwhelmed. family working hospital SoCal stories I’m hearing pretty grim. 

Even non COVID patients can’t get care need moment. 

Is case live? Prepare shit sub people get vaccinated head back normal. significant portion thrive negativity, good news dominates front page, comments get toxic. worldview fair labor laws, equal treatment towards LGBT people, mental health awarness dismissed morally absolute. 

This basic human dignity.  Money reason crap going right  Yea cancel Mardi Gras That’s train coming towards He's mostly right. *Tons* kids never really used computer lives, certainly one home, use smartphone literally everything.

I'm gonna go extremely stupid. ITT: existence immunocompromised people forgotten, death accepted natural consequence bad actors.

Why job read small book prove point oh easily give relevant info?

I’m homework.

Good heavens find hobby SEPPUKU I'd take education putting $100,000 debt (which probably low side IMO). clarified day later remember how, March April, people grasping straws desperately trying justify would matter weeks, despite facts mostly pointing towards much much longer timeline?

Jeez, seems like can't swing dead cat w/o hitting Ok, Boomer head days! see 100M doses, please give link wrong. would happy Feel free scroll 4 years content. It’s unreal people think control serve “power going head”. voting comments, seems consensus people “We’re used treating grocery workers like dirt, we’re going enter establishment without mask you’ll serve us feel like it’s time, decide can”.

Christ, we’re private property. It’d like showing friends house refusing take shoes ask you, sitting couch ask leave. justifying saying “lol, nobody respects you.” There’s evidence trail. see way. 

Trump disbanded pandemic task force. Trump cut cdc budget 2018. 2019 cdc lost funding program, “global health security alert” that’s stopped monitoring chinas meat market+. 

Then pandemic conveniently comes one year later president calls hoax. Doesn’t even try protect us. Instead uses reformat economy country. Bailed big corporations destroyed small businesses. 

So much I’ll stop now. Fine them. That's little extreme. surprise since country anal exams. quite sad. McDonalds ball pit. 20 kids. 1 yours, 19 antivaxxers. ok scenario. question

Soooo... get free pass ""for anything"" every criticism comes ""white millennials"" obviously ""think know country actually do""?

What fool... Say something silly like November 30th.

Not silly, cuz piss everyone another reason.

Picking something reasonable realistic, terms getting vaccine also considering public actually accept willing hold for. 

June 30th. give enough time vaccine roll outs get opened right time big holiday weekend. Exactly. could live something happened could prevented. we’ll online game playdates they’ll enjoy talking best bud next door walkie talkies. play outside too. That's conclusion drawing study. test people second dose. compare second dose versus first dose. None things nearly bad Thanksgiving Christmas.

Most families stay home Super Bowl. single men care getting together Super Bowl, probably already hanging others.

Everyone, including you, makes ignorant assumptions, demonstrated here. risk actually covid infection extremely low. risk fact inflammation disease healthy children higher think parent likes, children kept apart large group extent. long term effects children completely unknown. Hopefully none, definitely none many adults even asymptomatic got it. someone sub said France huge number anti-vaxers, active even pandemic. part culture unfortunately. never travel either, family members friends do.

Well thats good. 🍻 benefits island nation tiny population think we're seeing pieces herd immunity here, passed holiday numbers.

My county seeing trend too, total 9k cases history compared population 230k.

If uncounted cases early assume around 20k cases, that's still 9%. still nowhere near high percent needed near herd immunity. COVID back summer loss sense smell taste several weeks. way worse happens regular cold. regular cold dulls things, still smell taste really strong things. COVID absolutely nothing. Fortunately, things returned normal couple weeks, really hope never experience anything like again.  Exactly. looking stats lot. Good Trader Joe’s! employees don’t get paid enough deal crap daily basis. I'll tell unknown. Without immunity hundreds thousands die. risk benefit analysis authorities UK clearly decided worth greater question approach result selectivity potentially results new mutation spreading bypasses immunity.

You'd get 2 dose schedule well also get new variants good evading immune response (which specific vaccines) shit tonnes virus circulating amongst population.

Not saying anything wrong US approach waiting data lets undermine authorities responses either. ""they never call way again!"" dude morning exams pretend care people excuse judgmental, care old people. Vaccines exist protect vulnerable people. Americans particularly guilty devaluing elders, here. unlikely young person would die virus, vaccine meant protect people would susceptible dying it. caring fucked. go ad hominem instead addressing actual points made -- attempting refute would show hypocrisy. It’s pausing one lot, every Moderna vaccine CA. issue vaccine - possibility issue one lot vaccine. extremely important distinction understand. Vaccination certificates could also works guys well. workplace allowing us call without COVID negative test even migraine diarea, use sick time waiting negative result.

I feel like making people use sick time, week, opposite effect intending. It’s exact false argument Covid deniers started last March, applied vaccinations “Boohoo didn’t get way”- syndrome real, damit According scientists Reddit super spreaders vaccinated!  this
lmao
fuckin weebs Lol what? mention said thinking STARTING TRT. ignorant you? I’ve never done drug life, man. one scientist's opinion based high antibody levels. know vaccinated person contagious actually measure vaccinated people exposed virus. kind data going hard collect because, experience symptoms, would know tested?

The question is, exposed, vaccinated person harbor number virus eliminated them? could share virus interval? can't imagine get numbers that.  Oh that's great hear, still change fact rushed properly tested. Cool, stop forcing vaccinated people wear mask. could great way incentivize jab. Oh stop hating state actually right side things.  agree, US shouldn’t made appear worse country. Doesn’t mean it’s well, like countries top 10. 

I’m UK, government made absolute shit show whole situation numbers pretty crazy right now. I’m fully aware though, unlike many. Somebody else put ""it takes less time potty train toddlers puppies"" agree more. Wow, thank experts! insightful found vaping strong marijuana hybrid helped me. it, top body aches coughing, point could breathe well believing going die. going cold turkey marijuana awhile, vaped felt lot better. believe marijuana would help infection afterwards due marijuana's anti-inflammatory properties. recommend it. 

I spreading ""misinformation."" sharing experience viewpoint. would vape smoke it, however, partake. doctor. But, give marijuana try. we’d stay inside wear masks forever logic. Immunocompromised people stay risk years. Obviously right it’s important end. also caused Trump. Operation ""warp speed"" told states going give plan resources vaccinate population.

Then last minute basically said good luck figure yourselves. Well judging many mentally ill people throw streets.... vaccinated population could relax border restrictions. help NZ’s significant tourism industry, allow NZ citizens safely travel abroad return without quarantine.

April kinda late, I’d assumed earlier.  Tedros catastrophic moral failure. Rarely doctors check patients physiological problems, attitude anxiety caused emotional problems, could be. Dude need get military shit. Give week course safely handle administer vaccines get giving people doses. good reason this? made come office risk health working home obviously possible. Spoiler alert. give fuck you.  pretty unusual vaccine whereby second dose given weeks first rather months years

Uhhhh...no? may booster shots given years initial series shots, part multi-dose vaccines use US second dose either 1 2 months first. $30 million ten countries really much. Even wiki article goes far saying ""large global cult following,"" usually means small dedicated fan base. really read what's written there, entry actually dispute overall point BR.

Again, I'm saying happen, think highly unlikely. author states never heard BR before, ultimately, think matters did. Serious question. say can’t go back normal even vaccinated vulnerable may protected. stop?) vulnerable always risk. stop? never get back normal logic. ok. dead already.  Same!! watch YouTube videos people walking different cities virtual outings 😂 95% effective, hence name, since SARS-CoV-2 N sized particle.

But also requires proper fit. improper fit drastically lowers effectiveness. refrigerator morgues get every time. Like badly failed manage infection reduce numbers dead almost year. Yes exactly! wouldnt hold breathe UK government anything... still charging park car parks denying pay rise. Fucking devils. Operation warp speed success approve J&amp;J AZ/Ox shit  Yeah. We're holiday surge seems. ICU admissions probably little bit. I'm even objecting this, unknown. give greater even odds correct, can't sure point. greater question approach result selectivity potentially results new mutation spreading bypasses immunity. average Canadian view mental health, though? I'm neither Canadian Japanese, feel like average Canadian lot accepting mental health issues average Japanese person?

Idk, anecdotal best, I'm sure media consume effects view SinoPharm published detailed phase III data like SinoVac? think SinoPharm's numbers preliminary results? one said anything like went ignorant tirade made stupid assumptions. 

You refund clients, too. You’re clearly ill-equipped.

Enjoy life. Maybe people hospitalized Covid first place type go hospital often. need compare er visits traumatic injury establish anything relevant revelation WHO! things ""could have"" done. Oxford actually *superior* efficacy longer delay doses, 1) sample size small 2) might due presumed vector immunity problem might apply mRNA vaccines. know Pfizer study it, trial volunteers got 6 weeks apart instead 3 least problems.

""There isn’t much Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, trials **did compare** different dose spacing compare one two doses. trials Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine include different spacing doses, **finding longer gap (two three months) led greater immune response**, overall participant numbers small."" understanding immunology really complicated one would able say sure without data, quite possible prolonged interval first second dose would lead lasting immune memory shorter interval mRNA vaccines well. mean, obviously giving two doses day apart would good, know best combo 3 weeks 3 months apart tested. Plenty blame go around sure. getting vaccinated year happen? I’m Maryland, phase 3 - super non essential young. I’ve definitely lost hope I’m getting year hope I’m wrong. Can’t take much :(  That’s deal idiots! Imagine America brave. operation warp speed absolutely killing stated above...several old people nursing home died getting vaccine, no. That's problem solved. mean always like this. kid school required vaccinates.

Colleges also require it, even jobs. Others hid home winding police.  that's moral absolutism. I'm simply advocating leaving cultures alone. want advocate LGBT rights welcome culture. right criticize cultures live them? True. doesn’t matter quick fed ships vaccines, many states sitting huge amounts doses. read lots states overwhelmed, CA worst. don’t live US though I’m going read. mean disinformation? models predicting 2 million deaths US.

You also try running hot water putting on. (The fog temperature difference breath surface glasses.) work well detergent though. that's fair point since original poster said ""better US"". point Japan isn’t really good job, yeah better United States.

Less 6k country 126m people sounds like fucking dream.

In world good job? could see minor second spike UK variant becomes dominant, can’t high many Ohioans Covid or, soon be, vaccine. I’m anymore.  Vaccinate. government officials aware long term damage illness causes

Tinfoil hat time: know know making clear us long term issues would make us panic, since they're already incredibly shitty job trying control spread would make people even pissed off. Im 27yr old firefighter caught covid last year, heart still cant stand anything slow walk, idea complication back then. people vaccinated, overall. Here's clue. dividing world worth saving (with favoured group, natch) baddie. two dose vaccines second dose provide lasting immunity (they already 90% effective two weeks first dose). I’m wondering J&amp;J’s one dose vaccine overcome this, simply going long lasting two?

Sorry rain everyone’s parade, one seems superior without talk downsides, need ask: what’s catch. still weights leaves winded. wish best luck everything fam, hopefully get kind help disaster. Depression may happen also. Good hear healthy though. seen Meme toddlers easier potty train adult individuals figuring use face mask? We're getting point enough people going slow own. California relatively people get virus that's cases still going up. Arizona things considered... I'm sure situation Florida would think numbers would lower already happening cases covid make unqualified life insurance feel you. I'm Los Angeles somehow art department warehouse job essential, even though health department SAG-AFTRA advised production shut while. like million cases right now... course! one learns lesson. People spouting “rare!” context 

But you’re free call whatever want hun Go away troll. many people want imagine we're somewhere close herd immunity form, realize huge number people interactions society. Even lot uncontrolled spread last year gotten close everyone random crowd would immune. assume guys also enjoy holding large watch parties throughout season especially big games, judging states collective ratings games. right ya... rough even introvert myself. everything threat... 

I really want thing close getting vaccine... mean, way works. one day smell taste coming back yea weird. black coffee tasted salty. Later made popcorn smelled like wet dog Dependency addiction refusing? refusing least 1 variation covid vaccine might useful on? refusing putting others front themselves? refusing want see long term effects vaccine? don’t quote relevant bit hun?

If virus spanish flu, would already over. Natural herd immunity would already taken place anything could done. guess okay start. old boss vocal displeasure corporate policies force compliance precautions ICU weeks.

Last heard they're struggling keep oxygen levels up.

He's good guy hope pulls through.

Also Texas. idk, mean read articles like think 'i'm already lot, agree' Hey congrats! Thats good you!

My step father became dependent/addicted vicodin highschool, advice came from! also relayed advice friend earlier year confided addicted vicodin prescribed. 

Im assuming meant say Vicodin vidicon common incorrect way people referred it. Vicodin opiate analgesic nature addictive/habit forming would get mad. medical staff; know unethical. Offer bring old people end day get leftover jabs. I’m sure know old family members neighbors would show up.  corrected saying could phrased better obviously meant 5-6 weeks. stop it, picking fight now. told needed lock year wait vaccine could go back normal.....

&amp;#x200B;

That's still plan. Yeah bro, already know everything time stop learning forever. sick? covids? ThAts overreaction. Kids home schooling successfully decades really different getting medical care grocery store? also. Even cloth bandaid. 3 vaccines approved March. Curevac might allso approved Germany pressures EMA. 

Also current production increase drastically. Saying lack social awareness giving pass. know. care.  locking cities hundred detected cases, though, I'm sure they're really ""downplaying"".

They downplaying sense numbers obviously reporting know. downplaying approach. sure- they're prescribed (hopefully) give much pain relief possible without allowing addiction. told think taking feel ""less bad"" vs taking feel ""good.""

I'm really sorry still struggle pain. best friend also suffers chronic pain condition. generally controlled live normal life background pain, currently holding treatments get COVID vaccine, starting get bad again. difficult see struggling can't imagine terrible must actually experience it. 

I agree much needs done chronic pain field. I'm actually medical student really interested going chronic pain management. really picking specialty hopefully means research dollars projects follow! one, that's called example. ONE one largest important hospitals world.

Nobody got props. far. Maybe get joint one, would least devalue prize political posturing.  Well outgoing person. probably went 7-8 times outside enitre year 2020. sorry supposed know need aggressive it. Yes keep mind choice preserving 7% economy versus keeping .3% people alive. Dakota's done pandemic mid late February basically done now. It’s nice share experience reply many people going this. I’m 3m behind posting reply. wish well journey recovering full taste. What's scary little ""cultural"" antibodies society has.

Media hypes truth. Nobody checks. Governments use hype enslave populations world, good, nobody bats eye.

It's really really scary, even get covid thing next emergency effect dumb gullible public. Yea author tries mock yuppies rich people understand disconnect pandemic well-enough-off person work home writing articles. basically says 'I travel air I'm stupid,' people must travel. people must exposed others dangerous environments products like may step towards helping could get honest review them. 

I mean oversensitive find type cynicism helpful. People thought looked stupid overcareful wear mask, too, look got us. glandular fever heard horror stories friends who’d it, warning could leave sorts months vulnerable lot longer. sort passed 3-4 weeks, still one worst things I’ve experienced. Think went 8 hours without swallowing one point. -70C storage requirement makes difficult developing countries hard convince people get shot drop hat.

Imagine doctors nurses running streets crying “free jabs CoVID” anyone would skeptical.

Meanwhile spouses frontline doctors nurses ready, easily reached.

Definitely set standby lists community, brow beat people going efficient route. 🤦‍♀️ Lol Jesus, I’ve always taken flu vaccine Never gotten flu. kid parents would send us parties get chicken pox. last time saw kid chicken pox? It’s basically gone vaccine, luckily came could catch them.  Yeah I'm waiting, chances vaccine 40% effective sudden people telling us people got us Check covidlonghaulers subreddit. real thing. Myles Garrett says still can’t breath well elicit IgA need protect respiratory tract. No. said ignored 5-6 weeks cavalier.

You accused “lockdown-4-ever” person, based solely discussion 5-6 weeks.

So.... see works? mutation virus ever completely negated previously accumulated protection ...? checked information instead arguing seen recent article effectively says exact things I've saying math. 

""Health authorities Norway sought allay safety concerns raised death elderly patients vaccinated Covid-19, saying there’s evidence direct link.""

And ""The Norwegian Medicines Agency says made clear vaccination program started “it expected deaths occur time-related context vaccination” “oldest sickest” people receiving inoculation."" mean that? like Russia great. lot non-totalitarian countries much better responses. wife tested positive Covid, quarantined room. ongoing dry cough, taste smell gone. I'm waiting today's Covid test results see I'm negative.

 ***If end positive asymptomatic, would safe go back room her, even still constantly coughing?*** actually anti-mask, ""covid cold"" protests JP. people seem minority though. Spanish imperialist language tho wtf less complicated, depending look it. Good luck exam! worrisome .... and, 94, hey.... 94. frankly tougher rest us. bet hoot. listen stories everyone managed war years get manners tips her. lucky you. enjoy remember. 24 months! think proposing 100 days. testament America's best-in-the-world medical system. Sounds like discrepancy narrowed considerably since last time looked first implemented reporting change. also aware countries reporting deaths within 28 days (or similar time limit). reason saw news articles pertaining UK -- least UK pretty transparent explicitly clarifies this!

Thanks response! Covid-19 ""Just like flu."" damage cardiac, respiratory, neurological systems serious, apparently permanent. Older Americans may vulnerable, young, healthy, athletic people contacting Covid, dying it, left serious residual effects. medical problems caused Covid follow us decades. said absolutely zero math. said 'not likely' connected vaccine direct contradiction Norwegian health officials. outright wrong. older friend broke hip last year doctor said 1/3 chance death next year. much hip replacement sign frailty aging. Found cancer 2 months later dead January- admitted hospital kinds implications overall health. ""Right now, I’m fide resects,"" 

haha not? restrictions even that...well...strict bit sweeping statement say half world's landmass heavily polluted eh?

go industrial hub states see air soil's clean restrictions inherently tied executive orders mandated them. Upon EOs lifted too. meantime, make terms perfectly clear, following require business us. people don’t listen call police; don’t say anti masker, tell there’s trespasser property won’t leave.

Reminds early days pandemic toilet paper shortage limited customers one package. lady thought ridiculous therefore didn’t listen it, tried buying multiple packages self checkout. went empty register kept transferring order register couldn’t pay. clue going on, could see scanned second package order disappeared.

I’ve dealing public years, especially past year, can’t stand people think rules subject agreeing them. walk someone else’s establishment *you get choice*. time reaches me, nobody care since older immune compromised good go anyway. infection low tests pick up, certainly can't wreak havoc inside body. virus multiplies constantly. That's reason existing. low infection means immune system won. Yeah, that’s wanted sympathize guy first, told 7 times cover nose, you’d think he’d try find different solution. getting downvoted, right. authority figures people listen to, grocery store managers near bottom totem pole. 827k confirmed cases 4-5x number total cases, Ohio 40% infection point truthers resistance longer source spread. seen similar trends places like Dakotas Wisconsin tipping point around 40-50% infections. 

I hardly call waiting “herd immunity” good job although seems case states like Vermont. someone lives TWO nurses battling this, wish could lucky relatives. Everyday filled anxiety get vaccinated way get chance. tooth paste tastes like egg white. gross. vaccine kill them, worsened underlying conditions conditions responsible death?

Thats like saying alcoholic died cirrhosis die alcohol. talking disease much MUCH infectious flu, deadlier. 

Not 80%+ population vaccinated, think countries like Australia got right fun wherever death restrictions I’m sure you’re dealing with.

I'm talking policy *post-vaccination*. think makes sense lockdown single case COVID detected 80% wider population vaccinated? 27 yr old physically fit firefighter here: stay fuck away covid, December (nice Christmas Eve present patient picked up) still can’t go back shift heart rate skyrockets anytime move around, I’m talking 200BPM slow jog. didn’t even serious symptoms first, happened lost taste smell.  time hasnt figured wear mask glasses didnt much change passing uni test anyway. Unless first time wearing mask... Same. actuallly think best article new vaccine technology ever read. concerning because

A. vaccine, still get covid, dont get sick bad, get symptoms

B. dont get initial symptoms, kinda thing come back later? must proud  Last time math 150 expected deaths per day vaccine group, welcome math see actual deaths higher lower expected number came back skiing trip lol it’s going like regular. Really isn’t bad since many show anyway keep talking cleanliness. respiratory virus. think McDonalds ball pit/jungle gym/whatever limited pool local kids using somehow higher risk covid one disney THOUSANDS children going thru, disagree. Also, capacity control like mentioning. talking normal. Back normal means back normal. You’re talking disease much MUCH infectious flu, deadlier. think countries like Australia got right fun wherever death restrictions I’m sure you’re dealing with. kinda suspect right hyper awareness. got beginning December (even though extra cautious living two people ended getting us sick). whenever feel fatigue muscle weakness, heart palpitations shortness breath think damnit again. Whereas before, rare occasions would happen like, yeah need rest fine.

I hope lasting damage us (as seems far). wish could get vaccination poll country showed high percentage people wanting vaccine optimistic it. classic correlation != causation. Maybe avid runners go races interact people there? Maybe weather more? Maybe avid runners tend know likely get cold?

How fact study even include people run marathon? Anyone runs marathon likely trains lot average person really ""non athletes"" least medical standpoint. “You knew meant”

No, knew wrote.

It isn’t pedantic- 

As example- got first vaccine shot one said single Word protected yet. knew that, warning, “hey still get COVID” 
Despite huge vaccination drive (think 1k+ people).

Absolutely information.

So no, random Redditor, don’t know mean something different said.

And fact think waiting 5-6 weeks everyone get “lockdown forever” proves point.

You’re wrong, you’re advocating carelessness. people supposed quit jobs go work? supposed quit job hate covid cases surging county job requires go work anyways? COVID late October. low fever (technically even fever) mild headache day got tested. went away hours. lost taste 3 days later, came back next night. That's had, symptoms since.

I tested heart lung damage problems. think stories like really play worse fears even they're statistically likely.

And heart lung damage mom deep shit stupid work bringing house lmao Okay, so... none.

If choose take it, deserve consequences.

The school closures already caused tremendous harm daughter. must go back school 5 days per week full day beginning September. Eradication never option. unless vaccinate every wild bat, mink, cat earth. COVID ICU nurse entire year March USA attest never worked overtime entire life past year. never care many ventilated patients last year. COVID ICU 17 beds 3 week time frame sign 14 condolence cards families. People show 13+ hour shifts like long. folks lost ability smell taste, get senses back? Mine still partially active feel confident they’ll come back I’ve heard everything like week 4 months.  think difference that, know Super Bowl is, idea NC is. Admittedly, sports person assuming level population share ignorance/ disinterest NC may interested Super Bowl parties social aspect (but again, care little sports wouldn’t go Super Bowl party best times). almost month ago, Christmas/New Year Fair point.

But even  heard way easier get free sample rounds black... Look much freedom people Australia have, compare people UK announced nationwide lockdown would extended March. record, live communist country love irony freedom western countries still wear masks. expect it'll maintained vaccine drive? ignored precedent might set hospital directors could mysteriously family turn ready shots day excess vaccines. agree dose go waste though think work tho. national exsm give next month strictly monitored really allowed even wear sort clothing beyond say. wanna trouble least desire it. lolllll 👍 holidays talking point? Yeah going actually get education. people time get good education play basketball full-time reason apologizing?

It’s kinda like inside trading. relatives got vaccines told it, even though probably plethora people wanted outside hospital.

While it’s bad used, puts hospital tricky spot community loses trust hospital since protected community meant serve.

I’m saying awful, PR standpoint, better approach possible. So, want written headstone grandma's? Well maybe could phrased bit better. mean everyone wants protected vaccine protected vaccine. need aggressive tone absolutely knew meant.

The ""but KNOW vaccines provide sterilizing immunity"" talking point constantly spouted experts repeated media needs move beyond black white scenario.

It guaranteed (I would bet 1000 1 odds) vaccinated provides sterilizing immunity. vaccinated reduces symptoms, [we know asymptomatic spread much less prevalent symptomatic Q.E.D.

It guaranteed (I would bet 10 1 odds) vaccinated provides majority sterilizing immunity — though small sample size, Moderna's data indicated 66% reduction nasal viral load 21 days one dose, [we would expect grow strength time second vaccinated today, 10 days would reduce overall caution half, month would reduce 80%. Exactly. one, including, state’s department health, clue what/when/where. confirm 100 percent. worked home since March hardly went except get groceries ended getting covid. asymptomatic mild symptoms. 15 days fine post covid almost month felt like dying energy even sit front laptop got retested couple times thinking maybe recovered. 

this October. better able run workout feel impact memory thing... dizzy hell  heart tests before. thought clear.

It missed scarring. think heart stopping massive surprise. know started second trial two doses preliminary results first trial right? I'm Utah following developments there, noticed case fatality rate surprisingly low. 1month average case fatality rate [lowest country 0.46%](http://91-divoc.com/pages/covid-visualization/?chart=states-normalized&amp;highlight=Utah&amp;show=us-states&amp;y=both&amp;scale=linear&amp;data=mortalityRate-daily-30&amp;data-source=merged&amp;xaxis=right#states-normalized) (US average 1.3%). total cases per capita high test positivity also high unusual deaths relatively low. anyone heard ideas Utah seeing many fewer deaths states? Could difference cause death reported death certificates? Maybe Americans overall, probably age range. states shall go nameless. Guy looks like anti-Walter White fair towards Biden goal, trying set low expectations case damage repair vaccine deployed. Today first day office long time. Surprisingly, got laughed almost everyone office(roughly 30 people) wearing N95 mask surgical mask it( doctor's advise) better protection.
Everyone found funny I'm afraid something even real..
I idea people mind days.... Imagine bad would one wearing masks Japan fucked up. Outside great image americans love worship, much wrong society traditions. also untrue easy check  Try putting medical tape nose bridge, form seal. Works wonders me.

It’s small amount vaccine point compared population, it’s also dissemination, communication, disposal “extra” end day. It’s fine governors mayors responsible ground implementation, guidelines. fcking ridiculous. seems Italy much earlier. 

This nonsense. easy say earlier retrospective sample analyses released china. china release data, proof? mean China genetically engineering Covid 19 attack world?

Of course wasn't. Nobody arguing that. question accidental leak natural virus. People need stop conflating two takes vaccines take full effect. First dose reportedly around 50% effective 10-12 days, 3-4 weeks doses, another week 2nd dose 90-95% immunity. vaccines obviously help people already it.

Hospitalizations fatalities decline first since occur among elderly vaccinated first. bet they'll see good declines within week two. wake call 13 year old. stopped coming me. care school work. asked ask help. said busy working. hurt. Somehow going find way engaged day. know also get work done. Got keep pace!

Edit - forgot add. together :) way. data really critical? need minute minute update many vaccines people got obsess over? That's ridiculous Great point, let's lockdown communicable diseases, let's also ban cars road traffic accident. sad proponents lockdowns forget lockdowns save lives still wrong strategy used inappropriately. 400K people dead rising people still act like overblown. Sociopaths. Nursing Home Admin here...out 80 employees, 15 took vaccine first clinic. I’ve offered everything think of, cash, time off, TVs, etc. won’t budge. Same.  StUpiD NuRSe

Yes, learn communicate. Stop pretending care pandemic healthcare workers, poser. keep talking nonsense internet real work. I’m early 40s. Clearly I’ve menstruating years, right? five years ago, found great nurse practitioner, every appointment unmanageable endo pain resulted getting lecture drug-seeking behavior. 

Meanwhile, I’ll contractions make vomit collapse knees intensity pain. 

The honest truth I’m wired addiction. Plus, opiates make feel dumb cranky days; I’m always relieved period ends don’t need while. almost exact symptoms person, I’m process getting chest X-ray done, blood work pulmonary test. echo came back irregularities. doctor said anxiety could causing beware triple bypass three years ago, think lungs never fully recovered anesthesia. I’m radical extreme avoiding exposure. First shot couple days, feels better Christmas! It’s like going grocery store. wear mask inside, social distance everyone, get want, head outside.  pandemic. extrmely serious. 

Here US leadership failure even come close setting right tone literlaly criminal. light end tunnel gets brighter brighter...... excellent news!  vaccine passport entry! Every different culture poor minority groups soccer moms rich influencers runs gathering. strict rules. gathering still constantly happens.

Here Midwest, don’t large Latino population huge family gatherings everyday. don’t rich white people mansions throwing daily parties. parents probably made commit seppuku afterwards lol. found vaping strong marijuana hybrid helped me. it, top body aches coughing, point could breathe well believing going die. going cold turkey marijuana awhile, vaped felt lot better. believe marijuana would help infection afterwards due marijuana's anti-inflammatory properties. recommend it. ...goddamn 29, English Karen less. Yeah bet big building, one available medical staff infrastructure process vaccinate 98 people *per* *minute* top stock refrigerated vaccine constant state replenishment due British also suddenly inventing teleportation. fantastic? 

Fuck outta bullshit literally used covid form genocide. CDC full shit Israel definitely ahead UK USA similar strategies focus elderly at-risk. US caught health care workers changing. Japan takes Karens, even male ones, fast. mean, spreading truth, hard provide peer reviewed source. Yet are. Dodging again. US gaining deaths per capita ranks though, Europe slowing actually tried something fall/winter wave rather letting go. US already passed worst-hit European countries like France Spain, could easily overtake UK Italy next months. end surprised US ahead every European country except maybe Belgium. I’m thanking good fucking lord I’ve somehow gone whole year almost without testing positive even scare. It’s sucked dearly miss public mild depression worth compared able fucking breathe first case Wuhan started experiencing symptoms December 1st, 2019. multiple cases virus confirmed Italy November 2019. Sewage samples taken November 27th, 2019 Brazil also tested positive, implying community whole sh*t started Wuhan, China.

Would mind explaining holds even modest scrutiny? going feel sad him, sometimes I'm hyperventilating really want mask off, excuse listen instruction 7 times. Like, water whenever wanted take deeper breath?  world would ruins acted like states global infection rate would least x10 higher now. China act fastest could given century type pandemic say pretty well containing alerting world. Sure, could faster, doubt country apart singapore could faster them.   Omg :/. You’re absolutely right - social animals. able zoom/Skype? helpful this. I’m excited too!!! Lol. It’s seriously amazing - cervix, uterus tubes removed 100% best decision ever made myself. highly recommend getting one u-shaped pregnancy pillows recovery, helps ton. Also give heal, it’s big surgery, don’t push much beginning. awful grinding open wound pain adeno gone immediately, makes feel healed keep mind decide sweep kitchen days surgery (ask know lmao). Good luck! Well NJ received 658,800 doses period. Unlike Israel share doses rest country. US states get allotment vaccine roughly proportional population. Yep. mild/moderate case. felt like brain rattled around head. Glad went away fairly quickly. article Norwegian, get main first vaccine city Stavanger went 105 year old.

When vaccinate 26 000 people 95 105 years old, die. vaccinate them, die. give bubble gum, die.


Norway basically giving people vaccines death bed. stupid. source states

If think that, read source comprehend it. article mentions people ages 40 50, line later says *up to* 35% people may experience long covid, number CDC includes severe covid at-risk conditions. obviously need research see incidence among different know pandemic gone, last infected immunized/have overcome actual infection outliers may still accumulate cannot accumulate anymore pandemic over.

No. final time, need wait end pandemic begin research aspects pandemic, like long term cases damage already identified permanent

What? mild cases? literally can't even say tissue damage permanent yet. Even tissue damage smoking permanent. know whether tissue healed yet? need working on, guess little scientist mastermind didn’t waste time anything keeping people didn’t notice pandemic drawing major resources, maybe hint, eli5 style science busy finding way immunize people, right don’t time study survivors collect data daily basis data changes, data new infections people dying due covid.

I noticed keeping people alive clearly resources study disease. need provide citation showing somehow money study long term effects covid despite fact already pointed small studies literally done studies dearly need(for whatever reason nurse need numbers keep people alive) won’t done next 4 years mate.

You pulled number right ass, mate. reason start now. kind idiot wants delay research need collect data produced observation, funny doctors don’t declare patients healthy, patients cured go doctor notify cured.

Which need *study* explicitly track fun that, 95 mio cases, 52 recovered(from covid, long term effects still need observe), 2.03 mio deaths....

Where even getting numbers? troll sure lmao  Google ""ear saver masks"".

Their primary job take pressure ears slightly changing way mask sits face. 

But also completely worked stop glasses getting fogged number folks know. can't tell exaggerating referring something missed. I've heard customers threatening people guns shop owners mocking customers wear masks. Yeah escapism part normal life void long like pent firecracker. going common. One thing keep mind.....what would take news report ""rollout going great"". situation, unless going absolutely perfectly would report that. Despite challenges already 1 million vaccinations day. Could better...yes.  think starting see positive effect US hospitalizations 6,000 peak. appear downslope, let's hope quickly falls cliff. mask nose wire, press firmly face. 

Local blood donation clinic’s latest protocol requires use surgical mask instead cloth mask. exactly that, didn’t fog even once. operator said Sunday test-taker Tokyo disobeyed exam supervisors' instructions cover nose, despite told 7 times total. disclose student's gender age said reason student's refusal unknown.

No sympathy me. dumbass move. Relevant quote, relevant username... whole package, huh? xD Unfortunately can't, one sister wife's busy 3 kids struggling much too. sisters either busy school grandparents won't, trust mom can't even pay attention something simple allergies let kid go street busy dog. trust issues there, I'd rather migraines risk kid's safety. 

I'm embracing chaos lol, doable honestly, need patience nice quiet newborn helps much. I'm sure chatroom apps, laptops rented school stuff school's website sure *can* do, thought tbh. child gets frustrated overwhelmed notice it, go sit bit decompress. Thankfully teacher crazy time crunches, one test 40 questions(for damn 6 year old that's even had), took various 10 minute breaks. gave us hour half it, fleshed bit could manage better frustrated guessing answers like gets point. work progress, added ADHD kids have, possible anxiety really makes challenge. know work, know that, easily overwhelms think. Why? can’t fucking read? Yep estimates 30% US population exposed end January, 10% vaccinated. immunity standpoint work. That's 40% ""herd immunity"" slow spread.

The vaccines targeted towards at-risk population much effective cutting hospitalizations deaths. think 20 year old grocery store workers!! oh see. okay, knowledge sounds like maybe right, sure though, need research further, thanks links Amen mean ""once responded""? responded issues.

1) BC loophole still open
2) Still offering 1k travelers returning stay home quarantine (essentially paid vacation) CRSB
3) Still lenient guidelines ""essential"" people coming US

It's 9 months they're still refusing act save lives...Canada deserves better this. say, pretty harsh didnt get warning I'm sure influenced film adaptations least. That’s boarding child neglect. Lol know situation, vertigo related concussion got years ago never fully recovered from. I’m sure covid didn’t help, retirement probably isn’t related it. Basement dwelling losers already nothing staying inside playing video games day suddenly reason feel vindicated it, want let go. I’m polio survivor, whole covid thing giving serious flashbacks. diseases similar except terms long-term effects. Polio survivors extensive nerve damage masked healing process, undamaged nerves overworked years, start breaking down. condition called post-polio sequelae, recognized Social Security disabling condition. covid virus possibly something similar bodies victims, learning effects might be. I’m really concerned children younger folks shrugging serious, actually don’t idea. Get vaccine, people.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* wouldn’t call fake. protect people (you breathe mask, catches particles coronavirus little escaping velocity directly towards mask breathe out) provide zero protection (someone else breathes coronavirus air, breath gaps mask). 

Theoretically everyone wore masks mouth nose would little contagion, even gaps nose. go way far find someone ability actually read, everyone else eats fear up, fucking love it. You’ll find many people agree  still foolproof. Avoiding probably infected people good idea, especially since things nurses general public full scrubs eye protection. There's couple different ways still get infected scenario.

If someone household tests positive, asshole quarantine. based exposure notification technology Android iPhone have, neither true. based recording nearby Bluetooth phones, manual tracking required. track app, better is, nowhere near complete data needed useful.

Currently, Finland, Germany, Italy, Ireland, Spain, Latvia, Croatia, Denmark, Netherlands Poland share exposures across apps, commonly 25k infections added per day across countries, contacts notified. nowhere near complete, must still 100k+ people who've exposed know otherwise getting informed, day, isolate get tested. going stop epidemic alone, hey, life saved worth it.

You can't use apps guarantee exposed, true. Still pretty useful. way really. go get groceries? make sure less people touch items around bunch people. happened unlucky really sucks. Yeah meant wear 'em way. put glasses mask. would done actually cheated? realize we’re need self preservation right? I’m young. I’ll probably fine. point isn’t remove every teensy bit personal risk, crush spread whole fucking thing ends. COVID doesn’t spontaneously generate. needs shared pool hosts. average person gets shares less 1 person, number new infections eventually shrinks zero ends. goes growing exponentially forcing rounds lockdowns mask laws. 

Presumably, given disdain masks, something affects right? So, pure self interest, wearing mask ensures bullshit ends sooner rather later. don’t care safety safety anyone else matter, smart play.  There's damage done infection happens. need test positive continuing symptoms. lungs damaged, hurt regardless whether still virus replicating.   Preach it. Hunger games book series first, debatable author watched BR writing series. It’s situation no-win. 

My older one literally asking night lose friends school. blaming kids do. caused regress fair bit basically effectively working 3 hours day push calls. watched slowly stop coming anything. She’s still fully back. 

So risk disease, risk mental health, risk shit judgmental people matter do. 

I’m tired.   much guidelines punishment following guidelines. work pharmacy board said pharmacist could lose license vaccinate outside guidelines. ridiculous. vaccinating whoever hell wants it. keep mind think made right decision especially since North Dakota particular pretty well control early on. willful, intentional decision that's best way put it. Actually revenue North Dakota pandemic. economy better projected based projections pandemic Yeah, checked Worldmeter (when get ads?) 7 day trend headed downward. But, know? Japans around 4000 deaths. one dense population world, think they’re quite great. honestly, places largest outbreaks right it’s really great comparison. somebody LIVES NYC say true. Lived Tempe.. large population stupid there. Sun damages people brains something. Uh able beat make athletic freak lol Could live 7 people tho, that's best guess. Yeah really boggling mind. Everyone knows lot people gotten now, many breathing problems months later? thinking 70% asymptotic people damage worse smoking years. articles sub promoting shit really shit bad anti mask nonsense.

I think social scene caused spread rather actual skiing. reddit even question? Oh really? Nah know actually test positive 3 decades. Maybe point. given way information keeps changing abruptly, sooner later theyll tell ull test positive 3 decades. people eat like bunch fucking idiots. Good job world. Due people’s stupidity, world NEVER open back things NEVER return normal. Nicely done 👍🏼   actually addressed rebuttal worthless incorrect numbers. blocked now, bye. are. would nice folks pro-social distancing side would also open admitting side effects though. culture nothing, out, black white. middle ground nuance. 

Another thought many daycares getting shuttered (“unnecessary” daycares) around emerge year so. Imagine challenges single parents obligate dual income parents face treated daycare “unnecessary” two years. That's mom said saw dick.  
I guess apple fall far whore tree! wish US schools wouldn’t fuck around masks like one. Sucks him. worn correctly. 

The picture curious me. Wouldn’t make sense stagger rows rows someone outside next rows someone middle? Seems rows people outside next one another isn’t much space people ends table. lot countries explosive growth right now. Well... weird. mean, totally get it, typical guidelines use anymore.

There many companies making vaccines apparently trumps administration didn’t think one buy lot of.

Trump dumb fuck course.

Thanks explanation. indeed regrettable people dying effect first dose kicks in. idea supply vaccines Norway? better position EU? asked peer review presented study.

My buddy military, refused travel could court-martialed.

Not everybody gets avoid travel. true others. Moderna claims stop 2/3 infected FDA commented data yet. current vaccines DayQuil extreme. monitored stop symptoms. virus. safe skiing possible? I've gone, places article least seem right: enforcing masks, maintaining records contact tracing, keeping people distanced, keeping people outdoors. Japan using trump method “no tests = cases” wrong. So, COVID starting Career Killer virus? Makes sense group minorities. worth risking whole community waive vaccination small groups. complications due allergies manageable compared mass outbreak. many people infected US?

Edit: Worldometers USCoronavirus Cases:
24,488,739

While agree that’s low estimate, low it? It’s genuine question don’t know. friend got sick July still testing positive Given brutal fall surge many states Midwest subjected to, suspect becoming difficult record numbers again. fact holidays helps course. OpEn Up!! wAsTiNg lYfE!!

Yeah, hospital workers aren’t wasting ability get time pandemic able see families don’t potentially infect them. Selfishness. remember this. read article? 7 warnings given disqualified. Thank you! love website. 6th month. pretty fucking far right-winger tipping point me, became inclined agree you, story couple weeks ago restaurant neighborhood got fined shut month broke rules opening patio tent provide open-air ventilation (it's cold live). responses saw predominantly along lines ""fuck yeah, covidiots, hope worth it,"" etc.

Thing is, place set give finger government spit face science whatever. taking pandemic entirely seriously, simply slipped misreading reopening rules. hear sheer joy people feeling restaurant fall another month behind paying rent, cooks waitresses losing income month, gross nauseating. people remember living like? know two families shut since March (like did) got summer anyway. It’s scary, even though I’ve disinfecting deliveries/packaging since February. try panicky psycho man, don’t even want open windows spring case neighbor sneezes walking by. Idk ever go back normal didnt know btw, PUBG first usermade custom gamemode Arma 3. common sense. Virus mutates time eventually effect kids severely. Right contagious strain effects children lethally per read. doesn’t mean don’t spread disease. one become spreader even get vaccine. Asymptomatic spreader. That’s wearing mask fully vaccinated recommended. per maderma website. know downvoted, valid concern virus still know lot about.

This good news need info doubts justified position. Sure perfect enemy good caution needed. think that’s fair. Worldometers shows us 400,000 already. friend California whose experiencing lung failure past months. bunch tests stayed hospital observation days still idea what's causing it. best guess exposed covid sometime December 2019 mild symptoms nobody thought anything cold. 

At beginning 2020 working long shifts mask going 20 mile hikes mountains problem all. medical leave bearly anything without running breath. pretty much sleeps day standing long completely exhausts her.

So yeah, covid one done kind thing. shit stays you. Note: soap work. Dish soap may remove anti-glare coating. Japan hardcore kind stuff. probably coming. last long don’t know risk. scientific information isn’t clear risk children would completely unrestricted impact virus, particularly around long-term cardiovascular health. can’t say children low risk, don’t know. may lower risk death. know certain cleveland clinic hospital (not main campus) 4 nurses administering vaccines ENTIRE STAFF, one came another hospital help.

Thats hospitals refusing use overtime administrators, mostly doctors themselves, come help out. fuckin KARMA right   put well thought guideline elsewhere post. tier-1 plan developed people actually competent science healthcare.  newest wave caused additional 20% Americans gotten virus. That's going end pandemic 2 months earlier predicted. original predictions back normal August we're looking June. looking June herd we're looking April herd. Pandemic largely terms deaths Easter ? possible PCR test might pick dead viral fragments (which possible post-recovery), odds tested positive, likely actually virus capable spreading it.

Correct. That's would really, really important know amplification cycle sample tested positive.

Information lacking comes what's threshold labs use determine sample positive not. information Italian labs practice 32 40.

Using 25 cycles amplification leads misleading results comes answering question ""is whatever genetic material looking here"". Hence news goats, papayas, ice cream testing positive.

If test positive 15 cycles like 99% likely infected. test positive 30, could be, could not. would interesting amount amplification cycles sample tested positive along actual yes/no answer. nuts. trained since mid March. gym shut mid Summer opened back (I'm pretty sure health regulations) see Facebook pictures every day mats packed everyone training like nothing ever happened. driving crazy. It’s obviously something anticipated didn’t. need start verifying residency. article English .com, Japanese .jp domain. No, think have. know blood work times ER told good. think checking infections (cell counts etc..) though. 

I really know go deal point. I've seen 7 different doctors ER since started. Spoke doctor least many times (if more) via telephone. I've spoken doctors walk clinics via telephone also. 

Everyone keeps telling thing. covid. allergies. No, fungal infection. No, stress anxiety. I'm literally wits end here. Specialists see symptoms. keep saying covid even though told I've tested negative twice going almost year now.

I know can't suffer like much longer. literally destroying me, physically mentally. Thats biggest concern, pro athlete cycling **is life** disease took away would absolutely devastated idk would able handle that, would like love life ripped away me.

Even today thinking would really like visit thrift shop street, think potential exposed, hear stories like (That also heard back March/April) scares straight back shelter place much handle

Just months vaccine makes worth it, CLOSE current restrictions, yes.

When throw doors open Rt 2 3 higher B117 variant, long fill hospital beds younger healthier people.

June July opening? Sure. Mid March hit 100M shots performed Biden administration? (Yes, easily exceed 100M 100 days) No. 24/7? Nice

My cost $12,000 month died. Must nice rich. 

Save retirement, it’s expensive touche' Yes safest way sucks still puts us risk. imagine hill gonna die despite knowing impact could future

like ffs, Japan even already culture masks fashion whatnot before. people still refuse wear stubborn reason. People spreading fake news comes incident

Moneycontrol incredibly clickbaited title

I think least articles expressing what's actually happening proper titles neccesity.

But would disagree moderation team.

At end sub dude, PlayerUnknown started custom gamemode made Arma 3 making standalone game. yes, pubg really Arma 3 thing concept wasnt born there, wasnt claiming anyway. get decent benefit many people covid recovered last like 2 months least decent herd immunity slow surge Manaus dealing kind case explosion due variant Tell Eddie Bravo, Ryan Gordon rest BJJ elite still think pandemic kind joke. Truly genius one field complete idiot everything else. Ha ha Ty, people made beanie babies, actually make super legit fabric mask metal part nose, never fogs sunglasses also looks like little unicorn living lower half face. 

I’d like they’re nice Mardi Gras next month. ton college students don’t seem care still go drinking partying. Maybe start slapping felony public endangerment charges people knowingly, they'll stop? NYD St. Patricks day really big drinking holiday

Superbowl part think minor erosion culture pressure society trimmed japan, china korea children, students employees messed society. Americans worse many aspects.   
These excuses call nations stupid society systems. whole thread nothing anecdotal evidence know what's good need take EU penalty. enough infections herd immunity subset people go matter bad gets.

This thought last spike decline, surprised latest spike 4 times size. I'm hoping correct time. ancedotal experience, knew 3 people going get vaccinated immediately b.c want first. yet, 1 already vaccinated two getting them.

I think 50-50. think see lot people opt slowly, fine me. want want now. Absolutely nothing authoritarianism, least Japan/South Korea's cases - democratic, East Asian countries. know anything Japan, Japanese collectivism goes deep culture (the result living tiny, population-dense country thousands years, well East Asian philosophical tradition, continual peer pressure abide societal norms). probably goes South Korea, though done much research there. South Korea democratic Westernized. Japan democratic Westernized (its government modeled British system, constitution rewritten US post-WW2). 

As far theory goes people abiding collectivism they're afraid disobey government mandates, well... pandemic, countries far stricter anti-COVID measures Japan - Japanese criticized government's inaction inability enact strict mandates pandemic (the government constitutionally allowed mandate enforce strict lockdown). referred Japan's ""invisible lockdown."" 


TL;Dr: Japanese/South Korean governments democratic. least Japan's case, government especially weak certain cases like these. Collectivism require authoritarianism maintain. Administration even look us. prevents students asking help? far, government President Donald Trump delivered 31 million doses two vaccines across America. 12 million – 39% – used. regions understanding travel region trying contain virus things? restaurants, bars, etc. fully open then.

You buy extra month live events everything else open. Cuomo, Newsome, Biden, Trump, DeSantis etc. would probably first tell know basically everything packed live events fully open then.

They know much damage done restaurant entertainment industry, still largely place recover. Losing 2 summers? kill everything stimulus save that. true approach question much nuanced nice departure rest thread.

It certainly effects, question many post covid strokes directly tied covid though hard determine without major study.

Stress, lack physical activity, stress eating, lack attention medical issues fear covid, sedintism etc... effects pandemic definitely cause increase strokes directly caused covid, indirectly social changes.

We expect see increases cancers, Heart disease things like strokes due indirect effects pandemic.

So consider reality consider people's health without previous covid infection. Regarding efficacy one shot, Pfizer Moderna’s vaccines 90% effective one dose, two weeks. efficacy still impressive one shot. Question is, long immunity last without second dose. 🤞🏻🙏🏻 - we’ve seen mask studies say wearing one protects wearer (if wearer doesn’t it) people around (if wearer it). disease spread respiratory droplets, means coughing sneezing result spraying droplets (and potentially disease it) everywhere.

No mask nose? Something gives nose tickle? Boom - sneeze spread disease like aren’t even wearing mask. makes whole thing useless. police? Again. aren’t apologizing giving vaccines. apologizing process gave them.

They trying give transparency situation.

Honestly, apology applauded. hospital systems US would never this. 

To me, hospital shows genuinely cares community it’s community views it.

I agree though, act giving vaccines shouldn’t apologized for.  think large resolved soon. fact infection rate high right terms actual time getting herd immunity probably going big factor slow vaccine rollout 1 million people getting virus everyday. issue unnecessary deaths rollout. every million unnecessary cases, 4,000 deaths.  inspired hunger games Long term symptoms happen lot different viruses really. seeing huge portion population people start kind take seriously. people told 'its head'. go competitive athlete basically paralyzed fed thru IV everyone (docs including) think psychosomatic 'lazy' wonder much due Manaus P1 variant. Americans even bigger problems anyone unable wear mask properly mental health issues body choice! good know! Really, no. Statistical insignificance argued, like 3000 Americans tiny percentage, 400k “only” comparable heart disease cancer. sure country survive, devil details.

The way democracy works fourth estate reports issue like vials thrown away. public debate demands change. State governments already responded adding 65 categories mix loosening standards. still needs expanded essential worker phone lists general public wish texted. continue articles people yelling see change.

Local governments hear reports adjust policy (somewhat slowly), need keep reminding them. That’s articles still relevant. God can’t stand “if it’s time it’s time” line thinking.

There’s old joke goes something like this:

The weather station confirmed category 5 hurricane going make landfall next week. government issued warning residents evacuate safety. man watching news refused leave saying “if god wants leave, he’ll send sign”.

The hurricane hits causing massive destruction. last neighbors leaning, tell “leave you’ll die!” man replies “if god wants leave, he’ll give sign!”

After storm proper passes, area flooded. man retreat roof escape flood waters. boat comes tells man “quick, get on, house washed away soon!” man says “if god wants leave, he’ll give sign”.

Well, eventually, foundation house washed away collapses man still roof. falls water drowns. Unable understand time, man gets heaven goes ask God let die.

God looks says “I sent 3 signs. could dumbass want?!” wife travel Los Angeles US, High Risk Category. people 60 lmao simple plan roll vaccine. based science takes politics this. copy-paste follow.

From NYT today,

Although rigorous study yet analyzed whether vaccinated people spread virus, would surprising did. “If example vaccine widespread clinical use selective effect — prevents disease infection — can’t think one!” Dr. Paul Sax Harvard written New England Journal Medicine. (And, no, exclamation points common medical journals.) Twitter, Dr. Monica Gandhi University California, San Francisco, argued: “Please assured SAFE vaccine matters — disease spreading.” uh... free all/elimination modes existed games long then... chance go Vietnam two years ago, lovely country. seem rely lot tourism though, least that’s nice locals met told me. Wonder they’re now. likely small surge winter. probably deadly moderate flu season guess. Hope I'm right am, expected go campus weeks exams, one wearing masks. think managed live 40+ like that, mother must still take care him.

If not, would suicided train forest long time ago.  state requires 24 day isolation, wasn’t told state department anything haven’t left house since positive test result don’t plan to.  post US *AT ALL*?

No, somehow US brought up. Hence it’s obnoxious. I’m fortunate live rural area, going outdoors, completely away people option us take advantage of, nearly everyday No, apology necessary opinion. Forcing apologies like harmful vaccine system. Israel leading world vaccine rollout. grabbing Uber delivery drivers street give excess doses. 

Having apologize wasting doses ridiculous. fueled jealousy concern greater good. Give doses, apologize trying save lives. IT! Agree. I’d even argue Memorial pretty darn important well, needs normal, close it. Arguably anybody 60. no, im guy commented saying going say harsh without giving warning read gave multiple warnings

what think “was say” original comment means? Well, implies found comment instead reading it. see spread around lot, unfortunately, said misleading.

While possible PCR test might pick dead viral fragments (which possible post-recovery), odds tested positive, likely actually virus capable spreading it. There's strong correlation live virus isolated stronger positive result. mean, I'll accept since averages across board.

I speaking anecdotal observations favorite team, Dodgers: Kenley Jansen COVID inconsistent year yet. Gavin Lux never really ramped up, hand AJ Pollock great year.

So I'm probably talking ass. people realize unbelievably stupid look dicknosing masks? understand negates entire point wearing masks? Relative means nothing comes high probability death governmental failures.  Regardless live collectively, clearly read issues handling pandemic charge managing pandemic. Debating countries supposedly better worse constructive issue problems average person Reddit cannot control. lot ""fucking up"" occurring way many counties. pandemic spiraled control manner has.. like world several test runs get ready SARS-CoV-2. real issue. I'm glad said this. understand there's long history doctors ignoring symptoms, especially women BIPOC, telling mental health issue. anxiety weird things bodies, we're seeing unprecedented anxiety depression result pandemic. anecdotal, fairly confident COVID yet lot symptoms ""long-haulers"" talking about: occasional fast heartbeat/dizziness, inability focus like used to, brain fogs, headaches, dry throat, fatigue. moments totally freaks out, history anxiety depression family intellectually recognize that's I'm experiencing. I'm surprised one gathering actual data though....have people never positive test fill questionnaire test antibodies see significant difference symptoms. Actually Google search present many news articles. presented one. presented many websites saying claims like false. keep saying there's articles hard actually link them. are. Still seen single link you. copy paste function malfunctioning, friend? Sad.  leftovers give absolutely anyone can. let single dose spoil. means hospital administers group college students, fine whatever.

The phase framework good, totally fine vaccinate anyone get there.

I know Cuyahoga county extra doses vaccinating first responders called prosecutor's office told start coming doses wasted. apologize understand, say vaccinated people instead thrown leftover vaccines out.

W.T.F.

That's stupid. Well risen 10.6% would called ""alarming spike"" so...  joke dumb wear mask properly today 2021. nothing wrong nobody intelligent shares different opinion. posting literal article guy allowed take test widespread opinion. wrong you? Maybe. It’s got behind variants do. study warranted get 3 doses? ::mind-blown:: probably surge fall surge pretty much overshadowed everything else.

Probably they've wearing masks since covid. Yup, I'm obese know obese people would vaccinated be. Stupid rewarding someone shit life decisions.

I don’t see eight fewer hours sleep get night works that, but, yes, access whenever. 

Of course, ephemeral compared fact you’re still pushing blatantly false information calling things would kill people. 1:4 ratios vented patients totally frightening. scary. experienced ER nurse think could handle well. since early November infected; still cant smell taste proper. lost 20 lbs since then. Honestly I’m good photoshop, idc vaccination certificates fuck around virus damage heart.

 late friend mine 40's. again, accuse lab escape man made virus huge accuse China. level accuse, accuser needs provide concrete evidence. evidence cannot something like ""lack evidence proving thing impossible"" conjectures ""wuhan happen research lab"". 

If evidence prove lab escape directly, becomes conspiracy theory. rogue country make diplomatic policy based conspiracy theory (e.g invading Iraq)

Trump evidence. probably implied FBI fake evidence China FBI budge. tiny little evidence, could brought uo already. Ditto, POTS months getting mono mid 20s. I'm early 30s still want mess around weird side effects COVID. Heh, Tersias119 slow day. 

LOL they're right this?

Have ever heard story boy cried wolf? Bc freedom comes responsibility, want none that.

That's basis social contract, even really taught schools. Excluding today, it’s unreasonable think could happen give last week ~800k day.  Imagine getting covid BC UR essential/expendable. That's me. 100% this. Also, announcement 100M DOSES 100 days, like 50 million PEOPLE.

I want critic sidelines, nearly fast enough. targeting 70-80% population vaccinated May death toll way higher anyone us never locked Fucking a, hoping live long life, right back ya. Japan doesn’t get “free pass” anything, get endless criticism white millennials think know country actually Agreed. though waiting effective vaccine available distributed everyone wants it. waiting that, know waiting for. Public health officials constantly moving goalposts major messaging issue throughout pandemic contributed distrust we're seeing. nothing come except inhaler nothing. Thanks kind wishes. We're nearly 1 year pandemic hundreds studies proving masks help. live rock? article:

Afterall, unlike US, China [\# 1 best prepared health /s Played Minor. Yeah, problem is: small segment folks ""absolutely to"" use daycare, daycares reach critical mass necessary actually exist. become exorbitantly expensive wealthy. 

Even daycare raising tuition around 20% (and already paying almost $2K per kid) still maybe 2/3 original capacity-- they're big. can't imagine small family-run daycare could operate like (and cannot.)

We're equipped society manage this. 2 years we're going another disaster (mostly aimed women) massive daycare shortage let half shutter. crushing. 

So instead shaming people using daycare lament fact live society that's isolated design allow better solutions first place? Germany gyms closed guys rolling garage. ok heard participants several groups...

I miss much - start rolling vaccinated! That's professor mine law professor public health expert saying. surge actually helped least 3 months immunity buy time, may lifetime, everyone know got COVID get vaccine anyway make sure.

That Memorial day mark even people like Cuomo, Newsome, Biden kinda hinted know abandon basically COVID measures, looks reasonable.

I know Aunt Uncle seen anyone besides one daughter person since march planning extravagant easter celebrate seeing everyone together again. They'll vaccinated couple weeks  Yes. hospital system state collapse weeks now. young born massive economic cost policy protect old, whereas pensioners assets protected record market highs.

Not vaccinating young point would another slap face. cost, none benefits. Checking say right, irresponsibly wrong. Feel way recreational cyclist, literally life makes happy, idk would handle losing Free NJ vaccine!\*+

\*$999 admin fee, due second shot administered.

\+Void prohibited, oh add sales tax also help reduce vaccine resistance. Many friends college care protecting higher-risk people done part mask wearing social distancing, wondered point getting vaccine would doesn’t prevent transmission.  Would happy banned traveling states exchange? kind office? sounds horrible  Pandemic - infectious disease spread across multiple continents. SARS-CoV-1 this. say 22 year old higher risk 62 year old.

But things equal someone smokes greater risk someone doesn't. smoking-induced illnesses aside, lungs shit like tar, certainly going help reduce lung capacity. already speed (1M per day) think that's massive lowballing What's wrong you? super smart guy everyone sharing opinion dumb? Google fasting covid smell etc. Read helped ago. Maybe smth  Still single source news article you. Sad. aren’t sure. (I wanna say top head) 17 new mutations, 3 significance. It’s considered new linage old virus, UK, SA B lineage. know Brazil’s numbers started dropping summer November. spiked even worse before. thought city Manaus 44% infected previously, provided immunity it’s looking way.

Restrictions started dropping significantly well November, returning back normal. Sound familiar everyone keeps spouting West right now? video. local hills setting records. book lift tickets advance! October ski shops selling equipment. wonder anti-mask people realize flu mild, also airborne. see mask wearing shame, like crippled ""embarrassing"". (I got made fun life disability believe shame wear braces, wheelchair, condition.) People fearful judgement follows. They'd rather risk crippling pulmonary fibrosis give Covid others ""look like dork."" 

rant - People grocery stores, bus, crowded situations... learned wear mask yet.

This guy told many times. year now. There's excuse. People severely ill conditions manage fine wearing mask.

edit - words. Correct. Thats 10 days boyfriend’s isolation + two week quarantine. people that’s livelihood depends open? say government step take care them, it’s evident that’s happening even first world nations   read article, registration required. get though, Pfizer Moderna said vaccines adjusted fairly quickly deal variations, help anyone already got vaccine. given negative reactions hearing about, seems unlikely people line get injected without data another shot affect them.  US English speaking country world now? Lmao  here!

I got ridiculously sick past January, remember waking one day whole body sore, like finished triatholon followed 3 agonizing days bed followed couple weeks feeling great

It felt like way flu, didnt telltale signs Covid either besides faucet nose, extremely sore throat body

Could ask getting flu helped protect againts covid? honestly feel like gotten live, take every reasonable precaution somehow protected ""flu"" got January would make sense Plot twist.

You go get shot @ MVC...

...actually even remotely surprised really happened.

::facepalm:: Yeah started February feels like eternity. Can't wait get back live life. currently around million shots day US, 15 million given far. We're looking middle end Feb. hit 50 million first doses, offer full protection. doesn’t. professor gave take home exams hard shit couldn’t even google (theory finite automata) kids would post questions Chegg got answers way. 

The professor obviously easily find though since material difficult kids would use steps solve problem Chegg answer. know details, speculation could've got delivery guy. methods good! rich countries vaccinate younger people older adults poor countries still received it.

At least US, young people vaccinated. state 65 plus sometime late march (at current rate). go severe health problems, take another 60 days. get people 60 may june current rate! wonder Covid-19 actually prepared us much worse virus future.

10 years new coronavirus hits that's even deadlier impact younger people, mRNA vaccines common place vaccine developed approved couple months, mass produce billions doses weeks instead 1-2 years. use actually lot, isn’t good prose. 

You also project most. New Zealand outbreak problem. written people self centered focused likely die covid. Touching stuff carrying people probably negligible source spread pandemic. I’m Pfizer I’m doctor, scientific perspective last scenario described doesn’t seem possible. 

In general though, answer question I’d imagine doesn’t make much difference efficacy wise I've read PCR tests still detect novel strains covid like UK strain. also case rapid antigen test? iced lemonades life savers! Failure wear masks correctly considered assault. putting lives others risk sick selfish bullshit. Nah Australia right thing currently. they're losing badly vaccination Olympics would soon end regretting it.  isn’t wealth, it’s called, again, “working public health”, alongside extremely talented public administrators, doctors, epidemiologists, call point, work daily *this exact topic*. 

I wouldn’t confident assertions reading comprehension poor seems be. Except we're seeing spike healthcare needs even accounting comorbidities. fake news talk actual hospitalization rates consequences. Also, people comordities. priority getting everyone vaccinated. Allergy not, lesser problem people allergies arent immuned covid19. Maybe, come stay pay taxes allowed leave.  biden need wants achieve 100m vaccinated 100 days joke kinda fell flat. 2023 - Sorry people hospital flu. Time lockdowns! Jk, hope. Some
People social. exam? Depends much revised. Canadian version

  much cut budget manipulate voters thinking private Healthcare better?

Western Canada wonderful. even at, like, 60% population hypothetically antivaxxers would impacting rollout early stage. time distribution issues think  Dude she’s 89 needed full time nursing care. Get fucked go bother someone else. best listening reddit comes EU. 

Feverishly pro-EU.  Amazing! 11 vs 4 &lt;70 vs respectively. That's similar seen spanish influenza. Every news article either focuses on
-variants!!!! ominous counter variants come attack city 
-vaccines going stop transmission all!!!

And wonder people pessimistic Fucking brilliant. Shots fired might right. lot times japanese language leaves pronouns inferred. maybe he. Could referred ""test taker"" never used pronoun after. Idk translate without taking century can't say clear gender. sure getting downvoted, that’s pretty reasonable gripe. It’s neigh impossible imagine something like getting publicity....

But unconfirmed speculation new Varient gets out, small study suggesting certain type antibody wanes... you’ll see dominate news cycle.  J&amp;J made decision 2-dose trial started single dose trial. announced starting recruit 2-dose trial, thought new decision, original press release single dose trial end September. would making decisions based phase data animal studies, information would far exact. Well salaries rise shortage willing workers. remember discussions couple months ago peeople posting here, plan resume normal life vaccinated (so basically around spring summer). events recent weeks emergence new strains uncertainty long vaccine-immunity last, still plan it? normal life mean things like visiting grandparents parents, scared work meet clients, partying, going dates new partners going movie theaters.  Japan unique issues. Mental health crisis plagues entire planet. much global problem needs fixed global scale. think shame due mental health exists Japan strongly encourage look outside bubble.

Japan work culture equally bad countries well think working ungodly amounts overtime ok America, Japan? tech sector plagued overworking, undercompensating, burning employees. Again, global problem needs fixed global scale. care initial lock followed rules. state partially opened I've going out/hitting gy. everyday since June I'm accustomed to. lockdown=I'm going also traveling states also open. Staying home way live life. Thanks info. Last read, months ago, 9 days absolute longest could live home freezer temps, course things still changing even much time. Plus, upright freezer colder refrigerator freezer. Looks like we’re adding another step process :/ Luckily it’s typically ice cream can’t easily transfer. 

In past, would wipe ice cream container wrap plastic wrap. bought huge 18-inch roll restaurant supply store 2 years ago $12 still half full. article fluff.

Give fucking break! college women's basketball loses money across board, handful teams make profit year, even questionable. salary relevant comment, bc subsidized. also, like comment, objective truth. want mad, mad sports fans watch women's sports. watch sports, period, quarrel me. Utah also ranks 4th states quality healthcare, I'm sure combination younger population, also fit, solid healthcare system Chinese University also say nearly third suffer three symptoms 
 Imbalances gut bacteria linked severity disease, cause concern 40 per cent population suffers condition shorter term, no. longer term, yes.

The higher price greater incentive Pfizer/Moderna/Johnson/AstraZeneca move heaven earth make doses. best way ensure enough supply keep price artificially low (and look happened EU tried that: manufacturers went everyone paying first).  God, shithole country. forties japan still passing uni entrance exams seems lot people shame it. wonder much played locking bathroom.

I'm speaking third hand experience. ""hard""? No, ""ethically dubious""? Yes. would really easy vaccinate dozen people, weeks second dose purposefully infect them, swab regularly see they're producing virions.

Issue is, matter unlikely is, there's chance someone get ill infection, hard justify could wait population level data start popping (look towards israel - they're 25% vaccinated.) That’s thing do. bought cage things around $1000usd it’s garage suuuuure makes hard lift it’s freezing below. love going gym much, either way. go pretty late night aren’t many people. miss neighbors staring lunges driveway haha

Glad hear good setup! dislike Reddit makes cesspool

Well nearly elected pedophile Senate. So. Y'know there's that. Lol sub mainstream media consistently pushed doom timeline every step way  upset auto mod keeps deleting rude comments lmfao schools told parents, pupils staff family members live roof must quarantine week. Mayors Edegem Kontich confirmed source infection people travelled Christmas holiday stuck rules concerning quarantine return.  

I suppose implying shame invoked western countries ""correct"" Japan exempt self-righteous shame. 

If could rewrite original comment would probably appeal people hold Japan accountable national perspective, individual perspective. 

I agree think western countries, especially United States, still pretty bad regarding labor laws, LGBT rights, mental health. 

Though, core frustration regarding Japan's human right abuses still stands.  Farsi better Hebrew... see anything article indicates anything projections opinions based antibody levels. I'm sure significant news confirming secondary transmission suppressed. think works like that. People getting reinfected. Antibodies last \~3 months. infected -- many people know haven't, either. word ""most"" applies here.  Lol dude seems like troll copypasta. 2022? ain’t happening Stupid Asia, among elderly general many old-timers still strong belief traditional, outdated information era

But tone piece mocks people regardless travel. extent tone deaf. Thank :) states that. New Mexico think New Jersey.

Which been. fact, federal could distributed vaccine group percentages instead population percentages. ""Norway Finds Direct Link Elderly Deaths Vaccine""  Please, start US understand need face mask cover nose living oklahoma makes appreciate masks worn ATLEAST mouth. really don’t get Americans’ distaste masks.

Polo G solid isnt essential. still 14 day quarantine correct clear answer. incomplete information made estimates - decisions - based data. possible J&amp;J executives miscalculated vaccine effective (or less) felt time. statistics properly account confounding variables. say people admitted Covid related issues, compare population demographics.

It sucks, borders closing reason another always possibility. risk comes loved ones country.  cringe Paywall. difficult say. stopped asking take it.

Hopeless.  place like Reddit believes persons future destroyed didn’t cover nose mask work home order everything online, possibly. lot schools actually mandate download software tracks eye movements ensure cheating.

And meanwhile I'm calling office demanding lyme tests symptoms tests coming clear refusing insinuating head. Good Lord, lady. Here's handy dandy media translator. western news organization says something ""on brink"" saying months, already totally fucked. west never admit failure. somewhat handy needle, add wire cloth mask. used fairly thick soldering lead wire.

Good man adult. understanding toward kids who’s masks never fit properly slide (even kids sized ones) Oh man get lucky. I’m glad wasn’t bad family better! health care workers whose job deal Corona patients can't get tested I'm sure lot elite get tested show positive. Thanks. hope right. direct evidence far generally viruses type titer get certain point block transmission based many antibodies even really get symptomatically. measles 10 times dose need block symptoms. u/FredoSosa history nearly-round-the-clock disinformation posts: blocked banned r/coronavirus trolling. Report ignore. He's used it. younger people don’t fill hospital beds nearly much. [The CDC’s data 18-29-year-olds, instance, hospitalized 20% rate 65-74-year-olds know get enough real N95s wear 40 hours week toss recommended? That's largely semantics. practical purposes, everyone stops giving shit, pandemic going factor vast majority people. 

Also, i'm going feel bad 4 months we're averaging 400 deaths day they're anti-vaxxers. personally would avoid talking finally get vaccinated give honest description vaccinated like express appreciation it. 

i would time - ""well, great..."" try break conditioning even little, without getting debate vaccines like general.

Glad got resolved? lie say say know? end?  remember going ""Mardi Gras"" party college upstate NY back '06 lots beads, none girls ended showing boobs. honestly good thing, whole boobs beads concept pretty damn sexist. factors? Free education? able play sports love?

Also, would athletes angry colleges getting rid sports budget issues they’re exploited? want someone tell things ok, vaccine 100% work, things go back normal determined date.

That's life works, going work.

They tell democracy can't tell bad things fear losing positions. think everything gets hyped goal post keeps moving?

I tell leaders tell you. 

1. Things go back normal 2021. even remotely ""semblance normal"".
2. Masks necessary way 2021 part 2022.
3. Social distancing necessary past 2021 2022.
4. Limited group gatherings necessary past 2021 2022.

If vaccinate 60-70% population 2021, mid end 2022, lose masks increase gathering sizes.

IF things can't done, perpetual state whatever right now. faster this, work end prolonging process.

And rebel, prolong process, kill someone, kill virus. virus specifically likes people rebel spreads virus.

Our leaders tell us could cost elections. fear. fear horrid news tied inability fix it. 

I'm Singapore longer US; zero 1 infection per day. still masks, still social distance, recently allowed gatherings 8 people. Everywhere go, track trace; mostly back normal. took entire year absolute discipline get still diligent it.

If America wants go back normal, going disciplined extended period time; entire year +. yesterday, US [was vaccinating 900,000 people per last week, number continually increased daily. Hardly sitting stockpiles.

I agree distrust thing, do? CDC decided clever half-truths spirit lying like make pandemic easier manage them. 

Not sure 40% figure. sounds like stretch. Japan (and much Asia) meritocratic comes university entrance. kinds standardized tests hold great deal weight compared US. Asia college placement much important career path Western nations. Internships hiring big firms much rigid lot gatekeeping based grades, test scores university reputation.  That's fair, better cautious. This. help, need advocacy wazoo Fuck man hope so... idea read it?

I'm scientist, hopefully nothing blatantly wrong study.  that's going problem. tourism wont thing, that's pretty good amount GDP. happened partial herd immunity. older people got virus made bulk hospitalizations. younger people got August October range. Pandemic largely upper Midwest think 2 weeks recover lolol No. Stop it. We're year pandemic first thought feel sorry person wearing mask properly? millions deaths year long quarantine enough figure cover face, punished. arrogance selfishness literally killing people. wait ancestors start appearing dreams expressing disappointment. okay Human rights relatively new concept. really founded anything concrete. 

Let ask this. feel Japanese government authoritarian actively denying citizens human rights? Yeah, no. 

You wrong, vehemently disagree you. 

You either support LGBT rights, them. real easy hand wave oppression away ""culture"" real people suffering said oppression around world. 

What said intellectually lazy, immoral, indicates apathy others hide guise respecting culture. *very* begining articles suggesting wearing masks home people could WFH isolate.

In world people living in. It’s thanksgiving movie. Start holiday season bang. move single goalpost. really deep. Like real. thing guarantee actually studied trials.

It's actually slightly opposite, kinda.

The time jabs minimum 21 days, according immunology dogma. great comment /r/COVID19 three weeks optimal wait time, optimal minimum wait time. Optimal time generate maximum immunity probably longer, know much longer yet.  wait longer, well, then, takes longer, right? goal  get everyone acceptable level immunity quickly possible. kids necessarily fine. 

They'd probably likely harmed car drive McDonalds would Covid, according stats facts.

Outside extreme anomaly, they'd fine. risk low worth considering, least terms health. S.O. health care worker high risk group. first dose, I'm really really hoping gets second well.  guys think reach 2 million vaccinations daily average? so, guys expecting it? Well exactly, country EU sort power say, usually power measured economic power EU relations.
Also EU ""threatens"" mentions sanctions, specially country like Portugal really much government do. Remember jury still whether current vaccines provide sterilizing immunity. hasn’t meaningfully determined either way. people like would rather 2% vaccines go waste even 0.1% go ""undeserving"" I'm confused...what age it? 100-day milestone largely dependent federal distribution vaccines, PPE testing equipment, yeah, it’s incredibly critical. Tell it. I've got rare neurological condition, three years ago put new treatment - told unlikely work, harm try. mixed results decided cease treatment. That's things went shit... instead receiving help, got fucking run around; referrals mental health seen adverse reactions people. 

Thank fuck random GP decided run extensive blood test, show low B-12. idea happened, whether linked treatment, not... completely lost faith specialists ability think 'out side box'. Anything unusual neatly filed away psychosomatic... Sadly remember that. living Japan time. Fucking tragic. Yup, hence That’s say trapped home parents year good thing, either, course. evidence author can't get virus vaccinated? evidence author can't transmit it? I'm sorry, there's enough evidence trust denier. somebody good sources, please show them. ?  “many areas US”, think mostly mean SoCal. far worst U.S. time.  countries going face problem world starts open again,

Uh, no, participating world reopening. dropping 2 3 weeks He’s idiot. Don’t listen him. He’s scared trying convince things aren’t bad are.  That's implied all. want discuss I'd happy to.  course, mental health issues still asshole. Poor guy, getting downvoted saying like is. Anyone calling Japan's measures ""forceful"" clearly absolutely clue *whatsoever* talking about, conflating hearsay Asian countries relatively slow spread early phases pandemic ""must taking serious measures"".

It's complete disaster. Measures laxer pretty much first world country (excepting completely eliminated virus like NZ, obviously), adherence government recommendation ""okay"", recommendations been, put mildly, garbage -- including running campaigns actively paying people go vacation prefectures eat (what actual *FUCK* thinking). despite ""low"" case numbers, hospitals actually pretty dire straits, far, *far* worse direct numerical comparison countries may suggest (the reason aforementioned campaign finally got cancelled, second state emergency finally declared) get ample deliveries. get 3 day batches. 

Honestly idea you’re talking stop trying, you’re honestly making fool yourself.

You’re aware hub right? They’re mass vaccination centers. isn’t even processing largest daily amounts compared London ones One biggest lessons we've learned pandemic across board, institutions totally paralyzed anything ordinary. shocking, really, triumph institutional logic common sense. They’re avoiding legislative lockdowns can’t them. Violates constitutional freedom movement stipulations government kinda limited “please don’t go late” “please close bar early” requests. He's smoking ideology allows hate people feel justified. Yes? change statement factually wrong was. Yep. 10 days past first shot Pfizer Moderna probably safely begin altering behavior keep mind going able fully alter one week second dose. case j&amp;j end getting one really need wait 4 6 weeks shot go back normal. far, 

it's ""this one few, team leave ER doctor suggests give remaining doses vulnerable patients nonhospital employees. team refuses, saying would violate hospital policy state guidelines.

&amp;#x200B;

SOME places use COMMON SENSE.

&amp;#x200B;

**After freezer filled Covid-19 vaccines broke, California hospital scrambled administer 800 doses 2 main focus make sure got every single vaccine every arm.** reached county public health officer informed situation collaborative approach, able administer **830 vaccines matter two hours,"" Howe said.** I'm considerably relaxed redditors - washing produce trashing packaging, disinfecting hands -, luxury Covid numbers never risen 200/100k, two weeks November. Right we're hovering around 100 town, vast majority time numbers low people barely discussed it. think summer 15/100k? 

Masks still absolutely required public transport shops, there's fines non-compliance, vast, vast majority people accepting compliant make fuss, feel generally safe. delivery service use mandates masks gloves employees, plus social distance, generally receive glowing reviews around, lot trust them. Another reason tip well, top incredibly grateful they're putting danger to. he’s anti-masker dick 🤷 not? Safe enough everyone distances wears masks - uhh, wait... under-educated goat shepherds consider goat herding race noble profession.  
You make goat cheese worry big words us city-slickers use.  people social distancing disagree reaction believe justified people giving situation pass. Many people different experiences virus. Mine quite horrible. addition, we're racing mutations get people vaccinated. terrified ever. thing mutates even deadly vaccine work, world could crumble. need treat like important thing ever lives, collective history, etc.  I'll wait hospitalizations deaths drop significantly go back ""normal"" life. assumption happen next months I'll back normal I'm vaccinated. we’d strict covid would hardly pandemic first place. haven't. tested October possibly exposed negative. I'm lot. work office one person go grocery shopping every two weeks. Food made home order delivery. share people took coronavirus test received positive result also fallen slightly, 16.5% Monday 14%. Officials say dip could sign infections starting fall post-holiday surge.

I went get covid test scheduled appointment. Testing canceled staffing issues site. 

So tests four people waiting line. wonder widespread test site staffing issues (if people working sites testing positive stay home), contributing lower positive cases reported. Exactly. People act like scientists forgot variants creating vaccine now, they’re like “shit, forgot that”. Deaths lag cases, they're gonna keep increasing even infections slow line people get now, wasting doses silly. Vaccinations need move private sector everywhere much faster. 

They every year. fast efficiently. 

When take over, vaccination numbers skyrocket. Again, that’s choice business. 

I pushing scenario push right past grocery worker asking wear mask demanding business you. That’s works. Wasn’t UK supposed start challenge trials month? Granted, enough dealing current moment, really hoping would going ahead since would giving us answer desperately need... Yeah, don’t tell “you know this.” scientist novel virus so, no... don’t “know this.” 

Less harmful less lethal mean harmful lethal. kids wear appropriate safety gear activities ride car seats, etc etc I’m gonna say “oh well, you’ll probably fine” comes novel virus. I’ll keep kids safe best make sure don’t get virus also get vaccine make decisions children.

Edit: duplicate word literally soldiers pandemic. Godspeed, heroes! many reversals goal post moving public health message became blur. deserve gold confusing me. wearing masks worst aspect, constant social distancing? Valerie Val Verde likely infect small number people. going major major problem totally misunderstood everything said I’m honestly inclined debate. Everything said true, 1. mask laws go cops probably going trespass you, 2. OP appeared insinuate planned keep going own, would probably get fired.

If private business thinks keep masks going laws drop public large ends mask usage, face 2 scenarios 1. one fucking listens business kicking everyone walks one wears mask (which would happen) and/or 2. might well close doors aren’t doctors office hospital one go keep trespassing people

Edit: OP clarified mask policy ends store says does, end almost simultaneously end mask mandates, therefore issue going big problem world. US minimal issue. Enough people vaccinated vulnerable time becomes predominant strain March contribute faster end pandemic point. Instead done June we're probably looking done possibly even mid-March. France ranks among worst world terms ""vaccine Sounds like homeless man. didnt job get to? Likely going happen we'll see. enough supply get people vaccine summer unlikely happen I’m exactly known optimist around unless specifically proven immunity current variants caused surge we’re dealing protect new variants, don’t think automatically assume strains able reinfect everyone already COVID-19.

It’s possible, concerned it, understand right it’s foregone conclusion happen.  hundreds thousands variants, tens thousands known back March 2020. media hyping variants like they’re new, unpredicted catastrophic thing scientists knew along designed vaccines defeat them. know - jumping cheap joke. 

That said, don’t think anyone thought vaccine 2020 impossible, optimistic possible timeline. hyperbolic guy makes statements as, “It’ll miraculously gone Easter” weighed in, didn’t really hold opinion high regard. They're less 1% who've gotten vaccine right going while. Probably 20 30% people need get vaccine things open ....

AztraZeneca needs approved.

regular freezer temps.

THREE HUNDRED MILLION doses ordered US.

they factories world make vast quantities.

and cheap. $4.

&amp;#x200B;

ppl talk single dose J&amp;J.. but

they provide 70M. “Says US”(we know saying man gonna less 48 hours) meanwhile, US pissing wind. No, American website primarily American users. topic hand, coronavirus, exclusive Japan. Reading comprehension kinda hard huh.. Well think hit nail head. meaningfulness ""percent positive"" metric depends test population selected many tests done. really representative testing would random, almost none is. Every test population selected biased way, people choose get tested self-select, sometimes test certain populations like nursing homes prisons. Even testing people grocery store random selecting people willing leave houses. Testing tends go holidays bad news cyclical.

They also found test area fewer positive results find, high number positive results sometimes interpreted mean done enough testing area.

Consider extreme example test 5000 people per day average one day whatever reason test 25 people. report percentage one data point could hugely skew results.

So know really meaningful people grab onto results desperate single number watch. 538 good article would feel sad inconsiderate asshole doesn’t wear mask properly indoors. Jesus Yeah usually people infected means deaths. Phx/AZ 
Basically ended restrictions May so. 
These people Mingling Non Domicile bubbles entire Time. honestly bad tbh. means fall holiday season 2021 fairly normal.  next gig United States GOP Senator now! Hm interesting, know Spanish flu. feels counterintuitive, suppose reason found eventually. totally agree wasting single drop vaccine crime humanity. 

Considering opposite side issue though, would probably open door rampant corruption allow anyone ""waste"" doses ""throw away"" taking bribes allow people cut line. 

Just like work McDonald's accidentally ""drop"" apple pie give friend free. would say Germany one better countries get help mental health problems. experience anedoctal, far everybody got appointments therapist 6 months. course long time, pay anything yourself. Also places get immediate help, can't talk them. think schedules roughly similar.

MMR normally given years apart, someone get small child catching later, given 4 weeks apart.

I looked NHS recommended vaccination schedule appears ""6-in-1"" shot given infants 4-week interval first two doses. (This covers tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, Hib, HepB, polio.) Rotavirus given 4-week interval, too. comparison, here's CDC's recommended schedule US, there's 2-month typical interval (but things, 4-week *minimum* interval) typical schedule stuff infants: 

A 4-week minimum interval first second doses vaccine uncommon. could waiting longer early covid vaccines would fine, though, data. worse rational person feared, think. thought would bad, expected quick, nasty burn over. dragged *ooooooooooon* long, I'm done (not ""I'm going something stupid"" way, I'm really tired staying fuck inside).  “Poor dude” doesn’t give fuck anyone else’s physical Health, fuck mental health. Buncha people making excuses inconsiderate asshole topic everyone NZ vaccinated, not?

There's issue kids vaccinated, typically interact tourists... maybe okay? I’m hoping progress end April. mental health break planned, really worry mental issues spiraling cancel. BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union countries kicked debate Monday whether people received COVID-19 vaccine greater freedom travel summer immunized. also societal stress politics whole past 4 years, people 12 (rightfully not, mental health affected, we've seen last 4 years). literally is?

Oh wait America yep fucked.  Eradication isn’t gonna happen. isn’t. Things favor of: lying. Ignoring science. Got it. That's works. BigPharma wants get large contracts, sell directly consumers. profit margin higher them. Right wrong, that's handled we'd quickly see far fewer doses available US. soon pick exponentially, promise like country then..? Perfect example personal choice/risk acceptance. Everyone metrics timelines ready reemerge. seem understand private business is. grocery store refuse service, label trespasser, ask police remove you. 

Why think right go business want money? efficacy numbers reported either 7 14 days second jab true numbers. data shows protection even kick day 12 Pfizer. positive result day 21 (date second Pfizer shot) surprising.

You can't take interim results claim full picture. claiming vaccine judged half even administered, much less given proper time build immunity body.

To head argument. fully believe treat unvaccinated 7 14 days second dose -whatever companies based data on. typo.

But personally remember Trump said there'd vaccine 2020 everyone called liar.  Nice thx info  smart enough wear mask properly... fuck bull get horns. actually though. know affects many others know. wear one work headache everyday come home. asthma isnt absurdly severe either. nebulizer times bad others. dont know everybody wants pretend otherwise. breathe nose mouth anyway. What's difference? droplets expelled mouth covered able breath fresh, unobstructed oxygen. people different. like ones born penis set breasts. 2021 thought trying inclusive accepting kinds.
Idk tests referring to. Maybe ones conducted hospitals saturated oxygen? tired sub’s optimist today, someone explain south african variant escaping antibody neutralization dumb thing worry (because I’m sure is) are, 18 days in, Rt 0 new cases hospitalizations end January is, least now, looking lot brighter start it. Honestly, even spike holiday bad expected be.

I'm sticking positive outlook laid month ago. February especially looking positive. :)  every English article .com suffix warrants looping US discussion. 

Got it. Thanks clarifying that. Makes sense. Hong Kong getting bad. live area called ""New Territories"" quite suburban / rural, I'd say 25% people wearing masks. Today shopping mall people place either without masks advertising intellectual issues mask chin, etc.

It infuriating. appears enforcement, one seems care. people think wearing mask sort silly ritual we're supposed follow actually mean anything.

I know half population average intelligence (...!) surely pandemic people try think little? That's thinking. Thank you! tried calling around earlier, lot closed right MLK Day. deaths hospitalizations plunge vulnerable vaccinated everything Fauci says suggestion. people know didn’t anything like crazy, masked socially distanced barbecues sure hell aren’t summer. reasonable context, known meant we've proved legal lockdowns worth effective. 

It's either open weld people's doors shut. someone chronic neurological condition cure causes lot pain, weird watching healthy people get really sick long-term. sad... scary need new problems. wonder actually timing shots given takes awhile make antibodies matter many shots get. think base trials two weeks second shot one week second shot. may takes longer build titers.

The single dose j&amp;j vaccine seems take two months reach high levels effectiveness. okay one month going significantly better one half two months mark. wholly consistent get tired Incompetent teacher bullshit. friend teacher right now: bending backwards students- anything help. 

Also fun fact: mediocre self needed tutoring 2011. regular math. teacher fine needed help. lower grades dad helped math too- common. isn’t student teachers fault. thought Tom Hanks already it. going define mean ""in classical sense.""

It's attenuated inactive virus viral particles, that's necessary definition vaccine, then, no, not.

But required vaccine something inject (or otherwise introduce body) activates immune system provides protection future infection. Then, yes, vaccine. ????

By logic shut area whenever positive case flu identified. COVID 80-90% vaccinated, becomes dangerous flu (if less given expected efficacy COVID vaccine). Believe think remember hearing that.

WHO team China serving quarantine speak. team went presumably yet ready. 

China understandably cautious entire anglosphere made known intention investigate China, virus origins. Oh damn. get base vaccine sequence specific cancer make custom treatment. It'll custom since legwork done outrageously expensive. probably still shouldn't. still got tartar shit control guess would almost people already virus.

This pretty foolish thing guess based nothing. never should’ve become political. away sports universities. Problem solves. Education returns selling point. Potential ruin averted. at-risk population 65+ health conditions small % that, something like 12-15% overall population 40-50 million. vaccinated, hospitalizations fatalities fall 80%+. Why? Like... social thing actually afraid virus still? Right, suggesting lockdowns continue event positive case *regardless* many people vaccinated. is, definition, rejecting return normality. I'd speculate athletes greater risk

It's disease attacks weak immune systems, fat muscle. speculation seriously off. reason one main symptoms lose smell, that’s virus gain access brain - attacks enters olfactory nerves.

It also causes inflammation brain, even induce aneurisms some. develop fear water? think it’s fine stick bullshit headlines articles clicks say “oh read article!!” clearly knew people would think meant 1 8 cases. You’re part problem. shitty Getting vaccines distributed getting people vaccinated takes loooong time.

[It's article August, preliminary found virus trigger episodes myocarditis. half cases resolve themselves, others cause rhythm issues CHF. Whats worrying asymptomatic patients noticing issues too.

NYC: 27,000 people per square mile. population density could vaccinate cities within weeks.

But cities share doses parts country.

I think US actually bad. at-risk population 40 50 million people we're 1/3 way that. sufficient supply think could vaccinate twice fast now. Yes people double citizenship makes sense. 1 8 hospital admitted covid patients like 100 years old. shreds. Oh make angry. I've angry incompetent government since beginning pandemic. three months prepare virus arrive Mexico, government learn anything countries. president never used (or recommended) mask. even said ""being honest"" protects Covid.

Thank you. never feeling better. general tendency western media shit portray India backward ass coutry never anything right. sadly, good number Indians well search call ""white validation"". 60% numbers coming from. 

When comes reality, quite understandable would infections identified. Specially bigger cities people live small spaces due affordibility. 

However, India experience things mass scale. many decades done countrywide vaccination drives simultaneously day. 
So may wait days test, case India. Except initial couple months still scrambling scale production, getting test issue. 50$ so, actually order test home, technicians local lab actually come home collect samples. ecomony scale comes in.
So honestly, reason believe actual numbers far officially identified.  sounds like transferring specious dietary remedy treatment wholly unrelated virus based heresay. common highly transmissible disease wide array short term long term symptoms?

How unified set symptoms now. weird one year still mystery disease. NJ governor makes teachers go back school won’t get vaccine, please vocal Antiscience crowd. Unfortunately, it’s almost always social issue.

I’m slightly hopeful healthcare year. We’ll see goes. literally say personal risk tolerance. want go party unvaccinated get sick. think social distancing closures mostly gone sometime May.

Masks, worry, stick around year I'm thinking public among paranoid people there. Well, yeah. Chris looks older, much shorter period: COVID. selecting group mortality rate 40x national average trying say entire country dealing kind selection bias? Ah,the benefits socialized health care system .

When US every learn. Appreciate sharing situation hope treatment goes well can! risk likelihood impact.

If someone overweight may harder time covid. guaranteed risk factor increased. smoking anything else exacerbate it. Good news mRNA vaccine soo coach keeps messaging me, like week “when coming back bro”. DAMN MAN WONT DIE.

I feel MMA gym owners right really really do. even paid 3 months membership didn’t intend use. I’m going get choked get COVID. Well would assume hospitalized people elderly high morbidity already, what's excess death rate? Thought new information, upon reading article talking long haulers like myself, we've known 8 months now... 10.6% easily within margins error. 

Now Time Back Transmission Barriers like Lockdown, etc.

Hang tough Ohio, neighboring States accelerate, risk continuing exponential infections likely not. I’d also like add relapse doesn’t mean you’ll never sober. relapse *then get clean again.*

I see like yes, high likelihood relapsing journey sobriety. That’s doesn’t mean ever stop journey give up, means you’re absolutely going slip ups recover from. 

91% relapse rate doesn’t mean “91% people die opioids, give now”. means you’re probably going make mistakes, that’s death sentence. 

The person you’re replying massively misunderstood high relapse rate means relapse means general. Ah, we’ve found one famed roaches didn’t scatter TD banned.

It incredibly frustrating doctors know treat post covid. Especially help co-workers/ supervisors asking I'm faking ""milking it"" get comments ""other people got covid fine, come better?"" workplace also want reimburse covid related medication/ doctors appointment. I've light duty since July plus still sucks.

Either way, fact checking done write title/article.

It's quarantine center, hospital.

The government trust people stay home since allowed virus spread without getting tested weeks. 

The entire group infected villages going spend weeks new facility.  I’ve it. doses. 

It’s COVID vaccine meant. I’m currently eligible. like every damn thing Alex Azar done, eligible doesn’t mean it’s available state. Granted Italian rusty, seems like talking cities Italy burdened covid many times more.

The article also seems indicate overburdening long time frame covid been. total much fewer flu deaths year covid.

I'm failing see whatever happened back comparable what's happening course year. japan culture. teacher's superiors much blame teacher. went down, would There's big difference though. knew outbreak Victoria. February March know outbreak Canada middle month... Makes difference world.

if information need know actually virus fucked tens thousands cases really going get near zero unless China head World Health Organization says it’s “not right” **younger, healthier adults rich countries** get vaccinated COVID-19 **older people poorer countries.** 

The article young vs old country commenters seem think, developed world vaccinating healthy young people poorer countries vaccinate vulnerable. sure that. Victorian outbreak could got hand we'd situation Canada right now. Two months hard lockdown stopped virus tracks. Whether place enact restrictive lockdown another debate people place, Victoria showed works there.

A lot European lockdowns been, quite frankly, half-arsed. Thank you. sure saying I'm sorry, I'm still quarantining. 

Yes still quarantining. feel bad still go this. hard year everyone. Thats take exams Japan. seen Battle Royale? Oh. it’s social issue genetic one. :(

Thanks link provided I’m really sorry shitty health care system there. wish best road recovery. Ask test. refuse, make document refused test. see footage Asian countries covid, good chunk people already wear masks far covid 2021 year Linux vaccine. None actually read article based headline clickbait accurate all. 5 downvotes giving exact precise number headline reflect. Yeah different ways could used. Places like Vietnam used local lockdowns flight restrictions. Keep mind people admitted hospital first place it’s pretty safe assume comorbidities. diminish shitty Ness truth stuff relative.

The US already administered [over 14 million figures Thailand am, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, are- zero vaccines administered.

Australia even approved vaccine yet, expect end month.

14 million larger zero.

It's everyone US, no.

But larger zero. countries zero.

That's necessarily problem, IMO, epidemics also far control US.

But US ""rushing"" vaccination comparatively. 14m 42m doses administered globally. US alone, administered third global vaccine doses, 4% population.

That's faster vaccination schedule countries, also global average, relatively. know that's horrible hope school got sued. I'm really surprised teacher go jail. figured outdoor eating season NorthEast brewery Massachusetts amazing outdoor setup discovered weekend. giant gas-powered heaters whole patio. must 6-7 them. still chilly, comfortable weather. nice getting people safely really broke boring cycle.

California absolutely nuts outdoor dining. patio, probably would people come over. People need kind outlet ten full months get one mitigating risk, hang private.

I'll definitely going back Mighty Squirrel often careful were. need small piece normal back now.  mean, difficult thing enforce.

We either go full china weld people's doors shut, hope people good head shoulders make right decisions...

Maybe middle ground rather people right thing. hard? Get sleep! 1A getting vaccine simultaneously. here, running 60+ mpw last March got it. COVID common knowledge assumed weird version pneumonia got antibody test after. run couple weeks could manage ~20mpw, breathe right several months. 


It's better I'm still back normal, case relatively mild (in never really thought needed call 911). wish people would take seriously nightmare. Stay safe everyone. Apparently that's correct.

I held belief surface cell tissue could shed replaced seems body attempts adapt rather replace scar damaged cells.

Considering used around lot silica I'm thinking probably get checked... listen people say August whatever normality. going probably Easter part. shockingly good news Joe Biden lol validating experience completely horrifying. 
I mild symptoms assumed full recovery. Three months later oxygen hospital “covid related pneumonia”. 26 btw. 
So it’s validating, far one I’ve talked heard anything similar happening, people getting covid lasting months. I'm mind-reader, text reader, I'm pretty sure he's asking still quarantining. Yes study account fact marathon large gathering.

Let's hope he's talk action. feel least he's saying already backed personnel resources. 90% percentage people made antibodies. haven’t released data whether people became infected. 

To put context, Pfizer Moderna vaccines, 100% people made antibodies 95% protected infection. 90% people antibodies fairly disappointing. Yeah, go it. would argue differently... question proactive versus reactive. question many cases virus actually country government knew it...in case Australia believe ever higher 1% positivity rate even beginning testing. places like US New York 60% one point.

If someone stubs breaks toe test positive COVID they're going write COVID related hospitalization. little respect front line workers medical professionals know wtf they're doing. That'd like someone telling line work job right 20% time. think may right. already seeing new case numbers fall holiday spike, vaccines jabbed every day. continue local hotspots overall think numbers freefall here. Add J&amp;J shots we're cooking gas. now. Imagine possible mutations ignored treated people like flu.  Reddit given kids... vaccines typically less effective given elderly. Shingrix another recent gold standard, quite effective oldies. Inflicting lockdown people, telling right go outside open business make living want safe also considered selfish no? 

Unfortunately debates ethics lockdown heavily censored sub nobody really rational debate this. really see countries help countries country's healthcare system strained economy shambles. can't help someone who's drowning also drowning. Actually really want go Costa Rica since one friends lives there, last time checked flights area like 3000$ unfortunately :( imagine raising child 15 years killed 5 seconds behind ""should been"" *""The CDC reports 35% infected endure symptoms lasting beyond three weeks.""*

Just common sense honestly. Makes lot sense we’ve always told people literally make money stay sick. Numbers may actually low today completely Things turned better way that’s likely reversed. Especially estimates case undercount correct. undercount fact 5-8x, infection recoveries vaccinations, Ohio currently 33.56% 51.48% immune — figure rapidly rising people recover people get vaccinated. pity party open invite or..? figures shown almost one third recovered coronavirus patients re-admitted hospital within five months. one eight losing fight life. Inflammation based would NSAID work this? thing maybe like ibuprofen literally top class athlete healthiest shape end ICU slim chances 5 days. cousin entire family (wife three teenage daughters) caught months ago. attitude pretty much “well really way avoid girls going school playing sports.” I’m thinking, mean could gone one year playing JV volleyball suburb high school.... it’s unavoidable. guess it’s easier say someone kids works home seems like didn’t even consider keeping kids away kids.  They’re sorta trying police keep breaking up. come cases still high , 8th Jan 6300 cases, 15th Jan 5200

They surely 50% immunity overall mean Israeli Arabs Palestinians? Israeli Arabs receive vaccine like everyone else. There's actually massive push vaccinate them. ""Man food bland happened place?"" sub quite awful wished it'd stopped popping here. need get undercontrol! COVID not, sooner get BMI longer healthier live. Japan: this

Actually, cases people died car accidents, tested positive Covid19... Covid19 listed cause death. google it.

I'm Japan, people cannot tested Covid19 death... single payer healthcare lets government control information, yes? Good bad, that's fact. Google it. government dictates hospitals cannot do... far payment services. test waste money? conspiracy, per se. humans organizations motivated. Especially country rule oriented. 

The testing done uniformly. Look Germany Japan test differently. Also, within US wildly different. keyword 'cycles.' understand that, understand anything what's going on. First confirmed case Canada: Jan 27, first confirmed case Australia: Jan 25.

Bottom line: getting summer telling people fuck keep summer 2022 met widespread resistance. So. You’re worried pets? 

Has CDC published age stratified IFR pets yet? worries last summer thought people put 2021. are.

Toronto SARS-1 hit quarantined. waiting room someone later tested positive wheeled through. got phone calls every day police officer showed day four see make sure staying supposed to. pretty damned scary.

When Covid started cried husband didn’t know why. following novel viruses since SARS I’ve worried decade.

And it’s worse feared. one saying people hospitals aren’t patients. saying covid patient without hospital. go urgent care covid, also covid patient.

In case, article talking patients hospitalized, headline misleading. Uhh, many gyms small businesses ran owners would lose entire livelihood everybody canceled membership. Yes, covid awful, act simply easy gyms lock entire year. Yeah soft Japanese standards. husband works physician hospital rural area California less 50% Healthcare workers accepted vaccine (this back beginning hc vaccinated). offered vaccine told would absolutely taking anyone else. considered read article saying Newsom would revoke physician licenses allowing people cut line, refused.

For lots Americans, pandemic *still* real. know handful people who've hospitalized, zero dead, know two nurses work COVID wards insist pandemic restrictions excessive.

The pandemic pessimism entirely due vaccine existing, plans roll en masse existing, plans return normal suspiciously absent. Anyone GI issues? I've unexplained GERD/LPR symptoms seem come go doctor figure cause. Could related (or not) COVID That's scary. covid, mild. Experienced fatigue, loss olfactory senses, migraine. I'm gonna assume that's mild. itching?? itching! 

I Covid July food-poisoning-like symptoms went away month. Since December 1st, I've non stop headache (brain scan fine), I'm sweating even I'm cold, I'm itchy, occasionally get vertigo spells wicked tinnitus suddenly briefly feels sounds like movie flashbang. blood vessels eyes breaking. 

I came back positive elevated autoantibodies blood test day I'm waiting hear back GP neuro think next. 

Part hopes something else Covid related maybe they'll know might stop one day. switched back university gym one commercial gym wore masks distanced. least masks temperature check-ins mandatory everyone must get tested weekly allowed in. I’ve never seen someone wipe equipment either, even dumbbells. Plus positivity rate among students significantly lower rest state. y'all still mostly office again? Spooky scary Efficacy varies year, that's primarily flu mutates fast strain changed slightly time vaccine produced. bit guesswork, based prevalent strains months prior, total shot dark. flu shot also covers 3-4 strains every year, efficacy might low one them, might good another. media likes jump headlines like ""flu shot 60% effective"" rarely straight forward. Drs ""know"" Covid. said researchers still know long term health consequences. told many reports type happening. see comments post happening. I've tested everything. Cancer lupus gout, etc. happen healthy male overnight. bout m4a Exactly!

A mask sort magic corona-kryptonite, way *reduce* spread, completely prevent spread. 

All universities know testing home, program monitors computer webcam phone video app monitor angle. I've heard works fine *does* completely prevent spread test-takers test. English translation first large group migrants since borders reopened -- 6k 9k within 24 hour period entered Guatemala.

Reports 21 sought medical attention prompted testing. Guatemala declared State Prevention using military assist return followed proper procedure -- including providing negative COVID test. COVID rebound medical resources limited public health system.

English translation second article  agree completely. living eventually people stop listening Nah it’s pretty point. Sorry pressure justifiable. twiddling thumbs good vaccine available Look articles, that’s adequate. 1 am, wasn’t find perfection. 

There’s recent stuff. Funny hit Google, plenty more. Woah. happen November sounds exactly happened 7th grade. hospitalized day tonsil surgery unable move hip joint inflamed much, maxed legal amount morphine could give day, like 30mn. Eventually spread every joint body, hospitalized, bed ridden 3 months. Specialist doctors dumbfounded wrote juvenile arthritis. eventually went away painful experience scariest moment life. idea really happened went away... trust CDC top thing proactive... they're best figuring optimal way distribute vaccines minimize pain death, that's I'm going faith in. really hope numbers win this. Decided sort new sub today see kind articles getting posted. horrible mistake. 

It’s amazing people cling anything negative like gospel spout random nonsense. 

The difference thread rest sub charts. ""Having brain fog, like difficulty concentrating, shortness breath especially they're trying return workouts exercise regimen, overall lack energy.""

Save shortness breath (I ge itt run way much beyond capabilities) find scary 58 year old dude describes problematic, describes daily life 25 year old. WITHOUT COVID.

Boy glad paranoid sometimes. I'd probably get way worse got virus. China locking cities hundred detected cases, though, I'm sure they're really ""downplaying"". people **want** live like forever. Dystopian fantasy simulation. Probably. Flu way due mask social distancing, hospitals still overrun Covid alone it’s infectious dangerous. events even allowed Texas right now? didn’t shut place even though two Dancehall cited two violations city’s Emergency Health Declaration due large crowd concerts. dance hall one citation away closed down. sounds downright *dangerous* patients. What's done that? Ohio's neighbors actually falling faster rate Ohio: Indiana -29%, Michigan -21%, Kentucky -14%, West Virginia -25%, Pennsylvania -20%. 

The real problem states started high level even reductions there's still high prevalence virus community. easing preventative measures could easily reverse gains. matter investigative team already China?

Do really think China allow America investigate it?

We'll magically find WMD there. didn’t know bad back either. know one knew bad could long term assumed worst governed based that.  big wake call humanity. made realize really can’t depend people keep us alive. remember looking back end world zombie pandemic movies past thinking ridiculous is, easy would’ve save everyone, covid made realize people always act self interest self beliefs. 

Sometimes it’s fault it’s manipulation government, it’s still shocking ego big play humanity, really can’t depend people step matters. Like said pandemic, likely would worse situation truly believe unfortunately. Saskatchewan. numbers small coz population small, per capita numbers highest country. Yet conservative govt basically super lax lockdown rules. 
I've heard people organization talk they're happy numbers 300s versus numbers Ontario 3000-4000 range. really would like correct point even worth hassle. getting 300 400 cases day population 1/14th Ontario's looking around 5600 Ontario's population. would definitely freak people we're 300 actually matter think flu. 'Confusion' stockpile? 


They bold faced lies (nothing unusual administration-on-the-way-out) calling anything slap face US citizens.  


I'm repeating comments I've posted, truly feel bad Biden considering mess he's got try clean now. :( goes show care less people hating Israel. 

People already running wild claiming Israel refused vaccinate. No, people ever develop symptoms less likely spread virus. U/yaolilylu may better explanation. ""schools"" means masks, distancing, hygiene protocol. talking ""normal"". McDonalds ball pit 20 kids normal. kids anti vaxxers. sure works unless everyone accepts kids probably infected. Many ridiculous word context. saying hasn’t happened decided exactly many means.. 1/100 1/1000 1/1000000 could debated day. aren’t necessarily tests “prove” symptoms  AKA easier make everyone suffer till get shots proof shots.

But lbh masks burning come summer. [I quit healthcare told wear masks. EMS - Alberta. 

My employer absolved responsibility anyone got sick. “If get sick it’s wearing PPE incorrectly,” said management. management team couldn’t last 45 minute meeting without griping masks. 

The mask thing microcosm bigger issue, that’s management, lesser extent staff, don’t really give shit patients co-workers. simply collect pay cheque. co-workers worst plague rats, often first burn tax payer money going way shop first responders discounts. I’ve heard fake news sips Starbucks idling ambulance calls, ever hear sister’s nut job boyfriend. 

Since leaving realized needed way way around. I’ve seen job posted twice, can’t help cringe fact starting rate still hasn’t changed 5 years. new work home job immediately paid capped EMT. 

COVID great filter, friends work experience. Back COVID Jan running 1.5 mile 8:50, 2 miles sub 11, 4 miles probably around 24-25. dying 10:20 1.5 maybe 28:00 4 miles trying fix running it. still breathing issues running feel fast runner. Oh God, would fucking *riots* NYC half zealous enforcing mask etiquette. wish would NYPD break truncheons, tear gas, zip cuffs rioters. moved countries (US EU) last summer husband border security insanely strict thankful everyday able go feel like marriage would shit-load trouble. imagining stress puts panic. That's majority world going for. 

Aus NZ going strict eradication. information whether covid vaccine may effect long term effects? Like, time grace period finally experiencing effects? hope any. would suck ass vaccine help preventing next array symptoms. have. think people going country music concerts probably engaged risky behavior general disproportionately likely get already it.

I'm speaking individual person's case maybe terms numbers would infected event  fall, winter, 2022. Summer. time Q2 2021, masks going garbage.

But private businesses still require them? Mask least invasive defense Covid, anticipate businesses, especially large corporations, keep requiring cases diminish near entirely. write name Barbados offering 1 year visas people wanted work remotely there.  Israel population 9 million (same New Jersey) they've vaccinated 2.7 million people far. would assume that? Covid? Vaccinations “normal people” come October-September, take least beginning 2022 people stop wearing masks. doesn’t count incompetence psychology public trust returning.  US?  maybe i'm idiot. Please explain completely open country without getting getting fresh outbreak? Lesson learned Dude pets fine continuing uncertainty whether vaccines suppress infection rather give immunity another factor raised leaders’ debate next Thursday, sources said. Less lethal still spread virus easier less caution Quarantine snobs lmao dumb enough go concert right now, probably don’t realize people concert don’t take COVID seriously. FYI Japan front, things peachy may seemed last year. big surge cases recent weeks yet prefectures lax state emergency. No, bad US, Tokyo getting 1500-2000 cases daily, business people drinking buddies every night. Two reasons. First, lag. Second, new case levels decrease gradually vaccination brings R less 1; drop immediately. Sounds similar person eats 8 spiders sleep course year.  fuck would pessimistic? Every **day**, article 'group experts' Fauci SAGE saying masks social distancing potentially rolling winter lockdowns required long mass vaccination complete. harder vote get vaccine FL state pollution also god awful there. Something US actually better lot eastern countries at. disagree anything saying. kinda surprised one asking discussing approach fact kids completely exposed anti vaxxers wherever go. think takes build antibodies anything dosing intervals did! believe similar going have! incoming US administration's position pushing China thorough investigation origin covid?

When 36 made 45 million (likely closer 25 million taxes agent fees still) contract even including endorsements brand deals, think okay decision body holding up. “just flu” people annoying. flu also kill leave life long health problems. 

Viruses scary little buggers. get inside you, alter dna time never fully leave.  won’t able generate much money. Wow, comparing flu now? Alright then. fun, actually built something similar using parts hand plus $20 items.  Mine uses Hepa 13 filters! ha. stupid shit like still allowed sub. would say nuanced that. like give fuck personally impacts them, care needs. still kind fucked up, believe not, despite issues, better many companies. exactly easy find company puts employees else. company better job most, obviously perfect. Almost happened nursing license exam weeks ago. known better, dang hot hopped Bang! Either hospitals overwhelmed aren't. aren't, open up. needs start metric look at.  think situation different set people got virus first time. I've heard anecdotally Brazilian doctors 1% reinfections. dense area actually looking virus get herd need considerably 75% people get like 90 95 real random sero data Manaus. 

Just case along, contrary postings subreddit, we’re seeing scientific mystery Manaus virus somehow magically “broke through” immunity. 

This virus magic. perform miraculous acts. JFC well-established natural herd immunity exist. Please, stop repeating nonsense.[herd immunity ain't EMS resources already full time job do. going pay additional EMS resources? logistics world don’t make difference aren’t given funding implement them. state given $6 million total funding implement vaccination programs COVID. isn’t even enough fund all-volunteer operation lot irresponsible news media coverage. every state (regardless conservative) good proportion people (at least 20% state) look proportion local fellow citizens throwing caution wind say “ummm thanks, I’ll cautious”. 

If people emerge everything everywhere would ignite again.  places like South North Dakota wonder precipitous drop follows pseudo herd-like immunity (as reaching herd immunity among 40% population doesn’t give eff). 

My point may see places people lived without caution react vaccinations quicker people careful ones actually risk therefore first people eligible get vaccinated.  effect plug herd immunity hole first lead quick observable drops. even worn English schools colleges (except corridors high schools), students ‘grandma murderers’? outdoor bar near house. Normally nice business summer time shut winter. winter raking money one wants go indoor bar.

It looks fun going there. seemed rounded corner December, apparently holidays hit hard. US probably overly concerned. Enough people either gotten virus vaccine time becomes prevalent largely blocked. issue vaccine updated couple months people revaccinated needed. accept lower efficacy vaccine likely. no, 37 millennial think. classifications weird, current high school college kids gen z 4 answers this. It’s unlikely. doctor article says, would highly unlikely vaccine prevent disease also prevent infection. Without infection, transmission. Lots people don’t get that. It’s magic. 

That simply vaccines work. I’m sure scientists insist vaccine could possibly act vastly different other. think trend continue. people know see getting vaccine without issue, comfortable people become getting vaccine themselves. Utah young, healthy, best quality healthcare country, despite heavily religious state, LDS church cancelled services like 7 months, told members wear masks, follow local government regulations. I’m vaccinated please visit June Oklahoma, vaccinating 5k people week. current rate everyone state vaccinated 15 years. enough time though see point. live one states basically restrictions. want, although much sparingly...no bunker. international travel think going stunted years. We'll see. Probably best hope get trial kids going soon kids getting vaccines fall. think general thesis correct, think bears data yet. 5.3% South Dakota's population given least one dose, given vaccination accelerating, likely less half number reached 7-10 day point first dose. 

Moreover, noted, ton states seeing drops cases, even states well far vaccination goes. 

I think trend getting holidays individual behavior response hospitalization death counts increasing, rather vaccinations. 

I think start seeing effects vaccinations next month, though, mostly hospitalizations deaths. mature... complaint wasn’t reported U.S.‘s results. complaint tone article suggests U.S. uniquely (even apocalyptically) poor performance, compare death rate countries it’s clear case. yes what?

You’re honestly joke ahh gotcha. form medical information allowed - clinical studies? I'd actually like make case certain lifestyle choices help chances toward reducing damage viral infection you. obviously clinical proof COVID yet, really think tons preliminary evidence back suggestions. want people jump anything crazy, though, since studied depth. it'd level vitamin D, evidence say low inflammatory environment body suppress viral infection. course, think right sub even would directly coronaviruses. example, opinion article references, regarding diet:  Japan currently mass vaccinating mind blowing. think USA could host Olympics July (in theory) talk casually like that? terrible Logan paul, more. Since people employers required take tax money pay even see it, would difficult manage us.

It would fun see would happen, though. don't, still better surgical mask unmasked. So... low, zero, like person said. you’re confirming young people going die parents get vaccine. Please tell slightly exaggerated isn’t scientific study supports words smell come back going freak right NOW. 

It around long enough definitively say. People hear scientists report known issues think ""oh, that's all, that's bad"". actually talk long term issues *could* potentially - \*starting\* show up. There's enough potential there, IMO I'm avoiding everything non-essential get vaccine. Risking lives sat individual desk exam...seriously? No. provincial governments cutting funding Healthcare (it handled provincially.) Plus due view mental healthcare important physical healthcare. provincial governments cutting funding method convince voters privatization would better.  Brazil start vaccinating week? always wear mask outside house. Always.

I rarely outside house.

When outside, really stop clueless idiots coming within 6 feet safe zone (that fact safe) talking you. think weird moment launched several vaccines along came articles ""new strains"" excited finally drown haters “but masks 2023!!!” Crowd. Cheers  IDK baby throws rager every night approx 2am it’s v COVID safe yelling toys never supportive countries lol. Checking every day number cases number vaccines given.  I'm everything think need fact severe lockdown states basically problems Florida, except Florida body shots chick bar...what purpose restrictions? think vaccinations young excellent idea- younger people longer suffer side effects COVID

The young also tend drivers infection rates.

Younger people also ones looking us old people get sick.

Vaccinating young makes sense . I’ve heard smatterings also exist South Korea. Whats interesting Canada nasty Flu season 2013 hospitals reaching max capacity one said word... [Black Hair always threw off. Nobody concerned cost US. vaccines free charge pandemic status. insurance might charged administration fee covered insurance. J&amp;J heavily involved. America's ""leaders"" foolishly chose prioritize economy battling virus - trashed economy allowing virus spread.

Hard measures taken early things would different. It’s exciting doubt, wonder much 3 weeks past New Years holidays? People probably keen stay home already done traveling seen families. 

I’m still excited see vaccination numbers go up, don’t know correlate decling numbers vaccinations yet.  think it, think social distancing like artificial (and temporary) herd immunity. 80%+ population would stay home, virus would limited places could spread- similar would happen 80%+ population antibodies and/or vaccine.

So, said, think entirely likely 30-50% country either COVID vaccine (depending model ascribe to), decent percentage practicing fairly extreme social distancing (say, 30%), entirely likely *could* seeing possible reduction cases pockets society.

A lot big ifs, course, we're quickly marching point virus going harder harder spread simply we're running people infect.

Note: Everyone still need get vaccinated real herd immunity, obviously. We'd love go outside without masks like before. social distancing pocket stopped tomorrow case counts would likely explode again. I'm also assuming, course, social distancing measures work think does. Oh bad yeah accurate! US doesn't! 
 
Send man Mississippi! “Denier”? clarify, vaccines here. think worst move would release dangerous vaccine. focus EU getting things working without vaccine.

People made vaccines silver bullet saviour. happens not. six months new strain? get infra place. Something able soon year, even though \`third world\` (sarcasm) country like china get infra working 2-3 months. Perhaps successful relatively smaller populations smaller administration. states less successful don’t think means less oversight Publication date January 4 **2021** per article. Call 'early' wish. fair 2 nukes dropped them. Nuke pass. guess it’s like there’s road construction ahead signs start way early everyone gets traffic backed way needed. ppl jump right lane ppl think assholes doe waiting. reality many lanes closed ppl though line jumpers make traffic flow understanding can. vaccine prevent virus makes less severe. may mean less coughing etc. and/or less virus airways less transmissible, think they've quantified (and remember contagious symptoms maybe makes difference all). Yeah, actually set couple filters automatically removes lot Vitamin stuff. seeing is, believe not, way less would already automodding lot it. Report anything think removed also always welcome modmail us particular concern. Lol I'll take yes, good luck covid patients likely type people (old, multiple conditions) frequently hospitalized regardless

Agree. study also showed 1/8 readmitted patients died too. Suspect first wave, admitted sicker older - many aged care homes hit. Doubt stats would now. South African government warning re-infection due new strain: It’s good idea delay regular checkups. Dentists staff pretty well covered PPE I’d imagine it’s doctor. Many places let wait car, outside, it’s time seen. I’d recommend going. So, super careful this. live alone work home. go store week suuuuper early morning go basically nowhere else take daily walks. 

That said, point burden protection people can’t get vaccine going fall people. can’t reasonably expect entire world alter lives them. It’s sad, life isn’t fair.

But good thing vaccine widely available going go hand hand cases dropping. dude age 75. meaning **30** started rocking ""silver fox"" look back Season 1 Saturday Night Live  O:-) post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

A lot spots CA strict guidelines nearly year, destroyed small business economy, trending one worst COVID case wise, messing vaccination effort much red tape (had 10 months plan). Doesn’t help governor can’t obey basic guidelines. point, exactly Newsom bring table helping us? would vote hold accountable awful performance. Students UK colleges required wear masks sat settled class/exams. fail see value so? US vs. China

Two countries rather hope would shut stop ruining everything 10 months sub still trouble misleading title click baity bs.  recommend following Trevor Bedford Twitter. covers lot stuff. sure that. Germany tried apparently dropped order pf criticism EU officials saying would illegal Biden won, vaccine rolling out. news running ways pull people in. Variants existed while. Yeah, South African variant sounds bit concerning UK variants, good portion fear porn tune 5pm God dammit Canada Ummm no? weird. Manaus warning maybe wait bit longer start celebrating. It’s good everything ***PERFECT***!!!!!!!

Anything less perfection means you’re terrible person!!!!!! definitely need better plan. absence better plan let’s please let vaccines go waste likely get virus probably virus now. starting burn out. Cases declining deaths rising beat it. virus might something dealing w/ quite time not, forever. Progress we're getting manageable level day passes. tough may exposed people really, going concert environment I'm guessing even catch COVID probably can't sure got concert. People stuff way likely making risky decisions everyday. sucks I'm going feel bad anyone involved this. Similar AZ vaccine. work really well populations high numbers cases. Narcissists think know vaccines better thousands physicians scientists. percentage take 5-6 weeks die? lowered count 25% felt 25% due COVID, seems experts right did. protection rate 1,394 participants received doses either CoronaVac placebo three weeks apart nearly 70%, Sinovac spokesman said.

Sigh... like imaging parallel universe competent leadership. data source using shows excess deaths FL&lt;CA? 90% Australia vaccinated, hospitals overrun COVID. would be? decided ignore manufacturers recommendations 4 week 2nd vaccine (for immunology reasons) move 12 weeks. Also pay double eu member state paying they’ve fucked everything else badly. Theyre literally going vaccine creators saying said people might get 2nd jab good while. overblown propaganda shit ive seen people eating uk needs win Getting deaths, cases, hospitilizations safety rods place half battle.

Calling go full tilt open would commonly recognized pandemic over. I'm getting suggesting Australian international restrictions never ever relaxed regardless vaccine uptake, prevalence virus. 

By logic, regardless vaccine uptake, recorded case anywhere within Australia immediately prompt local shutdown try stamp out. absurd. They've given care  ""Small subgroup"" = nowhere near statistical significance vaccine trial, likely chance. acknowledge recently made error judgment.

Morons rarely acknowledge mistakes though.

Someone 2 states, could tell us making new ones though? Thats true read wrong petco parks 4000 day definitely 100. don’t think many denying value *some* conditions. It’s comical see inevitable claim cures every new condition comes along, especially claim comes self-confessed “smoke weed every day” type. little bit conflict interest there, isn’t there? probably helpful haven’t COVID. suffer joint inflammation point lost use one arm number months. Doctors weren’t helpful diagnosing inflammation. 

I cut sugar started eating tumeric smoothies. Within days pain better lots stretching mobility back arm would say it’s back 95% former self. 

To day eat sugar feel shoulder getting stiff sore. 

Anti inflammatory pills didn’t help. drastic diet change me. 

Hope find relief near future. pre-existing condition ""covid denial social media/being anti-masker.""

Cause sure can't wait spend life helping pay medical bills millions people made political enemy *and* purposefully exposed dangerous virus.

I mind paying normal person took precautions sabotaged crowd. gathering from? dont believe anything said would expect impact hospital system. decline quality life expected far seem much anything future strain system. That’s pretty good they’re acting sense urgency. still lot developed countries close centers weekends don’t seem hurry yet. Exploitation equal slave labor.

Anyone compares plight ncaa athlete slavery stupid dramatic completely removed reality situation.

It’s flawed system...some players exploited, many players able exploit system. regardless, it’s slavery. average person needs care political party. never become political. It’s cooties that’s political. Considering articles pulling rare cases sticking headlines real statistics, think clue many ""long haulers"" really many fully recover. Dolla bill dolla bill, pay rent chill. governors Saxony Thuringia **had September opposed efforts Merkel introduce restrictions** summer anticipation second wave COVID-19, acknowledge recently made error judgment.

Morons. That's drugs man plenty of. Look living. vaccine warning possibly killing frail, old people. favorite part people say cant live life fear constantly tell afraid health problems, losing job, money work 78 hour weeks tell can't afraid disease 2/3rds chance fucking rest life 1/3rd chance outright killing me. matter there's chance ok gamble lot people would rather take.   I’m 30s patiently waiting turn get vaccinated Florida nonresidents showing cut line incredibly frustrating. tbf half posts thread sound like guys getting older, became aware body lost sense taste smell bad sinus infection 3 years started come back everything smelled tasted different before. Certain things especially disgusting like cherry flavored things, fresh linen scents, peanut butter absolutely putrid. slowly surely went away things tasted back normal. 5-6 years ago I’m getting depth taste beyond salty/sweet/spicy. I’d say it’s recovered 85-90% 

I really really hope comes back even faster! reason felt like smelling vicks vaporub helped clear sinuses made sense smell taste stronger. Hope recover ASAP! imagine never lot pain you? severe pain can’t function, life, make suicidal. Crohn’s plus host shit opioids reason able function periods life. always responsible taking them, never issue. VAST VAST amount people prescribed pain meds exact experience me. exactly NZ right now. We're happy border closed. concerns whether quarantine system strong enough keep new variants. Tourism also booming Kiwis taking summer holidays NZ instead overseas. month-and-a half ago. 30 relatively healthy, “mild” symptoms. Like bad headcold lots headaches, fatigue, congestion, loss smell taste. Finally tested negative last week, took month initial diagnosis. But, get bouts horrid fatigue know “leftover” Covid bullshit. Also smell/taste back 85% varies day-to-day. Hopefully symptoms start going away new ones don’t begin appearing...be safe there. think that’s still faster average person, I’d doubt average American could break 14. sad nonetheless suspect Biden sworn in, right wing media outlets sudden ""care"" Coronavirus infection rates deaths. trial? bad response drug last represents 0.1% *known* confirmed cases. 1 1,000. use U.S. CDC's stat 1 8 cases known, number much smaller. flu first time ever got it. knocked ass days. got vaccine year learned lesson. Indeed, roughly feel it. realize people travel internationally reasons tourism right? Really hope speed quickly, rollout picking up, hope bit curve everyone!   Indefinite lockdown? don’t think anyone wants that. Temporary lockdown new cases pop up? Definitely. sound like me. tested multiple times, never positive, yet experience tight chest fatigue seemingly random since March.

Well, say random, however Engineer took time work out. 

If remove human contact, mean even spouses people live with, completely goes away. theory incredibly unlucky asymptomatic folks around me. limit possible contact outside office work, home partner.

Unfortunately seems contact anyone trace it, immune system goes crazy immediately kills (my chest flare within seconds near someone later discovered it). Unfortunately amount body trying kill fire stops getting back house, partner catch lingers house least week, period body constantly high alert, burn fire mode.

My best advice give follows: Ventilate shit wherever living, try correlate feeling crap **literally around**. immune system sounds like mine, powerful good.  US already contracts 5x many shots use, FYI. kind late say want pay them. black people problems covid? I’m asking many country, haven’t heard before. so, why? one location. entire country right? Funnily enough even see scene scientist actually said it, saw bit Klaatu/Keanu references scientist saying it. LOL. one weird coincidences. remember looking graph beginning December really believe guess. Projections worldometer links accurate almost scary tbh. No. Thats work absolutes percentages. number looking death per million, that's see rich country problem. country smaller population mean deserves exterminated, that's happen without vaccines. Peru first deaths per million months, right fifth europe another wave, Peru right beginning second wave, vaccines secured government yet.
Looking absolutes depend testing capacity population size terrible approach. I'm saying seek help, I'm saying acting like going magically better redditor bestowed stellar advice ""be careful pain meds"" ridiculous. Sorry hard truth likely prescribed first place mistreated doctor continues refill them. get dont many tools. However, promoting domestic tourism banning business travelers disallowing foreign residents visit home countries spitting face foreign residents pay taxes Japan. Check Google map images tourism spots (I looked Hakone recently). They're filled people pictures taken 2020.

The overwhelming feeling foreigners Japan (source, friend friends friend living japan) want push foreigners. Hmm... caught mono *bad* 20 years ago. worst, sleeping 20 hours/day (walking every 4 hours painkillers). 4 months caught mono, still sleeping 12+ hours/day.

I've ""always"" needed sleep alert adults... wonder could lingering mono symptoms. I'll look option.

I've never heard before. Yeah, wish updated data. However going one thing see long term studies done on. really hope much damage permanent, hope far minority. question logic, think airports pretty much COVID parties. understanding slave labor poor.

The system problems needs changing/improving regardless, system person choose school go, get level education, freedom quit desire time...is slave labor. It’s even close.

Comments like insult piss people continue exist slavery. related caravan, recently saw chart displaying level confidence vaccine several countries, much confidence varied depending produced. Rather curiously revealed people developing world trusting science general westerners. minor point, major point.

Many progressives try equate illegal immigration legal one. big difference allowing highly educated foreign workforce country opening country mass immigration third world countries. Floridians first read rules knew going happen. Gov. stupid either. obviously money grab get rich people come spend money. Thanks selling essential workers Gov DeSantis.

Nice, remember reading back (its Aug 31 last year). really would hoped/thought might better idea percentage people might going cardiac issues. 

Like likely 1% would pretty damn large lot smaller. Around Aug last year, seemed studies coming light heard whole lot it. America 24 million confirmed infections likely 60-80 million actual infections, I'd say incidence long term cardiac problems likely quite low would noticing lot happening say 10-20% patients. 

Guess know while. Pretty scary stuff nonetheless. I'm physio, used 45+ year old clients coming clinic I'm seeing clients ages 23-45 different complications -from joint pain neurological problems- getting infected virus. it’s pretty well known fact among cyclists

Yup, I’ll freely admit things planned even late April. won’t budge mutations gain dominance encountering defense, encountering defenseless. weak defense, add chances selected survive. Since defense everybody due vaccine, adds risk. Normal non-immunized people develop slightly different defenses, depending bodies detect foreign proteins. such, risk single mutation gains footing less.

Singapore longer US; zero 1 infection per day. still masks, still social distance, recently allowed gatherings 8 people.

I mean that's completely ridiculous. one infection day still can't live life. What's fucking point? What's end-game? Yes, millions doses vaccine

That’s secret. 

Some areas facing shortages, hubs however prioritised 

Again, I’m painting picture. stats speak themselves. I’m merely contradicting point stats made saying it’s definitely possible hubs perform local one. Also don’t work hub. us volunteers.

And brexit got bullshit argument, you’re really reaching now

Enjoy ignorant guess makes feel better, gave birth June stay hospital 4 days fine. Leading that, doctor every single week covid due high risk pregnancy. 

I've also gotten regular check up. 

You 100% go doctor annual dentist. Yeah, we're closer 0% 100% potential carriers I'm going assume everyone it. That's top level hysteria right there. Surge deaths follows surge cases Done here, something Good luck Egypt. like 20 million people grid something? That's told went. Yeah realized typed it... I'll keep downvotes inaccurate info. mRNA vaccines designed target component virus interfaces humans. part virus mutates vaccine induced antibodies can't deal it, unreasonable imagine may longer able easily interface humans. I'm saying there's risk variant resistant vaccines, people designing vaccines pretty smart it, planning around mutations thinking do. model shows cases already permanent decline Again, also poor results weren’t admitted hospital YEAH RIGHT. comes EU anything time, remain skeptical actually see it. meant 100 days masks, lockdown. irrational response announcement CDC recommendations; terribly surprising response someone deciding wear mask early on. slowness administration vaccines definitely problem. disagree problem quantity since far last report 20 million far available population 320 something million. getting straight answer administration much actually much available seems issue too. ""After last week""? happened last week? Paywall  papers analyzed first 5 months pandemic. 56.1% novel data ie opinion pieces. Zero really possible, goal. don’t know sure.

It’s much less dangerous. What? even come realize keep reach critical mass vaccinations economy collapse. 'surges' again, anywhere near worrisome numbers, need come jesus conversations regarding vaccine.

I say imply worst probably over. hurt you? Antibodies continuously present many illnesses. immune system memory &amp; B cells release antibodies body comes contact virus again. antibodies lingered system every existing virus, would detrimental overall functioning.  going change vaccines available last week seem likely 😩  Social media never predictive representative. comments social media meant anything governor right would actress little understanding state government worked. Good point. Got problem weed, got problem buddeh I'm Israeli, 25% population (Arabs Haredis) laws legal system, cops somertimes afraid enter territories, led ignoring covid lockdown. community spirit talking about? sounds like voice woman trying get CVS/Walgreen's arguing wanted buy ""personal"" products back April. clearly reading printed-out internet talking points. person, raised game, much.

Thanks clarification. Good her! think Japan actually going really hard time it. They're mostly relying Novavax recall correctly vaccine little bit Moderna. unless UK numbers look outstanding approve based that, see getting vaccine probably April May.in case Japan they're probably going lot protection fall winter 2021. good one bro lol totally agree still lax restrictions travel things. problems need dealt with. biggest issue source infection community spread. that's provincial problem. true, ocean vaccine meanwhile Irish struggling even thousand, even North Ireland part UK experiencing food shortages, one could argue hoarding scale choking supply chain Ireland could seen act war, right?

Even 20hr day still close one person per minute. process one patient point entry exit? possible vaccinate one person per minute possible keep supply vaccine? vaccine refrigerated right? military presence hub? patients enter building log in? even read wrote? gonna get vaccine time GP. ""infection rate"" would refer Rt. 30% sounds right since went increasing basically flat (pending kind bump early week sabbath slowdown), say change 1.20 0.95 something.

the best indication we'll days numbers stay flat keep going down. mean?? It’s mild flu! 

/s can’t tell. one apps installed phone that's supposed notify I'm risk something never gone off. think would work enough cases actually track compete data set, think either true. That’s I’m saying. Even vaccinations countries, it’s gonna long time herd immunity reached. Countries like Australia right thing looking citizens.  I’m sorry you, hope long term able return level near used be. Im 52 year old former athlete, basically leaving house get vax. people still stupid point? Fearmongering Soooo good thing curbstomped grunty old ass nearly killed me? Glad horrible shit good something. personally know many cases. husband's colleague get it, wife teen child did. think summer. bad cases. Wife checked out, things looked good.

Colleague's wife's HEART STOPPED days Christmas. Luckily, knew CPR. implanted defibrillator thing 10 year battery.

Holy fuck.  dunno seen details guess ""100"" thing catchy. Wear masks 100 days, 100 million people vaccinated 100 days, etc. sure mean everyone's first dose second dose what.

There tradition tracking new president first 100 days maybe comes from. 

Getting 100 million people doses within 100 days would progress I'd call ""ok"" point think pandemic would over. at-risk population 45-50 million people. protected think worst over.

If going set goals would prefer primary goal -- get 65+ health conditions second shots. done, hospitalizations fatalities fall 80-90% totally different ballgame. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article semblance SARS-1 never classified pandemic. 29 countries affected, diffusely (not, example, one entire continent like first second Black Plagues; every continent affected, South America completely unaffected Africa unaffected except one country). 8000 people globally ever infected SARS-CoV-1 virus, fewer half infected China alone Groundhog Day last year.

Just thought worth noting. SARS-1 anything close meets standards pandemic. world never going back normal 

1) Yes are. reason they’re funding COVID 2025 parts world won’t get vaccine couple years, meaning COVID big regional problem. 

2) Honestly, type comments helpful. You’re extrapolating “WEF funding Covid awhile” “nothing ever same.” swear sometimes folks don’t understand history. Polio didn’t go away month, neither COVID, literally vaccine right getting people’s arms. 

It’s like folks want us COVID land forever. See comment below. Also Vietnam, economy great one feels “isolated” literally everything open again. Please read Fibromyalgia.

But managed pull 3 years suffering. found worked me! Yay! 🤗 Jesus that's scary. Thanks insight!

Article continues  clarify: article says afraid go home. headline says afraid fly. Yet here’s mom arguing doesn’t want get vaccine entire family “for time being” wants see side effects she’s freaking guy city made news passing away 2 weeks taking vaccine she’s saying that’s proof vaccine killed him.

Yet she’s ignoring millions doses given everyone fine! major side-effects happening common thing would REPORTED everywhere! mind reads conspiracies online focuses one million cases reported sort proof it’s happening en mass, rather small isolated instances.

At one point argument like “no, don’t take vaccines corona virus, stuff take vaccines for.” Fucking insane, won’t even listen keep saying “you always disagree us don’t you?! won’t even listen consider say!” Well talk vaccine altering humans DNA, “massive fraud” occurred Biden winning presidency, Illuminati removing Trump power something Dominion voting machines used Venezuela “now it’s happening here” yeah, I’m going entertain bullshit. Yeah thats true, pack day smoker nails definitely yellowish tinge from?

I closely following Israel think they'll see positive developments soon. also serious lockdown. I'd love see conclusive data. I'll jog long goof whole time Definitely long term issues. I'm recovering readmitted due heart going crazy. initial ECG looked like heart attack A&amp;E, junior doctor used words 'heart attack.'

After echo, ECGs etc..., cardiologist established heart attack. Rather, Covid19 nastiness.

I'm 48, underlying conditions, doctors describe fit, prior Covid19 judo couple times week barely walk. I'm improving quickly random selection population, clear, specific long term damage. even know J&amp;J vaccine mRNA based fake news here. Doesn’t matter problem is, there’s always stoner claiming weed cure. Geeze I’m 58 after. Career since 1983 working oilfield wake symptoms everyday ( joints , aches pains ) shoulder surgery, knee replacements , need shoulder replacement .
Yes virus real others suffer daily things don’t complain post . wake everyday manage best can. that's.... episode office.? Sucks insuline resistant then, guess :/ Mount sinai entire wing dedicated LongHaulers, there's whole subreddit well. Might want check get 'facts' dr.facebook. know people renting AirBnB's VRBO's Florida places. Obviously risk drive travel family/pod everyone gets tested do-able. point rumor US going wrap keys toss bank steps media thrives clicks/views. Fear = eyeballs, sad true. kill CNN post running daily total US vaccination counts next case data, they? Nope Yeah honestly really sad situation many industries. $600/wk alone many jobs pay, $300-400 alone. qualify sort state level payout well - making much, more, would working. mention many people also get SNAP medicaid free top that. lost job possibly pays less 

In ideal world would clear message average person simply gets paid little - need much higher minimum also median wage. course corp America allow that, wait stimmies end let people work dirt pay. Aymeric Laporte used City's best defender. got Covid played that, looked absolutely fatigued every time played. Get defeatist nonsense. Wow sucks. Hope get called soon! East San Jose mostly Hispanic.

Welp, sure hope test negative loss smell nose taking PTO. Well extremely bad news. vaccine would still infected means even super mild non existent symptoms still run risk long term risks. liked thoroughly enjoyed art. make post it. People thought crazy suggest even mild symptoms would bite back ass months later. one things set last year avoid Covid much POSSIBLE. knows thing timebomb like 3 years. moral pandemic. Novel viruses never taken seriously. Feels bad innocent holy hell people still refuse think. People think 2020 bad. 2021 2022, looks it, finish 2020 infections didn't. kinds comments make feel better shitshow country?

I assure we're okay Australia need concerned us. production countries Swedish-British drugmaker partnership University Oxford plans produce 3 billion doses drug use established separate supply chains vaccine Europe, United States, China India. manufacturing agreements 10 service United States, vaccine produced Emergent BioSolutions Inc. Baltimore Europe, manufacturing distribution vaccine come Germany’s Merck KGaA Hamburg Darmstadt company Novasep produce vaccine active substance Lyon production operations carried Novasep's Belgian site China, AstraZeneca reached licensing deal Shenzhen-based firm BioKangtai. pact, BioKangtai exclusive rights China clinical development, production commercialization rights world's largest vaccine manufacturer, Serum Institute India, produce doses India also low-income Australia, Melbourne-based CSL biotech company responsible manufacturing AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine Australians.

This article says Emergent Biosolutions making J&amp;J vax USA well Oxford -  Explain not? personally tried everything coatings glasses, high quality masks. fix issue. 

Imagine every single breath creating fog entire field vision, pull nose out, it'll clear instantly. 

I try go anymore people like think I'm idiot nose occasion. legitimately cannot see. See comment: I'm saying vaccine programme done. I'm saying must continue done NZ, regardless finished elsewhere. NZ reaches 90% vaccination could open border. 

But also border closure done serious damage economy. House prices record highs, retail 2019, unemployment went 1% expected fall soon. excess deaths caused lockdowns, death rates fell time lows 2020, even suicides hit record lows. 

So see none issues complaining about. actual evidence NZ says elimination huge success. party promoted gained largest electoral victory NZ party since 1951, I'd say Kiwis largely agree that. also proud parents support puppy. help. No. That's true. multiple factors play relatively ""fast"":

\- Infinite money.

\- financial ruin efforts make working vaccine.

\- High incidence virus allowing fast completion trials.

\- Known ingredients effects.

Stop spreading disinformation. Closing businesses hurts Han short term income...  mean that. means data inconclusive research needed one way another. taking inconclusive result falsified result, shows incorrect understanding statistics.

Honestly, chance adverse effects extremely low, give potentially gather data?

The difficulty getting trials filled often means might wait decades ""conclusive,"" double blinded proof. Here's trial published 2020 enhancement paclitaxtel chemotherapy curcumin (n=150, first clinical study explore efficacy safety administering curcumin intravenously combination chemotherapy treatment cancer patients.

This pharmacological interaction known 2 decades, yeah, ""conclusive proof."" Sure help anyone got cancer meantime, though.   No. different international event. Anything requires people jet overseas bad event spreads disease heat-trapping gases. 9K confirmed cases could easily 50k actual cases. Even estimates untested cases 2x-3x confirmed tested. March/April/May like 10x. Also, need 'herd immunity' tangible effect R value, nothing thing.  really think stories like good public confidence. really think recent months strategy health officials like Fauchi make comments like ""well masks etc going away vaccine"" hurt things helped. Yes, want people get shot 2pm go whatever heck want 3pm. I've talked ot many people like point getting vaccine still stuff.

I wish could openly present timeline public. ""If get X number shots spread drops date this"". far case. keep wearing masks etc tell to. Texas 25% less testing per capita US whole miss bunch way, also counting probable covid deaths, unlike US drives US average suppresses Texas average depending look it, also Texas lower population density one would think helps significantly addition better average beds per capita 400.000 deaths days now. Well vaccine going disappointed get know countries things. Japan attitude mental health traditional japanese values. value stoicism, strength, self reliance (at least men). consider things like mental disorders weakness, shameful. homosexuality, that's whole different thing. Japan reasons opposing make sense many countries.

America private healthcare want make money. Medicine treated business. healthcare public would lose lot money, hospitals doctors would likely change way lot things (for instance, longer recommending unnecessary procedures doctors making extra money it. even enforce thing like that?  Got it, yeah guess concerned requisite defense systems primed ward long covid symptoms, seem happen even asymptomatic people. one report. reports included **non-hospitalized** patients found (varyingly) huge cohort people.

And also tend milder, previously healthy cases - *not* severe cases elderly already ill.

Stories people 20s, 30s, 40s either dying becoming long-term sick become common. Wear masks. worth risk. Johns Hopkins count, lists New York having 40,020 deaths Tuesday, followed by 30,989 California, 30,895 Texas and 23,227 Florida. countries using done emergency use approvals, meaning skipped normal approval steps thousands dying need get fast. 

What skip? Steps merged, done concurrently obviously governments pumping money personnel fast-tracking approval proof reduce spread NZ accept nothing zero cases reduced spread still problem us. 

This beyond comical. NZ never ever international travel that's requirement. Eh. One could certainly argue inequality contributed greatly present state, I’d say social/cultural issues keeping virus around. anti-intellectualism weren’t rampant, probably wouldn’t even need mandatory lockdowns mask orders. Inequality contribute prevalence anti-intellectualism, think lens better focused preventable deaths arise inadequate public health system. I'm Kiwi happily wait countries desperately need first knew story lol aware negligible spread is. dumbest comment could imagine. please tell me...why \*this pandemic\*, one \*you're\* living through, first one 200,000+ years necessitate us ""living new conditions""? mean increased funding public health resources like preventing pandemics, beefing healthcare access, etc., yeah sure. mean ""health"" equivalent TSA harassing us multiple times day rest human civilization, think anyone would OK that.  


You specific w/ mean, think vague actually nothing back up. Think demographics well, rich vs. poor.  richer are, even Covid, less contact many people, distinction widened Covid. Work home benefited top earners far bottom--you can't flip burger home.  Population density also comes play, see, worst hit areas CA also densest: painting broad stroke political belief, many factors stack southern california. suspect though conservatives lockdown helping throw straw camel's back however.

Great! speed vaccination process. comment heavily upvoted? I'm commenter... saying person selfish, arrogant participating act killing people why?? reply right person? Note: antibody binding studies factor memory cell immunity likely significantly affect immunity. Twitter link picture. vaccines likely still work variants. lot ""older"" people would another 20 years live covid alt reich everything could keep going mother us. hit 40's got NASTY case shingles. Thank you! Every news organization needs take second consider headline going cause someone get vaccine die spread Covid. 

This headline immediately make clear single batch vaccine made 10 people allergic reaction. make clear pausing vaccines one batch (which many would consider mistake allergic reactions nothing compared lives vaccine doses could save). make clear could PowerBall-odds fluke batch completely fine.

Maybe article does, people read article ones going look headline shared stupid facebook group decide get vaccine vaccinate kids peer pressure friend get vaccine. countries using done emergency use approvals, meaning skipped normal approval steps thousands dying need get fast. NZ community case virus since September emergency using normal cautious approval process. Also low list vaccine producers prioritizing countries outbreaks delivery. 

There proof reduce spread NZ accept nothing zero cases reduced spread still problem us. Yes herd immunity via vaccination stop virus, waiting for. history poor slow vaccine rollouts NZ, expected could take months, especially vaccine compulsory. get Type 1 lose beta cells overnight. Look honeymoon period Type 1's. still produce low levels insulin first overtime lose beta cells receive 100% injection.

My guess difficult tell point. people equally threatened flu since forever nobody stopped whole world that. that's nice all, i'm still gonna need wear masks, social distance, live miserable existence indefinitely. physically alive important actually *living*. know true happiest people persistent vegetative state. source: science! think people want see people get themselves. post removed cannot verify reliable source.

How worse? Kinda curious uses deodorant. Want body messed up? Use one chemicals! one making strawman argument either Wuhan-style lockdowns none all.

None 'facts' true either, Arizona currently worst state per capita infections: look silly here, time move let smarter people discuss things. kinda ironic Guardian posts U.K. still higher death rate per million?

Yeah know symptoms P1, look up.  probably see dentist masks smell like mold two days. wondering news home town would reach here!

Of things town gets news for... this. facepalm.jpg Good always choice democracy, that's kinda concept it. get majority people get side, nobody force lockdowns that. People insist perpetual lockdowns *after* vaccine program complete ones, point, promoting death economic destruction. people dying rate thousands per day. nobody dying fucking allergic reactions. lol what? I'm scientist perusing sub New trying calm people response sensationalist article titles. People panic virus wanted help calm folks down, that's all. confirm Florida. can’t wait move PNW.  ""Vaccines work virus like expect to."" - Basically also added people received doses vaccine likely become carriers virus spread due high level antibodies.  getting vaccine NZ least July.

This comical. still evidence vaccine provides sterilising immunity therefore possible vaccinated still become infected asymptomatic spread virus,

Yet everyone (or population vaccinated), matter.

And vaccines actually regarded diminishing viruses ability spread, can't demonstrated (except without deliberately infecting people).  Yeah... I've tried find things minimal risk like hikes drives, definitely feel push go hang friend's house. see plenty friends well. 

But I'm determined transmission environments thing over. Masks magic supply chain giving every citizen access legitimate respirators. Little Jimmy coughing dollar tree Spiderman mask, even wears perfectly, 100% getting people sick, idgaf anyone says. 

I'm trying use opportunity get touch nature (but mostly use opportunity play shit ton video games)

Hopefully vaccines, make sure point probably outright prevent infection, enough teacher getting vaccinated later month! excited. painful read this, we've watching happen slow motion every (mis)step way.

It's like looking back thinking ""man, we'd known.""
We known. We've shouting whole time getting completely disregarded people charge. Chinese Sinovac vaccin go similar rigorous transparant testing vaccins, so, similarly safe effective? rolled lot non-Western countries.  Undergrads, less. see ""normal"" on/off switch depending vaccine status. know many people probably treat way. me, see getting plane 2021. I'm also going hold maskless activities, like dining out, community spread way lower now. teach Massachusetts physical school buildings year district, districts vary. going vaccinated later month hope you’re right friend. would incredible Well getting vaccine NZ least July. still evidence vaccine provides sterilising immunity therefore possible vaccinated still become infected asymptomatic spread virus, keep border closed achieved full herd immunity via vaccination within NZ. quarantine system funded June 2022 last heard.  never ever Basically pandemic done May 1. suspect masks done July 4th. thank 95% effective vaccine otherwise looking late fall 2021 spring 2022 go back normal. don’t think adequately explain California, strict lockdown measures, epicenter virus. least, they’re better states haven’t locked all. goes everyone thought would happen. 

The reality don’t know virus seems spread way does. think it’s clear masks help. preventative measures help. it’s perfect science clear outcomes. Knowing America, there's chance he'd fired come in. There's reason COVID destroying country. entirely unequipped combat it, thanks criminal exploitation corporate overlords.  Spend tourist dollars somewhere else, place I’ve US really awesome Hawaii, nyc, San Fran, LA crowded shit hole Right now, I’m trying avoid conversation restrictions ending return normality family house. parents adopted zero risk mindset want whole family hunker years even Covid vaccine.

Pandemic done May 1. happen Giant military contracts motivation WW2 well. fair, lots people probably interpreted ""normal"" ""economic normal"" answering poll. may take upwards year. both. it’s mild cares. point vaccines keep people hospitals.

If vaccine still keep people protected enough stay hospital, protected enough avoid cough fever .... still met criteria go back normal. serious reinfection .... room hospitals. Right?   fact emphasize *liberal* NY times knew bullshit coming. issue viral infection 10 years ago, sense still aren’t 100% close. remembered perfume smelled like feet while. good Nah think forever things all, could see lasting bit longer distancing. thinking vaccine widespread rollout powers-that-be want get economy churning ASAP still cautious/testing waters. might start allowing bigger bigger events, initially require masks... become superspreader events, gradually walk back masks fall. two cents. recall Fauci saying couple months ago thinks fall, 2021, people able feel comfortable sitting maskless theater usually pretty conservative/manages expectations, hopefully bit earlier that. probably extent. Also enough people gotten it. Always remember news dumb makes money COVID without COVID. Anyone half brain field immunology virology knows transmissible variant expected likely lowering death rates, news won’t say anything that...

Also, experts believe become endemic coronavirus time. cold  Oregon Consulting Group faculty-supervised student group University Oregon. guess everyone else busy. follow logic. already decided schools reopening matter numbers say, would bother fake numbers too? Makes sense. bot? Jesus reported seems fair, although many gray areas regarding residency, making difficult judge.

I imagine people might taking enforce restrictions, whether legal not. It’s thing Arizona. People going concerts, indoor dining, getting haircuts, etc. state literally worst world people Arizona simply care. It’s really frightening. No. good reason. 

First off, demonstrated time masks induce clinically relevant decreases blood oxygen concentration increases blood carbon dioxide ).

But fine, let's run say masks increase CO2 levels. case, wearing mask would beneficial someone hyperventilating secondary anxiety.

The act hyperventilating reduces blood CO2, translates alkalinization blood. body like far away normal pH, disrupts normal metabolism. person perceives changes form anxiety, dizziness, tingling fingers, even chest pain. exacerbates initial anxiety.

That's one common home remedies panic attack breathe paper bag Rebreathing exhaled air increases amount CO2 bloodstream, normalizes blood pH alleviates symptoms.

So that, ask kindly piss ""intuitive"" anti-mask sentiments. Rule Brittania! country world report stats worse dirty, dirty foreigners lie cheat steal second place us.

If take Spain, even end second? Without europe's oldest population, despite early cases, despite worlds best national free point healthcare system, despite govt transition, despite worlds 5th largest economy, despite first world communications media, despite Trump Bolanaro, proud probably really, really like, maybe top ten killers population incompetence lack care?

La la land Saxony December couple days go supermarket. ridiculous many (30%) people inside store wore masks nose fucking chin. Munich I'm usually, see - literally stupid there.

I believe diet ""work"" also called too. aware chemical smells, floor cleaner. even smell like cleaner smells....off. Particularly scented, 'lavender'. 

Pizza tastes texture flavour. feel slime mouth flavour comes slight buttery, milky (not pleasant) taste salt, much salt. taste spice there's LOT cooking horrendous (so suffering love tells me) know stop seasoning. 

I honestly cannot even smell smokes cigarette now, unless three four row. 

On bright side, reason eat salad every day nothing tastes anything anyway. 

Not joking- can't even taste vinegar, feel 'zing' makes sense......

Wash hands guys. changed life strange, unprecedented quite sad way. add argument obesity, ever watched “My 600 lb life” know complicated. grew households enabled overeat caretakers. Kids whose parents smoke likely smoke, parents don’t give cigarettes newborns small children. child morbidly obese 6 years old, don’t know 6 year old smokers battling addiction. obese begin choice, follow adulthood much easily smoking. kid end obese fault own. like said, smoking well known horrible health even allowed advertised positively anymore. Food essential advertised, promoted, thrown 24/7. Literally food inescapable—survival-wise, culturally, intertwined every single aspect human existence. would argue easily understandable smoking addiction. moral arguments necessary. 
Also, going look link new study saw (maybe Japan) regarding smokers—stating actually less effected Covid something like lungs already damaged therefore less ACE2 receptors virus latch onto.... edit find it. ähm...nope i'm sure try mess Yeah, like getting hot heavy someone they're like like ""Oh think condom"" they're like ""No biggie hop in!""

Meta-analyses don't. like Anti-masker shooting shop assistant asking please wear mask. Yes, still get Covid. all?

South Dakota lax comes measures. Death rate per 100k look bad all. Especially compare places like european nations citizens locked homes since October 2020 arn't delaying 2nd dose money 

Yeah, meant ""penny wise pound foolish"" figuratively, might conserving vaccine now, end potentially wasting many weakly immune people.

My gut feel OK, well controlled trial, changing protocol seems little cowboy-ish. Things bit better Alberta, since free therapy provided Alberta Health Services. However, therapists provide generalist psychologists addictions counselors. need therapist that's specialized, go private route. 

I get prescription coverage AISH disability pension, limited covers. Well that's then. point living now. Maybe, travel patterns different places. think emerging markets get hit hardest, instance South America got much worse Africa, bustle interconnected society strong economic power public health education/inequality still catching up. Peru Brazil instance hit hard lot migrant labor lot medical support, forced go keep lot food home. It’s thing happened AZ TX then, boom months later spikes. think it’s really partial herd immunity among mixed people group becoming temporarily cautious things get really bad. 

We look % spread entire population, yet everywhere seems least 20% population trying hard (and mostly able) keep vector.  

Then 3 months later there’s enough population churn start up. think I'm well aware vaccine good news. definitely racists everywhere. felt like many years ago went college there, since I’m white, local racists assumed felt way non-white race seven months future, that's eternity pandemic. knows state pandemic then. U.S. 1,659 cases MIS-C far

Anyway, fact guys leading world getting people vaxxed says least know efficient. 99.99999- 15-24 vaccine researcher, welcome read. mRNA vaccines efficacy really outstanding, safety profile benign. Scientists nature cautious measured claim, created opening sceptics.

People may realize quality dataset risk/benefit vaccines - - far, far solid pretty much routine vaccination ACIP schedule. Finally! fucking delicious food!!! O, see article compare countries? Thx user replying banned misinformation. Anecdotally friends: 2nd dose knocks ass couple days. Could mental health problems readily identified rather hidden religious fervor criminality depending skin colour? don’t think full herd immunity it’s getting close. Look North South Dakota. numbers dropping since October.  never even saw Holliday surge. explanation could that?

That's pretty clearly what's happening. states peaked November continued fall - even holiday surge, none reached peak levels saw pre-Thanksgiving.

We're finally getting point look like states good deal immunity built left. California South finally hit level they're rising numbers stopped masking decrease that's happening Midwest couple months now. best friend agony arthritis pain, rheumatology appointment cancelled 8 times due lockdown, placed new biologic medicine needs, sure can't go shoe shopping, long one life saved right buddy? Trump Republicans downplaying pandemic “me-first approach” left world’s poorest vulnerable risk, said opening body’s annual Executive Board meeting virtual format. global scramble shots intensified infectious virus variants circulate. eleven year old daughter caught October. pretty mild. real champ isolated herself, one else house got it.

Scar everyone's lungs slowly. Turn oxygen tanks lifeline commodity... Sounds like hell movie. wonder people catch covid higher elevations fairing low altitude breathers. world fix climate change. society know end county sheriffs jurisdiction Boards Supervisors mainly, suburban counties like Orange Riverside, they're controlled Republicans. suburban County Boards pushed ""open now!"" message months.

But even still, part county wants first enforce majority-non-White area accusations racism would inevitably follow majority-White area people would complain Supervisor Council member.

Newsom exactly working well counties issues last ten months either. counties tend feel demands put underfunded result lost revenues (counties depend sales consumption taxes local revenue CA) little upside (County Public Health Departments already underfunded). Newsom also strongest political connections allies SoCal either.

Tl;dr: political pressure enforce lot pressure resist. Yeah. record pro vaccine going get soon. god goalposts keep moving hyper focus extremely small chance transmission post vax going mad here. Anxious time, brain fog, fatigued.

I really tired uninformed EU bashing.   friend mine contracted covid, gave wife. October said symptoms mild. wife dealing cough apparently horrible keeps night. I'm saying people start dropping dead gonna lot houses sale. little brother NEVER listens me. kids punk. vaccines 95% effective mention help make mild what’s issue? dates people supposed get vaccinated keep changing. work healthcare last week supposed start rolling patient vaccinations week Jan 25th, suddenly got pushed back. work large organization that’s generally top things, state county regulations change drastically quickly it’s wild. work data side pre-built tables make vaccination process seamless possible, rules change last minute logic tables. past days went getting ready vaccination patients vaccinating healthcare workers organizations county first. It’s chaotic mess right now. mediated reduction symptoms expected reduce transmission well.

Agreed, important note vaccines protect viruses also reduce transmission surprising. Singapore’s COVID contact tracing good actually got decent look asymptomatic spread, found people symptoms 3.85 times likely transmit virus. Note, people asymptomatic, presymptomatic. would logically follow vaccine prevents symptoms illness, also see similar reduction transmission drastic slowing spread virus. Fair play green energy, though know much actually due market forces becomes profitable, I'm still waiting hydrogen car. I'll give that.

Points based immigration, much like broader topic immigration, contentious debatable. say self good thing.

Go google number police officers police funding last decade, good.

Furlough bad, good effort there, though bumps planning dissemination information phase 1, way would've went, bad. However many self employed zero hours contract workers helped throughout crisis. I'll add job retention scheme nice idea, wrong policy wrong problem eat spread joke.

Well VAT increased, level taxation issue positive negative, without wider context debate.

What support Hong Kong?

Also nice finally feel like single competent thing combat pandemic, helps NHS actually running it, well done government foresight realise want order vaccines middle pandemic. Imagine lives could've saved base level competence beginning.

I'm also convinced 21 days 2nd vaccine pushed back 12 weeks mentioned before, hopefully cause world leading problems. bet infectious whole time. really think fucked detected antibodies 90% participants got vaccine 29days 100% 57days.

Good incredible news!

For personally important know many got severely ill. AstraZeneca example efficacy 62% (we actually don’t know yet) nobody got severely ill.

I fine vaccine easily produced, distributed efficacy 60% that’s protects getting severely ill. NZ islands better options. rest world doesn't. I’m American sponsored work visa. cannot leave country visit family, sisters wedding, grandmothers funeral, meet wife’s family first time. leave let back I’m citizen.  Welcome Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, enjoy stay! vaccines finished clinical trials prove high% protection worst symptoms covid19. yet enough data prove prevent infectious others. Oh boy.

I know sure what's happening Italy right now. doctor/nurse friends work hospitals. sure Europe.

Hospitals right 100% focused covid. Everything else side issue. necessarily comes urgency even routine surgeries - go fine, except march areas Lombardy hospitals never overwhelmed - say maddening amount red tape around covid.

New patient comes - nope. Covid test first. Broken leg? Covid test. Heart attack? Covid test. get hospital tested. creates gigantic amount overhead them, impedes ability work normally. They're actually lower level hospitalizations respect previous years amount extra work requires makes hard keep on.

I single anecdote cardiac arrest patient died wait long covid test him. Anedoctal, that's guy 50s. kind scary could happen me.

When comes urgencies think comes choosing lives. Problem is, non essential turned since October. (statistically) lead huge increase mortality 3-10 years road. live Italy right covid patient absolute urgency, would basically hospitals closed. effects public health going dramatic.

Will shut up, man? Well get there!!! There’s days absolutely can’t feel slightest ounce positivity, whatever reason, however slow vaccine rollout is, I’m gonna stay positive. we’re gonna laugh virus’ face soon enough. pretty even, UK ahead little.

Lmao @ conversation every time Ontario politics comes front non-Canadians might televise every location patient X went sure enough people figure .. let people pay expedited vaccines following reasons:

1. rich people going cut line anyway, might well make money it, use money fund vaccine production distribution.
2. Rich people getting vaccine makes poor people jealous want vaccine more. rich people getting vaccine makes suspicious vaccine safe, refuse get vaccinated. long run, letting rich pay go front line results people getting vaccinated.

This somehow morphed indefinite lockdowns, suck wear mask, 100 days, oh god look many cases today.

The plan never prevent cases eliminate virus control it. Which, largely, have. hot spots country whole overwhelmed cases. overwhelmed lockdowns. fuck ups Federal level since borders fall jurisdiction.

Exactly. strategy undermines public trust. ever happens outside zero me. Politicians haven’t touch regular people since industrial revolution era child labor still alive well. articles still live like vaccinated insane. single person know said anything they’re throwing massive parties soon they’re vaccinated waited 3-4 weeks 2nd shot. That’s it. putting life hold. Especially since politicians haven’t put lives hold either. Biden's plan 100 million people 100 million doses 200 million doses. keep mind getting vaccine disproportionately going likely virus. 35% Ohio 30% people vaccinated looking probably 60 65% immunity late April early May. point pandemic slow enough could start opening stuff quickly fucking late game figuring out. country? keep coming worse case scenarios making sure comes true.

First populace won’t wear masks. vaccines thrown away due policy vaccines getting arms.

There phone registry people get texted drop they’re get hospital. live minutes away multiple hospitals would show immediately; know I’m special regard. patently untrue. Please confirm facts making statements could mislead others. Never come semi-lockdown mode ever?

Besides borders, Perth's near fully open since June. Christmas actually set record footfall city, NY usual fireworks 'til 6am clubs close affair.

Either way, they're dampening expectations. can't introduce population majority vaccinated, due eg lack masks, social distancing etc - it'll blow up. either tell everyone start pretending live like rest world, we'll deliberately introducing early (which populace **do not** want), vaccinate people.

What's issue that? worth, cases Alabama continue fall one fastest rates country. lock since covid started, say continued life usual. Unfortunately even mild infection cause serious discovered Portland, OR. far better vaccines suitable poorer countries. death rates actually go first change who's getting infected. Senior citizens getting infected less often actually make death rate come even case rate going among younger people. think that's what's happening Israel right similar situation 80% senior citizens vaccinated. death rate new cases going really small. agree 50 60% enough resistance stop stuff completely. Probably get 75 80 happen. that's case yeah probably July August practical intents purposes likely resume normal behavior May including travel domestically etc.

I advise people take mask yet case. going months happens suspect.

They’ve broken many times year. Stay safe, everyone. EMA built standardize normal medicine safety procedures; knowledge never empowered emergency approvals. power lies solely national regulatory bodies EU regulation passed grants power EMA.

That said, read last paragraph article (which allow copy quote), EMA says problems differences trial vaccines mass production vaccines. So, far EMA concerned, vaccines mass produced never trialled. may still work out, maybe not.

The similarities tested product sold product would probably enough emergency approval, would still require investigation non-emergency setting get safe vetted vaccines. However, EMA cannot grant emergency approval, go hoops full approval.

So me, issue seems either EMA lacking necessary power, namely grant EU-wide emergency approval, power first granted idiot EU politicians national governments (but knowledge never was), specific idiot EU politician also named article, insisted everyone wait EMA approval, however long takes.

UK's regulatory body given emergency authorization.

It's mid-January, still cough. Im tired time, matter much sleep, simply going stairs enough exhaust me. lung function absolutely trashed, sense smell still mostly gone, days cough bad I've gotten nose bleeds.

Please, everyone's sake, idiot. Wear mask, sanitize surfaces, make sure stay away others avoid it.

Not mention would challenging vial manufacturing capacity. I’m reading actually sounds like reasonable idea There's doom posters, doom scrollers, there's meta doom scrollers. one's go doom scrolling doom scrollers bemoan doom that. guess puts observation butt end meta centipede doom. Western cultures tend prioritize personal freedoms, price paid. Eastern cultures much authoritarian significantly less freedom. Thus, there's fewer instances people daring oppose government mandates. anti-vax *talk* possible deaths risks high-risk groups getting vaccine opposed healthy young people??? Ok think perspective EU bureaucrat. job lifetime whole lot. rush approval vaccine turns 5-10 years later bad effects get fired job. approve pressure fire dragging feet. Either way exposes people accustomed taking risk flipping coin future career. wonder his/her glasses fogging anti-vax propaganda start questioning vaccine safe use words like ""guinea pigs"". 

This vaccine purely emergency purposes case huge spurt cases. Somehow stupid intellectuals care mention this. 

When start questioning one vaccine, information starts spreading general fear vaccines start develop. 

Just score political brownie points supposed intellectuals attempt create environment fear. absolutely clear trying politics start omitting important information jeopardizes argument. virus attacks blood vessels. body beat virus weakened state predisposition towards certain ailments might become reality result. Vaccine leftovers given out, left spoil.

I don’t see particularly bad thing whatsoever. Australia *had* contracts 200+ million doses. 50 million fell UQ virus.

Australia needs 50 million doses. troll, look writing, stop replying “the countries"" ? Like what? bunch blokes walk country ""investigate"" please? Japan everything open tell. could go indoor arena concerts December possibly even now, sure hell New Zealand/Taiwan community spread basically gone. disposable blue ones white edges ones want, metal wire inside top.

When put on, need really bend bridge nose, prevents air coming top, snug fit, less fog. 

I can't recommend reusable ones, I've never worn one. There's many people mild covid-19 symptoms never problems that. guess body recovering severe illness. sickness requires hospitalized weeks, chances high going months may develop problems. Britain, discovery came late prevent punishing new wave Covid-19 put hospitals brink deny lifesaving care. variant already spreading fast, abetted government’s lax restrictions fall early winter.

But Britain sounded alarm world, allowing countries close borders start frantically searching variant otherwise might noticed months. British scientists quickly published studies convinced skeptics potency. Battle Royale random loot dropping? games give parachute, Fortnite gives pickaxe, Warzone gives pistol unless play different mode take regular class setup. whole country probably isn’t going vaccinated end year.

The important, vulnerable groups though. false negatives covid tests 20+% believe. lockdown you? Healthcare hygiene measures causing delays scheduling patients, closing retail leisure industry, nighttime curfews, restricting private parties? much lower threat vaccinated wife can't transmit it. believe consensus though. got 7 chances failed them.

It’s unreal. Ooh thanks tip, helpful sister. Anecdotal, heard podcast, places asking people passing street end appointments ’shift’ want vaccine, rather wasting them. can’t remember details like state, go back wanted. Agreed acting like masks permanently required large events thing past. won’t be. don’t think would group people legitimate concerns covid vaccine “anti-vaxxers” together. decades evidence support vaccines measles, mumps, etc. coronavirus vaccine still fairly new. 

There expected high volume adverse reactions (given emergency release) still don’t information whether getting infected vaccination may give rise severe response (and talking otherwise healthy people). vaccine isn’t even considered vaccine scientists rather immune therapy given otherwise healthy people. concerns mRNA transcriptase immunocompromised people. let’s point fight informed consent, rarely seen discussed media. 

Some people don’t trust don’t know why. don’t defend people. least learn arguments sides. Sorry, new apologies asked, I've looked FAQ see addressed

Are expert opinions consequences leaving longer recommended 1st 2 vaccine jabs? know pfizer come said can't guarantee effectiveness could see things like virus mutating make vaccine useless result delaying 2nd jab? Yeah I'd agree, would sad day go authoritarian people us make bad decisions. people desperate good news would say yes important. mean, american site largely american userbase right? started wave, world level (europe) started iteration current one began September spread across country persisted. enough infection left another wave size one, especially vaccines. really mind wearing mask experts say ok stop.

The data relation confirmed cases, studies since early April 2020 suggested represent little 10% total infections.

Maybe 2021 assume we're catching cases early 2020... health experts will. Still admit many 50% cases go undiagnosed.

So 10%? 10% 10%? 1% total?

How many really talking about?

The reality know number yet, probably time.

These click bait fear mongering articles helpful, spread panic ignorance. probably roughly 75 million. add 50 million vaccinated total end January/early February. lot places virus go every third person roadblock transmission. Still cases, see substantial reduction something less burdensome health system. Yet Newsom take away dr license give leftover vaccines throwing away shots per day deaths..and got lot deaths exact course (32 here). Week sick month on. Ended heart problems 3 months though, keep eye yourself. Found ER basically heart attack. think national guard, FEMA, massive influx funding help massively. pharmacies online well. Fingers crossed get solid data J&amp;J coming week....

a national plan help tremendously. Plus use carrot stick encourage states hurry fuck vaccines work wonders. Excellent news. seems like dodged huge Christmas surge especially two month period social gatherings fairly rare anyways (between NYD St. Patricks day really big drinking holiday), hopefully number continues downwards.

Vaccinations 1m day, natural herd immunity last surge big benefit help stem tide vaccines ready everyone would waste lose sense taste. you? Thanks, that's trying say wants vaccine prisoners, smokers, ""essential workers"" people age 75. CDC chart showing death rate   still fucked then? Fuck that, let's ban walking force people stay homes. outside scary! real solid reason, I'd rather get 2 shot mRNA vaccine choice.

I take get, soon get it. Yeah, probably would prefer Pfizer Moderna right get AZ sooner take it. J&amp;J hell you? makes qualified determine insane set restrictions? Permanent masks? Get nonsense.  vaccine that’s likely effective SA strain? LA ever indoor dining? wasn’t last 6-9 months SuPpOsEd DiSpOsE MaSk 2 hOuRs. wasn’t surprising response April though prior pretty much reason someone would walk store mask would rob place. people paranoid masks way.

Especially younger people lived whole life knowing smoking dangerous. America: anti maskers murder security guard. actually presenting evidence led to. first result search terms. entirely fault study sent find peer reviewed wanted peer reviewed. Sad. Seems like could asked fix mask instead massive overreaction OK.  stated, see many people sending kids daycare absolutely to. Clearly, case, absolutely to! Yeah worldometer said would definitely showing impact. Check times Israel articles end significantly later that. guess June July That's bummer. I've also tried putting band-aid bridge nose help hold place.

Maybe, come stay pay taxes allowed leave. Vaccinating 38,000 people ND 113,000 WV huge feat. We’re talking difference 2-3% highest first dose vax rate highest absolute first dose count. 
Texas 1.003M first dose going weekend. 

As another person said, difference last 30-40% population matters most. 
Texas’s lag due availability. unlimited, would ~50% week. article young vs old country commenters seem think, developed world vaccinating healthy young people poorer countries vaccinate vulnerable.

There ethical truth this. problem vaccination programs complex difficult organize. Western countries stop efforts vaccinate population establish vaccine programs developing worlds. Instead, push ahead also help developing countries get programs set up, funded executed parrellel.  Tis jest ""gun-friendly"" f#$&amp;@! country is. Personally think real. We're getting point people gotten virus fantastic news. However, doubt results make mainstream media here, get higher percentage vaccinated, want maskholes/antivaxxers running around claiming they've vaccinated thus rona spreaders. guess forthcoming app help, easier ask people mask another 6 months. Try longer wire, enough go across face width glasses. Tuck folded tissue along top ridge mask, capture moisture prevent fogging.

Also, foggy glasses excuse. annoying, hardly valid reason potentially expose people. Eh someone college student fairly recently, really celebrate mardi gras unless NO, canceled already. בהצלחה “line sand date” restrictions end regardless percentage people elected get vaccine.

A-f*cking-men. 

Make far enough future people can’t say ‘what distribution channels can’t deliver enough vaccines then’. Say something silly like November 30th. December 1st restrictions cleared. State *now*. gives people hope *proves* we’re side - want get back normal - hate idea new normal. builds trust common goal get back normal. 

I’m sick hearing :

 - might keep *some* restrictions *a while*. Define *some* *a while*. 

 - *semblance* normalcy. Define *semblance*. 

This wishy washy “maybe normal” pisses people off. Draw line, give lots wiggle room, let people strive goal.  gonna happen. anything think go direction people care less normal think us 2 weeks past major gathering holiday. Well, fear “live” results differ “lab” result. Let’s see scales couple weeks. Everyone looking Manaus, Brazil means natural herd immunity. Many experts similar opinion looking 1st round disaster Manaus. obviously wrong. Reading guidelines written people sitting classroom surrounded covid positive cases much sway opinion. Would prefer 2 year old COVID instead? Definitely. Canadians get damn vaccine. know people won’t I’m masks used pandemic. Flu cases lower ever recorded history that’s due mild inconvenience worst. 

I doubt many people share sentiment, anonymity public want less spread diseases? Sign up. Disagree. old people gotten first.  matter workers get shot not.

We locked essential workers dieing, yes are, old sick dieing horrible rate. minute protected could mostly relax lockdowns. need longer nose wire glasses. needs go across cheeks, basically glasses width. straight depressing. like arguing eat restaurants they'll go business don't. policy interventions pursue solve without putting loves ones risk. people getting vaccinated extra doses left vials would otherwise going waste consider good thing. needs flexibility built guidelines avoid wastage. let get straight. 

Because article .com suffix it’s entirely appropriate loop US discussion, regardless content discussion. 

And *I’m* obnoxious lmfao Again. Canada reactive. 

If implement lockdowns regulation see fucked are...well you’re already fucked. That’s west can’t seem grasp. 

Also; implement regulations, far soft.

Solely, little late someone works university health center I’ve seen much depression post covid athletes. We’re seeing cardiac issues, chronic fatigue, also shortness breathe. Every athlete gets post covid eval EKG cardiac enzymes blood draw. reality feel like doesn’t hit months road still can’t focus breathe. feel bad kids. Florida's number kinda sus, we've seen Rebekah Jones saga. No, neutralizing antibodies antibodies block virus infecting cells. nothing whether infect others. Don’t go Drs office! That’s spreads! Stay home unless need hospital! Presumably 3.6% covid cases? Hospitalization around 20%. guess OP something like 20/8 = 2.6%? fail. virus got back outside China. traced back someone working port.

It also comparable initial outbreak Wuhan.

In Wuhan enough tests people got sick, never even got test. Serology tests later showed 500k got covid-19 Wuhan.

Now enough test capacity test every single person entire city twice within two week period. People ask avoid covid? Lol Kids shown get less frequently less severely. amount people vaccinated risk become something longer reasonable expect mass closures. Whether people like mass vaccination offered scientific reason return normal.  He's wasting breath. point like everyone rushing liferaft sinking ship. Tedro's talking ""Moral catastrophes"" means nothing.

The desire self preservation overrides altruism almost time. 2 kids spectrum, challenging year. Lots zoom therapies telehealth services. really good place last summer- fewer meltdowns, major escape attempts, better moods.... 
Then school started. virtual school offer SpEd classes. we're back frequent meltdowns struggling keep schoolwork. 

We're fortunate able stay home day them. cannot imagine families able get help childcare manage school. struggle 'normal' times, trying survive. say they? feel like answer different most. Therapy medication options work well many people, personally take medication (Though strongly considered many times). Paying attention signals anxiety gives also helps figure triggers. I, personally, lot social anxiety feel uncomfortable large gatherings. like since kid, never really thought it, finally started paying attention uncomfortable situations realized dreaded going grocery shopping many people feel like I'm way. realized like large family gatherings felt like expected know going so-and-so's life since last saw them, even ages ago. also worried people watching eat. normal things people time, reason stressed it.. I've coach situations tell one really paying attention much think are. slow process, get better.

Honestly, helped simply knowing could anxiety causing it. Anytime heart starts racing get bad tension headache chest pain, normal reaction stress it. learned instead immediately realize probably nothing tell pass own, worrying make better. 

To manage anxiety, try meditation exercise. hobby also helps (I picked woodworking recently). lot anxiety worrying brain race million miles hour find problem exacerbate shit it. Meditation helps better control thoughts keep spiraling badly. Exercise hobby gives something focus attention anxiety related. give monkey brain something else pay attention distract whatever bullshit trying worry about.

This got rambly, short: Meditation Exercise free help. Therapy medication also good routes take people. :) 50% population gets vaccinated COVID, still keep restrictions? kidding. Nobody wants living like this. know people giddy masks distancing forever people want get moving this. truth hurt much? Same. I’m always cautious anything attack CV system. blood circulating = bad. 

I’m always sad people don’t take human systems seriously. Good luck, doc. Trump 60 days clear that. almost word word argument people said China ""hid virus"". knew end Dec 2019, 20 Jan 2020, declared human transmissible.

Easy ad revenue. News/Media spend whole lot run article use last year one remembers. Hey flu season, run ""oh noes, hospital"" article, forget change year.

Bam, clicks, $$$. yah crazy, lot research mrna vaccines ever since Sars early 2000s. never tried new covid. Concert venues even give fuck people illegal drugs fight pit. would waste resources make sure 20,000 people wear masks? Well, case counts dramatically drop everyone offered vaccine. I’ve seen opposite. live left wing mask wearing area 80% people know gathered families. I’ll getting second dose beginning Feb. Even second dose, vaccine 80-90% effective month in. vaccine incredibly effective compared many vaccines. There’s indication vaccines effective new strains reason think could still pass virus vaccinated- that’s vaccines work. would highly unlikely vaccine prevent disease know yet still allow infection (and therefore transmission). two things worry about- actually works (it does, amazingly well) prevents transmission (of course does- yet people sub act like it’s real possibility doesn’t). 

So, I’ll living less normally month half. wear mask required to, I’m going live life. also might dick. booster dose effectively tells body expand immune response--if get booster dose, like putting capitol police front capitol building vs. national guard. Yea, defense, end, job keeping crowd getting way key people needed defended, process added risk. thing take half regiment antibiotic--it cuts number bacteria, kill vulnerable quickly, raises risk mutants make line spread others. absolutely would trust figures coming West Virginia, Governor School superintendents basically got together last week (over remote meeting safe meet person) said, schools going back, regardless covid figures, voted overrule local counties remove remote learning option order force kids back school, said that, 48 55 counties red state, since announcement, went 2k, cases day 600-700 counties suddenly orange, 

For entire month December seeing around 1500 average cases per day, announce kids back school regardless, ( removed school color code map ) suddenly cases drop dramatically. gonna say sounded extreme Hearing friends live there, came accept crossed list ""must live there"" places.

Maybe friends born bad places/cities/ambients, looks like better open pretty much ages (with elderly people example).

Oh definitely, matter normalized mask-wearing “looking others way almost intrusive” runs society given relatively low numbers spite overall government incompetence. 

Just got back three months country didn’t mask made aware short order. France plan compete vaccination risk groups 70+? Society going closed groups largely vaccinated. Unless large quackery movement France ruin this. Nice see properly worded article title once. many major media outlets would report simply ""30% Israel vaccinated"" ignore important distinction first dose.

PSA: forget second dose. Get time, aware takes another 2 weeks final level immunity, guarantee contract spread virus even get disease. much less likely serious symptoms, spread still get sick. know, reading comprehension hard, keep trying little buddy, know one day abl understand written words! Yeah, looking state numbers seems like trending well, part, several weeks Bro, people pretending covid exist better suits want believe. course they're selfish. Germany among developed countries highest number people mental health problems. health minister limit number licenced professionals field believes low offer psychological treatment reduce search it. ""Boom! Problem solved."" result huge number people wait months get help get any. found vaping strong marijuana hybrid helped me. it, top body aches coughing, point could breathe well believing going die. going cold turkey marijuana awhile, vaped felt lot better. believe marijuana would help infection afterwards due marijuana's anti-inflammatory properties. recommend it.

I spreading ""misinformation."" sharing experience viewpoint. would vape smoke it, however, partake. doctor. But, give marijuana try.

PS. recommend cartridge vapes due toxicity. Vapes like ""volcano"" prefered. Holding online exams proper anti cheat measures requires LOT supervision. 

Not many places able know right. Agreed. Anyone pushing restrictions next couple months seriously damaging society think us won’t tolerate it. Thank input. doctor believe could nerve damage prolonged infection. 

I’m anxiety medication, again, already odd prior health history anxiety/depression.

I know anxiety causing medical issues. meditating, guided breathing, exercising, eating healthier, etc. pains aren’t going away. panicky feelings almost gone, though days better others. 

I accepted anxiety something cope live with. it’s figuring new normal stuff comes along entails understand excuse Hello Mypillow guy misleading title, got remember long-term complications COVID, going massive strain health systems decades come.

I think part people come sub-reddit reassure us cases us nothing worry miss: new virus, really know weird shit going later line we're early stages.

Spanish flu traced uptick believe dementia neurological disorders people survived 10 years fact, late 1920's. knows surprises COVID store us? 


I fully expect within decade, we're going see ads class actions people forced come office COVID complications - ""Call 1-888-86-COVID book free consultation."" We'll fuck stops true. cold (a coronavirus, assume) kid sense smell never same. Since then, tell cold coming, sometimes, smell ""stick"" nose. becomes smell anything. People care, made parties, saw friends, made surge complete nightmare. reaped sowed. What's definition overwhelmed? saying way overwhelmed would worse spring? overwhelmed worse 2015?

In area US example hospital originally able handle 100 covid patients, using rooms designed patients, doubling things like able extend 300 also 300 people home treated wish could admitted opinion would overwhelmed factor 6.

But think better definition overwhelmed many patients quality care suffers probably happened various times past well oh, recall anywhere that's happened extended length time across much world think next 5-10 years we'll see massive increase people strokes, heart attacks, needing transplants etc. people affected younger norm pre-covid. We'll feeling effects long time.  late February till emergency surgery Thanksgiving day, mom seen three people (my sister lives brothers maybe twice). Hopefully reallocate budget military developments (excluding wages soldiers) increasing ICU capacities across country. would also prepare us future mutations that’ll pop many more. Also reallocate towards increasing healthcare workers pay benefits. lot tests designed people looking shit internet testing mind tragic, technically easily avoidable unnecessary, loss life. :( fucking job dense ingrate. Throw jail large vaccine passports would fine. I'd argue neutralizing antibody passports generally would fine that's going happen got downvoted oblivion pointing last night. Reddit believes kill got nothing worry about. So... cheap gas mask, filter goggles, combining cost $299. problem vials aren’t precise. 5-7 doses per vial don’t know many doses they’re getting. emergency wait list people.  hope intend follow entails. study conducted among hospital’s medical staff Israel found 100 102 vaccinated workers developed high-level antibodies disease. Senior doctor: “Most vaccinated people antibodies recovered disease. Meaning: see decrease morbidity coming days.”  there's money made american health care able influence companies give us doses first. That's top 5 per capita. procurement doses gone well agree. distribution administration doses cluster fuck. Believe alot places world handling virus way better US able things like exams  Nah pretty well known fact among cyclists training hard, chance getting sick lot higher (and pretty common see training hard catch multiple colds months). possible quit, nearly impossible stay off. relapse rate shows exactly that. People certainly seek help, prescribed first place. asking download. Advertising pretty massive tv around May. work all. endocrine condition that's put hospital many times. Please tell ""I'm sorry"" makes feel better heal faster, said. due respect system morons leaders. work health system healthcare employee. qualified. would've faced zero punishment giving you, many coworkers, vaccine. don’t think knew... *sees face helmet

Lol hey know guy Seeing people referring Norwegian vaccine deaths social channels. What’s lowdown this, bot accounts genuine concern dodgy batch?  slightest bit accurate. Color surprised good friend ground strongly agrees comment. fucking sick politicians health officials telling us need treat like emergency end emergencies blaming spread people getting together, TIME drag feet vaccine rollout personally treat non-emergency (going eat, traveling, etc.)

Open 24/7 vaccine centers! Stop closing testing/vaccine centers weekends holidays! Stop discarding doses! need act, speak, like emergency made general public. right we're asked believe eyes experiences. Yeah, vaccines works out. they're effective enough, hope for.

Still, 10 months now. they're already promising international travel 2021. sure worth. addictions “essentially impossible” kick. It’s nearly 100% relapse (it’s closer 91%). withdrawals “deadly” (however alcohol withdrawal be).

LOL bad, sorry 91% close enough 100% you. worst relapse rates nearly drugs. ‘The Day Earth Stood Still’ Remake Keanu...cause watched last night. realized winded walking stairs day.

I covid. really shape almost year inactivity.

I think contributes lot too. I'm disputing obviously. last vaccinations left given people, even big deal since herd immunity strategy apply vaccine supply large enough. explain really easily people test positive weeks months after, people actually test negative “healthy” again? Whoever said save old people? saying article’s headline makes seem like effect everyone, fact , effects small demographic. That’s facts article. endorsement letting old people die? anything trying help anyone doesn’t want read article, afraid taking vaccine. things effect elderly medical conditions differently average person. need calm down. unfortunate might safe sick elderly people, mean headline give impression we’re doomed take vaccine. [Here article written Dr.. Carolyn Barber Scientific America. links several studies recovered COVID-19 patients ongoing cardiac issues.

(Also thank keeping honest asking sources) Yeah think probably last significant wave Ohio. I'm cautiously optimistic. state good job early significant impacts entire duration pandemic Hell no, might even work, knows? likely weed cure *everything*? It’s oversold. Every claim works yet another ailment weakens claim works them.

I’m perfectly happy people using weed enjoy actually good. voted legalization state. think claims Weed Cures Everything hangover attempts justify legalization reality. ex Canadian moved Australia.... might hard understand inside Canada .... Canada top 5 superpower. Hell barely makes top 10, course back bus. selfish overreacting. understand consequences covid. stay vigilant. 

the people claim overreacting lack understanding personally experienced symptoms. words, people lack empathy. way find agreement they're stubborn ignore reject concerns. US rushing. US screwing badly, lying knowingly allowing people die. US counts underrepresented, consistent lack testing lack 9f available bodies handle influx people needing tested.. Vaccines wasted, crazy people trying destroy supply ability due lack control security protocols implemented fully direction netheranthal helm hissy fit win election.  high risk can't get bloody vaccine straight answer even hopes getting vaccine, pharmacies, clincs hospitals make announcement expiring vaccines, anyone building come get now. Never million years dream whole clusterfuks situation situation would occur decent amount world. maddening. wondering/hoping maybe drive research long haul symptoms viruses. knows, maybe us dealt long also benefit strides made. does, sadly.

You run data official figures, statistical deviation states/countries enforce mask mandates countries not. 

If add fact surgical/cloth masks threads way, way spread apart size SARS-CoV-2 really seems like masks effect. problem wearing one, can't help ask for, given data points masks effect spread. CDC updated vaccine count 3 days??  Even kind amazed blocked testing eg see thinking time - earth doing? going lead thousands deaths. yet go. guess maybe comes Trump kind scientifically illiterate understanding happening? bit?  fact we’ve got contracts far share vaccines?  surprised haven’t seen anywhere. common knowledge investing heavily 4 different vaccines plus COVAX. (The 4th Qld one got abandoned one side effects might temporarily test positive HIV.)

Right start they’ve saying wouldn’t put eggs one basket.  intentionally bought 4 different vaccine types (one mRNA, one viral vector, one protein, one molecular clamp protein) ... case weren’t successful. COVAX gave us access even different types vaccine (DNA, different viral vectors etc).

Turns vaccine attempts successful, looks like overkill. america's chanced anything meaningful pandemic went drain moment political party whose voting base conspiracy theories decided politicize masks. Exactly. knows long term effects? 
I’d rather never get all, flippant Today holiday numbers may look low today. sucks (honestly). I’m really sorry hear! curiosity, think it’s covid effects everything comes back negative? 

(And clear here, I’m covid denier also don’t want make danger seem smaller is. I’m generally curious doctors know it’s covid effects random thing might now) kid bagging groceries nose uncovered. loudly asked wife ""if know wear mask properly think washes hands properly?” split one company want carry cigarettes didn't. Even funnier company runs Trader Joe's one wanted carry cigarettes. !objectionbot  wrong that. We're quite sure genetically modified, there's way know lab leak result gain-of-function research repeated cross-species movement. knowing certainty probably *that* much value, fact argument entirely politicized means there's basically way we'll get straight answer even one exists. Speaeking TSA, that's another thing created overreaction threat, dubious efficiency, never gone away. people wonder people skeptical lockdowns going away ... military volunteered medics help. every bit helps get lists. describing borderline abusive enforced. main trunk-delivery store pick-up only.  feel workers much safer well us. Crazy thought... maybe hard time breathing... think that? hard time breathing mask covering nose breathe nose. shame. exactly disagree with? know bigger group people follow directions like usually standing around anyways someone currently lives Arizona, move here. air pollution horrible, ton anti science folks 49th education. know would willingly want surrounded ignorant people you. mean Commission. Country's reasonably well given supply procurement strategy approval process stifled rollout national level anyone struggling hospital debt look hospital’s financial assistance policy charity care. Many hospitals forgive bills make certain amount annually, even won’t forgive might cut half. Even don’t qualify might able negotiate lower bill."
