0,2020-07-04," Brazil 68k deaths 1.5 million know cases.

NYC 32k deaths 421k cases.

So, death rate significantly lower NYC. Europe severe lockdowns succeeded, failed. Close 80%, sadly. Lol pandemic ""essential"" ... times idolize playground game players make believe artists. pathetic. It’s Darwin. None conspiracy theories would impact anyone governments around world chronic, habitual, often ill intent, liars consolidated media run cover them. 

If people could trust governments media open listening alternative theories might actually going on. James Goodrich one talented pediatric neurosurgeons world. world-renowned work removing twins conjoined skull (craniopagus). Died COVID-19 March. tragic. oh man, believe Atlanta, used live myself. pay 5k ambulance ride one time lake lanier. make good point, jumped defensive tone little much/quickly response. many healthcare workers usually die year diseases acquired profession? crazy ideas like Government buying bus stop advertising space says literally “masks don’t work” - yes happened. I’m thankful social media fact I’ve met lifelong friends connected great communities centered around personal interests. It’s also way keep contact people life I’d otherwise never really around again, you’re right point bad definitely outweighs good big time. deleted accounts besides reddit patreon 2 years ago haven’t looked back. sure is! people zol Well, ""this year"" always short ""this year, far"" unless figured predict future. ""So far"" redundant. people Reddit know use Google verify things? Yeah bit eerie parallel right now. Funny enough got book whim really enjoyed it. add others said, NY's real peak probably much higher due limitations testing time. Seems like Florida headed pretty quickly though. It’s level reliability previous article, However, team said estimate viewed ""illustration"" differences population affect herd immunity, ""rather exact value even best estimate."" Username checks out. Oh, governor one hardest hit states social distancing totally mass gathering everyone wearing face mask Fuck them. words them. asking Americans act interest others? ""All lives matter""....but, real time. You’re obviously RN Thanks feedback, king. complaining young healthy people wearing masks walking rudely told need one. too? monitor d-dimer blood tests clots, inflammation blood marker tests, xray/ct scans prescribed inhalers/tylenol. prescribed anti inflammatory drugs Right, old around co-workers customers. think so. They...aren’t cheap point COVID, aren’t deals there. father programmer major health care provider (that still exists!) 70s 80s. back lot tasks first handed computers, coincidentally lot healthcare systems stated first big anti-smoking campaigns.

He said despite public rhetoric, management still Mad-Men-esque old boy’s club everyone middle management smoked like chimney office. dad never smoker, made formal noise disconnect public position smoking private reality ruffled feathers.

Not long after, fired trivial typo code, believes excuse real reason thorn side upper management unhealthy lifestyles. Mentioning old health care job still gets real worked three half decades later. NY stopped testing outside hospitals pretty early on. probably higher actual new daily case counts FL. I’m totally you, slightly different reasons. Humans close worldview experience trauma- greater trauma, smaller worldview becomes. Social media isn’t really problem, people fall bullshit can’t think correctly (trauma impacts frontal lobe decision making thought processes occur). 

Our systems (think criminal justice, medicine, education, really) cause trauma community, turn causes trauma (racism, sexism, polarized political ideation, etc- hurt people hurt others) makes trauma systems cause even worse. systems literally set use feedback loop control masses- people physically cannot think critically, people power stay power get make rules. China Russia know well, specifically target traumatized people propaganda countries, Russia targeting friends family. 

You’re totally right, real problem human behavior. also love controversial sort lurked Donald see up- oofda, trauma responses book worthy! Impossible safely. Used work Six Flags queue lines get hot fuck. average person wear mask heat. CDC share blame, it’s share isn’t even ballpark Trump’s. U.S. predicament Trump administration. Well they’re still graduating right? they’ll finish high school. 

Then go college. Senior year college much fun.  symptoms 4 days, (one actually pretty badly) shes basically fine now. dad pretty rough shape tho, he's still waiting test result mean given considering sleep bed not. 

I'm pretty much fine, slight cough, temp 99-100 times honestly feel fine. One thing definitely notice tho sense smell fucked. Even air weird smell cant even relate anything. doctor said pretty much guaranteed well, probably think fake... met one elevator building! hopped despite building management orders share elevators, mask.

Her: Oh worry, I'm nurse.


Me: Uh, ha, actually makes worried! around infected patients day!

Her: I've tested negative three times. antibodies too.

Me: Oh, okay, well, expert--

Me: building management say--

Her: They're medical people, though.

Me: want anyone getting evicted!

Her: yeah, well, evict nurse. India retroactive testing.

Someone died know pneumonia? listing COVID-19. testing bodies.

If identified virus death; labeled death. Yeah, lot restaurants packed given capacity restrictions. would think Reddit everyone afraid eat out! true! people are, many/most aren’t! guy perfect, clearly given billions charity actively encouraged billionaires mention, Maryland mandated. He's wrong. dumbass ex, who's paramedic trades, buys conspiracy theory bullshit, refuses wear mask public, kids either. tell mask cover face, ears Worldometers coronavirus year estimated 290,000 650,000 people die world due complications seasonal influenza (flu) viruses. figure corresponds 795 1,781 deaths per day due seasonal flu.

~650000 maximum estimate annual global death count flu viruses. moment world reached 530000 deaths 6 months. Although it’s smaller it’s much lower time frame.

In comparison deaths per day, 4489 deaths due COVID-19 recorded yesterday. That’s difference 250% highest estimate 1781 flu deaths. 

It’s safe say worse flu. Honestly, won’t matter. Cases go lockdown. Appears take 3-4 weeks. Every state seen this, banning outsiders won’t help. NY daily cases 3 days row now. 

Where think New Yorkers went lockdown happened? Florida. South Carolina. Alabama. 

As muck Governors putting quarantine restrictions, impossible enforce. It’s optics politics.  I'll [leave here. get saying that’s works out. happens get fed explanation it’s exaggerated it’s ammo fake news claims stick guns even harder. wish death upon people often? Maybe take gain superpowers? clearly airborne. 
f CDC admits airborne transmission, protocol negative pressure rooms PAPR hoods caregivers. know nearly enough those, say necessary. like everything else they've skirted infection control PPE pandemic, downgrade safety requirements match supply instead describe demand.

Take context. also dont really understand Germany well.

There tons people flying Germany Italy France Feb March.

They say Germany ""did testing right"", Berlin certainly didnt feel different. Barely anybody Berlin Facebook page tested.

There whole neighbourhoods didnt lock big maskless lockdown protests street far back May 1.

But somehow Berlin escaped outbreaks well. Possibly. metro Atlanta, like year ago relatively recent. essentially two surgeries, though. ERCP quite surgery done way, fully sedated all, actually cut guts. know much MS, friend mentioned symptoms similar discovered MS lesions brain.

1. Informed consent. People agree known risks. long term potential consequences Covid still unknown point (even though personally think low likelihood), variable influenza challenge trials, logic follows people cannot consent risks cannot known.
2. Manufacture distribution. earliest candidate, Oxford vaccine, reportedly already started production millions doses ready go September/October soon stage 3 results confirmed. successfully run challenge trial today works, immediate demand. know supply available right possible suppliers would prefer provide million doses fall rather tiny supply face dramatic political problems entails.
3. Legality. Medical trials difficult get approval for, ethical problems take time consider, would surprise organizations need make decision permit challenge experiment cannot reach decision months, benefit steadily diminish conventional experiment approach results. possible people expertise organize trial know never approved try. (And anyone tries step outside regular approval process condemned, like Chinese researcher claimed done genetic manipulation human infants make immune HIV.) agree would better everyone committees involved make call accelerate approval experiment, whole pandemic objective failure abilities make right calls, are. flu shot basically attenuated dead version flu. It’s basically showing immune system flu looks like, similar letting dog sniff item belonging person looking for. 

It’s possible immune system especially reactive flu, would bode poorly ever caught real deal. could also allergic reaction ingredients vaccine, - rare - possible.

I wish life like Starship Troopers. 7383 posts T_D  F girlfriend living together 6 years now. anniversary June 20th. left house *anything* grocery shopping since early March. agreed, fuck it, eating anniversary.

It disaster.

First off, restaurant ate bar, since regular bars closed, people frequent dive bars hanging nice restaurants, man, I'm classist, little weird dressing eat nice restaurant, biker gang seats over. hyperbole. literally happened. 

and can't relax, employees wearing masks, wearing mask, take eat. constant reminder current state US.

We brought hand sanitizer. sanitized table, silverware, condiments, end, took 2 bites immediately got doggy bags left.

It uncomfortable awkward situation. Freedumb! mean Facebook Maybe I’m communicating clearly, misread comment. think you’re go without saying, I’m going address it. comment replied regard hospital leadership Americans morons fault choosing careers field healthcare. particular comedy club doesn’t give fuck. husband tickets show last month still held event. told limiting capacity following CDC guidelines went, thinking we’d club maybe 15-20 people. arrived looked 100% capacity - small tables seated shoulder shoulder, masks required tables (only required front lobby). noped outta fast possible. Agreed, arrogance ignorance also partly blame, definitely.

Unfortunately, exploited political gain well - everyone nervous first rightfully scared. power leadership positions came literally played even cases hid data. fucked situation massive portion people play down, others take seriously. lot reciprocative deals. There's also European countries allow Shengen access exemption Portugal. alone allowing it. Genuinely curious see. realize sounds sarcastic truly know. think numbers US alarming though. COVID started getting real.

I look way- love America. also love good economy. pandemic, people country matter economy. I’m 25, take hit economically. seeing many people country die unbearable. care say. sorta til words fake news media. live Ohio saw soooo many gatherings house parties night time bike ride tonight. It’s going bad 2 weeks.  evidence that. Plenty healthy young people experiencing terrible symptoms weeks months idea they'll feel better they'll feel better.  recent spikes, yes. However USA skyrocketed \#1 spot long protests even dreamed up. penalty box go there. good advice. calorie counting.

When started, obviously way overeating, would write calorie count every day excel sheet. changes diet, writing down. also weighed every day way shower wrote down. bit troublesome first, eat lot fast food calorie counts easy find, eventually naturally memorized count item.

Eventually, started eating little less. comfortable, little more. little year lost 70 lbs. really felt like work all. sedentary fuck.

Anyway say confirm half-assing even barely-assing definitely good. main thing habit-forming. Make sure thing need every day. can't get willpower run walk, go mailbox take trash, find excuse walk door, that's good enough. time there, even money say fuck thing anyway. would shoes :-) 

It would one thing nurses taken care of, PPE shortage? thank you. agree 100%! That’s sad... pity people think. sick you? Dude necroposting. reference, 412 emergency workers (343 firefighters) killed 9/11. South Korea China cancelled lunar New Year holiday (Jan 20-30ish), right **huge** warning sign. anyone paying attention, like cancelling Christmas, Super Bowl, yearly vacation. 

It basically one step away saying comet going hit planet, CDC cluelessly staring feet. Yeah don’t know single truly antivaxx nurse work large major city hospital know crap ton nurses. iffy flu shot makes arm hurt, still get way. * countries handled pandemic better, economically lower death rate?

Read first paragraph, expecting reference followed. disappointed. feel like conspiracy theorist saying this, stories I’ve read people getting crazy high hospital bills like this, anecdotal experience surgery years ago, patients usually don’t end paying anything near that. Everything’s made points don’t matter.

The US healthcare system train wreck, don’t get wrong. reason exactly this, prices completely made nobody give ahead time they’re disconnected anybody actually pays.

But, cost healthcare actually bad people think based headlines. saying theres aerosol transmission since March, insisted aerosol airborne should.

The fact airborne part got reported media unsurprising, least anyone living around Tokyo.

Schools self contained bubbles matter much want be. source available right now, remember reading recently AZ patients sent NM, possibly NV well. even tell many big hospitals Phoenix metro area, lot. full already, honestly scary happen. Especially since Ducey appear willing shut much now. Something drastic needs change, fast. can't true. US best health care world. Pretty much every country world social media. Many, platforms US. 

And pretty much countries done better job controlling spread viris have. scocial media... 1 He’s wrong feel like gonna add fuel Internet shit storm that’s already taking place. Mainly people question ones think Gates one started virus (which obviously false). really wish people would shove flashlight ass shot bleach let rest civilized world continue on. Hey local Costco, go oregon! people getting anxiety mask itself, possibly coping mask for? mean, deadly virus killing tons people every day. Seems like mask least person anxiety's concerns pandemic. hug relatives kill them. sure wearing mask(that choose whatever kind want) rates that. America already screwed lockdown mate Interesting read.

Perhaps one scariest reflections post-covid world. know France many hope post-covid world mean better focus research, teaching, health, well little bit less global trade, re-sourcing key industries. I'm really optimistic that. may well covid actually increases power key actors, ushering world ever closer cyberpunk.

Extrapolating here, covid stays us years, scramble vaccine cure, difficult imagine health companies could get complete blank checks unscrupulous/hard hit countries perform entirely unethical tests. all, dictatorships already concentration camps minorities day age.

That's one many bad scenarios covid first step towards really messed world. ReAl?!?! fucking idiot comment like would turn god facebook mommy groups honestly get it.

There's even song this: 25th amendment, section 4 lets VP (Pence) cabinet pull coup. Rumors say they've thought past (long pandemic), never anything. 1) given I've seen, Pence's inclinations rather similar Trump, would little reason something drastic 2) reason, even pull coup, expect little change.

As DeSantis... that's whatever rules Florida has. don’t trust anything coming Russia this. best wishes Russian people, hope safe healthy find strength get hard time. people power there... fuck you. problems Press informs number deaths. deaths happen yesterday. Many deaths happened weeks ago depending results testing order confirm virus causa mortis.

This happens countries large numbers victims. deaths happened yesterday reported weeks also problem many people think President's fault. fact, Court called STF ( Supreme Court ). Court decided Governors Mayors responsible opening isolating States. President barely thing Governor different thing.

And thankfully enough: Bolsonaro, city state would imposed lockdown. mayors governors did, aganst wish. yesterday hragging TV stopping law made face masks mandatory... read article? Largely things civil safe. Isolated incidents brought knee jerk reaction.

Coronavirus! Coronavirus! I'm telling real! Shi\*t getting real! Woo! Hong Kong uses 14 days - far, total one case someone went quarantine subsequently tested positive. couple secondary infections, contract tracing HK works pretty well quickly located spread further.

The whole point necessary single measure 100% long everything taken together works well enough maintain situation establish source every detected infection.

Another example wide use thermometers thermal imaging cameras detect people fever. Obviously, test neither highly specific highly sensitive - many people suffering COVID temperature many conditions symptom. (especially using thermal cameras) allow quickly screen people *might* COVID follow specific test tells really do. so, someone start contact tracing from.
If showing symptoms obviously detected - case either end infecting anyone else (in case arguably matter) - do, infection spreads probability *someone* infection chain detectable symptoms rapidly increases towards 1 - point trace back infection chain original asymptomatic case.

Basically, none stuff perfect - good enough slow spread point contact tracing deal it. Become island NICE genetic engineering hypothesis would plausible differences two genomes would concentrated parts, e.g. furin cleavage site RBD. However, differences spread genome besides two parts based differences estimated RatG13 Sars-cov2 diverged decades ago. point, Sars-cov2 got better RBD probably pangolin coronavirus via recombination point acquired furin cleavage site. think backwards.

India started border conflict China distract failure contain virus. working well. need extra oxygen anything like that? Issa drawl b turns out. Never saw bullshit coming. Confidence silent.

There more!

Lol would fall public safety protection. otherwise countries agreement waive visas person entering restricted list really reason deny short entry. keep buying narrative it’s China’s fault irresponsible ignorance. 

Had paying attention, [China reported cluster pneumonia cases unknown etiology December ] — initially 27 infections Wuhan. 

This “novel coronavirus” indicated, anyone knew whether disease could wide spread. took another 9 days identify virus, ruling every cause—and genome sequence initially published January 10, allowing development rRT-PCR testing vaccines.

The US intelligence community already aware widely reported— yet government little nothing prepare.

The first confirmed cases US January 20 Seattle, CDC wouldn’t even tested guidelines, Washington state authorities demanded it.

All along way, US slow respond, failed testing, failed prevention failed containment.

Stop playing blame game realize China isn’t “enemy” — stupidity current American administration, idiotic supporters is. 

Oh wait, see you’re one.

So, yes, please “fuck off” bullshit. think so?

I seem remember Mexican health system supposed pretty good (in fact, much better one US, metrics), without information, I'd tempted trust Mexico's numbers. Yup, wildcard part lot people don’t understand. “Young people aren’t really affected I’ll fine get it”.. don’t KNOW fine! affects everyone. might poor bastard dies 65 year old mom symptoms. poster's NYC World attitude? NZ's natural beauty helluva lot nicer watching rats run around sewage spray subway entrances. Good point, healthy middle ground be.  last months basically ongoing proof American stupidity world joking years. coming clean hysteria. Came say But... context itself, USA good.

Just countries equal/worse, invalidate criticism US faces.

If volume posts USA upset, consider proportion Redditors likely going USA originating. sizeable portion user base very-much disappointed nation.

I shocked find much ""bashing"" (critiquing government) Spain, predominately Spanish-speaking forum.

Bashing really immature, sorry call guys really like that.

You need receptive criticism, unfortunately government inadequate. Im sure pour death rate per milliom stats face value, adjusted wealth population demographics USA looks *even worse*.

We know virus essentially 50:50 flip 80 year old.

6.2% spains population aged 80 older, vs 3.9% USAs population.

In fact, every single category 35 years age... spain higher percentage population USA.

We know deathrate pretty damn tied age, so...

America's GDP per capita ranks 10th place globally $67,000. Spain fall? 30th, $43,000.

Like, USA money per 1000 people fewer oldies... yet still really far behind countries disadvantages.

And *even* stats go USA, still bashing. Criticism government bashing country. need unmarry people holding accountable. personal attacks you, population. need seriously critical government. Hot dogs thing they'll eating later on. Late here. POTS, seeing type cardiology therapist helped basically get it. doctor talked lately it? 

The dysautonomia center nyu amazing work. Well I’d known 8 rabbit Sniff, died cancer. I’m sorry Sniff. US FAILED COUNTRY. far greatness BS literally brainshwashed daily. honestly, breaks heart. I'm currently servicemember ARMY also going nursing school. 

I fear future looks like. Back (Ireland's mortality peak) trearments less developed. much effective Every problem root attributed fundamental nature humans. However, accomplishments species based upon organise ourselves, work (companies economies) live (communities societies).

Social media enabler. Without social media fringe voices would filtered mostly ""the media"", steps needed order publish article, produce radio Television show.

With advent social media, already biased sources like Fox became even unhinged. voices consolidated self-reinforcing echo chambers.

We can't change fundamental nature humans, chose organise effectively changing it. way social media operates given. working, needs change. Lmao comments nothing ad hominems.

Again break bubble, stop brainwashed mainstream narrative, go open book, ready I'll happily conversation you. 

Hope great night! 😘 (like emoji???) I’m bartender, waiting stat I'm sorry, wish could :( forced people go back work environments droplet infection protection best. planes flying sealed environments way protect passengers want open schools.  know jumps infection rates. going get interesting, airborne China saying now. way put protections.   cases spinning control what? south suffering right air conditioning on.  temp drops north going get hit hard. 

They lock areas spun control. really going herd immunity. Assuming lucky enough immunity lasts.

I realized saying airborne Chinese told them. remember someone else saying credible evidence airborne. think last time believe phrase. demonstrated interests support few

Imagine Bali prison. Turkish. Russian Gulag. isolation. prison barely get enough scraps survive.

They can't go outside, would gladly swap chance stay inside slightly bigger area 40 days. Anything one room that's bigger would heaven them.

This IMO ""Second wave"" pandemic tends bad. First wave tempered caution unknown. Second wave falsely emboldened success suppressing first wave people foolishly think bad/not ""real"". 

Third subsequent waves muted, population traumatized by, frankly thinned by, horrors second wave. can't die third wave already died second wave (taps corpse skull wisely). Victoria state real community transmission. bit hard contract COVID exist state borders still closed. Same.

*”In United States, Gilead Sciences charge $520 per vial patients private insurance, government programs getting lower price. double-dose first day, comes $3,120 five-day treatment totally agree wishful thinking. I’ve wondering what’s happening well. 

I still laughed one links “hot air” though, lol. making claim here. scientists saying *to* WHO. experiencing culture Japan coming back experiencing selfishness numb to. kind made hate American. Yep, we're fucked Many dental practices charging $10 “ppe” fee must pay upfront receive treatment. Makes wonder wtf before!  aware infectuous kills old people, stupid. word it. perhaps 25 year old care spreading others. God hope New England incoming college students late August otherwise infection rates soar 😩 Rich fly greener pastures let us sit destroyed impoverished nation begin cycle destruction anew another country. information keep seeing medical subs suggest fatality rate 1%

It high 7% globally. currently 4.5%. people get 1% from? one SNL home episodes skit covid sports pretty spot on.... even willingly quit job (HVAC) avoid getting infected infecting wife baby. I'm lucky live Germany ALG basically money unemployed people worked least 2 years paying taxes. sure though start looking new job wait little longer... sure looks like second wave coming I'm Chinese living US even give crap China's numbers anymore. doesn’t give immunity life. few-months depending severity. real stats undoubtedly higher official ones, there's nothing like Brazil NYC height epidemic morgues overloaded. expect current state continue long time, half people wearing masks shops public transport city government little enforce rules. complete confidence authority Also rich people shit following rules. They'll busy trying sneak ""away game"" families hotel rooms.... nurses doesnt mean cant life latest poster protect doesn’t mention masks.

I see longer booklet recommend barrier caring someone Covid-19, may guidance use mask, isn’t list things general public still. current outdated though. stupid comment, comment knowing little testing March need serious reality check. takes special kind person yell somebody making minimum wage......for reason. Masks result small inoculation. less sick infected. Correct im wrong, assumption accounting full spread COVID leading 2.4 million deaths?

And followup, estimation taking consideration excess deaths may indirectly related COVID? believe catch sooner later.

And america starting blocked rest world. time charge late... Wait, shouldn’t self quarantine 14 days? could go third world country pay 55 night! bad room shit, tools dirty, may types medicine! would cheaper US sure It’s called hyperbole illustrate point illiterate plebeian Young, college dropouts Reddit twitter chance. Ah, so, America, except leader isn’t actively condemning masks?  Well, that's karma get interspecies sex. say, 'The wheels karma grind slowly'. Like, 60,000 years case. I'd take literature grain salt case. months ago told there's scientific evidence mask work, common sense. proof work pretty well. Holy shit check sub reading comment.

Someone call based department point idea freedom liberty defined ability berate service workers disturbing amount Americans. see spikes countries flattened curve? parents live mountain / hill region...

No hell would use normal bike there... Moving work seems like reasonable reason, followed 14-day quarantine requirements, there's much risk.

Companies need hire people. people like this, anything intelligent anti-American Malaysia quarantined persons coming at... selected hotels (citizens hotel fees sponsored months) least 2 weeks. allowed even tested negative case false negative.

We're single digits per day now... Ration without leaving homes? food move? health care? plenty people live (Montreal) believe masks, think lockdown massive error judgment, think upcoming vaccine inject nanobots, generally believe pandemic fake tool designed Bill Gates others profit. one wearing masks public. Places like Walmart given - used wash carts make wash hands prior entering - that's gone. Restaurants opened people crowding bars pools now. like never happened. Remember, Quebec extremely liberal vast majority population abhors US US culture attitudes. Dude game basically ""let's take turns touching ball guys, breathe extra hard!""

It's stupid Basketball Football, still really, super, fuckin' stupid. rise it

It's learned helplessness point. every protest brought meaningful change, tens thousands not. that. They're stupid, think entire problem happens themselves. point infect others die, go silent. answer like ""whadya care kill grand parents.""

They're dumb, aware infect others.

I hope generation responsible, nopes. They're stupid normal lol. True, he's made worse Wrong  France gotten virus manageable levels, whereas us there’s rising cases hospitalizations majority states. along fact one wear masks, especially kids, people concerned about. Yup: bet read book five times got subsumed shifting tectonic plates books live amongst 🤣 

I also read Laurie Garrett’s Coming Plague two three times, Hot Zone, stack pandemic-related books. 

So first reports popped new virus China, began paying attention. watching swell like biggest tidal wave disaster movie headed toward shores thinking “Where grown-ups?” “WHERE GROWN-UPS?!!!” came worst jump scare all: grown-ups. likely spain enough infections effectively herd immune point (there never another spike even virus lingers forever). 50% deaths per capita US basically occured march april.

new york city same. almost one dying anymore. never went stupid hydroxychloriquine road. completely different ineffective drug leaders touted wasted tax money hoarding. Before, thinking the. virus hitch ride water droplets. meant virus could travel far as, states air long as, water droplets. 

Now, saying, virus airborne, need water droplets. means new set physics, meaning virus travel stay air longer previously thought. think Texans opted ventilator, bad running That's quite dichotomy. becoming full RNs, like, nursing assistants? Cuz matter school go to, becoming RN gonna hard work. Clinicals studying whatnot. ""There also indication death rate lower coronavirus become less deadly, Dr. Ogbunu said. Mutation normal part virus’s evolutionary trajectory, genetic changes [often 


Perhaps wishful thinking but, reported throughout last days, virus already *has* mutated - fact, reported Houston several weeks ago new ""more contagious/less deadly"" strain detected. Consider reports doctors Italy, NYC, Pennsylvania indicate even older patience experiencing less serious symptoms.  


These next ""two weeks"" telling. see proportional rise deaths (as many anticipate), we're fucked. However, death rate still remains low, t*he obvious answer* virus, itself, mutated direction viruses want - easily spread less lethal host. 


Sure, know people might question credibility reporting sites - still something consider...  I'd definitely rather zombie tbh, seems like much nicer time. They'll forgive coming weeks. I'm sure it. heard I'm sorry. sounds like really terrifying prospect.

Has talked doctors installing port?

There docs might push back ports high infection risk take proper care it.

But port, she'd able continue weekly treatment safety home. logical, to-the-point counter I've heard. Good ya, pretty damn tough dispute that. be, making criminal policy depriving people freedom, exposing covid jails, fining assumptions feelings. strong guidance studies showing otherwise. actually say her, I'm curious response; though, course, answer comment, freely admit lot curiousity. 4 weeks now, deaths far, far higher. Remember lag. Well certainly still help. understand cover nose get tons effectiveness, though. that’s true, means coronavirus could spread ventilation air conditioning systems businesses, schools, nursing homes unit blocks


We’ve known this... doesn’t mean it’s airborne, means survive air conditioning longer, spread ventilation. we’ve known since cruise ships.


Jesus sub jumps anything doom gloom click baity treasonous federal government would get n95s fucking citizens, maybe, MAYBE looked like girlfriend 
That February last year Wouldn’t make infectious? deadly would percentage individuals infected die, right? Wear mask know stop airborne particles? Yep. Also assuming eating drinking entire length flight. Nope worth right now. Hi, umm, that’s exactly source gave you. Ultimately 53 cases June 5. doesn’t seem support “kids don’t get COVID” thesis. Especially consider elementary schools opened, 50% public schools returned, limited time. I’m really looking source says kids don’t get/spread COVID. stairs really better? live 50 floor building second floor, I've taking stairs longer pandemic. Many people taking stairs, they're much harder clean elevators. know wipe buttons probably every hour, think they've done anything stairs months. know ventilation like either. decide whether wear mask not!""

Here Japan there's law public, choose wear one anyway also made choice respect protect everyone else (by off-chance really asymptomatic). Same. brother nurse Texas someone hospital tested positive Covid-19. everyone else works directly school children, especially bus drivers cafeteria staff, many seniors taking part time work supplement income. families well. thinking loud, pretty uneducated finer points issue, would constantly running certain types air purifiers within elevators help issue? I’m speaking *specifically* elevator usage.  FL parents insane, 3/4 want in-person school weeks? understand concerns childcare sending kids school going infect everyone else, parents want school board sent survey parents various reopening options ranging full reopening online-only instruction. received 18,000 responses; 74% saying want child back school in-person instruction 26% want child kind virtual/remote learning. Meanwhile, US lock even 50k cases day. Absolutely trick question? use key front part want quote. We’re discussing virus, urine coming someone’s pants. like Jackass, infectious diseases. call bull. still saying ""It droplets!"" good evidence that.

If scientists think coronavirus airborne damned well better give good substantiation article. idea You’ve heard predominant strain mutated ten times contagious, come outbreaks linked dental offices? seems like bunch scientists enough facts. Children 11 wear masks. last week every adult wear one school since protocol update mask farther meter (3.2ft) child. practice people wear anyway. understand four months still rationing PPE way know whether permanent damage common yet virus even infecting people year yet. heard piss analogy? heard piss analogy spitting idiot speak. people picture makes they're appealing them? spent 100 days inside deadly pandemic want freedom now? ridiculously selfish anybody attended pubs/bars etc socially distance.

It’s face shield, makes even ridiculous. wear face mask 10+ hours problem. People do, selfish  Given school closures already caused three months ago, probably nothing worry about. remember months ago videos showing animations virus spread real life scenarios confined space. One bus China, another office S.Korea, numerous people one section office got infected. one office suggest keep windows open. may 3rd can't recall now. many examples.

 

 used stay home alone 10... , others it. Get grandma something, knows.. younger ones solution for. culture America wouldn’t tolerate level authority. It’s probably biggest piece problem USA. Social media conspiracy rumors, science illiteracy, feelings entitlement personal freedom community also part problem.

But biggest one significant portion population armed risk authority show force people supervised quarantine.

Key word rushed, dumbass. Thankfully I'm many meds, take around years. Cool story, doesn’t answer question though.... Heh. Like guy said saw post doctor internet? doctor said virus. bacteria treated antibiotics. 

Or woman, outraged could get piss test...Who ranted chimpanzees, we're perpetrating hoax? 

I've got came from. long wearing care bothered are. Agree, isn’t possible FL detecting higher percentage, many test kits available, number actual infections lower?

On hand since new infections seem younger people tend fewer symptoms, maybe it’s actually higher. Aborted babies contagious airborne virus? Aerosol precautions. It’s different issue airborne transmission. couldn’t doubt aerosoliaation occurs known about, extensively, since SARS 1 2003 spreading ICUs via nebulisers. need full aerosol PPE set donning doffing procedures established even first patient. first spike testing limited, even lot young people getting it, idea qualify testing unless ended hospital. New York's positive test rate peaked 50%, means even lot serious cases probably getting tested. 

Now even Florida still less 20%. probably starting get rationed now. testing younger people people milder symptoms, better picture spread vulnerable people might able stay isolated. states continue take minimal action, seems inevitable eventually start spreading within vulnerable populations. better testing may mean catch cases earlier, people eventually start dying.  systems filters. I’m willing bet handful pediatricians kids sit fall, despite recommendations public. Drinking alcohol pathetic give fuck think someone drink responsibly. addictive drug damages liver/body causes manner social problems, drunk driving people get run over/killed, domestic violence rape, mention cost NHS treat people alcohol related disaeses illnesses. 

Alcohol smells like disgusting combination piss cleaning product (well, *is* cleaning product). I'm sure there's percentage population freaks actually like taste/smell alcohol (like Marmite disgusting), people like smoking image/rebellion/desperation look cool ""adult-y"" there's way alcohol downed like smell taste piss/cleaning product. buzz, image (I'm cool/sophisticated/an adult now!!!!!), lowering inhibitions shitty society made tightly wound unable express yourself. Pretend like enough eventually convince love want every meal. Guys getting 'buds sports, women wine/prosecco oversized wine/gin glasses, college kids red plastic cups parties, office workers default social activity drinking local, socieities wine meal norm, shallow pathetic ignorant risks involved. 

The point drinking alcohol goes hand hand ignoring risks. stupid enough smoke drink alcohol aforementioned reasons knowing full well damage drug causes risks associated it, stupid enough take coronavirus seriously. favorite go, ""I heard \_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_."" Referring, actually, something read sub well touted heard mouth world-renowned epidemiologist.  fearful comment, upvotes gets, signifies validation truth.

Yup. using term airborne super fucking loosely Pretty sure they're still first wave... hospitals overflowing seems likely virus mutated become significantly less deadly. Yes indeed can, joking! hope would apply privately owned corporation. know camps 1,000% denied medical coverage relating covid Exactly.. Well guess done flying.

You simply wear mask. currently mandated many airlines anyway. Hopefully fire blood suckers.

Except not. governor made temporary law must abide by.  Somewhat yes. 

There one released recently said 75 percent people asymptomatic time testing nursing home recognize *some* eventually develop symptoms...and read studies (or pre-prints) follow line thinking.

That’s semantic bullshit think you’re smart enough know it. really doesn’t matter fuck referring speech we’re talking about...the fact matter downplayed virus beginning, said would disappear, discouraged wearing masks, importantly politicized entire issue whiffed spectacularly chance uniting country common cause.

If President taken decisive action back February many lives would saved would talking excited kids back school months football TV. unwillingness wear masks public could one reason. brother wife flying Dallas Florida see parents. shrug anymore. [a study 75,465 COVID-19 cases China concluded ""Airborne spread reported COVID-19 believed major driver transmission based available evidence"".

The science mixed beginning pandemic, still mixed. article makes persuasive case author cited professor atmospheric sciences, virologist immunologist.

[Another article stats? friend mine currently arguing everywhere America reporting deaths due covid (attributing suicides car crashes) really wish articles like would put link source material. think social media (including Reddit) done society. I'll ask parents, boomers, would ever happen 60s 70s. imagine yelling 16 year old girl who's working ice cream shop. leave 5 dollar tip, cause people ones working pandemic probably kept society falling apart back March. Expat teacher trapped usa. school China us work online border opens. Good luck godspeed. many people contracted covid flying, proving plane. Considering time exposure time u get tested anywhere 7 21 days get sick plane? Airport? Grocery store? Someones house? taxi uber? impossible prove people sick, bad pollution day, yeah. 

You often see masks worn Asian immigrants larger U.S. cities among Asian (foreign) college students. Pre-pandemic, Asian Americans tend wear masks nearly much foreign counterparts. Honestly limit long could room family, leaving house escape hear news stories younger people dying infections, however health younger people never considered. know older people immunocompromised vulnerable, possible younger deaths immunocompromised, younger people vulnerable thus age playing apart this? elaborate ""people like me?"" realize doctors tremendous power billing process, right? God bless hardworking doctors Canada, Europe, Australia went profession heal patients instead exploit patients. I’ve lived friend currently lives there. It’s 100% culture masks, cleanliness, general caring others saved them. 

Not government’s response of: half assed lockdowns, difficulty getting tested, lack contact tracing, paltry one time stimulus check Yay! Wear mask, practice good hand hygiene avoid crowded places. Grocery workers, delivery people, first responders worked pandemic without massive infections. cautious abd follow guidelines avoid infecting family. parents who've returned work gotten sick. They're reusable right? mind buying one reusing it. Shut baby dick Dude updated social media infection, recovery, trip Fire Island. reported employer authorities. family members thinks numbers boosted damage Trump Michigan first day deaths... That's line, yes. lot less fanciful now. Yeah 3 months lockdown. preparing mad max style apocalypse. doesn’t happen I’m least hot af now. Lol! Aerosolized Cheese. forgot shit even existed. I'm jealous posted archive link, that. approved Independent post subject really get upset here. NYC area--these party girls visiting country they'll spread across US , like Winter Party Miami! want sweet pneumonia vac. Sure cheap whore insurance won’t cover answer.

&amp;#x200B;

Cases started rising 3 weeks ago.

The average time (for people die) die Covid 3 weeks (sometimes much longer, IIRC 3 weeks avg.)

also cdc- takes extra time code COVID-19 deaths. 80% deaths electronically processed coded NCHS within minutes, deaths COVID-19 must coded manually, takes average 7 days.

&amp;#x200B;

so takes 4 weeks death trend move case trend moves

so means see increase death rate recent explosion cases, starting next week. also around time lot hospitals near capacity believe July shit show. I'm ready scoop cheap florida real estate want wish someone would try make wear mask  don’t want take healthcare workers’ time hospital resources could well staying safe home. much dying breaking something really choice go ER. mask ways considerate, general people nurses, doctors, others work medical centers. plan volunteering trial soon one becomes available! thought warm weather killed virus? lied to? nobody actually know anything virus? daily political briefings bullshit? Surely noy. full faith government. vaccine created roughly 6 months going rushed. normally take years trials alone. one rushed due urgentness covid, risk vs reward going vary person person. high risk people may take probably ""good enough"", isolate wait see. non-wild animals! poor corgi beside night. long think Keto healthy diet. goes post-Brexit trade deal US then... cereal !! Coco Pebbles &amp; Trix specifically! guys waaayyy better cereal choices there. Wife 2nd trimester. I'm already working apology speech. think need encouragement swim alligators dark thank didn't. know why. true. there’s still vaccine likely ways go one. 

So time tell countries fair.

6 weeks ago Brazil India seemed largely avoided this... battle. Every country opens gets slammed shortly after. Meanwhile economic toll keeps ticking people like separate economy health completely linked. Thank you. I’ve arguing here. Haha relate! Channeling extra energy exercise super helpful me. I’m really happy Toronto! Awesome job! 💚 500,000 people dead. server beachside restaurant Sarasota, FL. worst handshake anyone I've ever met. Like weak sloppy fish Covid still massively undercounted look year's pneumonia death numbers compared prior years. true, maybe Spain finally allow secession Catalonia. Bad should. addition supposed end June 30, extended program another six weeks, businesses still apply receive PPP funds right now. Absolutely excuse. USA, anyone actually know anyone ticketed fined complying state areas mask requirement? Im Spokane tell place pretty much ignoring mask rules overall. places regular, instead looking without masks crazy us wear (i everywhere go assiduously) get looks ""your crazy"". know Yakima huge agricultural workers see there, think stubborn ignorance locals making surge happen. left house 4 times since march (total) time same. went yesterday supplies (prescriptions) store maybe 3 people masks employees, maybe 6-7 others without them. addition people arent respecting social distancing either. fully expect Spokane explode cases, fear tip iceberg. sure many countries around world western countries done. Yeah. successful strategy used Chinese millennia indoctrinate population obedience authority them, I.e. parents, grandpa, government Emperors. Great way establish dictatorship. ground here:

My neighborhood one party (college kids), one family gathering, otherwise quiet. Middle-class neighborhood.

Mask participation urban areas pretty good indoors. Close 100% non-restaurant indoor. Outdoors would say 20% participation.

Facebook parties showing. small 4th gatherings (4-6 people). think lot flaunters learned post social media.

Lots Arizonans going CA weekend beach weekend feed. Fair amount outdoors recreation state (camp, fish, boating, consider pretty low risk).

It good see Sunday numbers slightly, expected up. Possible mask orders working.  Everywhere except “land free” seems recovering COVID 19.

Meanwhile America hitting bigger worse wave. woulda thought, 4 months virus 2 months quarantining shutdown, open soon 4 months pandemic getting bad it. Truly incredible think about.

Then u got tons ppl saying “I medical condition can’t wear mask”. “It’s infringing freedom” “I can’t breathe on”.

I’m starting think masks fine. reason Americans issues “breathing”, bc 40% obese rate. Almost 1 every 2 American obese, overweight, obese! 1 every 5 children obese(it’s higher this, 20% like 5 years ago). That’s u can’t breathe, even without mask u can’t anything physical without issues breathing lol. It’s mask buddy! 1.7 billion dollars hundred million. largest medicare fraud history got scott free. Irrelevant, good one. Interesting shit talking going online bad Florida one county top 200. video posted people protesting Dutch covid measures, including usage masks. search fairness, 1 cba cba googling. said that, United States unique, far worst. Well, yeah far im pretty proud country general. dont want us lead anything ""hold torch"", lets entire EU lead instead. I'd happily risk life odds way better. Well.. I'd argue ex-patriots *are* smart ones. Welcome true People Color Experience. basing high likelihood on, nobody clue long term affects yet. like government fucked making application process routed big banks. Minority owned businesses barely got SHIT NYC seeded Europe.  Left cell phone sales get tech 6 years ago, best decision I've ever made. sound lot like did, back then. wish best, pull off.  based hatred due fear feeling superior course race bateating virus spreader, aka classic racism. sub censoring conservative voices. Go truth. Cow pee India, bullshit US, equally ineffective. Wth remembered completely wrong, sorry. number EU countries still closed borders UK citizens quarantine them, Austria, Czech Republic France. Yeah. lack testing easiest fix one critical lapses leadership. 

If tested (and re-tested) significant part population, would large areas remained open lockdown (because zero low cases) many areas locked longer. 

As is, we’re winging aren’t willing relatively straightforward thing obviously necessary since virus even got US. Lol like ready made excuse day drinking work. 

But yeah, theory makes sense. mostly back normal there, yes home still dont clean water least university honest switching online learning. bad lower tuition.... Two reasons:

1. billions N95 masks nearly every country world, shipped China early because... well China pandemic first buying masks like crazy. caused shortage masks everywhere else virus started spread outside China...

2. President + 50 governors saw what's happening China, done absolutely nothing either stop mask's outflow ramp production masks. think even realize masks work. Read comments KSAT website even depressed. I'm fuckin proud right now. God bless guns. Yeah 401(k)s /s mean, i'm worried end severe case anything. temperature like 98.5 right 98.8 99 bit ago. think stays range, i'll hold anything. want get test unless definite could it. symptoms dry throat. much cough feel fine otherwise. What's issue public transportation US? I've seen videos people line cars get food food banks!!!!! Like, wtf??? Sell car buy groceries. americans consider cars important bread? bad public transportation US? Skeletor me. pun intentional? wish they’d focus staff, “beds.” Ambulances waited hour unload bed available staff. Quality care impossible spread thin exhausted like this. I’m sorry staff going through. company Houston office open, despite us able work remotely. Gotta butts chairs satisfy boomers. I’m reading sub true, never go back gatherings ever. much risk involved. 

There ways socialize besides huge gatherings, Americans either paranoid one hand carefree other. oh god, let Trump see I’m Texas. know lot people heading Florida. head panhandle I’d suggest people desperate break/vacation Florida convenient solution, South Florida works too. Many cancelled Mexico vacations switched Florida well. Yes. pressure changes actual percentage O2 still 21% Bad news: many people going listen take preparations? known cases planes last months? seems don’t hear airplanes mainly bars, protests, big events. ""Operation Warp Speed""  take years clinical trials create vaccine minimal health risk. I'll sidelines information regarding virus treatments available. Beginning end, humanity is. I'm gonna say somewhere else guarantee vaccine sort coming election.

Also considering countries hopping Oxford train, spending billions make doses cost, would assume smarter people looking data helping make call. I’ve got good feeling it. threat? Romulans strip clubs? I've never, anyone worked with, able refuse patient load. may law name, it'd definitely supported. I'm boat this, denied patient load, would kindly told go home come back. lol read asking gov purchase middle seat airlines makes $ consumer protected

wut saying protests absolutely risk free

Except fucking comment replied ... little (if any) evidence protests (which outdoors non-stationary) contribute covid spikes...

Which literally says contribute dumb false equivalence compare indoor bars restaurants

Aaand literally never said that. 

Jesus guys argue 1 good point without resorting strawman? American Airlines permanently leave chat. They're done. Pretty sure would go code ethics. mean pretty obvious concept want wear mask potentially protect people socially adjusted. explains passive-aggressive ""How nice comment?"" wondered tone. Darwin fist pumping No! really care infect others die. family member dies, they'll psa CNN. children cannot learn zoom. 5 6 7 year old getting distance learning getting educated. Children also need social interaction peers. certain windows time children need learn social skills brains change things become much difficult.

Like, there's *nothing* could remedy kids grow older? Would like 20% US population got afflicted moderate autism, would worse US? 

I moderate autism &amp; went ""Speech"" sessions 4th grade formally learn social skills, &amp; COVID hit got sessions keep working social skills. 

Hasn't issues parents sticking screens front kids instead helping kids develop socially? 

Maybe time begin formally teaching kids social skills curriculum kids much equal footing age? ""I prefer dangerous freedom peaceful slavery"" translation Latin phrase Thomas Jefferson used: ""Malo periculosam, libertatem quam quietam servitutem."" also translated as, ""I prefer tumult liberty quiet servitude."" Ah yes pro life party hard work Never going happen. People never go another one. Well yeah. supposedly self isolating pending results. get shitshow acting responsible. yet run gator I've saltwater. typically stick freshwater. biggest things could cause death/injury order
1.I get cut bacteria infects it. reports every year flesh eating bacteria watch cuts second looks infected go Dr lol messing around that. 
2. hole kayak re-opens sink (90 percent time I'm fishing water stand sometimes end deeper waters) 
3. Stepping sting ray

Dangers freshwater (I avoid summertime)
1. Brain eating amoeba 
2. Alligator attacks, rare guess summertime prime time gators. even least bit surprised? expert matter. guess would it’s related $$$$... know hospitals get money per Covid case stuff like that. don’t really know. places country actually overcrowded That's old news. They've published 96% similarity SARS-Cov-2 virus found. That's people got know origin related bats. testing capacity sufficient test every suspected case makes sense focus testing vulnerable group.

Yes, capacity there, least period. Västra Götaland, example, tripled number tests one week, simply changing criteria. three times much capacity using.

Right start, people questioned decision stop testing suspected cases. never real evidence made decision capacity keep testing people.

It seems decision made decided let virus burn population, eyes knowing true number mild cases actually detrimental might lead people even cautious government recommending, potentially interfere goal achieving herd immunity.

When became clear going achieve herd immunity short term, changed back could get better picture really going on. yet want open schools pretend won’t issue hospital concern level downgraded couple weeks ago received significant pushback governor. took charts showing “unsustainable capacity” offline changed colors make everything look nicer.

But underlying data remains same. They’ve moved past normal ICU capacity entering “surge”, claim fine based bed counts. already stories Houston hospitals running low staff running critical meds, projections may optimistic. !remindme 2 weeks Good luck! still right.... plenty people crowd wearing them.  Several masks pulled down.  Normally you’d right outdoors aspect, they’re packed like sardines shoulder shoulder. take time body adjust help feel fuller? Anytime low-carb meal (even one protein/fat) get hungry pretty quickly, never feel full typical portion carbs. would like us stop, call state reps demand police reform. Otherwise continue protesting. Honestly, I've given expecting anything else. We're fucked, happened yet expect least people know contract COVID, maybe even die. Maybe even since wife essential personnel jobs contact public (I work hospital, works county government).

No one enforcing masks taking seriously. effected them, care. let 'em die off, effects people well.

Anyways, someone pretty much given hope, I'm looking forward collapse society inevitable death mask wars. Past performance guarantee future results. myth Swedish response COVID misunderstanding Swedish government society. People trusted look one another take precautions minimize spread COVID19. People voluntarily social distance, avoid crowded areas, go they're sick right thing do. Despite this, still higher death rate rest neighbors Percentages ***much less ambiguous*** without whole numbers (eg.15% 100 worse 25% 50). Safety goggles. kind fit glasses need reading glasses. Bought two pairs people figure they'll need there's run them.

They vents that's normal safety goggles (Google completely screwed ability type ""goggle""), got figure normal environment, odds enough viral load getting vents infect make sick minuscule.

Though guess go somewhere knew high viral load, I'd tape vents seal off.  big one, Tampa General Hospital? coughing January right left shelter place. Kids coming red-faced home week, kids sent home fevers. Usually, March, sick season over, going strong left. PTSD that, imagining go back, hear coughs, sniffling, throat clearing again. We’re leaving local municipalities individuals. individual responsibility. Ugh.  Trump claimed 99% Covid-19 cases 'harmless'. Florida getting remaining 1% seems? anyone believe Trump? Likewise Schools haven’t even figured it’s already 4 months - seems like urgency much red tape - absolute disaster infect ten people waits results. pandemic doesn’t fit, must acquit. literally tested record high Sweden definitely counted cases big time. took strategy matter intention crushing spread way countries doing. lack big test trace isolate system primary goal - especially they're well capable- fuolly tragedy. 

However accuracy death numbers would argue high. I've acknowledged many times here, despite dishonest commentators, issues delays jaggedness short term reports, rolling numbers weeks end better data countries. I'd wager one countries whose official Covid deaths within 10% actual Covid deaths. That’s system set up. contact local hospital's finance department sign programs grants have.

I recently found type program (I know exactly program is) local hospital billing department. got parts hospital bill covered Medicare reduced almost nothing.  want hold accountable Russian bounties too? Blasphemy!! compound that, right-wing news sources never report things like ICU capacity full would prove previous narrative wrong. people rejected science never learn consequences actions unless they're directly affected. design. It’s also affecting lab results non Covid stuff ! See Oxford scientists thoughts that. Meanwhile people eill act like req sort great conspiracy/mystery US coronavirus numbers blowing everyone else's water. 

Guarantee Uber drivers put shields US, we'll hear idiot freaks demands sit front tried tear shield. imagine Uber actually giving enough shit drivers passengers actually set places help drivers install them. forget military robots. many would go AWOL go defend family friends. realize military personal lives outside military. 
Last thing, huge chunk military specialized combat.. people never engaged actual combat work things combat heavy military. attenuated

Just clear, means reduced, eliminated. 95 N95 means, filters 95 % droplets small enough reach lungs. So, N95 respirator reduce virus dose tremendously. said, get choir 20 infected kids small classroom singing hour without masks, likely infected unless wearing full hazmat, occasional infected kid – hopefully – talk lot feeling bit unwell spread enough virus pertrude (is English word?) N95 mask.

I sources hand, read studies testing masks dummies, surgical masks filter ~ 80 %, cloth masks ~ 30 % bandanas less that. Correctly worn well fitted, course, meaning air flows side mask unfiltered mask face. Many masks leak nose, almost impossible get tight fit nose without wire. Great. lie dumb Americans reverse course... 

Oh could saw coming?!?!

It's top doctor CDC lied American public real life consequences... would thought!?! walked thru ICU last night rooms covid precautions sign door, necessarily mean conformed covid.

All ICUs expected least 60% full. Management hopes for.
 around 80%. usually close 60%.

Agree w last statement. covid patients home urgent care gets massive 55+ retirement communities it’s going death factory.

So far they've good keeping out, virus there, harder protect elderly. Yeah think point basically pointless. get tested symptoms showed. virus run course better hospital time gets results. 

On plus side saw others office suddenly reverse anti-mask thoughts. late, better nothing? I’m gonna go Canada. Imagine Bush, 9/11 gone: ""Chill people, 99.999% people gonna fine"" 1. Masks work. 
2. protect me, bother?
3. it, need wear one. 
4. already it, need wear one. 
5. Muh freedom.
6. can't conceal carry wear mask.
7. can't breathe bacteria make sick. 
8. like them. 
9. right to. 
10. makes hard eat/drink/smoke. 
11. comfortable. 
12. hot. 
13. I'll choke die CO2 poisoning. 
14. virus exist I'm wearing goofy looking face covering sign believe plandemic hoax.
15. forget put on. 
16. need exposed, flu anyway, want exposed immune worry anymore.

I wish kidding. Shit Japan day, level politeness cleanliness Japan fucking floored me, makes us look like dogshit comparison know see way healthcare hero too, thanks Im doctor. Im talk... stfu listen states open month half.  protests/riots/looting spiked.  leftists implant thought-dome buying narrative. moment, world wait throw parties again. need let go yesterday.

""no one ship"" obviously one really sick. went on..  everyone, mean entire population, people interested maintaining bubble? let wear garbage bags eat cake Thank you. fantastic. exactly saying. helps pm least thinks real   control group worse, terms health, already high-risk treated group? sure sub right place this, I’m looking see else going currently am, I’m seeking little advice. live South Georgia. county pretty big hotspot right now. work hospitality industry, resort reopened month ago. ton employees tested positive, leaders aren’t really much help. They’re looking healthy employees haven’t assigned go back work quite yet, cover sick. resort actually slammed, ton people holiday festivities. problem I’m worried returning contracting virus. I’m 28, live dad 74 two types cancer treatments, also smokes. refuse go back work, lose job unemployment benefits. go back, could bring back home dad. Anyone else dealing something similar? yes people guns probably care covid virus... Lmao sister law says big deal ... “masks nothing open everything back up” yup uh huh like Florida, idiot Fun fact:air bag systems cars made/meant us market deploy 6-8 times faster harder say, European market.
The reasoning is, Americans automatically presumed wearing seatbelts.... one tell us (at least us). 
This also airbags America injure sometimes kill people -scenarios. 
The impact sensors us market cars trigger airbag systems also set almost twice high speed euro market counterparts avoid activation said potentially injurious airbags lesser accidents (which Americans also presumed get often much better trained disciplined foreign counterpart drivers ). Subtle, subtle. think people issues beaches isolation. related activities could go along trip beach, may lead going restaurants, bars, parties social distancing prevalent/possible. ELI5 credit score basically every-time take debt get score linked social security number, score factors much total debt have, many accounts have, paid bill time. good credit score means people grant new debt without second look, bad credit score means people deny new debt without second look. Sad see went really game this.

Cross fingers Europe, see similar attitude around far over. done restart New York City. Wow, difference across imaginary line separating 2 governments. one side calm competent leadership gross incompetence leading ideology. method working better?  AMA request, ""real"" Gov DeSantis. come China steers clear US still shithole? Taking full responsibility, still planning reopen. Ok Fuck me. Iran gets it. North Korea gets it. Every country planet gets it. Except... america. fuck dumb selfish? family friend airlifted Houston Tomball hospital full. 32 years old pneumonia contracting covid, bad luck. stabilized crashed intubate, died next morning. Yes one chief reasons Japanese accepted worshipped Emperor 😣 That's always realistic even possible. State teacher retirement plans vary state state, general, retirement age 65 reduces one's pension, may even allowed teacher question 20-30 years service state. 

It's like teacher easily go different line work, either. struggle get taken seriously employers, even they're 65 older, like there's lot hiring going right anyway. 

I'm anyone, profession, afford retire take one team open job someone desperately needs one. everyone meets retirement eligibility rules able care pension they'll get leave now. 3 closest neighbors (one across me) parties weekend. 10-14 people each. also rained weekend mostly inside came huddle together fireworks. 

I saw pregnant women 2 parties. saw couple old getting car shocked driving. 

No masks. Also CRAZY fireworks. let 10 year old hold 2 lit Roman candles hands. 4 children 10 lighting fireworks time next fireworks already going off. laid like 12 fireworks street kids ran around lighting going off. cure can’t worse disease! lets something isn’t cure even worse! Choo choo multi-lockdowns! know it’s real. I’ve great uncle pass away it. numbers inflated. Big difference “Fail later stages development”???

What mean that? multiple vaccines already developed phase 3 testing.... downvoted it’s true reassuring, playing covid point best stupid I'm happy someone got it.... 25 days later made day, thanks. Yup, aunt symptoms tested positive. still thinks fake flu. Maybe someone study actual transmission beach. mean generally seems outdoors wearing masks lessons transmission haven’t seen published papers transmissions beach protest. live Newfoundland Labrador. Premier (a pharmacist training), Chief Medical Officer Health, Minister Health Community Services amazing keeping public informed. minister, Dr. Haggie, [has sharp think really resonated people. 

We small population (525k whole province 92% living island). Roughly half people live eastern part island. cases early March outbreak funeral home dozens people tested positive. sudden too, hard get people comply. 

Also, live St. John's, 76cm snow (~3 feet) one day back January, stay home order week back cleared away snow. like weird dress rehearsal rest 2020.  virus bad. sub seems like doom gloom echo chamber. People mention wind major factor outdoor transmission well documented thing, wind blowing direction another person? fair, city, several TSA agents tested positive. possible get going security. one TSA agents interacting thousands people every day. catch it, thousands people interacting someone it. tell going stores pubic outings going water away people. .. Choice stock photos... that? It’s seems like mixed messaging. Especially customer coworker worst meetings need still polite cordial even though person said something horrible. There's dog vaccine canine coronavirus. Till reason spend money developing human one. Colds suck kill people scar lungs. love it. I’m mostly level 1 help desk stuff right now, helping teachers get tech work right, configuring phones smart boards, etc.

The best alternative taking stairs living high density buildings, which... wholly feasible everyone. never national lockdown. media asking hospitals increase ICU bed capacity past months? Didn’t China build huge hospital little 10 days meet demand surge ICU capacity? knew day would come, didn’t demand help government assistance building emergency live Cali Blue City work really Red city see city social media. Blue city people concerned virus want kids go back schools soon far cautious. red city purposing like 3 days school split 2 online days something people arms 5 day school week like children going scared ever. horrifying, it?

Terrifying. brother works Houston delivery route. can't feed kids keep home stops working. one fully functioning lung. Also terrifying. wish best could. look like perfection course everyone stay home, best, think would get much better results. always true. Smallpox stayed pretty deadly throughout tenure. protests weren’t issue 98% people wore masks reduce transmission rates.

Do source this?, i'm sure many were, 98% seems like Also, think protesting basic human rights LITTLE important drinking Budweiser tanning

The virus care, matter reason news reporting outdoor transmission unlikely. deactivated Facebook. 

My feed much nonsense. Indeed, ask yourself, nation many ignorant, corrupt stupid, really greatest nation earth? 

Unlikely. seriously need start providing PTSD counseling, free charge, healthcare workers. Doctors nurses have;

- worked 80+ hours week harshest conditions
- watched far many people die.
- fought tooth nail keep others alive
- dealt letting families say goodbye lovedv ones except visep
- remain separated families
- triage patients decide lives dies meant before, COVID-19 may creating conditions may require ongoing future treatment.  body organs question include liver, kidneys, circulatory system etc. Prepare worst (assume case) hope best (look evidence)  Looks like good time find better apartment! hate live super cheap. Like we've ever given fuck ecosystems! Yeah every business air conditioning. Grocery stores, restaurants, every nonessential business people clamoring hang big groups. We’re well truly fucked America. Well, go far past, usually strong arguments opposing opinions discuss territorial issue. XD

For point Marca Hispanica entity precedes Catalonia. True, roots Catalonia counties Marca, debate IX century already cultural Catalonia, also geographically same. instance, Tarragona included Marca, yet none discuss part Catalonia.

Also, Crown Aragon split, Rousillon part Kingdom Mallorca, point think even back considered integral part Catalonia.

Anyway, fair know actual status Rousillon given France, maybe I'm simply wrong. :) products look for

—Trump, probably  heard voice Mona Lisa Sapperstein Hey fucking moron, sorry call fucking moron, places mentioned absolutely fucking fine. moron state that's problem.
Ok sorry asked husband watch ended enjoying it. wouldn’t watch he’d see live. dad enjoyed too. hear read ""droplets* 1 time, there's trouble! Also, since beginning Corona era, "" touch face"" FYI; every effing human touches face, accidentally! Dr Fauci , Scarf Lady , whole lot, completely worth Jack! welcome America. mention, states hadn’t opened soon, people followed guidelines, wouldn’t staring another shutdown. live Canada AC it’s definitely . averages 32 degrees Celsius (89.6 f) feels like 39 degrees Celsius (102.2 f). It’s super hot AC saving ass Unfortunately, schools.open, around world, September we're gonna second wave globally. going spread like wildfire children. We're gonna lockdown Xmas - mark words. “Harris County, Texas, Judge Lina Hidalgo (D) said Sunday state needs ""fundamentally rethink"" strategy dealing coronavirus outbreak must return stay-at-home order.”

At point, state going back “stay home” orders, AKA full lockdown solution get control again. 

Think Abbott raise white flag week? people works restaurants... airplane.. hospital. Teachers main affected. 

Most office workers working home now... many back work soon social distancing pointless? it’s airborne hours need distance others terms hours rather meters. Many different ways could take argument, one would loosely based peacefully assembling, public mask orders would null. wear us speech. fuck price fish? D614G less lethal mutation. mutation hit Italy imported NY. predominant strain. places heavy death dealing mutation. death rate lower right demographic infected. shitload young people still dying though. What? People bringing time wrong protest pandemic, people supposed **staying home**.  know lot people area want outdoors much summer. Partly cooped inside winter. guess see. 

But gone summertime laid rest. We've reached new low again... masks never really protecting yourself. masks protect others around case infected. Okay, here. Play along me.

You understand need receive dose one virus particle get infected, right? Dr. Erin Bromage estimates 1000 particles. 

Coughs sneezes generate many many times that. 

So... quantity particles from, say, cough, able contained cloth mask? least some, right?

Aerosolized particles may escape mask, many particles would be? 

Do see I'm getting at? mask reducing viral load air even contain every particle. know many aerosolized virus particles need inhale get sick. Maybe takes much longer stand next unmasked cough. hospitals anything increase ICU capacity?  

In NY Cuomo mandated hospitals increase ICU capacity 50%, achieved 100% increases.  

My brother works one larger local hospitals said converted lot currently lesser used floors ICU floors (supplemented ventilators). Looking situation objectively, many lives doctor worth pandemic? Decades schooling, thousands hours experience wide array knowledge saves many many lives. Compared Karen wanted haircut.

If doctors nurses wanna go strike get appropriate PPE, blame them. hero's. perpetuating system collapsed long ago. Drunk people dumb things? would’ve thought. work hospital part residency program. class every week. instructor pulls ""you unmask we're socially distanced"" bullshit every time when, actuality, aren't. also saying nonsense like ""don't believe everything hear"" every time someone brings increasing numbers ICUs reaching capacity. I've literally reached limit her. fuck Kentucky? fact want act like things fine reason things normal months. could sat home mid June, we'd hole. no, someone needed haircut early May literally nothing vaccine creation definitely can't understand science behind it, words worthless here.

Fauci optimistic early 2021 trials go planned, that's I'll hope for. That's shame. family goes Duck every year along group 20-40 people. older members either retired work home quarantine come back NE, almost younger members bowing out. We're taking seriously unfortunate, much better risking catching disease losing time work come back. Lol vaccine joke. Well, Japan 20k confirmed cases 127 million people, they've got control still. Look US man, 2.85 million cases 328 million. (unsubstantiated) rumors Japan hiding cases 2020 Tokyo olympics though. kill never alive begin longer schools pretend open normal harder fall be. 

The first hospitalized cafeteria worker going throw campus chaos, first student goes Covid stroke going cause panic parents wonder whether part conspiracy theorists they’ve latched onto part insanity.  Sure, I’m damn proud it. people don’t like report trouble trouble-makers. can’t follow sub rules, get reported kindly go elsewhere. getting treatment things b/c want catch COVID hospital? That's legit reason outside COVID. Apparently today’s game postponed player tested positive.  Alaska loophole come back haunt them... patient health care worker &amp; pandemic taking huge toll mental &amp; physical health. imagine people going through. heart breaks health care workers &amp; innocent patients. Yeah, there’s probably lot false positives. live Florida. Ain’t bad. need build wall across northern border want things get better. wife feel like asses, we've turned away several kids door asking Son come play. Sorry, sorry. ICU, doo doo doo.... know much, much, much lower CFR I'm Washington state took kid's Mom 8 days get results well. Seems almost pointless. Yeah helps know really bad places accidentally end there, like Leicester right now. take you’re familiar “people Walmart” inflammatory title part linked article. Furthermore, ""Masks important, enough"" opinion reporter Tom Bossert conclusion drawn report article based on. conclusion makes common sense, emphasizing title dishonest alarmist. Ok well he’s def clear let’s face lot people 40+ US co morbidity. It’s one thing younger folks apathetic idiotic someone approaching senior years. Bahahahahahaha actually study somewhere, I'm sure results highest death rate county, close 10% 200 day, falling deaths really positive. However, slight increase cases recently Michigan, see translates deaths, whether treating disease better/more young people getting infected. Good making choice interest children, interest teachers. choose distance learning, likely keep teachers building distance teaching.

Our District PA trying go 100% back normal, offer online Academy want (no in-between option). I'm already preparing kids get part online Academy. Despite seen friends awhile (outside Zoom calls), perfectly fine decision. Came trek jokes, stayed strippers remember good ol' days...

Aut0mod apparently like configuration exact words... also ranked one top 10 recruits history college football recruiting rankings?  Blame governor alllll cases fun putting faith bullshit data makes sooooo upset! someone works hospital Bay Area overworked. Last night sent 2 ICU covid rule floor, couple covid unit got 7 admissions pending covid. Ridiculous. easy use generous methods possible determine qualifies ""Covid death"". Yes is. Downtown Clearwater got used. extent think feared get used Exactly. never even hear someone cough news. may there's also data coming people going clinical studies post even mild infections, could internal damage done even amongst mild infection, lung scaring, kidney damage, stroke sometime past infection, potentially blood thickening. question becomes higher percentage people survive this, percentage sort internal damage? Caution still far best option. Living America, really get news part world. know, Indians might chugging away vaccine now. press report it. Otherwise, would Indian government agency (I think like FDA equivalent there) make claim vaccine August 15? suppose learn fucked bc CCP’s puppets  mass protests. outbreaks. He's day old spam account. Fuck that. logic completely broken.

 finally thing control!
Let's pack streets, beaches shopping malls again!

..have paying attention friends south? people problem adhering shirt shoe policies. could waiting government order business income interruption insurance. wearing masks.

There's different trying, willfully ignorant. Right fixed N95 masks anyways. They're 95% effective fit tested. efficiency drops 40% there's small gap. Might help protect individuals know use properly problem people wearing masks, ones wearing cloth instead. hope works, one hell risk taking.

And work, still absolutely cannot become norm India. Eventually, shortcut fail spectacularly Speak yourself. majority Americans disagree you. keep referencing economy know nothing about, based severity virus also know nothing about. worry, Stroud McCord behind :) Like broken record ""of least not."" Since 15 people 0 deaths. looking beyond nose next month trends are? Tell peaks stays. today. Hook go, I'll rub infected mucus right eyes. Dumbest comment I’ve read day. People nursing homes *sitting ducks.*

1. They’re interacting close contact multiple different people given day. people they’re *closest contact* (CNAs uncertified aides) often people work healthcare settings throughout week second even third jobs make ends meet likely anyone else general population pick spread virus. 

Many, most, nursing home residents people actually wearing masks due breathing concerns, wearing masks.

Finally, considering virus airborne close enough airborne treated whenever possible, people remain indoors 24/7 buildings HVAC systems filled people constantly indoors might actually *increased* risk getting this? 

Put thought comment next time. I'll say again- TEACHERS ALSO POLLED???

It's happening live to. one asking teachers feel. parents want want reasons safety. pulling all-nighter project due months ago That's problem. know number. big lesson northeast fall probably value setting separate “Covid Health system” manage Covid patients without halting medical services. society get better “locking down” isn’t disruptive. job forces interact people

Many people do. call essential workers. people still go grocery store, might medical needs necessitate doctor's visit, etc. Complete near complete quarantine privilege whose jobs/lives/financial circumstances allow it. blind fact everyone enjoys luxury. Yeah, people seem understand acceleration exponential growth. numbers look similar right now, we're flying past previous peak sign even trying slow. knows we'll three weeks. lmao People largely speak gym

I wish. There's always people trying make conversation gym (pre covid - back yet). Amen, brother. Office small talk something I’ve never understood enjoyed...I shit do! Lol would try reporting state’s department health. What? Bill Gates needs tried crimes humanity Maybe past, call non-emergency police line report business complying mask regulations, give number call OSHA file report. take name address business you. Thanks information. try follow closely super depressing.

Either way guess hurt call doc see. working. They've somehow managed talk IFR 0.26%. know. hard understand nonmaskers. . accidentally trigger nonmasker store today said niece ""I dont understand people dont look healthy arent wearing masks"". . . close enough hear 50% talking also wondered 70 years olds behind her. took personally. . triggered even like snow flake

 followed around store calling stupid know fucking with. confirm. Work one hospitals last night transferred 2 ICU severe breathing problems got 7 admissions covid pending floor. 12 hours. what? troll?

 im honestly asking whats hype? Reddit, google searchs news: new daily record. cases cases.. one ever seems talk deaths going up. Hell, State hasnt death month yet we're re-closing things? im generally trying find opinions whats up. 

But mean viewpoint differs guess im troll silenced Good them, professors older &amp; ""at risk group"" safe. absolutely cause spread. I'm going officials said look forward data, well. given told mass gatherings huge risk, think prudent dismiss protests causal spread clue. wear boots, eat them.

It well explain least part reason young people going often many seem care point risk calculus much exacerbating depression anxiety vs virus. mean, inspired lovely unifying speech made today? Lets play dumb game. Protesting what? wearing masks? COVID statistics: this, low vitamin correlates people poor sleep, major factor immune system's power. Good food, good sleep, exercise. Vitamin tell youre probably sleeping well getting enough exercise/sunlight national level emergency, requires national level response. first time ever great nation’s history, 50 states declared state emergency once. get administration? Empty nonsense promises virus miraculously disappearing, constant plugging drug that’s repeatedly study study found multiple agencies completely useless treating virus.

The man publicly admitted asked health officials slow testing.

And administration’s stance virus? Live it! Hey, old vulnerable people voted me: live it!

This far worst historical blunder nation’s history caused incalculable damage: worst unemployment numbers generation 20 MILLION lost jobs, worst ever loss US GDP, worst death tolls 120K lives lost, single biggest loss world standing since became super power. never attempt help states left bid critical PPE. I've gained similar skillset working pharmacy years. interact entitled idiots daily basis eventually get numb happily carry whatever may say do. I'd assume imply mask right? else apples apples  gonna end spending whole fuckin year locked home morons. public schools see reason enrollment would decline post COVID. Schools often get less 3% total community budget. city simply pulled police force funded community schools instead (they planning open fall). I’m really sure school settings would need change? NPR's funding come federal government. depends. rare disease, social anxiety introvert pandemic ready that's thing.

Asking people help save lives medical conditions disabilities put high risk exact opposite Holocaust considering people disabilities first targets Hitler's Germany. ...and riots. Alright. Florida count probable deaths deaths count medical examiner determined COVID. take day 2 months. Also, hospitals reached capacity, they've able reroute hospitals. hospitals reach surge capacity staff overwhelmed, deaths rise. Governor DeSantis says Florida open business! surprised facility work 50+ patient confirmed cases 20+ confirmed employee cases. got somehow didn’t horrible her. shit joke I’ve seen many patients die it. are, instance standing line morning get temperatures checked hospital. kind frustrated exhale muttered loudly, “Where hell people’s masks.” One uncomfortable shift feet. It’s hard! hospital gives us mask everyday. 

Then someone cleaning anesthesia machine case 1.5 feet face without mask on. wear N95 anesthesia geeze.

People eat hospital tiny breakrooms without masks. find separate area eat. Privilege display,folks! thought Iowa?  Maine here. We’re boat. Tourists pouring across southern border week. masks, self quarantine...nothing. believe hubris going painful reckoning soon.  Wouldn’t problem everyone else wore one well 👀 smart, you? Link YouTube channel? idea hardship relation Holocaust? Man, easy lives must lead.

Go read book expand mind pain difficulties others experience. same. Which, yet again, different recommending people don’t wear masks.

“World Health Organization officials Monday said still recommend people wear face masks unless sick Covid-19 caring someone sick.”

“""There specific evidence suggest wearing masks mass population potential benefit. fact, there's evidence suggest opposite misuse wearing mask properly fitting properly,"" Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director health emergencies program, said media briefing Geneva, Switzerland, Monday.“

You’re kidding, right? believe fucked mean I’m alt-right. considered exclusively alt-right talking point. it’s - it’s American Canadian experts well. Here’s another article, read, I’ll quote relevant part you: end March, Tam appeared dismissive mask use saying “most people haven’t learned use masks” “there need use mask well people.”
  
  Later said “putting mask asymptomatic person beneficial.”
   I’d guess combination new cases predominantly younger, better treatment plans/options, *not* seeding nursing homes covid positive people. 

A rise deaths feel inevitable though. think it’s average 19 days infection til death. delay reporting. Still remains seen much effect factors have. third circle Venn diagram people mind/love people smell like ass come Texas! We’ll give COVID-19. No, could emigrate anywhere else. 

The truth countries, still reruns Dynasty (instead ""El Norte"", movie depicts happens illegals US...).


It lie then, even lie now, that's information US.

Texas saw going NY, decided deride NY play politics make Fox News rounds, going ""YOU NEED OPPOSITE SAYING MARCH"". 

As someone Northeast, irritating. No, ill wait 2025 go outside  hitting 2,000 nerve racking, 11,000 hit apathy nerve feel pity people went pretending business usual. what? drink bar? new pair sneakers? stimulate economy shopping big box stores give fuck communities they're in? none take inward journey 3 months lockdowns think maybe certain things life matter? That's I'm this. Can't speak everyone else. Yep Ah well yes, thinking pre-pandemic. lines fireworks stands saw yesterday crazy. Zero masks. almost took photo post here. LA posting numbers today yesterday? artificially keeping numbers low July 4th? Fuck shithead G Uggghhh shut fuck already. get it. fucked up. anyone thinks still joke, I’m loss words. indoors. Hahahahahah say “restaurants death sentences” straight face don’t even know. You’re insane. Everybody wants small business nobody wants pay cost business. Hopefully provision comes California well. evidence suggest virus transmitted via takeout. still take precautions, far takeout delivery pretty want get damn haircut. apartment buildings-- stairwells elevators. agree Mr. Gates completely seeing efforts trampled idiots rather walk grave admit wrong giving hard time. Countries need honor doctors died thanks pandemic. Maybe build monument something. Virus wave 1 never end You’re obsessed $7k hardly excessive. legal fees fight case would vastly exceed amount. True, majority airbnb's, resorts, vacation rentals etc. CA.  Well, pray disease away! feel pain. I’m situation. read much, ehh? right tho gives right force wear something don’t want to. Can’t wait “just wait 2 weeks!” crowd hide embarrassment deaths continue low.

Here’s facts:

• IFR 40 practically zero

• know treat COVID better ever, improvements SOPs new drugs

• detecting asymptotic carriers make 80% cases

• important fact: longer sending Covid patients BACK NURSING HOMES. 40% US deaths happened nursing homes. real killer due idiotic policy. continue stay way Biden.  disappointed say think lying nurse.

I mean believe nurse, meant real nurse, someone practice according standards practice recognize position leadership, especially outside hospital people might look answers times, model responsible behaviour. seen enough people scrubs taking masks leave hospital know, firsthand, nurses concerned modeling responsible behavior.

Taking mask outdoors big deal. social distancing chances catching SARS-Cov2 incredibly small. would worst luck. definitely picnic wear claustrophobic mask becomes difficult breathe shift goes on. blame wanting take soon get example, I'm friendly nurse floor also happens sell use essential oils. Politely could, questioned homeopathic cures, ""Well, science know everything"" sort response.

Science actually many answers placebos work, essentially offering. unfortunate nurses pushing pseudoscience people. think representitive profession get religion, great deal nurses religious, sort literal way seen surgeons be.

Your far off. part woods basically Trump loving nurses religious rural backgrounds ignorant science push kinds pseudoscience. one 60 years old pushes 5G conspiracy theories. 

You also different types nurses basic practice training others like RNs recieved science based training degree. demonstrate ability analyze criticize journal articles. can't graduate RN without skillset.

In experience younger RNs religious fall pseudoscience. still slip cracks system. also depends part world nurses trained, training recieved when. worked older nurses became nurses way carpenter gets Journeyman license working nurse never going school. Many schools RNs little tolerance nurses can't follow evidence based practice. practice coming across many RNs promote pseudoscience, speak part world. I'm surrounded elite teaching hospitals. surprise nurses pushing pseudoscience parts America. since come across odd MD pushes pseudoscience, also surprised found higher concentration MDs quacks area well. couple legit questions.

I see people making comparison Covid-19 seasonal flu, ie; seasonal flu kills many (more) people, nobody shuts country etc. Therefore, worrying much Covid-19.

Question 1: many healthcare workers die year seasonal flu?

Question 2: percentage Americans get seasonal flu shot year?

Thank You. Ah, see. Well saying that's someone said chain responded to, consider ""my reasoning"", that's fair. Minor misunderstanding. I'm sorry loss. :( Made think comic Neither lockdowns. Enforcing technically unconstitutional. Nothing put place enforceable. solution compliance mask wearing distancing that’s like twisting arms. I'm jealous.

If serious wife taking 3 ICU patients every shift would questions. work major metropolitan area hospital midwest even two ICU patients (which pretty standard) much. wife getting shit hospital. see three ICU patients could safe days metro level ICU.

Hell that's default government officials start asking questions private life. contact lawyer.

As realizing Covid-19 exists, yes, absolutely does. give magical right compel people discuss private lives approve personal choices.

Would support tactic HIV crisis? government start compelling people law disclose everybody ever sexual contact they're within two steps known HIV carrier?

After all, HIV heck lot deadlier Covid-19. 

So measles. compel anti vaxers discuss private lives government?

I absolutely support quarantining sick people. forced government surveillance must always voluntary.

I’ll reframe said way might understand:

*I don’t give flying fuck Bill Gates, non-doctor, non-scientist, non-epidemiologist, non-elected official, non-anything care about: feelings hurt people free discussions social media. Right wrong, it’s place tell anyone think believe, blaming social media, put pressure outlets censor free speech open dialogue, incredibly dangerous slippery slope things far worse COVID-19.*

Then Japan's refusal heed advice World Health Organization (WHO) ""test, test, test"". Even now, total PCR tests stand 348,000, 0.27% Japan's population.

Nor Japan lockdown scale severity Europe. early April, government ordered state emergency. stay-at-home request voluntary. Non-essential businesses asked close, legal penalty refusing.”

When ready step bubble we're here.

Again people understanding truth running world. 2020 gone far, anyone thinks otherwise still stuck ignorant bubble. makes sad we're fighting ready wake join us.

Again stop listening mainstream media narrative. do, well, good luck. ❤ Yep, biggie. ...who’s dense 😂 also who’s rude... fact lockdown restrictions eased lot countries around world absolutely baffles me, people seriously beginning forget virus still rampant. Yeah curious staters rural CA folks ones coming treating like fake issue. Crazy hear Texas. remember back day would excited seeing Nevada license plates I'd go kid. Check grow potato laundry basket. Good amount calories, last months cured stored well, easy tiny outdoor space. ""Sorry fucking moron.""

-The media Seems like needed reworked couple presidents ago. Unfortunately, ""nurse"" also refer people Associate's (ADN) even practical nursing license (LPN), reserved people BSNs. CNAs (which takes anywhere zero eight weeks education/training, depending state) call nurses, well, although that's frowned upon actual nurses.

But there's definite spread education required able work nurse, something profession trying sort issues like this. area, every time search directions points back house. riding bikes pretty much every day since kid. single important thing I've shaped life around it. worth health someone else's health. zero risk. It’s actually healthy. one part.  song people saying that, refuse wear mask think pandemic hoax take vaccine agree points Doctors forgetting Oath, healthcare workers generally best situation they're in, fault.

But point... Yeah agree you, friends back February talking wished we'd get disease point likely die could get with. also admit wrong, ignorant, could take back anything would ignorant drivel spewing time, mostly id say 'it bad, another pandemic sensationalised media'. 

I already apologised friends family ignorance, known better that's me. Well duh. expect? totally believe would sent packing even earlier damn North Carolinians ;) article removed yesterday- Trump sub decided post this? comments different throwaway accounts?

This weekend record breaking traffic beaches -- 2019. That's good, got bill I'd pay file bankruptcy - I'm sure many end doing. course totally given containment measures; cannot restrict movement people (the primary vector far) outbreak zones.  would someone yell another person **wearing** mask? hit harder; higher percentage people virus(Which means herd immunity; changes infectiousness disease total), higher incidence mask use well social distancing.

You know correlation =/= causation right?

See thing outdoors lower transmission rate. said still pretty high things considered. know protests made huge difference.

That said: majority increase coming people states keeping guidelines actively going purpose.

The thing may getting is: trying say protests little effect biggest cause reopenings people following guidelines.

The second part statement true; majority increase due reopening people following guidelines; second biggest cause protests.

You think 99.5% X 0.5% Y. 60% X 40% Y. I'm American I've looking words describe goddamn day. nailed it. We've lost humanity. fucking lost cause point feels like. know say try make sure community survives this. love home family neighbors. want see through.

It makes furious honestly, though I'm violent person admit fantasy ran head seeing get beaten shitty people. currently COVID I’m really scared. everything supposed to. Stayed home. Haven’t seen friends months. Wore mask faithfully. Didn’t go anywhere work home. got it. explain. keep trying get across people. mild case always mean walk park.

People going wake wake unable go stairs without difficulty, unfortunately. There's half-decent chance vaccine doses then. depends Oxford vaccine gets on. idea flights. know Ireland never closed international links either out, though make publicly known. football fans delusional.

Most schools shut since early March. spring practice, offseason meetings, summer conditioning weights, shortened preseason camp. If, somehow, push forward fall football season, catastrophic injuries due diminished strength conditioning, poor execution due lack preparation. gather, uniform shut downs regions (so people traveling around get lockdown zones) 120% better healthcare employee protections U.S. And, last time checked, people France protesting wearing masks. protest everything there. 4 hours, amputate... Wow, people still trying sell nonsense? No, masks 100% solution. *mitigation*. stop larger droplets/particles people exhale.  Holy fuck that’s crazy. 3rd cases lol aged like milk. Texas Florida. actual fuck, cares wear mask need wtf people! Uhhhh yeah knew April... hence mask requirements every single country except USA Lol mean can’t dense think people argue social media majority right? that's funny twist put meaning ""wiped out"" then. Social media blame lot things. ayyy make chamber yassss many weeks wait deaths start rising? Lügenpresse = lying press, fake news

Concentration camps = ICE detention centers

Ghettos = maskholes align movement actually somewhat akin N*zi Germany. Projection much? coming directly government makes less credible, more. Report local health authority well. meet guy? Must universal dress code freedumbs. wouldn’t say it’s political, confirmation bias sub filled people take covid seriously. Shocking information statistics get upvoted, even they’re factually incorrect. see lot “oops numbers 30% higher reality, point remains”. Like Naa tell truth. dont dear to, especially passage called national security law ..... can't blame defending China best interest health freedom advising wanted make sure wouldnt shortages effecting needed (eg healthcare workers). 

I notice mentioned CDC longer say use masks. know this, implying facebook contradicting them? Daily Mail considered incredibly questionable source best? 

Anyway, guess feel like I'm position opinion matters bullshit health department executive test statistics contact tracing, trust sources say. 

It's fine skeptical, like say ""I believe that"" presented data. sad, cannot tell what’s crazy idea what’s anymore.

Did originate viral lab wuhan? accidentally released?

I mean possible. don’t know though feel confident scientists prove virus found naturally.

I idea, I’m convinced standard narrative.

I think situation weaponized misinformation campaigns. confusion people isn’t “random”.

I believe adversaries helping. qualifications listen? 

I'm profiting rona bullshit. Bill gates is. See difference. find hard believe. work health care face face many covid positive patients. well coworkers. one time 35 positive patients hospital. Unless intubated wearing N95. far outbreaks scenarios like this? total 50 health care workers tested positive hospital. Many patients flagged precautions covid came back positive days later. number positive health care workers would much higher traveled air. Campaign ad scrolling list names people died Trump's face background. pharmaceutical company financial incentive exaggerate product increase stock price sales. Indian government hand, concerns. Indian government also concerned reputation, make statements carelessly. statement government credible. family super everything conspiracies new age garbage, even wear mask necessary. even virus (so far). Indeed...IF people it. last lockdown here...cell phone data showed like maybe 60% did...which reason we're position now. right life trumps liberties. Refusing wear mask public, pandemic claimed 130,000 lives country alone, different directly killing man. 

Your rights end interfere rights others. Don’t like it? Go live woods away society. weird? Nurses emts direct contact patients. knew exactly where. 

Take passive aggressive tone visage boi know that, couldn’t read lines? we’re admitting flaws, people mad about, talking about, highest percent positive? 

You admitted highest percent positive doesn’t mean anything terms virus, terms testing. Well doctorate so... Informing volunteers ethical issue mind, mean giving full information would beyond unethical, would criminal.

If speeding results could solved simply expanding normal trials kid got accident come school. finally came back hair turned black bright white. ""Whose fault this?"" I'd rather edgy run around screaming sky falling. I'm part social distance, wear mask public that, overwhelming majority people survive this, fact. Sorry disappoint you. Managing spread SA seems impossibly difficult regardless government policies.

The townships hundreds thousands upwards million people living extremely dense communities limited access running water, sewage/waste management, electricity many residents.

The wealthier areas may able follow government guidelines, good portion total population lives sorts communities official guidelines would difficult comply regardless enforcement.

The best move imagine would ship millions masks hand sanitizer given lack running water many.

The rate cases deaths difficult track, think... Florida need calm fuck down. terrifying rest us. put face name, makes even sad. Fuck piece shit virus people emboldened making political thing.  need real statistics this. many doctors died? many nurses? 

how essential workers? bet many cashiers working groceries died. them? healthcare workers died year far officers died someone else job... last 9 years. Make want. Ok. 63,000 morte. many otherwise preventable deaths overpaid careless US doctors caused since official state Coronavirus? 

I'd bet solid double digit percentage deaths attributed covid actually preventable errors made US's notoriously careless healthcare providers. 

For record doctors healthcare workers US systemically severely under-paid. let's clear, culture carelessness. people make mistakes much higher rate find anywhere else world. Anyone first hand experience US's healthcare system, outside elitist enclaves, like instance say Kaiser Permanete, know I'm talking about. Carbon fiber masks dope exhaust outputs. Slick...light weight...zoom zoom. myth Tetanus shots? Kenyan government, UNICEF, insist vaccine hCG levels would influence fertility. Even true hCG levels high (which they're not), would short-term effect. vaccinating tetanus tetanus kills enormous number Kenyan babies, vaccinated mother provide protection baby maternal blood supply. takes incredibly warped delusional mind think three entities secretly conspiring harm women. Plus, backed evidence. Please stop treading workers. fuck letting flights Brazil? bad. throw back... nice 2020 Really bizarre shit going ole U you’d vote pedophile?? really makes sense going school year state in. see 100 plus kids classroom day. simple fact pandemic basically means covid room soon. Texas spirals control i'm already calling year loss. open enrollment coming up. bet ass i'm jumping higher tier health life insurance. hope family need shockingly vile exactly would expect blood-sucking fucktards seem run every business. references song called little houses believe written Pete Seeger? unit lost skilled respected nurse least 2-3 weeks tested positive. already shorthanded. It’s huge blow staffing wise kept everyone afloat aside herself. People means spare. rich. keep seeing quoted it’s basically garbage nobody 65 could get test April. course average age cases went down. last line comment hit real hard.

I’m Florida speak area lot family members working hospitals area woefully unprepared busy day ER let alone spike cases. area I’m hit hard yet tell hospitals insanely understaffed stocked turnover insane. regularly see ER wait times go 15min 90min slightly busy day. sizable spike cases 4 hospitals area crumble. wife charge nurse running cardiac floor left stay home daughter would say 40% time stocked crash cart floor. Nurses going patient count daily basis (from 7 10 11) 1 sitter watch 7-10 high risk patients, 1 CNA 35 patients. floor even mentioning times ICU ER running grab supplies floor ran out, god sakes wouldn’t spend money pens nurses doctors. would hate see happens institutions stressed magnitude ran anything like place. hospital week appendicitis 20 years ago. want know parents spent that. Nobody wants small business California haha. love state many things absolutely brutal run small business CA. Whelp time start distilling chloroform. surgery...... I'm totally doctor.....

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  ""BUT DEATH RATE STILL LOW!""

Hospitals filling up, people taken beds sent home. Cancer treatments need cancelled. People die. excess deaths people much considered indirect casualties pandemic. 

We've gotten bit better treating Covid, means nothing shit fills up, staff gets sick, resources get thinned out. 

The entire purpose flattening curve overwhelm hospitals. Well that's happening, what? Keep clinging onto dying narratives ""You see 17 deaths today! bad!""? Dude, it’s infuriating many people legitimately believe argument “eroding resistance random orders.” 

Like, one day tell us wear masks, next we’re forced go work naked government mandated wolf tail butt plugs. 

Do people understand taking precautions pandemic isn’t real totalitarianism? Honestly, fucking privilege think authoritative government looks like. I’m 19, I’ve secretly wanting grid like 5-6 years now. It’s exactly easiest thing you’re younger I’m boat, really wish leave one day it. Nothing sounds better. I’m hopeful something come together eventually. still waiting 28 Months Later. logical find correlation protests large groups people closely associating rise cases?  Florida mountains edgy. cannot roll eyes hard enough people like you. agree much him. want others listen you, also listen Bill. equal amount say. whole idea casino general public really really really bad calculating odds :) certainly know that. blatantly unconstitutional even layman. point make risky average person deal it, hope spike cases ends court gets it. lived UK, idea even saying food unless wealthy live London go nice restos there. dont know compare food UK city like Houston, NYC, LA. Incredibly diverse authentic meals world, sometimes fusion twists modern takes classics. food scene cities absolutely incredible. Indian food best food UK.  told many many tough non-mask wearing folk anyone elderly fine. Could wrong? hospital anthem week: That’s perfect storm wrong it’s hard believe it’s real. happens flu every year..../s makes sense – wouldn’t surprised IFR doubles regions healthcare systems overwhelmed. depends insurance. go ER pay 50, surgeries last couple years costed 10 each. 

I know employer pay nose plan, turn salary always couple K lower competitiors. That's one biggest draw company, benefits good. people ICU don’t coronavirus have? It’s flu season so... what’s next biggest thing? St Luke’s name national guard made ready use April it’s stand open hit capacity Yang simple immediate solutions would allow us time refine country about. Cool I’m concerned terrible complications outlast infection keep service, violate rights day. think makes sense one way links Brazil. another way, I'm convinced matters much, given pubs reopening, expect come fairly sizable spike cases. UK keep pub spike manageable, travel rules pretty sensible way keep new infections coming in. know smart move, wonder plan enforce it? Rich people pay fine spew virus over. intended mainly curb travelers hotspots? point actions make difference government let get control. may well avoid homelessness rather seek purpose, relief anyone, heart, understanding. Zika.  demonstrated interests support few. lost much credibility Anti- maskers. Hmmmmmphh offense but

im sure many us already prepped bedrooms tombs....

i have. states tell install systems filter virus schools? know % among new cases 60yr+ group? Thanks Florida damn terrified. assholes don’t give two shits anything. It’s heartbreaking frustrating. Half people still won’t wear masks.

Even mortality 2% means hiding tons cases, least city hard get tested unless almost dying refuse test. Selfish privileged piece shit dicks. concern trolling tiresome. id rather die.... Lmao thats great Almost makes want believe dying better debt. 🇺🇸  Google this! guys know want keep dicks. gotta remember aren’t merely losing soldier healthcare workers die.

Wearing mask weeks/months 99.5 percent survivable !!! woman flew country fewer 1000 active cases 30 million people, tested negative Covid.

Chances 'back' due case astonomically low, zero. Hence officers quarantine. know teenage girls recourse abuse.

When worked ice cream shop, owner said power ask anyone leave.

Never used it. nice know it. place ever worked said that. It’s going take beds throw don’t get act together.

So saying we're gonna need shitload beds.... right, thank goodness that, thing preventing lot people getting coronavirus. *are* seals, that's obviously unrelated virus, since takes time breed grow :p Afaik population trippled since 2005? I've read article German weeks ago can't find it.

This article talks spotting seals far tell, probably beaches are/where mostly empty. Lol, mask doing? Contagion favorite movie. Yet contempt goes away people want police something think important. Masks police issue US never be. time community solutions people protesting take place. don’t think community wearing enough masks organize community members come community specific solution. Lol? know people concerned ICU occupancy, level attrition among healthcare workers? Based what's publicly known New York, information much staff members hospitals lost due COVID either dying incapacitated unable work anymore? recall one point talk calling back retirees graduating medical students early reinforce medical services either USA Europe believe.  4 5 support mandatory masks! people? space aliens?

'Tis beyond power.  offense Hillary she’s reputable source infectious disease control. It’s news celebrity spews uneducated opinion current events, even happen right.

You realize literally care think right? hope Trump's economy worth him, don't. first movie watched pandemic declaration Shaun Dead.

I found oddly comforting especially part wake following morning. think every day. Well put “If charged COVID Act, maximum penalty six months imprisonment $A3,766 fine.”

Well, go charge make example her. pretty cut dried. even nurse though? I’ve noticed people assume person takes blood pressure intake nurse, time it’s medical assistant family practitioners etc don’t even nurses offices.

I’ve also noticed people think anyone scrubs room hospital that’s MD nurse also... far true. Trump is? wonder many die flu every year. 2nd amendment say anything masks Mr archives. laws passed fact find another bullshit excuse. 3500 cases daily Santiago feels normal

Everything feels normal overtime. ratio infected people around 1:20. infected people apartment building big deal all. Half concierges infected recoveter well. Fuck, sorry loss. sounds like true hero. I'm currently nursing school get BSN nurses like father look to. RN's give better others. figured effectively decrease transmission. fucking mysterious. don't.

Sure hope complications, gosh would worst! ask think taking precautions ? think government wants “collapse civilization?” 🙃 Australia New Zealand social media Americans. ;) hahahaha Plenty people fully recover, never even realized virus. also reason believe many people currently suffering long-term impacts won’t eventually heal. Post-covid syndromes real concern, like deaths don’t exact stats know don’t impact everyone. mean, comply penalty. Penalty penalty, hmmm, wonder one harder deal with? Damn, rocket scientist something figure hard decision also freed shit town. Leave soon don’t look back. parents died longer go back.

You could help unwaveing allies US offering Americans easier paths western countries really care. Ad hominems insults. Keep up. 👍

Did *really* think Catholics black native peoples mind? Well election today hopefully something change pay that? Seriously. Fuck that, leave 'em alone. choose wear mask. dont wear deodorant work im getting absolutely disgusting sweaty. feel healthier quite honestly. It’s clear idea you’re talking about. Thank you. poor EU country mom spent three weeks hospital another 4 home cost nothing extra. even joked saved lot money. Same. sad see others seem care. like apocalyptic books. life taught child house cards collapse moment. kind. Take care yourself, family others. expect anything grateful blessings. British Columbian who's laid barely left house since March, pisses greatly. wife used eat probably half meals, meals home leftovers sandwich.

We eat all, takeout, delivery, nothing March 2nd got deliver favorite place anniversary June 8th.

We discovered really like cooking, money savings goes along (even raising grocery prices). thought hated cooking, really hated cooking like mothers grandmothers. typical Meat, two veggies bread kinda meal. ton work gets every dish house dirty. found tons great easy recipes make much mess love cook.

I'm saying I'll never go back restaurant things normal day. pretty rare think.

Obviously current situation horrible. done wonders health bank account. Mass exodus must scold western media use words.

Beijing's soft lockdown, citizens make weeks sacrifices travel cities prevent spread epidemic

Confirmed cases single digits several days.

The core area still soft lockdown can't get city.

Beijing divided cordoned areas high, medium low, low-risk areas allowed city

Travel demand, suppressed three weeks, released concentrated manner, Western media used term ""Mass exodus.""

I'd say Beijing's standards, United States would still mandatory blockade right now. let small businesses make decision they're desperate happens. need actual leadership fine people competing gets help stranger ; ) Yes. Jonathan Haidt wrote ""Righteous Mind"" gives scientific, opinion unbiased, description liberal conservative mindset similar different. 

Many people think 'the side' made morons. true. also true always merit arguments sides. Often bonkers people come justify position. Naturally see much easier ""their side"". Good. weeks hope see decrease then, Imagine back march april. would've  now.

USA lousy 2 week ""lockdown"" (if even call that) rest world serius strict lockdowns.

Is rest world it? No, MUCH better could've without lockdowns.

You keep blaming trump, governors politicians never take responsibility actions, like children. never fault, 'big mans"" fault.

You might come back say ""buuut, responsible taking precautions, everyone else doesn't"". met friend laat couple weeks KNOW responsible? probably have. tell fuck off, going risk it? Nope, complacent ignorant.

Please dont take personally, general ""you"" I'm talking about. mean profitable. Jesus Christ can’t Oh, actually disputing common are. semantics, think original commenter meant everywhere. response either way: underestimate selective social circles really are, possible commenter vastly different experiences this. That's social sciences come in, I'd love see actual numbers this. think interesting. 

Also, sorry getting involved first place, pretty drunk last night often makes really passionate specific things, like semantics, statistics, whole lot things.. Yup, we've ticketing people American plates stopped see sights Banff/Jasper National Parks (we allow enter drive back Alaska strictly ""head directly there""). new swine flu even infected human make pretty good educated guesses daily deaths actually end peaking 2 weeks, don’t think it’s early all.

Florida: 60-70 daily deaths.
Texas: 50-60 dd.
Arizona: 45-55 dd.

I’ve heard plenty people say Floridas daily deaths close New Yorks peak, ia horribly wrong. Again, shared Facebook hopes uncooperative friends see it. 


It’s “if get coronavirus, I’ll probably survive.” 

It’s “if get coronavirus, might spread others might get sick put strain medical system.” 

People’s decision work stop spread personally. It’s everyone else. haha accurate public drinking bars/pubs public gambling casinos/card houses super dangerous need closed over. 

the first chemically lowering inhibitions increasing social urges (don't forget increased shouting, singing, slurring - mmmm, droplets). second literally activity monetizing people addicted taking dumb risks. addiction e people need work better/normal Europe, kangaroos vaccine researchers advanced. must expect one long January 2021, sooner. distinguish point effectiveness social distancing measures reduced transmission due huge set people (including many social) contracting removing social graph, though? seems like key question me. understand people seem open idea much Europe may reached something akin herd immunity scientific estimates antibody prevalence required herd immunity vary widely (as low 10-20% least one model depending variability social connectedness, ignores cross-reactive cell resistance scientists estimate 40-80% population has).

It looks like London opening up. Ought telling. arrested trespassing ban life Costco. membership store it'd trivial rescind membership forever. met people think drinking alcohol protect e coli similar diseases. Hm wonder that, I’d expect they’d need results heard places taking awhile get results. per capita standpoint, first countries googled would deaths US populations equal. comparison, US 132,000 deaths right now.

UK - 220,000

Spain - 200,000

Italy - 187,000

Sweden - 162,000

Ireland - 115,000 (about even US)

Belgium - 300,000 Look I'm still fuming Ireland closed airports US tbh. 200 active cases right now, dont need fucking pretri dish flying across Atlantic. missed point. comparison morality aspect irrelevant, hypocrisy. hard stay hotel watch TV day 14 days lives line?! heck comment extra beds seen waste removed system? comment praise (now severely hollowed out) NHS model?

Also yet another comment fundamentally misunderstands impact death lagging indicator data. England's cases much past, US huge upswell newer cases frankly 1) younger less likely die also 2) new deaths showing data yet. one pays taxes? want richest man graveyard, want? Stuff like legal fees usually covered. least ADA EOEC. US conducting 400,000-500,000 tests per day population one-quarter size India's. know US promised land settling everything court sometimes looks absurd us watching outside. would hope though would deterrent cases like these, someone working healthcare gets infected dies known disease request protective equipment denied. way US behaves currently increases risk levels us anything make people take (and future) pandemics seriously. Negligence health care sector simply beyond comprehension situation bad there, must many times worse sectors society. Living Tokyo. places regular due commute (Shinjuku, Nakano, Minato-ku), seems actually (people wear masks, old-time local restaurants bars still packed business-as-usual).

While people definitely wearing masks, social distancing especially small cramped restaurants bars really carried out; avoid places obvious reasons:

* Can't really wear masks eating/drinking, mask rules go window right bat
* Cramped confined space, susceptible poor air ventilation therefore high chance contamination infection, also higher viral load.
* people get rowdy drinks, accidents bound happen. appreciate that. something buy goes company donates cause candidate like, buy it.

This radical idea He’s showing rationality virus probably finally reached undeniable concerning levels country. Don’t understand think mask protect others. Almost ones gets it’s supposed stop others getting sick you. Id imagine you’re negative person normal day. Even pandemic. I’d work that. common test, reads antibodies determines whether EVER it. still, doctor tells someone died wasn’t covid, believe them. in, hospitals US many countries get incentives say Covid. get funding. Report health dept feel bad now. thought somehow dickhead went fucked guys over. Hopefully someone nailed foot floor quarantine over. “airborne” protected mask compared “droplet.” I’m still mask camp, airborne transmission way effective getting another host droplet. kidding? want hear gloomers then.  Accoring Donald Trump: ""Victory!"" No, it’s nice working much able go hikes walks beach. beaches spacious doesn’t feel unsafe. Get go live life mask social distance. Go picnic get tan Honest question, vote, know *how much* masks helps, *versus* staying home, keeping distance, washing hands? studie results yet?

In Denmark officials advices *against* using masks. 

They said harm, proof helps *avoid getting* infected. 

Instead practice staying home still keep social distance. 
Only 50 people gatherings *allowed*. 
(If gather more, person fined blue number tests, red number Drunk people can't act responsible yet majority people thanks acting responsible.

Shit take. sick, stay home. disease going around uncontrolled like flu colds, R0 would probably 3-7. very, high. question Aussie travels US lot (well recently): much attitude think tipping culture? Australia workers like would given good salary tips seem dumping ground angry people much. Yes that’s true, though it’s legislation legal terms. far constitutional rights I’m referring window lickers trying apply America’s constitutional rights realising difference legal systems. MTV generation will... Also spread camps easily spread urban cities. One guard catches takes home family, spread neighbors, etc. People suck. Bay Area California can’t go stores anywhere without masks. People seem complying. Sucks know many aren’t itll keep going going. Going herd immunity route US would collapse healthcare system kill hundreds thousands millions. Even could keep infections low enough prevent collapse healthcare, would take years reach herd immunity. may even possible get herd immunity without help infectious disease epidemiologists, wish state clearly herd immunity COVID-19 achieved population level 2020, barring public health Anyone puts others risks. Trump rallies, BLM, people bars, etc. virus care ideology. people still think it’s “myth” smh I'm saying assuming covid gone within year 2, right cold flu like symptoms take 2 weeks minimum work.

Assuming rule longer place covid-19 gone world staying home anytime catch cold feasible, get paid sick days work able afford take time like that. Wearing mask keeping distance others would best could do. Yes, alcohol common sense ancient antagonistics. wearing masks? doubt Sweden fighting like Americans. UK population US, they'd 220,000 deaths per capita comparison.

You know wtf talking about. Jess, Bit Europe's highest death rates among elderly. Nobody could predicted Sorry Kiwi Bros, Aussie, feel free throw fucking book her. 🥇 take chinese fraudulent reddit gold mean guess gonna ignore CDC source says 14 days +- 7 SD? Aight.

You also factor delay symptom onset reported positive test, probably around 5 days. 

Time seek care: &lt;= 2 days: 35%, 3-7 days: 50%, 8 days: 25%, + delay positive test positive test reported

I'd say average delay reported case reported death around 20 days +- 5 days IQR.

I'm fairly confident predictions guess we'll see. person delivering virus, there's absolute possibility one person transmit virus another. sadly mistaken quarantine lifted. However, required get test within 72 hours flight. 1 thousand per 10 Hundred! Could allergies dehydration. get tested. one online diagnose think Australia Europe. Yea calculated Russian stats looked must ravaged virus.


Good time someone invade bet. Australia constitution, pretty small one too, fits small booklet much larger pamphlet. mostly federal government supposed operate. learnt high school

Shows people know ""constitutional rights"" It’s hotter lately maybe he’s getting dehydration headaches allergies. allergies bad year new kind crotch demon? true, obese much likely suffer complications. sully good name warrior bear false equivalence. disrespect memory. Wojtek would ashamed. wondered Utah's low death rate. saw local Southwest public health department post reasons put COVID cause death. saw someone knew years ago passed away remembered death certificates accurate Utah, especially Southern Utah. winders. people know(I unaware moved here) government nuclear testing years ago taken responsibility causing many kinds cancers area. person terminal cancer COVID COVID written down, family lose money might pay medical care gotten. mean deaths properly labelled cancer, person sick years known terminal form labelled COVID positive? debate. heath department labeling cancer. tend think labelled cancer watching mother law die. never hospital besides babies helping clean house felt dizzy 3 weeks later dead aggressive form cancer caused nuclear testing. also shocked within 3 weeks still alive government already contacted giving money paid care full. adult disabled son took care money used set care him. see people demanding cancer put cause. money cancers need counted, make sure people get care need get doctors testing area. 

Now heard opposite story family member nursing home. put COVID death certificate someone end stages cancer. guess like masks, schools, rules, like 50 different sets rules. Let's hope liquor strong enough kill virus /s lag Vitamin D, causes overreaction immun system Cytokin storm. Also high body fat levels play big role severe cases. people less education eating unhealthy become often obesse. Sadly black communities often social bad environments caused non fair society.

but mechanism covid 19 complex lots things play role. think take long time ""fully"" understand everything works relating immun reaction, social circumstances preconditions genes. nothing stopping now. spread reported, Trump fans deny spread further.

What plan B US ruined beyond repair? sick stay home! positive news.... Honestly positive news Ive heard since shit began Oxford vaccine. 

Thats it. Lol. False positives extremely rare. Like rare they're barely statistically relevant. False negatives hand known since February, places like Korea tested people 6 times period two weeks. dude spewing virus right now, bet it. Yes. US site majority US users. Quick say much they're patriots yet end fellow citizens' lives infecting covid. Entitled fucks. culture worships cow pretty much shows country state it’s lol agree you, whatever worth. I’m sf Bay Area didn’t care seems everyone’s wearing masks. Doesn’t seem like it’s big deal wear one ones resisting. go small towns I’m sure taking less serious. surprise anyone. know blame. American dream. can't look number tests alone. India conducts 250,000 tests day. positivity rate 6% tests conducted daily results positives. That's lower US's 8%. means person US higher chances CoViD. US conducting tests. pandemic scares crap two reasons: 
1. (I'm young probably going kill me, want permanent organ damage).
2. want infect vulnerable people. He: tested positive ICU got cured covid tested negative lungs damaged covid keept ICU died lungs damaged months admited

He's saying never Covid, man died, months after, cured Well slightly topic, kinda like going post bunch dumb fucks Texas refusing wear masks leading yeah poor Muslim babies lot bombed death middle East. Pretty sure downvotes would come pretty quick that. See? COVID all! They're tacking diagnosis onto patients already there! /s can’t see eating inside restaurant year vaccine out. experience meaningless get food ordered out.

When drive past packed Applebee’s makes want vomit. Lack social distancing. Masks part equation literature still says distancing even important. one these, kick ass place business...

think voting Tr..p 🤐📃😂🍀😷✌️ good not. Medicare would cost americans less. tax private insurance premiums deductibles would less overall. Blurg! can't believe questioned can't say I'm surprised interessting read. Im looking forward studies. Props guy. Failed fighter. Failed comic. relevant though sucks Joe Rogans dick well. belong medical family - siblings mother nurses, consequently friends well. work predominantly northern NJ, one hotspots COVID. know there's way express mind-numbing fear months something might happen them, going work myself. younger sister one earlier COVID cases, hospital even allowing swear surgical masks unless patient either tested confirmed COVID. wiped coworkers; exposed multiple times, course would go patient rooms tested, strictly told allowed PPE. ran masks, gowns, hand sanitizer. wiped families. coworker got COVID living parents, got well. multiple members families ICU time. Families lost multiple members within days other. hospital suppressed telling anyone exposed refused facilitate testing employees; presume want confirmed tests reflect institution. 


Every day, would get another message dire situation nobody help, sheer hopelessness. would hear 5 vented COVID patients 1 nurse ICU, many nurses ill. would hear another friend tested positive. would sit phone listen struggle breathe beg go hospital. Then, deaths, one another, family friends dedicated lives profession. Nurses, doctors, unit coordinators. seemed everyone knew dying it.  


For everyone taking seriously, everyone whose stopped wearing masks celebrating holiday, wish could make understood enormity loss - absolutely beautiful, passionate, awe-inspiring people died alone past months, trying jobs. failed everyone - hospital administration, government, community degree. friends profile site, appreciate sentiment behind it. know would've too. Dude, parallel universe in? nurse almost certainly incompetent, but...

I'm pro-vaccines, flu shots much different rest. Europe, flu shots strongly recommended old immunocompromised.

For example, long ago got smallpox vaccinations (and scar prove it!) gave almost 100% protection smallpox long time. Mumps, rubella, polio - vaccinations give nearly 100% protection decades rest life.

By contrast, today's flu shot gives little 50% protection year. also decreases severity length flu get it. valuable - valuable old immunocompromised - order magnitude effect.

The low effectiveness rate also means herd immunity flu impossible marginal value single vaccinated person society almost literally zero. contrast, get close herd immunity, marginal value single vaccinated person extremely high, ""cheating"" extremely expensive, vaccination laws places.

Again, back Europe - generally, getting vaccinated MMR/TB/polio, etc criminal act here, flu vaccinations choice. means, least Netherlands, faceless bureaucrats spent years studying medical statistics crunched numbers made recommendation based complete medical records every single Dutch person decades. (Coming US, took long time realize faceless bureaucrats usually competent, dedicated professionals.)

---

So ""flu shots different"".

That said, think almost certain nurse incompetent. pointed above, flu shots _do_ value (and yes, minor costs too). competent professional would point advantages, downsides, allow patient make mind.

Also, great deal depends life. going get flu shot year work home get food delivered (right farmers, run food cooperative! almost plastic wrap! Seasonal local veggies! one good thing COVID brought us). Aside wife, see _zero_ people given week.

If teaching kindergarten, would entirely different story. Wat Businesses put sign constitutional rights end door. employees deserve abuse. know particularly stressful, maybe actually dangerous time, employing kids? Give dangerous job adult stop putting children firing line. I'm guessing cheaper pay. employ kids money saving option, really taking care them. say would need ration. Wow, thought knew February Thank wearing mask despite anxiety. heroic. world made boomers. Utter Yea went bike ride kill right? Get grip Karl.



Since calling someone Cunt = Wanting kill him? Oh making joke. Trump worst president ever White Supremacist. U.S .A stuck arse everyone March . U reap u sow ...Have perfect day ! ...Happy Xmas...lol.. Rule number one: idiot!

Allways check rooms, allways wear mask. I'm quite aware asymptomatic transmission. example, brother assisted living (at age 40), got tested one housemates got sick. one is/was showing symptoms, everyone house tested ""efficiency"" fuckin' dumb

Trust me, government bureaucracy efficient. No, I’m total agreement you. We’ve done thing. way report him, maybe is, would. Best wishes. They're medical terms actual definitions. Look ""Droplet precautions"" vs ""airborne precautions"" etc Welcome america family goes Oak Island every year big family vacation. We're talking 15+ people. They've determined ain't lettin' little thing like stop them. single person family taking seriously keep getting guilt-tripped unsafe gatherings them, mostly grandfather extremely vulnerable expecting live much longer. Gotta make rents go down. I'm sure everyone hospital good laugh grievous error judgement. Aerosol mean smaller particles... No? experienced complete lack safety working bar yesterday would like make clear government now, ever, certainly covered hands blood coronavirus victims. 

The bar worked third worst hit COVID 19 borough London PURPOSELY bare minimum open 'safely', word would use, made wear gloves subtly communicated worn PPE needed. This, assume, deter customers. server, came contact maybe 200 people last night 15 hour period - bar work small capacity now, floor working (one two) could around 50 people maximum, eight 'socially distanced' tables many seats around possible.

Customers told come bar, middleman - bringing drinks them, meant bar need covered protective barriers. made sure used sanitiser much possible, customers care close came - even touching me, almost impossible stop times many people drunk got seats. People kicked out, even caught stealing small decorative items. one way system ignored hard enforce, customers would purposely get seats try join groups, time succeeding. also came bar got impatient reduced service, happened far many times. like breeding ground virus outbreak. 

The owners clearly trying make much money possible long period shut down, even seating socially distanced, volume drunk, careless customers much control, definitely chose trade safety profit. think always going clear would tough day pub reopening absolute done keep safety priority. Customers also got drunk seemed care anything. Staff overwhelmed end gave trying maintain proper procedures. bar anything go by, UK lockdown week. 22 year old nurse ecmo 2 months. lived, she’s going need new lungs. That’s something aren’t counting. Really? $5,000 twenty years ago. $1500 midwife home. 

Hospital covered insurance. Midwife covered pocket. Amazon profits trebled since 1st March. Almost everyone Europe Asia ordering food, domestic goods clothing e-commerce. Amazon top list. Vivo made China definitely does. That's true, masks almost makes bearable look at:) I'd like think I'm single-issue voter, election, pretty much pro-mask vs. anti-mask. know someone really qualifies ""rich"" would complain spending thousands health care call apartment ""expensive fuck"" reddit  expect nouthing lesa Actually rich suffered Black Death. labor force died nobody tend vast lands. poorer survived benefitted most, food labor scarce pay went up. Idiot. looking picture, seems plenty space social distancing. health risk stupid behavior Asymptomatic transmission. understand lagging indicators asymptomatic transmission. significance increased positivity rate data. selection bias testing.

You're like anti-Fauci. Big yikes. saw higher numbers long term effects. looks like mostly go away within months. people need shut up. media shouldn’t give voice government need hand harsh punishments set examples inbred morons think it’s constitutional right wear mask. opinions Chinese shills matter me. 🤣 Bet fun parties...oh dont parties more...that's right. teacher would nice. one biggest worries could go wrong fast-tracked vaccine? could kill people? /s try tho Deaths long lag initial spike. Mega-corps wanted reopen immediately spread propaganda masks anti-american unchristian. Also virus Liberal hoax. No, ALSO see positivity % tests going up

That means people accurate suspicions able get tested really quickly. Before, probably lot people overreacting diluted percentage.

I'm sorry ruins life UK bad worse US. point where.m tubk every hundred years humanity needs drop like flies. ensure that, stupidity, ignorance justnotgivingafuck rooted deep deep deep DNA Hi, French here. Im far fluent please excuse poor english. Im share.

 First best wishes regarding bad situation USA. Hope people get back common sens mask relevant. Stay safe.

About lockdown France, started March 17 ended May 11. Time, someone said, show printed document ID card case police patrol. mesure generally respected us gov medias everything scare us, like every evening announcing deaths hospital entries. Also people job paid 85% salary (chômage partiel) gouvernement stay home, calm virus spraid. worked far.

Since lockdown like 200 new clusters propagation (also tests so...) gov says control, believe them, im looking actuals stats (""only"" 10+ deaths last days). Wearing Mask transports mandatory. That's it. common sens. go shopping business inside long time, better wearing Mask, you, also others.

STILL, feel concerned youth, recent manifests. many people believes over, unmasked, beachs crowded mayors close temporary. Young people thinks covid kills olders , bother. wish gov remind actually asymptomatic , contagious enough kill grand parents.

Our healthcare social systems saved us, 100k lives, great cost. lost 10 years incomes terrible financial crisis 2008. back scratch less money debts.

Thank read far apologies caused headhach haha.

Amicalement. 6 million? Thats big city US. Apples oranges... simple answer cant stay home enough recommend everything possible lot debated ignored anyways. Back? Well, virus far even normal masks seem help bit, hepa n99 work too, expect 100% protection measurem I'm back going restaurants rate virus. problems God. beginning them. wont even able test enough get accurate numbers. rational trump. 2020 heluva year. Yeah Abbot politely asked everyone wear mask please, we'll ask again. get us 98% compliance need... flu, bro. last comment, boat American, amped order magnitude. hope Trump dangerous klan traitors get WRECKED November. already take us long heal without horrific idea another 4 years nosediving global reputation... There's actually name brain disease. called ""American Exceptionalism"". idea Americans/America inherently superior people/countries. ask politician believe American Exceptionalism, usually say ""of course"". Covid19, response it, tests staying power unity nation. ability come together act evidence defeat enemy much like war ( yes, compare everything war). experience anyone believes America win war another major power they're way optimistic.  kinda 10 days since ive seen gf, since can't go check, welp anyways, chance im infected covid 10 days since ive seen her?

(she doesnt covid also im clear paranoia, someone help me?) really hate kind choice. teachers loved 5+ choice multiple choice questions.

First 3 choices would normal answers, followed combination two choices, above, finally none above.

Some gave ambiguous choices, like ""c. &amp; b"" would work would ""d. above"". Airborne mutating. virus one live like flu. Treatment money be. vaccine constantly changing virus next impossible. nothing, least super volcano, asteroid, new ice age, zombie apocalypse

There's 6 months left dude, jinx us. measure. social media team fun shining light serious issue wearing masks correctly. official measure wearing masks public transport (and associated waiting areas like train stations bus stops) already mandatory fined refuse it.  

But course people still forget properly. anything reminds probably helps little bit. wish used remarkable illustration instead highlights problem much better. Ahaha, ""we're idiots, what's excuse"". true. Even insurance covers it, subscribers still paying inflated prices shitty premiums. like Walking Dead weird society people living dump develop weird sub-language within 3 years. basically point gave show.

NH, KY, RI: reports today 😳 God hate every thing virus 😷 Guess ... takes month die average... wait celebrating bit. Sports done while. Even start, they'll shut quick. Millionaire athletes behave one person it, cannot game, there's many people team. many die heart disease, cancer car accidents? Perspective people, it’s important know agenda Italy? Germany? possible result testing inflating statistics decreasing death rate.

No, ALSO see positivity % tests going up, too. testing more, increasing % tests positive, means testing that's going up, actual cases going up.

Again, knowing median age dropped testing mean death rate cohort cases lower than, say, 85 year olds. still WAY early actually see meaningful amount data current surge. so, friend, STFU, know what's going happen. it! over! American, waiting surgery. Slow growing pseudo tumour. country free wouldn’t know state still infected need operation. Japan shut anything down, attribute primarily masks, get false sense security. stupid [2% highest Neanderthal DNA percentage Congrats keeping routine. started weightlifting class miss going dearly. kept home missed 2 days quarentine. know would lot stronger going class, i'm still super proud progress made year.

we stay safe! fucking shit, wait 6 months “evidence” airborne...

Shit spreading like wildfire cruise ships, now, finally conclude airborne.  Singapore island well, border pretty tightly controlled. like driving Chicago I-90/94.  Shocked let stand like this. Australian states pubs open strict capacity limits sit table service only, basically going friends can’t mingle. mean socks may well stay home, it’s opening pubs people standing mingling going spread virus. United States absolute stupidest developed nations. many need? Next weeks headline 

“Claims Airborne Coronavirus Retracted WHO.” Exactly people said 3 months ago Japan, yet cases explode. agree. sister mom NHS. I'm worried second wave shut everything back down. 

I get British summer (honestly exception 4 days weathers pretty terrible anyway).

Just say, answering question pov I've read, heard, etc. saying agree it. would keep pubs, barbers, etc closed vaccine treatment discovered. government support economy worry money. 

My hope next election conservative/Johnson gets destroyed. shown care NHS, people's lives anything else except himself, friends power. Keyword title: STILL. Imagine praising guy literally highest death toll

Crickets inslee Unfortunately people infect may lucky. European country excuse ""Economy crashing society verge collapse. might die but: go out, work, spend money cause clue fix shit"". We're talking massive spike US new mirrored UK right now

Testing US massively increased, median age people tested 35 instead 65. possible result testing inflating statistics *and* decreasing death Tell age breakdown covid patients themselves,

I said average testing age 35 US. UK might testing many young I'm talking broader population (sure 38 vs 40 similar).

Why talk broader population? That's testing including US, apparently. go deaths see whose getting affected worse since might disparity testing UK seeing spare healthcare beds waste prudent ""hedge"" resource potentially going fuck us badly,

stfu, know happened That's huge chunk cases that's huge chunk cases WAY EARLY call death data.

Not know median age dropped testing. take week get really bad. virus seems wax wane gets severe ventilator. boyfriend says (doc) enough time yet see deaths. Also younger people infected they're spreading everywhere may see severe symptoms (in many) aren’t testing. 

In 3 months Mexico tested many people US 1 day. 

So obviously they’re undercounting...because inly attribute deaths cases confirmed individuals.

Doctors estimate Mexico’s reals deaths near 75k cases around 6M deficient vitamin dark pigmentation skin.

I keep seeing misinformation vectored. Black Africans evolved dark skin prevent creating **too much** vitamin D, toxic. Blacks vitamin deficient. test vitamin deficiency gives false result  months already, could tell death rate lower thought, mean people fine get it. It’s sometime like getting car crash crippled life. Imagine able breath normally, basically disabled, getting tired way fast, imagine able climb stairs 2 floors needing rest minutes this... things never normal ever again. gotta give libs. start hoax, go in.
They even got real scientists around world join it, got whole lot people die make look realistic.
Fucking brilliant.
Luckily, fearless numbnuts White House saw right it. Remindme! 27 Days Well would always tell facts somehow passes like sieve. likes telling friends like news story. Nothing crackpot theory pulled pundit paid millions him. I'm pretty sure list things read - read *Parable* college, died right finishing that's realized friends one professors, lived right road years. blew rest books time all, enjoyed point recommend often - especially people sick sea white male speculative fiction authors - 20 years, details fuzzy stories blurred together... 

I'll add Bloodchild pile! Short stories are....more achievable toddler house.  don’t care live nightclub packed people fucking *concert* last night. country absolutely overrun idiots. no. Remindme! 27 Days get article all. We've living covid months now. common knowledge uptick infections precede uptick deaths several weeks.

Shouldn't article disaster hit certain states? Yes, troops sent home day benefits kicked  Something tells Bojo Co learned nothing already massive death count. Ever smell fart waft airplane? food heating galley? diaper baby getting changed table 20 rows up? 

You’re damn right air swirling quite bit way outflow valves!





Yeah, think possible euro leagues testing extent? athlete wanted play, I'd want either keep test results secret even test. I'm tired ""I take seriously enough know joke. thought going die. Please link GoFundMe help. God bless."" That's crux matter. know virus *can* spread airborne way rather droplets aerosol, relevant question likely happen. second question answered best evidence gathered disease surveillance contact tracing. still seems like aerosol primary vector transmission real world. Nobody knew healthcare complicated! us Americans, *maybe* #2 might work.

But again, that's future me's problem. e-bike. Fyi. 

So 20 mile ride, 20 mile cycle. Apocalyptic movies ? 

Cancer also, crippling bone tumour, acl surgery, one terrible decisions get hospitality industry gave whole list mental health problems addiction issues, leading collapse entire social life. I've living near poverty decade. 

This fucking walk park! really science support it, terms studies, experiments, evidence, etc.

This simply true spoken ignorance superficial reading information 26th. guys invade us liberate us stupid? evident never travel outside county.
If get 💰 suggest visit Costa Rica, example, could said whatever want 3rd world social security systems 11k new cases **that know of**. much worse that. read everything /r/FloridaCoronavirus anecdotes around state terrifying. 

People waiting 12+ hours tested. Testing sites reaching capacity 9 closing day. Sites running testing supplies shutting down. 

With cases exploding across nation running everything. It’s gonna interestingly months. point lot nurses needed home cities, they’re already burned there’s way consider taking another emergency contract. Also hospitals requiring 14 day quarantines contracts. talking about? course [Canada don’t see could contagious wasn’t air borne. I'm hospital employee. He's wrong.

This growth truly unsustainable. We're also worried shortages. We'll need start rationing PPE August. We're already rationing tests due backlog reagent. I've got handful vents left. running low medications

We're already prematurely discharging make room. thought too, researched it, sources saying droplet nuclei actually airborne! offer less protection tought, none. still barrier microdroplets get caught reach you.

So nothing else, still better mask. Well, South Korean government tries best, unfortunately, assholes ones reveal personal details, phone numbers, etc.

Why? knows. doxxing already plans set petition actively police asshole behavior. Folks want deal masks drive Kirtland- iced cream shop 306 require patrons wear face-masks- many girls behind counter masks noses patron (in line not) wearing one, respecting social distancing. That’s mighty high horse sit there, (Texas) flattened curve well cities bright blue like CA. problem States get major cities critical thinking skills go way down. CA advantage wiser government officials though point South fucked. We’ll survive though, always do.  It’ll take us little longer lot blood Governor’s hands. Ok true, effectiveness indoor social distancing going undergo major re-evaluation downgraded.... Better? Charlie procreators! What's lead time pallet studs? Allowing Brazil free travel. clear! THIS. noticed too. there’s one thing know, it’s age appears biggest predictor mortality. difference 18 years, kidding?! conclusion study doesn’t even mention inability control age study (I’m sure many oldest people unable take HCQ b/c kidney function), significantly influence results. possible scientific study? Seems negligent best. fucks sake OFFICES still open INDOOR DINING states. beaches. hiking trails parks even gyms open windows garage doors. Even one scientists front lines science airborne transmission says this.

The hysterical ""throw photo crowded beach sidewalk!"" preventing anyone anything, CLEARLY, start discussing offices country closed cause middle management asshole type boss likes see people working person? shiny buildings poor ventilation windows open sit sharing air people HOURS END.

The fact even Cuomo allowed reopened NYC offices (almost 80% said thanks, thanks, WFH fine) tell everyone something fishy going - like wanting price commercial real estate crater vaccine happens. There's already enough tourists spread everywhere else. need effective mandatory quarantine tourists go home.  Well people got it, places...yet. UK Italy example vast majority population it, seems. Antibody tests even NYC suggest 15% people although accuracy uncertain. need engage that's takes get change mind. worth it. Didn’t parents die COVID Cocaine smuggling difficult closed borders leader Israel? damn Israel, better job committing atrocities electing leader. People Brazil enter Portugal tested negative Covid last 72 hours. lol actually fought highest level competition MMA bit silly say sucks. beat elite fighters prime. he's undefeated mean sucked. Taking adult patients pretty much peds nurse’s worst nightmare. I’ve dreading possibility since started. Hopefully things don’t get point Atlanta we’re anything prevent so... Florida tried declare independence wasn’t internationally recognized, Catalonia 2017 friend got self isolating think billionaire insurance companies! profits!!!!!! agree whole comment, last sentence sums behavior perfectly. like stopped maturing age 12. (No offense average 12 yo there) 6 feet still better 1 feet. spread certain conditions airborne way mean droplets less likely spread virus. That’s mighty high horse sit there, (Texas) flattened curve well cities bright blue like CA. problem States get major cities critical thinking skills go way down. CA advantage wiser government officials though point South fucked. We’ll survive though, always do.  It’ll take us little longer lot blood Governor’s hands. Dumb shits probably relating Covid masks Muslim face coverings. I'm confused too

We know poor Americans kids

In fact, studies worldwide show poorer less educated are, kids usually have.

So....

How hell poor Americans affording births? Morocco shutdown everything except factories . Well 3 months staying home opened 10x number daily infections shutdown. Thats show much harder poor society cant physically stay apart. effective unless covering mouth nose Let's make every american go viral bankrupt insurance companies Question testing. I’m surgery week requiring get corona test done guess GA making sure lungs heathy.... idk. Anyways, wondering effects getting brain tickled? Anyone experience sinus problems? Lets real, soon became two party country doomed. would perfect specimen study lab.... quite. droplets aerosol still droplets, smaller 5µm. stay air longer therefore reach farther. refering latter?

But that's still virus able spread without inside droplet, matter small. need it. Somebody getting paid back end. Trump knows chance winning next election donors getting antsy placate them...by overpaying drug US probably even use of.

If US serious coronavirus, would national plan, enough PPE, enough masks now. 

There even serious guidelines mass events cancelled US concerned bought entire supply treatment? Please. customers mistreating workers

This conversation desperately need society, addition surface-level one article. 

""The customer always right"", defense battle-hardened servers would tell can't get particular condiment hamburger, taken completely proportion decades. Retail/food workers gets spat on, screamed at, assaulted, everyone tolerates it. don’t theories. You’re sheep so-called safety neither responsibility fucking problem said, I’m around people constantly. work constantly takes mask “breaks” breath. past week also complaining needle-sharp pain throat. Besides her, county cases ever before. We’ll see it’s like coming weeks. Social distancing window. idea less time spend close others better. That's still true. ""could"" needs ""would"".  rose 212,326 24 hours, data showed, breaking previous record 190,566 set June 28. still know nurse thinks virus isn’t bad. works hospital, can’t begin understand delusional someone must contradict much seeing firsthand damage it’s caused. LOL fucking come country try pull ignorant bullshit that's going States...I think LOL

locked belong Well live US you’re going get current leadership. See side entirely true. people allowed enter Canada get Alaska right citizens Alaska people working Alaska provide proof last post, discussed possibility plantation-like ""factories"" full women paid sex deliver babies purpose delivering new baby eat every week even days post collapse. COVID-19 still persists times factories exists due social distancing rules would mean many paying people starve. right exactly privatized health care stupid. sell soul devil able live. Utter nonsense. goddamn dogshit. 

Absolutely Robin. Even bat pooper scooper can't clean up. Aye bb... Given millions people recovered I'm suprised heard anything people significantly re-exposed, whether reinfected not. jurisdiction lax ethical standards relatively low-risk survivors would volunteer re-challenge study wonder. evidence existed prior virus mostly focused influenza. flu mask wearing (surgical masks) effective stopping spread. evidence, favour mass use masks. Starts top. entitlement ignorance is. mean MLS literally starts week. It’s gonna shit show, they’re playing. think like ""United States' Florida"". Puerto Rico part Union, Catalonia actually part Spanish state. 

Anyway, probably ""where is"" ""what country belongs to"". expect people know Spain Catalonia. 132,000 reported deaths US last 4 months.

Worldwide reported deaths outside China totalled 175 March 2nd. Well people allowed go Canada get Alaska citizens Alaska people going work need provide proof. people Alaska, cant say ""I'm going holiday California"" get Canada go.  course rise, indoor activity. thing airborne they're saying, busy beaches, parties protests would lead increase cases. didn't, kept dropping. 

Also England pretty bad distancing requirement wear masks. Slightly 20% wearing masks 60% USA. store ordering people wear masks whole time. main reason picked Biden want Trump win November need someone right wing possible could sway moderate voters.

Bernie left wing lot American voters stand much chance moderates voted Trump 2016, way win swing moderates. made fun study

What talking about? published 2003 Absolutely not. Double absolutely reading comments. think south seemingly rise cases north relatively ok. One good things social media shit like gets caught pretty quick. 

Good catch. amazes asked. least they're better ""chin-breathers"". Sigh. also exposure time, likely fine. cases France test extremely sick individuals.  20,000 per million compared 110,000 per million.  USA per capita administering 5.5 times number tests per capita France. France’s per capita death rate coronavirus higher despite nowhere near liberal accounting US, example including deaths without positive test. 

Honestly, Euro love sub based evidence feels. That's state actors tend use bioweapons. Proper terrorist groups want cause much carnage chaos possible; care half soldiers die (how many 9/11 hijackers survived?) Shaudenfreude? don’t cry ? Deaths slowly trending places spiking. thing better treatments fewer people die take longer it. simple fact people get die. /r/cringe  better shape average American half age. Earlier pandemic ill getting tested lag spike cases deaths 2-3 weeks. testing illness caught sooner deaths probably lag even more. Iran new spike virus took month deaths start going up. don’t expect death numbers bad last time young demographic getting infected better treatment though Yeah Florida screwed Probably 3 percent, situation similar Bergamo. countries losing people per million, beginning take strict measures, recent infection death rates drastically reduced thanks measures taken, know happening US right Close bar down, people go one.  Lose one got another one. Oh! first one opened back let’s go back. like fleas. Spreading disease everywhere go. would better even bar flys stayed contained, contaminating mostly other. would best close together but. guess money. So. Everyone suffer die. rough go start severe lack testing tracing less adequate seems like turned tide hopefully keep way.

I hope best American people going forward breaks heart see high daily caseloads. Stay safe healthy! Depends infected, it’s older people you’re trouble, it’s younger people you’re probably ok.

But yes hospital capacity large concern primary reason introducing mandatory measures slow spread (lockdown, distancing, closures etc) Thankfully, much people abusive staff. understood, many customers little parking lot handle got shut week rethink things. definitely weird see security guards standing outside ice cream shop lmao may political US joke somewhere. Oh totally think awesome system March/April, I'm upset hospitals still need June/July. big difference quality care provided ICU nurse 2 assistants covering 3 patients 3 ICU nurses patient. hospital ICU nursing normally one one, assign two patients per nurse relatively stable, Covid ICU patients stable. Researchers Oxford said death rates hospitalised Covid patients dropped 1/4 April, forced things back then, lose much progress lock-downs brought us. cruise ship people proved effectively. also 'windmills cause cancer' idiots. heard year Trump embraced idea. traveling CT/RI It’s NY NJ plates today. It’s nothing surprised, it’s sheer ignorance. see experience first hand, it’s late! Ah yes third world. know perfectly well everybody uses subdivision. 

Third world pretty much synonym developing countries nowadays. Mmr isn’t given year. like NYC, peak go away.

NYC near total lockdown slowed down. going ""go away"" completely lock down. Exponential growth=disaster. social cost idiocy tragic. now, I'm ashamed 16-year-old. atrocious. though? Honest question, seeing people mobile good gauge proxy you? app doesn’t give locations they’re going to, they’re where, packed areas they’re going anything like that. simply gives data people moving spot spot often move given day. 

There’s huge difference say going office every day. work office that’s spaced 2-3 people max, one that’s packed dozens given day? dozens far higher risk single digits reopening, yet users would register mobile activity getting them. they’re leisure time...are driving bike secluded, isolated area cardio work heading packed gym? Even worse, skipping heading packed bar happy hour 0 social distancing sight? things different level risks, yet register movement app...it’s indicator they’re going where, *are* indeed moving. 

Americans ignored throw safety protocols, specifically south since states started reopen. They’ve gone like pandemic over, completely disregarded threat threw things like distancing, safety protocols, masks etc right window. see UK opened past weekend? *Thats* proxy looking for...this spell good things keep up. Bars packed everywhere, social distancing sight, PPE way overcrowded areas...it’s like watching Texas, Arizona Florida month ago again. One night one it, keep crap though? They’ll find right southern states absolutely time. may wrong, feel Canada way, way responsible reopenings we’re simply seeing type behavior Canadien folks. keeps bet fine, long keep thing check let guard down. virus proven give inch take mile policies driven sense logic, financially lucrative are. Can't make money parks open. Friend carry knife. Got mom pepper gel well. never know frustrated individual want carry racial hate way look. Sure. expecting anti-science stuff, say psychiatry psychology. Maybe somewhere; interest relatively mild. Nah. Dont be. went back school double time, job enjoy, making damn good money dont get abused anymore. Totally worth it. Even though EMS job fired found going school something that's zero benefit them.......yay employment!!! India undergone extreme bouts nationalism decades left weaker confront threats like virus. Mainly pouring money select areas country allowing vast majority fend themselves. need new Manhattan Project tackle fusion energy. best bet. Sounds like good way get shot. high school classmate NICU nurse Vero Beach, telling folks pandemic real threat numbers inflated ""I seen covid patients unit must happening"". classmates talk heading beach asking advice, uses status nurse dole out... uhh... ""guidance"". quite heavyset not-exactly-young people group. unkindness meant, obesity age contributing factors complications COVID. can't sit lawn chair home grumble one make wear mask. Jeez. Nasal swab. get it, realize leaving dead contaminated bodies laying around everywhere public spread make worse? get seems cold, worst, immediately cremate bodies even need done mass pits? get bad PR bad look, worse? Exactly! Got keep well hydrated one way other. became famous SARS publicly rebuked official line SARS caused chlamydiae. turned right cause new coronavirus.

This time around first person go initial judgement ""limited H2H transmission"". went trip Wuhan several experts seeing confirmed cases medical staff went national TV said shit serious must significant H2H transmission happening. Ok well didn’t read article. that’s case totally agree I'd prefer classify discriminatory behaviour based fear rather hatred / feeling superiority another race, racism defined core.

But lets get lost details, what's happening bad. OP died covid could finish typing title post know we’re getting lot Seattle. Thanks that. feel like even tho already 2 3 still given protection Rubella. I've never really given much thought now. GP (in UK) seeing people person emergencies minute doubt I'll able get anytime soon, definitely look it. Walk clinic Katy. Urgent Kids Care something similar. first come/first served 3:00. kids only. Think near 99 Westheimer. not. wish “establishment” would fear young people respect vote listen needs. Everyone traveled Florida fourth high risk bring shit home them. BJP official one area beat police asked son mask was. avoiding medical care due fact 10 years ago decided doctor. regretted even once, 74 years old. boyfriend dumbass. Let Rona take him. think anger misplaced.  Nearly protestors saw wearing masks also distancing themselves. That's true partiers beach, bars, going parties. referring huge beard one short medium length. guessing didn’t matter wondering. Well end result lot individual freedom. parts Europe life slowly returning normal. Wearing masks social distancing small price pay. covered childhood vax? need booster shot? dude sooooooo yesterdays headlines.  :/ ""Wave"" one get most. places still climbing first ""wave"". Passed France, catching Italy. Gen Z here, correct.

We generation lost hopes broken dreams. Yeah duh; they're ones going protests restaurants bars shit. #YOLO American Airlines entered chat Senator went CNN yesterday complain previous President's response Ebola, pointing current President stepping forward knew shit like going start happening soon Targets getting burned down. Filial piety would've good start. fact every accusation Trump makes ends admission tells “China Virus” branding attempt came heels briefed US’s fault. 🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦 think fair statement. way late Japan locked (did even lockdown?) yet they're really well. Family visited weekend NC refused go BBQ, everyone thinks I’m family crazy now, calling leftist shit bc refused go...go back home. daily chats everyone trying prove something longer assumed since arent seat office. LOL. hear nightmare conference calls. BJP gonna pretend Fake News. suggest make happen ? mortality rate? enough bunker isn’t. Wear mask live life. Believe know I’m minority subreddit, said, I’m majority actual people. realize physicians billing, right? Best news I’ve year. Thank congrats! get persecuted FBI though, guess lawyers good. understand actually touched things people focusing on, hospitalizations, ICUs yes, deaths.

Here’s problem cases.

When peak deaths per day average (2255) many cases two weeks prior account many deaths? charts show something range 20k. actual number? one clue unless reverse equation try approximate number cases based mortality rate (or hospitalization rate tho common person stats readily available national level.)

So 2-3 weeks ago official daily case trend somewhere 22-25k range, slightly accounted peak deaths, today 516 deaths per day lowest figure since March 30th.

So yes Cases would mean something I’d idea percentage total infections capturing, don’t. 

I obviously expect deaths rise... case figures ridiculous fraction actual infected numbers can’t accurately predict outcomes using incomplete numbers especially don’t even know incomplete are.

And point. guy says back “peak levels” assume expects daily deaths return 2255 7 day average next week two. 

So guess find he’s right not. I’m saying won’t be. evolving infectious, severe. civil... Well, duh. Mistakes made, Germany learned mistakes.  Can't say can't happen actively happening - things really normal creep norm - countries particularly US right now.  guess never even thought that. happy (hopefully) home safe. But, that’s really sad think it. Stop shaking hands already idiots! Teenager (18) much introvert would never ""be raising ruckus"" corona still affected too. last 6 months, become much cynical lost much optimism. still live ""It could worse"" attitude ""worse"" changed drastically. school weather-related stuff epidemic similar mortality black plague (1346–1353). And, think it, one race didn’t want win. - racist pieces shit acting like bunch racist pieces shit. death family close friend happen One ready elections... said could find exceptions there. massive compilations anti-mask Karen videos point. none seemed specifically related masks comment ""This kind anti-mask shit happening anywhere United States"". Ooh surprised. teachers strike, parents take hit pressure districts states. 

Obviously nothing overpowered police union teacher unions pushovers. thing that's wild dont see people getting 1% mortality rate line- resolved cases worldwide, something like 8% deaths. US higher percentage deaths rest world, maybe I'm one confused, idk people getting 1% (which still *huge*, btw). 

Like, would include active cases metrics, they're even resolved? doesnt make sense. 

We saw 40k new cases yesterday, like 300 deaths, disease deaths usually lag 3 - 5 weeks infection. death numbers going start skyrocket end July, late since states already ICU capacity.. Yea I’m ya. daughter supposed go SK year schools reopen I’m really considering sending her. I’m extremely lucky though husband work home, actually ability homeschool needed. Eating Thai food could prevent severe Covid. evidence is, Thailand low Covid. Pure science. live newborns given MMR? Important question: Trumps vaccine, one produced country's efforts?? size scope Disney magnitudes larger parks combined. 23 students 2 teachers bereaved die. means lost loved one. less tragic clarify. Washington, Jefferson, et al shown little less hypocrisy freed slaves lived, instead waiting longer mattered them. Yes, obviously, protestor knowingly goes protest covid? penalty. That’s hurting lot people supporting cause, person would purpose others garbage. have. every opportunity so. I've two friends businesses, several relatives, got loan. Anywhere 3 employees 40, got loans. Every country 'masks' vs. US. getting lucky guess? much getting paid CCP? know china owns reddit, full propaganda teams, ridiculous. see did. internet go away, nice try gaslighting people, China lied. lied contagious, waited months telling world. made sure spread, economy tanked. borderline act war. shows antiquated China is, selfish health. Really disgusting defending CCP, whose worse nazi germany. Theres 2 million concentration camps, China enemy. abuse human rights even USA, ""impressive"". Fuck bullshit. remember governor moron like KEPT SAYING HAPPEN HASNT! HAHAHA MORONS, LETS PARTY! 

seems worked well long move beach condo, groceries/food delivered relatively safe, correct? precautions take? Maybe we'll get task force hindered, impeded, obstructed, etc. leader meant serve..... I’ve seen ones look like surgical masks actually 3 layers knows material. I'm talking people going bars, parties, beaches people towel towel regular basis. I'm sure part comment insinuated think people allowed leave house, absolutely think slowed roll opening everything quickly. can't count many people come contact daily basis care get sick see understand many people affected get sick. 

And know what? think fact people hungry, abused, without resources first world country massive part problem begin with. pointed out, mental health also issue country definitely going get better numbers rising 50k+ day.  I’m k-12 teacher Brevard. principal seems think schools open close...personally, don’t know anymore. Desantis many state seem willing sacrifice anyone daycare kids. daycare, mean school. 

I suppose doesn’t help family ‘this hoax’ ‘I’ll never get vaccine!’ camp. 

I’m tired incompetent leadership clear message. I've luckily laid putting aside money cares act. call back in.. idiots beach memorial day weekend.

""nah believe Corona virus""

You die icu choking phlegm, good. feel teachers do, seems bit ridiculous argument countries like Canada teachers fought deem ""essential service"". Teachers canada compensated fairly, whenever contract negotiations come always play essential card. hundreds teachers calling go back school (they still getting paid) due danger, essential workers grocery store workers, firefighters, nurses, corrections work. can't ways... generalize. kids great home. miss teachers understandable. happy kids There’s way could retire. There’s nothing else make much money health insurance pay mortgage.... neighbor told teach 120 students five days per week school year. travel 6 different classrooms throughout day. also monitor students eat classroom. time permitted take masks converse eat. 

Students choice wear masks shields.

Her district discuss protocols place students staff become infected, student becomes symptomatic, sent home. Staff told school cannot held liable unless actions egregious. 

I can't see opening fully spiking pandemic anything foolish surely usher second wave enter Fall. COVID-19 going go one worst disasters country ever experienced, single worst. People kill people communities giving COVID also going go wrong side history.

Of course desperately hope i’m wrong deaths simehow coming. Please let wrong, PLEASE. FHM always open deaths latest 7-10 days reliable deaths reported. 


I repeat: source Sweden's ""very serious time lag"" compared countries? view hospital utilization? many times people post 10k cases per day 4500? Oh, looks like right. Ignoring problem obviously working. rate going 20k cases per day week so. point assume real information relationship wife based three sentences. Yep, true Washington State sending patients Yakima, Benton, &amp; Franklin Counties hospitals around state relive acute shortage beds. 

The problem come second major outbreak starts. 2020: Red Pill Strikes Back Yeah fucking way country run into/by chaos ill prepared leadership. sub full panic mode. hate see informative rational sub changed panic echo chamber  always reported funny numbers went 20 mile bike ride electric bike! LMAO Disneyworld opens July 11th. contained virus numbers still rising. Um... Alright? Exactly. Give amount PPE think need. I've already heard stories certain companies letting employees work home can't hire nannies take care kids(or something like that)

Glad kids right now, already desire kids mental issues, damn sure know put bullshit. Nice deflection bucko! Always love someone brings random point end argument slam dunk. Everyone believes corona virus, everyone mom dad paying rent, eat home. can't shut things forever, point let hospitals catch up. Mind whole thing China's fault. China caught multiple times stealing info, lying virus, specific lab outbreaks before. lab tech bats piss head, routinely follow safety procedures. China wants anyone like them, need clean. Stop polluting, stop killing Muslims harvesting organs/hair, maybe I'll listen propaganda comrade. disgusting thing say. 

A human life human life. Didn’t know three months ago? Maths?  China doesn’t count asymptomatic infections cases. didn’t that, we’d half many cases! another corrupt government fuck you, thanks I’ll put pile rest. thank sir please keep stating obvious JFC going file this: Flu season also like 5-6 months too, effective vaccines treatments. 

With vaccines treatment flu I’d also imagine we’d see deaths similar Covid. second, third. forget new H1N1 strain? also understand hard would keep society stable economy growing COVID large.

And, critically, acted much earlier US due seemingly grasping exponential risk bit better.

I mean there's many ways split really hard come argument country little response have. Going hard, early, initial reaction really. should. valid findings, nr. 1 rare nr. 2 affects way children engage virus would probably already seen effect statistics. No, still scary illness, treatment works 85-90% cases date limited treatment window, it’s big threat today ways limit spread, right mainly spread among wild animals across world.  way title written kinda makes sound like experts breeding think base care this? believe something, BELIEVE think 50 outdoor weddings now, although absolutely sure Best step bro ever

Because fucks us? RNA vaccines novel. None yet approved human use.

If want line rushed RNA vaccine trust say safe, great. work. 90% comments political so... feel attacked bad Congress get act together; we've 102 years prepare. Oh there’s tons benefit—it’s it’s privatized exclusive benefit corporations use maximize profitability. Companies like Google fully aware goldmine they’re sitting on. forecast virus going weeks now, trivial would make eerily accurate economic forecasts inform invest? future think we’re going figure awful lot billionaires consolidating ever larger slice economic pie tools like these. It’s shame won’t use public health worst pandemic 100 years people want maintain delusion “privacy.” American thing? thought alone struggle. heh, begins, scientific community keep silent longer.

The ""but also originate anywhere else"" nice touch, ease people next development. work submarine much everyone wanna bet dolt lives hillbilly town hes never stepped take slaughter Sweden 1993 2000 excess death hardest months even higher pandemic? take Swedens response time? rest Europe, even world? 

I mean get people like claim saving lives number one priority, Sweden managed keep deaths bellow amount deaths occured 2 influenza periods last 20-30 years (which majority even k ow about) without pulling kids schools etc... win book. Ok. quick discussion mod colleagues. Approved. maybe half-baked dangerous plans go effect August see fall out.

This going happen. going barest minimum security theatre entire school system crash weeks school year. something leadership preparing last months, instead come last minute “half-baked dangerous plans” going hope virus fooled away weak attempts.

My school scheduled professional development late July *nothing* sort safety measures. feel like nobody taking seriously all. Heyo I’m supposed fly Deerfield Beach Florida stay fam’s condo week... see could lmk risk assessment? you’re area may know thought I’d try c: Bailed bond market real quick Glad see us US trailing Iran common sense Luckily I'm nice part SJ everyone taking pretty serious still wearing masks completely behind that, never occurred uselessly bloated police forces are, justification existence ALSO relies everyday calls business armed first place. GOP firmly unemployment extension real killer viruses fought science that’s super boring, it’s also fucking nerds. 

After 9/11 got fight real war people speak different language using missiles bullets bombs that’s fucking BADASS. 

The virus isn’t “other” hate bomb. That’s thing gets us motivated people. would signal virus serious unified national response. mandating masks giving kind federal guidance virus quietly ignored rich finish pillaging nation. know people recovered, even hospital pretty long stints, they're okay now. ""Back normal"" basically. natural selection infection rates much higher 25% still contribute collective immunity. .................Yeah, said, opposite.

Back topic rona: threat real, stay home, avoid people. Kthx. he's anti-mask, per se... come strongly pro-mask. April said encouraged others wear masks, said """"I think I'm going it,"" said back then. ""Wearing face mask greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens - see it.""

Then four days ago say something positive masks, ""If tight situation people would, absolutely.""

So strongly endorsed masks, strongly come either. think wanted Americans wear mask though, would need come wearing mask make speech importance masks American people. likely happening pretty low. Damn they’re going cut class sizes 50%? everyone halfway degree, they’re going fighting half lab spots required courses need finish degree programs. Could really set people back. sounds almost bad America. Ontario hospital, routinely full 1 ICU bed reserve codes. Kind funny/sad see Americans worried available beds, normal zero decant needed.  Asking sincerely: What's wrong RNA vaccines what's Moderna? China stated, vaccines public good. purchased government cost, provided public free. actually simple. China this, along rest world. Everyone actually paid slightest bit attention happened countries restaurants US issues saw coming. 🤦 Government knew would happen. Maybe citizens paying attention conspiracy theory beliefs got way lack intelligence, pretty obvious would happen. know, solve equation let know. yea people really started social distancing. protesting pandemic kind defeats purpose mitigating spread. “No contact tracing” well? pathologically stupid?  never run long rich arrange benefit situation. creation disaster, opportunism. Never waste crisis that. main reason dread going back school. kids little cant always help it, co workers know lax wearing mask social distancing. administrator enforce either. interesting come October. like turtles Infections 90% peak... Friend mine volunteered ICU march-april, one bed short able save people anymore. first wave. Criminal unemployment stuff, whole state government (like AZ) deserves go Went store morning. Customers masked save two cops presumably enforce mask usage. proceeded come inside chit chat everyone. unbelievable. Well doctor *doubly* wish dont kill anybody! would never happen America . worthless media would never let fear run dry. fighting constant propaganda wave 99 percent patients issues.

Best estimate 1 200 die, least 1 50 go hospital. anyone 40 hitting hospital high likelihood long term health issues. happy medium China, one welding incident western media blows proportion Could lies mask efficacy... could ""it'll gone line miracle Easter,"" could insistence ""it's airborne"" science shows is... could state governments demanding scientists fabricate data firing refuse... could way governments hiding half covid deaths reporting incorrectly... yeah... reason blindly trust governments? totally understand better situation would national healthcare. Ideally, everyone would equal easy access quality care. However, that's real America, despite absurd is. 

There free testing sites near me, wait 4-5 hours tested 10-14 days results. dad went testing site coworker test positive. went local clinic. waited 4 hours paid $79. discount health insurance. can't wait see bill insurance company top that! results 4 days. Also stupid trusting people would right thing? There's older studies bjt they're validating further. Hong Kong, Madagascar others interesting read. That’ll slow it! Correct. prob thinks sign weakness countries vaccine required, people safe. dysfunctional countries like US, people keep dying, people still afraid go out, economy sink, U.S. becomes like Venezuela. 😂 Holy fuck Wow, reaching.

Okay explain: Washington State. Nah bro. work like that. Young people affected. Stash elderly weak inside. Let us young people party. anything outside New York, DC, maybe Maryland they're places seem give shit. Rip restaurants last list,

Close. Schools last. Pubs restaurants before. getting RNA vaccine companies like Moderna.

why? trump hand it? 

for me, safe effective, i'm getting it. matter from. // afford want them, wouldn’t you?
// opportunity raise person ideals

If see two statements could questioned think one lacking perspective. motives behind often borne compassion suffering another moral question offsetting potential joy potential pain. wonder that's plan? Open schools citizens get mad, know they'll close within week two anyway. let's face it, soon one student, teacher, staff member tests positive COVID, whole school going go quarantine. mean time many people get sick that? seem worth it. one touch takes ever seen. opinion, far tell, trust authorities perfect preventative measures worth following unless cutting edge medical technologies. 

Masks worked 1917. Masks work now. Please stop trying insert skepticism without evidence. posting random musings, seem serving purpose negative. profit healthcare system We’ve dealing 6 months doctors finding new better ways treat this. 

As a) stop killing patients premature intubation b) dont send infected seniors long term care facilities cause huge outbreaks there

Now doctors figured out, surprisingly death rates dropping. Everyone husband's company dying go back. thought they'd effective, miss real-time collaboration. expected it, company asked would want stay home permanently, wanted single moms childcare issues. anti vaxx crystal healing friend posted meme mom group said nothing worry Penn State University's faculty already written open letter protesting school's return in-person classes fall. Good luck! far know cursory read [CARES helps costs related testing, treatment supposed left insurance. may mean still paying deductible costs covered for. Even dead spared indignity.

It's truly amazing still either. donate fuckin money poor want helpful. start writing fucking checks directly people get fuck way. 

The entire world already havs 160 vaccines development. mangrove crab much like Australia’s drop bear: ambush predator. Mangroves create beautiful, almost cave-live tunnels them; it’s alluring certain types animals (in relatively recent years) people kayaks. crabs climb mangroves much like spiders might, patiently wait prey swim, walk (if water shallow, frequently is), kayak underneath. drop down, frenzy claws pointed legs rend prey.

Alligators sharks get press viscerally terrifying. Mangrove crabs, hand, don’t seem big deal see individually; secret attack swarms.

We probably lose three five people statewide annually mangrove crab attacks. It’s rarely news however. Yeah, lot people desperate find origination point virus assign blame virus refuse take seriously someone themselves.

The origin virus origin humanity, nature. Nature always trying kill humanity that's ever going change. Finding origin first all, unlikely ever happen certainty second, useful science's attempts prepare next one emerges. happen know chance difference resilient virus contained water droplet vs simple airborne viral particles? 

My understanding virus (mostly) transmitted airborne water droplets - much smaller degree simple airborne transmission. hospital beds? Guess I'm going beach then! Like I’m even joking 🤣 
I whole bottle along prescription Pepcid dog.

Who knows else studies going say “cured” covid? shoes anecdotal non hard scientific evidence broad studies controlled? They're trying best abort Cuz “muh freedom” least people trying keep nice holiday.

Allow NIL scholarship limits effectively meaningless. kill golden goose. link shows sero-prevalence studies ~10x number cases. Nothing IFR. google ""0.26 covid IFR"" hopefully read. Thanks trying though.

Again hope I'm wrong. I'm older you. seem stubborn intent killing people ignorance. ostrich effect, hard get over. 

All best.  find stats? I'm Hillsborough side looking something similar. claims lot things, know. acted much earlier US due seemingly grasping exponential risk bit better.

lol President like ""just 11 cases"" okay yeah started one case... reassuring! Going hard, early, initial reaction really.

Our president would've interpreted attacking economy anything virus. Oh I’m 100% you. I’ve chat comments users felt like astroturfing big time. Especially aggressive condescending anyone dared go narrative, poof like miracle disappeared Yeah, American, expect leader intelligence agencies know China lies time. Oh wait, brief leader it.

So American, first thought hold accountable ignoring it. It’s fucking brainer tbh. Oh that's way way long wait test results. Stupid Limeys ADA required Yeah, number deaths always increasing. daily deaths increasing *not* say decreasing. watching stream every day, always objective regarding numbers, reminding everyone lag deaths. Dallas public outdoor parks closed take daughter local gymnastics gym problem mask. Figure one me. Tell people Vietnam. country land border China, ninety million people, fairly basic healthcare system COVID deaths. 

They completely stopped intercity travel weeks, enforced much stricter 'shelter-in-place' rules U.S. tested like crazy. man barricades roads highways, tore roads. them, strict shutdown long took crush outbreak indeed 'sustainable'.

The pandemic made clear bad Americans civilization. country's wealth healthcare infrastructure certainly account 4% world's population 25% world's COVID cases. disparity is, great degree, result pathologically egotistical selfish society.

Trust say, want person hospital developing pulmonary oedema interstitial fibrosis. kill you, living interstitial lung disease rest shortened life going fun. Think, able walk flight stairs without getting completely breath.

The US heading real calamity, infection rate fall soon. hospital's run beds infections continue rise... well, nightmare scenario healthcare practitioner.

But yeah... keep ignoring we’re middle pandemic. hope family members fare well. educated

Found error media asking hospitals increase ICU bed capacity past months? Didn’t China build huge hospital little 10 days meet demand surge ICU capacity? knew day would come

We did, Governor DeSantis didn't! Anything appease fool White House.

However, light devastating effect lockdown measures, world governments general going loose approving vaccines.  We’re already seeing quickly pushed clinical trials. betting one India? new cases involve vulnerable people. vast, vast majority mild. apocalyptic. Villages going turn Hamlets. Oh I'm aware, live rural area, needs solved ASAP. That’s says that’s hospitals run.

Also, every positive case reported somewhere 10 80 people get tested. conservative, say number 10, means day 10k reported actually 100k. Throw exponential growth take account people thst already it, looking 8 weeks blow lock intervention. informed someone could sell dogs tramadol street. LOL. We're sending best people.

Wrong! 99% Trump spews pie hole baseless lies. see downvoted want clarify: social distancing. restaurants presence impact. people changing sheets hotel stay at. everyone come contact with, possibly bringing home families. health safety community.

It's also you, family, community. anyone possibly bring thing back to.

 I've seen others ask question asked mean condescend. I'm typing feel anyone still asking question quite understand impact decisions make right now. get sick, anyone around spread get sick die. may take two weeks get back vacation see personal impact, may never see many asymptomatic. spread still others.

Like said, mean condescend. mean say makes angry anxious see many tourists understanding (or caring) thoughtless actions impact community. 38 ICU beds left open Friday. look like two weeks? Florida. Testing rates actually gone backwards. bad feeling we're watching people trying get papers published journals wanting papers increase impact factor journal.

What goddamn fucking moron. Guy claiming hospital executive also claims they’re treating virus antibiotics. Seems untrustworthy me, knows. Two weeks. Always two weeks reason. people fight culture war, masks one front. Look turns ""all lives matter"" chants. kind funny chant anti-mask prioritizing wishes potentially sickening someone else. Yup. Basically normal work nothing haven’t seen years I’ve here. Hospital workers can't socially distance. can. matter, senate still acquit. 

Worked trump, till work desantis. 


Hey, maybe they'll vote allow evidence witnesses too!? Seattle young people died BLM riots Covid last month. Doesn’t seem like large group least.... Huh? Seven day moving average 24 NY 45 Florida. Yes people good home life, savings bank, maybe unemployment making similar before, people probably better. Also people still working get work home enjoy working home. know people true. people hard time getting unemployment isolation painful especially live alone. disheartening, lent evidence fact even highest authorities N.A. staying informed keeping valuable published evidence collected medical scientific community pertaining invaluable first hand information transmission virus.

And I'm finding pandemic showing entire world us grown little bit still, least mentally, stupid children.  straight assholes, pandemic helping assholes .... um, world. workplace admits problem, change operate. requires paperwork. ruins senior managers day. /s think country currently this, since cannot force someone take test arrive. mean, China enforce someone flying Toronto take test get flight Wuhan? People voted leaders though, time stop letting hook name politeness. Barely any. Yup, they’re term airborne super loose boots taste? worry. happened Wuhan elevator. People south fucking idiots, that's why.

It appreciated gatewaypundit oan Fox news What? hospital saying airborne unless procedure going would (intubation, trach, etc), we've treating patients they're droplet isolation, airborne realize pretty easy protect airborne particle: ventilate. Open windows. Take children classroom every hour.

I know sounds scary, there's also lot prevent transmission. Mostly things already mentioned everywhere. also (and less important): let stay/go home moment show symtoms. next months, children (or adults) around runny noses, cough allergy problem. signs corona infection, mostly possible infections spread way. hospitals overflow like April see your2500 deaths per day. teacher parent believe need get kids back much possible. 6yo taking hard. She’s exhibiting behaviors she’s never exhibited before. It’s emotionally devastating her. needs friends teachers much needs avoid Covid. I'm never using elevator apartment again. Stairs on. yes, rich people dont want lose penny avoid NY, got test results back 36 hours (was Negative). know fast NJ definitely doable Well. then. WEAR FUCKING MASK 3 half New Orleans. world got PPE places sourced materials places means we're actively asking demand globally.


Some countries started make own. US says none supplies made domestically.

And reopened, hospitals also competing businesses masks. really hope virus else time quarantine comes PTO I'll pay visit.

That’s uhhh, illegal according FMLA.

Pubs still closed Scotland anyone reading title I'll bite - why? north south typically use forced air systems nonresidential buildings run full time building occupied. south different north? Environment wise, industry standard deliver air around 55 degrees locations. I'm genuinely asking propose lockdown world virus that's airborne relatively low mortality rate. Financially majority countries brink collapsing economy know everyone says life important money, money life intertwined point humanity. Countries like Dubai population 9 million people currently 1million unemployed. Nobody wants go work risk getting ill, need to. government wants millions die, can't afford finance support package keep us fed housed year without completely destroying economy. Even track tracing seems difficult airborne virus realistically that's we're going live on. Even so, rich person afford without income awhile.  poor people can't long morgue trucks idling outside hospitals like NYC do. willing go back work virus control testing tracing working limit spread.

That's Florida.

I'm willing martyr protect others natural consequences collective bad decision-making. lets check score:

15 Red states getting murdered numbers
1 Blue state.  

yea keep tossing stones glass house. careful okay. Also keep update us best reactions lol. problem allow economy collapse, end 2nd Great Depression 25% unemployment stretches years tens millions people standing lines soup kitchens across country every day, mass starvation poor parts world.

The idea let economy collapse government somehow support everyone child's fantasy, believable never actually seen truly bad economic times look like.

So we're left two bad choices, damage virus damage closing economy does. Great, argument cloth better nothing. easiest way I’ve found lose weight intermittent fasting.

r/intermittentfasting 

Good luck, I’m sorry you’re position :( Came say this. sad. Same. thought common knowledge. take can't provide rebuttal? states honest Pretty sure. Comments like getting removed mods misinformation February. Nice. Exactly referencing. God dare selfish want breath. Indeed did. telling everyone like tuberculosis pneumonia instead flu pandemic. gonna answer question gonna stiff without sense humor? Lol. thought common knowledge whole time.. LOL. wear mask people. wear fucking mask Well, yet agree, Canada. allies, friends. Nobody enjoys seeing this. Canada US handled completely differently. Canada totally non-political. leaders led, politics simply went hold. leaders related health scientific advice medical health experts, (for part) told do, _as country_ . perfect, worked pretty well. wish US could good leadership here. would saved lot lives. seems like US, plan was............don't plan. 
We also realize yet, time relax claim victory. Problem lot companies don’t money. Even franchises chains I’m telling 100% sales wise year ago. Even dine in, available, sales weren’t 100%. places already security, like one McDonald’s restaurants area. People throw things security, pull phones record antagonizing security, sometimes show groups phones out, screaming throwing things recording phone. worst ones I’m told call police, still. abuse service industry workers dealing right ridiculous. still pretty sharp left vs. right, vitriolic.

It's public health always something we've trusted government with. part, left right pulling direction this, conflicting information.

But half politicians downplaying calling hoax, many people would believe them. fact, enough runoff American news people concerned. hospitals full, see e deadly ruling class elected leaders prefer. understand getting downvoted, observed thing. first thing noticed many weight issues. definitely played roll here. ""they're putting database stealing ur soul"" ""I'll die home Thai hoax"" 

This makes sense either. ""the government"" wants compile database people's information, bring existing registration (birth certificates, travel history, medical records, driver's licenses, passport registrations, etc), need fucking drink already.

Me too. Here's actually living this. post doesn’t even make sense. heck making excuse? seen rates infection America? I’m saying compliance poor argument I’m making excuse countries it? Parents would whatever they’re childcare since March, summers kids home. state school lunch program delivers free lunches daily school kids, going since lockdown started.

There’s easy answer fix all. People think opening schools fix economy that, magically, cases won’t spike. really need save imbeciles though?

Yes?

Damn. stated thread, black white situation. still follow get sick due things lack well-conditioned spaces. [Lex learn's Flash's secret I’ve trying proper review evidence basically none unequivocally show advantage PAPR vs N95 v surgical mask. definitely cases whole teams surgical masks *not* getting infected SARS 1 something would certainly wearing 3M full face respirator intubate Covid patient myself. areas US bars open since early May (Wisconsin) fine. different population density levels though. Moral story decide go out, don’t visit elderly relatives wear mask get charge more. Prohibition best thing happen substance controlled organized crime.  Yea, important keep mind (as say) online education younger kids good. may go route, can't forget educational cost decision making process. However, even that, still think likely unwise bring kids back next month. possible Europe rates increase America healthcare everyone seems unrealistic utopia. Yep airborne peoples minds means can't stop it. Well photo says it? masks, distancing... fact expected less government. seems joke them, want money, cares die not? see Facebook, it’s commonly willful ignorance sheer stupidity. thing keep hearing people say “You can’t live life fear!” think lot people don’t want afraid burying heads sand. Obviously, makes lot easier manipulate you’ll cling whatever hear supports want believe.

I say it’s like people wearing masks aren’t exposed true information. They’re choosing ignore don’t want true. Yeah Floridians give fuck. Goodbye 0.2% Florida.

Assuming 0.2% Florida dies covid 42800 deaths.  distinction airborne non airborne seems low water content floating particle allows virus survive longer. scientists writing presenting evidence case.

Do evidence Coronavirus cannot survive dry particulate? 

Although can’t read letter yet read articles SARS Coronavirus main route transmission SARS CoV infection presumed respiratory droplets. However virus also detectable body fluids excreta. stability virus different temperatures relative humidity smooth surfaces studied. dried virus smooth surfaces retained viability 5 days temperatures 22–25°C relative humidity 40–50%, is, typical air-conditioned environments. 


So evidence refute scientists? thinking many list obese. Hasn’t changed pre-coronavirus. going long time. know ER wait times long? Patients ER waiting beds open medsurg ICU. Beds always full pre post coronavirus. better mask all...at least covering mouth muffles idiocy bit. screwed, NYC bit, again. Ha kids going back school September US except handle situation whatsoever. MAGA masks, American flag masks, Lives Matter masks Etsy.

I’m one libs. Would help acted like upset triggered stuff saw one masks? think would make willing wear them? lots evidence disagree in-person healthier kids. 

I'm glad willing take risk. 

I sure hell not. lived Florida way would set foot school building thing well control. Well friend, live America they.


So really going herd immunity. Yes, think that's plan live RGV hospitals diverting patients San Antonio already. would be... 2 people... I’m guessing virus mutated then? Yeah, new concept. demonstrations months ago ""breath"" linger air carried air currents distance depending conditions (indoors, outdoors, amount air current).


For insist droplets spread virus irresponsible best. Think people done lockdown part. Especially we're seeing whack-a-mole strict lockdown countries like Spain, NZ folks grumbling whether took right option they're effectively sealed rest world vaccine arrives... making things illegal stops people things! want test make sure staff protected Worried matter time kids infected today give parents tomorrow. really fucking stupid? chatter US people get asymptomatic. concept exist following up? comes fresh outbreak saw 100 people test positive Covid-19, reports Spanish newspaper ABC. Heard it. Keeping eye out. people talking Covid beating immune system pretty bad last thing need another pandemic. need torch 5G towers continue wearing masks make sure even control! shitty week indeed Oh wow, that's early. school year also end early then? longer holiday breaks? Agreed. work middle school level, take everything stayed above, remove potential personal hygiene, add boatloads personal contact space violation. Middle schoolers zero sense personal space other. It’s bad news. appreciate bringing up. gotten point really hard read articles, important, induces whole new level anxiety/helplessness situation. concern lot people going read information immediately decide worth fighting catch virus. understand want scary get idiots refuse wear masks wear them, may also inadvertently scaring people making irrational unfortunate decisions health alternative told they'll either die they'll permanently altered lesser quality life. need accurate, rational information common is-- understand new thing information yet, important share information get people wear masks stop happening people. enough tests. already neat current capacity due recent outbreaks. conversation using testing bring elementary students back since disruptions years set kids back decades.

College kids though... one year online learning going make big difference. paying them? gets angry wear inside house. skin also damn near destroyed soap washing sanitizer would kill Concentration camps force concentrate facts heads explode! Saying Trump hands worst president ever kind ignored president's actual genocide Native Americans sure vary. Possibly enforced areas. work nights healthcare worker mostly doable family... though break sleep chunks help monitor sons progress tiring.

The reason mention son autism got visit CPS told teacher left home alone made grocery store run. real risk losing kiddo even cps take action. visit unnerving. went kitchen make sure stocked shelves (we did) nosed around. saw room, pet cat, lots food really pretty area live took real actions. fact super difficult follow check needed anything else signing agreement allowed left home alone even though 12. 

I worry parents forced taking risk (and leaving 8 hours vs 30 mins) bind outcome wont benign mine was. plan would **everyone** starve, since you’re incapable basic math biology. 

But presumably idea women locked baby factories gives erection, nothing else matters. disheartening everyone shutdowns STILL end hospitals hurried life/death triages &amp; bodies spending several days line cremated/interred. :( Doctors wear surgical masks stop bacteria, many times larger virus. Yeah, hear you. there's handful places country hotel/convention center/sports complex big enough host something like this.

A lot red areas open protests (mask opposition) hardest hit counties (OC, IE, LA, FRESNO, SAC) helping spread mask compliant areas. 
Also, opening cluster screw airborne anything short N95 small chance protecting Hey days I’m pandemic expert, days geopolitical expert some, I’m defence expert. see reports Italy? exactly position month ago! Beds corridors, doctors working 15h per day, caos hospitals... want also future. one thing mention though. let mask reason stay home sick. past, got cold flu would stay work moment started cough sneeze - would call quits impacting others well. future, yes wear mask go home start cough sneeze. Yeah call alcoholics, use live one describes perfectly. zero sympathy fucks beach weekend need bed next week.  forget schools run local school boards full MAGA hacks use board make dicks feel bigger get themselves/friends school contracts. active interest flexing Trump ""hoax"" enforcers local schools now.

Then comes surge hospitalizations (looks like moved stage)

Then come surge deaths. 

the big huge amounts cases weeks old now. Deaths take 4-5 weeks fully play get official records. 

Just paperwork, certification, adding official reported numbers take weeks person dies COVID-19.  Wow yeah sound strict enough. Make sure wearing mask times washing hands! get wear masks sitting down. Wearing mask youre moving around hard part, sitting still mask relatively easy 🤷‍♀️ Ojalá que usted podrá mantenerse sano salvo Seems legit. also wonder timeline. research suggests lose immunity virus couple months. that’s March + people trying wear masks etc. long exposure test positive? ""Teachers servants heart.""

Like wtf. Yeah usually multiply reported cases 10 see are. may closer herd immunity people think.

The sad thing is, true, going lose least 1.5 million people virus, maybe ten times long term health issues surviving it. agree. memory past three months. want bad things happen. have. thing. optimistic recalling past bad thing.

There's little good news here. US let pandemic destroy citizens, economy. I'm sorry. I'm ready celebrate yet. almost nothing here. So, yes, lower death rates good. time, entire countries locked fewer third cases reported state (and mine still 50k).

Yay we're losing ""only"" 500 people day. thing grateful would virus mutated weaker. fuck it.

Any help appreciated! get fresh air home? lot people stand benefit short-term denying sort stuff. oligarch keep safe castle, peasants stop working he's trouble. Denying virus exists letting thousands largely poor people die fact tremendous strategy concern value investments.

The true climate change. bad economically long-run (to clear we're already approaching stage, denialism old) short-term denying allows small group ultrawealthy scum loot earth remaining value. Nah, doomed n 90's Newt figured break it. surgeons wear masks? protect you. protect them. election occurs depends previous one. election moves system away stable center. example, republican party never trump. go back center. moves right. drift probability occurring. time occurs accumulates drift. Eventually, accumulates much drift state changes revolt. revolt state dependant previous state probability changing state increased successive cycle elections. 

I think governments bounce crazy stable crazy stable. think accumulates crazy burns revolts occur occurred throughout history. think Markov chain. cycle increases probability state change. state change goes stable revolt. election brings us closer current way elect government pushes governments campaign previous elected campaign cranked 11. drift center get closer revolt crazy parties vying attention. contracting covid-19, 5% died USA. worries, we're gamblers right? aware, struggle believe large number people travelled Idaho order get tested Corona virus, even travelling way numbers shown indicate large increase cases occuring elsewhere people moving Idaho. 

Furthermore would love evidence seems unlikely people would travel away main residences Corona. 

As point 2 weeks struggle agree. article detailing measures eased US 2 weeks ago. nearly 8% population protesting undoubtedly contributed rise policy easing much likely cause since impacts 100% nation(or least states changes occured). 

If claiming protests cause we're flare NY?

Furthermore UK indeed bad first wave. However compared US better. look research heard immunity would realise ""poor man's"" version wildly ineffective. really sucks COVID-19 also disproportionally affects come lower-income areas lot already deemed essential workers able WFH. result, less likely able take sick days adequate health insurance. Additionally, Black Americans hit hardest COVID-19 directly correlating systematic racism. Since food deserts neighborhoods rely fast food, leading comorbidities diabetes. Another example redlining policies result Black people living densely crowded areas. 

The argument correct going back school affect lower-income students' education students higher SES classes lack resources school provides absolutely correct. students bring back COVID-19 also hinder educational pursuits likely pick household responsibilities sick caregiver, take care sick, take burden medical debt help ease families struggle. 

I sure answer important discuss ramifications illness poor discussing ramifications in-person education. kinda scientific greatly reduces viral load get incidental contact. 

I think messaging problem people heard ""stay 6ft away everyone 100% safe"" message ""stay fuck home *must* go out, keep distance."" think many people die? goes back effectiveness masks. main mode transmission still appears droplets since fabric masks effective places. However doctors wear n95 masks due possibility airborne transmission environments. Airbone. 🦴 addition states opening up, there’s state border regulations. unfortunately either know saw people post FB/Instagram visiting traveling states holiday weekend. Kids maskless Sweden since beginning pandemic. social distancing we’ve dropped need ICU beds 80% since peak. Masks kind magic wand. can’t distance enough (metro) masks help they’re solution. know covid isn’t airborne like shingles measles. complete bollocks. latest research shows kids contract COVID-19 quite frequently, transmitting often dying complications.

 

Although rate may less senior citizens still dangerously high, kids die acute COVID-19 itself, they're also dying Kawasaki-like illness. fact recognised one biggest mistakes New York City made early pandemic (and one reason city hit hard) failure close schools earlier, became major vectors transmission. reason initial (now known misleading) complacency kids tend respond differently COVID-19 infection often florid, acute symptoms early on. seem harbor virus anything may even severe long-term reactions like Kawasaki-like disease. 

 

It's like ticking time bomb reports kids diabetes Type basically induced COVID infection. Stop spreading complacent misinformation this. Even without covid 19 that. Like said, expert. certainly learned quite lot N95 masks last month starting nothing working way novice.

In normal times, wanted buy N-95 mask would go home depot ask advice. know buy online, would easy prepare something looks like N-95 mask not. would know?

I desperate need N-95 masks. buy boxes Home Depot sold out. use much. Mostly stay home. would risk buying imposter N-95 masks. wait Home Depot (or trusted source) stock again. dare putting people risk!! idiot. couple weeks ago think California would topped, looking like could happen within week, that's rather impressive since California nearly twice many people Florida. look douche nozzle Elon Musk Tesla. Bottom line, doesn’t care. live Maryland Governor Hogan phenomenal taken seriously beginning. Time game theory. Let's say know masks work (we know work statistical prospective let's ignore now). 

You either wear mask either work don't. 

If wear mask work, saved lives. 

If wear mask work, mildly inconvenienced. 

If wear mask work, may kill someone. 

If wear mask work, might little comfortable. 

Do see wear mask even less perfect data? It’s fatties.

Why one talking fact everyone hospital fat shape.

At least every young person see news LA hospital big ol fattie.

Maybe I’m addition masks encourage everyone get fit fast Rona coming fatties.

Prove wrong. work planes, way works air compressed engine fed cabin. regulation system keeps air pressure cabin constant dumping air valve. New air constantly pumped 'old' air pulled out. Plus planes also HEPA filtration well. people normal get sick planes surfaces disgusting cleaned well. must feel pretty nice looking US Shame see people aren’t heeding vague understated advice.

Glad delegated responsibility individual citizens, dodged bullet there. blame politicians, reality, voters voted people in, continue despite what's going on. politician. neighbor. many tests performed? I’m early childhood teacher China, long lock effective guys fine. Kindergarten preschool last open. High school first everything monitored really closely. fine far first days stressful. USA definitely open schools August September though Deaths declining people locked down. places opening over, cases skyrocketing, reports lot hospitals capacity.

But no, let's downplay saying ""oh, deaths dropping."" Public schools are. already paid via township school tax Would able put shed couple thousand bucks? Friends glorified shed, honestly, anything gets ear shot kids. basement moldy, too, understand concern. finished attic long pandemic office there, work home year round. Even putting dormer head height might worthwhile considering. saying protests source clusters. think surprised health departments. outside likely helped well. Also, hypoxic person can't get simple oxygen, die suffer brain damage. Many, many need supplemental oxygen without ICU support. still die without help. point, death rate approaches confirmed CFR. media coverage years CA fires.... idea inmates used firefighters feel bad students college completely optional paying go there. customers. enough students collectively decide want pay tuition show up, school choice change policy. Vote dollars feet. paying $33k/yr put danger?

I feel bad professors staff school, job. need show earn money pay bills.

That said, great see staff students opinion. completely fucked administration ignoring them. Yeah study actually seem saying anything anyone who's paying attention already know. said along linger air right circumstances. Sounds like lot excuses remain frightened think yourself.  law makes weed illegal federal level. order make someone quarantine state level refuse voluntary, court order generally required don’t disagree situation manipulated overblown. don’t disagree comments elsewhere math/statistical insignificance. might know much corona, know awful lot pneumonia, cause scarring lung tissue. also draw many parallels symptoms current corona SARS1, well studied. data probably warrants kind action quarantine idk Fuck America went half ass lockdown couple weeks said good enough. reaping consequences know ‘biological material’ weight density vape types?


There’s lot important variance you’re throwing away make point. genuinely know talking about. going need little specific.

What ""add in"" wrong, correction referencing? Yeah, problem abusive morons.

Also moronic: Thinking teenagers business working ice cream parlor.  really necessary? Articles like others pointing myriad issues recovered patients dealing could end bigger story fatalities. Especially certain conditions can't treated become life-long/chronic. Don’t think people typically would experience days symptoms prior tested? doubt it’s right day positive test = first day symptoms. air conditioning everywhere north. We’ll get fucked time. Good thing always wear huge ass glasses lol lockdown buildings right? help understanding see articles titles like this. buried end pandemic, testing focused patients worrisome symptoms, typical lag case death reporting week two. diagnostic testing widespread, interval widened.

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile rest article talks change demographic infected, fact know treat disease process better, etc - sure, possibly valid points but, arguably, quote significant highlighted everything else following. stated purpose ""you need mask"" ""doctors healthcare workers need first enough.""

No, remember surgeon general's tweet masks effective preventing public catching covid.

Stop trying gaslight us. sympathy empathy homeless people make poor life choices, get hooked drugs, end homeless? liberal [archive link anyone trouble accessing article](http://archive.is/XaFez) conservative exactly correct. cannot 'school school' issue proposed budget cuts 'business usual'. public national (global) health issue. Teachers need grow pair. Get back work like rest us. I’m Florida. lot polls sent June things took significant turn worse. true. We'll two weeks. What's scary increase positive cases. Regardless lower death rate, still deaths find way many positive cases. expect that, 3.3 million would die, could continue desires unimpeded suffering others.

I've seen first video love nurse presenting video. combination mid-western accent (throw tryaash) mom-like explanations helpful information great combination. definitely going listen lol. I'm still feeling skeptical - that's believing somehow get better worse w/o explanation happens.

Are worried immunity won’t last long ? master plan, work, sell excess Trump huge profit ? I’m sad see what’s happening colleagues US. $50k ED bills money buy $5 N95 staff use? Hell, make $50 it’s still 0.1% cost visit!  husband Ontario native Canadian citizen Apparently turns out, Americans special breed MORONS.

No wonder get infected die like herds! Even FULLY selfish, would want burden hospitals already are. smart waste resources reason?

I seriously question people's ability think slightly 'big picture'. don’t go drive testing stations? don’t go hospital get tested. lol, I’m talking point time Ubereem lie cease allowed. whole feed full people saying it’s fake news &amp; virus political way get rid Donald Trump.....Florida FUCKED hospitals reach capacity.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Apparently whole country eight cases yesterday, anyone believes Lucille Bluth knows what’s up. map. 
I met older client day (mid 50’s) said virus hoax. 
As mad was, laugh say couldn’t afford take chances around elderly parents. 

It’s young dumb people. Suppose lock entirely, suggesting. end goal? long would propose? keeps food table time? never said that, you’re assuming. They’re saying muslim countries centers determined they’re committing genocide. question many times could that, one yesterday/friday one going do? animal trials months now. something comes couple months, safe probably effective.  may end suffering coronavirus infection rest lives. really know enough virus yet say certainty, think likely long term damage causes symptoms throughout one's life. Given culture, likely say silent. Rather bring issues up. Also due work intensive culture is, likely go 2 work long hours rather take saftey precautions.

Finally, economy got hit hard. olympics, tourism export losses well. Especially considering 2020 going big year them. know can, house big enough 61,099 deaths.

Still far cry US now, ""season"" started south. news helpful US efforts limit virus spread sure... matter, still groups people said they're going Alaska found otherwise. Alaskan not, can't lie, they're getting fined. United States spent $2 trillion dollars get Covid-19 control. 

This money used shut economy country could put measures place get curve manageable. 

Measures a:

- Setting robust contract tracing system.

- Making sure there's enough tests spikes detected. 

- Coming soft reopening plans.

- Making sure people wearing masks, social distancing, penalties failure comply. 

- Government outreach ensure people page vigilance done. 

A lot states massive spikes ***have done measures*** half-assed them. 

Which fucking shame. states took headstarts, minor outbreaks, money meant help them, pissed away. know you’re going hate advice might isolate man. clarified ready then, looking Mayeb take one get flight ton people cramped small location recycled air That’s great, principal said isn’t “mask man”. Good thing scientists know this! problem politicians understand it🤔 yep, gonna happen mean month since protests started NY noticeable spike yet. going kick car accident victims, heart attacks, transplant patients? won't. local park Soflo last week. Playing basketball kid. two wearing masks playing court far others. Tons tons teens packing two courts, hanging pavilions, chilling cars. Even caution tape wrapped around playground equipment still managed rip sections fooling around it. 

Young people around apparently think affects them. median age infected keep going down. allowed use thermometer? Businesses, institutions, schools call staff ""family"" always seem underpay employees. Gee. (Overall immune health) closely correlated Vitamin deficiency. continue deny science call Dumb? 

I bet supplement Vitamin know levels, you? so, levels? This. bad now, stressed enough fast get away us. average hospitalization period 10-13 days, every new day hospitalizations go 11 days back see many beds, average, freed up. Combine exponential growth, effective lockdowns still place, July 4th weekend, next 2 months going absolutely brutal. Mangrove crabs real harmless. going minute lol. Huh? Take step away Internet, dude. ready start snarky argument comprehending wrote. IMO public transportation factor density. NYC dense, weeks/months also crammed buses trains together daily. Florida much people drive cars. tell happen! think scandinavian countries well still fair share uhh, bright people Canada too. However, collectively, taking lot serious Americans, faith governments. levels government handled pretty well, regardless political affiliation, think makes big difference. Make sense it? stop. really seeing fuck ppl doing?

Oh don’t daily fraps live cannot go anymore. Oh haven’t day I’m dying. go day. might add hookup culture list pandemic casualties 😂 Oof. Somehow seems even worse. know better. brainwashed. choose wrong thing intentionally D: might true overall, certain demographics going get hit harder others. 5% among 65+ demographic would insane, well within realm possibility. Especially hospitals start getting overwhelmed. Pubs go back hundreds years.  FUCK Gilead. worrying like flu means taking seriously anything kill you. hysteria outside gatherings tens thousands protesters filling streets? 🤔 can't , teach Oxford Germany here, we've lovely weekend. Big party lake (up 100 people group outside), got catch lot friends seen months. daughter FINALLY went back kindergarten 1st, basically best 3 days life! Masks still required shops things, people seem respectful wearing them. movie theaters closed, lives would pretty much back normal. 100% joking. I'm immuno-comprimised wife works nurse vulnerable children. We're taking seriously anyone circles, family friends alike. left house since February except grocery shop. Going Canada would great surrounded people also taking seriously. reporting heard Imperial County, California.

Virus transmission coming across border Mexicali. doesn’t mean people hospitals aren’t residents. Imperial County likely hard hit impoverished lacks good healthcare encouraging healthy habits. Clean diet, exercise, limit alcohol consumption, sleep 7-8 hours night, get vitamin deficiency test supplement accordingly. completely viable gov. would simply pay citizens bloated military budget. even argument? asked question it’s know forum anyone questioning Rona arguing yet morherfuckers never gotten virus.

Should quarantine social distance vaccine out? Since virus thrives colder conditions imagine it'll worse major action taken. Well colour fucking surprised. portion used everything else. long takes, mean, 2 years, 5 years 10 years. realise unpractical is. creative solutions realise live country rains year. Will, one surprised gun owners start turning GOP politicians. They've voting self interest many years would stop beaches stay open, everything else closed. strategy worked Florida early reason deviated people going beach put money pockets big businesses. Well, proof ""auto removal bot"" sub complete utter horseshit. goes around removing comments good reason whatsoever. texas facing much 30 day shutdown right now. latter believe, state's control in-network private insurance. Agreed, central Florida native (moved state work years ago). soon heard Florida responding reduce spread covid19 spring began fear FL going complete &amp; thorough nightmare worldwide access vaccine. 
I really wanted proven wrong 😭 
I fear FL going vivid medical hell least early 2021. posting every single day isn’t making viable. I'm sure ""rick6787"" knows better mayor austin harris county's chief executive wish states would put mask mandate place. NH local grocery store require them. weekends okay, 80%-90% wearing masks crowded. perfect, better places.

This past Friday disaster. people usual wearing masks way people store going socially distance.

It enough message store. reply essentially ""Thanks comment. We'll pass along store operations, NH mask mandate place optional stores"".

It's ridiculous. Whole Foods, couple miles road, requires them. power require private business!! Sounds like propaganda get people hyped coming independence day celebrations. feel that’s funny part movie. We've testing lot (at least Ontario) transmission spread virus confusing fuck people aren’t constantly watching. People want make sense it. Jeez, awful. can't imagine professors feel. Many high risk group. irresponsibility college kids could kill generation teachers. People US seem want realize enough patients, even modern country can't offer enough medical care. magically appear nurses, doctors, PPA, medication, on. Beds alone problem. 
 
It entire point initial lockdown example many EU countries: keep number patients manageable hospital care sufficient supply. 
 
If look Florida, 200k cases, 5% daily increase active cases... end well all. Remember NYC lockdown number cases peaked *they* manage. infinitely worse. thought India gonna vaccine August? it!? uphill battle one we're tumbling downhill. knew goes ways. completely support that. Something drastic needs happen people take seriously. blame states wanting right now. start showing people tough love, never get control. mad? physician Miami I’m scared . Everyone covid family member covid.
What public aware operating capacity like local hospitals shortage therapies . Let’s hope people start donating plasma Also, kind problem could fixed Apache helicopters f22 fighter planes unless want American cities look like Mogadishu. takes guys kicking doors standing street corners. normal people ""win"" getting military sign peace treaty, make life dangerous average rifleman, ridicule peers neighbors depressing, prospect kicking next door unpalatable, calling sick would obvious preferable choice. military might physically capable killing everyone carpet bombing cities, would anyone's interest. war military American civilians would gruesome everyone. Murica Virus. They'll 200,000 day soon lol

Just kidding, even 50K day would still reach herd immunity understand beach goers stay beach, go shops/restaurants bathrooms. used work ICU UK. caveat ""US beds"" statistic UK patients would put ICU, US admitted occupy bed years (think persistent vegetative state type things). He’s really good example of, oh it’s chinese, therefore ain’t racist. would completely untested vaccine. takes long even build immunity testing trials.

This dangerous nonsense. It’s morbid yet accurate form modern Darwinism weather forecast says 18C-19C next week - yeah, there's need make air cooler. world would better place someone liquidated entire membership Chinese Communist Party machine guns nerve gas. Sort like me. :) Tennessee seen well thousand cases week well. Odd though, rarely see media coverage it. reason like we're pretending fine here. 

Did lose money, something. they're fucking UNABLE

Fuck hate use unable mean UNWILLING. **Who made this**

I finished master's computer science Kennesaw State University past May. budding data scientist published deep learning research involving network security IEEE. home, looking kinds covid data. find good visuals interactive could see metadata certain regions. also like heat maps. decided make website people easy understand visualization covid spreading. website made using python django hosted Heroku. think people learn best visual aids. hope enjoy website.

**How made plots**

I made plots using python plotly. choropleth map. [Here look choropleth maps made plotly. maps use geojsons create geographic shapes counties states. [Here got geojson mapping geojson used counties found link choropleths. code savvy, [here code make data came from**

The Rt data came [the rt.csv file provided rt.live bottom COVID-19 cases per county data came [the kaggle dataset NYTs using dataset updated daily. population data came [the US Census Bureau data also found github code link above. Almost 1700 patient rooms facility converted Covid spaces. HEPA air scrubbers ducted ptn window wiring tubes ptn life support staged outside room. Suboptimal doable. exhausting terrifying fear heartache people Florida experience. know one (and since know two nurses 50% reckoning :). also credits homeopathy, confuses herbal medicines.

The nurse ICU/anesthesia plus stuff forget freaking awesome. Smarter husband put together (and spell engineer put heads together).

Texas. keep banging head every time anyone medical field compares COVID flu. understand average person does, we've learned lot four months virus number one thing learned vascular disease respiratory component world away discuss it. Normal, healthy people, elderly frail don’t comorbidities still infected spread virus compromised elderly frail people worry like death sentence. NM states mandatory face masks indoors months now. 

Seems work well....but population starting stop complying, starting issue.... Someone said New York contact tracers allowed ask attended protests, data might missing least NY. sure others that. thing understand protecting others also benefits results less strain healthcare system, letting better healthcare less cases also means government re-open sooner economy sink like rock.

Too bad people mental capacity see one step ahead. past 6 weeks definitively proved responsible enough partial lockdowns. Universal lengthy lockdowns option, dont time gather data, time. think social distancing (or least according /u/johal61) changing habits (like going less overall washing hands) probably immensely helpful. think masks extra important step cities since people much closer together social distancing becomes tricky. Toronto definitely needs masks. Terrific news. read methodology determine ""excess deaths"" find nearly black white would *think* be. show administrators case studies show indoor spread travel well 6 feet? easy-to-comprehend illustrations. wrong sort air currents dangerous, least fix windows opened interrupt ventilation circles. That's yes You’re smart dump dumb ass good idea bit problem. Eventually city might need streets back for...cars. really, think that's great NYC explore more. reopening must done, push much business possible outdoors, waive/lottery permits, require mask wearing within reason (can't wear mask eat time) try keep density down. 

I'm convinced options stay-at-home let indoor businesses operate. Checking search queries also responsive predictive. Yeah, sounds painful. What’s point?!? ""GA"" right front ""YMCA"" made double take. Knowing Georgia’s response HIV/AIDS, pandemic influenza 2009, don’t doubt all. Personally feel comfortable mask privacy issues world also time surprises anyone ? problem statements like really mean? leaves position way wrong even finding single person sick attended protest would mean ""some"" spread came protests. 

I would like see something says 10% new cases links x whatever like done bars / indoor dining. ""she think some"" shitty way doctor try present something really provides nothing say ""I think spread due protests"" would imagine everyone everywhere would agree caused ""some"". go worry poor ass finding livelihood pandemic, loser !

better yet, go hell burn forever, utter piece shit

DISGUSTING DIPSHIT personally believe wasn’t much “faked” (at least early on) “overwhelmed”. 

Think logistics counting dead early time period collective knowledge lowest?  fair, Germany that. EU, 28 countries. 😃 going say thing. appreciate us taking approaches lets even implement checking sewage water. unbelievable early detection system exists mass deploying it. Florida governor feeling dumb helllll rn Quick, Bugs Bunny - grab saw! many dies every year? clear, earlier comment definitely saying never go out/ stay household. I'm saying, going go around people household need WEAR MASK. problem lack mask wearing. Wtf?! doctor that? seriously faith anything anymore. Yes decided take 5 days testing area. 

I’ve exposed waiting 1 week test. fair, states need transparent regarding hospitilazation resources. make easy dispute number ""full"" never seems ""full"". hear ""near full"", something ""plenty"" space. hospital redirecting, something accepting patients again.

People need complete transparency here. need see services giving surge. departments get converted coronavirus wards longer available? doctor/patient ratios changes down? patients receiving standard Lev care? gone 4 room normally holds 2? never see numbers. Also prison system mostly private. get paid state number inmates. real benefit prisons educate asset repeat offenders. way Covid deaths counted different.

Politics aside, plenty Covid deaths either would say ""death Covid"".

They dont count flu deaths way.

If die alcohol poisoning flu, dont say flu killed you. died alcohol poisoning Covid positive, Covid death. live Pinellas, never seen state license plates 25 years I’ve lived here. Even winter population practically doubles snowbirds. Wait til tourists go home bring states. bashing success  covid.

But car accident. Shooting. Stabbing. Bar fight. Drug overdose. need beds too. Honestly hilarious nakedly corrupt every aspect society become effectively one little virus laid fact bare. *Public universities too??* point institution America burnt ground? Dexamethasone well. that's cheap drug. Used give cat breathing issues. updates thes numbers? pathetic disgrace.

but love solo trips Mike Pence reward loyalty answer - unfortunately - two part - creativity money. Americans shit-ton both, use benefit society whole.

Easiest answer - divide students small group, bring ton teachers (or assistants remote supervised teachers like medical interns), keep students spread one classroom small group adding additional portable classrooms needed (or use surrounding facilities used normal uses - sports facilities perhaps). Deliver lunches group, group gym/recess together well. anyone group gets ill - get tested take two week break.

Would ideal particular student? No. Would get majority students kind in-class instruction better throwing together hoping best? Yes. Would plan need modified figured every single school make work particular community? Yes. Would take ton money commitment? Yes. happen? - easier say wear mask, ignore making anyone actually wearing mask, shut schools couple weeks dozens turn sick, shrug, say ""we could."" Yes see point. 

But go level science here. 

The science epidemiology much predicting human behaviour intrinsic characteristics virus. Advice changes human behaviour changes many people get infected many die advice always based evidence outcomes. 

There’s point saying masks prevent transmission general public wears transmission increases end. 

E.g. refuses provide infection fatality rate COVID since calculated pandemic depends greatly whether hospital’s overwhelmed depends people act. known *for half year* now. Nooo muh freedumbs!!1 Wearing mask sign cucked Bill Gates 5G Coronavirus RFID brain control

/s That's part usual mechanics authoritarian regime.

If want change vote November. Isn’t also Scientology headquarters?  one could seen coming reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeealy starting reach lmao. Available pediatric ICU capacity 56.25% btw. long. Probably ~ 1% state currently infected now. cases become serious/fatal yet, hospital load probably reflects ~.5% population simultaneously infected. 

Texas hospitals close or, areas are, saturated. grows 3%, 4%, 5% state actively infected, many *those* severe cases die needlessly. like like laugh lot responses somehow detracks mind-meltingly idiotic ""points"" make. swim far enough good agree completely. Parents often use kids excuse. don’t kids, it’s hard refute. glad people like you, teaching compassion good whole good me. covid19 numbers two weeks two months, ever admit real number deaths. 

These conspiracy theories? Possibly true, I've seen links back one might assume would vast conspiracy epic proportions. RemindMe! you, me. make conjecture assertion, see assertion conjecture someone else consider dubious, often make RemindMe! remember measure assumptions &amp; beliefs reality. 2 years period feel relevant issue. pandemic likely primarily over, there's likely change administration, lot eyes numbers then, without obfuscation either half American current-issue spin machine.

Well said (seriously, 2 year old attempt understand ""facts"" convey admirably), 
""neutral/left leaning"" sources according internet regards CDC :

""The CDC lumping positive COVID-19 viral antibody tests together. Here's that's bad.

By Nicoletta Lanese - Staff Writer May 21, Centers Disease Control Prevention conflating results two different types coronavirus tests, distorting several important metrics providing country inaccurate picture state pandemic. We’ve learned CDC making, best, debilitating mistake:

School districts funded whether students attend, funded government. schools losing money. they’re losing money extend entire educational system would collapse.. that’s happening. It’s reality. America third world country now. 100 thousand dead close half population think leaders great job. US fought virus like fight wars. You’d small percentage deaths you’ve had. It’s horrific desensitised population become trauma.

True story, health care even expensive get services emergency care setting. avoid emergency rooms non-emergency care, so. want swab/test, decline “sorry street run bunch tests won’t resolve asked for”... Wonder meeting person came visit popular &amp; loves mother. people get sick. got way weight loss bang buck session, I’m sure. think Ducey DeSantos neck neck title dumbest governor america.  Americans care much infectious diseases going one country another.  
Most people tolerate 1 2 months quarantine economically psychological wise, right trade starting become great people. Roughly half people born extrovert simply can’t tolerate quarentine would rather go herd immunity way. Business can’t afford keep staying shut either. 

Now realize blindly go nationwide shut mistake, shut targeted right start recourses used flexibly focus dealing super spreader place like bars, events like parties protests. US system culture, nationwide lockdown implemented correctly ever deplete resources patience. 

The severity virus certainly reduced though, even Italy’s doctors saying it’s causing many severe cases March, it’s likely seasonal severity, infectious. treatment also improving death rate decreasing time. 

The big focus virus cause far severe cases late fall/winter arrives. 
If great news. Eventually might become another Spanish flu staying among us much lower death rate. Believing Big Tech titan enough wealth feed entire world 10 times doesn’t public’s best interest heart “ruhtarded”. He’s got lot money says big words, let’s give floor important decisions need made.

“/s” bad sure does.

I went thru Y2K (shit...most site look up). Afterward started ""continuity planning"". focused pandemics...and learned term meant.

We put work 9/11. couple scares kept training fresh.

I put quarantine early March. Cone Uncertainty learned training. 

Better overly safe time know much. exactly opposite people training do. 

Also note SARs-CoV-2 prevent bad shit happening. Hurricanes, tornadoes, monsoons, another viral pandemic coming possible.

CDC track potential pandemics regularly (about 1 per year last heard). 

America better next one. Americans showed every terrorist destroy country: Bio-terrorism. Plenty exist. small percentage, loud. Toronto isn’t taking seriously. ones selfish addiction seen partying. Toronto big population, lots selfish people unfortunately, also lots truly care. Remember Facebook college students only? stayed way... 74% Hispanics/Latinos, make 60% population.

Hispanics/Latinos Texas infected disproportionately high rates:

[Why COVID-19 disproportionately affecting D-FW's Hispanic “It’s statewide emergency Latinos Texas,” Garcia said. “It’s red blue. It’s Americans, it’s Texans, it’s lives.” that's whole point people banding together families, cities, states, nations, etc. Take care close first. idea fully globalized society sounds great research papers, people wired way. cook taking rest year reasons. lucky enough able save last months this. feel poor bastards stuck there. virus really contagious. outdoors making loud noises probably help, say many Europeans got champions league games, unless caught before/after games bars whatnot. Baseball players still exist outside baseball. Yeah aren’t really working. someone gets sick don’t shut line (I work production plant) keep running cleaning crew come afterwards. several cases. data back up. know 2 nurses believe mass vaccination though. feel like disqualifying, personally. frightening much disinformation Americans subjected daily basis. has. actual research paper day. can't recall exactly something proteins able replicate reproduce faster.

Leave Donny Don’t forget fauci lied us wearing masks jesus, went vancouver BC two days put 2 week quarantine, thankfully I've come something, test says negative covid, sure is.

I'm chronic non-responder always get two jabs, couple weeks apart hope best. I'm 56 years old. always wear mask would imagine recovery many people would assume return normal life Except dumbasses would (if similar lockdown even feasible here) respond saying it’s sham look low cases are! stringent lockdown even less people would wear mask post lockdown.

Yes. means lifetime trying avoid getting sick injured. Along churches. gonna ugly. read article it. symptoms Daily reminder Florida better shape reopened, minus three counties excluded re-opening anyway. 

My county, second largest city state, recording 20-something cases day percent positive rate well 5% (under 1% many days). We’re somewhere 700-1200 cases day percent positive 15-20%. It’s beaches (they open), it’s indoor spaces without masks. happens describe bars restaurants places, whatever place sells irrelevant. 

The county mask order that’s effect two weeks state shot new cases, new cases percent positive decreased. hope another month two we’ll see impact mask order. 

Wear. Masks. People. never said would undo anything. said would changes. funding provided based enrollment. states schools lost 3 billion funding first 6 weeks shutdown. also never said system would collapse. said regions parents different options school setting change post COVID. Younger demographic testing positive, asymptomatic milds testing positive, doctors experience trearing Covid, new treatments available. Probably combo things.  hear there’s new coronavirus mutation makes easily transmissible? Idk would downvote  Lockdowns violate Fourteenth Amendment 

Mask requirements violate Second Amendment 

Challenging someone Archive username knowledge never gonna go way 

A sassy attitude may work social circle, see right bullshit don’t clue you’re talking about. America seems say "" cares""  !?? Keep protesting going beaches people work save actually six-month rule. uptick we're seeing result people coming back work Christmas New Years. argument sooo much deeper this.

Annual cost $80,000. co-pay *only* $8,000. I'm indoor dining there's vaccine herd immunity. I'm okay outdoor dining, theory, still worry I'll downwind someone sick, worse, find later upwind asymptomatic. Lmao come dude deepest condolences. :( coworker partially right, he’s missing vital information (which also people missing). 

The real reason extreme increase U.S. cases certain states reporting validated probable covid cases. Probable meaning someone tested positive, anyone close person also tagged probable covid infection. 

The problem validated (i.e PCR-tested) probable (not tested, may infected due close contact infected) combined together reporting number covid cases. means lot increase cases mostly “probable” validated. 

This also explain massive increase active cases, correlated increase number deaths. It’s prediction may may come true.
How predict something like that? idea, probably predict it. read newest PDF file two weeks ago regarding Covid B.C.? lots info there. Yeah, sorry, wasn’t arguing. going “don’t hesitate, would go even further!” uhhh... cares bill gates thinks? family another country lunch together already somewhat jealous. make want step house anything. That’s insanity. Oh bode well. Yay Bermuda! Please let Americans people care congregate whether asymptomatic currently ill. Seriously guys, get shit together...

I see news supposed funded vaccine one source. it, theres catch it. That's mind philanthropist, that's mind businessman Coronavirus hoax. 

You're wrong side history. Get education subject plebes  Use alliteration...Southern Stupid.

That said, Americans general seem going Darwin Awards. anyone breakdown profession? I’m curious see many nurses, physicians, RTs, etc... Everyone died virus tragedy especially grating 700 people lost lives bunch fucking brainwashed Karen's Ken's can't fucked stay indoors wear mask. bleating troops yet comes people putting lives line stop pandemic country Maga hats, conspiracy theorists q anon freaks silent, actively relish dangerous stupidity. 

I know, makes angry partner nurse former military member two deployments middle east say contribution society community volumes bigger anything I've done. 

Thank God live functional country still makes mad seeing US suffer way. messaging, [here ya go. Seems entirely outdoors helps ton. Keep vaccines bill Registered Nurse, using personal beliefs contradict best practices reportable offense licensing body. mention doctor and/or report her. absolutely irresponsible practice promoting beliefs well established scientific evidence. manages convince enough people get vaccinated could also endangering lives people community.

Generally speaking danger receiving Influenza vaccine certain risk populations. point flu vaccines us healthier folk build enough herd immunity protect might higher risk category can't get vaccine, like newborns. Agreed! Much appreciated. definitely agree sentiment, argued it, told we’ll call ambulance increase cost even she’s willing listen us. seems bit better we’re keeping close eye her. think need delete reddit, lol. decade much time neckbeard reditors. practical way reach Hawaii plane. rest mainland, people still drive take train, instead flying. something like places like NY NJ silly. Someone could fly Philly drive Newark couple hours. Good god, sounds like torture...

The way US handled pandemic downright criminal. Oh got didn’t realize taking upstate ny see people obviously issues died, marked covid hospital could money! conspiracy!!!

/s

I'm frustrated. I'm done bullshit stupid people. honestly want start wailing face. Violence answer. Education is. I'm exhausted. one next Culinary Institute America, yeah. That’s one. said whole food court maskless people. even operating food courts right now? worry - far adverse exercise walk Canada. 

The sad part tons great, sane Americans. meet anytime soon, we're STAYING HOME. seeing ""batshit crazy asshole liar"" cross section population. covid hospital recently got cited DHEC giving us flimsy blue masks wear Covid patient rooms (the kind see shady infomercials). Yeah dogshit science frankly Given healthcare costs US would think everybody US would happy wear masks. point might made difference, around early March. one thing, betcha New Yorkers wearing masks compared Floridians. people need worry about, park. Yeah. escalated 'arm sore couple days' 30 years ago, full systemic reaction puts back bed. hyper-active immune system. roughly past 25 years without nasal steroids, mold allergy season gives flu-like allergitis. Rather sick weeks months every year, take inhaled corticosteroid. wife signed put danger. sign risk life life life newborn taking care people selfish wear God damn mask. say two that's see, potentially fit next year. friends. family. can't even go store think safe others wearing mask around me. can't even ""be safe"" bit go visit parents shortage personal can't take time off. signed that.

If gets it, almost certainly someone feels like deserves because, like said, signed it, I'll almost certainly get it. point need give newborn someone watch potentially two three weeks pray one us lives take care him. 

So yeah, make quip. Bet felt clever. Nice job. Upstate really it. reason pretty strong theres really travel tourism speak of, people people relatively spread out. certainly share mask dissenters, definitely reach 80% wearing (usually trip walmart count one hand masks) end started months ago Yeah. want Guinea Pig sort thing all. listen podcasts

Let guess... Joe Rogan Rush Limbaugh? Something tells right around late October US ultimate vaccine ready distributed everyone wants one two weeks .... trust you’ll see, best vaccine. Totally beautiful. Maybe need Tiger Blood. Charlie at?! Im originally Napa. talking Oxbow Market? uncle thought pray god broke ankle twisted 180 degrees around.

He also nurse. Dont understand anti-mask protest city today

That incomprehensibly stupid. Yeah, government come obvious solutions often. seem like good solutions, could even checkpoints along way keep everyone path. Thing numbers low risk pretty minimal, outside crowded. Bill Gates could go screw vaccines propaganda bs, imagine listening crap coming computer guy. Go away Bill! parents wear masks pretty well. also believe impenetrable barrier.

Went crowded party weekend. proud tell ones wearing masks. love we're still pretending we'll sports fall Texan here, make least months *\*tips hat\** crazy? can't ignore health crisis even purely care money. Killing population results less money! [Emerald Isle, NC No. would make hard feed crippling videogame addiction tho Oh shit. go.  lowest number daily deaths since march 23 would argue entirely rational since gates advocated using vaccines means depopulating planet order reduce global warming. Brag much, asshole? Ffs! Enough already 2020! 1000+ death day normalized Brazil. ppl dont even care anymore things stay like get vaccine dont insurance, contact local hospitals finance department sign programs grants have. Sliding fee scales common public hospitals. Also, Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC) receive federal funds required law sliding fee scales co-pays low $0 - $20. Find local FQHC. ""Incredibly ill""?

Incredible. Noun. Impossible believe.

Way flat make shit up.

The actual quote article:

""is feeling great""

That's pretty far cry ""incredibly ill"".

Stop superimposing fears feelings onto facts. think virus community extent gathering poses severe risk point. COVID-19 mutated even transmittable

A small silver lining viruses generally mutate less deadly. Rather, mutations less deadly ones take over. 

If virus deadly, kills host spreading optimally. less deadly strains tend spread become new strain. Way simplistic. way much conversation bothered Reddit. curious though, ever been? ""I'm anti-vaccine nut job""

*proceeds talk vaccines stupid pointless* Legally.

It would even funnier somebody came like “party boy” Jackass boombox ripped pants reveal man thong.

Least that's batshit crazy co-worker said weeks ago. people die everyday doesn’t mean shouldn’t least pay respects people died serving us... says 250k 500k people die flu year globally. Assuming six billion people got vaccinated (unlikely theoretically possible based production) .00001% doses resulted fatalities, would 60,000 deaths seems incorrect. Although actually vaccinated 6 billion people, flu deaths would drop likelihood, since even countries highest vaccinated rates flu vaccinate 70% population flu, many countries, like US, much lower. 

A flu vaccine given six billion people .0001% fatality rate would kill 600,000 people would par bad flu year.

But .001% fatalities would six million deaths obviously, would much much worse flu. 

COVID though killed 500k people less 5 months pretty aggressive measures countries. Given that, seems like risk tolerance vaccine somewhat higher flu.

With said, I'm type person wants many vaccines anyone give me, I'm high risk group coronavirus, even take vaccine tested month humans. Social media, including Reddit, was/is mistake destroyed soon possible. Think batshit cultural climate gotten since Fuckerberg Facebook became truly, inescapably, huge ""source"" news countless millions.

people acting like fuck it.... I’m gonna hit hahaha way hombre “I everything right” important number report 77.4% hospital beds use. Obviously places like San Antonio &amp; Houston probably worse average.

There really little except staying home family, hope like hell numbers come down. urge everyone stay home much can, cannot, PLEASE wear mask.

Don't governor asked you. penalty. right thing do. CHOOSE wear mask. know convenient ... small, temporarily price go back normal sooner rather later. thousands suffer consequences...... Lol fucking guy thinking China reporting valid numbers testing three new cases populated country world. No. first months assholes we’re stocking masks depriving medical professionals access them. restaurant - even takeout - 4 months. That's pretty different pre-Covid.

Looks like I'll waiting lot longer way people acting. Joe Rogan entire circle degenerates need launched sun. wonder run massacred many past settlements. There's lot trauma past. Hey bill gates, fuck lying rat! opinion/experience, that's primary cause it. seems like primary cause flat stupidity. People either know cannot actually understand fact actions impact people. 

I would say quote 25 year old clearly demonstrates that. think he's saying gets it, get consequences. think he's colloquially stating knows get accepts risks. course reveals utter lack understanding fact whether gets virus him.

Bwahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha, okay princess, whatever say Lol expect actually know something? rest world social media, they’ve managed much better handling shit have. don’t anti-intellectual bullshit like masks pussies virus hoax. 

Not mention complete lack infrastructure prevent defend shit like this. Particularly disbanding pandemic response team throwing pandemic response playbook. guest! mention, people survive COVID-19 diminished heart lung function.

We need stand plague rats. Arrest fuckers fine living shit them. Fuck them. Can’t wait till I’m one them. Shits gonna get real months live. People utter jackasses comes masks “freedom”. rights. /S Yes, guy donating much fortune third world countries poor curing horrible diseases piece shit. blame them? virus airbone, lockdowns waste time, guess?

Unless completely isolate house open anything. Lol, yeah, that's happening. mean leads reversal taking seriously finally rollback reopening care bullshit is. want us take masks distancing bans gatherings non essential things seriously.

Fecal oral common community transmission vector outside home, there's kinds diseases we'd struggling with. completely unqualified discuss pandemic and/or public policy.

So exactly like Trump then? 

Seriously though, aside forefront epidemiology vaccine research, Bill genius. need pretty ignorant think know thing two stuff. guys think piece entertainment depicting pandemic characters care going went lives? mean, there's always character breaks quarantine, someone ""being brave"" wearing mask. true. know seen yet: possible reopen safely remain open. hope. Testing vaccines done populations disease greatest it’s unethical infect people test works— natural infections allowed. obviously certain African populations ideal testing vaccines treatments meningitis, malaria, AIDS, etc. populations stand benefit vaccines prove effective. sometimes issues informed consent due language literacy levels, people generally agree participate. 

Volunteers everywhere celebrated heroes advancing medicine, saved lives untold billions people. 

Too many African communities still underdeveloped undereducated. real reason many myths, skepticism, conspiracy theories things like causes AIDS effectiveness vaccines. also often believe crazy ideas nothing western medicine vaccine testing. Eg persecution albinos witches attacking people gay. social distancing? least there's that, probably outside, probably huge risk far things go. There's even shared bathroom problem block party people go home pee. think least wear mask share people know I’m shocked ... shocked! Nursing caring people, science. I’m sure there’s curve. need proper enforced managed quarantine, found February people self-quarantine. Gonna need fat ole source bullshit.

Please vote. Interesting thought, one considered. born raised lived entire life DC metro area. Pretty American. :-) often hear rugged individualism that, really come raised. parents taught success wave, one rising tide truly lifts boats. taught succeed, would rely others enable success. School teachers, college professors, managers, name it. maybe that's I've never oriented towards entrepreneurship. I'm smart well-educated, successful chosen profession, never consider starting business. never appealed me. know that's raised believe interconnected?

I've heard similar friends went Cape recently. really help lot tourists going lot summer, especially long weekend. started resident physician last week Florida. first covid patient lost toes many pressors. He’s still vent. I’ve waiting entire life doctor wake jolt anxiety scared shitless go work. sucks. poll done one survivor groups resulted 100% saying still wear masks. guys end killing Americans war Presidents put together 6 months. November cannot get soon enough. I'm devastated. I've saying since March schools next breeding ground. watched little girl 4-6 yrs old Target pulling mask &amp; telling Dad fell off. kids going sit 6 hrs masked? Teenagers sneaking bf/gf, little kids wash hands, pick noses. schools saying this, saying virus gets worse they’ll go online only.

They need exhaust options campus there’s justification parents pay full tuition, think ends online though. horrific bike helmet incident! play loosey goosey findings. simply pointing science whole loosey goosey discipline. 

Not every study will, meant to, produce definitive, 'useful itself' result. studies produce data *very* useful scientific purposes, used draw conclusions itself, especially laymen.

For laymen, care answer ""Will HcQ keep people care dying C19?"" 

Scientists meanwhile million questions like ""Does HcQ help harm people viral load above/below 'X' combined elevated sodium levels?"" need answer accurately answer question. 

Studies like meant answer scientist's questions better answer ours. plus everything gym people wipe equipment machinery constantly staff employees,which helps corona able set since everything showered disinfectant. gave three populous countries EU alternative?

No evidence potential benefit, evidence opposite. take-away message there, genius? nothing masks needing saved heath care workers. That’s besides point, since could easily recommended non-mask face coverings, eventually screwing up.

Stop fighting words - message clear, embarrassingly wrong. year shouting ""YOU IDIOTS, COULD BETTER"" screen finally hotseat idiot. virus big difference, know funny say that. 29 states even legally tell sexual partners HIV lmao.

Also, getting better treating covid. may help. Lag, testing capacity means they’re counting mild cases going unrecorded early pandemic.

\-San Antonio hospitals diverting patients nearby cities. Several Houston ICU's 102% capacity. VA San Antonio beds... 


All hospitals ""staffed"" capacity currently. normal day non ICU, given nurse 4-6 patients... even level get spend quality time patients run room room, charting, spend day ""putting fires.""  
Right almost standard nurses seeing 8-10 patients. Meaning admitted anything beyond upset stomach, monitoring anything minor, getting substandard unethical levels care. Hospitals given normal day mess strained running 75% capacity... most, all, hospitals populated areas state running 95-100% capacity can't handle load. 


TLDR: 
 Sh!t F\*\*ED beyond words. ""Just wait two weeks!"" said.  Firefighters signed fight fires, sign without helmets fire-resistant PPE. Please respect healthcare workers wear fucking mask buy Facebook.

Doubling per week, take 13 14 weeks inject entire country. Ackshually they’re switching “the flu worse.” really great point. I’ve sort thought before, never known articulate it. Growing American suburb really studying history, sort started understand ago we’ve really lived coddled life country now. think it’s important recognize that. I’m trying say live fear, life sucks. really nothing’s free besides will. darkness exists, anything happen moment. Again, don’t think people live paranoid recognize shit happens. Things end things begin. There’s nothing stopping it, opportunity take control mind, emotions, actions. Clorox wipes. duh. Thank defending everyone strawman thinks nurses die. Oh word....I'm sorry! 

I can't imagine fury handled. support system? I’m trying diminish number honestly expected lot deaths, they’ve front lines long jobs suffering health Texas hospitals already full. nurses, physicians too. I’ve seen many comments physician forums (so they’re actually verified) make scratch head. Take one guess political leanings.

It’s disgusting wearing mask turned one politics. It’s looking forget selfishness people think real American way.  Well played. Well played. Touché! America failed country

mah freedom problems then. Outdoor transmission rare. live US. imagine it. I'm surrounded it.

This idiot works immunocompromised people daily basis yet thought big deal come work knowing sick.

Thankfully longer employed unfortunately damage already done, cases every day still visitation granted. Yes better low deaths high deaths. Cases mostly 40s see tidal wave deaths spike cases. right. Context important.

事实上，美国人对冠状病毒的认知还不够紧迫

武汉有1000万人口，感染者约5万人，死亡3800人。

也就是说，每1000人中会有0.5个病例，0.038人死亡，但事实上，每个人的亲朋好友和A几百个同事加起来就是极限了，普通人根本无法感知，最多是听朋友传言。

所以当时的武汉看似危险，但两极分化非常严重：核心区的人不断生病，而非核心区的人感知力较差。

按照常规的计算，要有一个我们都认识和熟悉的人死于冠状病毒，才会有真正的感知，也就是1%左右!

换句话说，必须有1%的人死亡，整个人群才会有真正的紧迫感（这只是理论上的数字，实际上病例死亡在各地区的分布并不均匀，会集中在一个地区）。

以美国为例，美国有4亿人口，也就是说需要死400万人，才能让大家有真正的紧迫感。 Oh, also misunderstood you. see saying *close* indoor spaces. thought saying indoor spaces safe. Agree need closed, never $$$$$ guarantee know lol. Every one deserving title... Hero crazy always there. people aren’t afraid show second lockdown states. That’s real answer.

Meanwhile, today marked fewest number recorded COVID deaths US since March 23rd. Yeah pharmacists aren’t exactly frontline way nurses are. You’re spending shift patient rooms. religion science particularly mix well..almost like water oil

I've always disagreed say religion science compatible. Faith literally belief something without evidence, COMPLETE OPPOSITE scientific method. simple man. see CGTN, dislike. gentleman area yet neighbours posting crap like “only 0.2% mortality rate!!!!11”. 0.2% mortality rate, infected whole Canadian population, would easily dwarf violent crime deaths. mention morbidity, 0.2% mortality rate mean can’t walk kids without oxygen mask? But,but,but mONeYyyyy!!!!! Question 34: government stupid enough stick room, middle respiratory pandemic, bunch people, would keep breathing? Expound answer... Ah true! makes sense.   Don’t think little bit harsh broad accusation? Plenty Americans wearing masks acting responsibly, another large chunk opposite. Healthcare workers suffering countrymen’s ignorance, case country.

2, several nurses Texas wrong go without masks, city introduce mandatory mask wearing order ? China, enter leave community, go public places required take temperature test wear mask, otherwise cannot enter public building. Anyone wearing mask probably can't even go neighborhood, let alone hang out.

3. conflict nurses wearing masks treating patients hospital. done something right something wrong erase done right.

There mandatory law regulation punish people US (in China, call city hotline tell them). (Clues, city hotline feed information back leads provide). Expecting everyone consciously abide rule pipe dream, rules without coercive, punitive force never limit All. Cult Personality. Great song Made think comic point.

\* meh - pandemic peaked April across world. Yeah, nah. think it’s normal part job healthcare workers dying scores don’t know tell you. There’s always time better person, though! r/iamverybadass I'm surprised. many fake news conspiracy theories started Facebook, Twitter, etc.

People gullible. See also: Joe ""fuckhead"" Rogan Remindme! 27 Days Forever? try even year. hope masks become regular thing people feel sick yeah, think plan immunity vaccine.  Agree! Child neglect.

He also said incentive go work. make money go work. That's country's about,"" Trump said. ""We want create tremendous incentive people want go back work."" 

There hold up. design. would pay people stay safely home could risk lives profits? article posted says transmission close contact via droplets fomites. Droplets fly air ""airborne"". CDC estimates 80% flu droplet transmission. rest fomites. Airborne means aerosolized. Aerosolized diseases existed months ago. famous example measles examples 90% people getting infected room infected person (not close). second week go better? Cancel Karen Karen cancel country. This! like one dad's favorite dumb jokes - falling grand canyon (or substitute large height) perfectly safe, landing kill you.  world going go ""may"" face charges / fines / actual prison time?

6 months pandemic, honestly can't say people really know rules requirements now.

It takes one small group flout rules cause everybody go lockdown again.

Unfortunately, ""small groups"" usually number hundreds thousands more... point joke. Kim’s quote something you’d never hear Trump  people United States, order form perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide common defence, promote general welfare, secure blessings liberty posterity, ordain establish constitution United States America.

It's right Constitution: promote general welfare. big singapore? Oh fuck realise hahaha cheers! heard televise hot dog eating contest. falls many American's affinity excess, gluttony, spectacle. Viewed outside, bizarre.

The US misinformation problems spread lot themselves. Social media works people participating. People concocted weird conspiracy theories. voices given people. people choose say moronic things.

American's learn mass shootings. learn spring break debacle. learn Mardi Gras. learn every country case masks good public gatherings not. slow learners. may reasons slow learners they're slow. Easier drinking ventilator. much lost money. 

And yet billionaires corporations made trillions got $1,200.  answered question. People darker skin equatorial regions. Outside equatorial regions, would expect UV index considerably different. cares says he’s doctor.. mean panic precautions must taken. time ""unpanic"" ease off. death rates still crazy.

I would go back original post read replies, especially one ;

A couple issues post. First, lift lockdowns safely. It’s happened Europe many US states. Many states experience surges this. meet CDC protocols easing lockdowns reopened anyway. argument economy, actions hurt economy long run. 

Secondly, know little long-term health effects disease patients hospitalized even weren’t. 

The long-term effects pretty frightening doctors seeing patients younger never hospitalized. [This includes pretty long list researchers seeing. case don’t read article, here’s sampling milder ongoing symptoms:

“Nearly 88% patients reported persistent intense fatigue, almost three four continued shortness breath. enduring symptoms included, among things, chest pressure (45% patients), headache muscle ache (40% 36%, respectively), elevated pulse (30%), dizziness (29%). Perhaps startling finding 85% surveyed patients considered healthy prior getting Covid-19. One months getting disease, 6% consider healthy.”

And addition worrisome issues like lung damage, heart damage, brain damage, blood clots lead strokes embolisms.

And forget many discharged hospital haven’t gone home yet. sent rehab centers stay month longer get physical types therapy help regain strength learn cope long-term health effects.

Sounds like asymptomatic since able cycle 20 miles without much issues, going believe virus joke. someone multiple panic attacks month make feel like heart literally going burst chest, “sucking up” much easier said done. I’m 3 different medications - Xanax control panic attacks happen, Lexapro keep general level anxiety continuous basis, Propranalol slow heart rate. avoid going mow mask makes hyperventilate triggers panic attacks. Don’t downplay anxiety disorders. People go great deal “suck up.” Oh one play like ones we’ve already seen, huh?

Remindme 2 weeks! Rohan Portnoy *very* different individuals. Please, don’t compare them. small town there, whole region. could well come here, that's true. (USA) area, 95% people wearing masks. 5%?

Thanks Well least pizza usually goes straight box big spatula. good points. sunlight preferrable supplementation????  came across 2017 study differences oral supplementation Vitamin ultraviolet light (UVB) induced Vitamin believe might suggest supplementation fine prior covid maybe even early covid diagnosis; but, read study carefully see Vitamin supplementation actually UP-regulates IL-6 Immune response want trying avoid cytokine storm. want ""block"" IL-6 ""up"" it.  contrast, UVB induced Vitamin (from sunlight sunlamps) down-regulate IL-6 Immune response (while still getting vitamin ""hormone"" levels up). 

How exactly get UVB already hospital??? Take patients outside, noon 15 minutes expose much skin possible. Probably possible maybe doctors nurses get access UVB sunlight wands use treat psoriasis patients -- or, someone swing - get Sperti facial tanning box (they use lot Alaska get Vitamin light stimulation winter months). take much light UVB much efficient boosting overall levels.  (for example, Dr. Hollick, years ago studied concluded one tanning bed session equivalent 100 glasses milk). could buy wand too. expensive. But, get outside --it's summer --- that's best bet.

In addition, MAY one fall/winter bad idea sign tanning salon membership. even need get tan --- twice week even partial visit lowest level beds (where UVB is) need keep levels up. take supplements too...but nothing beats sunlight (UVB UVB). Cover face hands minimize aging want get tan look great winter.  easily worth risk year.  .  one us 10,000 times likely die covid skin cancer despite told, moderate tanning actually reduces overall risk cancer major illnesses. body designed get sunlight --- sitting inside day.

Here's study mentioned:  good health chances getting bad enough causes lasting damage pretty small, there's that.

This excuse gaslight public distract away fact stockpiles, hospitals run MBAs ""just time"" method maximum profits. 

Hospitals going CVS PPE, besides government could used number methods securing PPE supply chain customer availability. 

It blatant lie, caused lot death. I'm wondering also part fact US many employment laws. people still jobs still going even they're sick, people sick get referral testing seek treatment they're almost dead expensive even insurance, etc. key issue know dies COVID. Take Guayas example. outbreak 11k excess deaths 6 weeks. healthcare system collapsed. covid? heart attack? get inhaler refilled died asthma attack? died dehydration really mad diarrhoea? Pretty sure ment 0.03% 3% 30%. Anywho enjoy November. S/? Yeah, duh......... Medical professionals treated like troops. send bunch infantry slaughterer failure leadership, signed fight. wearing mask pure disrespect front line medical troops. see equivalent spitting veteran's eye.

The article give enough information evaluate case, I'm hoping best. That's know joke start. Lockdown been: everybody food medical supply chains shelter home. Alex Jones? can’t real. hate types people much next guy, would present negative way last message? Either way, infuriating read article:
""The memo says several companies told committee Trump Administration “spent many weeks pressing buy PPE directly one particular Chinese company” — BYD, Chinese electric car battery manufacturer heavily subsidized Chinese government — declined administration asking “purchase price fairly high.”

Well, that's shady fuck... still people die naturally Covid19. wanna say, pretty awesome okay wrong; thank you. I'm trying learn take sort moments stride difficult. skill, hard learn, admirable. 
[New Zealand claims COVID days later, they're finding Well lockdowns *alone*. Everyone wears masks. Widespread testing aggressive contact tracing. Temperature checks. even drones spraying disinfectant public areas. There’s lot criticize response virus, take measures, went all-in. places give ICU nurses 3 patients, unsafe number even relatively stable ICU patients. extremely sick COVID patients, obscene.

You're confusing fat lack exercise, fat eating high calorie diet. think right future events primary concern- seem small possibility knowing origin could give important clues vaccine development well. think it’s certainly worth investigation (in reality, there’s dozen scientists world would working this, wouldn’t much help therapeutic development world anyway. point letting talent go waste!)

All said- may spoken aloud, real, important, political implications origin story well studying well aware that. saw another user use word ""librarians"" certain group.

Real life doesn’t really offer opportunities *genuinely* interact adults niche hobbies interests. trend decades internet, honestly. internet break, really, good true. Like, talk anyone share things isn’t something would expect tolerated.

I guess reserve talk family coworkers weather. Like grandmother. interests anything pretty basic. final years stayed home watched TV time.

Sounds fucking great. people find doctors want listen to, Challenged challenged, side quarantine glad U.S. judge agrees so. don’t care property land there.

Ah, gotcha. :) federal minimum wage joke. positive note higher IFR least points lower R0. vaccine need effective gain herd immunity mitigation strategies work. That's terrible. unfortunately almost seem look like they're high risk. Old fat. rest likely health issues. Florida's reports consistently worse Texas late remember correctly.

WTF? say there's correlation Neanderthal gene severe symptoms? address fact tons people dying areas gene rare? two hour deadline? mean, I'm okay that, I'm okay journalist who's shite scientist, put effort man. could really good article. doctors nurses brought emergency travel contracts, nothing new. pay medical staff huge sums money move area work assess short period time.

But limit much slack contracts take up, many areas reaching breaking point, wonder much longer travelers plug holes.

Just like profession, bad people flat idiots medical world. Consequence Overwhelmed health system early days pandemic. Still problem Southern United States parts West Coast. thing happened Santa Cruz. boardwalk closed entire beach filled brim, believe eyes (and no, step foot sand). Even parking lot boardwalk open! family let give fun facts:

1. Hospitalization rate went 800% end May end June. highest percentage increase state second highest country 

2. RGV one poorest regions United States. 70% RGV residents afford healthcare. rely Medicare/Medicare walk ERs critical treatment. means hospitals financial margin burst capacity.

3. 2 larger border cities Mexico directly across RGV population 2-3 million people population entire RGV. routinely send extremely sick people across border medical treatment USA. swine flu broke quickly Texas 10 years ago. 

You add factors together it’s like 3rd world country there. state really screwed RGV residents start fleeing north cities find hospitals treat them. means medical capacity San Antonio Houston likely run next agast sickened wide spread attitude is. Selective empathy destrutive, know human species made far.

What kind bullshit this? idea kind stupidity going on. Problem is, countries mention trending downwards, whereas US trending upwards.

 

And US deaths going up. Slowly last week, fear get much worse next 2-6 weeks.

Also, convinced family stock food least month time. easily managed family 5 30 days without ever needing go lies manipulation keep us scared compliant That’s one many points start this. hurt economy x amount unemployed/uninsured racking debts, can’t/never will. Texas here, trying brave tf save economy, hundreds thousands people going hospital, (young people going hospital too, uninsured asf) really help? Look countries, took shit seriously sacrificed freedumbs better good we’d posted reply joking form auto mod deleted. wanted educate people may know reason phrase added 1950s. added differentiate country countries system USSR. understand morons get this, right? also everyone spread to. everyone enough freezer space hoard months worth food; need make regular trips buy groceries necessities. use something like Instacart, person harm's way person actually buying groceries.

The bottom line suggesting people nothing wrong also left die home. Fuck suggestion. Florida practically already reached New York’s peak infection numbers new York already lockdown month.  for-profit healthcare system system sees empty healthcare beds WASTED resources, important hedge capacity.

3. currently outbreak suppressed

For scenario 2, see Beijing suppressing outbreak people requires 7 million tests quarantining 400,000 people. Even there's less overkill way it, feels far outside North Korea's capabilities.

For scenario 3, like there's information coming country, [defectors sat look satellite images hospital busyness. point outbreak becomes impossible hide stacking bodybags like cordwood outside morgues.

God bless India one knows exactly many people died COVID-19. is, however, strong consensus undercounting deaths, badly undercounted swine flu deaths. numbers help explain why.

According worldometers nearly 30 million deaths cause year, 1.8% deaths due COVID-19 official numbers. ratio counted uncounted deaths high swine flu, 13.5% 52% deaths worldwide year would need due virus, completely unrealistic. Testing limited, nowhere near limited. hand, 0.14% humans tested positive virus, idea many 1.8% deaths attributed covid actually due causes ridiculous, especially since illness course usually short people wouldn’t counted died virus died months recovery. Also, contrary conspiracy theories, health department would ever count obviously unrelated deaths like shark attacks gunshot wounds due COVID-19 like didn’t George Floyd.

Honestly though I’ve become quite skeptical high end swine flu death estimates.

Getting really exhausted articles posts, simply they're targeting audience give fuck anyone themselves. ones reading us actually care. 

I'm upset efforts wake asshats, shock/shame compliance, lately like stuck Groundhog Day. Day day shit, lack results concern, day day repetitive day bombarded articles, news segments, announcements BEGGING people care fellow humans, yet blatantly obvious people Do.Not.Care. 

I dont know frustration. trying HARD hate humans.

That said, want sincerely thank everyone part, self-absorbed prick. bottom shriveling Grinch heart, thank caring.   bigger question China list. Hong Kong list (and quarantine everyone) China (who also quarantine everyone). much worse. don’t tell giant parasitic worm left lung. Well said

He sounds like stupid cunt quarantine 14 days danger here, though. Nah, backdating, atleast popular tally sites. Deaths represent announcement date death unless special circumstances.  Yea getting info Reddit doesn’t mean you’re last idiot get anything. “Sneezing wearing mask like shitting pants face.” ~ likely flu, year flus really going around strains vaccine. According documentaries, yes.

The detail remember North Americans cannibals. Brit, think speak us say happy laughter. like kind laughter someone anxious depressed might try hide behind.. really think bad is. amazing listen people's opinions first hand.

That’s 4 months stay home orders many people never even leaving home. possibly conceptualize numbers hadn’t locked down? lack discipline people frightening. I’m saying undisciplined person.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yup People aren’t mentioning Americans obesity diabetes. Denial fact unhealthy country. mention stupidity fighting mask social distancing stop spread virus pandemic. Ridiculous country can’t even pull damn pandemic. Well drop Nazi-style I'd say three reasons:

1. high mask use (not everyone still critical 80% level)
2. Japanese quiet. Unlike Americans latin people. Remember, talking produces blanket spray onto everything front you, continuously
3. obesity rare (4% compared 32% America)

I'm curious know many cases might really though. suspect many getting diagnosed death rate worse South Korea's.

Some might say going ""slow herd immunity"" strategy.... know cases people anxiety.  area would guess majority want to.  would interested actual numbers tho masks us wearing help droplets, truly airborne virus. actually, primarily airborne, masks advocating for, HUGE majority them, useless. Triads Chinese organised crime immediately called fuck stick right cunt told bugger Dr. Fauci optimistic possibility vaccine beginning winter. Vaccine development far humming along smoothly many scientists originally predicted. already 3 solid candidates heading phase 3 trials proven safe capable preventing infection among thousands participants trial poster may right. vaccines also already mass produced Nice  Plz summarize tell results assume peak happened also lockdown.

Germany around 7k max day increase locked down. announce total number new COVID deaths per day, go back backdate date actually died? wonder timelines look screwy, ""Today's"" infection numbers amalgamation people tested 1-14 days ago, ""today's"" death numbers happened sometime past week so. Fun. Simple. wore masks. Nah Even they're consciously thinking it, know teenage girls recourse abuse

They *are* consciously thinking it. vilest, cowardly worthless individuals society, best way spot them. Sometimes wish vigilante group targeting people mistreat service workers. Nothing special, healthy beating every then... pic South Africa article Arizona 

Who fuck moderating posts? sister nurse Dallas. furious people nonchalant fellow Americans. I've read there's suspicion political coup (or least change leadership) progress North Korea, speculation Kim Jong-Un may severely sick/dying/already dead. see remember new (hopeful?) head country sister Kim Jong-Un least family member.

I suspect story actually part political maneuvering. Whether coup succeeded failed, maximum alert would nice tool get rid losing side. It’s funny people called “Karen’s”, I.e. middle aged women. may case probably certain areas, majority people acting like Millennials, typically called Amanda, Ashley, Justin Tyler. middle aged people know take care impatient teenagers parents elderly homes. That’s it? Surprising. They’re enveloped everyday little PPE. Thought would more. want get sick die, let them. What’s one random persons life you? Lowers population. food rest us. best sitcoms ever: Karen /s one kill anybody anymore. experience far, people would scorn person catching STDs trying avoid wearing mask. viruses, except one transmits WITHOUT sex. 

Imagine logic. That's China's procedure nutshell. I'll never forget watching one cross streets Tokyo even cars direction. everyone silent wearing masks public transportation. Tokyo like going future. nah tewnties world didnt end. fix millions bugs prevent anything, congrats cant see kind unification happening now.

And stop acting like turdhole yourself. rude. !RemindMe 2 weeks come failed technocrats like failed medics stand US? imagine people would react said.

700 soldiers died fighting (insert enemy name) mitigation April 1 May 31 slowed time double, otherwise looks like back exponential track. percentage positive tests stayed increased since May 31, definitely is. pandemic research done now. biggest waste resources ever seen. really feel, Eatshitanddietwice? I’d country would I’d get beaten behaving like Nazi. 

Luckily there’s nothing proud country except keeps doors open tries keep people alive, healthy well. Sorta least. Still nobody defending even basic human rights, though. No, we're not. Probably closing mean lose things like medical insurance.  It’s meant counterargument, observation. context 18 million people died reasons person contracts covid-19 body fights, pneumonia develops person dies pneumonia, covid19 cause death? Thing matter look it, developed covid19, pneumonia developed, however, pneumonia reason longer exist. could saved lives supported people financially government supported people $1200 check instead handing $4 trillion bail corporations yet again. enough every household get $53K stimulate economy corporations need bailed out. Unfortunately sober drunk people US can't keep distance. know possible walk Europe S. America. Australia, too!

It's much, much cheaper go S. America N. America, especially poor. Shouldn’t trashcans prepping live work camps? Well needs take trip covid floor then. Exactly happened ! (I thought one) $300 per month pretty normal salary Cambodia now. know $300 per year figure comes from. worth, response here: . satisfying one IMHO. Np, would 8 million people Omg, never thought covid could harm dick talking death rate people talking masks. title. Death rate. infected, probability die. 

Maybe low gave massive amount hydroxychloriquine. think R0 densely populated cities? ""arm chair"" epidemiology currently cited evidence SARS relatively lethality must managed careful considerations. suggest agreement rather attempt argue unknowns then, advocate steadfast scientific management pandemic mismanagement happen again. CARES act provide several hundred billion pay medical care COVID patients? thought want people avoid treatment due potential costs, government step pay treatments (AFAIK). conservative parents family members state relatives mixing together. I’m internally frustrated them, think anything say fall deaf ears anyways. told safe can’t help feel like taking huge risks. would clean way clean rear end. Wipe clean toilet paper. Yeah people wear like chin guard like wtf man.

Additionally I've noticed many elderly people refuse wear one properly even ask them.

And susceptible. Post WWIII scenario Well... already know plot... arrived number based what? still costs thousands countries socialized healthcare, patient's responsibility pay it. Case count doesn’t mean much don’t compare testing rate. India actuality probably highest case count world far don’t enough tests. yeah, even year ago would watch clips jre laugh little. fuck guys. say shit. fucking stupid. reckon already getting control. Record daily cases, shortage healthcare supply bringing even tougher times ahead India. Exactly. gets lot really interesting people talk 1-3 hours typically find soundbites 10 minute interviews them. people clearly upper strata intelligence expertise Rogan pretty good job interviewing getting way, someone Rogan considers peer (comic, MMA person, celebrity, etc) worth time. I’m astronaut weekends, it’s fun saying things Internet.

Those pictures one district London it’s recycled pictures I’m seeing everywhere, town centre yesterday civilised people reporting story’s city’s. great one people choose guy opposes Medicare instead.  Americans act like countries country Send bill WH note says ""you wipe ass ever run TP"".. problem solved.. Since constitutional right trespass private property? That's GREAT counter argument.  It’s mysterious americand argument stale. Sorry break every bit bad they’re making out. I’m paramedic experienced last night disgusting, get people want blow steam like Black Eye Friday work. people wanted drinks celebrate lifting lockdown fine, obeyed advice went home reasonable time usual (thousand) ruined it. Violence, vandalism borderline rioting streets directed us police. NHS knees right lot exhausted staff nothing left give, last night people (the minority know) took responsibility actions expected others clean them. personally scared much earlier, started imprisoning children cages heard Trump speech clicked ""pogroms Latinx coming"" (turns wrong, heard lynch mobs speech).

Now, Trump feels he's lose election, he's trying divisive possible. made mental step think nazi, there's going back voting even sitting out.

So, please, people, make mental step – force people make it. still time take breather.

It's entirely possible good reasons vote Donald Trump 2020 good reasons vote 2016. please think really carefully whether reasons sufficient actually become nazi. forget elections, many elections, vote candidate represents ideas priorities without demanding become nazi.

Similarly, know someone voted/plans vote Donald Trump, please assume had/have good reasons. stage, make nazis. call nazis already, pushing role. agree please listen ask whether ways push ideas priorities without actually becoming nazis.

This off-topic public service announcement. Lol good job MuriKKKa. really worst country world right now. good thing medical school really cheap lot students going healthcare field I’d imagine it’s without social distancing way sighed recent polls 50% support medicare all, yet still picked Biden primary. breaks heart. also makes even pissed leadership civilian assholes still wont social distance,wear masks, getting serious is.

My sister nurse. new baby home maternity leave ended. nurse AZ right awful. hospital like shes middle war. basically choose get ventilator dies. gets work tonight told isnt even Covid floor yet covid positive patients. Why? asymptomatic. Yet technically covid floor doesnt get correct PPE. hospital treats healthcare workers fucking disposable disgusting. transparency. doesnt care work covid patients. knowing walking shift allowed use PPE ridiculous.

She every healthcare worker fucking heros. people do. options. Voting bumbling racist racist modern architect mass incarceration thus hand creating summer discontent options. I’m pretty sure isn’t earnest, case is: elective procedures weren’t cancelled lack “space”, they’re cancelled drain resources: suck nursing hours allocated icu patients (which mean shitty things like non-ICU nurses ICU rotations such) use valuable PPE hospitals states still comfortable stockpile levels for. Agreed, think punishing deter people breaking quarantine endangering others. else non-Hawaii license plates get there? would anyone give away privacy fuckers keep partying giving fake email/names clubs Zürich? I’m saying unfortunately virus spreading quick vaccine needs made quick spread rate corona goes down. still respect virus tho cause even take chance getting maybe spreading throughout family. I’m saying shouldn’t shut pros cons both, cannot mad people wanting shut cause people going benefits them. people work home going advocate shutdown. people shutdown cause lose job don’t want shutdown. People care stuff benefits don’t really care people like say do. !remindme 30 days read american healthcare system general american Corona response, appreciate little north european bubble taxes follows. found looking for. Days symptoms death (IQR) 
""18·5 (15·0–22·0)""

So half deaths reported within 22 29 days onset symptoms. cant really see predictions close really seeing deaths starting occur first week rise. ""Beds"" course simplification. piece furniture also medical equipment, qualified people operating it, space put logistics brings it. Bs article bs source. Natural selection Texas....:( takes extreme lack creativity compare policies Nazi Germany disagree. unfortunately feel like anyone would harass likely wouldn’t take time read bumper sticker, still appreciate suggestion haha. Yeah cuz fucking stupid. Whats problem? fact china handled 100 times better US? US failure virus? Things happen. less 10 cases per day. would lying, say 50-100 cases per day look less suspicious? nothing hide. Fuck limited minds. Oh, problem wearing masks. like stupid americans Yeah, although real message needs people quarantine. ruining everyone else. chimeric gain function virus already created lab back 2015. called SHC014. already done. compare serving someone they're gay, serving someone they're wearing mask middle pandemic?

This makes sense whatsoever... Yep. sub discussing Politricks gets creative. BLM protest okay though imagine... availability saud treatments medics poses greatest problem even need google it, common sense. way every single person ever got virus got fomite only. fast way spread. airborne.

That said, subreddit months back, tons people complete denial pissed too. like worked government something. upvoted well... thousands times. debate discussion shot immediately downvoted. probably went everywhere. Fuck, wish getting healthcare complicated, sick public health system. people want give everyone universal healthcare people want genocide large portion Americans? get 6 weeks year vacation time

I presume work way that. Like 20 years.

Because US jobs vacation benefits start 2 weeks. Though work 16 months get 2 weeks. first calendar year got nothing. one day vacation. earning vacation following year based started. whole entire second year, got pro-rated two weeks of, IIRC, 4 days. second year, earning vacation could take third year. third year, finally got full two weeks vacation.

(That, incidentally, first job ever gave vacation. Previously, even full time employee got vacation benefits.)


Compare UK workers work 5-day week must receive least 28 days' paid annual leave year. equivalent 5.6 weeks Yes left NC months ago cause everyone know strung meth don’t care school shootings... Health illiteracy terrifying. know shit works care know. Lol that's bro, missus blame going fucking party pandemic, are. I’m curious people can’t wrap minds around we’ve staying home 4 months hadn’t home death tolls Covid numbers would wayyyy higher. see reddit people continue argue death rates “low” 140,000 deaths far. People don’t understand think would happened hadn’t shut months. think numbers would be. Would hospitals choose life healthier persons lack space? People don’t care anymore.don’t think ever cared Oh good. Thanks. impossible close restaurants without country becoming chaos. Think way: imagine spend 200$/month restaurants, money would go buy food supermarket (50$), waiter's salary (40$) subsidy restaurant owner (40$) rest people involved restaurant services, like landlord (20$). government manage distribution money save money since business owners landlords would perceive business profits closed, personal subsidy. would bit bothersome cook food bad pocket, contrary. freedom... Dude, average usa citizen smarted pigeon Alzheimer! overestimate country!  Floriduh You’d surprised motivated Chicago dig fiscal hole. defeat stupidity. love No. 1 it! huge head start! expensive? Imagine highway stretched across pacific. 

Imagine endless drive across sea take money usually spend giving subsidies tax breaks resorts use give people rent relief unemployment benefits I'm this, time wasted tracking down. Give six months. can't handle 14 days, six months definitely send message. sarcasm? explain thought process? Two metres! Bankruptcy. first born. you’ve major care/recovery first. walk away. premie’s first trip bankruptcy court, tethered heart monitor. Lost house, started over, allowed us space breathe, bankruptcy. system predatory broken. understand point, believe parallel work.

What Trump basically Europe Spanish Flu. really, really bad, believe criminal (maybe lawyer around could confirm whether laws US could cover case? I'm fairly sure Europe) genocide. Even covid eventually reaches number victims Spanish Flu, two vastly different crimes. course say numbers going big election. Good them. long me, close family friends vaccinated, cease matter. Go hall make left, you’ll see sign “other viruses” That's incorrect. mandating 14-day quarantines people. Many people thrown jail violating that. count excess deaths, takes months tally properly normal recording conditions. places capacity count bodies, usually months later get counts. counts independent diagnosis cannot confirm given individual died from. macro level hard hit area, excess deaths good measure overall impact circumstances around pandemic.

Count dead diagnosed Covid, would died anyway.

More substantially places (undercounts common overcounts) capacity test everyone died delay getting information official figures. overwhelmed place reduced capacity deaths estimated. Processing data takes time.

With flu, normal circumstances, vast majority deaths officially diagnosed instead estimated months later based several factors. Covid part ramped capacities deliver information sooner, diagnosing much higher proportion deaths, simply put systems place get all. somewhere like Mexico, job much reach.

The notion need estimate anything completely wrong, every level. remotely close reality actually works. No, far normal. 400K dollar bill major complications. true all, real world results areas masking widespread prove masks effective. Sure, better masks work better cloth masks getting job done enough people use them. degree US  That’s happens elect rich people represent poor. confirm. I’ve known people it’s like never left middle school.  Tbf there’s country that’s anti-mask it’s America definitely comes American thing, outsiders least. mention bubble gets small fraction good players, wouldnt worth watching anyways giluidebiok

How type ? mention passengers Hawaii isolated respective departing airports could get freshly infected prior boarding. Yes, always dispose packaging, generally warm food be. advocating Dining restaurant btw, think would crazy thing now. Take me. Anyways, really understand science it, supposedly viruses like Covid can't survive multiply food way Bacteria can, needs get directly respiratory react cause infection. Supposedly can't happen eat it, goes directly stomach killed acids there. %100 trust CDC either myself, wishy washy things like masks on, feel like really alternative trust say. like understand vCard thing do, lol. thought whole point CARES act. Pay companies keep people payroll/ benefits letting shelter home. pump money it.

I lucky job kept us payroll month furloughed us benefits another. set happy stay home. ran money rushed us back. do, keep people inside welding doors shut hold gun point?

After past month, see police getting hands public anytime soon many wanting stay inside longer days. Same. Play games, watch sports, TV shows, eat good hotel food, nice bath. downside! they? many responsible adults think apply work ice cream shop?  public free resource study training got? common proper name used this? ""Disaster recovery""? ""emergency response planning""? something like that. would informative know least broad topics covered course. Two healthiest super sporty friends (late thirties, early forties) still seeing neurologist cardiologist 4 months relatively mild case. 2-3 weeks Florida start panic. Deaths surely follow spike. I'm Florida leadership letting burn ground point. can't believe I'm seeing here. Less half mask wearing 11k new cases terrifying. 20 percent residents age 65. condition good ""lockdown"" requires stable supply food/supplies economy back p.

Canadian, first glance, even recognize ""New Found Land"" 3 separate words..... said ""Noo-fun-lund"" (which even quite pronounce it), instantly like, ""oh yeah, mean Newfoundland!"" lol sure, go personal attacks now. Typical. bomb goes outside window shockwave shatters glass causing piece stab kill you. die bomb stabbing? Probably, problem exposing people way. would expected field hospitals triage non-urgent medical cases (broke bones, births etc) Yea went bike ride kill right? Get grip Karl. coworker told might actually chance home ownership house prices drop low enough. Oh play game, facts denial. DoNt KNOw StatIsTics WoRk mean, OP wrong.

It's starting look pretty dangerous kind sporting event taking place US long time. even rigorously test players, imagine ridiculousness sporting event crowd massive outbreak progress?

There's *no way* keep players bubble. simply much contact many people. No. result passaging. Please make sure keep telling that! imagery mind glorious. bit hard decipher moment. obviously seeing excess deaths part COVIDs official death numbers. could explanations these,

1) Increase mental health issues suicides due lockdown, isolation feeling hopelessness due loss job income. (Lockdown related suicides soared country becoming second leading cause non-covid deaths).

2) lot people would seek treatment early interventions treatable health conditions (say heart disease, increased blood pressure etc.) avoiding hospitals due risk contracting COVID. This, course, would lead deaths another set people due delay seeking healthcare.

3) stress pressure pandemic especially risk losing jobs income could contribute deaths exacerbating stress-related conditions like heart attacks.

4) finally (this relevant third world countries, maybe homeless population first world countries), deaths starvation due lack income direct consequence lockdowns loss income.

Of course, reasons may explain excess deaths. still extent undercounting going moment. hard predict much people infected COVID. could argued reasons stated still contributing deaths pandemic (albeit directly). way much chaos moment true extent damage pandemic estimated dust settles. stand corrected, definitely know statistics work. time anyone take time mental health surge. infringing upon women’s liberty choose wear dress public. important part... complete absence meaningful Public Safety Welfare reason so. course are, they’re ones bought toilet paper That’s Denmark, don’t massive pandemic raging away. Australia, states requirement mask initial controls lockdowns flattened curve. 

In US, I’d wearing p2 respirator Half mask, gloves, long sleeves shirts potentially clear safety glasses absolutely limiting outside time complete necessity. totally different environment world, certainly first world. thought worst thing spread crappy YA movies books :P 
The U.S. Food Drug Administration (FDA) issued strong warning consumers avoid using hand sanitizer manufactured Eskbiochem SA de CV, based Mexico. FDA says products toxic contain **methanol**, says acceptable ingredient hand sanitizers. Consumers use products chemical could absorb chemical skin ingest accidentally. Vitamin fish, maybe. Same. people know are. It’s old Fox News boomers refuse heed public health advice implement sound public health recommended policy. 

It’s like seat belts: took law encourage widespread use. chaddi gang done good country you, clan scions ever will. lol relevant comment, ideology never irrelevant Independence India now. guys crying daily basis existence. person selling foreign propaganda lecturing relevance. Nice boy, hope rule agree end costing livelihood australia's true ""second wave"" ramps intended* know work assuming country cases purely many tests another country higher cases. need look data context positivity rate.

Facebook falling. Makes wonder many North Koreans victims virus. simple reason applies countries. Nobody money lockdown entire country twice year without causing total economical social colapse. Thats large number considering many die every year disease, infections, needle sticks, etc. Goes line work.

[Occupational Deaths among Healthcare Give laptop, able make leave quarantine. Nice clickbait headline made there. hasn’t explained properly backed clear consistent public health policy old people run things. purpose passport happen?

sars2 possibly infect Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors

so zombie apocalypse far fetched idea, ofcourse unlikely airborne indoors* start $2k chargeable vehicle bad. I've thought airborne believe, number explosive real world examples devastating reach people even measures taken Lol deficits? Haha one cases that. 

Young people shown one cares future constant mixed messages covid leads think it’s big deal. (checks list covid-19 symptoms) Nope, think good... Oh well, woke free country, whatever like fr33dum.  would ideal brought many times past site, main excuse told simply would cost much. 80 people someone sick need bring someone else overtime matter busy contract states need full crew every shift. Right someone sick costing company $15-17.50 extra hour 12 hours.If sick pay would extra $45-47.50 hour. 

We tried push argument people stay home sick less people would get sick co-workers company would possibly save money since people can't afford miss shifts usually come work sick. without sick pay best solution would get sick people wear masks. unless majority people rest feel obligated shamed make rule doubt happen. America tried warn literally killing seemingly purpose front everyone, would know exactly do. *""Don't Donny does!""*

And response...... *opened* pubs? We're idiots, what's excuse? think understand statistics work lol Weeks? going need many months year minimum. think maligning country wait till find chaddi gang country love much. Anyway feel free stay relevant Covid instead supporting naatakbaaz baap's lies hear ya, Trump changing messaging “this something live with.”

You completely right, live Idiocracy. Go Starbucks get latte. might feel better. masks clear windows could wear face shields. Well live entire nation completely populated assholes forgot virus accepted risks. word got 50...hell even 65...there’s little risk dying, over. 

What population actually consider following? It’s politicians responsibility implement mask ordinances indoors. Young people don’t access advice public health department, politicians do. suppose support insurance companies refusing paay people eat KFC well? Yup. tests returning positive even percentage terms. means cases India, less. hospital, it’d $2,000. Don’t blame young people. It’s Fox News boomers run shithole country. Dude I’m glad page

You wanna go pint ? majority population. irrelevant snakes like bring unrealted topics world forum like shamelessly malign country. ISI stooge Tracking anchlet? ;D guess point either would reach natural herd immunity, virus would burn would become endemic like many virus. 2 weeks since surge 

2 weeks since surge BEGAN. still surging time symptom onset death last checked ~17 days. even expect see deaths BEGIN tick early next week...*if understood lagging indicators median age reported cases dropped 65 35.

Right ""If UK population US, they'd 220,000 deaths per capita comparison."" stupid response comment. standardized comparison (US UK) age time since onset symptoms, direct comparison deaths per capita somehow representative relative effectiveness healthcare systems' response covid assinine. little usual ignorant monobrowed sisterfucker posts picture Kan. (AP) — weekly Kansas newspaper whose publisher county Republican Party chairman posted cartoon Facebook page likening Democratic governor’s order requiring people wear masks public roundup murder millions Jews Holocaust.

And said Holocaust survivors, relatives Jews offended, would apologize means “no slight them.”  again, better anyone appreciate harbingers governmental overreach present tender seedlings tyranny,” added.

How dense.

I think take this.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Issue UK masks even advocated mass wearing, see photos, hardly anyone's wearing masks people social distancing. possible died coronavirus put cause death? 
How many healthcare workers US healthcare system? million example 700 wouldn’t high number 6 months. 
Quoting headline like generally needs looking into. 

Apparently anyone dying anything lately coronavirus even fall ladder onto oncoming truck, explode billion pieces That’s million dollar idea right there, Stars Stripes masks  going get really bad London especially next month two think. Thanks, sounds exactly like I’ve hearing. Wtf wrong nurse? We're celebrating gunpowder explosions. Yep, two thirds would lose jobs business fails, probably way less savings employers weather storm. They're outside masks on. fine know riots/protests increase infection whatsoever, we're good. *Sad media noises @ title. Texas twice many confirmed cases Covid19 Georgia... fever confirmed deaths. Texas must secret sauce burgers. Thanks visiting store. Please lick doorknob way out. Begging extended closures self quarantines.  First all, waiter definitely infected No, quarantine temporary person escape. Also consumes important PPE kits masks looking people. told give fuck statue lol. bullshit.

the US even close 360m, [321m good there's way couple million.

and clearly understand difference CFR IFR. New York state 400k confirmed cases 32k deaths, death rate 8%. well known far 400k cases, that's get true death rate, called IFR. IFR better ascertained diverse population (so mix high low risk people) death rate Covid always around 1%. sometimes 0.4%, sometimes near 2%, always *ballpark* 1%.

now, experts say need somewhere 60-90% population resistance, either recovering vaccine, herd immunity. split number, use 1% IFR, get herd immunity without vaccine 2.4 million deaths US. ""this year""
We're July right? 700 past 4 months one allowed leave home 40 days, almost everyone would die. Since masks 100% they're likely killing elders. remember biology class college, professor mentioned flu virus mutates vaccine receive well may different strain what's going around might protect all. reason, never got one last year. 

And reason talking immune compromised acquaintance mentioned this, got angry. like ""the vaccine you; people, like me!"" like sheesh right I'll give go. directly kill people completely overwhelm hospitals cause massive collateral damage, either. We're early stages new surge hospitals already getting full. stopped America? guys need look 2,800-5,600 years depending whether 4yr degrees 8yr degrees. Holy fuck. Alaska Hawaii probably happy separated rest states. people fucking selfish. good medical system either. Oh man, evil :) discovered coronavirus similar covid-19 virus 7 years ago surprise? assumed along? have. people think disappears air? hope sentiments genuine. I'm lucky still job moment (And hope still safe), us slowly realising every day measures countries like Australia parts USA taken far worked.

Look way: knowing know now, whole world gone lockdown 40 days start (nobody allowed leave homes, nobody flown country - meaning interstate borders shut well) economy would suffered much worldwide now.

(Yes, would need ration food etc... Millions last century survive. Twice.)

I problem going lockdown.

You think bad? Try talking someone lived Great Depression last century (If find anyone still alive). They'll tell suffering is. endured last Great War end wars.

We still first wave. second wave hit world either given fighting it, thinks complacently ""beaten it"" (while still numbers infected). re-open international borders.

When zero cases anywhere world least 40 days, know truly over.

I fear countries end much debt, go war wipe slate clean. Jesus would homeless pay pay insurance that. true, seeing way infections? agree data accurately correlates areas infection, anonymity towards data collected still leaves question who’s honest attending protests standard deviation didn’t make mention that. Overall hope gets finished someone due better due diligence peer reviewing it; think it’s going interesting study. instance, Minneapolis Department Health reported 15,000 people tested centers set communities affected protests, 1.7% tests came back positive—below statewide average 3.6% hey, least she’s dead showing statistics, everything fine let people it. /s article entirely excess deaths low rate infection Japan. Yes arguably misleading title, clear article death rate population, *not* death rate infected. everybody talking masks reducing spread right relevant article wrong.

Nothing article shows strong indication IFR Japan significantly lower New York whatever. experience. I've found healthcare costs (doctor visit, hospitalization, imaging, etc.) Germany run consistently 1/6 US costs. would airborne mean terms precautions protection? hepa filters n99? conversation possibility using new gloves customer, economics gloves general. need alive give shit economy. even know ""we need british summer"" - able anything since FEBRUARY, getting spring summer year.... Vents. centralized ACs. UNO reverse card better kindergartens. think terrible crisis hit us yet. new shape Virus south west. areas getting slammed. whole thing deaths following cases wrong. Deaths lag month more. Hospitalizations CA, TX, AZ FL. lot states, counties country.  Deaths NY NJ, yes. bunch states becoming like NY was. Hey, mention baseball? doesn’t seem, least, tipping culture issue much culture influenced servers viewed. lot people always kinda started jobs customer service based, servers, retail, etc. learn work ethics jobs expected eventually leave another higher paying job. customers think servers “earn” money work harder since job they’ll likely leave entitled customers direct control wages. I’ve lot conversations eating restaurants much tip server ‘deserves get’ based service. I’m entirely sure history tipping servers they’re still underpaid, however. Right? point that? neighborhood plant group woman made post ""yt"" privileged selling plants we're terrible racist talking group. I'm blm ridiculous. We're talk plants, trade give away can, promote places buy specific ones. one places left put current events side min breathe. look talk something else bit destress little? places functioning governments, said US right now. Hopefully remain weeks since spike cases week:/ even imagine USA must look Asian countries wear masks big deal like forever? No, need go Ikea. Open up! *has* joke. mentioned storming beach Normandy. ideal world solely driven money, I'd agree. still outbreak going world. world think we're going see sports outbreak going on. Top sports leagues made money TV associated advertising now. There's simply much money stake everyone involved turn demand watch higher ever. 

I mean, that's certainly argument owners can't put players complete bubble, though NBA trying, institute rules limit risk, lot testing identify isolate people get quickly, good chance stopping spreading throughout teams. And, least outside football, people involved probably safer going practice playing guidelines limit spread living normal lives own. 

The NBA going *much farther* way this, likely *still* enough. can't isolate people like that. many ancillary individuals making contact players. impossible. people still go home families. still stay healthy. remarkably dangerous middle pandemic assume things ""will safe"" putting measures place. Measures slide. People stop taking seriously, make reason NBA try bubble players hit NBA team 15 put games risk. baseball football deal positive tests players quarantined still continuing play.

And, referring first point combining here, imagine going playoffs LeBron James tests positive COVID. Earth handle that? unwittingly gives someone dies? NBA player left permanently damaged this? point push nuke button season start whenever makes sense so?

I think setting sports America take tenuous precedential step. results could extremely damaging, *especially* MLB who's players already come said owners really care them. Im sure dudes troll actually thick rationale get young adults stop partying Spring Break. guilt tripped they'd get parents grandparents sick. wonder, ever physician strike ever before? Almost profession God’s green earth go strike Idk doctors ever deciding, “we seeing patients today”. lot medical professionals know actually believe taking medicine, find pretty odd. They'll like ""I know side effects, nope, power migraine."" Like, Jesus. wonder know that's terrifying. can't wear shoes, get anxiety. timing also almost perfectly identical. March 22, UK 1035 reported cases US 8631 UK 5x smaller US.

so lazy attempt creating equivalence timing ""perfectly identical""... march 22, might well BCE coronavirus standards. early US outbreak. We're talking massive spike US new mirrored UK right now. That's huge chunk cases that's huge chunk cases WAY EARLY call death data.

We even really know young people take longer die. average age US UK identical count citizens opposed residents.

YOU nonsense LOL. I'm talking broader population (sure 38 vs 40 similar). Tell age breakdown covid patients themselves, that's age data matters comparing death counts, average age whole population. r/agedlikemilk According Worldometers, six states didn’t report cases 4th July, probably would’ve reached 50k 10% capacity charge whoever wants go 10x Watching this, would believe country worst number death. Surely virus causes complication another health issue, causes death, patient would still alive hadnt contracted virus, virus caused death? do. well Rwanda. need post facts actually relation other. example, born Corona. said technically factual useless misleading. Anyone reading would see saying caused Corona, clearly true. 

Saying rise caused marches instead easing lockdown same. Cases rose US protests UK cases rise. Furthermore cases still rising, fast across entirety US, march hotspots. blame them, nothing said innocent children paralysed vaccine trials. even gonna mention ones died trials. probably thinking gonna another disaster downplayed again. Hope happens UK US would get coverage. wish healthy lives that's quite eye-opening. thanks. back alley sewing shirts. I'm pretty sure legally allowed work. one known job teenager? would blame politics, papers/news companies.
Politics - want keep posting increasing debt save people's lives.. That's good numbers got think elections - 'we got pandemic kept county afloat'

Papers - need British summer needs pubs barbers open! 

Companies - we're going bust need open. 

Also, one politician allowed drive 100 miles eye test (suspicious) breaking rule, even pm agreeing him. think annoyed lot people people started get fed lockdown certain people allowed follow rules...

Just thoughts though could wrong American way... America country social media, one top countries poor leadership, miscommunication, overall distrust authority. Pushing blame onto social media like slapping band-aid problem, seems American way late. countries manufacture seem fit. mean...not like there’s much else watch turns competition team stay healthy longest would disaster. lag. look graph new cases see increase going within last 2 weeks. dying starting. affected states bitter weeks ahead.

Here's graph, example: appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* really seen many others make connection recent protests. like protesters going spend 2+ hours outside protesting skip food drink whole time. yeah, actually first person ever ask. accidentally called school recording decided use online username  ideal world solely driven money, I'd agree. still outbreak going world. world think we're going see sports outbreak going on.

No, can't put players complete bubble, though NBA trying, institute rules limit risk, lot testing identify isolate people get quickly, good chance stopping spreading throughout teams. And, least outside football, people involved probably safer going practice playing guidelines limit spread living normal lives own. 

Also, reason NBA try bubble players hit NBA team 15 put games risk. baseball football deal positive tests players quarantined still continuing play. sure. Agree. NBA way. things bad now, trendlines we're looking at, could much much worse 20 days seasons spool up.

It seems like increasingly bad, dangerous idea this, worry it'll also signal public things returning semblance normal, even though sooooo far getting back point, getting farther every day way states opening hit outbreak conditions. open letter World Health Organisation, 239 scientists 32 countries outlined evidence coronavirus airborne.
The scientists plan publish letter scientific journal coming months extracts already leaked New York Times media outlets.
The said coronavirus spread respiratory droplets, expelled infected people sneeze exhale. think 14 day quarantine issue? Whew, Godspeed exam. tunnel vision won’t take comment you. Finally freedom wins. Great.. it’s hard enforce residents allowed self-quarantine home, tourists whatever hotel they’re staying at. I’m talking strict 14 day quarantine specific designated locations. Hawaii would never able get away that. know Florida hotspot right now, reopening new cases rise obviously good idea. However possible probably necessary reopen safely places somewhat handle situation. Schools open since May even lot countries (here France summer vacation started weekend) apart clusters dealt quickly fine majority them. reopening schools increased number new cases. work elementary school went smoothly initial hassle reorganizing everything, even kids seem mind distancing measures much. I've also seen firsthand damage couple months without school small children enough parental support home. 

Listening people assume reopening schools America would trigger apocalypse shown working lot places. Sorry, work cdc link phone. Got now.

So 20±5 means Florida seeing deaths around 9-19th. 19th new cases quarter now. nowhere near seeing deaths significant rise. SEATTLE — Six months pandemic killed half million people, 200 scientists around world challenging official view coronavirus spreads.
The World Health Organization U.S. Centers Disease Control Prevention maintain worry two types transmission: inhaling respiratory droplets infected person immediate vicinity — less common
— touching contaminated surface eyes, nose mouth.
But experts contend guidance ignores growing evidence third pathway also plays significant role contagion.
They say multiple studies demonstrate particles known aerosols — microscopic versions standard respiratory droplets — hang air long periods float dozens feet, making poorly ventilated rooms, buses confined spaces dangerous, even people stay six feet one another.

“We 100% sure this,” said Lidia Morawska, professor atmospheric sciences environmental engineering Queensland University Technology Brisbane, Australia.

She makes case open letter accusing United Nations agency failing issue appropriate warnings risk. total 239 researchers 32 countries signed letter, set published next week scientific journal.
In interviews, experts said aerosol transmission appears way explain several “super-spreading” events, including infection diners restaurant China sat separate tables choir members Washington state took precautions rehearsal.

WHO officials acknowledged virus transmitted aerosols say occurs medical procedures intubation spew large quantities microscopic particles. CDC officials respond multiple requests comment.

Dr. Benedetta Allegranzi, top expert infection prevention control, said responses questions Times Morawska group presented theories based laboratory experiments rather evidence field.

“We value respect opinions contributions debate,” Allegranzi wrote email. weekly teleconferences, large majority group 30 international experts advising “not judged existing evidence sufficiently convincing consider airborne transmission important role COVID-19 spread.”

She added transmission “would resulted many cases even rapid spread virus.”

Since coronavirus first detected China December, understanding spreads evolved considerably, resulting shifting guidelines regarding use masks.

At first, CDC said masks overkill ordinary people conserved health workers. Later, CDC recommended masks people COVID-19 symptoms.

Then April, became clear people without symptoms could also spread virus, CDC suggested masks everybody physical distancing difficult, position eventually adopted.

Now outbreaks proliferate governors order new round closures, nearly U.S. states made face coverings mandatory recommended them, primarily prevent wearers spreading disease.

The proponents aerosol transmission said masks worn correctly would help prevent escape exhaled aerosols well inhalation microscopic particles. said spread could also reduced improving ventilation zapping indoor air ultraviolet light ceiling units.

Jose Jimenez, University Colorado chemist signed letter, said idea aerosol transmission frighten people. “It’s like virus changed,” said. “We think virus transmitted way along, knowing helps protect us.”
He scientists cited several studies supporting idea aerosol transmission serious threat.

As early mid-March, study New England Journal Medicine found virus suspended mist laboratory conditions remained “viable infectious” three hours, researchers said equated much half hour real-world conditions.

It already established people, known “super spreaders,” happen especially good exhaling fine material, producing 1,000 times others.

A recent study found coronavirus RNA hallways near hospital rooms COVID-19 patients. Another raised concerns aerosols laden virus shed floor-cleaning equipment health workers removing personal protective gear.

Researchers China found evidence aerosols containing coronavirus two Wuhan hospitals.

It outbreak among choir members Mount Vernon, Wash. — report incident Times — first piqued interest several aerosol proponents. 61 singers March 10 rehearsal, eight became sick, despite members using hand sanitizer avoiding hugging shaking hands. Two people died.
Skagit Valley Chorale members rehearsed church hall

A team led Shelly Miller, University Colorado professor mechanical engineering, dug church-hall blueprints, furnace specifications, locations choir members hours attendance. researchers diagrammed movements singer identified person unwittingly brought virus practice.

Inhalation aerosols “most likely dominated infection transmission event,” researchers wrote paper undergoing peer review, concluding ill person, symptoms similar common cold, unlikely spent time within six feet many singers touched surfaces common them.

“We believe likely shared air fellowship hall, combined high emissions respiratory aerosol singing, important contributing factors,” paper said.

Eventually researchers broad spectrum disciplines, including several studied role aerosols spread flu, SARS infectious diseases, joined forces campaign greater recognition aerosol transmission.

They said coronavirus less contagious air measles risk transmission goes longer air remains stagnant longer people continue breathe it.

In interviews, said officials unfairly set higher bar showing aerosol spread required acceptance two pathways. “For them, droplets touch obvious they’re proven, airborne outlandish needs high level evidence,” Jimenez said.

Proof would require exposing large numbers healthy people aerosols emitted COVID-19 patients, study scientists said would unethical.

Donald Milton, University Maryland environmental health professor expert aerosols co-wrote letter, said average person breathes 10,000 liters air day.
“You need one infectious dose coronavirus 10,000 liters, hard find prove it’s there, one problems we’ve had,” said. death rate lot factors.
 One important age. Sweden tried tosafe elderly quarantine infected people.

Did same?

Another aspect testing. important much test, also who.

Did example, tests fine hospital suspect, get higher death rate, test severe cases.

If test everyone, rate guess down.

 'I'm Ron Burgundy?' I'd say they'll lucky spread virus, like protesting state lockdowns. think he's trying clear slums. also spreading little testing availability.

When people covid stop showing symptoms tests see STILL covid, tests PCR tests show covid NOW.

If diagnosed covid ever serological tests (the ones say EVER it) know it, wan't know STILL know might contagious.

For example, doctors covid, go back work 2 PCR tests (the ones say still have) negative 2 consecutive days, that's accepted definition ""cured"".

&amp;#x200B;

Again, point test find EVER covid someone admitted hospital ventilators covid positive bad state. need know STILL covid.

And serological tests common, mean hospitals use those. Hospitals want know now, probably serological tests, useless them. ""No credible evidence"" always provisional statement. credible evidence today credible evidence tomorrow. Looks like might first country reach heard immunity ☹️☹️☹️ time start following Bundesliga Thats nuts Airborne... know many weeks earlier? place summer love ?? Oh CHAZ happens insurance companies run money? Well lets hope patients enough beds thats deaths increase. IMO. know, wanted vent. It’s pretty eh. Healthcare, prices lot things.

Public health complicated deal lot factors including human behaviour resource allocation. Never France. whole different world America. can't even keep mass shootings schools. would reasonably think we'd able handle this? percentage hospital beds occupied (the increase 60%-77% referring to) measure much room hospitals have, coronavirus hospitalizations aren’t patients hospital, hospitals need able care cardiac patients, traumatic injury patients, cancer patients, etc... So, rise cases things started reopening, makes sense hospitals would start becoming full. percentage COVID patients shows much burden COVID putting healthcare system terms beds, also shows increase patients need kept entirely separate patients, additional strain putting frontline workers. Hospitalization rate, hand, many active coronavirus cases require hospital care. 2 weeks ago, 100 cases, 8 hospital, 10,000 cases 800 hospital, hospitalization rate would still 8%, set number hospital beds serious limiting factor. also probably worth noting people pushing reopening partying everything, probably lower risk populations, don’t result high percentage positive cases requiring hospitalization. won’t see record-breaking positive cases past couple weeks hospitals another 1-3 weeks, even rate cases requiring hospitalization remains around 8%, going get ugly healthcare system...

I'd also like take time say Trump president last forever. Please forgive lol. :( bring politics topic global health threat ? isn’t sane place like France. People refuse wear masks, social distance, don’t even believe covid-19 exists. effective contact tracing Florida, none across state lines since US government takes responsibility protecting people. testing process failed (Tests take week process Pennsylvania now). Florida anarchy far covid-19 concerned. borders aren’t closed though. NT first case 4 weeks someone flew Darwin Melbourne. face NSW flooded VIC number plates towing caravans. Look, need it, can't control 20-30 year olds. Whatever happened much published trial Invermectin? least two anti-covid vaccines getting much publicity India. Trump Jr's GF likely caught OK, likely spread AZ, diagnosed already arrived staff SD event Friday. 

They're like plague rats... read completely wrong , thought weren’t wearing mask  wait two weeks™ justification. None. Whatever people say. Putting mask hurt anyone.

From outside though, looks like US currently destroying itself. Makes worried future European tbh. learnt recently pick minimum amount exercise stick it. Instead repeatedly putting hour yoga something, new ‘minimum’ 2 x sun salutations. Literally takes 5 mins. feel good carry longer session, I’m still sticking habit always impossible me. Already 2 weeks (and days really minimum 5 mins - maybe 3 4 days I’ve done 30 mins that’s it) I’m seeing increased mobility - can’t yet touch toes I’m getting closer every day! cool centuries people (other nuclear family) around me. people around since March. #SHUT EVERYTHING America mentally sick country. likely scenario February. People knew. No, can't be. heard Texas Congressman Ron Paul saying deaths zero herd immunity virtually already!

One must wrong! That's beautiful. Thank sharing. playing semantics term ""airborne"" since beginning thing. know scient sometimes let technically correct get way what's actually happening ground. Like, can't even imagine upset asked wear mask respiratory pandemic, let alone getting upset someone else wearing one... Like, WTF? Like z opposed told do, would try tell others do? drunk people mingling drunk people households. fuck up, outside no. Outside WAY safer inside sure, would likely protect STAFF, drunk people get close other, yell-talk, slur, masks, make out/hook up, etc. No.

What CA fine temporarily legalize takeout alcohol sales bars restaurants - get fresh made moscow mule enjoy shit home.

It sounds like ton DUI risk (and untangle open container violation created go drink sales still confuses me), really - need drinking home, covid cancelled alcohol-fueled mingles others. alcohol like antidote common sense plus shot undeserved confidence - really, really need now. Yup... Huh? England, UK. isn’t new, somehow lately everyone seem focus droplets/moist part spreading virus changes lot. Business we’re believed safe reopen moderate protections need re-evaluated convince family go dinner? worrying much go anyways?

I live country 1.8 million average 150 infected day. serious lack testing many people tested die they're pretty bad condition, believe number infected people daily 400, 50-60 day city 100 000. Also, half people wear masks less 10% wear properly.

My family justify going dinner restaurant outdoor tables far other. know kitchen staff wear masks probably waiters either. brother says food cooked virus destroyed cooking 'there confirmed cases infected restaurant food'. 

My mom brought 'restaurants close nobody goes eat' argument told wants sacrifice health restaurant close...

I'm losing 4vs1 argument probably go anyways. wanted hear opinion this. worrying much family unreasonable? exactly I’m - I’d love leave can’t easily get work visa anywhere else. case advanced skills (a STEM PhD) it’s still extremely hard get actual job offer. I’ve watching Csada job ads field years luck. last job search applied EU jobs &amp; get shortlisted awesome job Berlin make final cut, none rest panned out. 

I landed job Virginia. It’s... okay. I’m resigned I’ll stay US folks die &amp; I’m retired. 

BTW thinking retiring Central South America, one countries basically buy residency visa shifting savings country. Maybe Costa Rica Panama - one nations good health care &amp; relatively friendly US retirees.

CDC undermined masks politics situation impacted PPE healthcare workers needed prioritize protection. Masks always recommended medically, politically lighter droplets, larger? *Shit, small cities state (&lt;20,000) daily cases entire country CANADA.* 

FTFY Canadians anti mask maybe even anti mask Americans, I've seen Canadian news barely anyone Canafa wears mask unless forced changes react it. example, six feet doesn’t matter inside. still spread. Go hickory tavern. You’ll people there. Depends, happen. Canadian couple came vacation states American insurance still got billed 1mil emergency birth. 

We're busy paying bills travel vote point. gonna say, like ever left violence poverty. family think coronavirus plot George Soros implant people 5G radio wave transmitters make display mark beast. family choosing sacrifice themselves. care dying, bother trying keep away them?  So...a real reason lol told CDC masks didn’t help needed hospitals. scientific literature always pretty clear. brain. Even average life lost 5 years per person

This America.

Re-phrase $150k lost per person government *might* take notice. Larger people offended someone else wearing mask? Mind damn business. Good Lord. 13 new cases usvi thats heard SCMP news said months bus get control California?

Half watching Europe, thought cali rather well first months epidemic might notice f.e. 2000 person drop deaths (apparently woke dead) sudden drop around 60 deaths per day 0 1. happened days announcement we're opening tourism. 

Also, Spain heavily infected Italy whilst Spain started reporting 0 deaths Italy still hovered around 70. Sorry hear that. Wishing speedy recovery. crazy, too. counties states above. tests also 100% sensitivity 100% negative predictive value. test does, unknown true values are. 

This means pick everyone disease, also can't confirm people test negative it.

There certainly people test negative.

Sigh. actually way around here. focuses clinical trials experiment, like particular group scientists using, evidence coming disease surveillance contact tracing 'on ground'. 

This view asymptomatic spread rare. Separate media confusion moment re: asymptomatic presymptomatic. contact tracing data number countries indicated spreading comes symptoms would develop them. known asymptomatic people (those never get symptoms they're mild noticed) *can* spread virus, 'on ground' evidence showing rarely (somewhere 6% 12%). yes, actually follow social distancing, proper guidelines enforce rules laws...imagine right? concept...I get totally foreign Americans, RIGHT thing, yeah Canada

If Americans worst world virus cases! Imagine position worry one person. Meanwhile I'm wearing respirator grocery store US decided million people dead better worrying silly virus. That’s almost like asking hurt get punched face.... Teachers, parents, grandparents, staff, ....

In US poor compliance guidance masks social distancing (AND OR) opening schools seems like stunningly bad idea. 

Add getting sick pretty bad even die, growing signs long-term organ nerve damage even mild even asymptomatic cases. 

We need focus effective mechanisms distance learning (because we're working well) stop thinking schools day care. know people rush bars first chance get problems. ones cause lock downs, flaunt rules, complain loudest, claim affected common sense savings account.

No impulse control, poor judgement, generally foolish. Dark true. US UK population, UK would 220,000 right now. allowed Canada get Alasks LIVE going WORK need provide proof Deaths still boundaries basically. absolute numbers low next impossible make statistics them. One two excessive deaths derail without actually meaning anything.

If new excessive causes found one coal mine, rest country fine without drastic changes, despite precautions beind relaxed basically back normal, Id say connected mine, precautions lack those. Airbone know joke, I'd like point UN sanctions prohibit export Weapons Warfare North Korea, including firearms ammuntion. Links Brazil? They’re separate hemispheres. page happen. problem that’s graph shows. dark orange part graph shows beds taken covid patients. you’re describing happening orange part graph top line parallel other, least top line show jump in. last couple weeks cases spike. people take responsibility sourcing PPE enemy nation? hospital corporations operating cost cutting full ICUs normal times.

That’s bullshit I’m libertarian.

There massive failure ready governmental level. warned decades.

Individually population made worthless morons. government failed two party system every issue becomes hyper partisan. government failed atrocious schools.

The US failed nation people inside responsible make mistake educated populations right thing slow spread uneducated populations mired conspiracy theory partisanship.

That's really it. Leadership fucking sucks here. US high chance reaching 100-day low deaths tomorrow.

Let's hope downchannel deaths continues spike postive cases indicates young people testing. median test age 35 opposed 65 spring. Note actual scientists said aerosol transmission. Aerosol tiny droplets, still wet. It’s journalist/editor used word “airborne”. stricter definitions, “airborne” refers dry particles said. believe proven. However, aerosols still travel fair distance depending force propulsion drafts. would anyone laugh people dying America? Thanks link. understanding decision a) mask, worn correctly helpful, b) risks (improper wear, false sense security, run PPE) outweighed benefits. 

Our health care professionals always wore masks never recommended it. I'm sorry. sounds truly miserable.

The two common reasons lungs might still feel sound like either lung inflammation possible lungs might fluid them.

What doctors said? last time examined you?   employees deserve abuse. know particularly stressful, maybe actually dangerous time, employing kids? fired teenagers working ice cream dangerous job adult stop putting children firing line. 

The firing line serving *ice cream.* reason recognized early created continuums risk instead what, U.S., largely nothing campaign. actually helping noone. 

One biggest drivers United States is, I'm willing bet, fact offices across country never truly closed. many news media politics assumed everyone could working home working home they're not. NYC, offices went straight WFH start lockdown remain way even though allowed reopen. 

Anecdotally, hear hundreds thousands stories Reddit alone people across country nosey middle management type employers called people back office almost immediately long recognized countries like South Korea instance one likely places contract virus.

The difference U.S. countries recovered receive granular information risky, what's risky, what's relatively safe. show photos beaches (relatively safe) discussing reopening hysterical reactionary outbreak family bbq (all outdoors) scratching head outbreak really began Uncle Bob works accounting office windows Huston never allowed WFH. 

I'm convinced 100% problem U.S. American msm begins getting specific dangers stops using nothing firehose approach, we're screwed.

Many European countries came sliding risk scales almost immediately everyone WORE GODDAMN MASKS. staying home time forever, lockdown flatten curve, followed months indoor activities strangers kept minimum, outdoors fine LONG WEAR MASK. Same, probably perfect hell lot better ones US, least Norway. know anything Sweden  n sadistic one joke nevertheless  ... surprise one. beg differ fundamental premise. resources ability intervene governments. Well tell England reopened bars. Lets see get takeoff numbers. pretty good distancing. Lets see happens Dude know...we know. I'd say least half us ""blinded"" patriotic. pissed hate stuff America, need boomers die young people start voting more. Unfortunately going get tougher vote year Trump crooked cronies charge indoor dining, expectation diners wear masks because, well, else could eat?

That said, opening indoor dining huge mistake never happened due inherent flaw. countries count it. Considering number sick vs death rate match rest world, look horrific said done.

If STF sided bozo here, whole country would forced open.  

The problem is, people fall ""govenors"" rules, let alone mayors rules even know mayor saying.  listen president he's head whole thing one supposed generally guiding country direction.  take many people following destroy work various states trying.  disjointed message people creates confusion result seeing. get fifteen people die nursing home covid tests counting bodies mean anything actually counting them. Great day Thunder Bay! fucking moron. Wear mask, idiot. Youre welcome Corona approves message Excellent post forgot everything ‘ZOMG AREZ GONNA DIEZ’ gets downvoted here. America extremely common never pay medical bills, there’s almost repercussions paying prices beyond absurd, could go hospital four hours talk doctor 3 minutes get sent home expected pay 600 dollars easily. That’s hospitals struggling cause nobody ever pays So, 1 % death rate. looking 3.3 million dead Americans year? I've done before. 7 years record or, lucky, company negotiate collection company pay large chunks debt. Someone randomly paid hospital collections year ago. Well almost 130K deaths 6 months compared yearly flu deaths gives comparison. deadly plain simple. China begs differ. know, yelling? Alcohol consumption also negative effect immune system, rest body course. point, bloody hell would finger pointing experts saying anything obvious

Unfortunately, point sadly accepted incredibly selfish foolish people exist case, susceptible harming others. :/ China told us Feb airborne transmission. Ask baker forced bake cake gay couple refuse wear mask Seems like system worked you

A hotel stay costs $500 two weeks.... approval high? We’re leaders incarceration infectious disease. best numbers, beautiful numbers, biggest numbers. one numbers like America’s numbers. work medical field Europe

We're glad retired, yeah. Sometimes mask neck day extra gloves pockets. Done patient. Pull gloves inside-out, one inside other. Use disinfectant door open door elbow. Ya sucks. can’t imagine going one right I’m surprised they’re allowed open. another ""I'm alright jack"" utter pillock. fair people saying Florida 3 months ago took are. 72-year-old dad wanted fly across country see us. said seen reports someone catching airplane. Critical thinking.... doesn’t sound like understand difference transmission death rates. Reducing transmission nothing death rate, percentage already infected end dead. fucking mysterious. spread via droplets air bit different spread via air ""It's bad thought"" ?

What earth smoking?!?

Only weeks work... Try MONTHS brain fog, blood clots, racing heart beat, heart wall damage, liver damage, kidney damage, lung damage (20 30%), headaches coming waves, HEY - that's even PRE-EXISTING conditions!

Oh, Media told this? aftet-effects felt buy TEENAGERS YOUNG ADULTS. SMH fucking America man Well I've heard pray virus away churches fine probs Europeans known building better mousetraps kill with, Americans need look outside borders swear understand, much ypunger population now. give time... stupid title. really good news😕.. false news misinterpretation baby boom first time parents this.... so, large numbers Americans going sick die result July 4 celebrations. Probably 99% of.thr time getting asked make fun berate stay quarantine waiting results? ugly, self entitled americans..:/ don’t understand. tested negative virus didn’t die virus.  saying tested positive one point beat died later? Woah.

Shots fired.

In defense one else try wrangle many Florida man Florida woman. can’t really reason substantial portion population state.

And seen South Dakota?

And look testing I’m doing, many tests. least large cities, kinda forgot small towns. I’m really acting tests, even said “test, test, test,” nothing go tests.

And one likes flip-floppier like Abbott, mean changing viewpoint soooo dumb.

Besides, I’ve expertly side stepped responsibility, that’s pretty smart, learned trick college. Jfc hundreds thousands dead you’re talking someone else’s “senior year” ruined. true absolve young folks blame selfish decisions. mixed back fault nobody forcing young people go parties bars. Olympics $$$ collapsed civilization? We’ve done barely anything control virus that’s we’ll see 200k dead even ramps winter. add flu! 

We half-assed shutdown wasted idiots don’t understand science data. get cross fingers hope hospitals don’t get overrun - terrible death count is, real concern. 

Back spring shocked announced could see 100k dead. we’re watching numbers increase barely reaction. want proof masks work look us USA. majority wear masks leading world pandemic. look countries wear masks many cases have. don’t know would encourage wear mask keep family safe. harm would come taking precaution? Better safe sorry friend. Much obliged. intended wut wut ;) manage? communicate people heading impaired? understandable, fucking much happened last 6 months easy confuse timelines. Things get compressed minds look back. Think little time 1 week seems looking back compared long feel looking forward. hospital corporations sourced PPE enemy state. governments didn’t make illegal require redundancies
and domestic production. Good point, bloody hell would finger pointing experts saying anything obvious sometimes really wish reddit 'laugh react' Pubs outrageous. easing lockdown see essential businesses first, work places crucial, eventually work places cafes 

Pubs restaurants last list, 1-2 months now, rest country open then, using masks. Opening pubs pretty much day lifting restrictions just... Evil. least pertains coronavirus, anyway. medical science sucks pretty badly areas Maybe put Disney World opening hold too? Things aren’t exactly great Florida moment Sonora started limiting border crossing 4th keep 'Muricans Rocky Point.  Naw, one horse got might well let go...don’t want admit closing door first place right thing do.

Back uni either going become professional athletic doctor, thank god picked doctor. doesn’t. please, please educate understanding growth rate. 

Thanks. I'm postal worker, parcel counts way higher Christmas. 

Anyway boss physically threatened March 13th I've sitting home pay since then. never happy hostile workplace enabling stay safe pandemic. mean everything dies contact sun. sure Fahrenheit conversion is, hot AF surface sun! People eating anti-mask video man comparing masks actual slave:  Thank Sorry that. hate people delete comments, thought ""I dont want spend time discussion again"" thought quick enough one would engage. Sorry that! It’s absolutely possible turn spaces hospital temporary ICU-ish areas. absolute emergency, there’s lots spaces could temporarily converted. issue staffing. 

NYC brought nurses over, enormous expense. cases, nurses elsewhere pulling $10k/week. think unlikely Florida that, probably doesn’t budget (given places money needs go, like, say, embezzled). 

Ideally, ICU nurse-patient ratio 1:1. pinch 1:2. Right now, U.K. hospitals it’s 1:4. ICU nursing, 1:4 basically impossible. REALLY don’t want get there, mean substandard care - nurse doesn’t care, they’re asked thing literally cannot done. 

Florida going suffer enormously, done poor job mitigating this. Doubtless Navy bring *Mercy* *Comfort* (the almost certainly go Houston), active duty/reserve/NG medical units set temporary hospitals, even military intervention go far. pictures I’ve seen, social media posts friends friends (folks Florida residents), Florida whole smart holiday weekend. think there’s absolutely possibility within month, zero hospital capacity state, that’s fucking terrifying. Triage situations awful. Lol what? fuck would get can’t get India? talking about? I’m small town eastern Ontario - wear mask indoors know social distancing feasible. also shopped WalMart (I won’t pandemic there’s many people) always, always pull food middle racks triple-check everything. You’d regularly see lunchmeat gray. Employees aren’t paid enough see mask-compliance, humans don’t enough empathy health humans properly handle food. can’t trust don’t find bag shrimp warm shelf simply throw back freezer. Traverse City past weekend beaches packed. Guessing going spike one socially distancing looked like Florida beach. Lol, doesn’t work even free. I’ve seen people refuse mask even someone offering free mask door. kanye 2020! generation pretty dumb deaths attributed causes.

How many times going ignore lessons already learned? No. dumb tourists do. Hey, looks like protest me! know, it’s woke virus, he’ll fine! think contain it, lot people die, eventually survivors move on. 

Maybe able save % get good vaccine considering lack caution think spread dramatically well average person go clinic get reliable vaccine.

Personally, I'm Extremely high risk health issues basically extreme quarantine/survival mode reliably show get antibodies grant fo immunity. analysis betrays total lack understanding growth rate. many people dumb rely that. union?

6.Counts as.....COVID patient? Exactly. 

Critical posts Reddit rarely get far. BJP much effective brigading r/Sino. still working school used work would definitely year ended switching different school district closer home really even know anyone yet definitely want administrators think I'm kind boat rocker. know sick seeing word ""soar"". condoning that, I’m also seeing public health message warning aerosols measures mitigate that. Plz double Canada’s total case count.  would recommend caution interpreting results manner. Wastewater samples different samples sick people. latter almost certainly emerged former - quite widely, given transmissible disease is, many people asymptomatic.

I'd want see comparable wastewater samples multiple places within China make claim virus originate China (which, btw, researchers claiming), even become lethal China first (which possible &amp; suggesting). timelines two different sample times really require wide-ranging places order clarify overall virus timeline.

It still likely (more so, given know virus genome places very, similar viruses found wild) virus became human-infectious China. could easily spread widely strain became lethal. again, present wastewater samples really tell us 'early version' probably widespread first. possible lethal strain emerged China, elsewhere, simple can't determined yet.

Having said that, fascinating chain research, really good investigative thinking part researchers followed trail. Ohhhh nahhhhh!!!!!!! Wat without sports!!!! overfitting illegal teachers strike several states + huge spike phunemona deaths we've since November. shit *just* ""safe"" enough maximum damage. higher kill rate think people would actually taking seriously. know plenty rightfully are, since 15-20% death machine people taking seriously. think flu kills 1% people every year even though really .001% .01% - say kills 1% think nbd. media started ""this hospitalise 20-25% you"" they'd people take seriously. Plus affordable healthcare- plenty people going get tested can't miss work. go hospital. stop working acting normal. believe 99% ""wins"". Whats name? places hot zones now, first wave. help protect others, even little bit, absolutely issues wearing masks public. I'd keep even transmission rate 0. douchebag Americans think president back emboldens them. Mass economic collapse loss kin community *might* something it. 🤔 Completely agree. I’ve always noticed escalators. can’t get escalator us airport without stuck (when trying walk it) someone standing directly middle people standing side side. Go Europe try see happens. No. extroverts Reddit? Damn went cleaning really weird. treated like dripping covid didnt use fancy equipment. hygenist used scraper pick things literally brushed teeth toothbrush. dentist didnt inspect teeth all. pretty pointless 130 thousand dead still going. Definitely serious all. /s knew shit like going happen soon cities let BLM anarchists riot. Fucking country disgrace. Haha. Yeah. ""Marvelously"" better. /s. Texas boned themselves. Cow pee cures COVID19 would think poisonous snakes would huge issue like cotton mouths shit. Fourth July weekend plus Sunday. Death rise point IMO go back March/April levels awhile. Yeah federal government sent one lousy payment even cover month rent. state bungled unemployment insurance badly people claims mid-March still unpaid, never instituted eviction ban rental assistance. ask scenario I'd prefer, choice. say certainty someone spent life poverty I'd rather die go back destitute. real easy say ""just find way"" worry food shelter. privilege showing Yeah all.  Except Sars cov 1 exactly inside 8, months.  

Or coronaviruses cause common cold. One traced back another pandemic. 

Then there's evidence. Singapore found attenuated strains March.  ASU found may UPMC come say clinically changed.  statistics show infections climbing hospitizations staying pretty well flat.  Worldometers 

And nature virus's thrive spreading. can't cause severe illness.

Pretty much place claiming opposite mainstream media.  wary articles say ""scientist"" ""experts"" cite single source.  

What understand April guys top field heed warning.  crackpots quick Google seems reverse transcriptase - polymer chain reaction (RT-PCR). 

This test highly specific 100% specificity cannot guaranteed. no, false positives possibility every scientific experiment. 

No, human method. Possibly, depends several factors, anyone giving straight yes believe without solid reference. ones next pandemic people ready write sacrifice economy due pre-existing conditions... spelled Dumb Fucks* wrong  Fourth July weekend plus Sunday. Death rise point IMO go back March/April levels awhile. Stupid officials CCP one side, idiots governers people one side. really want know people really idiots lives lost important peoples benefits shit. hate wear bit small price pay protect others economy return sooner. really fucked things became controversial US people business oriented. Probably could much earlier smoother reopening masks mandated. noticing well. think distilleries making it. stinks rotten tequila. Makes wanna go buy Patron every time sanitize hands. politically useful. wouldnt pay close attention weekend counts...especially holiday weekend counts. happens leader makes point saying ""Chinese Flu"" everytime talks 

Then hillbillies hate monger One ready elections. Totally safe trustworthy... know he's political not, seems government listens suggests lot pence would listen fauci Actually one cases actual racism unlike classify racism nowadays basicaly everything. high expect deaths rise Florida? expect fold increase match increase cases? Again, going get doctors nurses? takes years train new ones, there’s limited number willing go hotspots, matter pay is. That’s reality you.

Once hospitals overwhelmed death rate everyone skyrockets, reality. Yes it’s pandemic bad things happened going continue happen, planning letting hospitals get overwhelmed want bars stay open got one worst ways handle this.

Maybe consider think bars critical keep open hospitals aren’t. want happy hour friends, video chat. can’t function without bars, maybe it’s time ask problem alcohol. Remember ""Liberate Michigan"". Yea, do. Remember Whitmer did? Fucking ignored it. AZ do, liberated.

AZ averaging 50 deaths day, reasonable estimates say start double number next two weeks, more.

Voting matters. Oh jeez. get test you’re remotely concerned. They’re cheap broadly available every major city. 

I 100.0 fever one night plus dry cough another couple days back March never bothered get checked out. drank beers entire time seemed impossible could coronavirus. Took antibody test last month curiosity came positive. Whoops. 

Take careful precautions try rational too. far less likely someone infected attending outdoor protest, especially lot people wearing masks, say going bar, grocery store indoor rally held racist. 

I see lot reports protesters throwing temper tantrums wear mask like people... It’s young people. people ages ignoring warnings various reasons. Hard fix ignorance. 100%. husband worked office everyday 2 weeks ago informed would working home indefinitely. whut?  Repeated rhetoric certain person/party inflaming morons commit crimes minority group? Say ain't so! slap wrist... I'm sure need convince Bloods. Crips already board? +184 deaths tens tens thousands cases last two weeks, heck could low? Even factoring unaccounted cases young folks *still* seems really low? Nobody saying protests absolutely risk free, dumb false equivalence compare indoor bars restaurants Why, seem really shook made leave? I'm sure people scared asked wear mask leave. also clearly live one counties police actually going enforce it, publicly declaring won't. Cops hang report someone Denton. Definitely so. 

Pretending Switzerland Third World country total headline disheartening take future predictions anyone's making without big grain salt. take day day see things go. give someone somewhere gave long timeline feel like give eventually. Keep good fight, really idea changes even near future bring. Yeah, I'm exactly sure what's point (or even validity) news article nearly everyone developed world vaccine. ICU, doo doo doo Thanks. """"..after staff cheered posed picture, went right back work knowing still people ICU needed care attention."""" Makes wonder second wave, date keeps getting earlier first around Yup. We'd keep disposable PPE week. week! disheartening, lent evidence fact even highest authorities N.A. staying informed keeping valuable published evidence collected medical scientific community pertaining invaluable first hand information transmission virus.

This spiraling realization throughout months February March. March gut-wrenching, stress listening national local leaders talk illness showed doorsteps unannounced. knew lot virus then! really did! act complete unknown?  Fuck, wish Canadian. \*Internally screams Walmart\* Technically reverse Karen, since telling people call manager. hospital Indianapolis handful covid beds now, half hospital beds spring. ACA far free. 

Last time applied it, made little ACA, much Medicaid, rate would like $700 month. 

My BF little while. Close $200 month $7500 deductible covered almost nothing. 🥴 

I mean tried, failed. Let's stop talking guys taking photo reported right, seem posted before. I've re-instated. Toronto major city world feel ya there. Know lots like you. :) far, dig post history people clearly partisan agenda...

I know people convinced pandemic political issue. early March like April so. Since least early may directive been, go doctor hospital needed, Covid units separate. least Ma.
I’d 0 reservations going hospital now, went pcp early June. It’s fine safe. Maybe FL TX AZ. like... 3 days ago something. Absolutely. I'm trying edgy. I'm trying get anybody. even total number biggest problem, fact cases happening once.....don't know hospitals keep would crazy idiots megaphone now, that's difference. wear swim goggles don’t care laughs me. I’ve people imply I’m crazy enough evidence eye transmission possible. think overestimate many Americans IQ 50. don’t problem states virus control reopening. I’m also going continue laboring delusion political authorities political capital impose another round lockdowns. man. finally started going in, needed surgery shoulder... like clockwork bam pandemic. Covid deaths massively underreported globally. I'd bet every cent that. Nah. costs went get fined. still helpful others... That’s BS. know people gotten going hospital chemo treatments, exposed working grocery store. careful wear masks, stay distant, shop essentials, essential worker (well, government thinks anyway), go hospital week surgery. potential risks exposure.

have go hospital Germany here, instructions unclear invaded poland instead politics means rich people prevent us protecting want money. want politics work going end immeasurable power money human safety. Gotta love leaving california. ;-) Doesnt ski goggles. Shop lag goggles work. helmet eye coverage like welders mask paintball mask xenophobes disappointed... Illinois really solid. Poor TIL headcrabs Half Life real thing.  realize this...thought prosperous skewed elderly. Gotta educate !! Yup. Given positive test rate something like 15% more, there’s fuckton people spreading this. Arizona hit nearly 40% positive tests one day, Florida could see well next weeks. Seeing thought across board... MANY TIMES need see sky rocketing cases results LOTS deaths, right away... stupid? time ""absolutely necessary"", late lot illnesses. NJ done good job bringing numbers down. also passed 3 month extension budget billion dollars case crap hits fan again. smart. don’t agree forcing kids back school September. early make call. You’re welcome move China it’s much better. Nothing stopping you.  Switzerland third world? drugs on? active cases difference staggering. Canada 27 000 current cases, Florida 170 000...... must nice national plan. Good you, Toronto. rejoice success. Yes, are. never way I’m sick idiocy, divisiveness “leaders” brought us death rate still low... getting texts Uber drivers pick wearing masks. research real data, also factor protestors also go eat meaning overlap,l. lot metrics factoring full context. data analyst, sometimes unrelated data sets overlap intersections cannot isolate one without other. “essential” action puts around people raises risk period. stuff magic hard foresee predict. thing requires self responsibility. Anyone self quarantine mask part extension Covid true patriot. Human life always take precedence, matter color creed. need save ourselves!! I'm adult caused great deal both. ran one keeps repeating citing Florida's deaths per million surge New York's surge claiming means Florida fine. 

it floats one ear that's stupid way use statistics. try run it. I’ve heard get prices ridiculous, like $10 one Ya saying need making lots money, able make couple hundred dollars signing autographs occasionally ridiculous. Seems like sort thing rich parents keep kids track poor families poor communities everyone work choice let kids fall even farther behind. It’s people sociopaths. average person understand math percentages. happens get car wreck need one ICU beds? Sure let ship ya state ambul.... oh wait none to. 

Hope young good chance recovery, means probably need ICU begin with. Add people spreading killing people attend to, ‘Own Linz.’ Went yesterday target first time since pandemic began majority people wearing masks. Maybe quarter shoppers weren’t wearing them. Normally used person wearing mask. right thing. see what's happening country many others. matter time everything shuts again. Keep family safe continuing make difficult, adult decisions.

Home school failure.

Teachers don’t right top kids. Get one Boston Dynamics bots fuck kids line. Florida seems going full throttle matter what. Nope – protect much ever did, virus change.

The smaller particle, less mask filter.

Bandana &lt; surgical mask &lt; n95 respirator &lt; n100 respirator.

If droplet transmission, surgical mask worn patient would provide 100, worn others ~ 70-80 % risk reduction. airborn transmission, severely reduced. N95 filter 95 % airborme particles. (N_95_).

So no, masks protect even more, protect less. that's way important. mask wear protects health, masks fellow citicens wear. Virology microbiology classes mandatory hs curriculums moving forward. :) highly doubt people LA sun deprived. understand correctly, vitamin deficiency common symptom many chronic illnesses. diabetic obese probably larger risk low vitamin D. 1,000 cases single day huge, lets hope trend continues.

Any time get bunch people enclosed area walls bare minimum air quality dictated building code you’re probably gonna spread airborne viruses, wouldn’t think? 😅 

I’m sanitation expert, mind you. I’d say every little bit helps. Always control *you* control. includes wearing masks, sanitizing high contact objects, etc. Wouldn’t hurt ask management consider ways clean air. Remember skeptics would make fun saying “two weeks”?

People don’t get Exponential growth heartbreaking mere numbers person life, friends family. point, think need make point, stop engaging people altogether, let find hard way. Otherwise, it’s like getting fistfight tar pit.

Hopefully, choices won’t affect people care. nose hanging out.. went Japan back 90's 15 go visit friend move back dad worked Bridgestone. stayed 3 weeks shinjuku district friend went around Tokyo. Things little different then; example, saw grand total 2 non-japanese people entire time there. Back then, they'd graciously allow commit faux-pas laugh dumb foreigner later. 

Some odd things witnessed: old lady(like 90) carrying grocery bag crossing street car hit her, KNOCKED GROUND groceries went everywhere. guy gets car apologizing (I assume) gets up, dusts off, refuses help gathers groceries keeps walking like nothing happened. 

Another time walking street PACKED people old guy middle riding bicycle. young (maybe 15 knows) kid pops crowd right behind punches back, took crowd. old guy calmly gets bicycle, sets side walks kid.

The ill ran across friend went go visit grandparents stayed overnight. Walking around neighborhood, friend passed guy said something thought sounded shitty passed asked friend said, friend told said ""What hell THAT?"" referring friend walking together I'm white. told older Japanese still harbored resentment WWII. districts Iowa already announced going require masks fall. teaching unions discussing changing policy state require masks.

I also art teacher Iowa, understand fears fall. biggest concern shared supplies. Children ages put markers pencils mouths put back sharing bins. Masks much shared supplies need disinfected use. Students need provide supplies teachers likely going alter lessons best fit minimal materials students purchase.

In end, matters feel comfortable idea student teaching pandemic. sister’s SIL 4 kids (4-15 right now) found she’s like recently pregnant twins. can’t imagine take care 4 kids right everything could avoid pregnancy. Like fuck. variety cold strains definitely part it, drives research costs way up. consider demand there. one enjoys getting pricked, something innocuous (heh) cold suspect lot folks would take chances. Especially insurance cover it, might since colds lead things would cost insurance money later. help list EVERY death COVID19 eariler research shows quite numerous articles. still matter though. masks effective preventing infected person spreading virus, preventing others catching it. El Presidente walks around without mask, telling everyone meets margaritas, likely infect someone comes contact with, regardless steps taking. Droplets aerosols, big leave mouth evaporate settle environment. get small enough cannot effectively filtered cloth mask. however first leave large easily captured even crappy cloth mask. 

the aerosol science community clear definition aerosols think medical world disservice world trying reclassify entire organization already defined aerosols. Anyone refuses bare fucking minimum wearing mask allowed treatment. course never happen. based maybe bother you? Best case helps reduce transmission, worst case nothing. Either way it’s wearing piece cloth face public, it’s big ask. 

And doesn’t take 1 viral particle make sick, masks still stop someone sneezing coughing face dosing viral load big enough cause infection. 

Sure, *over time* you’re closed area person might get viral load breathing air close proximity, time shopping aren’t going situation like continue understand lagging indicator lol still good 60-70 years ago rhose improvements. think need study this, even Mexican government said outright. Move. Nothing requires stay shithole states like Iowa. outdoors significantly reduce spread UV shown kill virus. That's huge factor spread linger hours inside, quickly dies outside greatly impacts chances getting it. Mask wearing social distancing two additional factors impact spread. Going beach, simply virtue outdoors, advantages protests people wearing masks social distancing relatively safe activity. Again? post ridiculous. Start calling out, call OSHA Occupational Safety Hazard Administration instead Safety Health. can’t even get right .... woke evil Dr Fauci's plan make wear masks able get Oreo Blizzard want to

Too woke fall though preliminary data houston there's slim noticeable amount deaths young healthy people. 100 skittles dilemma: gave bag 100 skittles told one poison one, would take some?  obviously miss whole point exercise. 🤣 India: tried really hard contain pandemic, yet simply resource so. 

United States: resources contain pandemic, yet simply so. Yes. protest going away. stop black people treated equally. downvotes Reddit won’t change fact. STOP. listeners Rogan podcast fans. attracts niche community meathead alpha bros. Personally, can't watch always crosses legs wiggles foot around 2 hours annoys crap me. kind splashes aerosol clouds might enough infect persons easily. different indoors, keeps packing aerosol cloud space people breathing speaking. packing effect happen outdoors, air circulates much, much quickly.

I still saying outdoor areas completely risk-free. still good mindful. seems trade off.

In US easier get stupidly rich.

But expense poor. Death rates appear down, data suggest hospitalization percentages also decreasing? deaths? No, get infected massive viral load.

I get it, desire see suffer maybe wise bit it, right need like watching GoPro camera feed nurse working COVID ward Houston one full shift. like Black Mirror episode they're allowed close eyes look away, watch whole thing. idea people it. I've working home went back office week ago. week filled racing mind, attention issues, exhaustion, crying fits. try distract home interest attention. feel empty backed corner also know lucky still. heartbreaking can't help worry futures everyone know, don't, think recent months. 

I wish could tune really keep situation changing daily. Trying mentally prepare another year. 

And like BRO, want fucking hug. make shit ton money. Teachers suffer every single day overcrowded schools, don’t threaten quit shame public. might gotten tests mixed manner got them, still got blood test done first, swab. day work helping get tests administered. wasn’t confident blood test, info stated, got swab one hospitals. it’s pretty clear covid. Ehhhh. Typical hyperbolic title whoring? can't plan parenthood, that's crazy talk. Ny numbers, % population 65+

NY: 16.9%
FL: 20.9%

Florida second highest % population 65+ US. point testing nothing really government isn’t forcing mandatory quarantine people / tracking calling everyday contact tracing .. get iv lots vitamins suck garlic point I've moved survival mode. thats situation I'm put in, cloth mask comes respirator goes on. stop spread covid? Depends. I'm infected doesn't, I'f I'm I'm situation clear protocols force, fucking matter better smart responsible person get sick, dumb ass thinks masks responsible spreading covid. ok long need go ER kind emergency. Corona show back home anyway Boomer here. always angry people get tail knot something. always anti-gov't muh freedom types. seen blowback debit cards ATM's. Holy shit world going end debit cards.

What's different polarization tribalism. let everyone know side includes unleashing innocent. Greed. drop shit state US? 49 states I’m cool it. Maybe pick Guam state shit keep round number New Yorker, astounding. take pleasure numbers. 

Wake up! Wow, y'all really learn anything watching cases explode US, huh? EU better put plastic dome UK push sea think accurate america realises needs wealthy live, rinsed worth leaves die. get ICU went bar instead really depends subject matter. subjects (like business English, basically anything that’s 95% reading, writing discussion) lend selves particularly well digital learning— reason commute classroom sit cheap desk listen someone yammer hours comfort home proper desk chair. physical sciences? Yeah, that’s tough without lab work. LOL. Nice comeback Also yeah... fml. irony killing people virus protesting murders another group people. Leaders wanted admit transmission protests, scientists coming forward damning evidence here's part everyone start dying everything unrelated covid story like start Jan March. 

It inexcusable point certain you-know-whos resign. protests going grow people lose jobs family members covid. Except numbers, much would like believe it, NOT!

Also remember years flu deaths undercounted hospitals nursing homes loathe admit someone die flu.

They keep putting 'natural' death pneumonia without even mentioning flu all.

One doctor JHH Baltimore 40+ years subject told 2009 estimated year world actually 1 million flu related deaths.

Are anywhere near CoVid? No... nowhere close. think strain Beijing came Europe. might right new strain infectious. Well least expert said infectious strain would observed more. mom process first samples blood AIDs epidemic country, despide job. People know sacrifice untill put lives line. reopen protests one wearing masks? That's funny. guess hit nerve made someone upset. 
 

You can't address points go name calling. can't take little debating comment anything. 

Now take L kindly fuck off. Italians Germans — big European mask wearers — already stopped wearing except half-arsed use public transit. Good luck Americans think people wear another six months primary public health intervention. months demand extraordinary compliance public health interventions citizens you’re gonna get it. Sorry upsets people, wish wasn’t case, “just gonna live virus” really new U.S. health policy. 

For country “lives with” wild gun violence 87 million uninsured underinsured people, Americans used message? God 'except as' lot work sentence.

I got taught anything say word 'but' matter. can’t figure keep risky stuff especially people kids. Sad vaccines hot political topic US- way hell anti-vaxxers get inoculated thus furthering spread. daughter quite lessons outdoors last weeks. Damn beach packed. always hated going busy. smell sunscreen people watching fat people Ohio now, county-by county basis. Bubonic Plague curable antibiotics, significant finding. catch prairie dogs US. Lmao exactly. Thank god brought expert tell us shit spreads club Fuck you. cuomo reporting much lower 1,000 day Houston, problem. really need police abuse food service retail workers better. people need go prison. bad day. abuse someone allowed fight back. Absolutely disgusting behavior! Maybe get lawn Or, could try REST developed world did, know, take seriously. isn’t cases severity cases people color. beyond protests inconvenient. exponential growth continues, protests could putting people actively danger. people protesting, also families, friends, etc.

If point you’ll stop say “these protests causing damage issues protested” sound awful lot like single issue activist. strong opposition seat-belt law--and many people, recall., drivers conform within year two did. likely among traffic fatalities. true mask defiance. downvotes? never said wear masks I'm saying N95 masks suffocating regular cloth fabric much better me. Don’t rely vaccine. 

One may never come. 

Or major damage done. Yea lemme know actually shut down. Change word “kids” “everyone”  still haven’t figured scroll, you? 3 people thread. 2 know you’re idiot. Probably 3, tbh. Keep struggling, junior. Yeah, that's contact tracing for, far working pretty well. already one bar cluster months ago cleaned pretty quickly. Although, said personally bar since January. don’t get people MSM focused deaths?.... Many doctors, scientists people virus said people going experience serious, life long complications virus. Surviving enough. 49 percent Chicago too. don’t think ever actually needed. protests?

The anti mask BLM? Clearwater makes lists top beaches every year. mandated fines issued citizens stores issue. Shirts, shoes masks. sure people hard time understanding that. I'm sorry start feel like regarding US fact buying medication vaccins.  FHM, Socialstyresen. one month. two weeks either. Three weeks apparently ;)   


No Comment excess death fits Covid-19 deaths? Thank honesty. sub could use people like you. Put relaxing music try [this dont feel better little while, I'd call doctor you. live Miami we’re pretty good job part FL going lot available property Arizona Florida 6 months. gets massive 55+ retirement communities it’s going death factory. lol Add exponential growth really matter look log function both. Bad Americans.

Thanks info. Depends exactly Ohio, kinda mixed. Unfortunately area, many people act like this. figured something immediately tried googling find another source couldn’t find anyone else saying them, guess should’ve looked articles pick one Something something constitutional rights not, live think thats case? new strain came US? I’ve heard easily spread less deadly. May signs things come-everyone eventually get it, deadly. Time tell. Close fucking gyms asshole Garcetti. Don’t worry guys, president hard work planning bunch new statues course I’m responsible it, everything help child. Schools good kids. Staying home not. agree. conceptual level understand. BTW... parents teachers, thank &amp; applaud work.

Regardless, developmental learning vs someone chooses acknowledge refuse learn maturity expanding social issue itself. draw line anymore? Social responsibility fall definition point. Looks like I'm downvoted high horse PC brigade speciesist. havent laughed at.  It’s absolute fact hospitals Cali near capacity. Downvote want truth truth. 1) it’s flipping contagious hospital systems get overwhelmed people would fine won’t be, 2) people coming along symptoms complications weeks months later long term issues aren’t quite understood. may part 99% would survive, survive lifelong issues?

Still going make like two really? that's rampant?? god. dealing deadly disease, infective dangerous, definition. fatality rate, 4.5%
much lower population fatality rate. 
to date. I'm PE teacher summer school started oh boy. Lucky ton space I'm standing stage they're seated floor able take mask talk microphone give directions. However, start rotating gym floor amongst I'm keeping mask entire time. Weaboo /S misleading see fan club downvotes lol prefer calling Standard American Diet....SAD I’m surprised, weeks ago spike one wearing mask even trying social distance. getting looks wearing mine... Ehhh... Sure references masks website? can’t find them. places seeing recommended site, would like see it, can’t big focus would recommending booklets posters slow spread, instead burying elsewhere site. 

In case, 5 percent danish population wearing mask compared 63 percent US, still great. country live in?

On booklet, basically longer written booklet poster posted details, see masks paste full don’t want think taking context:

3.5. Barrierer
I situationer hvor ansigt-til-ansigt kontakt indenfor 1 meter ikke kan undgås, kan man op- sætte en fysisk barriere mellem personale og kunde/klient/patient. Hvor muligt kan dette være en skærm af plastic eller glas, fx ved en betalingsdisk eller hvor der skal gives tæt vejledning eller behandling som f.eks. instruktion brug af hjælpemidler, neglebehandling m.v.
Hvor det ikke er muligt, fx ved kosmetisk behandling ansigtet, eller når frisøren klipper pandehår, kan personalet evt. anvende et ansigtsdækkende visir. Dette kan især overve- jes ved ansigt-til-ansigt kontakt af 15 minutters varighed, som f.eks. ved udførelse af ansigtsbehandlinger, eller hvor opgavevaretagelsen indebærer korterevarende ansigt-til- ansigt kontakt med mange forskellige personer på en arbejdsdag, som f.eks. ved blod- prøvetagningsambulatorium.
I situationer hvor ansigtsdækkende visir ikke er muligt, som f.eks. spaltelampeundersø- gelse hos optiker eller øjenlæge, kan der anvendes ansigtsmaske (type II).
Der skal være særligt fokus på brug af barrierer ved ansigt-til-ansigt kontakt med perso- ner, der har betydelig øget risiko alvorligt forløb af COVID-19, som afgrænset af Sundhedsstyrelsen anbefalinger af 4. maj 2020.
I dele af sundheds- og ældresektoren, f.eks. på plejecentre eller sygehusafdelinger med immunsvækkede patienter kan der være øget smittetryk, øget modtagelighed og stor sår- barhed beboere/patienter. Der skal bæres ansigtsvisir eller maske, når personalets op- gaver indebærer langvarige eller hyppige, tætte og uundgåelige ansigt-til-ansigt kontakter mellem personale og borgere/patienter, som f.eks. når en social- og sundhedshjælper assisterer en ældre borger med mundhygiejne eller hårpleje,
Visirer og evt. masker skal ikke bruges som erstatning tiltag som afstand, hosteeti- kette og håndhygiejne, men kan tjene som et supplement tilfælde hvor anbefalinger om afstand ikke kan overholdes. Personer med luftvejssymptomer skal ikke søge tæt kontakt med brug af visir eller maske med mindre det er aftalt ved kontakt med sundhedsvæse- net mhp. udredning og behandling.
Det er vigtigt visirer/masker bruges korrekt. De bør ikke berøres brug, da man så fald kan føre smitte til ansigtet, og de skal skiftes når de bliver snavsede. Generelt kan samme visir anvendes en hel arbejdsdag, og nogle typer visir kan vaskes og genbruges. Masker skal kasseres efter brug, og de skal skiftes, når de bliver våde, snavsede eller berøres, da de mister deres beskyttende effekt.
Det kan ikke anbefales bruge hjemmelavede masker af basically, advise used dealing close contact high-risk people, like nurses nursing homes. stress need used correctly specifically recommend use homemade masks. Plus really push shields instead masks situations used day, washed re-used, masks, need thrown use, changed get wet, dirty, otherwise won’t protective. idea either time get test... work university city’s current outbreak due college age kids gathering weather nice. illegal text drive Arizona. what's point? Again, know mostly non-symptomatic, ""not properly reported"", mostly political issue. Dead teachers continue keep going work?? simple: little something prove things right way lose well. already top get complacent lazy. think one interesting lines research right Covid. another cell study recently sub showed something like 40% uninfected individuals level cell response (not positive exact numbers quite high). large percent population level protection virus would really significant finding. lol people wondering hubei authorities got panicked welding people inside homes february jobs “essential”, people plentiful. 

The really large corps would rather close store entirely fake plumbing issues allow union take hold. know. I’ve never now, second ever shroom trip, afterwards chest hurting right sternum joints left side, like, huh, weird. barely found that’s exactly Costochondritis is. Don’t know caused it. 🤷‍♂️ in, prevention efforts first used Wuhan (and later refined smaller outbreaks Jilin, Shulan, Harbin etc) worked Beijing fine able stamp G614 strain outbreak. thisisfine.jpg Thanks rec. added To-read list. Can't answer. Also greed whom? literally attempted berate using ad hominem attacks, exact thing. mad obvious colleges going open fall require distance learning? get scammed? going scientists voice disagreements? hardly ever perfect consensus stuff like this.

Its question trust - believe best can. also know happen pressure ship. talking tradeoffs margins binary choice something work. Binary choices easy. many people willing stall process dot i's cross t's people dying every day especially 100% certain right answer? Go Toronto! Y’all deserve Yes really. They’ll blame someone else. Anti-lockdown people CA blame Newsom problem also refuse follow mandates. yeah got symptoms im gonna go charged $160 told go home wait till gets worse anyways. Imagine virus infectious enough infect ten people total course = dangerous you. 
Imagine virus extremely infectious = much dangerous you. intended scientific work, don’t expect level accuracy, contains well known constraints:
- lack demographic analysis country 
- lack trust intervals

Regardless, roast away. Wut best economy long run... worried son symptoms? initial government/business talk virus, plus government business pressure reopen lockdowns main culprits situation bad.

Also must taken historical note:: initial flattening curve, trust civilians abide safety precautions all, in-fact expect opposite--So prepared heavily enforce. Didn’t Spain put two areas country back lockdown? Gates knew HCQ study show doesn’t work. does, used right doses. shown highly effective using resulted avoidable deaths USA.

No work. stop spreading lies, bullshit, conspiracy one many cases disingenuous involvement, altruistic purposes but... must...sell...vaccine.

Let's assume work. stop selling vaccines? Plus logic reality dictate cheaper prevent disease treat it. know logic something encounter much parents basement try pretend familiar concept going insist posting Thanks brain lol. pretty easy figure simple math, know everyone comments can't put 1+1 together. They're 40s, like 20s. Still enough rejection impeach him, 40s lot people fence apparently. What's source that? We're talking long-term sequelae here, acute symptoms COVID-19 itself. amuricans narcissist? psycho nation. Life’s beach die African Americans dying much higher rate Georgia 30% African American. would true average people saving money putting stock market, i'm worried much food cost next month investing it. i'm worried run bank putting account. i'm worried whether still job next month, going trip, etc what’s age vents?
This deadly 65, deadly 50. It’s reality man. Well Florida, feel still say everyone Texas really F-ing stupid. Florida stupider. Frat houses often rent rooms students varieties summer, including non-members women. students living housing shared amenities. great closing school won’t achieve anything—the school already closed. home right now. Uh oh... better tell stay way FOREVER two three months quarantine back normal

I know how. live, people abandoned social distancing young people enjoying time going daily, meeting friends etc. two months now.

It's miracle lie cases deaths low now. Mind you, old encouraged die home instead going hospital fighting life. maybe deaths written non-COVID related keep stats looking good. government's first announcement TV would pursue ""herd immunity"". government also believe masks work. tried make fineable offense wear mask actually filters. Pretty expensive, keto though cheap Coronavirus likes this... Go tell people busting asses work forget ones raising hell crowded street. Yeah Murphy easily earned reelection vote handling this.

Why many reports people ventilators ECMO weeks time? Hospitalized months time? believe plain wrong. No.. infectious + death rate = infectious... Make illegal sell groceries someone wearing mask. Clerk simply says checkout they're legally allowed ring up. ""very important thing countries learn from"" apparently launched commission look handling least. Kinda killing faint praise. Also feels bit dishonest paper imply directly related handling without going behind paywall... Anybody tips talk older family member teaching unnecessarily next year? Step dad 79 got call come back teach adjunct college starting August. need money wants he's bored pretty much debts usually tied prison system cases child support. don’t go jail consumer debt, especially medical debt. Well Beijing wasn’t original outbreak. Oh learned today? Don’t know pump really generation generation raised? 8 days considered massive sacrifice suffering? Sounds like spoiled child. hey--what matter? virus kills old people sick people, wants f#ck them? Amirite? fuck federal minimum wage $7.25???????????????????

I know im UK stuff different wow.  I’d say that’s left weed insanely stupid ignorant people won’t listen matter what, isn’t works stupid ignorant people going infect everyone else. 

So NEED government step in, except government stupid, though ignorant. care $$$.  u seen Chernobyl like scene people bridge watching explosion knowing they're absorbing deathly amounts radiation. One hope This. Like rioters looters aren't? illegal contract covid supermarket. trying compare two things comparable justify asshole sick people. Yep. guess it’s based delta. Theres new community transmission cases anywhere else. fly-in quarantine cases 99.5% new cases wife's ICU surge space full 100% vents. Deaths coming young people infect old weak.

The idea virus ravaged world 3 months suddenly ok spread NBD one fucking dumbest things ever said. Fulton county. understanding make masks mandatory they'd provide ridiculous. predict students *would* wear masks stay home work online kids refuse masks show person. forget building wall boarder mexico, need build one florida data beautiful work university well reopening plan hopeless optimism. city also middle outbreak (still small, growing—enough discussions shutting again) city reports tracebacks shown it’s primarily young people gathering social situations wearing masks following guidelines. mostly college kids working summer coming back early...it’s going nightmare students come back.

Also new class interns (about 5-6 people) least two weeks one went date townie first week supposed self-quarantining, got COVID, got tested exposing everyone else orientation exposing bunch staff members. understanding calculate total two weeks get better representation batch covid cases started ended. 3-5 day incubation still need wait full 2 weeks see full picture. Must power hungry freem stealing Satan-lady work people article 20s 30s. read comment Facebook yesterday said 1.75 dead better 50 million unemployed. blew mind. two weeks predict Florida going major hospital issues.

This pandemic become predictable average layperson expertise medicine epidemiology knows exactly we're headed. Short answer seems since viruses really circulating mass 6 months, They're still whole lot learn does.

These touch younger crowd.[Huston Methodist Hospital Young Covid April looking young patients. 

[WOPO Young Covid Patient's &amp; That's definitely unfortunate, seen crowds full people wearing properly couple weeks ago. Wonder changed since, saw realistic crowds. Exactly! Sounds awesome :) Post-covid complications severe covid symptoms hope idiots would realize putting sickness raffle isnt way go drop go something else feel way. Sounds like really isn’t right fit anyway. I’m sure plenty opportunities local McDonalds Burger King you. Alberta anyone wants test get one, symptoms not. That’s case while. Testing fairly easily available, know two people last week felt may exposed (no symptoms) got tested within couple days - Canada Day even - results within three days.

I won’t test though unless feel symptoms know risk exposure. involve weiners? feel like one luckier long haulers I’m breathing issues still occasional extreme fatigue. super strict eat seems helping. Sugar alcohol definitely limits. Think timeline new cases:

1. People engage social behaviors chance contracting virus.

2. people may begin develop initial symptoms.

3. people measure check symptoms via, example, thermometer.

3. check online resources see symptoms may COVID-19.

4. check online resources home care availability testing.

5. may confirm get tested healthcare provider

6. schedule test, go get tested await results.

7. positive test processed

8. positive test added public stats showing new case.


So, consider long might take total exposure seeing positive test reflected official figures. weeks, typically.

Instead, model could likely predict new cases based increased social behaviors likely spread virus it’s even contracted, web searches symptoms, testing, care, smart-thermometer data report fevers measurements fevers cloud, scheduling calls appointments doctors symptoms testing, doctors searching resources info provide patients.

This isn’t good way predict individual test positive, it’s excellent way predict many positive cases might expect.

Sewage checks might slower, harder validate, difficult guess infected material added wastewater, maybe much variable based stage persons infection, etc.

Also, works areas public sewage, many areas local septic systems.

If waste water data helpful, yes, might factor sophisticated model like one described yet another input/signal improve predictive accuracy. anyone virus twice? symptoms April feeling symptoms August, time travel long NY Ca (fuck american airlines, flight packed!) :/ common? TIL US, economy profits important people’s lives. looks like douche, swims like douche, talks like douche... hope Dentistry creates aerosols hang air. 
I'd find office least attempting appear like they're taking seriously. 
Don't put issue long though, lead expensive procedures tooth loss major infection. people thread think I'M asking effective? course know not, made r/Masks4All I'm highlighting even article point.

Obviously there's crucial care canceled impacted. So...keep stringent shutdown &amp; fucking sends kids school, then! may counting manipulation data. Sometimes feel like people days want attentions, matter how. heard Toronto ZERO. incredible difference btw US Canada god fingers crossed  I'm MA, CA, I'm close one main roads hospital. late March mid May, traffic otherwise dead thing heard ambulance sirens rapidly increasing intervals. 

I'm saying, someone faking this, went all-out detail one locals would ever notice. want go Occam's Razor, maybe virus real people actually sick. Can't wait tweet...

""Great news everyone. Spread word. thinking Corona dangerous, discover worrying nothing whole time! beautiful thing..! crazy mix up..! Jokes guess...LOL"" way shortage alone imply caused inventory issue. mention, distributors carry 5 months inventory anyway even without JIT. argument makes zero sense. Well conflicting data.

The trial stopped back mid-June due retracted paper used fabricated dataset unreliable startup company (with 2 employees LinkedIn).

We new study came showed significant decrease death treated HCQ. prospective study matched patients based upon propensity scores large reputable healthcare system conflicting conclusions like this, studies required. specifically, need double blind studies stopped mid-way due flawed prospective studies get proper peer-review. would choose assume trying hurtful? sidenote apologise boo hoo comment dumb Relevant topic. go r/COVIDpositive reddit people stories like this. valid, cannot say - I'd wager least are. also article Atlantic worth - Well deaths lag behind cases we're record high new cases death rate caught up, going bad. hospitals overloaded death rate start going back again. initial death rates high Detroit, Chicago, NYC facing huge surges unable care patients. see young people moving Villages! I'm volunteering first round rushed-through-development vaccine. people guinea pigs side effects. proved safe effective I'll gladly take it. hope remember restaurants literally killing people this. go manage stay open next wave.

We even opened inside, people somewhat packing close outside here. sent notes used favorite restaurants letting know lot people going going ever kept see goes. understand completely wanting stay business. understand things know we're going kill people staff. doctor Houston praising something called MATH+ protocol. explains detail short description is:

*""The name MATH+ acronym medications. Methylprednisolone, Ascorbic Acid, Thiamine, low molecular weight Heparin, PLUS additional options, zinc, vitamin treatments provide may determine...""*

There things like keeping patients prone (on stomach) Remdesivir.

With infection rates though, still headed disaster spread reaches at-risk people. scenario US deaths stay flat virus spreads exponentially society. New York seeing 800-900 new cases 60,000-70,000 tests daily.

Around end March seeing *8,000-9,000* new cases 10,000-20,000 tests daily.

Some models project reality New York seeing ~100,000 new infections per day back then.

Millions New Yorkers already infected, herd immunity, spread going drastically slowed there. know, right? continue shit. every state there's cases daily though stay open. shut down. Find way. federal state governments forcing shit get worse elementary schools reopening even alarming. College kids may irresponsible, little ones germ factories. send stepson back daycare next week, I’m terrified him. Can’t get wash hands wear mask properly anything. holds water, #CHINALIEDPEOPLEDIED officially lost momentum - begin with.

CIA sweating bullets right I’m curious makes cases reported today. 24 hour time frame whatever happened processed yesterday today including 15 days ago? Ok. stats Canadiens taking pandemic seriously, respecting social distancing, genuine respect others crowding bars, restaurants etc. 

Masks big can’t social distance, I’d love see stats they’re findable end. I've dispute over.


People understand yes small, small portion population got far, whole point spreads exponentially.

To steal recent comment saw..

If lake, introduce water lilies double every day lake fully covered day 50. day lake half covered? home, ambulance can't get time opposite, I'm doctor wears PPE go anywhere work.  We're probably even done first wave NJ, fam. goes show natural variation deaths. ‘Expected deaths’ isn’t always accurate. Especially zoom smaller time frames specific geographies. thinking same, however consistent reporting deaths holidays Easter Memorial Day would like think accurate. Wrong riots curfews, protests initially caused people STAY HOME lowering R0 protesting. mean virus spread among protesters. Contact tracers NY ALLOWED ASK. know distancing alone work indoors several case studies: studies Table 3 several cases 0% close contacts got infected wearing mask. data show indoor environments 19 times dangerous outdoors, speaking/singing situations much dangerous situations people silent, prolonged exposure increase risk directly, large percentage infection occur pre-symptomatically. Good luck hope stays safe answer everyone sign waiver don’t care Nothing world free. Let’s say another country produces us, purchase them, considering product higher demand other, everyone else also competing purchase it. Even somehow “free” (meaning people compensated tireless work) would still limited supply, 7 billion units anything become magically available free charge?

And “mandatory” lol ok, punishment someone refuses? Take back shoot them? Covid concentration camps? I’d love know dystopian nightmare you’d choose. 

I get idealist view easily SAY usual, nothing simple. parents really believe serious can't understand it! They're evangelical Christians think affects ability believe science. (Ugh) I'm Utah. depends time day I'm out. Early morning, 90% masks. 8:00 a.m., 10-20% masks. death rates low, many large families. family four considered small side. kids skew population age down. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going say spread factor. Hong Kong twice population, much dense, generally older population, too. disease longer. Last time looked 1300 cases 11 deaths. Ukraine free healthcare. Maybe enough people get terrified we' wearing masks longer need terrified.. weiiird.. ....what? sort stroke? know people keep saying better person learning Hello, wrong. 
Not Denmark’s borders opened travelers UK, quarantine 2 weeks upon arrival. Cool expected turn, one. Yep! story American higher education.

As ""cheap temp adjunct"", one schools teach going full remote semester, not. one opening fall swears control, know soon student staff member diagnosed, school close ASAP! say that, remember: ""Jet fuel melt steel beams!!!!1!!!"". staying home making risky decisions life long consequences parents care work day bored. Sure have. Since stay-at-home orders began lifted April 30 death spike May 6 consistent decrease deaths. 66 days since lockdowns lifting, that's counting states never stay-at-home orders. takes 14-21 days kill people, think 66 days would enough time manifest. Yet manifested. all. people still insist keeping fear alive reason. People need leader us good self preservation instincts also like lead. yeah people behave stupid lead properly. seems possible. hope student realize us professors getting jerked around (and aren’t making decisions)! Excuses, excuses. Either unquestionably willing blindly subject rushed vaccine government propaganda purposes, one so-called 'paranoid idiots' yourself. it? come soon, mon ami. right. 99%, actually 99.6%. hospitals STILL PPE staff shortage

Staff genuinely tough problem fix, I'm absolutely mortified American sorted PPE situation. DPA utilized? factories time spin now? fuck happened?

It *not* help see every cop every piddly little town apparently equipment &amp; budget wage full war, local nurses still re-using N95s twenty times. Current CDC data states:

 

Historical data states:

 

Go look yourself, suggest starting pneumonia influenza deaths first 6 months year comparing previous years. Ill give clue....they much higher. Trump anti-mask always money grab. Dorms look like prison cells. amount money spending better 5 star hotel yet put hole wall, crammed stranger. Oh man. selfish, stupid idiots US capable shame. Violence, yes, shame. didn’t say *which* April! offense need grow fortitude first part crisis. need people like suck buckle down. slightly inconvenienced 3 months- dont get complain lost 120,000 lives track lose 250,000 parents spouses. 

It's time toughen up- going get much worse need accept wearing masks months. Get now. going cost another trillion expenses dealing long-term health consequences. Yes. Western society, we're taught *any* government intervention whatsoever - regardless serves everyone's well-being - authoritarian, limits human rights freedom, inherently dystopian.

China's response COVID-19 demonstrates prioritise lives.

America's response demonstrates prioritize rich. # One small impact - Texas, Florida &amp; Arizona good counting covid deaths - good New York, New Jersey &amp; Connecticut anyway. peak shifted south, counting got kind funny Well done Toronto! Hopefully celebrate Montreal also one left ICU couple weeks’ time. mask prevent getting slobber stuff ^ guy pinball wizard. Ain’t truth. Unfortunately, live Trump country California. wife immunocompromised teacher terrified go back school. It’s pretty obvious administration taking seriously, all. policy far teachers wear masks. kids, sounds like it’s optional. survey sent teachers “input” results pretty horrific. really close 50/50 split teachers concerned concerned weren’t. administration past done surveys like let teachers fee like actually input. always end going anyway, even things unanimous. Shit fucked. I've seen mental health teens deteriorate. developmentally abnormal isolated life experience ground them. think month long time year eternity age. chance brain-eating amoeba sitting swab? right, New York infected much country... 3 months ago. July Florida infection spreading from. Times change. reopened person summer school small Catholic school kids who, Zoom disaster. Small classes, everyone wore masks diligent social distancing. 
Then two weeks kid tested asymptomatic positive exposure home it. Closed, back Zoom rest summer school. 

School reopening huge level August either going two outcomes: close school every positive student reopen weeks later all, say, fuck it, sick kids stay home rest play Russian Roulette.

The answer schools come Covid Waiver. give thoughts prayers Agree totally 3 points.

Plus 4: takes three four weeks case becomes death gets reported. Thanks! dont kill anybody either! :) Fukin Disgrace... dentist everyone wait car parking lot come go directly exam room. hygienists masks face shields. Probably best operate really, still risky. hope never find excruciatingly devastating virus friend. Please stay safe. rate may need be.

&amp;#x200B;

MURICA! Mask wearing actually prevalent US Canada. 22 percent pockets assholes assholes every scenario ever. Nobody excusing that.

Broadcasting everyone flouting rules nothing encourage others idiots like them. Wrong. countries invite random people ""go get test,"" although course pay one private lab. Testing reserved symptomatic (i.e. risk bad outcome spreading disease) confirmed exposed virus contact tracing. 

It's insane actual sick people America wait hours tests, Karen flew plane two weeks ago feels fine believes entitled test. reported 32 new deaths one day less week ago. Hope not, could holiday reporting delays.  going bother girlfriends son mom treating like hot zone Ebola patient? trying dick really. couldnt pay one children. know old hope terrify him. Guess what, European superior mentality runs too. Hence propagandas counties. fair things still happen, seem taking place almost entirely outside transmission risk lessened. definitely extent it’s happening south border. yeah guess AZ badly. ...or common cold? People get corona virus measures deserve. yo make sound like nature agenda. Nature impartial suffering life. knew already. never real intention secure country protect virus. always half assed hand waving shut people up. Yeah I’d love details indoor outdoor airborne spread. Social distancing friend pool kept sane. Excel. numbers inverted: http://owo.whats-th.is/9ZLAb1c.png pile certainly becoming bigly week. America bad upvotes left least call fucking police him? That's assault weapon. http://owo.whats-th.is/9ZLAb1c.png One things worry could case point. imagine like doctor nurse dealing seeing many ppl blow make even tiniest effort help. Sooner later guess many think worth risk, empathy chipped away. Look numbers worldwide. Deaths people 50-60 like 0.2-0.5%. Like 90-95% deaths people 70+

In world “everyone dead” situation? Playing devils advocate, one could even make argument letting Covid run rampant better economy since vast majority deaths people workforce likely receiving contribute. 

Covid huge threat economy. Pinellas beaches resident here, people vacation care anything themselves. truly sad. Every city cancelled fireworks stop party whatsoever. understand many people dead set ""Let's go Florida!"" First world refers countries sided US Cold War, US literally definitive first world country immense amount positive change comes wake this.

For starters, idea every employee physically sitting office 9-5 become archaic overnight. Remote work far widespread undeniably positive vast majority office workers. don’t surprised cause damaged blamed pandemic deaths. started traveling Afrin!! usually spray take help open things up. would easier everybody they’d chosen quick death without taking anybody them. heard every Sunday two months yet deaths done nothing gone every single week. anyone telling kids climate change?... that's still 40K students campus, classrooms. University moving forward similar plan, I'm livid. Rotating class schedules might foreclose one potential infection opportunity, undergrads campus ""spread out"" willful ignorance think of. definitely aren’t school haven’t taken distance learning. fucking sucks. It’s impossible learn since teachers don’t know doing, 101 distractions getting work done really hard, obviously can’t socialize friends. get it’s something students need do, would never able work long term. masks work! Oh wait work make can't breath!! Freedumb!

My thoughts Tampa residents limited freedom pursue healthcare could necessary survival. Wuhan military game perfect condition superspreading event Fair enough, basically answering different question.

In one case, we're talking clothing accessory cultural/religious pressure wear it.

In another case, we're talking health accessory fact wearing one kill human beings. So, comparable laws forbid driving drunk.

I'm going assume I'm one sees difference :) This. understanding right enforce type requirement based sanitation heath, much like masks. discrimination much ""victims"" would like be. Heath code thing, even wasnt people dont like optics shirtless dude lobby, sanitary. point still private business set requirements, long discriminatory race, religion, gender. example, restaurant texas, legally open cary fire arms permit. Business however still legal right allow someone open carrying place businesses choose because, well argued health risk. Lol couple years? already exist saying fake.

I live Tampa glad GF work home limit contact. bad feeling pass 60k/day week. said man ""deserved"" horrific death drowned bodily fluids period weeks supposed protective custody state responsible ensuring cruel unusual things befall him. said man deserve die he's able appeals, appeals may show actually innocent crime like many him.

That relish unjustified undignified death human makes better him. appeal emotion statement fact. careful making false equivalence.

While diseases may share similar base symptoms (fevers pneumonia etc), totally different viruses, behave different, harm individuals differently different origins.

Hence, getting one either one make immune other. better takeaway patient either incredibly lucky survive 1918 flu (H1N1 Influenza virus) typically deadly youth young adults COVID19 (Coronavirus) typically deadly older adults elderly. Even 100% identical, would mean COVID-19 virus circulating wild long time already infected humans least before. point lab-escaped pathogen. Where's empathy? Like said, people literally read comments every single thread subreddit see anti-trump screeds everywhere. continuing assert aren’t silly. specific coronavirus worst them. It’s basically /politics Covid justify existence. boulevard talking about? beach Florida ever. Except Miami ton stuff right beach, usually private homes. young people probably get it. Listen what? clubs open blame going ? Cool. They're still dead obesity still problem, least know *you're* better random stranger. That’s reason something unhealthy. 

Why masks unhealthy? Germany actual first world nation though. Yeah do. 3 months without touching another human room someone age, desperate type connection. I'm rushing bars anytime soon they're open fall I'll probably go beer friend Tuesday Wednesday night. How's people within 40-60 ones dying yet +100yo somehow always surviving lol, stories make sense Shit like depresses me. 

I one day ICU three days disallowed INSURANCE company said need ""that level care"".

Here crazy part. whole day disallowed. ICU costs. going cover anything day. room, meds, Dr's, nothing. definitely spreads fleas human human transmission also prominent, that's mostly spread 2017 Madagascar epidemic there's question positivity rate hits 12% Gov. Newsom going mandate lockdown order LA County. County board spineless, even flat told public lockdowns. act, Governor definitely preserve hospital system. stage everyone knows lockdown quickly prevent NYC levels sickness &amp; death clogging ER's ICU's. either read letter, purposefully dishonest content.

Going post history, latter, stated times simply want wear mask.

Looking rest posts, seem like miserable, selfish cunt. We'll lucky virus takes likes you. get fair amount Canadians Europeans time year top people coming parts FL country general. use Lysol wipes implications true? Article doesn’t explain really Remember like, 1/3 world’s population infected Spanish Flu time. sure downvoted truth, especially major universities

Not sure D3 schools, even stated “most time” ... subreddit worse fucking covid lmao American tragedy perpetrated fellow Americans. killing people. covered feds. guess go hospital may kind provider fee admittance fee, you’ll need details figure pay. Temporary Change....?

Did even try fathom hundreds millions people countries dying access food job shortages ? environmental damages natural animals ? 

And domino effect stated ? affecting everything else , society, family, TV.. Lazy-ass bullshit title writing. Latin America 650 million people 20 countries across 2 continents (arguably including sections US, Miami). Big sections Latin America violent poor. They've pretty consistently changing report data look like problems. Check wayback machine see changed time. instances I'm sure HIPAA thing, cant tell us work x number employees work covid related things. Cannot tell us self quarantine positive. it’s UNNECESSARY people driving around hospitals trying prove virus it’s fake now? hope go clinical nursing school. graduate 6 weeks clinical entire semester. :( knew would happen. ""If someone given us warning!""

- mayor, probably.

/s neighbors actually amazing fireworks. sat safe alone front yard watching fireworks explode right house. walked twenty steps inside ice cream. Best 4th July I’ve awhile. "" ""One woman group described blood, taking blood, like chocolate pudding -- thick,"" Bishof says.""

LMAO. sounds like people belong r/COVID19positive sneaky libs allowed protests spread red areas, kept protests cities safe! strategy? That’s news me. closing specific businesses ? Bars, nightclubs, etc ? still haven’t told actual reasons masks unhealthy, since don’t block fresh air. 

They block droplets particulates. 

Which plenty people *even walking alone* wear polluted areas block allergens. site lists sources right-most column 3M variety commonly sold west fires valve I'm amazed people can't keep date young people getting hospitalized virus, EVEN COULD KILL PEOPLE. Seriously, cannot understand people value personal convenience peoples lives. There's learning curve, ensure work done, got easier first month. Daughter A's. son got 3.5 gpa (all time best) reached HR restaurant chain work this. Businesses plans place bare minimum comply guidelines, it’s required, don’t plans deal positive employees. leaving managers businesses desperate revenue step right thing engaging independent contact tracing encouraging testing additional precautionary measures among staff. 

I’m optimistic anything change regard clear enforced instructions safely dealing positive employees workplace outbreaks. I’m shocked business work plan knowledge deal positive employee first case came up. I’ve seen first hand management willing lie something urgently needs addressed. also realize die mean long-term physical damage result. Yep, their's shitty argument. check latest case/death curves Tampa call spike! It’s weird all, *anxiety* disorder definition hyperarousal benign trigger. bet you’ll alright though 🙂 executed tortured. died illness...the thousands others.

I feel bad him. Bruh got married month ago 💀 implemented COVID-19 required precautions. could done would said 'no hugging’,”

There's contradiction there. think would rather die pay 795k that's rediculous  fucking county go back school would stupidest thing could do. Florida’s cases right insane school supposed start weeks. hope don’t. USA (California) here. I've quarantining responsibly possible nearly 4 months now. go outside couple times week, get groceries/necessities much-needed fresh air. always wear mask social distance responsibly. extremely fortunate job amenable working home, realize everyone else similar situation.

It pissed yesterday, going social media seeing many people responsible. People simply care, given altogether. could done virus 2-3 weeks stayed fuck home rode out. 4 months later, we're way worse months ago. I'm exhausted point.

Sorry ranting, great day everyone. Paywall schools provided partial refunds students remainder semester moved online Yes 100% work restaurant NC. Stay fuck away restaurants don’t want corona, I’m serious. UV nasty stuff. gives us skin cancer. kills disinfects lot microbio Maybe Orlando Health improve things well, certain business town, universal, mayor standing middle street calling anyone without mask days ago. Yes - Since 1973, 169 death row exonerations. grew Tampa, I’ve always familiar beach, couldn’t find list busiest beaches except one linked #20. say isn’t busy beach means, looks dwarfed many beaches Florida, let alone beaches throughout whole country. grew Madeira Beach, Seminole Indian Rocks. spent lot time Bellair Largo well.

Clearwater popular, Daytona terms travel. People travel Orlando go Daytona Cocoa beach fix.

Better drag Covid19 questioning this. freedom Starbucks order double frap. dare listen liberal lies! Also don’t forget extra pump vanilla! It’s mass casualty incidents routinely fill emergency departments; clearly experience issue continue argument based nothing. please go ahead, sorry interrupt factual information. least they’re keeping news, people don’t seem remember. Thankfully old people young people never come contact It’s awful. thought racial differences. you’re right, it’s sinister. It’s evil. entitled opinion. no, not. Save democracy know now, deal pulling country back center later smarter you, can't tell /s next step proving confers protective immunity (your body recognizes destroys SARS-CoV-2 virus trying infect based 'seen' vaccine.) words neutralizing antibodies necessarily mean protrcted.

LMAO! Maybe do, ut rest world got figured out. STUPID Well, he’s far truth first one. first half, gonna lie. Universal Basic Income via wealth tax offset can't work must stay home simultaneously stimulating economy. Medicare combat virus encourage people stay home sick.

It's good solution. Even people pretend ""no good solution"" want pay would rather let people die. So, answer no, evidence *this* virus' spread affected seasons. would get teachers classes though? high school teachers working full time teaching students. sure. feel like posturing we've defeated virus. Murphy seems dialed back little bit recently appreciate. Finally I’ve waiting expert chime real researched based answers - prisons protect besides letting go? man danger society involving killing maiming others can’t release done protect situations like this? Also long worked field delivering prison health care? Thanks replying! Playing optimistic devil's advocate maybe want deal backlash/protests shutting America day Texas....be interesting see changes course monday stating article paper submitted Nature said.  need argue scientists created hypothesis. suggest trying make biological weapon. know 🙄 
it’s crazy. lot animal medicine thing humans (diluted different concentration differently used something completely different). 

I remember first experience dog never spayed giveb tramadol I’m like “wait - tramadol? use dogs it’s 5.00 mom pays 30??”

The vet like, “yeah stuff!” 


This whole invermctin thing going ridiculous everyone catches starts buying up. get nervous live Florida many mosquitos, worms, mites creatures animals need either feed store vet. 

Good thing bought different dewormer favorite part use “dangerous freedom peaceful slavery” without realizing Thomas Jefferson slave owner...

Hypocritical bullshit. debunked 2020....of course shit going hit fan, it? get many downvotes people know this. video saw several medical people saying ventilator harm good. Lol. really believe people willing stand line hours take test case asymptomatic feel completely fine zero symptoms.... yet even put mask??


Bahaha good one. Oh. terrible dream. there. there... lol, like “Good news, tenured faculty died permanently replace rotating set cheap temp adjuncts!” really spell assesses? looks crazy. bad getting worse. par NY yet we're woods yet. detection SARS-CoV-2 March 2019 really questionable science. There’s evidence virus either month, scientists “used entire sample” one test, there’s possibility replication genetic sequencing. also shows two PCR targets, could spurious reaction contamination.

The virus showing November December around world interesting, also consistent current understanding kicked Fall near Wuhan maybe people traveled time. Oy. shit show. Every single seat sold even though website claimed ""encourage social distancing"" lol. open windows. family behind us wear masks talking loudly whole trip. bus driver coughing fit entire way also wear mask. travel partner livid got argurment people. Boston, abandoned trip took Amtrak rest way way better. Practically one car wearing masks. Lesson learned. Yeah, IDK thought Presidents Men HCQ... probably horse Anti-umpers CDC, NIAID, HHS ... riding. ut...but... sign slave, defying Dear Leader /s

The idiots wear mask, they'll wear dumbass made-in-china red ball cap. Prove it. Show bodies non-geriatric, non-immunocompromised thin people dying COVID-19. make short like ""do right time"" readers loose interest half way reading convoluted line. run dehumidifier 24/7 still get mold. may get another one. actually interesting story I'm sure downvoted. Bret Weinstein Yuri Deigin interesting conversation sample.

The TLDR: RaTG13 published 2020 similar strain Covid19 outbreak. reported sample collected 2013. weird thing RaTG13 basically holy grail lab would looking (a SARs like virus infected humans - exactly lab attempting study). However, passed something discovered 2013 found particularly interesting time - defies logic also prove anything beyond odd behavior. Interesting same.

Here full interview. begin discussing story around 12 minutes - Would great actually companys start producing n95s mean months seems like gotten supply now. chinas pumping like 50 million day. true. lived california 4-5 years now, born raised still follow news. seems like every year fires get worse. i'm hoping shit doesnt hit fan season. know things won’t settle unless there’s leadership top mandating restaurants closed... won’t happen otherwise... think important remember wealth literally means security.

You're secure much lower income US. backlog sentences starting “Donald Trump claims...” staggering. guy hotel said downtown area town “a carnival”.

Turns catering impatient entitled people country :| kids. Kids die. rate, surprised many kids die staff many kids Truly worst timeline. 111 year olds v comfortable though stopped covid testing would problem /s America Fuck Yeah  Good decision sounds amazing It’s time. Maybe UK stop following advice man bragged shaking hands coronavirus patients mask on, get hospitalized contracting coronavirus? someone lives one states, took us weeks serious cases start that. Florida seems right schedule paying attention happened northeast. NY dropped 100 deaths day 43 days ago. long major part USA death counts. continued part excuse ""I going debate you. really. But""

Gold. think FDA going fight administration rush vaccine. Honestly, could never go low carb diet carbs passion (especially mac cheese!) know diet cut entirely would make miserable ultimately unsustainable. Research tends show smaller lifestyle changes ultimately lead better chances KEEPING weight restrictive diet. like intermittent fasting easier lifestyle change cutting foods completely diet. I'm happy keep carbs diet long better currently suck at, portion control total calories. One friends going law school said big problem Bar accepting online law schools. Idk that's changed last couple months scheduled open 6 days, almost seems late stop reopen? Employees back town, families already vacation plans, way they’d stop governor made them, that’s happening.

Drunk Needed Rightnow order literally work hospital article there's definitely increase caseload, majority covid patients need here. vast majority also low maintenance/low acuity.

It's really crazy working here. kinda slow actually, there's lot room put people. cycle pretty quickly Yeah, know got DP’d. unironically. Deaths rise. cases younger healthier people, won’t get Italy NYC numbers, deaths come, well complications get ill don’t die. extremely concerted media strategy early pandemic focused driving home point young people also risk severe illness largely fallen wayside seem saying huge worry young people. Which, sheer death count, true worried dying. 

But that's thing worry about, worry catching begin even people mild cases getting long, drawn post-viral syndromes. lot ""first"" wave. also prevented elective surgeries (which expensive hospitals) free space. ya thing started seeming better couple months back excess supply planning taken stopped. last sentence key Exactly, many elderly working school. Need advice. parents live near Tampa. snowbirds, stayed extra long get doctor appointments missed shutdown. hail Midwest. tell leave immediately hunker down? 90 year old grandpa also lives declining health. dad immunocompromised. 

Thoughts? live nearby could make food deliveries, mom doesn’t stay home. concerns returning Midwest influx relatives visit, nearest city large hospital pretty far away. Im fan Trump's handling pandemic herd immunity stategy theorey herd immunity get least 60 per cent immunity general population period, protect vulnerable 1 per cent keeping home. doesnt mean accept kill 1 per cent population.
No country successfully come close carrying herd immunity cant effectively shield 1 per cent vulnerable people (or actually 0.5 per cent studies showing). countries tried however never part strategy kill 1 per cent population. folks don’t know: Medical Center largest hospital complex FUCKING WORLD. Except, spent month talking ""plateau"" number cases, evaporated instant started testing people symptoms rather testing people needed hospitalised.

Even middle ""plateau"" obvious counting number cases simply based crude fatality rate - Sweden averaging 13% world general averaging 5%.

That showed Sweden counting something like two thirds true number cases.  passenger: roll window. Yes, hot outside. roll window. actually think origins virus discussed decades come sort unsolved mystery thing. entire TV episodes dedicated it. ""Entirely different"" really best way describe it; Pinellas Hillsborough considered MSA (Tampa St Petersburg Clearwater). us think different parts more-or-less city. Internal medicine resident here: fundamentally true. read article morning...and im sure understand enough viruses...

but gist article 3 chinese miners died mysterious disease 2012, 2016 chinese scientists captured precursor covid19 cave Yunnan province...

ive seen also speculated covid 19 circulating since 1980, needed come contact human jump species.

i hard time believing virus spreading november 2019. Lol right? Like really think people wear mask, they'll stand line hours get test? True, hiding case numbers make death rate appears higher actual death rate is. India around billion people correct. Florida live around 20 million less 11,000 cases yesterday. Crazy. Corona virus - defunding police one officer time Yet there's significant discrepancy US numbers comparable places incentives exist.

There literally zero evidence happening, baseless speculation. happening small scale overall statistically insignificant. mean government gave guidelines help pretend safe. Seemed like followed guidelines worthless. 

They still services though? Every pew? That's pretty stupid ask me. took 10 hours manually approved posting? Test shortage means contact tracing forked scientists Oxford probably starting rehearse Nobel Prize speech. hospitals start exceeding capacity it'll like 5%. mention number people suffer consequences due damaged lungs lifetime. Morphine cocktails fun man put prison he’s voted November. Sorry, people expected stay home long. Europe two three months quarantine back normal. Unfortunately, Americans fake “lockdowns” — unenforced free travel wherever want country — still lot new cases. asking Americans stay home another three months? stayed home three months, I’m community even traveled see friends birthday party two weeks ago. It’s fault Hasidic funerals, basement parties, incessant travel NYC LA led “lockdowns” working. Every man woman — tried show social solidarity fellow Americans selfishly not. Im fan Trump's handling pandemic herd immunity stategy theorey herd immunity get least 60 per cent immunity general population period, protect vulnerable 1 per cent keeping home. doesnt mean accept kill 1 per cent population.
No country successfully come close carrying herd immunity cant effectively shield 1 per cent vulnerable people (or actually 0.5 per cent studies showing). countries tried however never part strategy kill 1 per cent population. Finally going down. Let’s phase 3. feel much better going July reopening Disneyworld Well, Chinese tourists even enter Canada right now...  rules! bad can't follow them.

I went pub yesterday. supported local business. beers sunshine. atmosphere great, social distancing observed, issues. reality 90% pubs. No, business trade allowed People told everyone agrees.... every two people wear mask, fifty people wearing mask. like TN. used midwife paid $3500, hospital complications thankfully. couple outside appointments ultrasound couple hundred more. live schools require masks worn students school employees? schools area going require masks worn students. many people feel though kids pass virus others. fair, yes cloth mask allow fog mirror. try thing cloth mask versus none. notice fog slower. stand little away repeat mask one. notice time taken fog mask longer. 

You're right, may offer protection long run, protection better none I'd say. We're together.

The public services keep country functioning well much depend tax revenue. Business  Testing completely covered either private insurance federal government. Many local health departments also fund community testing. kinda surprising people hard time understanding concept. get infected die immediately.

Of course, death numbers going lower new remedies, level seeing now. .. wow, brag controlling virus 572 sq km island.

It's harder trying thing 35 million people 10 million sq kms. Looking testing regime Germany, no, absolutely possibility. tested everybody, self quarantine, go team hotel controlled access players staff. fined coach went CVS buy tooth paste, find players took masks brought barber hotel crying loud. handled rigor either unwilling unable muster... “It’s like virus changed,”

so airborne transmission enabled start? pandemic reading 1918 pandemic, led searching academic papers influenza transmission. figured since viral respiratory diseases, like influenza (SARS, MERS. etc), causing recurrent problems, lots research transmission would done. papers found much information, several mentioned lack data area. find that, together warnings epidemiologists/virologists pandemic highly likely, extremely disappointing. I'm also stunned wealthy countries, like US, huge public health agencies, defer WHO, apparently, caught flat footed wrt test kits, ICU gear PPE stockpiles.

China, 3-4x population, outbreak center, &lt;100k cases we're around 2.5m. WTF America! I'd love lay team Trump, seems almost universal incompetence. 100 years billions dollars later we're still debating masks. Gonna long hot summer Makes sense.

Masks definitively work effective means protecting others SARS-COV-2. airborne well droplets masks protect even previously thought right? cool black mask covering generic 3ply mask usually wear. difference time case case requires large inventory meet theoretical demand. case would’ve made lot better sympathies. state run idiots. harshness doesn’t get applied countries. “wield anti semitism” (interesting choice words). atrocities peaceful cousins inflict conveniently left narrative. It’s easy sit privileged chair stakes game would hung toes part society defend. There’s reasoning people like fuck Oh 35 million? Try 350 million 9.8 sq kms. 

Btw thought Canadians supposed nice? picking guy dont think hes bragging? Older kids maskless seated class wear masks moving around recess. Apparently that's safe enough they'll seated 1.5 meters apart class.

This backwards...

Indoor, cycled air, little movement people - masks.

Outdoors, fresh air, wind, plenty movement - masks.

Uh, OK. friend’s dad died breathing problems. also tested negative. wonder false negative rate higher think. I'm familiar Europe v. USA.
Trump denying definitely help. I'm sure period spread significantly people realize difference common cold flu. JFC, Americans, destroying country keeping busy enough? try go way destroy countries too? \*sigh\* 

Is really hard kind caring toward actions?  Airborne spectrum yes thing. 

Just one many problems way media communicates news us. 

Scientific sources say evidence news says airborne.

The problem word Airborne trigger word many people. think CDC dragging feet it. end result made problem worse now. Username checks Wish teacher fucked “non science background opinion” thought coherent, useful scenario.

I major reservations school system handle something scale - there’s way many human variability shitstorm inevitable. suddenly need excuse? thought reddit loved whole body choice thing? Sure, absolutely. Half parachute works great too. FreeDUMB Please posts links use link shorteners/re-routers obscure true destination link.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* stats article match CDC reports every year.

The article claims 1 10 people die every 100,000 infected flu.

But CDC estimates 43,000 people died flu last season, 47,000,000 infections. 90 deaths per 100,000 infections, 1 10.

If 1 10 people per 100,000 flu infections died, 43,000 deaths last flu season, means entire population U.S. would flu.

This still much less fatality rate coronavirus. writer article can't get basic flu stats correct, probably whatever else said also untrustworthy.  get outrage masks. ""No shirt, shoes, service"" seems universally accepted. another hygiene thing (and one potentially fatal consequences). see wearing mask like that, assume you’re mouth breather. need name database? Facebook info. Short term yes, long term increased lack quality education harm children virus. woooooosh :) Thanks explaining it. 

Things seem simple easy fix people outside, like every industry, explained complicated. people wear masks. helps fucking people wear masks. helps fucking people wear masks. helps fucking much Maybe need go puberty first? Yes... Plague Inc virus levels Teachers UK already back. Lol That’s shown, it’s assumed. Illegal immigrants Texas treated free insurance. Tell retire. Seriously... point choice living dying, would rather live. did. linger within 4 metre radius 3 hours surfing 120 foot wave, less. find plenty articles sides issue. Note study cited, China, studying 75,000 cases virus, concluding airborne.

The subtext Wired article cited is: 'The word “airborne” means different things different scientists, confusion needs addressed.'

There PNAS study attempted show statistical analysis supporting mask wearing, many [calls weighs Texas also incredible spike Pneumonia Deaths unrelated COVID. unrelated. 28% excess death rate throughout US Well, US (and Brazil) provide scientific evidence would happened pretty much everywhere else hard measures taken, economy virus. People countries seem managed keep coronavirus sort control. It’s human nature problem here. discussing get help. people geel unaffected, that's why. groups friends, I'm one knows died, died it, it. exactly real people - removed. CDC need dismantled rebuilt scratch. Neither organization showed kind leadership initiative needed most. point discussion. Getting COVID means theses things HIGH probability happening:

You could die.

You could give someone else, could die.

You could get sick lifelong health issues.

You could give someone else could get sick end lifetime health issues.

You could health issues, spend rest life wondering exactly desease actually you.

Text tricky way. counting deaths. Rates going 3 weeks death rates haven’t budged. Either doctors brilliant ways treat covid counting deaths anything else can. look overweight ? BC district work teacher cited research New Zealand kids rarely get infected carry virus, rationale reduce anxiety opening up. big fan, anymore. Checking Donald Rumsfeld Deaths lag cases couple/few weeks so. takes time die, people drop dead moment test comes back positive.

And yeah course thing excess deaths compared last year. it’s 120 proof higher 😂 theory, capacity increases due less lethal mutation perfectly valid.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

Im sorry ☹️ honestly think they'll go ahead whoever willing able play point. Esp. MLS, getting financial windfall TV deal. They're desperate. IHME joke. literally hard coded second wave starting September 1 every state. It’s ridiculous. horrible continue horrible forecasting.

Use covid19-projections com People: Billionaires need give money away! needs much money?
Bill Gates: Here, donating fortune help battle pandemic.
People: evil trying depopulate world! don’t need money! 2.5 party system. smaller parties still representation parliament (as opposed America), never win 1st 2nd.

Except 2011 NDP Official Opposition lol Install fireman pole outside window slide always known safe, opening make money, safe. safe atleast year, even vaccine rushed distribution.  Airbone wife Orange county. think we're like 2nd hottest state right now, details returning. want go in. We've stayed home since March keep getting contact older relatives vulnerable this. pretty much condemning families sickness likely hospitalization older contacts force teachers go get exposed this. Finally logic reason sub. Thank you. seem want deaths hope get locked again. Remdesivir even work. Though Trump probably going GILEAD side come November third. Nobel prize please Anyone commenting actually watch event? and, wasn’t exciting, great job keeping safety precautions. Everyone masks on, competitors ate inside plexiglass cubes, maybe 15 people total watching event (mostly competitor coaches) sat least 6 feet apart. even talked competitors couldn’t come due NYS travel restrictions. seriously dystopian stuff watch don’t think result pandemic increases. referring governments general populace, specifically. 

But said, strains East *and* West. Correlation != Causation

The evidence suggests South West seeing outbreaks wearing masks socially distancing become politicized large numbers people refusing follow guidelines whatsoever. 

Closed air recirculation systems may contribute secondary spreading people choosing go out, driver still closed human contact. Typical fuckwit. 

They said don’t care quarantine. in, don’t mind it. co workers this, sneeze snort. step back, look baffled. damn chin. clock hang around nothing face. almost like opening bars letting groups strangers get shit faced good idea! knew....! Day 1(or 2) opening bubble, PEI 3 new cases didn’t they? Although believe nursing home probably related

I live hours border crossing lineups cars insane. Really hoping didn’t soon numbers stay low. Time? Well much, part. virus hits filter (given fibers laid standard high efficiency filters) pretty much stays there. wouldnt surprised along became national code issue (primarily cities would assume). Im sure need stamp illness out, wiuld UV light longest straight track return, well one shining right filter kill whatever else can. Regardless though, even ACHR news several experts wondering much pf virus even passing systems past filter (there havent many, studies done exclusively covid 19 know of), whatever amount standard system already seems minimal.

Of course would still need mask, would close contact higher risk apparently jutted supply vent. study China air conditioning unit spread covid? Turns flawed study people got infected restraurant actually sitting immediately near spreader. proved, sickest all. Sure, pre existing doesn’t mean “something before” means something chronic, requiring ongoing treatment ie diabetes. federal heath care executive. executive also gutted ACA passed Congress learned Tik Tok video. Literally anything risky proposition pandemic, sports whole 'running other' thing baked in, making tougher. Additionally, athletes owners (mainly) millionaires could afford take year risky. 

As others posted, 'Bubble Tournaments' like NHL NBA planned *might* work, MLS rough spot right due poor quarantine planning testing. Bubble tournaments house cards. 

If manage get control, maybe something like what's happening Bundesliga Premier League--it's possible, especially Baseball Soccer, sports relatively easy socially distance. half country completely control though, think we're yet. know viral load bad. 

Man way would want go one convention center overflow areas. Talk viral load. Lack ppe was, clearly, first reason many doctors died EU PPE shortages keeping confirming. news like make wonder it’s possible everyone hasn’t exposed already. 330’000’000 healthcare workers US. Science reporting always pretty poor. still poor now, stakes much higher. school set resume normal next academic year (I suppose province)? 1. need work compliance. Enforcement, fines, jail. Whatever takes. Shrugging shoulders saying ""that's way goes"" making excuses. 
2. School education day care. children behave focus studies parents working parental shortfall. excuses. 

Life difficult. Sorry, possible. work like that. “Orlando” ... they're one decide behave situation. get Orlando, they’re playing. Anyone like best stay away from. Inside outside, cause means everywhere else too. meant specific example dad running store. Someone talking close distance mask indoors? Yes, that's much bigger risk. important distinction even practically change much fight virus

If change much fight it, really important distinction? better nothing keep mind cotton material 2-8% filtration .3micron microdroplets vs 95% N95/meltblown polypropylene Non-sequitor love symbolism post. ... don’t link huh seem upset can't even understand trying say. agree certain degree. I'm Netherlands. never wear masks. public transportation. However, think beyond doubt wearing would flattened curve even quickly. 

The main difference far tell Covid Europe politicized. US devastating consequences. Agree everything except china number, waayy people easier lie look like ones bad enough shut whole world, kind weird would stuff like that. Greed's pretty strong guess right? sad statement young. information available, need made law something blatantly obvious pandemic? can't figure right thing own? hope true otherwise sure hope vote. public health consider average person average. Reminds Carlin line: Think stupid average person realize half people even stupider that. Literally Hitler elected way. least learn poison ivy poison oak leaves look like.  Yes, verge happening right TX too. also time, still feels like March me. It’s lost 3/4 months nothing normal since then. Note portugal actually higher number cases per million residents UK. Barely higher, higher. ICU =/= hospitalization. think metrics confused. That's science works ignorant. spreads 'like wildfire' mean airborne. I’ve read find this. statistical studies (that never discuss environmental demographic factors comes explaining covid prevalence) single actual study hamsters supporting masks. That’s it. Finally. I've waiting get fucked 20 years! really arguing lives people going ended Covid worth it?

BTW 25% unemployment would never allowed stand. 

That make revolutions. are, six pints.

Keep change. got ten minutes spend it. 100%. even takes keep earth habitable, fuck shit up. “Absence evidence isn’t evidence absence.”

Not this, sorts reporting past decade. Saying “we evidence that...” almost negligent given people read headlines they’ll interpret phrase. 

Instead headlines saying “there’s evidence airborne transmission,” said, “is virus airborne? study needed.” Idk, seems smarter you. artificial virus designed lab. Im sure full surprises. Exactly weeks massive protests looting.

Hmm must damn restaurants fault! Condolences family friends suffered killed corona behalf. war veterans, never thank enough! Like fuck's sake

My favorite story retail week is: guy son come in, tell door needed masks, put on. Later day kid came back in, mask, said “you wear mask store.” wasn’t customer glanced me, pointed heart said “pulmonary” went back talking coworker. told “I don’t care have, don’t mask get store.” I’m manager, manager actually standing like 20ft away, I’m pretty sure I’m one store cares masks... course.

So, let’s remember teachers also spread too... forwarded WhatsApp. Yes. It’s true. Luckily recently ~less dangerous, day started talking mutation could problematic. forget think it’s contagious? mean decide... stay home, wear mask!

Nor stay (what ever hotel is) last night. :)

Airborne means precautions using weaker thought.  also mean indoor open areas bad idea now. can't stop it. even put everyone homes two months could keep could figure get food everyone get people hospital need stuff like still going going around. scared.. yeah easy say easy do, right? 

Um 100% count vaccine time soon.  Like common cold stuff going challenge get rid much know yet. yes group settings indoors while. 

Sorry. sorry two situation. Nothing done either late. Unfortunately, sped kids parents foster families care (at least city schools) want house break. (at least school) wear masks give shit. going peatry dish Covid. 

DeWine knows people can't work public education system (aka free childcare) running that's sacrifice he's willing make. Can't keep paying unemployment, can't keep funding schools, can't win either way figures ""why not"". going get bad here... likely next Florida rate. absurd. specific reason certain apps stopped. Tik tok there, even made news. Also read western outlet news India. quite easy sit country surrounded friendly nation small population pass judgement countries surrounded hostile nation. guess much intelligence left western society anymore.

Nobody advocating rushed vaccine. told internal circular lines leaked without context. claim government medical organization. reason responded used word India vaccine India trustworthy world vaccine actually comes India. guess jog racist stereotypes.

Send virology questions comments twiv@microbe.tv think they’re hinting specific school without trying name names Given rate Covid infections spread recently California, Florida, Texas, Arizona; expect see lot articles soon.

I also expect much worse within two weeks. every Country values lives citizens. outside perspective, Americans seem ridiculously selfish quite frankly completely ignorant. I'm sure going full Nurgle, too, whether know not. jail public endangerment. feel healthcare workers too. 

It one thing flock New York flared first US, essential get control ASAP. 

But risk lives going areas, ones control politics, MAGA, mask opposition freedumbs sickening thought.  Bit also creepy, racist hate American citizens. going already. case TX starts jump around mid June give another week two death. seized upon literally used every anti-masker justification wearing mask.

""Hurr durr work small virus. Like fart screen door."" Finland never closed kindergardens, 1/3 kids going whole time. Schools opened 2 weeks May 14. quarantines exposure. news kids/teachers getting sick. I’ve lucky easy me, don’t much experience trying anything coffee water. everything I’ve read said black coffee, water green tea. Anything calories break fast. I’ve also seen people say anything 50 calories ok, usually avoid calories. 

I didn’t plan fast, woke one morning decided every week would push little longer could get 20 hours. Fasting - everyone drinking water day, especially fasting. get hungry fasting - chug much water can. I’m amazed well suppresses appetites! also use water reminder app reminds drink every hour get focused work (or reddit) forget. generalizing, particular case, I'm probably fucked. teach French foreign language official (public) language schools. students could teenagers, depending school get sent to, probably adults. Group size, 30 per classroom. 

My students usually uni students professionals. year several teachers, hospital workers, university professors supermarket workers among them. 

We can't comply 1.5 meter rule, space, authorities refused set lower cap number students per classroom. 

I probably fucked. Well can’t get away anymore thankfully ""I heard"" ""they're saying"". 

Everyone's expert sudden. people saying option herd immunity without even able spell properly. People hate staying lanes. airbone - (not airborne?) surely peoples homemade shitty masks dont help case expensive according various people today. PPE 'shelf life' like anything else. time, plastic degrades, cotton degrades, etc. masks become 'tainted' germs. county Georgia starts classes August 3rd teachers arrive week prior. I'm south Georgia, youngest's school gave us three options 

Virtual Distance learning way, skyped in
At school masks distancing, hybrid come certain classes certain days, option switch either full time

Our governor exactly brightest crayon he's ok.

I fully anticipate time Flu + Flu B + H1N1 Swine Flu Corona get hoppin fall, alot trouble telling people what, quickly enough contain large spreads already large outbreaks

And we'll mostly go back distance learning Everyone state (Victoria) Australia freaking second wave around 70 cases day. 12,000 day, signs peaking slowing down? Insane.  Yeah, realistically should, glancing it, picked ""tested negative"" thought ""so *really* virus.""

It's stupid, second read, comment makes total sense. one time read comment twice. stated purpose ""you need mask"" ""doctors healthcare workers need first enough.""

That flagrantly wholly untrue. coronavirus spread tiny microdroplets emitted coughs sneezes float air, rest surfaces remain infectious several days. Standard flat surgical masks don’t give full coverage, small droplets suspended air still get get saturated moisture mouth nose 20 minutes. they’re wet, longer form barrier viruses trying come likely pick virus touching remnant left behind surface touching BC definitely show discussion. 3000 cases far thank god.  technical perspective, social perspective matters. people may little bit embarrassed wear mask, wearing ""cool"" one may enough push decide wear. Typically end memorial day (~last week May) Lol wut? opened later did, they’re behind us now.

Nowhere ended pandemic, places reopen people get moving around reignites again. That’s works, nothing fundamentally changed.  Maybe entire scientific community agree? Hospital didn't..... took massive outrage issue us N95s. aerosol generating medical procedures (AGMP). 

they wanted us use face shield surgical mask COVID patients. Pretty much everyone refused get n95s. 

but government trying anyway could cover lack preparation pandemic wanted sacrifice frontline workers cover ineptitude. I'm sorry hear that, father grew financially unstable house hold kid, told hard growing never take anything granted ""out spend needs"" 

The man actually drop high school get job help pay mortgage

And right nothing changed America alot people able see real problems plauging country.

I hope people seeing problems College disaster Honestly, Trump getting COVID may best thing country point. Maybe “it’s hoax!” people would finally shut hell listen fearful leader gets virus. Again, ""fucked"". 

I agree 24-hour news cycle however, avoid vast majority time. Words definitions. get invent own. This.

Unions median organize workers give finger decision makers.

Opening schools put faculty, students, community harms way.

If rates declining lot maybe, increasing exponentially.

There school vaccine treatment made widely available.

Let’s clear here, education existential necessity- wait.

We technology work remote, need take advantage this.

But let’s 100% clear decisions financial political decisions science based decisions. think NYC got hit hard? Apartments, busses subway Camps families sleeping outside. 

Camps bunch kids counselors different households usually sleeping sort central housing facility. 

The basis claim odds transmission lower staying household socially distancing vs gathering bunch people. would, might. I’m (just Clearwater). keeping ourselves, social distancing, going (had groceries delivered). Wearing masks interact anyone. beach good. Plenty room spread out. 

However driving gulf blvd yesterday signs pandemic. Outdoor seating bars restaurants packed, lines get in, groups people everywhere, single mask sight. 

Hopefully things settle bit weekend. Good luck!

Air travel might activity that's higher risk learning. :(

Well, okay. Hospitals full COVID patients might top risk mountain. fuck even mean? think virus can't kill state? Thank you. really hope so.
Our cases doubling every ten days prime minister today said point blank lockdown tourist season ends. That's another two months. I'm terrified.  using company's covid19 attendance policy avoid busy days large crowds unmasked people able take mental health day.  Unfortunately store decided retaliate employees cutting hours unable pay rent month next month.  people refuse wear masks fucking clue kind damage everyone. adding vocabulary! Can't wait excoriate florida man even 2 weeks Issue classification aside , semantics. huge differences transmission rates two. Face shield protect droplets anything airborne transmission. makes ""airborne"" classification particularly scary viral payload require liquid shell around reach farther places. Protocols inside outside change. Imagine walking outside smell cigarette marijuana smoke. look around quite sure came from. That's far virus propagate. think someone made commercial spread vape cloud people might actually get it. think using visual brilliant. What? I’m southeast PA literally haven’t seen someone store without mask since March sars-cov-1 Good grief. know country lot trouble they’re yelling employees wearing masks. Except fucked though you? Unless 60 underlying health condition chances dying covid statistically insignificant. Healthy? woman obese. Young people America much higher stress levels never helps you’re ill. work more, facing much economic uncertainty, less likely healthcare, likely share living spaces on. us see 200 kids, course day come contact 3000. work rooms one two windows security reasons can't even open 1/5 way. yet office workers working home would surely required wear masks. same. Glad know doctor fucking time machine. We. Have. NO. Clue. long term effects virus. Anyone says different idiot ignores science. friend teacher Bronx. said teachers died COVID also lot parents died. Yes that's literally said. Funny list horrible labour circumstances created among awful things teenagers go through, facemasks aggressive customers new. wonder many recognized Trump's foolish words. thankful child care educator, live South Australia. 0 cases far. However I'm sick, I'm lucky Massachusetts. person wearing mask. everyone else. stop things getting you, stops lot things getting you. can't hope vaccine trials crippled people UK US simultaneously wishing us healthy lives. That's like saying *""I hope people US get cancer. wish healthy lives though.""*

Just clarify though, taking issue vaccines whole, end-stage trials disproportionately conducted poor countries? can't figure anti-vaxxer trials conducted? aunt. husband critical condition. asking prayers. crying. fucken awful. granddaughter even got (not bad) 

That month ago. Facebook saying it’s Hoax worried virus. trump god pulled through. worse NY Florida older population much weaker health system. remember early speculation covid airborne sub. 

People waving around paper that, saying ""no"", spread via suspended moisture droplets.

Those originally known airborne feel somewhat vindicated now. Yes, essentially knew already, least many pieces research confirmed it. That's main vector infection. Stuff objects like food containers low infection outside rare spreading (assuming properly distanced someone). nation politicized virus somehow thought virus cared politics? Like virus people, really care beliefs. one goal, infect host.  position hospital management would way would trusted WHO. stuff sprouting back early days delay coming forward information transmission rates appease China criminal demonstrates agenda detrimental worlds people. It’s inevitable national crisis affect children’s mental health. can’t shield pandemic (and I’d argue shouldn’t, kids don’t stay informed won’t take things like mask wearing seriously), help cope. Oh yup that’s definitely (from grove believe it). Parents TamIami tell everyone masking they’re relieved. Well rate cases increasing florida may lockdown tenure economic uncertainty, would same.

Gotta pay mortgage. Unfortunately, get control level fright articles like induce. you, may make overly cautious paranoid around others. me, could push lay bed wait die every time feel ache twinge, death inevitable. 

Death permanent disability serious issues, information *needs* followed data showing common occurrence is. Otherwise, scaring people implying occur everyone mostly everyone, may true, people handle fear even ignore fear (I wish wouldn't), people already constant state fear, compounds makes ability live life quality emotional health near impossible. 

I agree ignore statistics. However, think swings ways; ignore statistics go without masks crowds, also ignore statistics goal scaring everyone, people already scared minds fall ""everyone"", making hard function day-to-day basis. need acknowledge even people sick affected this, may compounding struggles continually instilling fear them, even they're right thing. California, too. neighborhood turned multi-block party. feel like U.K lot safety rules regulations U.S, least that’s I’ll telling get warp speed vaccine. Yeah, shit... think same. Given average person idiot (with virus least) stairs get much traffic elevators.

But lack ventilation worries problem tail someone occasionally. No, explicitly says aerosol.

We've known long time. important scientific differences airborne disease aerosol. cannot stand shitbook. used active go connect fam live long way month. absolute trash feed beyond irritating, it’s like Hotmail filter flooded junk mail falsities devil doesn’t need advocate right now. ITT, people understand political cartoons masks don’t anything airborn unless air blown polyester surgical masks n95/p100. Cloth masks facilitate aerosolization mystery wear masks, respect others generally clean people. big difference suspended air certain time airborne. 

From everything read seen anything say airborne, suspended air short time. Yes know COVID-19 stay suspended air since February, mean airborne. 

Airborne means particles small easily carried air currents, travel air vents not. 

Would make sense could potentially be? Yes, definitely. scientists go releasing research proper way? hurts credibility. 

I disputing claim airborne, criticizing method release formation. Damn, early that, haha It’s really not. Lol. u ever met logical drunk. Yeah, mean could bad ideas wanted nobody would cared much. death toll ideas actions resulted made infamous. Freedom excuse too. It’s hard you’ve indoctrinated believing government, POS(oops, mean POTUS) downplays it. economy,for numbers. 
It’s mind-boggling many people willing jump back society, knowing virus skyrocketed. (Or perhaps, mind boggled, buggered up) comes pandemic economic meltdown , thing that’s certain nothing certain. Umm, no. thing ""atomized particles"", least far know. aerosol consists liquid particles small light, float air time. test infrastructure handle it, entirely possible. Ontario wide! Well, forgive ignorance!!

/s

As fellow Canadian, apologize recognizing Ontario center universe. Chill Karen, chill. Where's associated jump death rates expect? see it. Even Sweden pretty much done it. Clicked Nature article posted. Published April 2020. 

“Surgical face masks significantly reduced detection influenza virus RNA respiratory droplets coronavirus RNA aerosols, trend toward reduced detection coronavirus RNA respiratory droplets. results indicate surgical face masks could prevent transmission human coronaviruses influenza viruses symptomatic individuals.”

And yet... are... know UV light (outdoors) killing rona. Ive heard people within scientific community say transmission rate low outdoors sunlight **DEFUND DRESS PANTS!!!** airborne everyone goes outside it. Genuine question  America doctors play darts people's health? developed world doctors aim come preliminary diagnosis treatment begun, choose appropriate treatment. 


I'm sure developing countries like USA. Remember though beerless leader said going *disappear* *99% infections harmless* residents weekend line eight hours car get COVID-19 tests

I cannot understand how, richest nation world, acceptable. Unsurprising coming Kochland. also remotely good way estimate 1 10 Americans antibodies. 

I asked guys CDC report linked news article quotes red field saying “up 10x Americans MAY infected”.

Literally mention antibodies methods anything. Phony claim. Disarm, demean, deride.

I believe second. still given state 10% decline daily new positives.

Over 1,000 cases less new cases yesterday! I’d like see Governors produce steep decline. treatment

Not US unfortunately word ""pandemic"" I've around lot beach cities LA mask wearing definitely 50%. inland, OC, even worse. People wearing masks socially distancing. American hard think due economic reasons. biotechnology playing major role holding economy, hard think leader tied two together. old drug help create economic growth like new vaccine would. Yes, actually. world stop natural disasters time Spanish flu, flu there. They’ve already said they’d something like 300 million doses ready October... south suffering due air conditioning, stop repeating nonsense. I’m we’ve using AC months due 90+ degree temps. low infection rate. media creating misinformation confusion, usual. Granted, scientific terminology extremely confusing well. There's difference ""airborne droplet"" vs ""airborne"" transmission.

Normally, airborne droplet means someone sneezes, big particles spit fly contain virus, usually fall within 6 feet large heavy.

What doctors saying microdroplets also infectious, linger 20+ minutes air travel 100 feet more. seems likely, since people restaurants gotten infected seems like air conditioning spreading it. 6 feet social distancing never anything ""safe"", minimum number epidemiologists thought would effect reduce spread. safe, like 20 feet even indoors.

Airborne different method. means need small particles saliva survive, survive dried pieces dust linger 12+ hours longer person left area. much much worse there's evidence this.

Here video showing movement microdroplets: supermarket, heard someone coughing storm couple aisles away you, drop everything get fuck out. travel across aisles easily.  known protection sars virus respirator mask years.

There paper single person took whole apartment complex 5 buildings open window, breeze recirculated air safe friend 

Given circumstances, wtf even mean serious? READING while, jesus still lung pain, shortness breath fatigue. days sleep. can't take dogs even short walks yet. got sick March, I'm hoping symptoms eventually go away. European. Nobody's laughing US, we're stunned great country could turned disaster zone. numbers significantly.

We didn’t even break 10,000 new reported cases FL residents yesterday. way see it, infections skewing younger that’s good death rate. eventually grandma grandpa get it. There’s absolutely chance catch New York play “it can’t happen us” game. could farther truth. That’s crazy. least Schaub known moron got punched head living. I’d expect better commissioner. sympathy “innocent” people - don’t sympathy beach goers. list denied bed. (well china record keeping standards, much) transmission schools since reopening.

Similar results mitigation methods Korea Taiwan. 

There's chance possible make schooling kids least reasonably safe. 

...I think. question belies facts Covid-19 causing devastating systemic organ damage, subsequent financial ruin ""recovered."" Stop trying downplay Covid-19. Reducing infections point. research currently public mask wearing COVID shows huge benefit. uses forced air heating New York?

I admit I've visited, did, saw radiators place. Forced air may exist, never saw it.

In experience, forced air heating inferior form compared radiators. get hot, dry air blowing you, uncomfortable feels drafty. New York, important comfortable heating systems since used much.

Here Texas, forced air heating, that's best method. air conditioning important, already ducts, cheaper piggyback heating that. well aware that. nuclear family stayed inside together. anyone us early March, would now. none us early March, none us get it. Haven’t deaths falling US? Cases scare people sorry hear man. I've much disappointed humanity virus pandemic don’t think Disney open Well so... Seems like pragmatic approach would richest country world throw bunch money order ease suffering death. Well think okay first, live here, even though stole election deregistered three times, well open state early, right he's mask tour.

As in, literally flying around state promoting, well handing masks begging people wear them.

By definition, would say that's better president, nine governors including Florida. 

That's humble opinion lowly Georgia resident, take leave Fuck. really miss Jerry Brown. Love hate him, point political career didn’t give shit thought right. Really annoying parents trying push keep 2 kids school “for foreseeable”. don’t money childcare we’re work, plus need proper education back.. I’m downplaying severity literally 0 children died ages 0-9 Spain, China, Italy name few. try point realistically chance 0-9 year old dying covid gotta something like 0.001% tell “but IF?!” Let’s goddam real there’s risk everything financially can’t pay childcare can’t leave alone?? sincere question. created false dilemma comparing ""hermetically sealed homes"" ""well ventilated space"". 

The choice two, trying frame way. People ""hermetically sealed homes"", neither kids post ""sleeping well ventilated spaces, breathing fresh air"". kids sleep in, camp puts it, luxury accommodations. kids probably sleep air conditioning fancy cabins.

Homes sealed. even know get notion. leak air thermal lot. US ones especially bad both.

And kids parties too. Check video K-2. dance parties smoke machines. kids kid version clubbing minus debauchery alcohol.

The question is: much kids interacting infect other? Turns out, enough. Unless sleeping group accommodations, bodes badly schools. 2020 keeps chugging along ... fact I’m referring to. Oh.. oh no.... people difficulty counting high... sickening Trump politicized virus point actually killing people. Trum supporters vulnerable take cues Trump. spellbound; Trump wear mask, wear mask. Trump says flu, supporters believe flu. Meanwhile hospitals capacity operating triage mode determining lives dies. heavy evidence lending weight supported hypothesis via firsthand studies conducted virus epicenters fact airborne transmitted virus.

However, process research would necessary prior formally publishing theory could take years isolate degree certainty would required confirm prinary theory transmission.

By time enough people would already dead it, even matter medical community published numerous studies lending weight support theory airborne transmission.

What matters is, enough evidence medical community supporting warrant discretion treating though certainly order prevent deaths. far bleaker alternative ignoring evidence provided published articles, proceeding reason take papers indicated seriously, watch number deaths climb. school start tommorow polar opposite except 1.5 meter distancing. 
We wear mask time except recess. bad feeling this. It’s Canada leadership telling serious, listening scientists, wearing masks, isolating exposure, turn political issue. I’m American Canada everyone BC province work took stop spread bring cases far reopening without another surge cases. home 3 months- university closed mid March, allowed back research mid June. opened dine-in services end May. sacrificed time friends family, stayed home much possible, worked. America going okay many governors jumped gun despite meeting standards set White House reopen, seems like there’s one willing voice reason tell people do- put mask, keep distance, limit risk. It’s fucking complicated. stuff like personally believe mandatory everyone United States needs go kind food/retail/service-industry work least lifetimes. worked off-and-on starbucks two years end high school beginning college, even though know objectively experience nowhere near bad could been, typical WASP-y affluent neighborhood, rush hours still absolutely horrendous get even pre-COVID. regulars/customers nothing respectful/understanding went forever appreciate, one asshole would yell new girl started working last week drink *absolutely perfect* could completely sour rest shift, sadly would lucky one.

Working kind job feel immense impact sense empathy whenever order something now, knowing person I'm talking could well kid saving money spend college, manager took another shift help rush even though kids home. One fastest ways lose respect someone realize treat ""beneath"" society badly way. even partly case, still large uptick hospitalizations nearing capacity. Right, that's getting at. 

Unless they're trying muddy waters reason (RE: efficacy masks), what's point presenting anecdotal evidence, admit means literally nothing, drawing conclusions it? 

It's almost like know people naturally draw conclusions anyway. Since incident happened, evidence ease surface transfer getting less less robust, evidence airborne lingering become available. I've known guy 30+ years, strong suspicion foray covid quite bit uncomfortable described. Default response big egos. Lol. ground glass opacity present means lungs doubt inflamed point time. probably felt like hell he's type admit it. speculation. previous post facts know. Okay. know someone got tested charged $250 long ago city. going believe online reddit know people actually got charged. post removed cannot verify reliable source.

You’ve got point. first amendment word word, *do* go symbolic avenue becomes incredibly slippery slope. IE “I see pants sign oppression, I’m wearing public” counter argument see quite bit that’s one mild example. 

It’s issue never should’ve politicized first place, supposed “leaders” knew damn well shit storm opening making so. There’s much could undig get it’s worth places it’ll get removed quicker shit goose Oh, know. changed got worse. many nurses/CNAs, etc going come work wearing fucking surgical mask knew airborne? 
 
I even see legal. again, enough money matter lose lives due negligence. need N95 material, less. breathing dense fabric make virus stick via *Van Der Waals* forces they're entirely useless. Hi,

My name Common Sense.

You might heard me. sadly people refuse remember name - even said countless times them. seriously. refuse remember - like they’ve said “Nope. refuse remember you.” protests weren’t issue 98% people wore masks reduce transmission rates. 

Also, think protesting basic human rights LITTLE important drinking Budweiser tanning. checked facebook page, yup, still planning. really words it. didn’t say that. fact, haven’t said single thing that’s useful. 

Which brings us back main point. going debate you. really. way data reported Swedish authorities raises number concerns, put mildest way possible. clear, example, serious time lag reporting cases deaths - deaths particular. might seem like small things you. isn't. Oh. Cool. Coolcoolcool. What's postive rate ? beach - establishments beach. Young kids small cohorts masks much possible. Middle high school kids home. Ah, good know. Thanks sharing. Hopefully hear back tomorrow agree you. I'm american, please think us way. Huh? Real question: fucking bandana t-shirt mask better nothing pandemic control, would N95's *at least* equally effective? Hey, what’s name Yemen’s prime minister? Quick, don’t google. know? Sri Lanka? Haiti? bet don’t know. people don’t talk countries though should. part CA? ever say sure there. That's incorrect. States like Texas, Cali, Arizona, Florida seem undercounted much 50% beginning months pandemic. Northern VA dove morning gathered basic kit could use online programs. already use prodigy liked Moby Max (the teacher used eLearning challenging them). total less anticipated able include stem resources. made something seemed daunting seem doable. Thank much again!! understand understand danger. comment willing take risk well measures go along making sure transmit others chance contract COVID result taking exam. Turmeric key. We're getting sick shit. dentist office actually called day husband’s appointment tell needed park car wait parking lot someone came get him. put mask walked hygienists office. time leave walked different door wouldn’t let touch door knob. appreciate they’re doing. high-risk husband gets infected, could mean death me. People don’t follow rules held responsible people end hospitalized die COVID-19. sad part is, they’re following actions POTUS 45. Trying again, since bot care one words chose first time around. would feel exactly same, fact folks going expose people - including healthcare professionals. Point please freak every single number hear. Put confirmed number headline, speculated number. stir fear. [Meanwhile, deaths Covid-19 steady definitely let's report that. Definitely let's post sub. No, let's post hypothetical number healthcare workers instead. Really? easily mail order say 50 $200... who’s going check? Even save lives, get trigger political right. teacher Texas, approve post. don’t think propaganda new, think new way seeing reach people. 

And appreciate point. think social media dangerous. mostly people appear idiots. 

I wonder would suggest charge social media improve things. (?) **［July 5th OUTBREAK ALERT ］The COVID-19 pandemic situation deteriorating rapidly United States.** following 10 developed countries states United States reported new confirmed COVID-19 cases far today (will keep updating since countries U.S. states reported) :

🇺🇸 Florida : +10,059 new cases

FIRST responder situations lethally armed officer. situation escalates police get called. first person scene someone gun trained de-escalate even manage situation they're facing.

China exception. Kids less prone contract virus. Belgium, schools reopened halfway May similar rules far hasn’t outbreak (and whenever parents kid tested positive, whole school would quarantined tested). 

As teacher, required law wear mask though.

*According Vazquez, common age infected 20 years old.*

So it’s young people spreading among thankfully critical. droplets rate infection would slowed spreading fine blistering heat People subreddits still like “we accomplished goal lockdown, hospitals aren’t overwhelmed”. I’m like “yes are” basically react “la la la can’t hear you”.

It’s disturbing, we’re facing worst case scenario right people literally disputing numbers coming hospitals. Cant mask n95 respirator? work hospital Treat covid patients. required wear mask time hospital, surgical cloth whatever, n95 higher dealing covid patient. Many employees choose wear n95 time. That's true, account that. I'm remembering correctly, NY higher death rate attribute undiagnosed infections. Jacky boy you? Alarming? mean expected? know consolation you, hearing Canadians acting way gives comfort. feel almost like I’m crazy wanting people put damn mask, outdoor events sit chairs six feet apart. one friend, one, respects this. know it’s show me, appreciate it. It’s silly take precautions poor hospital staff choose turn away let die. feels incomprehensible Bullshit 

IF true would understand mucus membranes absorb virus. true would know N95 mask never intended stop airborne virus. would understand airborne transmission means following CDC guidelines REDUCE, eliminate chances getting virus. 

Pull one bells on. literally recommend masks rather gloves respiratory virus. possible criticize cdc, public officials, who. dropped ball early continue make stupid mistakes.

as fucking march 30th [WHO still doubled saying masks unless Im offended people making serious order cause chaos country crash economy political gain. Lifelong scarring? Lol virus around 5 months. Nobody knows shit lifelong effects. facts virus fails kill host 99.7% time, part incapable even producing symptoms many cases. always airborne. mean coughing generates aerosols droplets. Even though droplets vastly exceeds aerosols volume (they much bigger), aerosols nevertheless generated.

This known even SARS. suddenly someone says aerosols generated coughing contagious? coughing droplet precaution? mean wear N95 TB way less infectious COVID, suppose accept standard mask? Ridiculous! Dead people take hospital beds, sick people do. treatments improved and/or virus less deadly, means people less likely die less likely get sick.  media kept saying protests issue outdoors, one going think that's OK going beach not. forgot California.

That's difference sure link f'd up. pointed couple others, here's think correct story: starting understand, people give fuck lives others. Wait IC beds run out, blaming starts. I’ve struggling say won’t make sound like hoaxer something. But, yes, death rate likely reach NY levels know lot effective treatments. 

What wish people would focus well deaths is: 1. long lasting lung damage / non-fatal life-altering conditions coming virus. 2. ability personally bankrupted end hospital complications even ICU. 

Even couple insurance could hit $15,000 copays go broke jerk didn’t want wear mask. Agree w last statement. covid patients home urgent care rather taking hospital bed

Just make sure. part statement nothing UCI beds correct? saying hospitals putting people UCI there? happened since first week protests? also, recall Boston Tea Party? celebrated Independence Day yesterday, celebrating looting destruction property. worked fighting fires Canada would routinely make $300-400 day thanks overtime. Basically summer job, small amount training (just tickets), Nomex, good go. Governor Abbott... ""LALALALALA! can't hear you!""

Lt. Governor Patrick... ""You die greater good economy."" Looks like 10-15% state whole. live TN testing increased 10 fold, yet less 5% ICU Covid related. media report increase cases... Without mentioning sharp decline deaths hospitalizations.

People realize nearly full icu large hospital complexes make money.

Source: work large hospital organization else people going protect faces 5G signals? someone start rumor that’s best way protect 5G? Well wrong sense current situation US control parts world getting shits together. happens “girls wanna fun”. bad social safety net deficient. hardest part yesterday telling kids going sitting another holiday.

Please wear mask. might right one: go right ahead sign then, buddy. job keep family alive. going one giant shit show schools open fall.  Ga hot mess. governor arrested jailed public endangerment. shit show Ron deSantis continue never ever happen future.

Why Floridians still patient take this? pretty much imagine headline next two weeks.

Refrigerated trucks
Doctors nurses applauded heroes (whats point now)
Nobody told us Covid bad
Florida man thinks mask doesn’t work. Good point.  drive hours day stop hotel rest begin next day? may take week get home this, would probably safer. that, options good. enclosed space (plane cabin) 3 hours bunch strangers bad. airlines even keeping middle seat open anymore. Tampa region big outbreak hospitals filling good either, especially pretty sure mom can't stay home. guess, want advice random internet stranger, would suggestion:

Best option - drive home several days stopping grandpa needs break

Second best option - fly home, try get flight middle seat open (or three sit together row). Wear masks convince also face shields. Wash hands frequently trip

Probably worst option - stay put. worst mom trouble staying inside. could convince this, staying put might option 2 Exactly 😀 Remember Floridians vote President matter. makes much sense, powers never go it. sections op ignorant fuck, America. brother contact someone tested positive covid 3 days ago, yesterday became symptomatic, today parents became symptomatic really euphemism much drunken hookup *peak* lowered inhibitions. term applies sorts behaviors normally inhibited good judgment, hooking - stealing, driving impaired, speeding, picking fights people, saying shit would never say, flow ""lowered inhibitions"".

But right, drunken fucking also likely massive spread rick.

it lowers inhibitions provides false confidence - people scare tactic. people hospital infection average two three days. like NYC, peak go away. There's plenty space. Well that’s Texas. little behave manner northeast virus control. one's responsible except people involved incidents (or people encouraged them). 

This article comments play fantasy whites racist. Blacks whole responsible whites are, responding bigotry stereotypes who's blame going solve anything. hard, I'm I'm naive enough young people meet up. 18 locked months, would lose plot would gone out. false 30 conditions 99% people make full recovery. Actually would say close 99.5% lack empathy towards unwillingness learn NY caused it. Feel free say loud. UHHHM EXCUSE XIR walls racist. human controlled go. Amirite fellow rational nuanced thinking lefties? Context matter. People allergies though. Unless making 100 identical sandwiches without touching ingredients reasonable change gloves directly handling food components like meat veggies hands. death cult worships Mammon that. reason open colleges/schools year. would traded birthdays memory. would share predictions, would nice... Myrtle Beach hospitals maxed that's good kind local Berlin tracker. actually feels good grip many infected people area many getting infected daily average. Oh, guess everything cool!

What point? don’t feel needs ‘enforced’ force. becomes socially unacceptable enough one feels like pariah going store without mask, overall compliance become number % people don’t piss corner store simply wanted leak. BBC.  really think it’s presidency?
You naive blind hell. Lmao wut, yes good get data things analyze data already answered one,

No didn't.  know why. sorry feel way, implore consider George Floyd killed aggressors right-wing paramilitary force left calling end type injustice. Consider, also, injustice started continued said aggressor. Finally, consider victims right duty fight back. Yeah, I’ve tried making comments like these. worth trouble. narrow set opinions aloud here. Awww, c'mon bud. resorting critiquing English rather responding statement post? Canadian healthcare system rated higher US system every publicly available, reputable ranking. outright hilarious would claim ""it's slow"" -- without sources stating much -- disconnect Canadians obviously feeling way. slow, Canadians love much? New Orleans goes again, make sure tell go east time. See, goes ways. But, booboo. completely stupid moron leader, happens.  I’m not. agree America perpetuating virus pandemic. However also think China responsible creating optimal conditions viruses spread humans first place. think us non idiotic North Americans, US Canadian alike, crowd fund sort Public Service Announcement.  


Reddit lot talented creative individuals, I’m sure could come might get people. Informational animations like kurzgesagt video. short explaining exponential growth hardest hit areas, happened (show crowded beaches bars holidays). Followed footage overflowing hospitals, refrigerated morgue trucks. Voice overs doctors nurses frontlines. Maybe people young healthy life long complications Covid (breathing trouble, kidney damage etc.). prove isn’t elderly sick danger.

People seem want realize enough patients, even modern country can't offer enough medical care. magically appear nurses, doctors, PPA, medication, on.  
 
It entire point initial lockdown example many EU countries: keep number patients manageable hospital care sufficient supply. 
 
If look Florida, 200k cases, 5% daily increase active cases... end well all. Remember NYC lockdown number cases peaked *they* manage. infinitely worse. would certainly good news. ways discovered better treat virus? big issue. Privacy laws, well social taboos, prohibit showing morbidity hospitals. result, many aren’t keeping informed becoming ignorant what’s going hearing “oh, corona still around getting worse” tangible feeling.

If major news outlets social media platforms regularly showed, pure morbidity, also vast volume existence, may scare population taking things much serious.

This clear perfect example “out sight, mind. don’t see it, don’t hear it, can’t smell it, cant touch it, can’t taste it, isn’t actually thing” happening since May. 

Even neighboring SoCal counties ~50% hospital Covid census Imperial.  

These cases flooding due one extremely low population rural county especially like rest Cal. Americans living Mexico. family lives near Tampa. surprised situation is. Mismanagement weak word Trump aliened state government done. Sabotage acuter. delaying unemployment payouts firing data scientists refused lye statistics, ending quarantine direct opposition medical advice, Florida's government consistently put $$$ life. One drive bar month ago see coming. good chance someone recently took car left behind nasties you.

The science seem indicate transmission occur person person. (Your first point still stands.) Heh, I’m danger moist sigh? threatening me? Gonna whack cane?

Must South Pole redditor. Less 15% inpatient beds Texas used covid patients. guys really believe that's unmanageable Tfw need Hilary Duff act voice reason instead president...  right, published July Absolute numbers would helpful here. knowing hospitals full ones could 8 beds 40% full could 80 icu beds. Ok considered it, what? think would get away this? flattened curve, gave hospitals months deal it, havent oh well. Actually they're fine enough job FL, TX, AZ... expect big land grab this. shares parallels treated indigenous America hundreds years stealing land. Whole world farts general direction. 

That's bit much. I’m sorry know ? I’m physician Miami zero idea talking mass protests major city’s bad beach scenes partys war day, anything cases dropped.

Was outside? ""Outside"" functionally infinite volume air virus dissipated. Seeing spaced activities outside safe using justify packed drunken pubs wild jump looks like, said, UK *trying* provoke spike, knows line activities. 

Maybe that's somehow good idea economically speaking, go hit point went far pull back know getting every drop safe economic reopening possible. 

BUT non-terrifying idea populace trusted immediately comply pull-back line crossed, drop cases back down. modern Japanese people 50 yrs old eat fish regularly; young people Tokyo eat lot ramen, tonkatsu, curry rice, eggs, fast food, meat ""healthy traditional Japanese diet"". ""Lowering inhibitions"" typically euphemism certain type of...intimate act. 

You know, one social distance drops zero. also 4th July weekend. ICUs see spike weekend. lines evidence ongoing studies looking this?

Yes, much certainty. Existing thread: Look buddy cant make assumptions wild card. 

But thats thing? Good luck. That's point. deflection failures administration mixed fundamental anti-science philosophy. lies death cult leader matter them. American feel completely helpless due idiocy fellow countrymen. political wear mask. People want stop spread help fellow citizens  would great time hospital workers Florida go strike.

If people intentionally try kill stop em. certainly never agreed loopholes thing exceptions. That's point comment - distinct. teachers die flu season every year keep going work. Particles denser, doesn’t mean theres trajectory traveling through, especially air flow carrying them. Touche. absolutely right What’s capacity icus? “8/8 beds full” like every “we 8 stories icu tower 20 icu beds floor capacity” said literally nothing makes sense shortages vary state state based prior planning/preparedness? think Louisiana lot testing anyone go get test easily right now. know real problem prostitutes right? county hasn’t reported since Thursday, well all, around 100-200 new cases every day lately population 200k. know this. also know it’s dangerously contagious spreads like wildfire, incubation periods make difficult stomp out. Let guess, there's way could associated protests, RIGHT??? think right that, except last part. country even keep **bars** closed pandemic, argument necessity public good bars provide. Going bar frivolous recreation. open schools, well meaning people, lot choice (having work pay bills need place send children day) suffer it. rich kids sit one out, gotten nanny, wfh job, stay home spouse, etc. saw well. bother? know long term side effects, study lung recovery looks decent 2 month follow up,  recall correctly comparable better SARS1 lung scan follow ups.

E.g. couple bucks local liquor ""Trump claimed May he’d seen proof theory, contradicting intelligence services.""

This proof probably Sean Hannity mentioning conspiracy theory Fox News. wrote post yesterday actual numbers information. FLORIDA, ARIZONA, CALIFORNIA NEED LOCK DOWN. But, won't.

TX:
-Ten 12 hospitals Hidalgo, Cameron Starr counties (the Corpus Christi area) “diversion status,” means beds full, although Hidalgo County spokesperson Carlos Sanchez said it’s “fluid situation diversions may lifted moment.”
-DFW hospitals seeing record high numbers, full ICU's converting entire floors ICU overflows. (I work DFW hospital) Also, last week adult patients transferred children's hospitals DFW Houston.
-San Antonio hospitals diverting patients nearby cities. Several Houston ICU's 102% capacity. VA San Antonio beds...

All hospitals ""staffed"" capacity currently. normal day non ICU, given nurse 4-6 patients... even level get spend quality time patients run room room, charting, spend day ""putting fires.""
Right almost standard nurses seeing 8-10 patients. Meaning admitted anything beyond upset stomach, monitoring anything minor, getting substandard unethical levels care. Hospitals given normal day mess strained running 75% capacity... most, all, hospitals populated areas state running 95-100% capacity can't handle load.

TLDR:
Sh!t F**ED beyond words. Lol panic porn sub. seems worked treat countries. half-assed shutdown coherent leadership, stupid. actually no. already answered one, another youre really reading shit much coming onto reddit argue, dont give shit do, put back pants, walk. accurate statement. also accurate statement say teachers going die schools reopen one type face mask made filter pockets. fusible nonwoven interfacing well.

People people. saw face masks sold one layer cotton fabric, used gauzes materials, on. I'm means expert child development. thought brain pretty amazing likely could eventually figure things out. might take additional resources get though. 20k would quite nuts would blow away New York's worst daily numbers, 11-12k per day positives, New York pretty aggressive testing much possible. IQ 100 yesterday holiday followed existing trend Saturdays would essential tie death count last two weeks. best, number would lower, may 50 deaths prior week 

The trend longer significant decrease, flat. Things also appear moving towards increase soon well. mean suffering lack person social contact. adults halfway responsible could raising ruckus masks cases would low. Federal government power unless declare state emergency across country.  let states thing, unfortunately many failing. still can’t bring post death data related Houston. that? You’re bullshitter worst kind site. Sad life. They'll make enroll pay usual. make sure they've got money. they'll wait first covid case campus. soon happens, they'll send everybody home offer refunds services rendered.

That's bet, anyway. We'll see. sucks education line. that’s sf small part whole Bay Area. live east bay everyone wears mask can’t go anywhere without one won’t let in. People seem following protocol even Newsom allowed bars restraints open many Bay Area counties open instead followed set guidelines. month ago dozen states seeing cases increase, three weeks ago 22 states, day 40 states. doesnt need full lockdown people distance properly wore masks, people dont wanna sadly. places probably closed though ones valves breathable don’t protect kids you. know I'll get downvoted, feel like city police give tickets refusing wear mask, protesting lockdown, traveling plane, give records hospitals. allow hospitals give priority treatment following lockdown. 

Not fair people staying home whole time, wait behind bunch idiots denied virus gathered crowds. warned repeatedly. made choice. 

Not prevent priority treatment, let wait, nurses doctors dont need stress much. Well Latinos Blacks mostly essential workers whites top laugh shame us even though backbone. No, flattening curve intended *protect* hospitals becoming full overwhelmed. 

But Florida opened early result never really saw flattening. verge seeing worst case scenario Florida covid. 

Most places seem like 8-10% mortality rate (to positive tests) kinda expect Florida higher maybe 50k dead Florida? accounting deaths causes due hospital capacity. 

But expert - laypersons opinion here. thought Obamacare made thing could charge age. We're flattening curve like we're paying 30-year mortgage. behalf U.S, hereby nominate r/jamesbrowncrackpipe first line recieve vaccine. Seriously? telling protestors standing 7ft apart other? high? Guess talking common cold one. Braindead Everything made possible vaccine happen October. does, Trump suddenly win presidency. doesnt pretty much automatically lose. question comes vaccine. Oxford lieing help Trump win. Others might impartial No, see, celebrating Fourth American way possible, protest, it’s actually fine. confusing infections infection rates. Protests cannot explain sustained rate increase transmission rate. protests responsible would seen spike decline. seen therefore protests responsible situations seeing now. clearly botched re-opening lack mask wearing. teenager went first day camp (people sensible mask time, get nice things now) change mental health overnight astounding. guys!!!11 they're clearly exaggerating. stay home drink soupies! That's flu I'm fine! /s Truth Quest's guidelines COVID-19 sample collection state collected samples could stored -20C week option store -70C, find time restriction those. No, experts need justify huge salaries... Lol what? haven’t covid cases? That’s true. agree we’re good we’re still getting new cases albeit small number NHL bubble success say death rate, meant deaths / Million population, nothing tests N95 masks goggles stop kids infecting cough face. think doctors treat kids COCID-19 use protect themselves? N95 masks goggles. Sounds great! hope right. Everything bigger texas, big brains thinkers there. one truth here.

I would recommend reading comment could explain further, answer conundrum already answered comment. That’d kind shitty way it, though. Travel nurses nurses take 3-6 month assignments different hospitals across nation, wherever license. Sometimes better pay, sometimes traveling, sometimes finding job fits best. pay used fantastic compared staying one place, unless there's healthcare emergency like now, pay merely average time. ways make better like living RV, fancy accounting, working specific areas like San Francisco. also allows work ass contract take time afterwards vacation such. aboard!!!!!!!!!! Calling Boomer Buster virus reason. least beeline canadian airport send Europe. would happy welcome there. /s

Though think read Americans already trying this. Canada build wall, make Trump pay it.

The Great Deal Maker would it, likely give away New York state every state NE make easier ... especially could turn trade kind money laundering scheme. Besides, would allow distract transferring Alaska back Russia. one Korea, instructor infected lot students fitness dance class, none yoga class. researchers think workout intensity, suspect yelling instructions loud dance music vs speaking instructions soft yoga music played role. Talking may bigger factor currently account for, super-spreader events (call centers, bars, resturants, churchs, choirs, weddings) places people talk/sing lot. would help explain Japan outbreaks tightly packed trains culture favours silence.

People largely speak gym, many specifically forbid yelling, possible no-talking environment protective role. People early US shutdown talked weirdly sweet everyone actually talk connect emotionally wanted connect all. 

I think quickly progressed breaking rules name nut busting spreading disease, brief moment ""oh talking nice forgot that"" sweet see. Horniness distracting. know stories people posting, regular bed census high right now. given public data, anecdotal stuff like best public do. instead shutting AZ, CA, FL, TX, shut whole country? got states ignore beginning. Report county health department. writing. Usually government offices need respond keep record written correspondence. try state senators assembly-persons district. you’ve seemed eradicate it, open back up, cases return.

Go look Hong Kong South Korea doing. never ""open back up"" never really locked down. get outbreaks spread like wildfire sort ""artificial herd immunity"". wearing masks extensively making accommodations social distancing.

We way many dumbasses going put masks know alternative martial law style lockdown. Deny job they'll likely convicted again, keep using cheap labor/slaves. Fuck Replaying NY. would thought could learned. realize “guidelines”, virtue nature, easily ignored what’s going now, right? aren’t enforceable.

What want law. nice, warm fist keeps us safe. traveling nurses usually work agency instead hospital, get sent anywhere country agency covers needs nurses. usually make 6 months nurses make year. Way better pay, way worse assignments country get executed spot disobeying mundane rules.

I hope family next round ""unexplained"" deaths What's worse late now. Even schools magically 3x budget hire teachers cleaning crews, forth, teachers going come from? There's already teacher shortage many places due profession underpaid respected. 

Realistically, would start building corps teachers least 3 years ago order enough safely reopen now.

Not mention schools simply enough physical space socially distance. Good luck building/buying new school building 3 weeks class starts back up... Might wanna reevaluate statement problem ones never one symptoms even family/ friend know affected nothing gonna change mind precautionary guy patently insane. another ""art project"" defiles road-killed art, years now, endlessly celebrating sickness depravity.  roommate caught protest Cincinnati. It’s illogical think protests didn’t spread coronavirus, even weren’t main cause. day zero covids American hospital. Everyone wears masks times public. ignore feds. worst fucking part us New Yorkers already went this. paid debt terms sacrifice. I’m essential worker terrified go work peak. 

Now anti science Bubba schticks yelling MUH FREEDOM wont wear fucking mask. It’d fine affected him. Survival fittest smartest case. bubba family NY. There’s mandatory “quarantine” state visitors. Good luck enforcing someone like Bubba won’t even wear mask. We’ve already seen slight increase cases. 

I’m really looking forward another lockdown noise hear middle city ambulance sirens. It’s fucking horrifying. 

I really hope investigations starting top government way local. went suggestions health officials need see jail time. Including president. problem media.

We’ll see forgot Facebook. cesspool spreading anti vax corona hoax propaganda boomers eat like popcorn yes, lack mindfulness mask wearing concerning. live pretty sure covid-19. 

I always wear mask, wash hands, hand sanitizer time. Honestly take serious family members(many bbq's parties) besides mom I'm shock might it. Started getting symptoms earlier week chills, fever, fatigue, headaches morning woke feeling like something sitting chest. I've lost sense smell taste too. able get tested said maybe 7-10 days results. I've spoken doctor thinks I'll ok given age health let know things change get worse. Thankfully, cough want sleep day wake tired fell asleep. Look Japan. Little unofficial lockdowns pretty much ubiquitous mask use golden fluctuates based time year due tourism travelers spend winter (snowbirds). Summer quietest times we'd sometimes even called work due low census. floors would see numbers low 50%, others like diabetic ward, yes Florida many uncontrolled diabetics entire unit dedicated , would rarely see less 80%. utter nonsense. 500k?

You know would really show them.... You, mask, visiting ICU going around family friends. 


That show sheeple none real, hoax. physical therapist, would assume similar nurses, get ""sent"" anywhere. choose location setting. Obviously demand means undesirable locations options, conscription post implies.  ALSO SURVEY TEACHERS??

Of course parents want someone else deal freaking kids day jfc Also decent chance vaccine never found Covid19 constantly mutating. many infected USA rn, assume changing rapidly. Ottawa I'd say mask use 50% what's reassuring 90%+ people adhering least 1 social distancing mask wearing  Antibody tests exist widely available. They're good enough place quite yet give accurate precise result. provinces, perhaps all, still extensive studies testing tests.

The walk-in free testing Canada standard ""Swab-up-the-nose, do-you-have-it-now?"" ones. non-medical family members believe well despite fact 3 front line medical workers family tell time real. plot China ruin American economy way take Trump. think virus go away election time. make things worse they're anti-maskers. That’s offensive. let's pretend bullshit reinforced corruption past years nobody spoke  lose bread butter though elective procedures cancel. see won't, locked Florida NY got crazy. Florida headed stratosphere cases. get it! send kid school go work... Georgia here...

We really failed workable plan place parents could work kids could get education childcare need, without putting anyone undue risk.

Mandatory masks worn properly consistently central point, course makes sense, conservatives holding us back. That's bullshit. There's way know someone contracted covid certainty. people contracted even they've otherwise careful. Wow, almost like set up, checking donor lists........ life evaluating sources information, ignoring misinformation. 

Yep. shame actually teach schools given probably critical knowledge needed navigate 21st century. Actually, kinda like masks. They’re homey, like blanket pulled juuuust so. apologize way looks like agree believe imaginary point Trump would trying make.  

2 percent 10,000 people diagnosed daily Florida high number us accepting. nice thing c l z e healthcare making sure neighbor healthy saves taxes, hence saving money.

It's wonderful system incentivized help fellow man time. yeah, important thing right Trump's re-election public health RiGhTs Florida's lack empathy caused problems, showing similar lack empathy cause new problems?

They told, probably lot listened learn. virus discriminate. bounce guy grocery store picking essentials land asshole acting like fool. acknowledge foreseeable hold leaders accountable errors still showing care empathy affected. Nashville fun city (pre-COVID). impatience putting cloth covering face interacting people global pandemic? fuck it. Herd immunity new plan. Open up. yeah places even asking people went protest. smh see, talking different statistics. talking deaths per known cases. got wrong way around professional concerned get work done, done right, rather participate idealogical warfare, stupidity killing people right now.

We need step want reach 2021 less 200k deaths. husband moron. 

What hospitals gain right appearing “full”? 

All would mean shutting elective hospital procedures costs hospitals ton money. Yet see hospital administrators sounding alarm Houston Arizona. you’re Texas make fun you’re permission quietly judge us *most* definitely 2 years. heck guys notepad copy paste every couple hours? live near pretty important hospital Tampa, like 2 miles away. definitely worrying me, governor shit slow cases. closest thing try slow closing ***some*** beaches two days. Wearing masks authorizer state wide, 12,500 new cases per day 4 days ago around 9000. Counties sued people want wear face masks end putting general public danger. incredibly fucked. unfortunately Fauci, think government, hands tied. Trump's solution seems ""ignore actually address anything"" much hope. don’t even get N-95 imaging department. considerations appears virus beginning run course. Would ""burn out"" similarly populations? 

It ""burn out"" eventually every population given enough time. may take long time cause way more/fewer deaths depending approach (such Sweden vs Norway).

Sweden lot de facto cultural measures like social distancing staying home sick compared to, say, US. super surprising they're seeing similar trend response (first wave, decay) lot places. 

It's magnitude trends changes based preventative measures. Remember, social distancing masks curatives--they slow spread ""flatten curve.""

That's tests processed Saturday But, tests may performed time ago. I'm sure current lag Florida, hard hit states backlogged much week processing tests.  masks help great deal reducing transmission new testing shown moderately effective wearer

The ""moderately effective"" wearer good enough since many assholes refuse wear masks all, making ""great deal reducing transmission"" part moot point. Things like IT, medical software integration, meeting endless paperwork requirements insurance reimbursement, meeting maintaining requirements federal funding, managing endowment, etc...

You could argue problems exist solely privatized healthcare, yes. centralized healthcare also comes set different problems. 

And last point- would agree 100%. CEO hospital multimillionaire, he’s sharpest tool shed. definitely doesn’t provide enough value system justify salary lol. dad twins, congrats. best luck. Handling two already challenge. cannot imaging three infants. Seriously tho kid school told teachers everything every one doing, you? You’re good person. hope get different job use talents. DeSantis nutjob. He's part Republican part Satan fully racist. I'm sure fake news. even prove Florida exists? budget surgery dental work Americanos notice. parishioners patients, thank you. EXACTLY! Costco Alaska requires masks, social distancing etc. NEED mask mandates want keep people alive. late, would save lives. false 30 conditions 99% people make full recovery

This *very* inaccurate. patients side 3 year old gone 3 4 OTs last 2 years. good us norm tell therapies people day one. happened loose therapist got assigned. case manager put someone clinic years happen again. I’m cheeky bastard Yeah. recent study showed 17% antibody rate Stockholm. discussion Sweden last week lot around immunity black matter. I.e. potential reason immunity despite antibody tests show negative. study Karolinska Institutet suggested large proportion people cells give som kind immunity Covid19. sure? said cant

They say lot things bullshit. breathe without mask?!?!?!? understand point going lol. Phase 3 coming late July/early August. Open fast already know happen using America example. scientists couldn’t agree face masks? steroids? HCQ? bbbbbbbbbbuuuuuuuuurrrrrrrrrrnnnnnnnnnnnneeeeeeeeeddddddddddd think lot people fail understand profit/fiscal based healthcare system extra overhead. good day hospitals least 80-90% full normally. ...you're right ...I supply big data every else keeps hospital running... Gonna try anyway, science purposes course. it’s unconstitutional make wear mask! god given right make children sick! No. Incorrect country 20x population Netherlands. assuming enough doses, simultaneously. That's quite assumption. vaccine distributing dispensing three different things. That’s it’s spelt anything else incorrect Norcal particular best call pay nation, get procedural nursing role oncall, clear 200k year easy.

That said, lot oncalls prioritized staff nurses rather travellers dependa hospital. 50 ""most risk"" lol Well that's true anymore, least Ontario. hospital's mostly back capacity, COVID-19 patients. man, feel like stores need employ bouncers days protect employees types people /sad cares assumes applied amount thinking first time... change registration though - least Grandma didn't. Again, went happening, charging people Banff, etc. blocking road. immigration offices. Miami physician talking taking ski trip Utah April? Either lying physician seems bit irresponsible

You deleted comment ""physician"" called figured I'd try here.  think hitting point Trump trying make. test obviously cases we'll find, worse optics look US. (obviously he's concerned optics average joe)

the cases positive especially young people wont die, less threat it'll seem Americans push back restrictions there'll hypochondritis symptom insanity? paying you, China Russia? facebook.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* know, I've watching known positive tests death rate while. highly variable, even within USA. Internationally morbidity rate crazy variable testing per population. American citizen Rights inalienable, since obviously don’t know, way take away someone’s inalienable rights Constitutional Amendment.

You wanting act like tyrannical leader exactly founding fathers set Constitutional Republic form government Democratic one think special American brand always skeptical rejecting everything including facts equivalent yelling “no one pulls wool eyes me!” Well safely say I've restaurants less 10 times adult life. hopped back keto train myself... 20 lbs quarantine far! Race 200 lol would little bit, lived lost. I've always thought Canada happy place. Execution sound like blissful ignorant version Canada Former Floridian here.

Can confirm.

Also, say theres bar? single doubt covid. Every single thing I've gone known symptom. nothing like cold flu, like nothing I've ever experienced. like aliens invading brain. Also, person infected Mom (Mom coffee park friends times Newsom opened county) found covid lesions lungs three weeks got sick. covid. testing unreliable, probably hundreds thousands people positive going around think they're negative. 'Murica stop never stopping, Florida. studying Coronaviruses. one reason know much them. wear damn mask confess,I know Harry ""Rabit"" Angstrom, MU limoncella. fairly easy read Updike, easy speed Micron tough get drunk limoncella. lost limonene, I'm afraid. right. sure does.

Say...what's favorite color? like blue? important, someone single digits low (lower limit healthy 30). ever quit supplementing, exhausted, get minor illnesses way easily take longer recover, generally hurt/ache more. take vitamins time, feel good, sleep better, always motivated things. spread US again? 

It pretty much is. John Hopkins Coronavirus dashboard critical trends page shows 50 states color red right now. means cases trending upwards. 3 main reasons.

1. Treatments doctor practices much better March. alone dropped death rate 30% Im guessing.

2. average age people infected really low Florida. Older people protecting Florida actually done well nursing homes. Death rates waaay higher elderly FTFY/ Months, maybe Years.  Also live SA, I'm firmly ""moderately overweight"" category height gender get told I'm thin ""just little chubby"". city's idea healthy damn joke. lay flag coffin. damage control bad press. **ALWAYS** ask ""What's favorite color?"" want subtly insult someone. Works online person. 

It's best say ""Wha...? Blue guess."" hard burst laughing. No. huge reason people don’t take action lives change it. many doctors don’t flat prescribe healthier diets. It’s also bastardized people stopped saying “accept yourself, work towards positive change.” Instead say “don’t change yourself, makes get huge dopamine hit.”

Just watch latest Halo Top commercial disgusting part fat acceptance message. ones running get Reddit echo-chamber see I'm right. becoming minority world waking realizing worst humanity running world right instead best. Period.

He millions people listening. Whether likes not, give dumb dangerous tales thinks funny. May offer suggestion ""Brave New World"" i.e. people become willfully ignorant order maintain level comfort really surprise though? Americans travelling following quarantine rules here... mention cases linked Myrtle Beach 14 days get vaccinated, I'm soooo gonna take uber favorite tex-mex place drink eat fajitas. technically rights suspended yet enough people refuse courteous fellow citizens create crisis proportions would require martial law, yes rights would suspended. might WWII worldwide crisis requires extreme societal coordination teamwork extricate of. 

And individual responsibility, 100pct agree. come back full circle Bill Gates [WHO says COVID 19 cannot transmitted asymptomatic State-owned media suddenly turn shit government changes Denmark.

We also tend elect people like Trump, could related less toxic divisive media landscape overall. 

Then again, issues relate first-past-the-post two party system. clear message early masks worn people unless sick. plain simple fact. fact wrong leads mistrust. Anyone misleading people timeline events so, doesn’t change fact experts fucked guidance led mistrust skepticism. Rightfully so, since average person smart begin with. wear mask, certainly understand people aren’t. I'm middle-aged 30 lbs overweight. still run longer physical feats none peers do. also cardiovascular issues. Granted strong athletic background, shows overweight still healthy. say woman post still range doctor tell us healthy is.  China ! makes u think 130,000 important? Get America.  You’re dumb brick think that’s case bud.  True, it’s already stressful time pregnant. I’m pretty sure us taking every precaution possible (or maybe that’s overly optimistic?) 

And maybe I’m little sensitive, bothers people say, “oh, underlying conditions.” people something qualifies underlying condition, doesn’t make death suffering less horrific. Feel free let know you’re coming she’s hospital, either LOL. might enjoy Chris Voss talking difference ""You're right"" ""*That's* right.""

When blow someone ""You're right.""

When person actually heard you, understood you, shown empathy ""That's right""...and probably going whatever person asks you. dont think exactly 25%, could more, could less, definitely ""lower 10%"" wtf americans outta there. Smart move. strain officially labelled "" BENGHAZI-CoV-2"" price electing morons scared. sobbing terrified puddle ground type scared, definitely overly cautious paranoid scared. There's way know beforehand end severe long term effects never experience single symptom. could take anyone time. People try quote stats say big deal, ultimately stats still mean could potentially take anyone. one even close immune thing. would anyone gamble impossible truly know even odds? Good News ? about... BRA? Might well stop now. Rogan buddies Rinella, he’ll back show. tho? meat eater crew seems like Good dudes. Florida actually larger population Ontario; 21.5 million people Florida compared 14.5 million Ontario. 

Mind you, still much agree - 11K cases personally would suffer kind mental break. always find neat enormous US states are. owners bar positive employee arrested.  Bergamo strain spread across Europe February. That’s he’s getting downvoted unfortunately, 100% crowd would comment shit like unironically non-sarcastically even months back. got reference immediately seen user enough know they’re spot whole corona situation, appears unfortunately took seriously guarantee wasn’t case.

I’ve there, I’ve also downvoted hell making comments meant parody taken legit stance enclosed space without masks, anyone super-spreader (often symptomatic yet) infect half office. show decision makers case studies this? informative illustrations.

I’m happy managed make “doable” questioning exactly means what’s doable option parents. really wouldn’t die hill. lab studying make coronavirus' transmittable humans, then, coincidentally, city lab exists, turns ground zero Covid-19.


I believe coincidences. 70% countries declining 1 new case per million people per day.  experts careful say masks ineffective—just hadn’t time complete research showing effective. One world’s leading public health authorities going make recommendation based gut feeling disease like diseases.

Really? seem foggy memory. doesn’t seem like carefully considered cautious reccommendation. It’s direct instruction wear masks aren’t sick. 10,000 people Victoria, Australia refusing tests.... REFUSING TESTS... 
you assured weren’t Facebook would problem 130,000 americans dead- one cop literally unimportant every sense word. Cops lives important 129,999 died, millions people whose actions increasing death toll. people morons (not coincidentally) also happen extremely pro-cop. harness particular character trait save literally thousands lives. 

This situation serious pretend single cops life important anyone else.  forget banned sale N95s? absolutely nothing recommending cloth masks. mention position flawed misguided position they've years, completely idiotic absolutely indefensible. current lethality rate 4.5% might mean 515 deaths.   
For batch.     find 96% similar ones lab though? course removed traces every strain lab fits, would wildly irresponsible. also removes knowledge virus research would gone it.

If vaccines fail, Chinese one breaks I'll certainly think came there. bad doubt governors Texas Florida put place lockdowns again. track record great Really? Look date article, count six months forward, please. Let know find. cares cases?
What matters deaths hospitalizations, decreasing now. Total mortality even lower normal still going down. Real talk - I've met kinds people different walks life around world.

The consistent experience I've Americans **always** dumbest, ignorant ones. take like 3600 IU vitamins supplements got levels tested beginning June 38 mg/ml, deficient bottom ok range. I'm glad started supplements months ago. went starbucks day without mask serve me! moment, denied $12 soy mocha latte, knew exactly jews felt entering Buchenwald barking dogs, screaming germans, gunshots, death around me, fear, despair. barely able haul back Volvo SUV, made b/c hot Yoga class attend 2 instructor really cute. horrible horrible tell you! record plenty doctors prescribe Meth six year olds older plenty live past 30. 

It’s dosing protocol.

😎 personal experience tell you, Austria also fair share idiots running around. They're everywhere, US exclusive. Literally can’t hurt so, help. GOT start calling people out. understand shame. Yeah, they'll get mad dig heels first, people growl behavior, EVENTUALLY they'll face much harassment fall line. Nope.

Again narrative dying people realizing passive acceptance nothing make things worse.

The entire world coming together fighting going stop.

Educate research issues world protesting fighting see entangled fighting change world stop die.

YOU problem wrong world.

Wake fuck go something make world better place rather call people like world crazy seeing truth fighting take corrupt running things.

Again we'll fight ready join us. understand either. USA really bad part country already, suffering must nonstop news place far away easily dismissed, home already. medical academic people seem alarmed. 

The political people, seem understand could problem.

I understand, little overlap two groups. That's yearly influenza virus mutates fast, particularly variable weather half planet winter, half enjoying summer.

That's need World Health Organization keep track outbreaks provide reports. know positive right got false negative? Ranks 6th testing Africa, world Yup.

The Rona bit test see Governor dumbest.

I mean knew Florida, still. whom? Many places free flu vaccine administration year, even pay it’s quite cheap. widespread administration lead lower costs production insurance coverage.

Not mention increased hospitalizations far expensive vaccination programs. Came say this. Nah people involved F1 highly intelligent unlike lot people US I'm partying beach, I'm peacefully protesting states increasing again. places restrictions states, although I'm sure they're enforced. generally think every state increasing threat every state. number deaths per day averaged roughly 4200 last 6 weeks Trump's long con!

Bill rambles like indicates finished college good using mama's connections IBM make fortune brightest bulb bunch. No. mean number deaths per day. peaked April, spiked bit end May declining since. time passes, less people die. guys think second wave lockdowns be?

I know people say can’t second wave lockdowns, numbers way worse thought worst case scenario early July was.  welp, looks like lot pulling through. think France Italy somebody said maybe 2/3 hospital overweight. 50% Americans obese overweight stat 2006. admonitions ""fat-shaming"", people even think health problem. know many dead are/were fat reported US. mistrust. countries already get fucked hard US bills government lying, ofcourse people think anything involving money burying ground.

Put end 'end justifies means' mindset: keep secrets think America better without people knowing it, spread trust people handle vote sensibly, can't, make sure education improves. Besides, people 'end justifies means' mindset forget need end well. listen people 'prevent terrorism', leads 1984 society terrorism preferable. militarize police world much, leads making enemies.

Become transparant, consider silencing conspiracy theorists: never expect silencing someone backfire. History shows censorship leads Sad, angry, disgusted, embarrassed, apathetic, depressed, anxious, etc. That’s happens people don’t want police. randomly take vit D, get enough diet harm good, often leads kidney failure among things like vit K2 deficiency (excess blocks K2) (K2 essential bone health), stomach problems look like IBS, hypercalcemia, check make sure deficient go taking it. studies know virus caused deficiency deficient prior catching covid. study think week /r/COVID19 looked levels prior catching virus agree deficiency problem.

There definitely difference Religion Spirituality. find many science-based people religious find spiritual. I, like you, discussed pondered friends inconceivably massive universe old is. Even many psychedelics, really makes question life is, created. look science how.. perfectly balanced symbiotic life created ecosystem, can't help wonder created. 

For some, religion helped dark times helped comfort them. Others maybe saved life addiction, abuse something else horrific. pros. However, completely twisted years morphed something sickening inevitably hinders us. right purest form, good teachings. Sadly, anymore. 

Overall though, opinion, religion good core teachings. need religion around us practice amongst other. basic principles life.

My husband decided quarantine 2 weeks return home. “social media” blame.

“humans” human-level IQ blame. Social media create meatbags would get outsmarted sloth. No, CFR would high. saw rates early testing extremely limited sickest treated. recent studies indicated overall IFR 0.5-1.0%, much higher rates people 60+. Even hospitals overwhelmed get anywhere near high.

America never get control. ever needed inspiration work it, social normalization, process ideas behaviors may fall outside social norms come regarded go 3/4 masks, 1/4 wearing always come type people would avoid regular daily life. wife says 50/50 goes groceries sees customers. goes way do. I’m one young people ignorant long lasting effects happen young adults too? Deaths lag hospitalizations cases, hospitals get overwhelmed (which simply matter time point way Florida’s handling it) watch hell talking Elon Musk? guess definitely easier us. can’t believe we’ve gotta point America many people actually anti cop.** shit goes south, people gonna call? fucking ghostbusters?

Really? point laugh....... it’s hospitals problem. President promotes mass gathering , social distancing doesn’t wear mask . need running politicians office. needs thing. Data lie... common. Maybe use homeopathic remedies prevention never surrogate actual medicine. Ive never met would bathe septic children omit antibiotics. Sure, also move Latin America say Europe Australia. 

I'm sure rich ones born USA, situations like would seriously make consider moving abroad.

You realize emigrating ""better"" country incredibly difficult, right? There's reason entire world can't move Sweden wherever imagining. No. Mine mild case, completely unnoticeable.

Good job! :D chance. whole fight Corona virus pretty much over. know people (ICU Coma) knew people died stop caring. care even experienced it. 

It fucking over. Even kills people know care. 

This happens create Apathetic country. apathetic.

If mass shooting toddlers Sandy Hook change people's minds issue nothing will. 

I wear mask understand people care change minds.

It's important get people mindset new normal must sustained indefinitely. Helping states equipment personnel certainly letting tourists CoVid ravaged states go frolicking around NYC. 

Also quarantining NYC completely different asking tourists/visitors quarantine (quarantining whole city vs. several people).

If earn lot, well probably got customers forced-closed shops. get higher tax burden, help ones shutdown.

[P r g r e v e] taxes actually really smart way tackle [C p l ' s] issues.

Side note, consider this. money, choices invest money. pick one highest return:risk ratio. So, generally, rich get richer. means time, money pool top enough masses. Consider issue Henry Ford discovery paying workers enough money could actually afford cars meant business BETTER, WORSE. enough masses, people starve pitchforks come out. system chaos. want that.

Thus, [P r g r e v e] taxes helps solve problem accumulation wealth. obvious answer problem well. addition things like short-term no-interest loans small businesses close shop laws preventing big business eating small businesses right now.

One ""theories"" see liberal new organizations ""People going ER heart trouble"". Ok......so die home still reported stroke heart attack. ""theory"" holds water all. Whether person goes hospital dies home, death still heart attack/stroke. 

Nobody seems able explain well. common sense answer would be, people hypertension and/or heart disease prone catch complications due Covid (that's fact already know). Therefore, dying sooner Covid complications due co-morbidity heart attack/stroke own. feel way heart disease? guys seem realize many morons Russia US.

There people genuinely believe COVID-19 hoax, anti-vaxxers too, spew worthless garbage Russian social media too.

You’ve clearly never UK Lol food isn’t mushy peas potatoes lot places shut beaches 4th July weekend. things going bad.  weep this. feel bad innocents caught madness.    
May 45th ring hell future callously responsible this. It’s feasible get actual numbers it, really think it’s indoor things causing problem. Tubing, beaches, parks. Keep distance groups people, stick small circle okay long you’re outside. 

Drive separately, don’t rent house together, don’t go bar, etc. article translation seems mistakes. familiar area gf live near fact go Rocky Point couple times year, provide background information:

A couple days ago Sonora State government partially closed border state Arizona way prevent American tourists visit mainly Rocky Point (but certainly areas either too) July 4th weekend. State Sonora hit hard increase covid cases recent weeks, local state governments imposed partial total lock downs certain cities. 

Rocky Point depends lot tourism relaxed measures somewhat, still monitor people coming city. Apparently Rocky Point authorities fact turning people back come city, people neighbor municipality specifically city Sonoyta. 

Taking account, riding border shutdown State government imposing , activist group blocking Americans entering Mexico much fear Covid way pressure Rocky Point city government letting enter city work essential activities claim. ""kills less 1%"" untrue? research first.   think NY 400k whole state, NYC... wondered experts comment using face shields outdoors. weakness face shields might little stop aerosols virus. worry aerosols hang air long time breathe in. much less likely outdoors. 

The average wind speed land 5 meters per second. aerosol blow away almost instantly. many cases, go people's heads harmless. viruses also might blown ground. 

The danger aerosols mostly indoors. perhaps face shields need outdoors. Bro sees stfu buddy. protests outdoors many many people used masks socially distanced. study mentioned link shows populous cities large demonstrations see spike, fact even saw decrease non-protestors felt inclined stay inside. far likely spikes we're seeing result shutdowns ending early, combined Memorial day crowds people observing social distancing/health guidelines indoors, places bars. Outdoors, virus lives significantly shorter time circulate air day. Probably applies readers post apocalyptic books, too. Doubtful. sure woman knows rights employer tries dismiss anytime near future, authorities state federal level intervene.

Remember: People well Trump Dump still jobs federal government refusing them. remember New York Governor going TV asking help states, saying New York going pay back favor. looks like good time Cuomo walk talk. So, monsters care people dying can't read wrote. 

Well, that's America. Ha. live river exaggeration could see 14 different fireworks shows. going 3 hours.

when weather heats up. lol  Live Kansas. confirm. Nope, I’m eating there’s vaccine. Maybe I’m paranoid, I’m also limiting takeout ordering too. Like, I’ll eat there’s company luncheon something. 

I can’t trust everyone working restaurants wearing masks properly. walking back hallway last week food court able see kitchen one businesses employees masks pulled barely cover mouths. 

I see enough people walking around public wearing masks properly distrust. I’ve also seen woman pull mask cough. New York’s height peak? Yeah like creating operating system runs majority computers world?  Oh yikes. done CVS test son got tested took 9 days get results. Labquest. possible backlogged holiday hear something tomorrow. neighbor works health department Cincinnati got home tonight telling go bed early working calling people tomorrow tell results. said huge backlog got extra volunteers call people tomorrow. hope hear something tomorrow hope kids feel better!

That's huge high risk. wonder many lives saved we’d told wear masks beginning? Hey dude loves orange tanner parties spread virus protests. lol y2k


total dick hand fear mongering skynet horseshit

the day surfing Newgrounds...lol domestic cases Beijing, still working trail find last stragglers. serology studies run gamut IFR 0.58% Indiana 1.15% Spain/NYC. going end 0.5% 1.2%. appeal, could make hundreds millions dollars government violated Constitutional freedoms. Maybe try something it? thought.  someone telling different ""lest"" 131 confirmed healthcare provider deaths span Coronavirus pandemic. Read article please. sad deaths could prevented.

However, title bit sensationalist click-bait. back napkin math put 700 deaths perspective, would ~14% increase all-cause mortality rate, much. better metric would look much healthcare workers suffer long-term consequences wear mask work fine second I’m work damn mask stays go back next day!  blame Disaster porn 1990s... Decades * trust majority Americans decent sensible people rest mostly really confused, hope least come senses election. learned anything pandemic, can't ignore people's problems, sooner later become problems. Probably Africa that's tell apart nurses doctors wish shared hope. would take medical advice Texas. ones leading grandma alter die economy. *Oryx Crake* Margaret Atwood another good one rebuilding biological apocalypse. That’s least 8,400 years education, including years experience. Ugh. need science experiments know masks protect pathogens. ... China almost zero domestic transmission.

The masks technically necessary, reinforce cultural awareness. Use ""."" .com /. well yeah

dawn dead......etc

yeah get mood scene

but realistically? Im still shitting myself.....so wtf Meanwhile Florida, friend lives posted pic bar like ten people crammed together drinking table tables near similarly seated. masks course. Tampa area. always talked jest, never thought I'd ACTUALLY see f*cking Zombie Apocalypse. Would perfect time hospitals go red. might able snuff insurance gouging insinuating they'll close hospital pandemic due unreasonable costs.

Watch people shit pants go insurance. Didn’t Microsoft invest Facebook early days? Sell stock. would kinda high. Thankfully mortality rate seems lot lower 2% young people  one saying this. Depending careers 700, factor formal continuing education years on-the-job experience training (arguably important classroom education), could easily multiple 10s thousands years. Nevermind cost education job training, nevermind cost human life lost themselves, friends, families, potential patients.

Now think 132,000 dead time. Think may *also* contributing world.

It's incredible loss. much could avoided, much additional loss avoid, fail avoid, future, things today? Haha nope. fucked. can't tell troll now?

Or trying get post comment self aware wolves? 

We showing safe. everyone get virus take 10 years hospitals overwhelmed. We're failing. healthcare bill alone push us debt. need rest world we're going economic leader.

If think we're best, that's fine. means looking information. assuming we're best, ignoring info contrary. 

Have tried flat Earth, maybe cult? need people like you! Didn’t CDC tell everyone March face masks didn’t work? Granted, think they’ve admitted knowingly lying. going go decades

...not anti-mask side. Public holiday US affects reporting. Except still know COVIB-19 confers lifetime immunity. Also good number people continue effects even recovering symptoms. real tragedy nobody really gives shit.....


THATS tragedy ever saw one..... Im sorry. sucks here. Well Berkeley popping months rich corporations still run gauntlet, states care long staffing met close enough, people community let us businesses know work. flatten curve country meds vaccine might already coming India. take also please I'm partial uff da. Malty goodness. Nothing surprises world regarding US. political cultural stew. agree, want note really hard hearing impaired read lips. got clear face shields aid communication without spraying around much virus dealing clients rely lip reading. They, course, aren’t huge anti-mask assholes\~ can’t tell hell saying. Well US probably date holiday weekend. Philippines also celebrate independence July 4 too? unacceptable.

I like 1 death Coronavirus unacceptable 29k 59k flu every year acceptable. like 647,000 deaths heart disease every year acceptable. like 600,000 deaths cancer acceptable. 1 Coronavirus death? Awful. Unconscionable. Evil. Lock down. like every flu season prevent deaths.  Yes joke, China could never take #1 spot U.S. anything. also laid fired shitty health care system. sad. lol know youre answering guy but

this aint 1941, case havent noticed ancestors time period raised us total pussies account major warfare.....so pussies became...... mean sure? I’m sure multiple reasons would difficult untangle. guess I’m little amused general unwillingness focus factors blame people terrible lifestyle choices (apart wearing masks social distancing). 

Japan 3.2% obesity rate I’d wager Japanese suffer principal covid comorbidities (eg diabetes, high blood pressure). suppose seems relevant Worst roommate ever. I’m nurse whole month March, family members texted called everyday ask doing. exhausting. dreaded texts. know love worry her. Please talk brings up. Lol wish minimum wage high bro LOT usa. compair one china guy let all. Good question. I'm even sure. Whatever is, I'm sure stupid. Im glad CDC debunking ""crazy ideas"" , leading authority things health related. Hes billionaire, course trust money, self interests , motives100% 
🙄 Ooh, read *Newsflesh*? intend reread it--I kept flashbacks back March. beginning worried supply. masks mandatory certain places. airport, example.

I also point guy widely thought wrong masks. He's one guy one university. people field disagree him. Dude nobodys downvoting lmao. see Americans agree well? Agreed. sort like trolley problem 1/10 people track die. Potentially even less hard know limited testing ability. Personally I'm going back gyms when/if open back area outside risk tolerance. majority gym goers also probably bit health conscious much better chance surviving. they're also responsible interact with. 

It's definitely frustrating since beatable. EU countries opening back success reacting new outbreaks isolation contact tracing. Part problem American culture ""rugged individualism"" general. friends hanging hanging pretty much whole time. One works grocery store cared pretty much whole time couple people hanging her. really want hang they're thing today really think safe. They're young people asymptomatic really know. feels kinda like STD like even hang people mostly careful I'm really careful expose one reckless person BOOM! Everyone Chlamydia. 

I pretty much acting like everyone it. one socially distanced lunch picnic hung blankets 6' apart share food brought lunches fun. I've couple people visit chatted masks outdoors time. Sigh. 1% people dying huge fucking deal. Jesus christ actually tough tell offensive completely idiotic. Like, goes far chart both, kind amazing bad way. Hey, shut up, Diamondbacks *need* stadium. Baseball must go on! Strange became epidemiologists months. US, Brazil, India, South Africa, Sweden. Seems like every continent one country really fucking up. NC beaches exceptions don’t usually look like this. there’s many people beaches, they’re packed restaurant two town, “Wings” town, pier town, grocery store town. NC beaches looking like pandemic absolute disaster. looks lower today yesterday lower Thursday safe say trending back now.  properly embarrassed ourselves. Governor Kemp going hear day now!!!! Exponential growth occurring people socially distancing more.  covid still positive antibody test. ""load"" may register tests, may decreased. places go get tested free without prescription. takes searching. went County's Dept Health, waited car 2.5 hours daughter got tested free. Results back 5 days  though. fine. re-open hospital, sure, suspect would take quite while. Also staffing issue.. know getting screwed incredibly selfish thoughtless minority. focus people breaking rules people get lax it. people know good here. people acting like big deal going business normal. even understand freedom angle. sure. none assumed one wearing mask, yeah, 3 seems bit low (just IMHO) I’m privy conducted research concluded groceries rare 3. “hanging out” makes risking lives job. Sounds like didn’t get invited. 
Well know several nurses hang mask-less selfless. saw protests. Tons people wearing masks wearing properly. Tons yelling screaming, btw would spread further, plenty shoulder shoulder contact.

yeah, saw plenty protests several maintaining quarantine otherwise saw consistent mask usage greater 90 percent. (like hundreds hundreds people San Jose literally handful maskless people)

Also, distance. sure crowds distanced?  agree transmission occur teh protests (which acting like Ive exposed month protesting)

What certain every protest Bay area far excess 80 percent mask kinds people protesting different idiots beach, they've already proven follow protocols protests first place.

Nah, reason think people want use collective action order address societal ill people want hang beach going same. instead alot reason think overlap follow CDC guidelines social distancing rules support blm.

frankly, propaganda right fucking us nation saying months covid big deal, favor blm total political posturing bullshit. protesters nazi shitheads talking stupid risking lives Americans.

Derp, derp, man, yeah, cause just, danger acceptable, risk management works.

It change fact large outside gatherings same. buddies want pay business interruption insurance

What talking about? 

Business interruption insurance excludes coverage pandemics. would pay coverage excluded? People coming here, getting sick, going home, getting tested home communities.

It still fairly easy obvious trace back origin. don’t like downvote function leave Reddit. helping moron doesn’t know leave they’re complaining something ;) 77k fucking lot Tahoe. Bumper bumper traffic. Nowhere park. Shut up. Somebody's ass? vast majority people recover Covid lasting effects. Please God, please take people you! really want. Unfortunately, thats new normal going get worse San Diego here. confirm.

Please throw population density stats me, population lives cities dense America's, cities around Great Lakes St Lawrence River, exactly large area. Canada empty wilderness hardly anyone lives in. Duct tape. shit fixes everything. getting PPE community donations. It’s disgusting. pens

Oh yeah, lung scarring covid 'no big deal'. Great take, buddy. Reaping sown. 

Not surprised. There's gonna lot covid babies year He’s baby killer. wants wipe population. can’t trust tolerant left  Didn’t see Karen couple days ago threw groceries floor one one checkout cashier wouldn’t ring without mask? think Costco employees want deal that? that’s exactly she’ll let fill cart refuse ring up. refundable deposit; get COVID get back leave. Tourism Minister trying get rescinded though, cuz wants leave deposit funeral arriving somewhere vacation. key also lie constantly, doing. Check comment history, lies tell insane. can't tell anything chart. must better way displaying data. that's true. protests cause, New York New Jersey still well? equate someone's intelligence common sense. local hospitals first case pediatric resident. tested positive NICU rotation baby NICU. find NICU. nurses followed protocol, talked shit blown virus was. beginning maybe they've changed, recently saw one nurses grocery store one handful people wearing mask. made blood boil. leader unironically call ""God Emperor"" tells choice never shows wearing mask. sure not, worried hiking daily. biggest industry gambling hospitality. many friends come close contact thousands tourists wearing masks coming god knows where. E pluribus unum loudmouth Heroes, all. need much better.  Murdered weaponized ignorance. also become RN associate's degree, well. GOP convention still full steam ahead. ""under God"" part added 1950s. similar US look forward Less people BLM protest, spaced farther apart, sunlight opposed darkness. Uh huh. people. Plastic bag?  remember listening specialist diseases NPR around time news Trump's rallies resuming came around. guest commented waivers people signing expanded include ""I seek medical care get corona virus attending rally,"" makes sense since putting life line, poor men women keep alive end getting sick fucking moron. Ive three protests maintained quarantine rest time. friends protested likewise.

At protests, almost everyone masked (at larger protests thousand people people unmasked, small protest went to, everyone masked.

In experience, venn diagram people take covid19 seriously give fuck BLM bunch overlap, much like Deniers lives groups make circle. provide source? 
It’s don’t believe you, it’s credibility statistics used reach assumption I’m curious about. 

I understand adoption nothing like picking puppy. There’s applications, interviews, vetting, trial adoptions, etc. 

Either way, 2 million people awaiting approval adopt, would stand good reason wouldn’t revolving surplus kids adopt, tune 500,000+ annually. 

Seems like cooked statistic me, I’ve seen source info. way long, healthcare workers fighting virus without proper personal protective equipment. Many hospitals systems still lacking. 

It’s like sending soldiers combat zone without armor, arming fork, thanking service, letting fend themselves. 

How okay? Healthcare workers signed impression they’d given tools get job done, they’ve let again. Like reddit? Masks effective certain period time. New Zealand government recommend issues make pointless. Fuk good thing Obama going right window ;) Lmao even help neighbor wife satanist. wore upside cross live tv. sorry wife! truth situation though. hospital system collapses collapses EVERYONE.
People car accidents.
People need cancer treatment.
Delivering moms.
Patients break bones.
Strokes, heart attacks, diabetic emergencies.
Children battling chronic illnesses like Chrons, sickle cell, blood clot disorders.

It COVID patients affected catastrophe. ""we better China"" Voting literally pointless, must know now. regressing literal temper tantrums mayor, Jason Collin, rolled business owners like coward. 

Insane. local officials understand there's ""the economy"" restaurants?? mean, guess restaurants ones bullying plan nukes economy too! \*Have wondered heart attacks strokes ALMOST non-existent year?\*

I call read helps.

If still trouble, provided two links another reply NPR NY Times asking ""where heart attacks gone"". Buy van. Society gross, every day live ""Free"" life held back literally everything. family, friends, jobs, debt. free means? know answers questions, friend. Maybe call county health department issued subpoenas already got compliance, like health department measles outbreak 2018?

[You really take deep breath remember expert everything, know, speak authority far greater matters know everything about. Take me, bad habit get into. heroic called hero’s 9/11 Mid August, Indian independence day. Hope rushed partly PR stunt. Plague rat. 

Fuck him, everything stands for, everyone like him. 100% helpful. Countries high mask adoption much lower rates spread infection shows masks useful overall. They're especially helpful containing aerosols exhaled sick people important everyone wear mask many sick people know they're sick.

Health care workers anybody else going constantly exposed tainted air however need much stronger protection general public due intensity exposure face. thought extended quarantine 21 days finding symptoms showing 14 days.  Shooting fireworks fun! I'm waiting Americans start crossing border foot like refugees immigrants escape dumpster fire. major issue (in America) 78% workers were/ living paycheck paycheck. possible effective vaccine cleared quickly? people like generalize much? ever software man get virus? embarrassed. ignore idiots adapt. Live life best resolved, resolved. ones embarrassed get sick family member gets they'll realize stupid live with. mean, yes Canada also measles outbreaks anti vaxxers, many deny climate change. One provinces big oil producer. We're innocent. think government kept things going reasonably well, plenty people given right circumstances would love take us them. mistake influential American media here. 

I confident yet area Ontario's willingness mask increase openings PREVENT area getting outbreak rather controlled cases.

I story town. employers son works popular restaurant take out, outside service. rain storm day group local government came served inside rules. local gov't conservative btw. Thank you, cried telling whole story. Instead fine, penalty wearing mask hours community service local hospital assholes see first hand selfishmess wrought. I’m mean hosted ted talk depopulating world using vaccines. European country allows people Brazil? Oh man. work STEM constantly encounter scientists really brilliant particular area expertise totally unwilling embrace evidence disciplines. Like, one co-workers really capable senior chemist knows everything know testing perform, instrumentation, etc. shithead wear mask, thinks covid hoax, believe climate change....basically right wing talking points. takes major compartmentalizing, guess. nurse advising flu shot might take cake. discipline! New York made fuss Trump suggested quarantining New York City peak New York outbreak. New York gotten virus control, wants isolate rest us? 

I guess Cuomo's statement wanting help states promising return favor empty talk.  sir.

In refugee camps would tell women getting vaccinated instead sterilize them. ""underdeveloped undereducated"" history Western nations treating Africans little guinea pigs lab rats. played 20 years Fallout shitty apocalypse?

[Contact Human](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=BokiTheCracker) Yeah, article 131 confirmed, super low. wonder many health care workers die flu every year? It’s mine, I’d surprised someone else hasn’t thought already - seems like obvious solution. Take clog dancing? Devil's advocate: majority Reddit users USA? raw death count that's problem, though. COVID uniquely terrible makes people very, sick. [20% catch require hospital care, enormous figure overcrowded hospitals New York New Jersey, forced make difficult decisions gets care doesn't. already happening Austin, Dallas, parts Florida. happens, people COVID still need hospital care also die. seen [this looked deaths March May 2019 compared 2020-- subtracting COVID deaths, stats show 30,000 people died year previous. going get worse. live FL. believe cases going up. However, percentage cases coming positive increasing (ex.: originally 5% 10%) issue. ""On July 1st tested 5,000 people 10 positive"" next day ""On July 2nd tested 25,000 20 positive"", genuine say cases doubled yesterday. tested more. such, likely find people it. saying, ""You miss 100% opportunities take?""

I isolation infected, need honest media reporting cases. Gross numbers easy look at, net positive negative day-to-day percentages ""tested vs. positive"" give much clearer picture.

There also multiple reports people tested getting something mail saying positive. know 2 cases, 1 TN somewhere US, someone scheduled test, missed it, never rescheduled, still received something mail saying ""You Covid.""

Regardless, something sketchy going on, government given adequate evidence believe telling truth. citizen, free make decisions, actively believing government's guidelines. bad good you. I'll respect ability make decisions &amp; respect mine. That's said. He's idiot COVID. agree that, I'm sure mad comment.  report Chinese government news sources front page right twice?

Do think happens magic? agree zero medical scientific qualifications. Generally speaking experiences closer Research/teaching hospitals big cities less nurses find support pseudoscience. Conversely, worked small rural hospitals far removed teaching hospitals found pseudoscience supported enough nurses doctors feel really safe going patient.  premise behind World War Z... never knew book corona.

Just cold, disinterested shame. thing makes pandemic uniquely difficult manage America one really “at-fault” direct sense - mad scientist created COVID released intention harming USA. culture America seems best single enemy unite against, cause pull fragmented political spectrum together. Without unifier, get current apathetic, disjointed response. bio-terror attack feel though would massively easier get widespread buy-ins wearing masks, locking down, etc patriotic thing do. Even though fact also absolutely true today (wearing mask help fellow citizen definition patriotism), without distinct ‘other’ rally against, big chunk population can’t understand abstract concept enemy, thus refuse participate.

Well, gotta make headline somehow. I'm sorry loss. can't imagine much hurting right now. think contacting article writers create memorial profile too. court case judge lawyer jurisdictional authority issue subpoena, delivered person front witness 

So either “journalist” lying changed word subpoena even though wasn’t subpoena. 

These facts know, I’m calling lies, defending lying good look legitimately terrible human argues bad faith. Fuck fishing pole. enough people feel way virus may always us people going co-exist it.

Also, I’m nurse professional contacts local children’s hospital. number kids hospitalized severe inflammatory responses related Covid scary high.  I’m nurse take many precautions work home thankful stay home spouse son.  Idiot. also group people yelled American Indians “go back came from” baffles me.

FOX NEWS Someone knows stuff correct I'm wrong amateur understanding, infected person needs significant viral load generate enough viruses body order spread disease. immune person, antibodies kill virus prevent building large quantities. means immune person unlikely spread virus via droplets aerosols (they could potentially still spread via surface transmission, could literally solid surface). 

I would still hesitant positive antibody test = immunity, test always reliable know sure much immunity antibodies confer SARS-CoV-2. also raised wages laborers. simultaneous bioterrorism attacks large cities combined mass drone attacks dropping payloads huge steam vents nuclear power plants cover night.

the country would busy dealing nuclear fallout, detect halt spread bioterror attack.

and since nuclear missiles ever launched attack, retaliation MAD averted.

afterwards, economy collapse become unable support military unable fund nuclear capabilities. flu, less ebola Mango?

People die things. news. alarming. People die. Healthcare providers die. 

As much hate hear 131 healthcare providers U.S died Covid-19 (according article). mean 729 healthcare providers died *during* Covid-19, 131 died *from* Covid-19. 700 died *during* Covid-19. terrible that? That's terrible.

It concept dating back Japan's imperial era denotes sense racial superiority cultural chauvinism. Mr Aso roundly condemned using it.

I mean, guess so? Japan far perfect society measure. I’m sure wearing masks helped 4% obesity rate (among ten lowest rates planet) might’ve played bigger role seems best. What's worldmeter?

Utterly insane tried charge. We're even first wave, yet. die ""fighting coronavirus"".

They sacrificed alter greed ineptitude.

Stop glorifying deaths... completely unnecessary entirely preventable, people positions power (politicians hospital administrators) valued lives less profit public image. I'm guessing typed buzzword, like general area live hotly contested viewpoints. fine. That's I'm upset. Parts world want hear happening. R0 thing dense environments quite high. Many instances 6+ per generation *far* more. That's way many people infected noticed. ""Yes, I'm looking Reddit."" trolling right? Here's ""Man, great cell. could make London skyline distance... think. Quarantine bangers mash could've better though."" NO. tetanus shot. lol real question anyone care question?

That's admission. exceptionally great shape since retired fighting, either. rolled dice virus came lucky.  brain actually retarded Education far biggest threat national security. low? Yes! People going ERs calling 911 heart attack stroke symptoms. could saved treated time, dying experiencing severe effects. Also, call 911, EMTs may available. EMTs typically work 2 rig taking patient hospital, stay patient safely handed nurse bed. nurses ER beds available, EMTs stay one patient maybe hours, even ER lobby.

Or maybe that's student loans? both? Well shut world two months yeah bet it’s nothing scoff at. Totally agree tbh. walked, ran, manual labor. Push ups, etc. probably much better shape are. Right, that's imagine quarantines working! New Zealand continue quarantine there's widely distributed vaccine.

It's opposite us states. We're starting cut rest world infection rate high. Phew, good thing live Asia. *we* enough senses read damn article. getting hand year. Last year none die fighting coronavirus! Someone showed nightmare fuel H5N1 day, better hope mutate going person person.

The new swine flu also legit nightmare fuel. Sorry, dude, busting rabbit Ebola, may well add rest. Crap, never thought way. sure downvoted, that's great way think Believe it, system costs add several dozen middle men women (insurance companies make part hospitals business two prices, one insurance one private out-of-pocket customers. hospital must hire whole army administrators deal everything patient coming patient leaving sending bills everybody. gigantic mess bunch soft costs useless jobs could cut making hospitals hospital things instead business things). Tbf beach one less risky things could doing. Cuomo make fuss, Trump DeSantis et cetera never framed state vs. state issue first place. They're getting taste medicine. states resources manpower spare, interest help. rise cases affects us. eating patio somehow considered reasonable? still maskless, likely without proper distancing, salivating hard due chewing also engaged social conversation. Hey forgot meds wish true unfortunately they, public health authorities, continue downplay even potential fecal-oral transmission despite evidence contrary. 🤦🏿 it? figure yet? 😁 hat's wise perspective. see coming...

I've weirdly seen asked much (admittedly I've taking break COVID news lately). Lag newer treatments + prepared hospitals + yet run capacity. Currently, cases occurring subset population less likely develop complications. hope death rate stays low. fear initial group. group might infect others higher risk complications. Therefore, deaths might lag even longer normally expected Sorry Yeah, almost definitely, sorry dude. then, think infections hospitalizations bad they'll probably reclose Tahoe.  Sheep context okay 700 people die? America’s healthcare system broken long time - it’s exclusive trump era. Smart! Yes, similar situation - ethnic group ends split different modern countries. rather common occurrence modern world. common reasons suspect overstay 90 day visa, try break conditions working etc. That's ask see itinerary check flight within time period. hope joke make fun buffoons think Bill Gates trying chip people. Thank medical system insurance companies pay Grand old party keep ripping people like us off. doomed country see change soon. like SA did. Coincidence? Oh clears it.

And yeah, plebs lol. can’t pay we’ll lock cage Well country advised people buy masks... Yeah probably, sorry dude. honestly think result infection/hospitalization spike weekend, Tahoe likely close. opened gyms bars way soon. Ideally pursued gradual easing lockdown gyms bars last reopen. Would prevented spike cases yes Wow! scary two reasons. One unabated spread leadership state. highly infectious nature virus, don’t see people ignoring guidelines ever allow ever die US. fear states strict border control them, beginning end “United” States America. Seriously? noticed heart attacks strokes AAAs arriving ER? People stop heart attacks, never got treated died home. Dubai looks EPIC thought going get haven't. city cancel event going watch fireworks vehicle. get butthurt piece shit. reason whole world working together vaccine still earliest predictions 2021.

Mmm... no. listen JRE dont buy onto anti mask stance. dis agree someones points still listening show. Unless sarcastic joke, ive duped respect opinion, would like evaluate/reasoning. I’ll honest, don’t really care U.K. whole way, live that’s rly lol Gotta admire entitlement Americans think have! 

You’re even country, least respect following rules! something something statistics something something pre existing I'm often disappointed restaurant fare, eaten one four months. see restaurant visits immediate future. state media controlled driven party politics, funded government finances monitored independent body ensure remain impartial report facts. there's debate contentious discussion they're mandated give sides debate equal attention. 

This negative effects extreme minority views given air time overwhelming majority issues overall think huge positive US model pretty much major networks heavily involved trying sway public opinion Country shitty government, one that? /s Dead serious. guys going winter comes? Hair dog bit ya everyone US either. get every single bit trump news. Basically I'm saying perfectly acceptable racist Asians suffer consequences. talking mirror right now? hospitals run space patients, see localized lockdowns occur again. deaths shoot back may see bigger lockdowns happen. shutdowns designed keep hospital systems overwhelmed (like Italy). successful, far, Northeast. areas risk. Overwhelmed health systems mean people dying way provide treatment—and would include people car accidents heart attacks. 
This idiot way much now—conflating public health economic health. Yes, hospitals losing tons money couldn’t things like profitable knee replacements people didn’t want schedule colonoscopies. 
That’s failing way US healthcare system structured. doesn’t mean lockdowns wrong. right here, numbers lie, people do. Reporting played &amp; state trying save much face possible could underreporting.

Vote, people. Fight families, country, yourselves. Title says numbers rose 11k. thought meant 20k one day. guess rising 11k correct think it. Yes am. also ready festivals. Massive dance parties. Sure!

Loads people ready. already danced people 3 days ago.

&amp;#x200B;

This virus dangerous. Netherlands restaurants bars full again. people ready think. 

&amp;#x200B;

The people subreddit mean. Everyone outside chilling living life here. could less staff due July 4th? Either way keeping numbers artificially low day two change anyones actions. quite clear past 2/3 weeks covid spreading like wildfire Perhaps avoided, stopped. Lol. People stupid. one counts. death certificates give primary contributing. ""The governor Michigan tyrant...because...well know why.""

My mom bitched Pelosi day. I'm fan Pelosi asked mom specifically Pelosi make like woman...go figure, reasons. Yep, protesting EJK masks exactly partying masks America sucks it’s laughable say U.K. way “much better”. truth go date.

Holy fuck, ignorant. Science changes fucking time new data collected. Unless we're talking scientific law, like Law Gravity, constant, unchanging ""truth"" science, medical otherwise. sounds awesome, found library. Thanks! Upstate you, curious? region people pretty well. sad 1) Apparently 3-4 week lag time deaths reporting US (completely fuckin insane) death numbers really whole ago. 2) lag time someone gets tested would eventually die around 3-5 weeks. 


So guess would expect surge deaths recent uptick positive cases early August math right. used years; new. large scientific market them. *not* happy pi- mean, Law Enforcement Officer, passed due virus. *not* happy members LAPD wearing masks. certainly *not* happy LAPD might begin outbreak within department. certainly *not* want see Law Enforcement Officers stop brutalizi- mean, keeping street safe dangerous criminals. wish cuomo here. Someone who, matter bad gets, tells us what's going virus it.


instead guy spends time telling us blown proportion hides real figures us. fucking sucks hard. do, smaller scale Mexico reports 624,987 tests total **245,251** positives according Worldometer.

What looks like pretty freaking bad testing capacity catch cases. country takes 15-30 days get results... that's even manage get tested love positive talk. disheartening see country move negative direction regard fighting virus. Please list actions state federal governments taking crisis ""get sooner better expected""? hopefully power magical thinking one items list. hope signs hope? data govt response give reason hopeful realist occurring front me. wish something would happen could make little optimistic. north Florida believe need prove family Texas. link show re: 5000 pneumonia vs 1800 normally. Let’s hope recovery time qualifies pole Calling. I'm working several health departments deployed support case investigation contact monitoring based outbreaks throughout state.

I always introduce calling behalf X Health department ask contact case confirm identifying info telling I'm calling. tell I'm calling voice messages HIPAA, say I'm whatever health department. also call person 2-3 times depending case contact. could bought one. argument *never* 45% people get covid vaccine. argument fewer 9 11 people don’t get flu vaccine get covid vaccine. Yea. Sad. good did, per parent family members told masks cause covid cases

Others need understand better, bad initial messaging reason disregard we've learned since. That's one example - look whole Europe - 

It's same. Daily cases increasing. Daily deaths decreasing. Ad hominems. Keep up. nothing better say. literally give two shits anyone else thinks me.

It's scary see truth world really like. get ready help fight also. ✊🏾✌🏻 rate maybe Florida swing state upcoming election... recall photo years ago recall anything ever said guy. worth noting Microsoft comfortable making statements like two reasons:

1. true.
2. poured millions failed social networking attempts. started sub remember lost covid. initially intended redditors personally dealing loss moment still mainly cases hit headlines. types posts welcome, still can't get hazard pay screwed Bernie hard. Twice. phone dad yesterday tried arguing study proved masks don’t work. Well starters trouble finding (gee maybe show masks work), sent via email hey guess what? study said masks effective, chose cling 1 sole point suggested droplets particles still make cloth masks aren’t n95. 

I also argue ask literally almost every single country managed get spread control 3months lockdown US things still worse ever. What’s difference? Masks. noooo started making reasons. Literally people go mental gymnastics justify wearing mask? Yeah ok it’s like “authoritative sources” lied masks beginning backtracked well asymptotic transmission among things. Maybe trustworthy people wouldn’t look information random people internet. Sorry lost credibility long time ago. Put owners behind bars ASAP 3rd degree murder one single person due idiocy dies.  Compared 99.8% seasonal flu median age gone slightly last week. [http://ww11.doh.state.fl.us/comm/\_partners/covid19\_report\_archive/state\_reports\_latest.pdf](http://ww11.doh.state.fl.us/comm/_partners/covid19_report_archive/state_reports_latest.pdf) Holy fuckin' shit. That's miles beyond gross, that's active health hazard fucking stupid boot! God, people. I'm sorry happened you. CDC saying wear mask longest time? facebook supposed advising better groups?  Barcelona really small city. That’s going happen we’ve spent month bashing cops around country calling defund police. activists wanted right? social workers go encourage people wear masks please thank you. Another possible reason: think confirmed case load percentage actual number cases. Towards beginning pandemic (call March), testing infrastructure much worse NYC time, virus likely propagated extensively undetected weeks (or months possibly) lockdown. set stage high death totals per confirmed case total due said extensive undetected propagation.

At point time, I'd like believe Florida catching higher percentage cases gap real-time disease propagation testing capability much smaller. would allow Florida's testing infrastructure sensitive. read totally wrong. thought saying people died stopped caring, thought pretty reasonable. re-read seems mean people know people died stopped caring. international travel still applies. LAX one busiest airport world. ride eternal, shiny chrome! Keep fighting good fight, 95% heroes. there's hope country, start good news like this. Waiting importance D614G around long time not. fact become dominant. Thus mutation, said, different one predominant March, so? 

It's mutation increases transduction multiple cell types recently think fully understood. understood scientists March stand corrected. list article I'll read edumacated.

I enjoy posts sub I'm quite sure pissed off. tone certainly authoritative. one authoritative uses words like 'lovely' 'spreadier' assert mastery topic. friendly tone which, alas, lies squashed dead beneath weight diatribe. 

Stay Safe. So... you’re saying it’s okay 700 brave people die?? think would great idea could get mask bars mask bars.

&amp;#x200B;

So everyone gets want. would never go bar would wear mask.

&amp;#x200B;

So create two versions, best worlds.

&amp;#x200B;

People choose want visit establishment demands customer wear one. many teachers die educating children? Especially this. surprising number comparisons drawn Fallout pre-war lore current events. Asian focused Racism, specifically aimed China/Communism (The ""Reds""), scarcity items like Toilet Paper compared use Caps currency, fact things like Atom Worshipping crazies Nuclear holocaust seem far fetched people denying science already refusing wear masks. easily replaced preppers? know, guys bunker backyard thousand rounds ammo, multiple guns types, rations 5 years, etc? Oh goodness! uneducated dumb country? Come people grow conscience protect neighbors. Stop faux patriotism BS propagated leaders really care you. Reality facts seem liberal bias. schools this. grew up: elementary middle. high school not. absolutely correct even politics, fandoms communities. per reddit rules downvote button serve disagree button, impossible enforce. bartender 2 decades bounced. No. It’s already stressful job. Don’t need add covid roulette it. I’m done forever. quit years ago literally anything else even meant pay cut. Selfless? mean job they're paid do.

Hundreds construction workers die accidents every year hail selfless people buildings.

But yes agree, mask homie. Yeah anarchy goal burn shit Lol people stupid it’s fucking numbers right forget shitty, selfish, leader Plus like they're getting paid. call selfless. think tech mogul would ability to, know, surveil anyone using Microsoft product connecting Azure services... know crazy thing is? small pull like speech. Seeing Mt. Rushmore powerful. see stupid face opens mouth snap back reality boosted numbers either. opening malls, hair salons, etc has, they're indoors. Less airflow.

... stop.

It takes 3 weeks see new cases. Saying ""Protests increase it"" protests(And reopenings etc) cases went nuts... 3 weeks protests reopenings still ongoing...

How make assumption protests nothing; outdoor transmission low? Stay safe avoid disease best  also shithead approach dealing ""far-left"" lambaste them. /s needed? Youd think govt would jumping possible solutions this. us couldnt obvious much latex nitrile feel like it’s thought though. Pandemics random usually big lapses times them. wouldn’t think pandemics con thinking becoming healthcare provider. criminal? saw that. live Pinellas 2 years now. hospital allergic reaction really hoping nothing bad happens requires need go next months. know coronaviruses.. short immunity times. get vaccine required yearly. hearing nurse friends/sources, hospital leadership/admins relying PPE supplies donations government - purchasing PPE costs affecting hospital’s bottom line. 😵 FWIW, seems colleges Massachusetts going follow similar plan. Allow students return campus, offer mix remote in-class learning. students want, stay home online entirely. specifics likely released later month, probably also restrictions international students since travel restrictions still exist imagine. even regarding people coming areas like TX FL seeing what's happening there. imaging insurance, many able afford medical care. Healthcare industry realize charging way much. noone able afford, Healthcare industry force cut prices risk going under. 

IMO, healthcare + insurance system broken beginning. die other.

FTFY good keep mind Canadian citizens one reason another American plates. also reports people valid reasons either American plates Canada harassed people making assumptions IIRC it’s slang term referring someone believes unsubstantiated pseudoscientific claims. backpacking around Europe 90s, Americans would put Canadian flags backpacks try pretend like American. states competition find out, we'll see results soon. someone lives Alabama, I'd say send help, Ivey accept it. saw news Hidalgo County Texas hospitals full moving patients counties make room. zero risks?

One would think masturbation would top spot. can't think activity would beat it. think reason Bill Gates pushing vaccine covid things ""go back normal"" philanthropic benevolent, naive child. Bill Gates's net worth *doubled* last decade ($50-100 billion) allegedly charity? 

It's crazy discuss connections
 Bill Melinda Gates Foundation vaccine producers (which second largest financiers of) dictate policy state funded vaccine projects. W.H.O, Dr. Fauci, others literally flip flopping dangers virus, masks, etc. Tell rational person cannot come think ""crazy ideas?"" takes one massive hurricane hit southwest summer. 

I genuinely don’t believe US equipped level social unrest barreling towards I've wondered well, areas flare-ups right also highly educated. California generally highly educated state. areas around research triangle park North Carolina super highly educated. I'm sure correlation is. really believe Northern Virginia, strict lockdown lengthy. Many us area either work federal government contractors federal government. also gave lot us ability work home majority federal government continues work home. think generally, lot less financial burden higher percentage population areas. crunched data, that's sense. Wow would like restraining order. It’s terrible. rare case. I’m surprised another celebrity hasn’t similar complications. hiding out? offer reasoning disagree back larger scale behavior across general population leading cause.

?? Yes. Thats actually exactly u/whereami1928 said.

I suspect ""data got"" actually true, perhaps even dangerously true. them? Fuck fake gods pray to, fuck consider feelings direct actions inactions killing people?!? 

I feel like feel spittle froth mouth. please explain angry? religious need die disease spread.

then logically speaking absolute win rationale over-the-top punctuation spamming smashing keyboard angry.

Or represent side extremist viewpoint. heaven great religious extremists diving face first vats covid. 

You win win...but reason everyone angry. Why? getting want getting want, right? everyone loses folks devolve mindless reactionary rage. may right side scientific argument that's pretty fucking useless fighting extremism extremism. 

Do care life? so, maybe reconsider position diseases judge, infect infect take take. Last time checked religious people occupy places non-religious. ignorance infuriating. Yes, yes is. wishing death definition cutting nose spite face rhetoric given circumstances. thought people would least try follow rules time around, especially considering surge cases.. 

But nope! get nothing. fact probably get another explosion cases next month. nearly 2 million people waiting adopt 250k adoptions per year. I’ve actually laughing everyone got mad reading comments. Literally every comment chain ultimately agreed you, initial stance disagreeing Sometimes people say they're driving Alaska, allowed, go hang Canada they're lying liars. I've read ton info, posts, etc. find super amusing. conspiracy theories. anyone actually fall stuff genuinely believe beyond me.

At end day, sadly, believe power human greed stupidity. What? Im saying inaccurate stuff favours hivemind gets upvoted. Anyway facts often bias attached not. prevelence media needing sensationalize everything order make money using clickbaity titles people take face value without reading content context actual story. becomes game telephone people spread manufactured disinformation ends straight dangerous ideas. 

Social media medium spread. Blaming social media like blaming cars boats drug trafficking. lot fewer tests available early days. 11,000 cases New York March 11,000 people seriously ill high risk group. fair, different Muslim countries suspicious non-Muslim vaccines. 

Fortunately, China already pledged share vaccines, Africa option. 

Plus, India says ready Aug 15. people resemblance brain cell head? questionable amount pneumonia deaths FL year. Still matching NY's numbers also widespread NYC getting hammered recently started spading 3 county south fl hotspot April. top comment. 

1184 number deaths flu pneumonia 2018.

6314 deaths flu pneumonia covid 2020, 1762 attributed covid. Obsequious, zombified degenerates, else? Bill Gates monster wife ought exterminated like pests are! joke!   Let's keep real severity pandemic get watered language. year, past months. That's terrify people.

The fact people still think wearing mask political opinion horrifying instead see pattern happen Europe

You see pattern happen Sweden

Thanks clarifying I've heard people say they're going Alaska, allowed requires drive part Canada, go somewhere Canada instead. lot will. hospitals lot places capacity 4th July, hospital staff starts die.... flip side, absolutely wait unified sounds REEE liberal cities Trump wins 2020.  still wants apology media. completely agree you. went cape area meet parents takeout. planted picnic table water nearest people maybe 100 yards away. way back home filling car gas watched 10 cars go dunkin drive through. 0 customers wearing mask.

I imagine opening gyms like going do. crazy coronavirus fake cover 5G towers killing us ""EMF"" Bill Gates trying ""profit"" micochipping everyone? /s hella medical debt hospitalized. subject article broke quarantine possibly exposed virus. clearly live college town. parties never stopped. Sure fewer since students left they've going strong lockdowns. homeschooled high school, went college, work full-time chemical engineer. assistance (even cheerleader!) let know!! this! easy choice many. least camps area held outside. going happen school supposed start? area considering hybrid every day in-person/online school, would mean 15 class everyone chose attend. parents shamed let kids go school 15 kids class? low risk activity yet jobs done bills paid, oh childcare found 3 days. disaster. might gone avid fan Laoway86 serpentza years That's restaurant problem, pretty prevalent throughout workforce. get tested Covid, although negative took week get results cleared return work. came back doctor's note immediately work ethic dedication company questioned. hours cut 34 hours week 16 week, would shocked I'm still employed month. Sadly, trending towards depression (if already there) easy employers act way line people looking work continuing grow. Get well soon friend! favorite place earth. hope god find way survive Dems literally encouraged people go chinatown eat.

What Trump saying response ""hoax?"" Whatever fuck means. Imagine alien species wanted take earth, would make sense. Inject virus populous place planet let people self destruct. Antibody tests rely immune system make antibodies first, process take couple weeks. 

So no, unfortunately solution trying detect early infections.  see 40-50 yr old caring quartining wearing masks ok, blame Chyna again.  Thank much. guys really encouraging. appreciate support. Phase 1 2 combined afaik, like Oxford vaccine. Lol I’m also isolating due reason needed humor Years* ago lol sloppy sloppy mess. look west texas area example, odessa (ector county) trauma center 17 counties. el paso nested its’ sister city Juarez home 1 million people. borderlands south (Rio Grande Valley) saturated hospitals, _spoiler alert_ tou probably would want go hospitails hospital matter even best times!... houston saturation week! ugly. five Auckland police officers need COVID tests? Would side effects rushed vaccine really worse disease itself? said dont know I'm talking do. really dont care. conclusions wrong. liked Bryan Callen MadTV. He's great Goldbergs. 100% increase, sound alert! placebo honestly safer mass distributing unproven vaccine. read paper distributing flu vaccine .00001% fatality rate would killed people flu itself. might factor 10 percentage, point remains.  want let know detected sarcasm. Everybody's gonna die, covid making die 1 100 years earlier. 

/s Darwinism finest mean yes? Lol surgical masks? scares death parents (in upper 60s) live southern Maine. Maine’s cases pretty low that’s tourists don’t count. Anyone contributed problem need punished there's major difference supposedly accidental mutation/lab accident blatant, willful ignorance.  article, say articles Indian government actively involved making happen.

So probably bluster going happen, likely scam. issue. issues nicotine thc vapes well. think actual heating elements something toxic them. make think they're going Canada.

You realize average 200 cases day Canada currently China shithole right? Serious question - changed mind? half way Walking Dead comics virus kicking it, felt bit relaxing. several cases singers get worse. seems deeper corona goes lungs, worse is. Shaddup, Fucktard. plain wrong. see negative pressure becoming requirement, there's danger humans implementing it. office runs negative pressure, would never even know save slight rush air open door. Negative pressure typically around tenth (or less) PSI. Truly awful. terrifying people working field. I'd guesstimate somewhere order 10,000. Mhmm, they've wanting reason harvest horseshoe crabs. Pharma wants blue blood money. Pricks. Ok, nice day. Buckle buckaroos actual cost shouldn’t anywhere near 800K. I’m Australia, quite comparable, it’s estimated ICU stay costs around $5000aud per patient per day 5 week stay would cost say $175,000 government. quick google says UK estimates (£2000, approx $4000aud). wear pants stuff want to, would rather wear mask cause I’m dumb think cloth mask gonna help get sick people live Miami summer beside Yeah, folks US need bring Medicare sooner rather later. billing overhead lack negotiating power drug companies going cause recreation debt prisons workhouses. 

You folks need Tommy Douglas. it’s going Bernie, maybe go talk Kiefer Sutherland entering politics; he’s Tommy Douglas’s grandson, he’s got little bit ancestral cachet might convince folksz Better alive debt dead, right? 16 million health care workers U.S., making almost 5% total U.S. population.

132,318 Americans died covid-19 far. health care workers make 5% population, would expect 6600 health care worker deaths. Accounting number old people, still 1500 health care worker deaths, assuming occupation gave additional risk all.

So, 700 healthcare worker deaths would mean health care worker safer jobs, regarding catching virus. Hardly, 1000$ fine nothing. full 10000 followed life time ban country. FUCK OFF. Something something tyranny something something

America’s handling virus absolutely abysmal. selfish culture things anything inconveniences fucking comparable Nazi occupied Germany. laughingstock world isn’t going get better anytime soon. Yup. Sorry didn’t know Latin word loudmouth. That's cute. I'm realistic. Show ""naive"" I'll prove wrong multiple sources. 

Stop promoting anti-science bullshit. much entitled piece shit complain people wearing masks. [It New Delhi /u/ExoBoots right. woman picture look healthy, anecdote withstanding. outdoors also large amount air virus dissipate well. agree outdoors much safer indoors, said.

However, mention tourists *inside shops.* beach area itself, sand/boardwalk, packed VB. That's one thing. indoor areas line beach concern me, bc tourists need eat shit entertained... air conditioned environment, bc beach hot. refuse wear masks even buy beer 7/11. selfish sad infuriating. No, fear mongering. one know permanent effects yet, virus us like 6 months. don’t data show it. might still recovering might still issues breathing, proof permanent issue, aside beliefs. Reread article...there one doctor scientist verifying condition permanent. There's lot events/issues last 5-10 years common sense rational response/opinion completely obvious me, yet would people certain ages, races, creeds, colors, associations would defy kind logic response/opinion.

I truly believe Coronavirus worst example yet many ways honestly wonder often I'm one crazy living Twilight Zone. Honestly surprised more. went buy groceries yesterday restaurants packed, one wearing masks felt like pandemic solved problem. 
Many places tiny people sitting close proximity. last month social distancing norms place starting July everything's window. Yeah closed “interstate highways” Moon Man still best beer. Spotted cow well known. Can't go wrong any. ~40 day timeline, I'd say even one three would optimistic Involuntary social isolation real, valid issue. I've going lost job end 2018, spent majority 2019 2020 healthy enough work stuck apartment myself, without human pet. COVID made everything worse regular social things eliminated.

I've fallen incredibly depressed health plummeted even past 5ish months. Hence: Stay fuck home wear fucking mask lives don’t mean thing don’t wear masks. willing personally willing test difference? There's need rude. oddy missed part: 


 health officials warned Americans prepare spread novel coronavirus U.S., **people shouldn’t wear face masks prevent spread infectious illness, according Centers Disease Control Prevention, U.S. Department Health Human Services U.S. surgeon general.**  


And fact **the U.S. surgeon general recently urged public to** [**“STOP BUYING MASKS!”** effective preventing general public catching #Coronavirus**  


As WHO, edited relevant info out, reason: CDC, World Health Organization people wear mask **only displaying symptoms coronavirus “taking care person suspected 2019-nCoV infection.”**  


So, like said, experts gave considered wrong advice while. cant expect Facebook experts. expert bodies probably consider reforms provide accurate info future. private tech firms really shouldnt required take responsibility providing medical advice readers, cause may get things wrong shoot fireworks hours night, setting largest ones 4 every night last month.. yeah, i'd help neighbor. probably. article seems imply overly large amount pneumonia deaths may covid-19 pneumonia year finalized won’t know witch one officially marked as. still points incredible increase pneumonia deaths far year caveat may end covid19 officially later date. would mean wanted hide covid19 deaths wold simply need mark deceased you’ve bought till end year held accountable fine you’re trying lie way election year. check voicemail unless number know lol There's lot events/issues last 5-10 years common sense rational response/opinion completely obvious me, yet would people certain ages, races, creeds, colors, associations would defy kind logic response/opinion.

I truly believe Coronavirus worst example yet many ways honestly wonder often I'm one crazy living Twilight Zone. course would say that. saw Facebook invented Corona! Nah man. UV Segments ionizers. Knock viruses right air already are. know nurse single mom walked March started. said justify risk kids. people want virus high IFR stay home playing video games forever. Going sports stadium 9, right religious services. need propaganda time. literally show article article fukt up. read quickly like, ""how would closing roads help Hawai'i""? naive. Oy- governor talking about. “tyranny” 🙄 Michigan high enough anymore screenshot CDC added. arse. “Let eat cake” probably placebo. India hope containment population lead expect otherwise, placebo need justify giving containment save economy. think downvoting instead replying. think people celebrating lower death counts realise current surge cases followed three weeks time surge deaths. think people celebrating far prematurely. What's e bike? LOL, definitely political stunt.  2 1 beach special USA USA USA USA Wife got drive-thru COVID tested CVS Minuteclinic 7 days ago still received results. said get results 2-4 days now, nothing. 4 year old son fever rashes 7 year old son rashes symptoms. Anyone else issues getting test results CVS Minuteclinic? wages garnished become even bigger burden society. Sounds like smart idea. think so. world vote elections. Gotta keep sweet. Thank gathering idiots one convenient place, good times await them... Virus doesnt care basic rules neither I. think complete idiot. here! totally recommend try pick copy Stephen Kings, “The Stand”. It’s fantastic right alley. I’m another read I’m really enjoying due Corona pandemic. Check summary promise you’ll really enjoy yourself. first generation kids, absolutely is. Losing year half education rest world moves massive American failure, can’t see contributes generational poverty income inequality, can’t help you. like leaving responsibility education companies hands paying off, weird right? probability, insurance companies go bust.

Which mean get bailed out.

Which prime time government flat buy them.

Then combined rebranded. really hate say it, feels like they’ve died nothing. COVID cases increasing States, yet people getting less less responsible fucking dipshit president making health safety partisan issue.

These 700 men women sacrificed lives bunch ungrateful brats think wearing mask infringement rights.

Fuck country. Yeah....You’re making things Second bottom, Roger Liddell. Great man, friendly everyone ever met. miss McLaren Flint. many research papers published Cell, world’s top bioscience journal? 

So you’re saying researchers Los Alamos lab UK teamed German news organisation distort science order support preferred narrative Trump Texas governor? 

Really? 

Surely would productive directly criticise research paper scrutinising data findings, rather throwing highly unlikely conspiracy theory. say aerosol mean droplets, correct? Aerosol defined particles smaller certain size, easily pass non-N95 masks coverings, bypass filtration ability upper respiratory tract go deep lungs, specifically prime location particular virus take hold. article says seals. wouldn’t surprised “doctor lying something else need higher Covid numbers blaming that”... I’m
Sure like fiancée got it, mistress. hurting fb lol bet they'll make big changes bring advertisers back. Money rules lol even pillow guy. Yeah I’ve heard people flu shots effect. However case, auto immune disease nurse working rheumatology department. get sick really easily auto immune disease that’s surprised seemed especially department works in. She’s entitled opinion thought interesting that’s first time I’ve ever heard nurse vocally it.  hear that. yeah, prices things go send $1200 ""free money"" everybody, 1/4 country unemployed makes employed get extra $600 week ""free money"" would normally get. America, entirely fault. failed respect essential workers they're dead. blood hands. Side note think full name, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, gorgeous. don’t know exactly works well. Opening schools sending kids school 9 scale then. Science education give tools think critically. Doesn’t mean everyone who’s educated uses them. Plus mist sprayers line, keep people cool. probably make maks soggy useless. talking exactly? exactly “wall street” scenario? safety it’s people’s safety! take people get this?

We want get that. 

Them getting exact reason lot people stopped wearing masks. 

""I'm supposed wear mask *might* hurt somebody I'll never know?""

I'm saying agree mentality, I'm far it. Although, uni student know people thinking way. Especially ones stuck living dorms give single shit cause ""I give parents I'm anyway"".

Dunno get across, argument working good chunk people. Well played Yo fuck frontline worker right now. hero stuff laughable. Finished pharmacy residency realize could've made money via unemployment instead exposing covid hospital. also could've time get groceries sigh  mandatory airport make travelers countries masks recommended normal feel comfortable

It's mandatory Danish health officials recommended wear mask situation likely come close contact public. also recommended wear public transit working closely clients, like hair dresser mention masks Sundhedstyrensens website still

Do know found information? Right link sent! Maybe missed I'm guessing actually speak Danish used clunky translator. spend time website, gives lots recommendations, tells use mask properly. links helpful graphic explains properly use dispose mask.

I know tempting sometimes see person goes grain, Michael Osterholm guy fringe expert. He's seemingly using help publicity numbers. sadly, seems working. Nice edit above, work harder following basic rules sub comments, please.  herd immunity threshold may differ place place, depending factors like density social interaction, said. But, average, experts say require least 60 percent immunity population. disease spreads easily currently believed, number could higher. lot variation people’s likelihood becoming infected exposed, could push number down. careful extrapolating mentioned. I'm absolutely criminal civil charges Warmer, Warmer, Warmer, Warmer, Warmer - Anyone uses US. Yeah that’s true. That’s death rate confirmed cases, recently, included severe cases people could get symptoms.

(This ] good, thinks 20,000,000 infections thus far.

Not saying virus isn’t dangerous, that’s death rate works. Well since deleted post can't really get detail. remember claimed CDC made one isolated statement masks February recommended shortly thereafter. remember WHO, CDC, surgeon general essentially mocking notion wearing mask. flip flopped early April. 

I'm wearing mask every time encounter another human, leaders screwed squandered credibility. wish screwed up, did. honor properly? think monument would nice see comment alot I've yet see one person disagree it, dont either.

So what's hold up? Could gain lot voters trump took seriously proposed solution even plan. facing criminal charges. isn’t he? people still keep talking worse flu, amazing delusional become keep certain version reality place. like lose rose tinted glasses able recover someone lives Vancouver, BC, freaked little. 18 cases one location would spike couple weeks around 10 day.

Shoutout Vancouver, WA. I've often stopped way Portland ""repairing homes elderly"" thing back high school I've got soft spot namesake city south. hivemind sees problem here. Thousands dollars medical debt, also trouble catching breath ask someone take hospital. nightmare. Nobody wants experience something like that, ever. Iran pretty serious outbreak early on.

so course Trump banned kinds travel anyone ever Iran time people coming back plane load Milan without checks whatsoever. Try reddit's bodyweightfitness starter. walls Hell yes! constitutional rights.....these people entitled, selfish, lethal. idea US constitution stands for. patriots. anything care themselves. greater good. together.

Gnosticism drug. believe special. know everyone else. receivers special information. know better experts. educated. intelligent. prefer follow cult. death cult. cult personality. hate U.S. right now. real tragedy this. Everyone everything possible ease burden health care workers also save lives. people utmost respect normal circumstances current situation goes beyond us would signed for. 

I’m sorry loss. Maryland mask wearing pretty much 100% Baltimore area. numbers Northeast US , bore brunt early epidemic flat weeks governors taking slow. Sadly, Sunbelt states giving Brazil run money. Sweden: ""Oh... Oh well! Lessons learned!""
 
 
Over 5000 dead... wonder many would still alive. see it....you well truly fucked chose apathy. Lol want rag States much national holiday. Happy 4th July. would great, IMO romanticizes truth.

Americans likely follow herd anybody else. folks adamantly refuse wear masks individualist cowboys, they're sort get information megachurch pastors, snake-oil salesmen, bankrupt businessmen. type believe someone barely passed high school immunologist headed NIAID 36 years.

Americans wearing masks they're scientifically illiterate easily manipulated. smoking crack think 40% due protests. evidence suspicion? 

The map protest locations line new outbreaks. 400,000 known cases COVID 19 NY, state almost 20 million residents. hard believe immunity big impact, protesters wore masks basically everywhere U.S. Lol fuck good thing Trump literally fighting roll back obamacare speak! /r/DataIsHorrifying Serious account OP? I've see bunch sub exclusively spam articles minorities suffering covid. Never sort discussion. article article topic. okay? Dr. Christopher Duntsch, right TX probability, insurance companies go bust.

Which mean get bailed out.

Which prime time government flat buy them.

Then combined rebranded.

Since USA, can't call Medicare, something like totally-not -socialism-care would probably work. No. satire? Even single one shocking large percentage, ask me. live west chicago, i'm 59, doctor taking vitamin supplements years. thankfully, apparently. catch him. San Francisco Mission District.  pretty serious someone home 

Caesar Pena one RAVAGED Italy?

By ""ravaged"" mean 6 deaths per 10,000 people. haven't. That's point. magically got it? Literally front page story LA times truck driver going outside bbq dying Covid. One person went knowing infected 11 people total. It’s fairly evident all. still contract way. Great least believe wearing mask , cool . Regardless blame game pursue criminal charges him. virus joke. There’s telling many people infected. Moron. lack respect other...

I know late respond, Bay Area, 'most' people themselves..

Had two dogs leashes walk one poop. responsible dog owners, trying pick couple, fully unmasked dog leash approached us.

Our dogs good, huskies, keep leashed (as ALSO law here). rush go across street. 

We let couple lack masks dog without leash. worried dog, worried 1) asshats wearing masks, 2) dogs would react unleashed dog coming us suddenly.

They like, ""Take court. dog well trained yours..."" care. fact is, know someone else's dog aggressive care dog. Also, mask requirement went across street fine, made attempt worry safety. Great may virus, know (or previously) it.

So sick people right now..

Fuck got really sick back January. flu shot, think common flu. sick 2 weeks, somewhat better 1 really sick another 2 weeks.


Should get tested? would that? called nurse line said really interested testing steering away idea.

I guess matter, would like know ? ThEy'Re HerOeS work bunch people live Michigan. love shit governor power hungry tyrannical. One called queen. they've said done is.. Try keep safe stay home orders, etc.

As soon pressed one actual issues doing, got ""agree disagree"" moved on. Though good bit less respect her. Love it. 

I'm totally imagining things now, I'd love teenagers downvotes here. Context important, right.

So let’s put numbers point understand wrong compare lives lives right now.

Medical training costly time money. New doctors nurses cheap either resource replace.

Medical experience even costly resource. lot people died 10 years experience each.

There gap good quality medical care many years come due virus. likely medical professionals become overworked expanded duties co workers incapacitated, quit die.

This knock effect actually matters jobs.

That context here. shit like China get straight jail name remembered whole country moron spread virus. Meanwhile America subpoena partygoers refuse cooperate tracing effort lmao. reason people get upset someone tells they're vegan, smoke. implication lifestyle choice might wrong; basically what's [this Amazon Prime, producers WestWorld.

Hi, I’m scientist (in viral immunology). data HCQ looks like shit reason it’s still getting media attention subset people bizarrely fixated it. article saw morning retrospective study (which less rigorous HCQ clinical trials canceled left right lack efficacy). 

There many antivirals could testing. need let HCQ go. felt March April living NJ. we’re way densely populated. Know 3 people flown Florida last weeks vacation too. Best luck there. Yeah used paying $1000 cloth sling 10 minute trip ER. means nothing them.

But prediction future. Oh princess internet joke ill wishes upon people Part oath harm.
You something may worsen status quo.
Besides, surgeons want minimize exposure risks too. Thank you. Hope humid there. Honestly point I'm surprised scientists start saying virus came meteor killed dinosaurs. ""*Ones falsley charged SURE let out*""

do suppose list people file cabinet somewhere..? so- first place..? I'm op, believe likely understand referencing Simpsons /s mean? saying it’s nearly 6 weeks since mass protests began death numbers STILL going every week, point 10% peak. don’t even watch Fox, watch numbers 🤷‍♂️  speak Danish. lived Denmark longer lived US. number under? mad lads! China, external import cases really much concern.

Because people entering mainland China subject mandatory quarantine 14 days, basically allows latent cases develop treated.

All seven cases asymptomatic infections imported outside country

The concern still 2 indigenous cases (presumably quarantine site) hopefully spread cases contained soon possible.  No, died dem libs giving lives China assassinated make look like corona killed them. Wake sheeple! /s *weird*, callous thing lie about. Like personality disorder weird. 

Are ok? 61k 60k no? Yes old boy. nanny use Range Rover take kids socially distanced hike something look know structural racism is. embedded society among white majority types racism allowed not.

For eg. sub like asiansexslaves survive must deemed fantasy I'd imagine equivalent sub blacksexslaves would immediately banned. must never looked bar graph see weekly trend reporting since March. High Friday, low Sunday/Monday, dips holidays. take days off, matter what.  Holy shit know *exactly* type person, captured perfectly. used wear mask, goggles, gown, face shield 12 hour shifts dental hygiene work. covid. torture. People need grow up. don’t get controversial issue sub.

Yes, protests righteous cause. may well understandable reason mass gatherings year. 

Yes, many wore masks protests well. 

Did really think cases would pop though? Social distancing window, police firing tear gas regular made people remove masks cough, virus doesn’t give shit you’re gathering large groups. It’s going take advantage wherever whenever can, protests exception that. course cases going spring Shaub either Rogan's podcast back April telling (probably fake) story mask totally punked cop tried give ticket it. thought badass cool. I'm gonna wish death him, hope thing hits hard enough teach lesson. Another problem lot people know condition could worsen outcome. $1000 fine nearly enough. Putting travelers forced quarantine expense two weeks bare minimum. I'm trying minimize it. think people stupid fuck.

I'm trying say limited energy, anger, activism feel like waste time spend time trying combat stupidity. focus energy combatting maliciousness.

My point need take deep breath realize stupid people always exist. they'll always dumb shit. 

The government really telling people wear mask. least dumb people.

The dumb people get news mass media stories mask infringement freedom. able work slave wage job infringement freedom.

Focus anger energy useful. Stupid people victims stupidity.

""Never argue fool, onlookers may able tell difference""  DEFINITELY can’t believe it, dude. live area always kind crazy, I’m talking decent town level displays city. Every direction. night swimming say enjoyable fourth ever right one way, spend entirety shift patients. problem pharmacy profession (at least hospital pharmacy) one knows do. Many hospitals performing discharge counseling (counsel meds leave with) patients come leave hospital medication reconciliations (we check see meds take home taken admitted appropriate). places differently, interact patients medical team takes care since worked academic institution. medical contact everyone. much still come physical contact. Plus round interns attending well. yeah whatever. sucks recognized. China showed us shut virus lockdowns alone. US stands unique vulnerability. tough ask. no, can’t use Google find easily verifiable fact. search isn’t even difficult. 

I don’t really care cite anything random people internet. either look yourself, don’t. thread reminds story Indonesian election last 500 election workers died course process. Sounds horrible, right? Now, ask question: “In context okay 500 people die?” Except turns 7 million election workers, large number going die time frame, election election. death rate line general death rate Indonesian population. 

Asking “is okay died?” loaded question completely missing point. Now, saying health workers fighting COVID-19 would died anyway anything like that. Obviously, many tragically passed away due virus. commenter attacked asking specifics statistics, stupid way. mean, 100,000 people around world die every single day—“aRe sAyInG iT’s oKaY DiEd??” “Okay” nothing it. flu shot 100% effective. could well still gotten it, something else entirely. US unlikely COVID-19 early.

You get antibody test. Google find places offer it. Note less reliable tests high chance false positive. Shits rough man. worked COVID ICU March-July NYC. Make sure support shit her. ICU nurses tough amount death seeing single week insane. Incorrect. [**Everyone living outside Africa today small amount Neanderthal them, carried living relic ancient debating whether saying true. pointing nowhere mentioned variant less deadly ""less-infectious"" variant.

It would ideal ends case, currently data supports fauci cya

I know means. Yup see video people fighting case wear mask like wearing mask jesus...How could wear bible then... Here’s riddle. 
1) .15 x 7.3 billion?

2) .15 x 730 million 

3) .15 x 73 million?

4) based questions 1-3, .15? reminded Chris Cuomo went bike ride illness can't give upvote, think I'm upvoting healthcare workers died. I'm upvoting deaths. I... Wish die all. to: duedilligance, treat patients... Go jobs. did. helped countless people. sadly, lost lives. tip Timmy's cup. everyone sacrificed much greater good.

Yeah, nutjob. love see sources.
seeing 3 county overwhelm right state. locking Barcelona, locking county relatively far away. dangerous

Is enjoyable ignorant? mask needs charcoal filters organic odor protection. shockingly large percentage nurses woo anti-vaxxer bullshit.

Why hospitals hire them? Chicago residents? 

Chicago 2.7 million people. burbs almost 7 million. local flyers O'Haire Midway even living city (Chicago). 

Seems toothless.  rly hard say? Rly?

It must suck help combat spread COVID front lines leave family legacy debt. Bro forget China - get tagged dragged Italy. would able live neighborhood. Here’s background: mean seriously. Look comment originally tell incorrect controversial it. sub really needs reality check. needs higher. 6 friends work bar industry tell last weekend tested positive antibodies recently, none able get tested COVID sick back Feb/Mar. pay $42k

I'm sorry part sentence. absolutely incorrect. Pull data anywhere see lows week Sunday/Monday highs almost always Friday. exception week Thursday like Friday. NEXT FRIDAY EZ-PZ HIT 60K. BOOK IT. get downvoted ton coronavirus andy's like call blatant disregard facts. Indeed 2.5 months.

They probably go local place pick groceries. Putting ""truth"" name publication honest putting ""democratic"" name country. RIP furnaces DX units. One simply add HEPA filters.

so know easy virus spread.

on top that.

idk cleaning got lazy ton places. fun call Levitt Nobel Prize winner he's epidemiologist virologist. He's biochemist. 

But better trust Bill Gates, fucking software engineer right? Herp derp. conservatives ones usually yell ""Don't trust government!"" constantly ramble government lying? also need emergency use authorization FDA probably take several weeks minimum. something similar hydroxychloroquine, people already sick hospitals. hurdle higher you’re giving something healthy people. information Oh hey, guess what. answered question. Even somehow imagine know every single medical scientific based establishment country, would YELL SOMEONE ELSE following recommendations? ""it's flu bro"" explain need someone else's face. Try again. overwhelmed though? They're perfectly fine hospitals expanded ICU compensate increased cases yet circle-jerking place masks virtue signal. people typically can't afford fly state. [Thank guys keeping pandemic prepared this. Ladder climbing forced move cities every 2-3 years. Yeah went out, quite honestly clubbing thing kinds social interaction happen infrequently. survive extrovert, learn make relationships work mostly long distance. also made home comfortable honest that's socializing build friend circle area. home prison. castle.

Voting hard country person color. Sadly one people ""get's it"". Moves tourist town bitches tourists. stfu awful thing.

All see locally posts bullshit is, wheres big party at, memes mocking safety. hard see breaks well next weeks. 

I guess we're getting heard immunity hard way, quickest possible manner. 

Yahoo. People wear masks also much less likely get virus. Can't spread it. quantity amateur fireworks neighborhood beyond anything I've ever seen. guess official fireworks cancelled, wife also said selling fireworks super cheap year.

I feel bad hospitals... uptick hold beer firework injuries. cRiSiS aCtOrS

Trolling aside, may patriots rest paradise. I’m teacher terrifies me. Lol, whiny redhatters always think someone owes source response?  
  
You bad faith fucks fuck off. one owes anything. fucking shit. known months everyone WHO. 

The World Health Organization shit. shit day one pandemic. Literally even worth paying attention to. ruining narrative. get covid, life ruined forever guaranteed. Fall line. number cases significantly.

The number severe cases/deaths still low.

|Country|Deaths/Million people|
|:-|:-|
|Israel |36|
|UK|651|
|Spain |607 |
|Italy |576 |
|France|458|
|USA |400 |
|Brazil |303 |
|Mexico|235|
|Canada |230 Tell people look risk underlying condition already 😂 probably healthiest looking 6 could find.. start thinking zombie movies fans may actually last longer us zombie apocalypse. autoimmune rheumatic disease might susceptible COVID-19 infection general population. think got mega dose reality fan plastered shit beginning here. Things REALLY bad shut completely. point I'm you. I'm wary anything that's completely safe looking, even really is. 

One would think states would observed happening got act together day. tho

""Tho"" word, asshole. Yeah I'm taking vaccine Bill, experimental, untested rushed vaccine need it. I'm done taking vaccines diseases I'm risk contracting dying protect 0.26%. get it, shelter place, wear mask. Fuck Bill I’ve seen around area it’s mostly millennials, young parent age now. Seems 49’s 50’s take seriously it’s back caring 60. Didn’t make damn sense me. right wing media absolutely empty prisons non violent offenders serious. Yea empty prisons, possible thing could hand guy re-election Rest world proves wrong. hope get well soon. cautious many people report starting feel better going downhill days later. Yep. Like telling firefighter protection get fighting raging fire $1 emergency blanket adding insult injury: “You signed this” good sells HVAC equipment. Sorry everyone else. least get keep job. Keep heightened regulations coming buddy! don’t deny that. believe still worth going great lengths for. Back March experts told us preventing 100% infection. inevitable. sentiment comments entirely illogical. GYMS RIP all. sacrifices lost us. absolutely empty prisons non violent offenders serious. Yea empty prisons, possible thing could hand guy re-election employer find reason let go employee. order things boil put oven disinfect home. Pizza lasagna ideal. population actually like 360 mil. current death rates significantly affected states 5-10%. yes, got ""bored"" locking down, anymore. it'll reinstated late all... magical land many maroons earned this. aerosolizes, similar, quite same. kidding, that's truly unethical even volunteers, also unnecessary virus already running rampant big part world released intent open person August 5th I'm trying explore options that's thing offering. Thank hope change heart soon. dunno doctors lying, would complete total idiot believe large percentage Covid deaths would died anyway.

Have wondered heart attacks strokes almost non-existant year? two major causes death year vanished. you’re right. fact vilifying language like used really contributes increasing hostilities people. Thats responsible. Nice. keeping closed fact well? know, ""citizens"" enter US illegally. Ruins people legitimately. get sick need emergency care take granted go ER nurse doctor care you. Nurses doctors always provide excellent care yet always provided necessary PPE. seen soldiers battle without state art weapons gear yet healthcare workers healthcare workers paid ultimate price serving community. honor stay home wear mask part. let deaths vain. opened mind late. says disagrees narrative? obviously fake news website feel ashamed posting it. probably bad headlines reddit make sound. 

No matter live going stereotypes make others wonder want live there. Ahaha weird year, people asking knew hanging Chad was, like 10 years old. feel like Charlie's angels craze. shit I'm sure teens nothing else hang beach blatantly joke get Bill Burr pro-macho meathead style satire snap show. Talk misinformation. Yes plz Yes, is. Shocking near large percentage. need let HQC go

Me? literally first time I’ve ever even commented required pay bond cross Canada, refunded cross Alaska, get within set time. Vice versa returning. Apparently, people gotten infected eyes.

Regardless, cloth mask 15% effective, that's still better nothing. surprising, always shortage nurses many places without stable employment base beats working WalMart. achieved wanted -- remove morons want travel unnecessarily think safe pandemic much work them. I'd love go quarantine couple weeks Auckland, order Burger Fuel watch Shortland Street problem beat it, many believe antibodies (whether correctly incorrectly) give resistance immunity. people seen dangers aren’t worried more, don’t care humanity selfish. Also generally liberal/progressive. Definitely correlation. 

I’ve parts VA outside NoVA mask wearing definitely common. Trump yard signs definitely are. also lots nurses old, co mobilities work (worked) live music. Texas banned things, shows since May. Also, Texas hasn’t really banned things cause know someone playing show today. Thanks explaining thanks service. Haha. Bill, that’s rich coming big blowhard. fucking mention Bill Gates? heroes. RIP heroes. hell people enough courtesy follow guidelines. sarcasm deserve life. Look Karen left mask. also guy blue shirt “Walmart nose sticking out” mask wearing. limit travel states. It’s like everybody means buy plane ticket fly another state likely 14 day quarantine place. unable buy plane ticket back 14 days up. 

It’s going happens. states second lockdown. Nobody wears mask toronto. honestly don’t care anymore, people don’t want protected COVID that’s people cruise ship continue get sick even 14 days quarantine rooms? airborne thing think transmitted daily food deliveries although allegedly transmitted easily surfaces. either airborne transmitted easily surfaces. According 2018 16,866,020. 700 would .004% healthcare industry workers. 

&amp;nbsp;

One healthcare worker dead every 4,129 covid infections every 188 deaths. five day since pandemic began. 

&amp;nbsp;

Another way quantify deaths immediate connections. Given average gender splits family makeup US would be:

&amp;nbsp;

525 daughters
175 sons
451 mothers
106 fathers
600 siblings
_____________
1857 people lost someone close them

&amp;nbsp;

Not mention communities, workplaces, 3000 years combined education. 
There’s lots ways calculate it!  That's kind Western POV. China figured January. Multiple calls public health, usually unannounced check-up RCMP local police department. 

Only Candian Citizens, permanent residents, immediate family essential workers allowed quarantine 14 days. 

No tourists leisure travel allowed. Unless say going Alaska that's loophole right now. Bet won’t talking point next drump rally.   Ah right. Totally forgot COVID skips business travellers. Duh. Rip try hold hope one person may read actually it. one person told many times one point breaks through. try test knowledge pick Night realize incredibly insensitive compare something atrocious Holocaust putting piece cloth mouth. don’t know entered province. could’ve already there. do, fellow kid number might actually become higher get closer worthwhile testing volume. course that's something never happen.

Universal testing could bring light infected know get isolated limit number people go infect. Countries deploy universal testing infection zones tend high rates success slowing spread suppressing it. yet, exactly China built Wuhan? Negative pressure hospitals specifically treatment? Georgia. need find deadline I'd like wait last possible moment pull plug. I'm hoping offer eLearning whoever though stay enrolled hopefully lose gifted classes safe go back. attending church service school? Well states United States run 3 think would constitue small? Fl, Utah, Idaho. Maybe that's small sample. Aren’t 23 cases 9 housing towers? aren’t locking remaining places cases? America dismantling Good see hospitals lowering prices covid. know, wonder many Americans don’t trust institutional establishments... wow, answer mystery evades me... puzzling... hear Chad hangs well people hate much hangs. right tho. SUPER religious fundamentalist uncle. holy fuck man swear hear stories like this, feel like folks dragging admins buildings whipping backs hamburger. wish safe way use nebulizer things go bad. credit, could probably spin good story media nurse evicted pandemic think she’s COVID risk. I've seen people shaming others seeing parents letting kids go safe playdates socialization that's people household. reality everyone lives loved ones need factor mitigation responses. cutting parties large gatherings cuts lot spread without asking people become hermits. Fucking THANK YOU. 100 comments dancing around bullshit first get right. I'm gonna go bitch full shit Oooh, finish word off, fragile white redditor! know it! Fuck off. Lol Murica days, people celebrate Mexico, country want build wall away from? Makes sense.

Also, considering cluster fuck US, Mexico fighting rona? heard thing. news US Brazil fuckin up.  Social media, people never heard get worldwide soapbox, misinformation hatred rise top. made internet unbearable. survival rate extremely high, like 98%. lot right-wing folks Facebook touting reason masks taking freedoms away (or something like that)

The downside chances surviving disease sustaining permanent damage lungs, heart, bloodstream exceptionally high. Personally, number cases concerns much. Exactly! Also take amount time reach number. Probably Mexico end among highest world, per total population may different. heck happened 2018?! one trusting Bill gates. We're trusting bank account essentially limitless he's sparing expense funding. silly little mind, Bill gates running lab tests playing microscopes? maybe hires/works experts fields writes check. two options seem likely? Black fragility begins letter N. Right! left right end February, aside rumblings China newshounds hearing, world totally normal. Fart around river weeks, head back car boom! Borders closed, lockdown orders, whole shebang. dead?  people enjoy freedoms every day? lose border closed non essential travel June 24, crossed. wonder crossed , to. Since wearing mask co-opted political statement, people think forced wear one violates freedom speech/expression.
Because apparently right inconvenienced trumps service workers' rights safe work environment least marginally tries protect catching Covid. antibody tests? say Americans necessarily slow learners. USA big misinformation/conspiracy problem since 2016. problem Americans look data countries, look horrifying amount skepticism.

What Bill Gates said day correlation US social media promoting COVID-19 conspiracy theories rise US cases completely correct. We've made public health issue political issue thanks right wing conspiracies. Also, issue become difficult solve thanks conspiracy; lump gun control issues too.

With hot dog competition, pretty niche Independence Day tradition, least put plexiglass competitors crowd... That's pretty good actually. 43 years old. reinforces belief many people stop developing mentally high school. Going strong since 911. One man's hill Florida-man's mountain. This. people understand insurance works. Excellent quip Worry not, dictators usual job fine /s

Recently president Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, ordered arrest almost opponents upcoming presidential elections, claiming ""will never allow bandits take country"". Many people protesting streets, almost like BLM protests 2.0 terms quickly everyone forgotten Coronavirus threat. Thailand actually similar idea. making travelers pay bond entering country. supposed cover funeral costs also things. Helping others? American value? Must new one... Wow. That’s extremely unprofessional say least. Horrible.
I’ve sick 50 days tomorrow. symptoms gone, flare up, cough fatigue, it’s nervous system stuff that’s scaring me. I’m heart palpitations on, high blood pressure erratic heat rates. One day I’m fine, exercise two days, comes back. insides feel weird, like vibrating something. skin gets cold prickles too.
I’m normally active, athletic rock climbing. It’s really messing life up. 
They sending heart monitor palpitations, I’m afraid what’s wrong won’t found. two ekgs. 
I also blurry vision. 
I get brain stuff, lot neurological symptoms. I’ve many weird symptoms... loss taste smell first tho. crazy stuff it’s different many people.
I sure hope get good care don’t lasting problems!! never quite going eat -our area shut like rest world !! Also less issues world !! Yeah, great idea, let’s deify guy literally pays millions conflict-of-interest money get public adore him. /s

What actual shit like thoroughly brainwashed?

Like, appreciate notion ignorance significantly blissful bear emotional burden glaringly obvious reality, holy fuck comment make cringe 🤢🤮 Smith's hot dogs top notch, em area recommend ball park they're pretty good too. bothers job. Taking people's pictures part customer transaction. maybe thirty seconds take mask breathe office air. We're six feet apart wipe everything customer know there's way I'm sanitizing every drop they've breathed small office space. Every time someone coughs office, even little cough, worry one that's gonna make unemployed, among things. Woah! even realize AUGUST month away. NYC never ""thousands"" deaths day. New York STATE's peak WHOLE 800 day. state averaging 10 deaths day. Texas, like Florida, appears shitty reporting deaths 0 consistency them. Though large number, cases going inevitably cause deaths go unless literally go ""at risk people getting sick"" ""no risk people getting sick."" tough enough wear mask, tough enough go hospital.

53,000 hours / 40 hours (average work week) = 1,325 weeks labor

1,325 weeks / 52 weeks (total weeks year) = 25.48 years labor *

If made federal minimum wage $7.25/hr would take roughly **52.7 years** pay $795k: 

*$795,000 / $7.25 = 109,655 hours work 

109,655 hours / 40 hours (average work week) = 2,741 weeks labor 

2,741 weeks / 52 weeks (total weeks year) = 52.72 years labor* 

Both quick calculations factor interest, life expenses like rent, groceries, etc. Even assume best case scenario interest free loan, able devote 100% earnings debt payment, it’s still insurmountable cost vast majority people pay off. can’t build “nest egg” “safety net” this. system completely broken. means wear fucking mask Maybe literally running people infect.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* That's call one rent-a-cop places ask two biggest guy find come help enforce mask policy. People need stop freaking outdoor crowds. places far robust contact tracing US, learned even individual transmissions incredibly rare outdoors, never mind kind [sizable needed grow epidemic.

It's prolonged, unmasked indoor gatherings expand pandemic. news needs show shame unmasked people following locations instead:

* Bars (which supposed closed NC, although nightclubs

* Churches (which particularly prone break mitigation requirements, distancing masking, even countries people much compliant)

* Prisons detention centers

* Warehouses, factories, call centers meatpacking plants feeling putting masks sake everytime came near. wait two weeks

this going like late March wirh death toll...

Nice job Neighbors! industry have? leaving Beijing go back home cities towns. lets narcissists make Canada shall we? link meant “scare” anyone. reader’s response individual. nice day! Yes, liked article.

Can provide source that? know want find prevent reinfection, think matters much controlling virus outside place origin.

I could easily wrong though. I'm asking sources prove wrong, genuinely love learning. Brilliant counter California Governor Newsom refuses actually enforce mask requirements. whole spiel right ‘educating public’ going well, see. mean? Would mind explaining? Bible belt light world per usual. Oddly enough, would ideal go back work. already virus, can't get sick (in theory, ""reinfected"" people turned false positives). get wanting work scummy boss willing risk customers lives profit. you’re implying didn’t read article did. don’t fully understand hence asking question. sucks. I’ve everything stay quarantined there’s many idiots here. Fauci's response: *Goddamnit. Fucking fuck fuck!* exactly right now, people work insurance. insurance companies want foot bill thousands people month long stays overpriced hospitals. Hi neighbor! cities cases multiplied 10 past weeks, still nearly bad FL. I'm sure city would go lockdown mode. Good top it. black death best lower class survived, wages grew 4x land available due massive population loss. article isnt wrong though, talk increase wages lower class transferred upper class spending. part fallout black plague analogous now. Bailout money, little was, middle lower class going filter upwards. Perhaps increasing prices private experience. usual corporate shenanigans. personal info. think Brazil sadly end deaths end this. can't believe % positive , absolutely insane. delusional. ""**Weekly number deaths (from causes)** ""

I looking graph seeing blip whatsoever months June. excess deaths occurred March-May. lived UK, agree commenter. food awful except Indian food. take much fried shit carbs. Seasoning spices unheard of. Haggis pretty good. Way undermine accomplishments sexualising name.  
*(Mickey Mouse voice)* Oh no!   You’ve misunderstood post. tested positive, eventually hospitalized, deteriorated point couldn’t breathe own, ventilator long enough virus ran course tested negative, damage lungs remained, followed death. protest cops need dispersing. Yeah unfortunately stores want kick people wear masks safety factor person may shoot minimum wage employee telling leave. Air travel never shut get keep pushing indoor dining drinking. Patios much safer right summer anyway like cold anything. They're again, false equivalency Biden bad Trump, Biden pedo, he's senile. Also reiterating thing last election, saying primaries rigged factual data says otherwise. playbook 2016 reused. impressed Costco employee handled this. widely published New York outbreak east coast clusters european strain.... Sorry hear. I've reading articles virology scientific sites weeks I've read...Covid19 hamper immune systems drastically. Thats concern ppl virus field...that news Trumps crew letting ppl know abt. thing attacks every organ body damaging 10-15% even someone asymptomatic. sets future illness susceptibility. 

Immunity bullshit I've read well. best someone gets antibodies maybe 2-3 months they're gone. thing hiding cells like HIV attacks T-cells like HIV does.

Now 2nd strain thats aggressive infecting ppl rapidly...hence huge surges taking place. talked virologist early April online told collegues convinced thing going rear head mid June did...it going wash country like wildfire. said ppl way cavalier ignorant effects...and would lead serious consequences. Looks like spot on. beaches closed, people congregate together indoors. even worse. Ugh.

Even barring taking mask cough, *you're supposed cough shoulder ground*. That's even COVID thing, that's common decency thing. It’s phase three set approved/disapproved October/November. FDA likely approve first round vaccinations willing vulnerable/healthcare workers mass distributed January February. That’s best timeline estimate. particular modified MERS vaccine wasn’t scraped together January. 

How would feel doesn’t come? Idk, much different. lockdowns easing I’m young immune issues I’m gonna keep living life. don’t shame people wanna stay inside forever believe society collapse also think probably therapy. 

The reality virus statistically dangerous enough total shutdown. 100% this. I'm local, genuinely freaked out. even know anymore... Probably case. one, insurers reinsurance claims 100k typically claims costly would spread payers. Also, although COVID claims make news expensive overall claims actually lower due elective surgeries cancelled/postponed. Sadly, right. ONE case tracked fast. entire towns cities populated inconsiderate people care people view masks violation freedumbs contact tracing invasion privacy well, wants super spreader among them?

New Zealand great job eliminating virus. keep working hard order stop things getting worse. saying would personally comfortable losing source income. Losing house. Losing car.

Comfortable? No. think right decision? Yes. Would fortitude make decision? know, hope really awful thats real situation occurring here.

I know, absolute think mostly agree

I think gym owner responsibility community, includes employees he's keeping payroll. system live in. hard perfect idealist make 'correct' moral decision decision could quite literally ruin life, national crisis less. 

You're 100% correct here. disagree all. So, perspective perhaps better analogy they're careening downhill car full people. even shittier choice, still think ""right"" decision, much one exists, prioritize collective I'd also like note virus kill everyone.

Absolutely true, still point know little long-term adverse heath effects even asymptomatic cases. Remember, people ""recover"" end needing double lung transplants. Well half people average intelligence. Reddit full young educated individuals skews people's views public look outside reddit stupid rest internet is. 75% Americans college degree, 10% high school degree. Also college students necessarily intelligent non graduates generally considered educated non graduates yet despite stereotypes antivaxxers actually likely college education. see individuals like Trump anomaly. represent millions American people. shit how! think people understand exponential growth works---especially said growth exploding course two weeks (and eventually impact death count).  Might ask use cover eyes? Thanks high quality article! ""future zoonic events"" seeing. Unless read wrong suggesting finding origin help current outbreak. definitely help future, for. trying state earlier, probably poorly. think experts studying now, matter find, dont think help rest us this. 

I think greatest boon studying now, opposed retrospect, ability collect data might overlooked studies.

I also speak much authority. Hell, I'm mechanical engineer taken biology since early high school. someone Florida worried effect hurricanes hospitals south Florida least. Hospitals backup generators basically anything built really strict codes. Anything code got blown away Hurricanes Francis Jeanne. doubt even category 5 could much hospital built 1992 here. 

There may supply issues hospitals impassible roads bad hurricane think storm would push hospitals much harder Covid already will. countries go back anywhere near normal numbers falling dramatically. US seems couple days falling numbers decided massive party.
The UK locked Leicester numbers rising slightly. US record day record day still acting though best world tackling Covid. 

The US currently joke entire world blind see part problem, countries behaving like you. I’m ready get back normal life all. shit happening random heat wave, imagine Christmas New Years. Indian PM’s popularity even close plummeting. Idk you’re work wants bring people back soon, wants many staff campus Fall possible.

Of course, buildings 1 bathroom pair per floor students staff faculty share. Remember Alamo, dammit.....

only time somewhat preventable They've thought long hard it, wearing mask hill they're going die on. Misinformation like announcements surgeon general... Australia too.  It’s pleasantly. hope people don’t start sharing feelings talking every time gifted polite greeting. want hear anyone’s life. all. No. Yeah it’s one things I’m afraid ever get COVID. Like think much rather take mine chances home work years pay debt. shit ton decent fireworks happening neighborhood tonight. pretty amazing. Maybe, would spend bit longer make sure reached last stage capitalism. sets us apart rest world. second line Constitution, right declaring wealthy white males equal. ok forgot it: like movie catch TV, often forget there's beginning. lot people scared too. Transferring blame natural unconscious response something overwhelming. cut dry ""that horrible person wont accept reality."" CCP partychair (governor basically) 4 high officials kicked office almost immediately Feb.

Jilin partychair also kicked office well outbreak couple hundred case.

Beijing fired Fengtai district party chair weeks ago (guy charge 2-3 million people) failure detecting cluster Xinfadi 

But Cuomo still governor NY.

Authoratarian government may transparent, mean bad governance zero accountability. 

In fact accountability may even worse due lack transparency. Two Hubei's top officials fired ""disappeared"" currently found. guys want stand human rights violation Hubei officials CCP? (im getting mad now) DIDNT privacy laws prevent photo ops like iron lung wards. video ICU Italy way closest thing. One American mates US hospital (I used work developing EHR systems there) said actual number healthcare worker deaths America much higher this, simply number reported media. Due American health privacy laws (HIPAA) clinical centres allowed report background individuals affected COVID-19, number noted product self-reporting media families case. large majority healthcare worker deaths sadly go unreported, real number apparently staggering. He's lost almost dozen colleagues knows large hospital system alone (one first hit hard initial US wave cases steadily rising again). went grocery shopping mother yesterday. cashier wearing mask cleared throat transaction. mom ""kindly"" chastised coughing without covering face.

I embarrassed fuck Obese necessarily mean BMI 36 considered deadly COVID. Americans obese, fraction BMI36+. condone violence worth slap firm enough welt “I healthy“... fat Florida's population actually almost 22 million 2020. Sadly deaths spike New York daily levels peak take seriously even then, say fake numbers Mexico, every country world issue. worse others, it’s easy counting dead bodies best friend's dad died, aunts caught nearly died, wear mask. think trying kill cap. even eating anymore can't judge I'm either. virus devastated city.

So far excess deaths align well detected cases texas. reported covid deaths align well it. means nothing works virus

Duh! would estimating?? count dead bodies, need estimate anything.......... Wtf 2020 respelling Inb4: China's data can't possibly true! Despite high profile nationwide efforts went fighting outbreak, China's real numbers must highest world! means nothing works virus can't let ruin lives economy! Reopen NOW! /s know know Bill, internet simply tool. Oh thought locking entire Catalonia. I'm sure locking Segria enough, there's noticeable uptick infections one town probably already spread beyond there. They're also cool shooting teargas peaceful protesters separating illegal immigrant children families border. get point would also like freedom nude public Yeah. mean, like killed hundreds thousands US alone anything. people pretending that's gloomy topic?

I remember behaved last time. hope death rate stays lower. time, before. think premature say either way. disemboweled clears said (which put perfectly) basically MERS vaccine already passed safety trials modified it. America: *cracks knuckles* Where's sex list? hahah...haha...ha.......ha.

Oh kidding. Zero risk me. US? country actually handling virus well? US son would much much much likely get virus going anywhere public America Japan.  That's good know enough consider risk me.

I can't comprehend could live surface days, even hours copper, food 15 20 minutes.

I would bet ever outbreak restaurant would always assume air VS able tell server coughing food.

I would venture likelyhood landing food catching versus catching indoor air environment poor ventilation would vastly lower though. dick oh wait cant Beaches used pretty dead, especially summer, reason they’re packed. That’s thing miss. beach, never go now. home endlessly one greatest treasures I’ve ever gotten. don’t understand loneliness wanting around strangers acquaintances getting sick family don’t want understand it. West Nile Virus 2007 seriously ill months still day chronic headaches virus. wish anyone... caught Covid friend playing flute? really odd hill lady die on. Considering age, may actually die hill. Oh yes! forgot mention took 6 billion number appeared largest amount doses flu vaccine globally ever managed manufacture 12 months. 

I happily take vaccine least 4 6 months human trials. one month way little. hard balancing act obviously, us. clears said (which put perfectly) basically MERS vaccine already passed safety trials they'd modified it. No, get eaten shark surfing dead test positive still count coronavirus death look man

i believe assume shit airborne act accordingly......

fuck back forth bullshit. Smart enough wear mask dumb enough blame Asians. Ironic. Mmm mmm mmm mmm most, rate per day $50. ""I killed people! cool?""

What colossal ass. sorry come this. 

Remember wave doctors nurses rushed NYC pitch in? would nice health care workers able come help fill gaps, give guys breather. 


I hope colleagues getting least rest recovery time. Stay safe. sister took family friends family restaurant yesterday. Posted FB. asked good idea given virus situation told “everyone decide themselves” exactly reason shit show currently in. Also wore masks, something else makes ok (though clearly eat manner goes mask effective). absolutely correct, however left another key part social media: organized promoted protests, bringing thousands upon thousands people clustered together (often without masks) spreading it. problem people conspiracy theories doubt virus' deadliness, also people well aware deadliness feel important enough keep isolating distancing.

However would point US far country social media, social media blame indicates something within American culture itself. Perhaps way American news sensationalizes things constantly, leading people either doubting seriousness, easily becoming outraged. school promising private dorm anyone wants one. think whole thing absurd classes online. Alina Chan gives example feels Say right. Ever heard emergency court proceedings related health emergency. journalist still lying?

Go back bed. eCOnOMy expect? indoors, meants stay home realize that’s death rate 0.3% You’re caricature. “Love leave it” filing chapter 7 won’t. 1 every 2 tests positive Brazil  Yep! Everything said correct, except 7.5 billion people 6 billion. Thanks actually math, watching something lazy. 0.0001% number referencing. 

I completely agree situation little bit fallacy would never vaccinate whole world, however typically vaccinate much larger population expect infected population be. 

My fiancee also high risk, feel same. Higher risk tolerance vaccine fine, without evidence/data cannot even quantify real risk. makes little skeptical approach. think oxford vaccine others, operating highly accelerated timeline great job balancing risk vs payoff. Time tell though, I'm expert this. Asian children soldier little facemasks, western adults full psychological meltdowns.

Pathetic. Stop indulging them. Yeah, keep spewing conspiracy theories. See great that’s working Americans don’t believe coronavirus even real. 👆 he's one case Australia Costa Rica. Early efforts great worked people stopped caring distance/masks continued life usual. 

In Victoria state, locked public housing Melbourne.

 CR, number daily cases end April/mid-May single digits. economy re-opening began May 23, recall July 4 government recording 310 cases per day. CR excellent health care system see happens. first explore HCQ treatment early symptom onset. Deaths remained low far 18.

With infectious seems be, countries done well early suppressing spread time contact trace bolster health care facilities thereby giving opportunity catching outbreaks earlier rather able contact trace. think side effect mask wearing stressed more. less infections due smaller outbreaks masks, contained. See: Taiwan, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Thailand, South Korea. amount detail new case actually incredible something countries strive towards. also read something Korean CDC said new outbreaks Seoul different strain virus earlier outbreaks Daegu Itaewon.

Food thought: U.S. CDC issued avoid non-essential travel notice S.Korea Feb 25. difference 4 months made... Yeah. I’m ER doctor. I’m living fear, don’t want see hundreds thousands people die disease could mitigated. Crazy, know.  way home work, way people streets setting 4th July witnessed, especially compared last year walked around town couple hours barely saw anyone setting fireworks. unlikely. delivery systems vaccines lead strong side effects minority individuals, common bad scenario would ineffective vaccine. confuses even one state governer. People keep saying ""hospitals"" fudging numbers. Like every single hospital, regardless owners, country, political ideals banded together specifically report false numbers reason. Apparently Covid unified world, name evil. Look guy doesn’t bother research, goes gut.

You know tell China isn’t making up?

Because fucking lock coronavirus shit soon small cluster appears.

A week ago, [**12 cases** appear Anxin county outside put 500,000 people lockdown. 

Yeah, you’ve gotten used incredibly stupid American policy ignoring massive infection rates it’s late—and can’t wrap head around (granted, repressive) regime that’s willing take ever steps necessary eradicate deadly disease.

And that’s US losing. see that, I’m obsessed zombie , horror really apocalyptic/post apocalyptic films books. I’ve fine since day 1, almost fine lol like bring baby , I’ve ready whole god damn life! we've barely hit street let alone gone far Road. spouting politicized nonsense research. Early research shows D614G mutation significantly virulent due 1: higher spike protein density surface- 4-5x higher; 2: increased spike protein stability. fast pace evolving situation important note still researched fully.  insurance like loads people? Mortality increases substantially hospitals overwhelmed. may 1% normal circumstances rises substantially past peak capacity clinicians start fall ill. cases ordinary circumstances might survive die instead. mortality rate ideal circumstances, collapse medical response far higher. “A bottle (booze type here) day” means fifth. 750ml.

What tryna say here, playa? Assuming mean Wales UK, 3m population, Florida 21m. Spain, am, 46m think peak 9000, around 3 weeks super strict lockdown. I'm supposed Florida right holiday. Fuck I'm glad I'm not. talking someone Ohio playing multiplayer video game. called local governments requiring masks subordinates presidents. listening pretty much traitorous be.

Are people Ohio like this? Ohio key swing state are, I'm scared country come Nov. guy also ass though insulting another player skills I'm sure him. came post exactly that. Spain 46m people florida 21.5m, still, Spain peaked 9.5k infected day... Even infections might underreported... twice population... :/ Microdroplets stay air head height least 10 hours indoors.  people's masks imperfect, still useful mitigate transmission covid19, they'll catch droplets large tiny invisible. Happy 4th July! 🇺🇸 slow. reckless bold thinking we're best world thinking Gov take care everything. We're smart ignorant make sense? I'm also sick fake news snowflakes. like primary school, somebody tells something like fake news. worry America infections time lag deaths. feel related comment, last November deleted social media relieved forgotten unaware anyone else's life.

I even used social media, Instagram 4 photos uploaded since 2013, Facebook like 5 6 couple comments high school, never used twitter all, never used snapchat, never used anything.

I thought almost one besides small group close friends would notice absence months passed surprised people reached me, people thought meant nothing would probably never see hear life again.

I reached old friends childhood, crushes long time ago, family members seen ages on. felt good knowing people care much went way reach still think me. made appreciate even want reconnect.

Oh wow, that’s nice warning actually - “pay funeral front, survive...well done!” Bioterrorism. Send gitmo live terrorists roommates brought IIRC mentioned New York hospital putting causes death COVID even though seemed like died reasons. roommates told something effect state gets kind money state per person dies COVID. 

Im saying isn’t case haven’t researched might hear talking points similar those. wouldn’t surprised though. would pretty hilarious ngl  raised actually $1M and/or 3 years prison.

Chipotle accidentally makes people sick E Coli meat face financial punishment. people creating covid Hotspots knowingly, I'm seeing anyone take court suing hospital bills. think New York already wave hunderd thousand infections, testing became widely available.

Florida going direction fast, suspect quite yet.

Or maybe wishful thinking. Another New York would horrible.

And currently multiple states bad path. Imagine three version New York happening simultaneously. Absolutely frightening.

I think become quite bad, yes might wishful thinking. It’s time doctors nurses everyone even janitors go strike. Fuck idiots thinking “above” wearing mask. cool. Um...wow. know say! feel like comment show support though. anyone around agree though?  noted viewership ""Contagion"" rose dramatically first months coronavirus pandemic. 

Raise hand pulled ""The Stand.""

I know did. Yeah, well women family deal beatings. family small-minded shitty town moved away years ago. May wait delay passing older relatives. Oh fuck off. 4th July. people exist stand public call someone Dirty Faggot get killed, Nigger get city, context verbal abuse, terms derogatory directly many discrimination laws. Also saying someone 'im going rape least expect it'

This free speech yes, threats rape someone blatently attack discrimination. work too, say whatever want boss 'free speech' get sacked it? StIll BlEaCH InJeCtiOnsS Yeah not, legally could arrest flr paging bills like those. even put warrant it. USA debters jails. I'm always bit surprised see California trajectory. rather well beginning think. wear mask, distance upvote you. three. Wishing strength. Technically it’s 0.3996124969726326% 

but thought 0.3% enough accuracy 

Here’s link check It’s America, it’s mean tell obese people lose weight health’s sake videos NYC hospitals back outbreak. Maybe administration actually something combat it, happen. Hell yeah response political. 100% correct. Shame censor one word post stay up.

The automoderator Reddit control needs removed. Damn. charged $8 hair net given surgery. I'm glad $800. Canada realistic alternative not? Life insurance probate court things money deposited ABA bank airport. I've lived Cambodia long time I'm quite aware corruption apply everything. Cases started going back US June 14th, 3 weeks ago. started see deaths go point?

Meanwhile 7 day average deaths still going down. know there's reports ICUs states getting full seen deaths increase yet. Wishful thinking maybe virus mutated less deadly form. 

What think? may see deaths increase next week? ESL ?  know RN US like that. Sadly there's medical professionals think artificially inflated joke too. Crazy times... 14 day quarantine thing seems pretty common. New Zealand, Japan, etc., seem require it. never mentioned invincibility dude. I’m sure plays role kids age naturally feel invincible increases agency freedom new adults.

There studies support assertion social media increases narcissism reduces empathy.

Never claimed reasons lack responsibility. Yeah couldnt agree more. think conversation nuanced lot surface level discussion see reddit. think important get root issue makes addressing issue easier. call someone asshole they're scared likely wont successful trying correct behavior. re-upload mirror? site hugged death lol right same-sex couples marry, right same-sex couples adopt, right transgender people use preferred bathroom, right transgender people obtain health care, etc.

My freedom, yours. Except businesses asking increased testing since beginning debacle. So, businesses know get handle pandemic, economy fail, too. Can't prop economy dead people. canceled emergency declaration all. loosened restrictions told people ""When outside home? Wear masks avoid large crowds!"" watched Contagion early January. scared shit global outbreaks began happening also lot mentally prepared considering movie tense paints much darker picture pandemic. totally agree directed towards non essential stuff like restaurants beuticians Exactly. article “healthy” teenager unfortunately died Covid. Kid looked morbidly obese photo There’s several lines, don’t worry. warning stats 99.8% kids fine. COURSE outliers. logic, give driving cars people die cars. give riding bikes one person fell hit head. live bubbles forever safe. 

Reality constantly make risk/benefit decisions. less .2% mortality rate something I'm afraid of. Cambodian border agents also ""bank tellers"", yes, absolutely do. Corruption sadly pervasive. Nonsense, know people gotten almost money back short quarantine. would bit silly lol, peoples vacations barely last week two, tell need pay 100 bucks well, think would better say everyone stay home I'm saying curve overload hospitals 10 years long. 

You're saying they'll quit admitting 60+ people, would hospital overload I'm talking about. 

You're talking millions unnecessary deaths want cheat New Zealand's work. Reading teared up. I’m literally begging you, wear mask, stay home, please stop spread COVID. don’t want normal checkup see people lined across halls nearly dying. “I healthy”. No, you’re overweight would surprised India massive mandatory vaccination campaign PR purposes. First vaccine, first mass vaccinate. 

If India, may choice refuse. Borepocolypae texas numbers started rise end may already time excess deaths recorded already. rise Florida's cases started around june 10th deaths make statistics yet start around like texas official corona virus deaths seem rise probably report way.

I expect see first visible rise data end june becomes available. gonna arrest almost dying

Also, pay friend buy medical debt pennies dollar? Plot twist, massive country wide riots 40 million people outside responsible spike cases. Turns phrase “black lives matter” doesn’t cure vaccinate viruses. imagine. wish best hope somehow turn better. Ya, shit. Considering Cambodia's average annual income per capita around $300 USD

That might true 25 years ago, certainly now.  FIL's ex-wife got fired job FIL go medically induced coma years ago this.

They're basically great getting around quickly, without sweating get normal cycling, popular work/school travelers. think social media created feeling invincibility youth, really cut social commentary Blame Windows 95 making internets much easier  bad Hawaii country enforce strict quarantine rules arrivals. example, country (Philippines) handling Covid well, least ability require people entering country mandatory 14-day quarantine designated hotels quarantine facilities near airport. Hawaii suggest thing can't enforce Personally, “Social distancing” meant “complete social isolation” three months. I’m wits end. can’t keep much longer. People go flu season 'may' killing people.

See stupid sounds?

People: time admit bulk people get coronavirus... fact ultra-majority... mild symptoms.

If want people stay home going give ""They may harm someone!"" real world. Especially federal government helping people provide when/if stay home!

Bottom lining here: pre-ex's, elderly, live two groups? Stay home wear mask go out.

For rest us? past time allow us live damned lives albeit wearing mask whenever around people outside family.

Yes, us includes parents died CoVid-19 die.

However past viruses killed much people comes it... cough... polio 1/10 measles 1/12... lockdowns.

Why necessary honestly?

The thing really necessary masks worn air recirculators like air conditioners stop used.

There good bit evidence air recirculators suck virus compress air X indoor area. little encouragement. really ""sunbath"" depending close equator live ""peak sun"" likely really necessary early spring fall noon-hour time day UV-light contains enough UVB induced Vitamin production.  mid-summer...even 5-10 minutes sun arms legs (as much skin possible) really help keep Vitiman levels sunlight induced Vitamin efficient better (there benefits -- like heart health) using supplements.  

I'm suggesting maybe year Covid running rampant. 50 states are. Someone reddit posted historic average monthly deaths, average pneumonia deaths, alleged COVID deaths state.. numbers add, there's drastic increase people dying counted covid deaths. guess total US covid related deaths closer 150k-200k. worse part anti-maskers making memes government counting everything COVID death. [I can't find original yale similar take see CDC link essentially thing. love horror movies, including apocalyptic post-apocalyptic ones. agree this. Lol first heard rumblings coronavirus January started little little buying stuff like masks, little extra paper canned goods, instant foods, rice, flour yeast, etc. saw nobody else weeks later and, time, fine going store replenish perishables. Why? ive watched many movies shit hit fan everyone freaked ran stores. Lol mountains us Floridians! r/GhanaSaysGoodbye stats sure didn’t work well little 11 year old boy died alone Florida hospital. Percentages great alleviating fears affect someone love. feel bad grocery store. 

As grocery store employee near Charlotte...that frightening scene, knowing people coming store. still don’t get bunny suits. gown. least finally got rid bullshit shear yellow ones. ya foot covers useless ppe ever Shareholders compensation us much choice. I've looked work visa requirements many different countries skill set would allow enter work professional job. I'm sure I'm alone. lack education experience, highly specialized US.

I'm getting close retirement though, father, although excellent health, old. would remaining reasons stay US, since family obligations home, independent income require work visa, live pretty much anywhere. Bank tellers often steal money.  see this. government keeping us inside control us. 

I live state pretty much reopen. go restaurant, gym, salon. Essential services never closed people encouraged go outside (not packed beach whatever though). 

Is asked wear mask? think it’s low. Everyday 500 die Covid. say death count low already 130 thousand Americans dead dying day, also downvote doesn’t match reality. Remember average person LIKE READ, 5 minute video Facebook connect someone incredible level, even whatever video completely wrong taken context.. exactly what’s happening. Lazy people getting informed via Facebook, taking opinions facts obviously absolutely research.

Facebook social media outlets (in opinion) incredibly destructive dangerous thing simpletons tinker with. change person drive mad they’re strong enough.. already know problem mental illness, drugs loonie people. :((( 

I don’t know fix Facebook better job screening content story Apple News (swiping right iPhone home screen) least week. idea Covid, awful story Correct. Many millennials think we’ve simply sacrificed enough old. Economic environmental destruction. asked mortgage entire future sake elderly.

Many us saying thank you. Ya fuck him, work sales/account management, it’s time started speaking encountering utter fucking bullshit comes virus, everything else.

More common sense, less trying appease shitty people. oh no. happen? surely way prevent tragedy... use take big whiff orange tanner? I’m confused rankings; particularly comes control situation. 

For example: going walk others (outside, masks, distancing other) ranking grocery shopping (indoors, little control behavior others whether they’re wearing mask). Largest medical system world. found health insurance ending coverage covid 7/30. :( live hotspot. I'm preparing watch credit, getting okay spot, tank. agree sentiment general, one area think could unwise: dentistry. limiting/temporarily ceasing elective care may wise, shutting dentistry altogether shifts problem already overwhelmed hospitals. Bill Gates psychopath let's kid ourselves.  want to. mean, fact could theoretically worse mean bright side virus becoming contagious less dangerous. think American “individualism” polite way saying selfishness. think lot Americans believe want believe based convenient and/or makes feel good. Well really takes someone walking exhaling inhale yourself. nose mouth, virus particle land head, hand, face etc..luckily masks help lot Stay home, get teated. right thing do. Texas counties report weekends, real number much worse take it, till approved FDA. also largest hospital system entire world...

Err, metric? instance, Englands NHS worlds 5th largest employer 2015 according Wikipedia.

But, agree it’s grim. publicity stunt want attention divert people real issue 

Failed lockdown 

Now votes giluidebiok indeed Great article. Well said. Way people die due corona deaths, cases people die even get tested. People die homes it, they’re hospital lot deaths piling sometimes don’t time count it. happened Italy believe NY peaked. Also complications COVID-19, someone terminal cancer example catches COVID dies complications, count COVID death cancer death? hundred people die hospital one day, can’t really count 100 COVID deaths expect accurate reflection. 

I believe there’s 3-4 week lag states even get official cause death certificate, something along lines anyway. line choose draw sand? think Trump also added dragged educators mix regards history taught. lot depend located though. live liberal city large companies allowing mandating WFH 2021 local leaders get serious strict things done, hopefully. However, saying believe huge domino effect people letting hair schools open it’s false sense security. cases rise might blame teachers, “why teach kid wash hands better?”, “why didn’t social distance?”, “why open schools it’s safe?”
Schools already work supply tech, internet, food, school supplies, lessons, translators district paid rent families time gone one almost 5 months people forgotten much work put making closure successful could. Even mom healthcare said schools open made comment today hopes property tax returned 🤦🏻‍♀️ Indeed unless Biden and-or team grow spine, lack universal healthcare also unironically destroy US economy since COVID-19 never control. many uninsured underinsured Americans afraid even get tested coronavirus leave alone treated fear medical bills, percolates superspreads over. universal health care Europe absolutely essential bringing pandemic control since people fear testing treatment, we're able transparently contact tracing stop spread. add top millions perhaps tens millions American COVID-19 survivors long term health consequences, early data indicating, another formula cripple American economy unless truly universal healthcare instituted. Biden wins really choice matter go direction, else perhaps USA faces revolution pandemic never control economy never recovers. What's even worse complete lack empathy others he'll use ""proof"" virus ""that bad."" Rogan, Callen, Schaub irresponsible hell spreading much misinformation downplaying severity disease (especially considering huge fanbase largely consists young men), think Schaub takes cake continuing downplay shirking moral responsibility self-quarantine. morally decrepit get? assure guy horrible person based couple years interact projects.

That said, get you’re saying regarding people fit type behaviour general regarding virus. problem is, doesn’t matter *why* they’re behaving like - actions, accurately, *inaction* directly responsible prolonging worst pandemic many places.

At certain point need take responsibility behaviour, scared absolve that. went pick curbside pizza night min late curbside ends 10pm. meant go inside get it. packed, like people door packed left. masks. Friends hugging shaking hands. Everyone amazing time without care world. admit bit jealous “freedumb.” applies person poses clear present imminent danger others. enforced law enforcement.

There emergency proceedings health emergencies. county used measles outbreak two years ago. hope people change mind like right away. rushed 50% effective vaccine would help, might discourge investment 80% effective ones. Sneezing coughing causes droplets large small. even talking laughing cause microdroplets saliva ejected mouth. Microdroplets stay air head height least 10 hours indoors.  people's masks imperfect, still useful mitigate transmission covid19, they'll catch disease bearing *droplets* large tiny invisible. 

Aerosolised viruses hang air without droplet saliva mucus around known 'Airborne' medical technical sense.  Airborne disease like measles swept surface like doorknob resting fly air.

Technically covid 19 far known 'Airborne' medical technical sense. Even though possible catch covid 19 breathing microdroplets exhaled someone else 10 hours ago, indoor space are. Unlucky quite possible.

This medical technical use word Airborne helpful.  layperson ""I catch covid 19 microdroplets floating air 10 hours infected person talked space."" ""imperfect masks significantly drop chances catching covid19 micro droplets"" pretty fucking important information know. Fuck off, dude. Early March China reported zero new cases outside Hubei province. statistically impossible.

We found China didn’t even tell outbreak first place, narrative they’ve driving since day one. Hell, tried blame US that!

China heavily suppresses outside reporting, doesn’t allow neutral entities verify reported numbers. believe they’re telling truth blatant, irresponsible ignorance. Remindme! 27 Days Yea, worded wrong. angrily hit send without proofreading it. changed reflect true message trying convey. know 5 percent mortality rate give take, I'm concerned strain going put health care system long term quality life impact ""recovered."" point knows man individuals develop chronic conditions cleared virus. LSD Nice try Bill, I'm getting round-earth-moon-landing-was-real-microchip-vaccine Yeah acting alone without outside interference, undoubtedly funded developed deadly virus underground Chinese live animal lab period two weeks personally infected every single one people Covid-19, himself. way insurance companies much power healthcare system responds setup. Also Italy like this... even clubs began reopen, everything else pretty much open Teenage one-ear mask dangling new pants sagging. Clearly Nope Supply demand. Amusement parks short supply. Italian, say pretty rough... anyway respected strict quarantine policy social distancing beginning see finish. Cases dropping (we less 100 people intensive care moment population 60M) say proud Italy Italians look USA, whatever compliance measures contain virus seem bad sister ICU nurse 8 years hospital NY. said treating virus traumatized her, transferring office job. Oh good - keep hearing people brag amazing masks...that notice outflow valves, want strangle them. Funnily enough, normally get Black people. asked thing way around get shocked. 

In UK though tends less common since people first gen there. plain sight Council voted mandatory public spaces. Right. certain population seems think dunk covid, bully ""own it"", somehow diminished face bravery patriotism shit.

Nope. go covid pit maybe infect nurse toddlers home seen mommy 4 weeks trying protect family.... Same....I've retired due it....Ireland much younger people now. tend get sick.

[This article chart median Chinese, want say

The U.S. government without China, without Italy, without Germany, without Western European country

But could learn Canada, right next you, hard learn? embarrass America? Can't get Canada send team medical experts teach experience?

The first step solving problem admitting it, US government even courage admit Look brave, mute downvoters. say India's curve Worldometer certainly best fit exponential. You’re completely forgetting numbers averages, huge standard deviations. increase probably observable maybe 1.5-2 weeks peak increase 3 weeks big enough. Shit yeah people saying ""it's bad flu"".

Like bitch know bad influenza actually knocks 1-2 weeks lose 10 pounds spend next 6 months constant state exhaustion **worse** know people cautious it.  I'm sure charging people low rates profitable charging fewer people cosmic rates. opinion based? find evidence? count lucky many ICU survived presented bills excess $100,000 Jesus.
How guy managed avoid getting Coronavirus? recently noticed feels ridiculously difficult breathe get nauseated disoriented. dr finally came conclusion it’s anxiety wearing mask. Don’t get wrong still wear mask go public, absolutely count next 24 hours trying recover stress anxiety puts body. 

Sucking never work situation honestly. understand sentiment. want people wear masks too. isn’t difficult concept follow. come learn past months, many us even clearly understand ""white"" is. example, fair-skinned Argentinean Spanish-descent colleague shared us day white. Yeah suck ass 795k. living humans even look numbers get sent bills? Australia blacklisted British ladies passport ignored quarantine described China dealt early outbreak Wuhan also North East, Beijing. Possibly one thing. virus ravaged NY one expected bad. Many people locked still family members/roommates about. 

NY especially NYC showed country (and rest world) bad really be. lot people FL states health issues extra vigilant. didn’t window opportunity NY. 

This plus fact healthcare systems better prepared, PPE testing hopefully make less lethal. Chicago going challenged court. Enough said.

Yeah, whoever's challenging *lose*.

Local authority power enforce quarantine measures extremely well-settled law. gone Supreme Court many times repeatedly upheld, point *Compagnie Francaise de Navigation Vapeur v. Louisiana Board Health* (1902), dissenting opinion even stated quarantine power exists ""so well settled repeated decisions Court longer open doubt"". much cost EU? need comparison Favipiravir patent. Finally we're getting reliable studies game :)

...yet I've still got people around claiming european lockdowns necessary USA either... Yes still distinction made much cost EU? need comparison bike picture likely e-bike 20 miles road cycling nothing worth mentioning. recovery afternoon ride. Notice mention died 😂😂😂😂 I'd also like add somethime heard last night. USA \~4% world's population 25% world's COVID-19 deaths.

Similarly, USA \~25% world's prison inmates.

Wow... I’m wondering quit job isolate.. cruel thing virus seems cases serious complications happen A-HOLES.

Anti-vaxxer Novak Djokovic example hosting ironic Covid fundraiser infects every player there... there's NBA/MLB/NHL players social media blatantly ignoring distancing rules parties get togethers feel special. Noticed too. Graph needs clarification. even quoted still don’t get it. implied face masks harm good. right approach, given PPE shortage, would encourage makeshift face coverings would enforce message face coverings effective also much desired effect without depleting supply health care workers. guess you’re obstinate simply stupid understand massively screwed messaging.  government approved conspiracies allowed. correction, club left. thing vote November.

But going seriously enjoy watching lose. bad assume he'll spend evening hiding room without cameras. one time I'd want see orange face. second wave china virus destroy economy, progressive calamity people denial fact CANT normal life COVID. think something ""stand up"" to, they're putting harm's way... bad article. even mention caught texas last week performing comedy podcast co-host Bryan Callen. podcast ""The Fight Kid"" go hard paint taking corona seriously lot, following lead Joe Rogan often appear on. subreddit turned long time pure comedy r/thefighterandthekid.

People already skeptical science (especially States wearing mask become political issue), flip-flop messaging adds confusion. shitshow proven needs serious reform top bottom.

Hong Kong, Japan, Korea way closer China, yet three handled virus way better US UK. factors may important (such obesity rates way lower East Asia US UK), wearing masks already part culture seen affront one's rights.

To dumbasses doubting army qualified doctors? There's nothing _more_ say except absolutely full bullshit. especially well victims! wouldn’t you? story March! ""The latest case numbers Florida, yet report statewide hospitalizations, surpassed highest daily tally reported European county height coronavirus outbreak there.""

Populations: Spain 46m Germany 83m  Italy 60m  France 65m  UK 67 million  Florida 21.5m 

So exceeding European countries totals less half population (at least.) Considering age demographics Florida could yet get many degrees worse. Stay safe. fortunate. wife make $500k year, also fortunate.

Fortunate medical emergency bankrupt us. Fortunate privilege poorest citizens almost developed nation enjoy.

This shit messed up. came Beginning June around 30 thousand deaths. doubled month. disaster.

And president, said “so what, I’m gravedigger” asked deaths reporter, among despicable things said, fully washed hands (no pun intended) ignoring pandemic completely.

Meanwhile seems leaders Congress, governors opposition parties given removing murderer presidency. man allowed remain power beyond comprehension. I’m even mentioning scandal corruption involving son, among investigations crimes family committed. 

I feel Brazilians terrified don’t go protest demand removal, feel hopeless become numb. Either way Brazil entering dark times. feel sad everyone specially parents lost jobs, children future, families lost loved ones. feel sadness lately.

i wish people knew irl virtual reality tho. thats even better. FFS people wear masks. helps fucking much Masks needed social distance. played Fallout New Vegas five years love post-apocalyptic movies. live dystopia feels like I'm movie would watch, book would read, let tell you, freaking fuck out. I'd lying said expected one say something good I'd say I'd agree. I've always drawn movies like 12 Monkeys Outbreak, saw happening China January, figured quickly anything going stop virus escaping China touching every corner world, disrupting supply chains, overwhelming healthcare systems creating social disorder unrest.

I saw going January started preparing ""the talk"" wife food, finances, health precautions, shit turn society upside down. feared she'd think crazy, honestly, crazy. attitude was, ""This shit's going happen, time deal rest country freaks out.""

Before got details what's going on, watch [Albert Bartlett's ""Most Important Video Ever See"" covers society grasp exponential growth also teaches understand already. premise is, human brain wired understand exponential growth naturally. Time time again, people underestimate processes grow exponentially, act late -- exactly we've seen United States leaders wished problem would go away.

I sold investments market crashed. Stocked food, medicine, household supplies, hand sanitizer, bought spare cell phone Shenzhen, China, global electronics manufacturing hub get shut down. goal *have* go anywhere 3 months society came grips going on.

I fortunate run errands first 3 months due preparation. point, major stores adapted home curbside delivery, able replenish everything went supplies.

If kind person fan apocalyptic movies, already familiar Albert Bartlett's work, doubt would processed going time ahead crisis.

The journey emotional wife, terrible feeling bringing blissful ignorance get right mindset prepare coming us. terrified somehow wrong completely losing respect looking like paranoid idiot too. turned out, anything we've regretted this. choice everything needed got party early fortunately. partisan term, Donald Trump popularized doesn’t mean people sides can’t use it. 400k people seems like quite bit people back lockdown Scrolling FB see punk went high school airport picking kid 2 weeks camp. Ummmm kid looked maybe 7 best. So, puts kid plane ships away 2 weeks pandemic? hate people. adore Nathan's hot dog eating competition, I'm really sure safest decision...

Cool see world records broken yesterday though! Go Joey! theory article true, might make sense actively infect people milder forms coronavirus? Yeah. hit kid, would completely fucked.

My internships ended paying college, anytime 18 previous years single illness accident could sent family gutter. Hell, crashed family car 17, luckily person equally fault/without insurance loss old beater.

It worse poor America literally developed country. 2% tested patients already died. deaths lag weeks behind.

Trump: virus harmless 99% tested people. issue idiots Ohio, swing state, meaning vote actually matters.  blame people. stupid. fucking. people.
social media gave platform. work 18 others crew 4 crews site sick since last March. missed work month time cold flu symptoms almost 4 weeks, actually found symptoms going away grocery store visited late March case covid cashiers rung groceries sick. got covid test done found point almost back 100% I'm sure test accurate. I've never sick long would surprised gotten it. Right, whole purpose slow spread, contain it. purpose BSL-4 personal protective equipment job. Also, alot consolidation wealth several people's assets could end 1 person cause many people dying. woman arrived Brisbane 27 June returned negative Covid-19 test three days woman charged Covid Act, maximum penalty six months prison $4000 fine hope piece shit dies. want go want NOW!!!! I've seen lot coworkers dual income families go single income reduce risk. I.e. nurse/cna/housekeeper quits hospital. 

I choice, I'm sole income start. do. Covid sucks ass, job deal it. long I'm getting paid here. pay cut, I'm going back self employment. much sucked, could still provide family. loans had, annual income same. handle new car till pay cash exchange going covid rooms several weeks old ppe. still allowing Americans go beyond border?! Build wall already! 'Merca  looks like NYC

We stayed home wore masks. 

And ambulance sirens non-stop. What's math? asked use confirmed cases. What's distasteful that? we've destroyed whole generation youth value.

We went board confidence, assertive, masculine bullshit none wisdom. 😂 oh little guy, nobody buys schtick. Ummm..... Fauci fucked mask thing lie us needing wear buy ppe. short sighted shit. instructions clear dick stuck drywall  Wear.A.Mask. Maybe virus 99% survival rate deal wearing something really muffles voice (half mask respirator case) randomly quote Bane/Darth Vader.  Remember CDC acknowledges 7 day delay deaths reporting symptom death time 18.5 days. June 8 + 25.5 days equals July 3rd. expecting see small increase deaths start yesterday. kinda reddit now.Im American election politic stuff kinda annoying now.I get point.I use app way hide certain subs annoying.The front page basically unbearable.Reddit good conversation kinda annoying every sub enter constant debate,everyday.All negative energy matter go cant good you.Social media annoying man little bit joy hook you.You leave often come back eventually. dunno. lt. gov looks even worse gov. It’s bandaid people. Rip fuck done it. You’re boat, boat 10,000 holes. Let sink. I’m saying isn’t clear mud you’re head clouds. Good luck, may immunity side. Eat veggies. Damn. hydroxychloroquine Yeah fucked people care, fucking country man. There's literally dozens companies agree . one risk health play baseball.  commercial hvac market basically trane carrier? lennox? hard imagine going college football fall. say moving season Apr. 2021 would idea. know baseball supposed 60-game season starting weeks sure that's gonna work either. Mike Trout Angeles said feeling safe last heard. NBA Bubble NFL probably without pre-season? lot hot spots around country exploding besides hear FL, AZ CA.

 Due extraordinary demand patterns, item may experience longer lead times.

So probably not. help control outbreak? someone tests positive, putting quarantine executing exact effect virus spread. 100,000 people died. Everyone deserves know origins happened simple solution that: 

People need read beyond headline article. think see extreme cases media skews perception actual situation ground.

It's likely Germany well, well Japan, way people responded general. let's say 80% people took precautions, R0 would less one virus spread grow exponentially. 40% did, R0 would creep back quickly.

I think applies especially elderly, responded whole system responded them. UK, example, lot spread care homes several failings start (e.g. carers travelling multiple care homes, lack ventilation, etc.) identified main factors.  “Contracted covid”. “Tested negative”. Pick one. senior manager, although insensitive, point. It’s likely didn’t covid didn’t test positive it. could factors, illnesses. fact you’re upvoted much ignorant replies response “i know someone died, insist COVID! know better doctor! “ Shows reddit fake woke army “Karens” pointing finger “Karens” second part post: Big data analysis AI sees go liquor store often, flags problematic pattern social credit score goes down. can't get loan bank cannot travel anymore volunteer 30 hours free time old people's home raise back up. Wild imagination? No, reality China soon wherever live. *cringe* fair, Covid one many threats faced with, need prioritize.

I certainly want situation I'd choose demonstrating something might kill friends/family staying home avoid contaminated something might kill friends/family. it’s constitutional right...

That’s keep hearing work etc. stupidity culpable. FFS don’t “constitution”. Let’s get bogged facts though.

It’s virus. It’s bad thought still kills vulnerable (i.e grandma) even you’re fit still cost weeks work get bad case. ideal one 52% casual workforce don’t get sick pay. 

Being virus doesn’t care boredom/freedom/constitutional rights/protests privilege think deserve. It’s virus, programmed replicate needs hosts.

The pubs, beaches, shops, public transport etc shoulder shoulder. acting like beat responded hardcore early. Complacency downfall. Victoria isn’t exemption, scientific example complacency. They’re also impoverished country can’t afford completely shut economy like that. It’ll come choice going possibly dying virus staying definitely dying starvation. It’s least fairly low risk. 

She came Australia (not exactly hot spot)

She tested negative week stayed isolation first week mandatory two week travelers. 

So someone AFAIK symptoms, tested negative week ago, contact week, came relatively lightly hit area. 

Now I’m saying shouldn’t fined okay 14 days isolation going mentally challenging see might talk big deal. careful enough get infected. sympathy anyone does. threatening fight, protecting exploitation. Go America s#$%, currently #1 regards cases. Given stupidity going on, healthcare workers take strong stand refuse service people. people even want live USA anymore?

Most Americans health insurance, means annual pocket max, typically around $5,000-10,000. Americans, incur hospitals costs $10,000, insurance cover rest it. friend told covid fake, believe it. one ourbif local parks filled today July 4th, really believe it. I’m currently living Switzerland, probably tomorrow, people wore mask. 

I blame government. position mask changed significantly: lockdown, official position mask help general public wear them. lockdown changed recommended wear rush hour, barely anyone saw. changed Wednesday announced mask mandatory public transport starting next Mondsy. current position mask government help preventing catching covid, spreading it. is, far know, incorrect. Masks lower chance contracting bit, though much. Also, self-made masks recommended.

Interestingly enough, left wing parties holding bit mandatory masks public transport. free ones offered, work place obligated compensate neither public transport organizer. poor family thus may easily able afford masks, may cost around 100 CHF month.

In contrast, Austria mandatory mask grocery shops while, even handing free entering. I’d imagine people nowadays wearing masks this—they got used it. believe also Germany handed free mask public transport, though don’t know mandatory wear it. WH Press Conference Coronavirus, say one find ways cure injecting light even disinfectants lungs. lot people says miraculously go away April.

They say April year though.

These advises person big know what... b... br... brane... *CRAB BATTLE* really wish people would shove flashlight ass shot bleach let rest civilized world continue on. estimates China numbers 4x official number 2 million cases. 

The Russian numbers worth less digital pixels screen doctors ""falling hospital windows"" sound alarm lack PPE.

Mexican officials stated real number infections much, much higher official number. believe Afghanistan well. much I'd like believe Vietnam 0 deaths less 300 cases country 90+ million people, seems ends logic. North Korea still claiming 0 cases Covid-19 Close bars nationwide! Anti vaxxers keep Covid around said - made it, got given you. That's they're billionaires worried twelve hundred bucks. eye opening. (Not aware problem, especially American)..But really eye opening shitty. Yeah, peak got around second week full lockdown, would fine good reason street. many people LAX Iran. 

That doesn’t matter. - LAX - YVR (Vancouver) IKA (Tehran) happens every day. one flight could spread bio terrorist infectious disease dozens countries. massively expands risk Iran. india live, migrants die hunger rather coronavirus lockdown continues. Even due reduced economic activity people dying due hunger. everyone lucky enough get 600 dollars per week sit home.  mean never higher you.... Truth friend, friend. Lol. Well settles then. t18ptn’s snapshot specific area, single town, proven beyond doubt EMT Police chatting shit. There's plenty proof mask reduce spreading diceaces, quick Google search come enough studies. Seems bit extreme press criminal charges. mom dad you’d want face criminal charges that. Grow fuck idiot. sub full whiny little NWO rats mean not. rating declined completely embarassing incident Indo-China border. Anyway stay relevant Covid means deciding factor. Isnt military able set field hospitals aid overwhelmed regions. dont know downvoted. hope make throught time okay. hostile? saying dont communicate joke, people supposed know joking actually folks believe that? Poe's law that. negative press us getting record breaking numbers. Massachusetts getting lot praise mask use that’s reducing spread good job guys Gaand mara chaddi 400k baby? 400k pooping fucking baby? actually guys pay? comparing countries successfully contained covid. Korea, Vietnam, Taiwan, New Zealand heavily use social media. Yet struggle much US. Yeah, came state that's also basically eliminated COVID already tested negative once, risk absolutely infinitesimal. Good sign spend time worrying sort thing, really. change public

From person living country masks recommended used: actual fuck? Can't even change mask?
And anyway I'd argue small theoretical chances spreading anything higher closed bathroom outside. turbles tarbed. Given seriousness it, made felony, perma-banned country escorted border. ""Oh, house Alaska? Well suggest go Seattle hire boat. Sooorrrrryyyyy."" IIRC multiple cases dental hygienists transmitting virus. dentist wore mask, face shield, safety glasses.

This beyond irresponsible, dangerous. Yes, definitely paid sick leave. There's evidence new cases going lead deaths US. 2 weeks since surge median age reported cases dropped 65 35. means young people US getting tested often, think might due accessibility testing.  Right yes. Driven large part US, Brazil, SA, Mexico India. Many smaller countries also exponential. What’s point adding ‘this year’? year it’s around far isn’t kinda obvious? living mammal would better country Trump Nice. zoomed see works.
Maybe could also add 7 day rolling average new infections per 100000 inhabitants? believe less 20 border opened. Poland 4% treating virus seriously according latest poll. Expect new waves too. definitely would gross blast inside mask phlegm snot. Without spare mask, know would really do, think it. guess probably carry two masks. happened once, could happen twice. Hmmm. I'm going really hope happen me.

It sure would nice unified leadership embraced science, giving us clear instructions. us? many accounts think speak behalf everyone? NYC NJ. Similar population. 4x death rate. Please explain I'm Korean use Twitter. lot. like jail bonds money goes bounty hunters hunt ass BLAME LEASDERSHIP. Shameless, comment got deleted still here. Ha ha, who's insecure. Good riddance Pretty sure someone coughs/sneezes/aerosols around me, that’s gonna risk. hey, don’t you, American, tell me, Australian, control COVID-19. Wat Question 13: Glenda lives black acre creamery customers buy fresh ice cream. Brenda duty protect inviters coronavirus? duty, extinguished patrons required wear masks due lack state mandate? Please explain causes actions defenses 500 characters. mean wrong.... Wuhan-like virus discovered seven years ago

 Lol I'm neither Chinese US. stupid one you, throwing tantrums US vein never even distantly mentioned US comment 🙄 beg please. worry president. He's going fine true reality virus dependent droplets, also airborne. word used wrong here. Saying masks, masks use, help stop transmission airborne virus, replied to, incorrect misleading. us argue masks, should, saying airborne rather really is, droplet based, counter productive. assume lack critical thinking skills, like them. can't tell difference oppression reasonable precautions, assume can't well. think many imagined sharp July spike like seeing. work baseball wait. players want take care families. normally around $10k-$20k regular birth w/o complications, count paying OB appointments though. Good Covid policy economy first. dont know people running show cant see that. 

(Also applies climate crisis) beaches closed July 4th weekend, mayors governors give forethought happens beaches reopen Monday? imagine health authorities gotten board masking instead pushing whole sneezing elbow thing. many lives would saved? Yes. Kill him. They’re exactly like flu test use every single year. they've intentionally failing try link cases protests. people wearing masks, not, obviously. Smart glasses

This. People think safe wearing mask. 

Surely mask prevents *spreading* virus *have* it. 

*Only wearing* mask 100% prevent getting virus. Apparently Pre WWIII scenario Yay devasted physically financially, eventually pulling end!?! Weird, buddy nurse treats COVID people says big deal. cruise ship complete disaster.. probably imagine military style quarantine handled everything extreme caution... Naa. complete utter disaster. letting passengers mingle. sick food servers distributing food. People playing phones in-between room visits.. secure ideology running around like road runner gaand fire. Zooomggg insult country. Lol.

That chaddi gang done good country you

Its contribution equivalent contribution independence. i.e nothing. 

A person selling foreign propaganda lecturing relevance. Nice

LOL yeah okay b00tlicker. Must Soros Sanders funded propaganda na know what? Yes, yes indeed. Bottom line, making uncomfortable giving shot it, that's exactly kind sociopathic person want nurse family members' nurse. Also deaths increase ICUs full. PhD philosophy language, find extremely curious interesting...


Thanks!


(Must something wording... maybe word ""inherited""?) true, cloth masks shown reduce spread people wear clearly effective slowing spread whether spread droplet aerosol. precisely war healthcare practitioners sign for. job. always hope there's war service time, time around there's war. Prone position (facing down) vents, using vents later normal (based blood ox), increased use dexamethasone Well cost per day staying hospital stands bit, that’s like 10x even 15x anywhere else according linked article. Lol mutation known jts strain hitting Europe. Anyway......... count deaths right answer. Sounds like passing buck me. Nah, way viral evolution gets talked sub clearly obvious. Cries San Diegan. got hit LA Zonies super hard weekend. goal holocaust ***take lives***. goal masks ***save lives***.

Not intelligent people around. really need strict border. already many accounts Americans coming self quarantined say they're going Alaska go vacation.. let's deal crux - trying say okay sterilize minority group without permission? cunt people boycotting everything associated with? need remember people businesses help pandemic boycott life. lot cheaper long term track trace properly confront new clusters openness honesty. Overwhelmed hospitals new lock downs cost lot more. lot countries track trace well operating semi normal. deaths come believe it’s real? Wuhan, Brazil, Italy, New York City / devastating loss life? think time different? Texas Florida somehow immune it? Waited March declare pandemic.

When think word pandemic used why? Yeah Yeah, Weve news CZ. easter holidays. 


""People irresponsible! Expect huge covid spike 14 days! Nation wide tragedy making!""

Guess what, nothing happened all. Cases decline instead... No, lockdowns prevent hospital overflows. Unfortunately seems get fatter dumber passing day. likely evidence viral rna fecal matter infectious anymore. test detect broken fragments virus, surfaces . Usually virus breaks fast stops infectious still detected tests. 1. sterilizing - say permanent
2. immigrants missing point???
3. Really gonna argue israel ""west."" Really????
4. Giving Ethopian immigrants birth control without permission right line talking about. yeah keep minimizing it. considered locking doors? did. paper formally published researchers Wuhan entire family infected asymptomatic family member working healthcare, researchers wanted investigate carrier transmission methods/rates. 

This study highlighted virus's potential airborne transmission, also carriers could asymptomatic still spread virus others.

 follow study conducted researchers S. Korea also reached conclusion enforced first publication arrived conclusion airborne transmission asymptomatic carriers. one steals gubernatorial position trump doesn’t encourage wearing mask. mention article though? even read it? How? friend died young sure it’s numbers game fuck What's definition Health Care? Mental? Dental?

If want avoid Health Care, wear face mask properly, wash hands properly often (and use paper towel turn tap), social-distance distance well away others (properly), share things people get infected.

Don't even go social gatherings, fact go anywhere absolutely necessary.

How hard that??? I've done since late February, see complaining.

If above, AVOID need Health Care. Mental, well sorry - suck best can.

(Now show comment Scientist, see say know I'm talking about.) He’s entertainer. president lot answer since he’s president. still refuses wear mask  knew China Feb. ignoring facts like usual. seem like sub posts places pay walls? might guy surviving happily, dying aged 55 fucked organs. best friend finishing medic degree says still know shit exact consequences COVID survivors, links mildly damaged arteries, lungs kidneys.

New covid debilitations discovered weekly. affect ages. Germany here, 430 new cases 83m population countrywide numbers varying either steady decline. 

And pretty much everyone smh'ing wtf US doing. 


Masks work btw, fyi retarded governors. 
Being gay doesn’t put anyone else’s life risk. wearing mask does. US mantra well, except think Europe held longer. US home 30 days people lost mind.  r/COVID19 may good place start. certainly something it! Yet, considering daily, record-breaking amount new cases, would bigger underlying reason deaths proportionally surge couple weeks. sayin'. basically trespassing property owners dont want there. change anything though. virus always been. chances overwhelmingly won’t all. Winning Anti-stupid? airborne, leaving trail contaminated air behind you. accident get heart attack (from covid) infect save you. means virus unlikely airborne. plain bullshit, countries Sweden beginning. Sweden comparable, due cultural differences, US. 

Get shit together Reddit. I’ll give best case scenarios without road blocks.

- end research : August.
- end clinical trials: Oktober.
- end approval : December.
- end mass production: February
- end distribution: March Wait, border w US opened?!?! Stricter lockdowns ...which exactly counting dead bodies sufficient count death toll Covid thus post completely wrong. Come really obvious. Contagion soothing me. Terrorist groups sheltering within get ahold old Soviet era weapons, get supplied say North Korean agent? Dunno, money way. Paying exercise enclosed space lots people possible covid-19 infection vs going outside exercising free... nytimes mainstream eyes something? Right. sent measly $1200 last months big corporations got millions .... Anytown, USA Even live Aomori, time gone least 80% people wear masks. definitely 100% employees wear them. ""only"" 27 cases Aomori Prefecture. ~~headline~~ misleading.

This subreddit general. mostly armchair anaylysts who've ready one two summarized articles suddenly pandemic experts. percentage health care workers anti vaxx anti science shockingly large number couple Minnesota allow drive car Ontario? dont live Alaska border supposed closed I’m positive fucked Certain groups people assigned numbers here? can’t imagine reason this. /s It’s caused people taking precautions wonder experts needed even tell people that

I like think still need say regardless accountability event ""why warned"" claims. AC. known. mean they're serving food drink I'd hope would PPE? stand corrected. two months hardly connected Easter holidays, it.

Also second ""peak"" caused one isolated hotspot coal mine. Afaik came Poland spread there. contained quarantined. 

The called peak caused targetted testing miners, none actually required hospitalised. looks like peak, overall numbers low. Rest country absolutely fine.

We know happen national strategy keep testing, keep tracing deal possible hotspots allowing rest country live on. ridiculous. yell young girl wearing mask basically protect people. Even worse, buying something indulgent unnecessary ice cream. imagine entitled lard-asses now. It’s embarrassing many us living stereotype rest world sees Americans. 

If mask could - simple way reduce contagiousness disease. Instead it’s political statement.

I can’t imagine witnessing person handing beatdown. poor kids aren’t getting paid enough put nonsense. Cool, texas arizona payer pay full amount claim. 

Ever. Canada never lockdown we've re-opened restaurants, malls, etc without sort issues. way sure air getting changed out. airborne one person pretty much infect plane. Well guess done flying. Nothing ideal co-vid Trumps behavior this. slowly losing business one states highest infection rates right now. What's worse company works really close people homes. I've lost consumer confidence simply anyone get sick around people. people suck clients non mask wearing red necks. hear work people can't tell shut pro trump rhetoric. I'm close shutting opening new company less bullshit. dont understandvhow allowed country begin border closed would boss make money ?? raised bunch narcissists I'm sure help, either. Toronto Canada’s largest city 2.9 million people. people social distancing required wear masks, 2 hospitals zero patients Covid ICU. largely good leadership public cooperation. Ontario province 14.5 million people reported 165 new cases yesterday. Compare Florida population 21.5 million 11,445 new cases. saying… Ferrets US healthcare system biggest joke! means US screwed new treatments/vaccines developed elsewhere - may game changers. originally ""make Germany great again"" probably know sure historians, dozen years, manage get access declassified files. Wow almost like health insurance good idea That’s actual right beastie boys song. reason public health agencies emphasizing masks alone sufficient one main reasons hesitant recommend mass use masks first place. people think wearing cloth masks means they're protected virus may observe measures know effective: social distancing. can't get virus staying home. people stay home forever, stay home less catch spread virus. 

I understand reasons masks become politicized people think violating political ideology wear masks. guidance trying cheer lead masks political way. emphasizing fact wearing mask, beneficial, going prevent getting virus *also* observing important measure: distance. real fear people wearing masks, incorrect idea like perfect even highly effective protection, that. crazy. article says previous version story patient paying 4,000. seems like pretty reasonable amount. 

This insurance works. one seems understand that.

Like even article? nothing newsworthy leave Dan Patrick charge? thanks. much dislike Abbot (I supported Wendy Davis), least he’s shown he’ll ***eventually*** kind right thing i.e. mask order. Dan Patrick would kill grandparents mask order. Ohio it’s required. live 10 mins away PA border required there. work retail see lot customers getting masks. spent minute snapchats map feature last night let tell - numbers HUGE week America. People either don’t care, don’t believe aren’t scared. Depends location. buddy wife made parking lot hospital nurse came literally caught baby. went get Mommy baby checked everything ok. forced stay night let go $27000 bill.

My wife preeclampsia doctors caught months delivery (many second opinions agree) ended needing magnesium drip pressure cuffs legs. 3 days hospital, one day baby NICU got $57000 bill land months fighting insurance getting hospital code damn bill correctly. Woof. least got laugh us feel better bit? (Not snarky need every bit sunshine get) pandemic impact people biological preconditions and/or without behavioral self-control. 9 weeks real total chaos. Japan, also appears recent primary clusters contributing recent spike cases. crazy! thought person thought that! Since beginning I've walking around saying virus singing song. Well Minnesota couple caught Ontario? doesnt make sense, dont live Alaska, allowed drive Ontario? trial really shows might work partially funded Gilead? really inspire confidence Sort like causeway going Key West, 2400 miles shit. virus still needs hitch ride water droplet much smaller droplets called microdroplets. still makes difference microdroplets still much larger virus caught good facemasks (meltblown polypropylene.)

What mean ordinary cloth facemasks won’t offer protection wearer. it’s outrageously expensive Guardian reported cost US government US$3,200 six-day treatment. contrast, production costs remdesivir estimated 93 US cents one day’s treatment, less US$6 entire course

Dexamethasone cheap hell comparison, like said, actually helps reduce mortality Easy. 4000 pneumonia based deaths normal.

Its quite common pneumonia outbreak Texas Summer I'm hoping joke. Kim straight takes attractive women homes makes become slaves orgies. frequently puts people death firing squad, family members. sole reason country prospering like South; Kim dynasty allow interaction outside world. straight Orwellian dystopia controls every sort information receive. Trump looks like Saint compared Kim. wonder experts needed even tell people brunt I've seen many Millennials even zoomers wearing masks, wearing head nose. seems middle aged folks younger Millennials seem care least. truly terrifying scenario: reaches saturation, becomes like flu, lethal. Possible, yes, let's jump conclusions yet. ‘Crystal clear’ drunk people keep distance.

No shit Sherlock. what’s happening California then? pic looks similar nightclubs Australia re-opened last Friday Australia.

People listen. approval ratings 40's, way high remove now.  Even reporters denounce everything said this. 600k tests country 129 million ...... probably surprising. remember exactly epidemiologists said specific evidence masks general population ""There specific evidence suggest wearing masks mass population potential benefit. fact, there's evidence suggest opposite misuse wearing mask properly fitting properly,"" Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director health emergencies program, said media briefing Geneva, Switzerland, lot. teacher, I'd quit. stackable? One antiviral steroid. Sounds promising ignorant ol’ me- one knocks viral load, beefs systems overcome remaining virus?

If one works some, works better, could tolerate both, perhaps combo great. 

Also i’m desperate lonely :( even then, store wants refuse admission people showing naked shoulders, knees hair, could. It'd stupid profit, yeah Yeah, everyone gets tested upon arrival airport, one turned positive isolation. Business? Try schools. Wide open..... 

Oh man anyone 65 luck.... people need hospital beds, harder deliver quality care,” Nuzzo says. “And clinical workers working nonstop really long latest run medical centers may potentially increase mortality rates age groups. means, says Scott UT Austin, it’s likely matter time death rate begins rise rapidly.

I hope WRONG, fear not. Point Yes, can. walk side away people swap out. Downright frightening:

""The United States infections virus-related deaths world, 2.8 million cases nearly 130,000 dead, according university. Experts say true toll pandemic significantly higher, due people died tested missed mild cases.

Worldwide, nearly 11.3 million people infected 531,000 died, outbreaks India, South Africa, Pakistan, Brazil several Latin American countries."" worry though, go ahead hold anniversary party parents. kills people, you. special. ... hell ""mortgaging entire future"" for? Deaths would go older/ risk people getting infected, seems like majority infections right among younger people going bars restaurants. wait start infecting older parents coworkers. http://archive.is/a8N3M Yeah, like stay hospital week observation would enough. Add breathing tubes blammo! Lives destroyed. ""Freedom"" Look people throwing mask tantrums. Oh, fellow parent presume. I've seen 638 times :) Still love movie though. normal people isn’t expensive, since insurance, many people irresponsible country don’t want insurance rather vacation somewhere else. Yeah India poor compared US 3 - 4 times higher population density. Healthcare system fail. many people freaking people wearing masks? There's much info explaining help even paranoid, f$&amp;k cares? people freaking people paranoid far paranoid virus government conspiracy! angry paranoia, go yell mirror. Damn, humans effing disappointingly stupid. imported? trying restrict PPE honest N95 cut it?

Wouldn't ironic. Either way right.

Masks course help n100 eye protection (not shield) would required protect person. 

And completely impracticable. Complete morons! drinkers authorities believing people behave sensibly. learn countries first wave learn US spikes, fully expect end month shit show. No, Ohioans like this. They're midwestern get-- put head down, work, potluck type people-- bet today tons people go ice cream shop leave big tips even disagree mask wearing. tell Hillary Duff!

Lets make 2020 year finally put Hillary White House! Kanye/Duff 2020!!! false, Black Death disproportionately killed poor, driving cost labor, creating middle class Europe. want go *cries* Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* lol imagine celebrating country time like this. Ashamed society. Essential, still subject 14 day quarantine. LOL....so true. legal Hawaii? show superior society, Chile tell people wear masks host parties host huge parties without masks... fucked. Airliners actually replace cabin air every 5 minutes. ""sealed"" many people think. Still, air inside swirling around quite bit, air wafts along could carry droplets across rows. caught this, almost died it....and making good recovery decided “let ‘er rip”?!

Does admit receiving convalescent plasma no? Simple, kids. bad kidney disease eventually I'll die since insurance. Blithering idiot. think compared rest world, Americans least risk averse. attitude takes us lot great places (like putting men moon), obviously leads us lot shitty ones well. don’t want downplay virus anything think it’s also important note death toll isn’t going up. Cases rising gradually deaths haven’t. know ppl say deaths lag behind fact still stagnant least say something. 265 recorded deaths yesterday 616 day that. want everyone remember virus isn’t death sentence although still deadly, least aren’t seeing 2,500+ deaths per day like saw April. I’m still hopeful things getting better. certainly. Judging current numbers projections spread USA, seems like guys really need get. 500k doses much all, far ideal that's producers' full production capacity husband’s coworker one first people department get COVID. almost died it. Still won’t wear mask. mean, sure masks work great use culturally ingrained Japan...but already forgotten report last month?

[Over half Japan pathologists' requests postmortem coronavirus tests rejected: Nah, math off. talking 25% potentially anti-vaxxers. calculated 25% Americans get infected, could also expect 25% anti-vaxxers infected, 100% them. Right on, thread someone posting Fauci 60 minutes, hence said so. Also CDC / surgeon general fall right federal umbrella (Trump admin) we're already shortage ppe fed sold equipment masks china.

Fauci right feds control. That's outspoken surgeon general CDC. 

This goes back fed, matter look it. boards talk school. AZ also world, wiped things come back. many idiots.. Let's put analogy contract employer writing up. agree even written, let alone read? No? really refusing sign, healthy scepticism? I'm suburbs staying away city. bars reopened capacity limits. preliminary things I've seen news owners good things, that's probably City patrolling areas told everyone shut establishments follow rules. I’m swfl university sent everyone email week ago saying schools florida plan open possibly close thanksgiving planning well. Enough time everyone pay tuition get past drop refund date - back lockdown. Yes, bringing home. Separate bedroom/bath. spend time garage playing video games. Common-areas restricted-use 14 days. Every time see word 'record' sub, inexplicably make woo-sound.. that's particularly good thing. Even headline moronic. 

When last, states spiking states believe science thing. 

This time, much. college, students chose defer wait year though. least choice. teach elementary school. lower K-12 bathe germs going horrific. don’t get PPE littles can’t reasonably consistent keeping mask on. parents screaming need childcare. Apparently primary responsibility? WTF. that's understand. Anyone go woth extensive amounts schooling able sort information inaccurate false better average population. Hell three years grad school (to become Spanish teacher) one main focuses research find credible sources. strategy want rethink? anybody see it? don’t think any. find nasopharyngeal test? CVS swab Right??! wonder yeah will. old people taking seriously. cases surging cause young/middle aged people redneck areas never wear masks going report it? teacher, worries me. CDC? Doctors office? required report this? Again, I’m sure expect happen. 

So say want vaccinate family Arkansas, come vaccinate them, say no, attempt detain them, say no.

What’s next? would love see screenshot that. Southern Oregon pretty good I’d say. incredibly hyperbolic. wild failure.. least pay fine able afford now.. 1 thing trump liked... still got 300$ month something can't even use unless I'm basically dying. Guess people Florida want die. makes, common sense, life. know numbers seem small compared Texas/Florida; Idaho's total population 1.8 Million. Also getting test Idaho difficult. 

Basically Idaho like small towns Texas/Arizona... except Boise wants like Seattle. yeah bad. know, san antonio everyone masking like soon got car, older heavyset ladies like hoofing target 100 degree heat humidity, n94... come on, one administration could find way spin “freedom masks” ?!? people either slower even imagine else malicious intent. dont know believe. right feel like im abusive relationship, government... think time even China thought Virus came China scientists saying might case  I've learned always need /s. Nothing fuck ton gasoline match fit. Also joking. They’re also going testing students. go college UNC system they’ve said don’t get tested returning campus INSANE. also probable COVID case- reason say probable doctor believes reason tested negative university healthcare center got tested swab properly. idea they’ve fixed it. 

Oh added clause on-campus housing agreement refunds given residence halls shut again. It’s bullshit. also promised change classes larger rooms move online. right now, mine changed way whatsoever... Yes, measles airborne disease. Part reason dangerous.

COVID seems average aerosol transmission properties, still airborne. And...? bad idea hang it! People nasty! wait year vaccine made public use?

At least 6 months, year seems long enough tens millions people report side effects know risks I'm taking. ok staying quarantine then. would venture guess Americans average far less healthy Canadians general.

I wonder hospital deaths covid comparison places. Oxford scientist random redditor


Sorry bud, think we're going guy far over, agree. milestone nonetheless far cry almost 250 deaths one day months ago. live midtown Detroit agree saying initial response. course lot assumptions baked numbers. 10 1 biggest estimate NYC antibody numbers validated ratio.

I’m constantly trying figure partial herd kicks - 40 percent enough slow things down, looking Q1 2021.

If cases go 20000-25000, doubles time. start cranking 100,000 confirmed cases day, things speed up. Either way it’s huge amount disease death. dumb comment. loose regulations believe vaccine soon kills people. Plan worse case scenario, going take long time deliver vaccine country large India. Perfect. may ask social distancing, respecting one another lock down, staying crowded areas etc? question originally asked answered map...it gives 0 data that, often people physically moved around last months Tampa like bombing Dresden last night. So.very.fucked. yeah... someone ordered testing reduced 2.5 million cases someone who's going tell world there's virus going around anyone else knows.

As far awkward goes, nothing compared awkward it'd world figures he's projection century attacking China.

He probably know there'd genetic evidence left behind. mean US may things drastic suppressing information. issue national security id assume justify thing. now. gotta deal it. It’s crazy sad played country. Personally, went beach July 4th weekend. stayed group 8 people 4 live didn’t interact anybody else. Went home barbecue. 



We outdoor activities fucking social distance people don’t know don’t go bars/restaurants packed. went restaurant last week 50% capacity. Everyone 6ft apart lovely meal. 



Other countries able shit can’t we? Correct. hallmarks Russian / GOP disinformation it. Administration? Oh *our* meetings online. need us travel Zoom! main thing they've (at least, appears digging data) fudging % positive numbers, make appear testing adequate is.  Americans would agree,

Link? Every poll ive seen shows youre minority selfish pricks. article never gave source prove actually Corona prove numbers. Everybody knew supposed limited numbers supposed social distance.

Can blame selfish ignoring recommended guidlines, instead going home somewhere else less crowded.

Abso-f*cking-lutely... Day 49 said anything killing them? never going 0. drive, car crash kill people, eat bad food, heart disease kill people. attitude toward whole thing. virus extremely virulent attacking body violently. Older people, people underlying condition people weak immune system one risk. inching category. role incident response. hacker/ransomware/virus breaches network call me. First thing disconnect internet (Shutdown border) traffic allowed out. asses damage (We find obviously infected) clean it. scan rest network (test everyone exceptions) slowly re-open department based business needed make money (phased re-opening). whole time monitor entire network find 1 infection shutdown internet again. That's attitude toward handled. Obviously/unfortunately can't that. 

So 8 active cases known locations far concern acceptable risk. Yes someone hotspot drive quarantine 14 days ruin everyone else. Yes someone go gas station buy milk wear mask get infected. People risk stay home people healthy take precautions go out. Thank you, St_Bernardus, voting AutoModerator.

I like Xi Pooh originally came power wave discontent botched SARS response. 

Wrong, Xi became paramount leader dispatching Bo Xilai left Shanghai clique right secure almost failed initial hush rather late response... rather redeemed. Especially compared certain countries leaders.

The intiial coverup Hubei Wuhan officials, got purged national leadership soon became clear week January 20th Wuhan Hubei going fairly authoritarian state pull something like off. 

The QR code forced masking part solution South Korea Guess they'll actually pay someone stead using slave labor. Boo hoo, woe Yeah think measles capable traveling airborne transmissibility factor way higher COVID19  can’t expect people get abortion think it’s correct thing do. BC fails pandemic think it’s selfish someone wouldn’t want abort baby? Fucks sake. One take away estimate may getting good detecting cases. least relatively. Apparently not. Maybe next generation... feel shame. No, all. One screen, two movies. someone warned them... oh wait.  376 yesterday.  Lol poor people willing travel India excuse. actually cerified idiot? so, take easy you. people ago say lockdown destroy wear masks? Thanks addition! fun! think guys would crazy open border big stupid neighbor right now. Enjoy you’ve got—or, case, don’t have. Like maybe take seriously? Close things back down. Enforce mask mandate.

I wonder that's part problem -- complete dingleberry public there's repercussions, social legal. thought too, especially holiday weekend. know Michigan, counties major states reported since Thursday due holiday closures. Yes own. Wants public know truth. Yes, seven hours vehicle risky separate bedroom, eating separately, wearing masks common areas 14 days. testing appointments available SF July 14.  actual working vaccine right now? I'm non-union tenured professor, and, joke, unionized adjuncts better job protection lot ways. example, university dictated full-time professors teach partially person fall semester, there's real way us challenge that. adjuncts unionized, negotiate memorandum understanding them. show teach person, fired breach contract. Sure, could hypothetically challenge that, I'd hire lawyer, would ton time money, etc., etc. 

A lot universities going business right now, ones mostly hiring freezes. going end road lot academics, many coworkers (tenured non-tenured) terrified getting fired. need define “miserable” first. mean word? hope don’t need explain tiny percentage people spread rapidly fast. That’s kind world calling pandemic Anything support rhetoric huh. Women almost always get saddled child care responsibilities; could literally throw millions women work force Pride # got used, wasnt tons know people worked patients. IcUs also surged; 2 people per room etc.

We sre beginning phase 3 week. ~200 new cases day right began opening mid may. Bars nightclubs closed indefinitely dance floors weddings. weddings, gyns open, indoor dining, movie theaters, etc think capacity limits. Well eum sounds like recipe disaster. students :/ Least got little money making unemployment work 5 days week trailers lifting bending packages towards 250 pounds posted several times today already.

Just keep mind actual number total infections minimally 5x number based latest projected mortality rates.

So freak 200k, model shows 1.4 million total infections state Florida. (So 7x officially reported)

Make it. That's labs burned China....🤔🤔.. people went missing alert anyone...🤔🤔 still get virus. It’s almost move food plates wash hands after. God damn man I’m scared virus people like it’s like WANT believe every bit bad news something mad about. planning licking bag something fuck? Police paid enforce laws blatantly brazenly cherry picking laws choose enforce since like zero oversight? Yeah, definitely seems level confidence northern states i'm sure have. Hopefully plan place cases start rise again, inevitable. South done, slowing obvious cases rising quickly weeks ago abhorrent tho. Closing bars mandating face masks two things universal across states. become pretty clear bars particular huge breeding grounds transmission. worry people taking away this: “Other countries fine!” Rather “other countries watch US great interest don’t make reopening mistakes.” Unless you’ve eliminated COVID, bars fantastic vector quickly reverse progress you’ve made. don’t eat drink. fast. Can’t risk going bathroom. toilet plume infectious, too. How? It’s crisis, bad stuff going happen. That’s reality. could use billions saved allowing people contribute economy hire workers/increase pay healthcare. Hell, could build whole new healthcare system amount money lockdowns cost. DAMN FAULT heard before? C19’s real disruptor, eh? disrupts many systems body scientists keep finding new ones new ways — body politic 😣   Really side-eyeing southern border right now...... Vote who? Biden said veto M4A Im sure Trump would same. racist lol mean impossible wear mask eating. go eating anywhere, food drink arrives can't much. long tables distance them, there's much else do. Would hope mask wearing least interacting servers, unfortunately people that

I definitely condone park party like many people. Beaches iffy. sun, long keep distance people think huge problem, walk up/boardwalk bars masks cause real problem beaches. small beach everybody crowded top ideally wear mask.

Indoor activities without masks still main cause spread. much trying restrain outdoor activities still reopen. much damn testing anymore hospitalizations DUH.

/s # small percentage seem exist country though. kind anti-mask shit simply happening anywhere United States. attend work college University System Georgia, allow state emphatically: care lives. 

Just past week FINALLY started mandating masks indoors University vehicles. We've riding together trucks since beginning epidemic considered essential workers. little support given allowing position back chose work due concerns COVID. 

They established program provided fraction pay stay home limited amount time qualified, meeting strenuous requirements regarding age lifestyle factors regularly interact someone demographic risk contracting virus. cannot afford luxury simply working. Management offers sympathies form claiming care us, classes soon starting begin enforcing protective measures.

I cannot stress point enough: colleges care money. businesses. simply WAY maintain social distancing guidelines many students can't even employees. management trouble abiding rules enforce frequently wear masks inside buildings.

They sent email detailing plans proceed in-building classes courses. They're opening dorms well. going see hotbed new cases students come back various locations undoubtedly bringing infections putting others risk. *(The comment Kapoffa got deleted, I'll post reply anyway since took time write it, plus links.)*

Norway opened high schools May 11 way, Sweden waited till June 15. [VGs awesome contains timeline restrictions. Way many factoids getting copied around.

Amusement parks bars open since June 1 Norway, soccer league misc. stuff like water parks since June 15. 200 people allowed gather since June 15 well. Basically, neighbors open open us now, likely remain throughout summer, simultaneously avoiding thousands deaths.

In case wondering cases exploded, disease effectively suppressed though [contact (which much phone apps, used eradicate smallpox). think would effective is, [misjudged graphs [look like Finland's [like hard think ""pros"" point, even put people die viruses separate mental category people die stuff start hardcore rationalizing. healthy diet makes healthier??? WHAT? Exactly! Say it! Agreed. Bats sprouting nonsense. Remember cruise ship Trump want dock ""basically zero"" cases? Damn feels like long time ago. company actually gets location data without ability opt phone service provider. government wants access it, get court order make company give up. think so. Europe parts Asia got cases control well within time frame SIP. rate would taken 7-8 months (that's guess, based May-June looked like) get control. examples needed 4-6 weeks get control...I think anyone would SIP again. blame them, I've lucky can't imagine small business owner shut again. basically asking people kill livelihoods. worries I'm talking Fauci, I'm talking health officials warned Americans prepare spread novel coronavirus U.S., people shouldn’t wear face masks prevent spread infectious illness, according Centers Disease Control Prevention, U.S. Department Health Human Services U.S. surgeon March 2nd. Masks new normal out. coronavirus possibility new types viruses emerging well. 

It's norm Asia awhile. exactly need see stranger's face anyways? ""Giving privacy"" Google information yet lol

All app tracks proximity devices SHIT looks like suffering kind psychological disorder. bet someone study showing rates personality disorders amongst non-maskers vs maskers, rate would much higher amongst anti-maskers. # fly blue angels them, make feel better. Whoa. current central Florida LPN currently quarantined, we're fucked. [genetic already pretty self evident known while. Wuhan's Type B strain never spread much beyond China, current Type C strain D614G mutation found China latest Beijing outbreak.

The fact common ancestor types, Type A, found highest numbers US also tells something, research gets shut pretty quick, data classified leak FBI

Still say I'm surprised Oxford balls talk this, geopolitical ramifications going rabbit hole catastrophic. protests country, evidence amount people participating protests given region correlates much positive rate grew area? first glance, looks like cases going fastest Florida, Texas, California, Arizona. areas remember biggest protests, except California maybe (NYC, Minnesota, Georgia, DC biggest protests, yet cases either going shooting like crazy states). looks like cause lack mask wearing, open bars restaurants, increase vacation travel unnecessary social interaction. 

It's peak summer now, people visiting family, going drinks, going beach, especially young people warm southern/western states.

Protests obviously help, understand, indoor spread far likely, especially people indoors wearing masks like bar restaurant. took june advise non healthcare workers also wear mask Friday would higher LA Texas counties reported like usual. Saturday much lower 4th. Today looks like higher last week least similar. Tuesday typically catch day weekend deaths. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* That's countries. think everyone expectation parents' generation left almost one scarred. 

Less generation, still scarred. heard anecdotes internet girls boys second parent, always part larger abuse unstable parenting. 

I see worse asking child pitch basic chores. sweeping floor admirable singing song cheer one-year-old mom showers? know one I'd pick every time. Holy shit. She’s completely insane. Scotland--we're starting open shops etc. back up, masks become compulsory tenth. They're important stage people start mingling more. Safer mean absolutely risk free, I'm saying. I've tried getting front page multiple times across alts never gets anywhere. trying better part year. report drivers wearing masks cancel without penalty. 

Drivers required wear almost 3 months now. Metro Detroiter here. perspective - March frustrated delaying inevitable locking surrounding states taking lead. She’s done good job since (aside husband trying name drop get boat water anyone else). She’s definitely leveraged political career moniker Trump. 

This state/area woods yet. Lakes parks packed weekend. I’m 30s, people know loose, feel like it’s over.

Good job far, we’ll see. cases rising. Church assume? There's extra Medicare mean health insurers offering extra compensation legislated Medicare patients obviously guy since healthcare worker Medicare patient.

Secondly reason 20% extra need PPE extra testing fact hospitals acquire equipment onslaught patients. passed 20% extra cover PPE become outrageously expensive hospitals could actually acquire it. thing ventilators one things people realize addition ventilators patients need extensive monitoring amount drugs put intravenously requires complex amount equipment, cases hospital adequate amount simply something would need quantity normal times. Came say exactly flint still clean water perhaps slowing reduce fear, knows really research shows every case confirm testing, 10 cases. US ~30 million cases far.

We running 50,000 tested cases day, estimate probably infecting 500.000 people day.

330 million x .25 = 82.5 million

82.5 million - 30 million = 52.5 million.

52.5 million / 500,000 = 105 days

Just Columbus Day, probably early vaccine 2-3 months. make good news stories though, people prefer constant terror. Tampa another bergamo like NYC was. much needless suffering old news, remember reading exact things like month ago really going make lot people realize 90% jobs people offices arent really needed need far less physical time.

This interesting effect society. Didnt tell everyone stay home sick unless absolutely necessary go hospital? COVID fine. two inhalers. nodules lungs. blocked alveoli. can't walk couple blocks without sit pant. 

Maybe need relax little less. i'd gone trolling alright make sense, thanks answering question.   whole anti-mask movement masterpiece Russian social media misinformation, Americans fucking stupid? Oh again. one says current trajectory shows USA dealing pandemic perfectly. Go fun then, knock out. akin playing busy street. Stay safe! Ahh, daily visit well-known troll comments83820. let's see kind trouble he's trying stir today... hope vaccine. Dont people insurance? ever happened guys Obamacare? perhaps aberration (although ""pretty par with"" somewhat understatement), many colleagues make grotesque salaries, even routinely send patients collections medical bills sue them. fuck der b. Half panic half chillin like hoax worst part deepens social divide haves have-nots. husband could live house entirely never go to. trust me, that's feels like since beginning March Northern Virginia. point is, job quickly easily switched work home, given I'm infrastructure provider I've busy crap. mainly dealing increased demand systems accommodate people moved work home. order Amazon, use instacart Amazon fresh, use chewy online pet pharmacies pets, name it. afford that.

My adult son however, manager gym. wife office manager medical practice. option work home, income high enough order everything online delivered, story countless service workers area.

When people refuse wear masks, putting people really option great risk. one house neighborhood owned non-profit specifically designed rent low-income people give opportunity build savings children go better schools. family lived month ago single mother three children. works one local grocery stores. stayed open throughout entire shutdown, would frequently comment callousness people complaining wearing mask got angry. people putting risk every time every day.

Where f****** mask people. infringement personal freedoms. can't go barefoot grocery store, never could. never saw widespread protests practice shoe wearing grocery store! countless examples like this. rules participate civilized society, rules never seen infringements upon freedom masks became widely politicized. never got first stimulus check. also qualify unemployment since working university student at. Easy karma already flattening out. Look 7 day average. dropping fast used to, almost hitting inflection point flatten turn back again.

But, reasons include:

* testing now, even though confirmed cases significantly, true infected patients probably high first peak (yet)
* evident hospitalization data, near 1st peak hospitalizations. trending trends look good, still 1st peak. Hospitalizations impacted testing, better metric track.
* IFR dropped since start pandemic due better treatments, better hospital preparations, better protections vulnerable people. I've seen top epidemiologists believe IFR around 0.8-1% 1st peak, slowly dropping around 0.4-0.5% now. even number hospitalizations, wont see number deaths 1st peak, due lower IFR. order deaths levels 1st peak, hospitalizations probably need around double 1st peak. Math. 115 days equal 3 months . Change statement I’ll argue post facts . far know insurance companies policies covering it. that's federal government committed paying well. knows happen later? mean guess. done anything control corona? Like anything all? would bet reality numbers worse. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. long gonna play corona originated Europe pretend game? evidentemente dollari americani non sono vettore di covid, gli euro lombardi sì.

sigh. Climate change denial site looking page hits Thanks taking time share it! science pretty clear since February. That's breakthrough kind. value reinforcing understand public including outdoors safER safe.

The fundamental flaw addressing letter WHO. merely spectator COVID-19. leaders science medicine. needs massive overhaul starting DG. Basically, liquid gas. Atomised particles linger air several hours. really state evidence facemasks prevented transmission coronavirus. say early recommend people wear masks unless sick. ignorant statement Agreed. idea Rogan hated act Stewart. cop out. Yeah wondering fucking us. Comparing virus fighting WW1 absurd idk made people upset. Freedumb, like But. has. pay attention all?? year olds kids

When 16, worry 16 year olds, actually pretty awful. Can't imagine much would suck adults acting like 16 year olds too. wouldn’t want live simply poor employment rights healthcare system. It’s propaganda it’s state nation. New York City, Long Island, Massachusetts impressed level mask wearing social distancing witnessed locations, disagree “most usa people super selfish” remark. think Americans may selfish terms money wellbeing, witnessed much terms virus. Maybe city/state, haven’t seen much all. Kennedy, Washington, John Adams, Coolidge &lt;3 Kim Jong un disappeared awhile, came back, know replaced body double Guys, anyone want tell car carrying ships? seek therapy bigot 👏🏼 And? Easter holidays around 12th April, see 25th April daily cases active cases numbers still dropping despite excessive testings... Amen autistic folks rely home delivery like months sensory issues masks, yeah, Karen needs go store coworkers yesterday going “unhealthy,” go party friends family weekend. None went masks last night. knew saw car family watched fireworks. doomed guy, same. 100%. Japan blew mind 16 days. much better handling pandemic. find soon enough 20K day states next week. Nope, go debt can't pay credit score ruined harder keep roof newborn's head. story three days ago could made difference? really yputh. go time getting tested unlike february. Boris Johnson Either don’t go do. point you’re probably going convince convince you. you’re eating outside tables distanced it’s probably fine. Maybe plan spot staff wearing masks otherwise it’s probably fine  Well, there's new player virus... 3 9 times contagious, deadlier far tell, yet. Planes worst, recycle air filters catch virus. buildings - airborne theory true, might necessary upgrade many. Seriously, need remember every politician, every business, every person help pandemic. need vote office, boycott them, cancel them. willing kill you. deserve mercy. 95% confidence interval 0.01 0.94. effect could easily chance real effect HCQ. Ya'll keep raising number. Seriously. kid's orthodontist signs like these, lock doors. Waiting car appointment done, see people walk door, try open locked door, look around GIANT ORANGE SIGNS telling do. daughter one units. home now, benefits kicked in. Call J.G. Resign! headline misleading. We’ve always known coronavirus travels microdroplets. term “airborne” suggests virus passed floating infectious. case. makes huge difference. Microdroplets blocked good meltblown polypropylene mask. virus alone harder block. Jesus fucking christ, fuck americans able afford shitting kids? sitting piles money something? look discussions. study using confirmed deaths - seems relying solely CDC data regularly updated.  


A True IFR (which virus seems pointless look hold since affects different age cohorts differently) determined autopsy virus done get past it.  


With said 0.5% 1% seems much consensus lies. don’t need bachelors degree RN least state. bachelors degree would RN BSN. believe local healthcare system likes BSN going management, it’s required front line nurses. also know nurse won’t wear mask grocery store. wearing 10 hours, sick it. hospitals choose life healthier persons lack space?

Didn't actually happen places? Cruise ships fucking disgusting places hygienically, countless outbreaks manner diseases years, perfect incubators. small cramped spaces ideal spread anything trying test trace make sense outbreak extremely difficult. surfaces cruise ships especially tight areas would covered particles air results always skewed. use app called speech assistant cases. artificial voice course help, showing text does. thing something possible happening much. one main conflicts scientific debate right now. example, scientists saying found airborn lab conditions real world cases (e.g., choir super spreading event). looking actual transmission rates, epidemiological mapping contact tracing, appears like happening majority cases. question respond information. Using precautionary principle, assuming worst, economic, social, human consequences may result worse outcomes. public health easy always assuming acting potential worst case. There's balance struck. And, taking hydrocychloroquine far less likely contract Covid-19. TIL, thanks US mess. Canadian, tell you, living fear. ***Being intelligent right things ""living fear""***. Canada, living fear..........but things told medical experts, minimum fuss. Masks make big difference, people reject idea must struggle otter simple concepts life daily basis. said back March, got downvoted heavily scoffed at. scientifically published... anybody pay attention avoid going unless absolutely necessary, social-distance properly wear face mask properly? really hope so... yet still happening across Europe withany countries 1M distancing.  It’s literally job. Going right 7-11. older guy 60s working us little hearing impared may seem like he's yelling, really trying make sure hear he's saying. 

These people fucking unreasonable. people believe masks also believe healthcare country problem. Lots going get big surprises fronts Well, that’s great.

Right, sub takes bruise turns broken leg. course wrong, however remember China saying creditable evidence spreads person person. thousands people sick.  hearing phrase many times. ANTICOAGULENT PROTOCOLS. also monitoring blood sugar.

We started treating viral pneumonia. increasingly observing behaving like blood disease, lot massive clotting taking place. Also people presenting massively diabetic previously - previously unknown systemic symptoms likely caused lot early deaths becasuse realize killing them, busy trying force oxygen them... world went full crazy friend.

Federal leadership, state leadership, hospitals, citizens. lot people right thing completely ruined seemingly equal number people selfish jerks. 

It's like firefighter risking safety save arsonists burning building. Kim sense Trump

Ignoring it’s 4 months since start meaning Florida better prepared Florida’s problem didn’t go lockdown. 

This point. Create crisis. ‘Solve’ remind everyone states they’d dead without ignoring fault begin with. Off-topic.. saw MMR COVID sentence thought.. wait.. get covid gaming??? I'm screwed... =/ Weird mention Tampa General, largest county. virus ripped lot long term care facilities first; surprisingly caused lot deaths.

This bad fucking virus seems spring new surprises us regular basis. around months. We're working bit dark trying figure best way handle it. Hang there. smiley sufficient me. Well, perhaps, stop listening simpletons conducting public policy?

Don't want wear mask, fine, heres hefty fine, oh pay? Here's jail cell.

We mandatory limits murder, rape, indecent exposure, spreading lethal pandemic cool? No. gives fuck yokels yell online. Literally, care? Unverified account #2 says masks nothing, maybe consider opinion? No.

Mask sit jail. I'm tired asf sitting house absolutely zero fucks left people choose ignore this. COURSE Scottsdale know many beds hospitals have? 20% could big difference number beds hospitals. I’m legitimately curious Anecdotally know several people weeks symptoms recurring fever, fatigue persistent caugh, loss smell/taste - basically whole list textbook COVID symptoms.

Then tested negative antibodies. don’t know believe now.  madness over, sure. then, sorry No. really want keep virus check much humanly possible.

But come up, sure. Bring Sam Adams Boston Lager, we'll send back selection Ontario's better craft beers. ☺ Minnesota - 500 daily cases

Yes, indeed possibility old viruses released ice permafrost melting. Climate change quite time bomb many levels :( accrual numbers, quantity percentage? talking 10 beds 100? Genuinely curious like 40 years

Does mean YS stuck ? never able change ? never able change ? Oxford dragging feet seems.

or actually trying test it?? Trumpets. really hasn’t hit yet bad get. People going die streets understand, areas may far from.

Hospitals reaching 100% ICU capacity goal post moved “Well 20% COVID.”

Then explain ICUs usually 65-70% capacity becomes “Well deaths haven’t gone yet.”

Then explain typically takes 1-2 weeks usually someone contracts disease die becomes “Well that’s happens everyone protesting.”

The party personal responsibility desperate make sure blame placed them. acknowledge freedom, duties. Oh man. Thats good :/ Major Plague Baseball like it. lmfao get fucked hillbillies usa unitl recent changing classifying death sin states. it’s possible infection would worse his, might get coughed once, you’ll inhaling infected snores night Ah, nevertheless ....look man. I'm guys. issue people guys, personal preference. Like it’s summer Olympics... article says takes half hour sunlight kill 90% sample. dedicated UV disinfecting lamp kill couple encouraged everyone go travel enjoy March break alot us thought fucked

Ever since then, he's absolutely solid I'm aware. wondering would say outright tho dont like strategy think public health agencys handling steeped incompetency stubbornness,

I however think little limited insight whats going ground Sweden. reason ”suddenly” could tripple testing Swedish government decided abruptly ramp testing. really wanted to, political opposition put lot preassure so. 

Region Västra Götaland one first really capacity? depends hard run article: ”Helt utan förvarning, sent måndag eftermiddag 1/6, började det välla kopiösa mängder prov, utöver den oerhörda mängd prov vi redan hanterar varje dag"", berättar Marie Karlsson bloggen. ""Mina kollegor och jag mår dåligt psykiskt och fysiskt och vet inte riktigt vart detta ska sluta för oss själva som människor. Vi sliter tills vi bryter ihop av utmattning"", skriver hon.”

Now forced roll back testing summer region make people work hours week, really need vacation. region Stockholm though, getting test next day isn’t issue.

The criteria refrering indeed changed. capacity isn’t regions. Trust me, didn’t capacity first months. single word swedish debate uttered us using capacity cover true case load up. whole debate hell unprepared couldnt scale testing earlier. Questions raised dependant non domestic reagents lacking tests seem lack coherent test, trace isolate strategy. one biggest political issues pandemic Sweden, really typical cover up, right?

Now considering argument immunity. Yeah, think might pretty close truth that. never thought could supress virus many nations rolled dice mind. Thats horrible wish like grown nordic neighbouring countries. Luckily election last fall flipped camera wished COVID-2019 everyone. Corey Hannon malicious. Oh hey, it's... *checks notes*...exactly thing said would happen trying avoid. 

Glad live florida... Boy BYE 👋🏼 Unfortunately ignorant Everybody think trump control 🤣😂🤣😂😂 he's puppet secret society group Canadian hospitals get money classifying patient covid patient vs illness.

You must realize Us hospitals get direct large payments US government classify one ICU covid. hospitals nearly bankrupt. kinds hospital insider stories saying forced report patients covid cases ICU. never said need lockdown ai actually believe opposite virus worse people think. yeah agree probably get lot worse soon winter many poeple die. may mutate lethal brazil hope doesnt. think worldometers said lot states reporting July 4 excuses wearing mask bogus. work (at desk) mask 8 hrs day issues breathing it. Saying wear mask global pandemic like saying accept CPR stranger *dying*, want catch germs. No. aren't. $$$... countries seem gotten rid wat ure saying he's confusing americans College campuses like large enclosed bars. could go wrong? useful diagnostic! Yes true places report numbers weekends. However still first ZERO deaths definitely thing happy about. They’re taking Mickey... would submit good portion people contracting think so. Famous last words, ""I'm clean"". easy. plane arrives Florida, passengers get taken straight hotel armed guards make sure leave. What's hard track? plane'd passengers taken hotel? Clearly havn't following top 100. 'Musical talent' longer required. ""Face masks oppress freedom"" says opressing peoples freedom wear masks. early. less 1%, got it. Oh also less 1% die it. 1% 1%. keep going serious is. bet lot colleges go online classes soon deadline get refund dropped courses passes people touch stove realize it’s hot. noted data July 4. Still seems low. country starts taking basic precautions cant start working complicated problem- right cant even lock outbreak areas, contact trace, even get 30% country wear cloth face. 

The virus spreading like wildfire know works- spreading know works decided care Weird, work home actually to, I’m school set back don’t shit Swedish media often does: twist story appear positive towards Swedish strategy actually is.

Huh, that's funny. Swedish news I've seen sub, situation's kinda complete reverse that. schools, schools....smh. There's barely money buy Lysol. Next month watch happens kids go back. also sucks people really good courses online, tried years failed miserably, quickly realized chance hell passing courses take person.  point ignorance refusing learn basics science &amp; math time adulthood count? global pandemic scale assuredly changes bit toward sociopathic....


Sociopath: person personality disorder manifesting extreme antisocial attitudes behavior lack conscience. cause mortality whole country 30000 plus confirmed deaths. true. One guy smoking near beach probably get noticed. restaurant choking . Polio 99% survival rate, including permanent paralysis 1%.

It bad enough developed vaccine, went great lengths eradicate it, we've largely done.

I get people think 99% survival rate good. awful. think that's true dude. 
You can't go jail debt. ruin credit take assets. 
Unless debt criminal offense. 
If thousands medical debt can't pay back, option might pay ruin credit. that. Aren’t lot Houston ICUs already 100% capacity staff that’s way overworked? know least based recent articles/vids think we're saying thing. Least amount cases since June 30th good though. Keeping casinos open closing beaches, starters  kind thinking hear time colleagues. exact reason screwed. agree easy sneak you, think shutting hard, think know much Spain. people told to, actually north week, will. That's 100% mask compliance 90% even mandatory. leat Cap show us way essentially, even everyone wearing mask , covid still spread. Healthcare worker here.
It's bad. called hero (and friends get sick maybe worse know even laid hours cut. amazing able pay mortgage using Hero Credit!!). might get discount Lunch somewhere, really lucky ones get lunch brought you. get lots rah rah administration including posters reminding hero awesome!!.Last certainly least flyovers military jets!!!. simply cannot put price tag seeing couple jets fly hospital, case, school.

That’s don’t trust government officials. What, bad parenting utter lack disregard others, prevents least wearing masks it?  No, want make world better place. looking subservient employees. get yes-man system charge ahead storm busted ass boat. Kinda like whole country moment especially Florida. Fox News boomer mention little kids, trying get wear masks day school go well. Thank fuck finished college last year deal stupid bullshit. Buy Term life insurance name beneficiary.

Well yes hence think he’s rancid fuck knuckle well I’m saying he’s blameless Tories shite whole thing (and prior imo) laugh people like “literally government’s fault” announcing pubs reopen saying “you must go get wankered spoons lick friend Jason’s face” Ah ok wondering Judge court law got mixed this. also doesn’t help driver wasted time money driving fare cancel aren’t wearing mask.

Lockdown #2 real. still wave 1 crashes across India, Africa, South America. matter what, though, good ole US keep coronavirus lit like Olympic flame collective demise. Bingo. 

Theres difference Karen breathing everyone walks crowded boulevard protestors shouting fuck police mask separated others 6-10 feet. wasn’t saying was, substantial undercounting. imagine severity curve shifting entirely towards less severe, even allowing people would died stay hospital longer, number reduced hospitalizations overall would still produce negative trend IMO.  higher incidence hospitalization death. Reducing hospitalizations deaths percentage results net decrease hospitalizations even reduced deaths counted hospitalizations.

Good points. also wonder lower rates cardiovascular disease also plays role mortality rates (compared Americans). It’s almost spread protests something. Real talk, hospital rates looking? I’ve noticed distinct pattern southern states, goes little something like 

* We’re closing down, we’re moving forward re-openings we’re mandating masks 

* Cases rising, hospital capacity deal surge 

* It’s damn kids responsible spread taking thing seriously 

* We’re going close bars indoor restaurants again, wear mask you’re public can’t 6 feet away someone

* reopened early, hospitals brink getting overwhelmed 

*Coming soon*

* We’re issuing another stay home order flatten curve. Please stay home often possible go unless it’s essential items

That's opinion course, seems consistent observed patterns data. way deaths reported Sweden means could time lag one month - yes whole month! - enters official statistics. combination obvious timelag reporting infections means that, look data given point time, almost always looks like number cases deaths peaked decreasing regardless case reality. another, sudden, large increase infection rates recently happened. yes, significant problems Swedish data.

Sorry pisses overlap people demand schools open back people work...but also people fought universal daycare, universal PreK, year-round school, after-school care programs.  Parents figure daycare birth 5 years old, every summer, every Christmas break, every Spring Break, etc. refrain ""you kids problem find care."" whole thing shown true colors broken America is. social contract barely exists. I'll hard pressed think country even survive next decade without mass violence. problem weekend lag, whole world got problem. Look e.g.  see pattern.  work hospital south Florida don’t see change work load... yeah we’re getting ton positive patients admission rate low. 3 Covid floors rate they’re admitted also discharged. misunderstood letter. spreads droplets airborne. Masks protect both, 100% protect airborne particles. still far better protected wearing mask not. There's factors, experts I've listening still say distancing #1. Naturally, indoors place like Walmart, really want focus three things - distance, mask, time. go wearing mask, keep distance, get ASAP reducing infection chances likely considerable amount. Naturally things together likely multiplicative usefulness.

This precisely wife do. quickly possible, going meds/necessities first place. mask up, fast, spend time near anyone. room without masks transmission likely, although certain.

If different rooms depends whether AC set recirculate air, quality air filters. maybe teachers strike, antsy parents get free babysitters anymore. Actually dead ppl take hospital beds, moment deceased Easy, invent time machine start contact tracing 3 months ago Slow elective, yes. Emergency, no. saw people another thread talking ab since people unemployed they'll flocking line subs schools year 😹 know, man. Since things closed, socialized anyone. NY broke 1000 cases per day since early June. # daily new cases fluctuates downward trend past weeks. see. think issue different types N95 masks, simple dust masks way medical grade. valve, makes sense would kind people wildfire areas familiar with.

Lockdown 100 daily new cases? don’t even wear mask 11000 cases Florida Schools perfect network spread virus rapidly. Places spread lucky timing since virus started towards end school year warmer months. schools open fall... weather gets colder... it’s also cold flu season... it’s gonna really bad 7000 people, understand hits town, 7000, \~70 ish people get sick and/or die. That's staggering number small town. might barely many people pass single year. love public works photo ops!

Finally fix things corrected months ago everyone throws party, seriously it’s best. Taiwan, south Korea, Hong Kong, Japan got handle too.

Scratch Japan lol No? stupid reductive. 93F 100% humidity uncommon either. heat wave weeks ago left majority Boston area inside.

You know talking about. NJ going back students wearing masks optional. fear teacher friends. Source 1000 cases day NY? don’t see anywhere new York flattened curve naturally things re-open kidding. Texas added 600 people hospitals one day last week. 20 beds what, hour's worth hospitalizations rate? think Texans opted ventilator

Glad trending down. think majority people getting message.  Yeah, could say thing every single one idiots almost like using prison labor bad idea! Could Scientologists? Osterholm walking statement back listen podcasts. surly wrong claiming confusion aerosol vs. droplet terms. aerosol scientist define aersol less 100um health people called droplets. assinine opnion reached aerosol researchers huge group University works. 

Don Milton UMD great research space, opnion got ignored long. paper showed surgical masks significant reduction transmission. 

He wrong shitty facemasks studies poorly analyze terrible assumptions Science hard, conspiracies easy directly align cognitive biases. Wise decision. need money continue literally rape whatever part population want to. I'm really disgusted non challant attitude typical area. 

A gas station manager tested positive sent home work. bar told everyone one seemed concerned. 

So guess reality I'm going constantly exposed area regardless US, yes lockdowns delaying inevitable. That’s didn’t build functional testing contact tracing systems locked down. test trace getting case numbers control, real shot truly managing pandemic. arg perfect virus super contagious kills one. friend group fits bill exactly.

They’ve least 4 gatherings 6+ people last month (and high risk state.) wearing masks. thought process think clean symptoms, one got tested 2 months ago clean then. top one still working mingle people work hours. Currently fighting keep trying save warn careless risking lives... somehow turned personal attack care apology? Idk it’s actually stupid.. anyways still hung yesterday. Despite data facts. give up. Thanks that. I’ve found, black sheep family (the rest inconvenienced change, even though siblings agree theory - want keep parties), I’d rather step back hopefully preserve relationships aggressive surely destroy them. figure either way, result same. suspect siblings adapt things get worse. maybe I’m wrong. adapt, parents socializing less (my siblings ones gatherings, inviting parents seem getting spite left!). Unfortunately, sometimes late late.

I go bit education coworkers simply undereducated, willfully defiant. Tats far effective. Though might agreeing face. handful us work trying get masks less political less divisive wear. drunk person thinking properly? Also strong correlation average IQ lights. is, states lower average IQ shining brightest. trust anything science says. They've changed narrative every week since started. guy made millions dollars thinks common sense best. listen anyone else? you? curious places already decided I'm person safe enough. Professors necessarily old. age range like profession. Deaths normalized country nobody cares. u/undeleteparent shit? judge told that? 

Now positive news. stay home order may pointless though. 

Businesses are/have opening despite orders. People refuse comply. 

There actually enforcement. Los Angeles County. grocery stores see almost everyone wearing one though. bUtThEdEaThRaTeIsGoInGdOwN guy dumb fuck, ignorant pathetic. think he's retarded. true. Look official CDC data here. 
TX FL 100% total deaths expected, big increase prior years. NY/NJ expected due COVID. settle arguments undercounting. gets updated daily new data comes in. Could die much quicker airborne state compared droplets. denialism tempered enough people see friends family get sick die. doctor friend shared first-hand observation: many recover suffer organ damage. refuse wear masks take precautions effectively drunk drivers. Crossing paths fatal. Ronnie, always look sad?  **Can suffocate wearing P100 mask plane flight?**  

I take flight Seattle NYC. (I'm terrified.) want wear P100 half-mask I've acquired flight. However, mask cautions use ""atmospheres containing less 19.5% oxygen."" seems like planes oxygen drop low 15%. unsafe wear P100 mask plane flight? would think PACU nurses could care patients contraception / sexual education important. Let idiots fuck want without bringing kids fold Dunning-Kruger effect full display. don’t know better experts, believe protests spreader events doesn’t mean support protests political methods. seems far likely simply spouting place ignorance support political opinions credibility compared actual experts. problem unemployment extension run out. bartenders know make 500 week. 500 week absolute maximum get state UI. one frustrating things...NV rushed open even sooner CA side, El Dorado County South Lake Tahoe one first counties allowed start reopening CA. problem sides lake counties super rural, weighs countywide positive rates testing. cases Tahoe, shut again...its nightmare. No.

USA donald bump blame though. chance lock everything probably early December, really even knew here.

We never grip this. infecting people,
Hospitalizing killing December, tests couldn’t identify inaccurately reporting pneumonia flu related. Since primarily kills elderly slow feel alarmed.

That’s finally started testing mass March found everywhere once.

And day still haven’t locked travel. Imagine December, Trump issued order lockdown travel country lockdown people / economy because;

 “Trust me, virus bad, like bad bad, maybe worst ever”

That would fun. Meanwhile almost every developed nation world contending degree actually fairing worse deaths per million bases (UK, Italy, Spain, Belgium, France) don’t wear mask reason don’t wear underwear. Things gotta breathe

Is smell is? Well, it. One data point available, don’t believe data metrics. virus here. increase anything. I’ll buy first round bar tonight, beat it! Burned asshole similar situation family physician (who also director multiple nursing homes) moron husband. moron husband retired scientist. dont know things happen.  Took 10 days test back March. time quarantined getting test results, actually quarantine day got results. article say that. Empires last long. American one coming end, seems. - US study - point stands. deaths major issue virus. lot ppl gonna fucked life. yah live since treatments getting better. hospital one day 12 hour training telemetry nurses work ICU case emergency opinion completely utterly wrong. Great job jumping assumptions though. undesired is, human nature want scapegoat whenever bad things happen.
The fact origin virus pretty much known make particularly difficult determine victims scapegoat-search. petitions Disney world workers pause reopening enough people signing them. got COVID confirmed started little dry throat, periods constantly, temp first 37-37.6°C (I'm Chile IDK many F° those)

Then week after, case specially virus went digestive side respiratory side (in contrast father, example) like 7-8~ days fever 38-39°C felt like shit, like reeeeeeeeal bad

Now, case, maybe small cold COVID, IDK USA works Chile tests free father got tested symptoms mother positive, much issues get test done.

I would free like Chile, maybe would wait little (but guess free right?) Nah, go ""sky falling"" think new president going even remotely enough fix cultural issue. True, Trump absurdly, cartoonishly divisive. end day, cause this, took advantage it. people problem. they'll still around Trump gone. Maybe they'll less emboldened. Maybe they'll quieter. still here, still fucking everything up. laying dormant next Trump comes along. next one lot smarter, lot malicious? lights country. love students, might literal death me, without even trying. whats really going complicate things existing medicines people take now, effects blocked whatever injected prevents virus attacking specific protein least charge.  love God vote one get bored Trudeau something.  Look stupid got US UK elections Brexit love God guys France Germany hold torch now. know many students would’ve perhaps taken gap year defer enrollment.

They announce decision cancel campus activities/classes late August, hope late kids make arrangements. coming NZ, I'm envious right now. LOL funny trying say came Spain. longer know yet. Don’t Come ~~From~~ Go Away Even one relatively new type vaccine (live, non-replicating adenovirus-based). reading whole comment first sentence ('caught') takes whole new meaning. Like powers discovered corruption absolutely must find mastermind give promotion I'm United States. I'll first line here. Also 71% pollution world [10 who's really blame? seriously, government took lowest amount effort -- listen public health officials scientists. legacy get history books, good them. Absolutely nothing wrong that.

And Canadian government went competition New Zealand terms country keep population alive infections minimum, I'd Olympics event. I'm disagreeing that.

The narrative ICUs filled Covid patients case going data. live Calgary (many times called idiot city, sorry Edmonton bringing done us via Kenny) masks find many WORKERS wearing (properly non nose BS) T&amp;T (a large Asian super market across western Canada maybe East?) one stores absolutely mandate temperature checks. I've lot shopping (also love Japanese snacks Asian skin care haha). However stores I've follow social distancing find people tend pretty good dodging isle (however tend shop late can't speak busy) wear mask I'm essential worker (social work) lupus. I've single person side eye question why? clerks Macs thanked wearing one. hand sanitizer almost every store go (the Timmies next sure drive thru McD coffee now) cases quite low nice. currently feel nervous going out, could change Dr Hinshaw life saver (our public health Dr Kenny (morron MP) let's run show don’t know that. friend prof Northwestern department made clear happy clean house hire cheaper (younger, desperate, untenured) professors. majority Canada's right wing politicians left moderate Republicans. many hard right wackos religious nutjobs much propaganda. problems though. # practice run 2003 SARS one affected areas. great deal resources manpower spent create unified infection control network federal, provincial local levels. Even small rural hospitals dedicated infection control department monitors enforces proper behaviour doctors nurses.

I can't speak counting ICU patients differs countries, patients placed ICU soon require breathing tube. 

Canadian hospitals get money classifying patient covid patient vs respiratory illness. say arrested, say Trump found newest Press Secretary morons pay attention history class. wonder even believe black pague real, Spanish flu.

To probably fake news. 10K cases day, lol. America actually thinks it’s good job. 2019 Military World Games

Really interesting whether they're specifically COVID-19 cases change fact facilities running beds? matter stroke, car crash, whatever. lack beds lack beds that's problem, whether like not, state spiking cases novel virus causes serious even fatal disease.  thought could help president demanded it. study study showed causing harm good delayed revoking emergency permission. That's political, science-based compassionate. Nonono remind me. Everyone protesting Black Lives Matter selfish pricks kill everyone's grandmother. Oh god. comments mouth breather galore. scary actually. swim far pull trunks look innocent. need sure air good long time (hours maybe direct sunlight) uber use, disinfecting every single interior surface put kids there, least imo. Damn, get one school I'd already measles mumps point. won’t many coming back - lot schools 50-100% remote frequent testing students quarantine processes place. Colleges easily controlled general populace. thought read places like Korea people wear due bad pollution Asia general people often wear masks they’re sick. normal wear always public? Ah see hospital closed SHTF I'm living im forest full time well aware might die something stupid. day day tbh. I'm good dying stupidity wear mask kill others. Woah! Houston proper? antibody nasal swab? Asking friend... Probably works well Google Flu said end July.

^(Parent commenter ) [^(delete message hide live city, everyone except crackheads wears masks inside stores/on train/at protests etc Exactly allow VA claim Weekend deaths always low. comes delays reports. 

Also, deaths always 2 weeks surge cases. !remindme 2 weeks last visit, psychiatrist said thought covid would longer topic conversation November. course in-person visit everyone else switched telemedicine whenever possible. try think I've happy otherwise. NZer here, away week holiday (domestically course). lot places still quiet, talking guides stuff everywhere, saying things starting pick faster thought school holidays starting today, lot things booked completely. family also went away trip domestically today usually go Australia together year using money NZ now.  mean makes sense here. word spike kinda lost meaning though, people use wrong time. trying design groups last night, luckily survey students end year want cohort following year (usually 6-8 each) special projects, field trips, etc. expanded form them, student input already.

Still though, matter hard try organize cohorts going friction. Especially middle school friendships tend super transitional, year can't be. 

They ""I would uncomfortable group person"" list, people make uncomfortable suffer long list short enough feasible. problem list 20 80 students grade least 1 probably group. Foxnews says counting covid-19 deaths. Welp settles morons. sure. instance, came classroom first thing morning chairs up, would race next person see could put first. imagine Americans would take chair sit it. sticky spot desk, I’d thrilled reason go washroom get wet paper towel. got attendance (mark absent walk sheet office) grade 5 reward. number 10,000, representative July 4th parties. number people got last weekend,

It's worse that. appears we're talking people got 10-14 days ago. That's usually 5 days incubation period, days get sick enough get tested, days get results another day two report results. 

This shit spread far wide. also mRNA.

Huh, interesting... aware that. worry, I'm Vancouver intention go anywhere near east coast. Eat ass need money need money Ok real talk, Obamacare end many. fact started avoiding doctors hospitals soon Obamacare became thing, deductible went roof actual monetary coverage visits went way down. wasn’t recently either, exactly Obamacare got signed law. 

I never even saw deductible health insurance law passed in. It’s universal health care, even close. Anyone near middle class seen health costs skyrocket since enacted in. It’s still something better nothing, hence Dr Orange’s attempts recently fully appeal abhorrent especially time like this, it’s like Obamacare ultimate solution begin with. fact since became enacted, hospitals healthcare providers operating like business less like actual healthcare. shied lot people away medical attention due sudden outrageous costs Every single person work Trumpie anti-mask. boils blood going work people every day i'm early 30's, they're 50's. work closer 6 feet can't say anything else everything crash me. guess shove MILLIONS CORPSES ditch, yeah? 

That's heart disease Sleep prone night can, help lungs out. Yes, actually. Look graph NY cases peaked. That’s exactly happened. meant emergency overflow.

[NY governors different states playing rock Paper Scissors really want US government type control CCP has?  Yes. I'm making fun people think otherwise saying isn’t testing done. I’m showing reliable source significant testing done. 
= Faulty. 


And statement Swedish strategy wrong. Nobody trying get young people infected. would instance universities closed since March...? Spanish Flu 1918 originated US, Chinese Flu Spain? Sleep prone night can, help lungs out, hope feel better soon. mean: ""Just wait two weeks!""? replies depressing. people refuse vaccine, things going get back kind normal states? Covid death another reason Covid, Toronto still counted Covid death

If anything ""controversy"" weeks ago counting many deaths I'm likely boat. Pressure tested even though pneumonia February.

Extreme fatigue, non-restorative sleep, high heart rate still. months feverish feeling daily almost daily finally got better June.

I'm doctor see reason skeptical possibility long term permanent effects. already know lost viral syndrome exists viruses. ? Functionally zero would expect. use individually wrapped sterile swabs test. considered they're pointing make clear making argument rather pointing possibility curious about?
I mean saying argument reasons op already said himself, also argument comment? ( Sound familiar? ) Time military style field hospitals. Anyone know navy ship hospital got sent? learning live virus folks, letting huge parts west coast burn there's one left fight wildfires. ER visit, know actual doctor's visits. always made pay much bill upfront, gone times refused service one time needed ambulance. I""ve told usually refuse treat beyond certain point. took x-rays arm broken, need payment upfront anything else. U guys saying months. still waiting lol Oh yea that's true. many countries succesfully opened still well. nice. extraordinary measures places slow down. COVID hands tied behind back, legs shackled together, blindfold on, still much damage 2-10 ordinary flu seasons *in 4 months*. love people assume washing hands enough... wearing mask lol would retail better sewing?

I never really knew teenager spent time internet. might mentioned getting internship software developing company wanted become software developers adults. would gotten ice cream selling internship unless wanted become professional ice cream sellers adults. husband uber driver. Hes going back work extra 600$ unemployment ends. I'm terrified bringing home getting attacked requiring masks. I’m Karen pointing taxes paid people?

Lol, okay moron. Also beach tends windy anyway doubt big risk. 

So aerosol spit one person gets carried dozen people sitting nearby. really check reading comprehension.  claimed faked data. claimed legitimate concerns raised Swedish data reported. parents excited flights Boston Miami Labor Day $75 round trip. I’m like smokers 60? death wish? That’s medical debt sold collections. sold pool bad debt, can’t buy one persons debt. ohh, shame u clap every time dies too? sub looooovvvveees deaths lol. China claims 4600 deaths? Common sense tells that's true. strictly educating children, would stick eLearning time being.


The messaging leaders admitting loud said years - “We needs kids back school economic purposes”


So basically it’s reconfirmed glorified babysitting service. least could pay us like one. Thanks, exactly. PSU made statement they’d _tentatively_ in-person classes nearly month ago, back cases low. PSU student, tell fall classes switched remote learning within past week. COVID? lockdown?

Because unmitigated COVID going even bigger impact economy... understand might say that, there's reason [literacy declared unconstitutional 1970: used primarily disenfranchise minority voters. completely reasonable expect sort literacy intelligence test used determine voter eligibility, would used exactly purpose.

It's easy enough create test always passed people like rarely passed people don't. are. think that's pretty clear point. faked see close (family/advisors etc) world would react. father pulled similar stunt. Oh sorry wasn’t meant personal attack all. 

I’ll rephrase, Coming Canada, can’t understand “you” (the US) gotten point you’re country regarding masks Look agree well- he’s absolute fucking pleb. he’s forcing people go Cos pubs open again. Leeds city Center yesterday busy people last minute Christmas shopping. feel like people like “I’m bored it’s bad more” don’t seem realise easily go backwards. 

Absolute lack common sense Boron Johndick’s fault. can’t stick tories people completely disregarding safeties thick IMO. wonder many dead take USA whole take threat seriously. all.

More 130,000 apparently It’s vitamin D. shortage science US. political social unwillingness apply it. got tested Quest state really decreased cases last weeks still took 9 days get results back (negative) US debtor jails FFS, people don’t pay bills damn time don’t go jail. relate statement way Get ready another shelter-in-place order, get ready another round stimulus. Americans can't change fucking behavior. Tbh, lot people we're speaking purely number-wise. listened course moved it. I’m currently college student. Last semester things started close (dining halls, social lounges, etc.) friends started looking loopholes hang large groups. asked everyone’s sake (including roommate share tiny room with) called manipulative controlling telling acting dangerously irresponsibly, got kicked group. people campus ICU reporting symptoms. It’s worked here. less hospitalized locked down. media doesn’t want u know lol. Bingo. state, they're claiming pay full costs testing everyone knows absolutely happen.

One disheartening things I've heard idea 3 4 Fifth Grade teachers get sick school class go remote managed remaining teacher. Great, worked three colleagues job. School systems readily take advantage teachers, I'm excited upcoming year. Yet people laugh wearing mask gloves store. Eh, Taiwan, south Korea, Hong Kong, Japan got handle too. oversimplification. complicated that. example, students awarded scholarship given ""choice"" decline seat lose award vs putting risk attending. International students ""choose"" attending fall declining seat returning home country. College becoming necessary earn living wage students lucky enough come upper middle class + background secure support system truly ability ""vote dollar."" I'm admin another University seeing half assed plan leadership finally started roll fall, made call move programs online year. worth risk. Yep. Lack leadership, simple preventive measures got politicized president hell bent winning election Nov wants ignore safety protocols pandemic. can't mandate masks?? don’t want virus don’t get infected it’s complicated Hollywood beach. can't speak backyard parties inland, closing beach actually kind worked here, Broadwalk deserted I've ever seen even though bars/restaurants open. Consider number parties happening weekend. Lots places gave July 3rd employees well. Lets look future timeline. take anywhere days week typically, sometimes 2 course, symptoms show up. July 11, see majority people contracted COVID July 4th showing symptoms. Another week later July 18, start see cases July 4 parties peaking, day alone. Another week, July 25, long people able admitted hospital, start seeing people succumb COVID persist another 3-5 weeks.

The number 10,000, representative July 4th parties. number people got last weekend, buying shit July 4 parties. Think that. growth going monstrously explode. assure you, I’ve never loved it. Could get groceries stuff delivered instead  Remember didn’t half-ass stuff afraid soviets going “win”? &amp;#x200B;

Yep loser bin you. 

Bye Bye can't apply tape yourself, apply tape. paid 20 grand pocket three kids, insurance. We're still recovering financially that. success takes mistakes things go wrong like Argentina. I'm still following precautions, people getting careless. Local prices PPE hand sanitizer go since peak March, good time stock case number cases increases again, winter even Covid shows little seasonality. Sure buddy....lol would situation could safe unsafe PD? 

Example, call family member threatens kill us scene fast enough even though were. UNARMED PERSON going seconds count??? Run hide??

There de-escalation techniques police know becoming widely available. funding places there. cops area great job ignorant told it. 

Ideally, perfect country, social workers would great. Violence country would major hinderance. 

Shoot first think later makes look ignorant. interactions country many people die day? Believe me, there's people trust trying shoes somehow become cops. Placing people category some
do bad, bad ignorant. deal BS toward race, sex, sexual preference, even profession. ignorance stop. probably one made old sock. goes Europe. really doubt another lock possible. bunch Karens! unemployment system broken government failed give anyone security net, people forced work. It’s abhorrent. federal government failed every single one us. words local infectious disease expert: “Wearing masks constitutional issue, it’s public health issue.” 
I mean actual fuck wrong people? defies logic reason. makes sad, makes lose hope humanity cannot come together nation pandemic mitigate risk vulnerable population. Wearing mask public prevents spread virus, protects economy businesses open safely operate. Screaming cussing teenagers puts really low evolutionary spectrum. idiots left come here. stayed.

People worried social mental health students. middle school teacher, open back up, socializing, going back guidelines keep kids safe may make mental health WORSE. Kids going scared, going feel safe, hate say it, lot learning done. Students need feel safe comfortable learn best.

The difference politicians job elected infuriating. Yes, _but_ spread/no spread thing. Take measles chickenpox – truly airborne. Walk room someone disease been, get infected.

We know, Covid infectious. _are_ cases, transmitted air condition. airborne transmission main infection mechanism, would far worse is. main infection mechanism droplet infection. well prevented usual masks. So, class one covid infected kid wears mask, 6 feet distance, chances nobody gets infected good. decide sing song (singing one strongest aerosole producing procedures), highly likely several catch Covid despite wearing cloth surgical masks.  There's people can't breathe masks. legit can't excuse. need cloth homemade ones. containing micro droplets DeSantis

One might even say he’s *monkeying up*.... 3000 people die 9/11 abandon freedoms privacy start multiple wars also kill thousands innocents put children debt. yea - 3,000,000 whatever - won’t wear mask.

2) UC campuses going shut winter realize they’ve made terrible, stupid mistake (because won’t enough people justify campus operations ones show dangerous irresponsible wrt spreading infection) 
3) substantial tuition hikes. explain would one virus other. Surely completely different time.

There’s blame instances. lines thinking irresponsible. point think will, it’s unbelievable governors assuming hospital staff work matter I've looked. need support sadly live small beach town east coast beach wasn’t crowded all. fact surprised see empty spaces tiny parking lot. rain 3 hours afternoon. NK likely shortage PPE, though. right next China easily ask tens millions PPE China. (which would probably fulfilled considering close relationship). bullets. would remove ability involved plead fifth. Inject high doses Sars-Cov2 claim died Covid-19 complications.  Americans dumbest people planet. time 3 months ago. think it’s safe family 5 come socially distance, are, enjoying beach? typically come Clearwater first week August every year, everything going pandemic Florida, we’re strongly considering forgoing vacation year. amazing people survived invention club. Hes wrong either. That's residential positivity rate. 7 day average positivity rate TOTAL tests closer 18% want (NOT REOPENING) university well tbh Typically system like seperate conditioning ventilation separate neutral air ventilation system. case heat pumps serving smaller areas wont sharing air large groups people. should. message never going happen administration focused getting reelected focusing pandemic. divided America president divides it. can't even asks Americans wear mask simple thing show unity solidarity fighting virus. United stand. Divided fall!.... muRiCa! website satire, fyi. Des Moines weekend. I'd say 80% mask usage. Almost employees everywhere wear them. 

I like damn y'all civilized huh? maybe 10% usage. peaked 33% month ago. Nice deflection Deaths Sweden must reported within one month. two weeks. Source:FHM. movie theaters Utah since last 2-3 years hospital ads movie starts. Trying get come hospital something happens you. think might fact people vitamin deficiency spend time outdoors less likely confined contact people indoors rather vitamin key. question comes shops enforce it. fair put grocery store clerks firing line anti-mask people wre often hostile. masks indoor retail told outright outside asking someone wear mask, continue refuse nothing. stores dont security team. Teach coping skills. days every case infectious disease China generating clicks guess... Labs staffed people, people like work weekends. 40 hour work week standard country. Many labs closed weekends.

The fact we're 5 months figured confirmed case numbers lower weekends yet frankly blows mind. hope gonna close every club bars till vaccine developed would state refused pretty much safety measures pandemic that’s still warming expect anything else? know, pointing less people work reporting holidays sundays probably worse seems needs taken account people massive parties day. hospital ships? First, drive blood tests. swab nasal cavity recently saliva. 

I’m assuming got tests backwards. swab test negative one day positive next. depends viral load picked time. direct indicator infection. 

The blood test probably second test took test antigens unfortunately tell currently CV-19. point. It’s measuring response infection usually builds infection. indicate currently infected. infected point long enough ago body able produce antibodies. 

Also could cold. can’t distinguish COVID common cold. 

 foster husband's work requires frequently phone/ZOOM important customers. ""DAD CALL"" mode. means kids get watch movie/cartoons, get tablets play headphones on, playtime outside yard, take park, pile bedroom storytime board games, etc. invested kid tablet suggest two pack $150. Add kid-friendly headphones. run Sonic get slushies drive around circles radio finish them. Set-up village fill blankets. made kid-friendly game based movie Quiet Place. 

Basically bribe, threaten, cajole, whatever takes keep fucking quiet 4 hours time. 

Sometimes sets aside hour two time kiddo bedtime early morning wake completely uninterrupted work gives hour middle afternoon break kids sanity. might even try shift bedtime/wakeup time stay later sleep later, would mean morning work hours kiddo-free. 

I noticed matter kids got fussy around time every single day. Maybe blood sugar get tired. know. called ""y'all-hate-eachother-o'clock"" became running joke. 2:30 every single day kids go individual rooms books art supplies toys stay play quietly **or else**.  4 5. age guidelines foster training suggest kids able 10 minutes per year age, 40 minutes solo quiet time per day 4 year old age-appropriate. Mine range 5 10 hour. toddlers. time step family enough keep job danger emergency situation.  Sorry happening already. Kids better chance struck lightening dying this.. literally....

Absolute hysteria.... really both. July 3rd lowest raw case come since March. 100 cases according state website. mention us come lesser families relying us graduating fast possible. Tech, already take credits schools (132 compared 120 engineering majors), us can't afford waiting semester could half year wages delayed. It’s that, expecting teenager young adult parent siblings didn’t say bringing world shit parenting. family got dog kid didn’t want said dog, kid expected pay for/spend time training/clean dog? Yea. shit Sherlock's. causing anxiety depression adults. affect kids too? Lol, death toll low raise suspicion? Seems like they're bad job that. mean, fudging numbers state think would say fuck fudge numbers, deaths? 
 
Is crinkling tinfoil all? saying lefty arguments juvenile shortsighted? dare you. Shit. lost sarcasm, irony way too... Wait till see 112s love kids home, learning well home. kindergartener way behind siblings were, smart, professional teacher curriculum makes big difference. kids take 18 months school, they're going lot second graders showing school unable read.

I also hearing social worker friends calls abused kids dried up. one second think kids stopped abused. longer teachers confide see bruises faces.

It's one ethical dilemnas like trolley problem. matter choose, people die harms way. course ignore testing, tracing, isolation, etc. keep opening up? economics universities stretched irresponsible levels leverage cash flow administrations guessed money would never decrease. Ah “wait two weeks” post. Love those. Waaaaa, waaaaa. Buncha crying little babies. ""Woe me, I've got wear mask prevent millions Americans dying keep economy going"". What's next? want wear pants access antibiotics marches? press release came several hours actual study press already written press release. Karolinska got criticts that.

""Even remarkable Karolinska Institute published news report website even draft study published so-called preprint server. data review even read journalists others interested, news text. enough evidence responsible national organization specialists establish optimum standards... contagious loss taste smell symptom would reasonable takeaway somewhat-vulnerable, nervous type, regard groceries, mail, packages coming home? suppose happens two weeks you’re saying everything normal except lot bed availability. intend bed availability? seems it’s heading. bad then? New York here, hit hard again, I’m sure it. We’re getting bunch people flocking states trying run Covid probably bringing them. cane firework shows since lot places canceled theirs. top idiot New Yorker’s going vacations states. Cuomo May catch people make quarantine, know New Yorker’s left state came back. One would hope they’d quarantine upon return, I’d say wont. hear feel okay I’m quarantining time. Deaths lag new cases. I'm cheering hoping worst, fact takes time cases progress point. Right FL death rate likely made cases diagnosed early mid June...and that's things seemed manageable. went small outdoor bar KY opened, masked up, say hi owner. know.

As leave woman says, ""I feel good think need get tested covid tomorrow instead next week."" hit 110 + 90%+ humidity **in shop**

You dont open flames, water, steam everything else confined area outside. Steam baths typically set [110-115 100% must impossible hit that... Ding ding ding well, large number big corporations banks Toronto's financial district agreed early majority employees work home least September. regular day, upwards 200,000 people (myself included) would commute downtown core. ghost town many towers empty. think bug help quelling community spread. ""excess death"" number estimate itself, refer Covid deaths. doesnt really change anything.

There fewer people dying today Covid point past 3 months.

The fact *bothers* .. odd. Dear rest world, bit tied right now, making great again. Talk later. Sincerely, USA live small tourist town Oregon coast. tourist season population literally doubles flooded tourists California even Texas. 62 ICU beds large retirement community outbreak basically fucked. thank god everyday governor issued mask order thats thing keeping hospitals becoming shit show point. keep screaming idiots saying go back ""kids really affected much.""

So, fuck us teachers huh? hope learned lesson. husband awaiting results Monday morning test (from Health Department Florida) exactly going stop students socializing?

Hoping praying seems Welcome US health marketplace. covid figures then? they've gone pneumonia C.o.D instead? Beggers can't choosers xD fomite transmission smokescreen always totem westerners clinging wear masks public shut businesses involve prolonged close contact dense group people. Far easier pimp feel good measures like handwashing campaign spraying hand sanitizer everywhere get people wear masks avoid others. would go enforcing did? like people refusing wear going follow law. think Karen's throwing tantrums bad, wait folk AR15s start feel ""freedoms"" infringed. poor people ICU 3 months medically induced comas. Horrible horrible thought potentially dying knew told going make sleep machine breathe :( mean, asked long want people lock for. Right? whole “more tests=more cases” ignorant shit ever. wait, what? No! Ew wtf dude live US, state death last month. Still time change though Except Tampa Bay literally refers 3 different counties no. city Tampa, Florida ≠ Tampa Bay Housing dollars make TONS money. Right time elections  person?? obsessed football season dorms?? Time prohibition. old news. many 30 icu died. Elon Musk gave title engineering multiple businesses owns. Ahh yes pending 1,000% increase deaths despite hospitals even run yet. political entity serving political interests first foremost. sad indeed. smokers. think everyone taste still. Legit might cold. Someone get tested yesterday check, it’ll days get results. haven’t started yet, although chest pain, think it’s Costochondritis started like 2 weeks ago. shortness breath breathing nice smooth me. Thinking it’s crazy coincidence, monitor see changes. saw chance took it, many sure knowledge would likely shut immediately due appalling behavior States insurance regulatory bodies believe. technically everything value judgement left individuals? without benefit universal basic income, additional unemployment compensation, universal healthcare, etc still workers facilities risk beyond would normally choose economic consequences They'll keep whatever number raise blatant suspicions make leadership look like utter failures luddites. Heros coronavirus... oh believe personal responsibility. got University administrations exercising TON wishful thinking right now. Endowment laws proving extremely stupid well. What's point money donated school can't used once-in-a-generation crisis? kinda felt Charlie Baker governor MA. Really wasn’t wild year, damn haven’t loved COVID response I'm waiting Russian Chinese (or GOP) propaganda bots start spreading rumours Tommy Douglas Nazi gave poison blankets indigenous leaders something.

Everybody talks now. war. war mind, safety future generations. battle stay true, commit cooperating human beings. wanted life exciting sci-fi plot world threat (with ragged band rebels) thing stopping it? got it! forget shove full spectrum LED light butt, work Don’t wear mask go public, expect get Corona. wait colleges, work high school district still moving forward start back students first week August. We're fucking San Antonio, know, one biggest hotspot cities officially run available hospital beds entire city. 7th largest city country.

We're fucked. anyone think going dentist? avoiding even though issue. called dentist day lady phone blew precautions annoyed asked Maybe dumb question pay test US? Minecraft weighted blanket helps me. Generally gators wont bother kayaker.

I one launch berm next canal in. Scared shit even though knew pnly reason happened suprised natural reaction head fast water gets suprised. happened kayak right picked rush water. never paddled home faster life. Easy solution: Stop admitting 60+ years-old covid patients. need daily updates every individual us state city?

The world bigger US see constant reposts countries various counties cities. wait, couple weeks new cases going switch increasing deaths. I'm looking forward it, fact comes along boneheaded decisions FL making. Except appeal process local government revoked permit. Since states pushing masks also anti-gun there’s incentive establish appeals process. 

It’s almost like someone came plan way chip away people’s ability firearm, absolutely nothing people’s health all. don’t think Easy Cheese (or aerosolized cheese) widely available Canada. know it’s revolting (triumph technology conscience), would trade case Dressed chips American one tin stuff. need big fine, $50 enough make person think twice. Maybe double second offenders, triple third, etc. Fines easy enough hand out. "" want couple nut jobs. worth 50￠to explain corruption Chinese influence WHO. Lol. I'm straight dude guy. Definitely pro-life one... Uh yeah basically expect MUCH WORSE repeated

Do know long wait test parts TX? 8 hours. It’s lot worse we’re seeing Hearing country happy friends Cal State deal it. Like mobile phone data used months ago push theory. Sometimes weak circumstantial evidence trying fuse association used promote deflect real criminal acts. familiar that, then. peaked stayed level. work riddle sphinx.

Tell government. smart way things. proactive instead reactive virus, well done keep good work. think they're testing antibodies yet. They're testing active Covid infection, test can't tell past. Enormous parties heavy drinking mask usage :( Lol no, good highly recruited think that’s fear Obviously posting sub play well majority people here, seem subscribe common sense. Maybe could start ""r/kill em let jesus sort out"" fellow posters agreeable world view. Public transportation Sorta like stillborn baby America idea managed infections? Yeah agree. We've really good staying home going restaurants parks stuff. helps massively financial support stay home, restaurants remain open fraction capacity. ""but careful!"" account one month old...... WTF talking about? Wow!! That’s insane! :o given time 5 dogs WalMart. don’t even bother fake vests anymore. 

No one stands anyone anymore. Nice try. actively tried stop spread country letting everyone fly out. countries tried close borders, cried racism. Coordinated national response. mask haters, conspiracy theorists racists Canada - overall, (in general) trust leadership see common burden bear. brought best us worst some. Way fuck up, every state outside Northeast. Well fuck filed mine June 30th. believe Florida 10,059 confirmed cases July 4th then? fudging numbers would intentionally make look bad? It’s also saying high saturated fat diets may contribute long term issues chronic inflammation attention /r/keto Fomite: inanimate surfaces objects Way go Michiganders right. trump bad. russian bounties, new cases. thats 56.25... ?

is state?

because county.

what 56.25% zero.. 

call hospitals get back us.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The count reveals 8 pediatric ICU beds among major hospitals South Palm Beach County, 3 hospitals showing ICU bed availability designated pediatric cases.

#### Pediatric ICU Bed Count Availability 4 p.m. Sunday, July 5, 2020:

Bethesda Hospital East: 3 pediatric ICU beds.

Bethesda Hospital West: 0 pediatric ICU beds.

Boca Raton Regional Hospital: 0 pediatric ICU beds.

Delray Beach Medical Center: 0 pediatric ICU beds.

West Boca Medical Center: 5 pediatric ICU beds.  definitely parallels drawn handling pandemic climate change, think comparing anti-maskers people drive cars correct.

Climate change needs solved systemic level. move away fossil fuels toward electric vehicles would path solution. cannot blame people using car, since often something need order make living, definitely blame anti-maskers using mask. 

Choosing use mask denial science, choosing use car sometimes option. yet 5% excess deaths. 

&amp;#x200B;

So no, ""it likely would counted FHM numbers."" true, opposite. FHM count Covid-19 death accurately. think everything remains end. would assume they'd use ER halls inpatient rooms, done prior years. 

What happens Tampa Bay covid+ people general, idk. idea happens there's room hospitals. would hope gvt comes w something people using “science” intelligent sounding crutch science is: Presented variously depending publication
Usually run finite conditions, 12 subjects
Often contradictory (both sides may peer reviewed published)

Maybe go college stop shitting bed. Fuck embarrassed wrote idiotic barely coherent words. That’s great question, would hazard guess never deal “icu surge”capacity before. Many hospitals mass casualty protocols pandemic response would need somewhat different resources. top that, many mass casualty protocols involve essentially shuffling less critical patients around system. thing pandemics. hospital center survey went around April asking “what skills have? Ever worked vent? Would willing learn?” done order form surge teams people *might* confidence skill set try deal surge. Many healthcare friends across country redeployed fields. transplant coordinator sent ICU RN. GI PA went ER. best could. 20 years healthcare experience never seen kind thing happen healthcare system before. Because.... fReEdOmS

If anything act bioterrorism gets much stiffer penalty drunk driving. That’s extremely BS LISTEN MEDICAL EXPERTS!!!!!!!

^unless ^they ^say ^something ^we ^dont ^like It’s pervasive. issue perception sound medical knowledge. Instead able generalize realize healthy immune system protects us viruses, science wants know exactly pathway (assumes single pathway), want know works exact virus.

So people realize new virus emerging wait months year even give advice people eat healthier improve overall health immune system.

To reductionist mindset, need randomized double blind placebo controlled trials know nutrition help covid. 

While think theory would helpful there’s two major issues

1. can’t double blind diet

2. rarely receive funding needs. Pharmaceutical companies aren’t paying study diet Covid. study funded government know, take lot time actually get government funding, funding pulled almost time. 

So respect way science done, I’m also realistic science give us answers need need them, current reductionist paradigm doesn’t like idea something simple healthy diet help us viruses, chronic disease list maladies. boat. get together though, even though stupider members society try make sure happen. optimistic win out. mid level hotels small A/c unit room states good people responding it. pretty alive NYC, they've building lot light rail L.A., I'm guessing going hard time recovering, especially since we're fucking dealing Covid, going away time soon. driving son hospital quarantine? state agency controls large amount school districts funding threatened (and recently reaffirmed threat) take away funding campus, person classes. hell bent it. happened people charged terrorism coughing others claiming it? NYT finally comes clean comes truth ""decoupling:"" America literally incapable weaning chinese imports despite yelling government media.

Take example N95 mask production: Wuhan first got locked doctors running PPE national government leapt action recalled mask workers taking 2 weeks lunar new year. Additionally, government nationalized private mask factories upgraded production equipment modern efficient systems possible. Combined paying people double overtime 7 days week churn masks, entire country able quadruple mask production pre-pandemic levels month.

Now first phase crisis ended, government returned control N95 factories private corporations again. everyone involved, win-win: state got huge number masks domestic international use, factories got free upgrades tech tree paid government. people dealt way people would lived China Russia. Way less job stability right now. Although deemed essential, PTs OTs work everywhere 43% TMC ICUs. used say 10% cause concern, changed 15%, changed page remove comment entirely blew past it. Palm Beach here. don’t know, stayed home.   wonder exactly considered medical care. I’ve cancelled dental cleaning, would count example? doubt it’s big issue thoigh I'm sure feds ""accidentally"" send body bags help. Suffolk County (New York) less 50 new cases -- idiocy like going send us right back lockdown. pictures weekend ridiculous... can't quite understand lack foresight. know Hindsight 2020, 2020 seems fuck fore hindsight.

We need save economy, ok that?

A) Make sure safe get economy going safely

B) Get lockdown ASAP economy restart 3 weeks fucked even harder. 

""We idea"" said governors majors. Gross Government support business exist every country, failure compete wrong strategy focus governments. US Europe supporting economy giving super low low interest rate loans tax deduction certain business well, however focus manufacturing medical supplies, also workforce west strike non stop working condition isn’t top tier enough, two major factors make west can’t compete manufacturing medical supplies. likely never solved. Someone Twitter joked need offer free taco whatever state keeps 2nd wave lowest per 100,000 people. mean States well can't keep infections down. slow spread. NJ best along CT, happy NJ rn. plenty assholes idiots here, plenty people still following abiding precautions. I'd prefer indoor dining open rest summer that's going happen. However, reopening slow nice would've thought data reporting could exciting. Lol go small school right they’re planning reopening, much want see friends again... it’s going work. can’t keep college students visiting dorms throwing parties. They’re going find way. it’s much students I’m worried about, I’m worried staff mostly. professors kitchen staff really old don’t see working well. percent virus transmitted within droplet larger 300nm?  cares? free will. Don’t go work you’re scared. Everyone opened way early plain see everyone politicians forced openings Costochondritis sucks. kids get it. asthmatic lungs though, always thought related. ever asthma kid? actually got MMR last year outbreaks Disneyland, titer test showed 90% immunity single vaccination 1975, got Covid 30 days ago, thought sure got I'd end hospital, far I've managed stay (still worried stroke heart attack), wonder combined regular vitamin regimen helped stay hospital. got sick couple weeks. infectious + death rate = dangerous Yeah don’t get isn’t treated like drunk driving minimum. course! lot people working right also depend child care services (like ones article) continue supporting family. Lmfao. college student. knew get go colleges planned reopen would guise cash grab. obvious get go going able reopen disastrous response fed government. giving college aged kids much credit Also thank proving point indeed don’t well data review . could googled 115 days July lol. Yeah saw Toronto's 13 people protest. 
We reddit too.  Canada doesn’t idiots wearing masks, spreading intentionally, parties, etc. Can’t blame leadership stupidity people. Dude, unless they're showing ER completely full shit.

Adults Texas get ZERO state healthcare unless they're Social Security 65. can’t believe people want to! Coronazona Exactly. treated like game table tennis serious pandemic. dump literally infects deadly virus. Note we're entire discussion Sweden *better* reporting countries.

Most countries deaths reporting date. means website pulls data kind aggregator like ECDC going use lowest common denominator get graphs comparable across countries.

**Every country reporting lag. Every country weekly variations reporting.** point history internet screaming hyper-accurate deaths causes-of-death day every single country.

But get deaths report date, know deaths death date curve looks like, know reporting lag was. reason we're discussion Sweden makes data available *can* discussion.

And conspiratard knuckleheads twist claim Sweden's numbers somehow worse countries. insane! 1. People die hospital overrun.
2. hospitals florida hitting capacity. 4 Tampa Bay ran ICU beds today, several others close. 

This path new york followed, reason think it'll totally special different time valid reason. Ontario Canada specifically, limit wedding 10, lol buffets still closed indoor dining. Completely different virus. article says isn’t dangerous easily transmitted.. ahead studies cadavers medical histories determine many comorbid patients 3 4 fatal ailments died Covid instead simply “Covid symptoms” per CDC’s loose guidelines (which include fatigue fever).

Maybe instead assuming things educate yourself. Primary secondary cause deaths concepts would helpful says: Hydroxychloroquine work (when provided right doses

No doesn't. notice science tweaked today produce whatever results wish deliver.

Sounds like understand science works either. wonder spewing garbage. Every thread different country someone make america ""I know got it! inside whole time, go get mail... mystery.""


Sure. lot things different. hospital surviving staying two three days.

They're converting floors already nurses doctors. (the county hospitals), others yet (private hospitals taking transfers county hospitals, though). LOVE this... alot!! feel author's painful brain, going check blog entries, TY. evidence seasonal yet? curious someone NYC would suggest worst yet come. Downtown. Victoria Park/Richmond Row. can't keep adding beds. guess sarcasm tough read Reddit robots without “/s” Ah, ad hominem attack, go pull short straw. points calling moron definitely won’t convince me. Hoo, boy. I’m part mom group Facebook, lady two teenage daughters apparently much older son pregnant wife. lady husband live Florida, apparently transferring Texas. two greatest hotspots. flying back forth, keeps posting nauseous pregnant daughter law making feel better hanging time, taking eat, getting pedicures throwing huge parties feel normal. couple people attempted like, uh, live traveling plane another hotspot constantly, constant contact pregnant girl? goes well think would. Idiocracy right. Hope feel better soon  types people deserve publicly shamed, amongst lot things can't vocal without post removed 4th july shitshow non-social distancing UP. hope nothing comes it. Charge mfer attempted murder. Someone know went test today, results available 14-15 days ?! wish Dr. Birx Dr. Fauci could take whole response. corrupt. trust anything say point. CDC going provide real details data. whether US citizens follow guidance another story. last week. went beach I’m currently dead dying. see people dropping dead streets. parents live fine grandma family live don’t even know single sick person. 

Like it’s 10k cases days like week straight. tests done? Cause apparently Disney size crowd people getting tested every day don’t see that’s even remotely possible. Considering testing sites empty run. advocated. National leadership need legislation. establish committees handle national level working 50 states try get board common solution. Despite claims ""We're supply line"", something federal government could mobilized helped states get supplies tools needed. federal government good system set bought supplies ""because theirs"" quote Kushner also forced states compete supplies. Instead cooperation fostered federal government, state vs state battles encouraged system, actions federal government.

Secondly, also poo poo solutions problem national standpoint which, politically, puts governors like DeSantis marketed always backing president, position act ignorantly state level. fish always rots head. bad leadership top, leaks down. Even comes things people think weight, words, matters. 

This leader about. general battlefield leading men. happened here.  get downvoted I, absolutely right. creditors consider medical debt theur decisions lend not.


Even see healthcare US load bullshit. Nobody choose EATING OBTAINING LIFESAVING HEALTHCARE. NOBODY. Also maybe schools can't teach jack online. toilet. could US stay lockdown 2 years “easy”? Coronavirus approves message Yeah said earlier, even 4th July weekend. Lots stuff closed Friday on. says Swedish government **""done best""**

Being diplomatic mean demonstrably dishonest. Yes. article posted dated four weeks earlier one posted. Hospitals want foot bill. Yeah America going nuts masks. stories like ""Man tests positive attending 100-person wedding Cheesecake Factory's buffet... _AND ONE WEARING MASKS_!"" I'm like ok masks really headline issue here? mutation strain Italy New York since March. mutation least months ago, article made sound like mutated.  Hey now, learnin' good book anything Coronavirus. Must liberal plot destroy freedom liberty. logical conclusion.  I've encountered people reasoning wearing mask. help care. maddening. heard Americans admire advertising. Wherever find free space, put billboards. Think total surface area 320m masks many ads fit them! I'm pro mask vaccine I'll let others get first test safety profile. I'd love see Trump every member congress lead example line get vaccinated live TV show feel safe. healthy 25 year old probably wear mask club.

My point is, fact people going clubs almost certainly death sentence someone somewhere. melodramatic. I'm Utah mask wearing best 50 50 here. We've lucky deaths people paying attention back Tae Kwon classes, approval doctor, 5.5 weeks cancerous tumor top right kidney removed. albuterol 6.5 weeks alone never mind issues I’ve since March. easier time bouncing back cancer surgery illness. still can’t three TKD patterns without getting wheezy. Aerobic activity I’ve focusing moving around pool exercises like squats push-ups. strawman? 🤔 Nice post. also read another thread, sit forward seat.. air circulates rear.. 
Or, remove mask all.  P100 possible. fuck sake politics make goddamn thing much worse every step way? Come America, we’re better absolute horse shit Treating cancer doesn’t exclusively involve completely isolating human contact 4 months. Yeah, treat sick humans! Let suffer, right? good human are. someone enroll summer make semester say cancel Fall use summer catch up. Maybe spring vaccine. I'm doctor, much less epidemiologist, guesses:

1. Infections predominantly younger demographic, recovery rates better. mean deaths coming, secondary infections older family members seems inevitable.

2. infections far diffuse, hospital systems better able treat sick. also appears nearing limits sustain, again, we'll see.

3. cure vaccine, treat seems improved somewhat, identified certain techniques work better others. here! I'm going accept vaccine rushed suffer health complications later road. I'll wait take chances really highlight point taking calc 101 MIT versus random Community College isn’t different. math discovered long time ago don’t need Nobel laureate teach it. me! I’d even sign test vaccine. Protest outdoor. It’s always better assume anything POTUS says lie. lmao im Madrid 90% wear mask stop spreading bullshit I’m literally boat. don’t asthma obese. Since April went 214 193. I’ve working lot making healthier. shit terrifying. covid 20 years war doesn't? refuse didnt even specify vaccine comes from. 

Pretty sure number would even higher factor China likely first country fomplete Phase 3, poliicization rationalization follows.

Eg. order admit China ahead, media blitz talking vaccines arent safe developed fast, like anti mask campaign March lead many question safety COVID vaccines blocked several Chinese apps!

But still buy medical product cell phones! Chinese cell phones still sell instantly.  Again, sources this? scientists disagree question Oxford's vaccine efficacy, I'm going listen wait better instructions. 

However, I'm yet see scientists so. seen, however, criticism regards companies released information -- barely information, superficial studies, etc. cases, keep eye evolution.

Other that, know expecting sources are. keep saying pressure big factor -- agree, also failed recognize amount money technology invested this, well different intitutions monitoring testings phases study. 

This dangerous territory get into. one thing question, example, Moderna release study proving phase 1 positive results -- highly criticized among scientists time. case proof interest might contrived, Moderna's stocks achieved all-time high day. I'm questioning criticizing process contrived dubious way, time uncertain global community. 

Yet, fail see mentioning real case credible scientist questioning Oxford's vaccine safety/efficacy. far, told contrived speech hidden common sense idea based facts, view vaccine study works. love this. hope still little bit America America. awful everyone can't get results sooner. federal government bundled whole thing. state government awful, good luck...

On positive side, far symptoms that's good.  seems reasonable. Luckily leader several times said vaccines cause autism. Big time leadership It’s simple actually. need UVC light kill thing rather UVA UVB. companies looking UVC solutions it’s different beast much dangerous two regard effect humans. answer wait lots people dying needlessly say ""How happen?!"", proceed shutdown eventually, economy tank anyways, shift blame whomever can. American way. write bar hops?

Its millenial Democrat garbage Blue cities swarm bars. 
Not fearful corona old people. 

Yall probably typing bar. 

Loser dishonest leftists. 🤮 Story: ""an account past events someone's life evolution something.""

You wanna go depth ""he go care?"" curfew 10am noon sundays also Abbott started caring virus week. Stop strawmanning. Dude. definatley thinks okay. Along media. bring becauze obvious double standard. Dont go outside without mask social distancing unless protected class protesting. benefit much either keep screwing up?? guess audio disaster press conferences given us clues shitshow org.  gone away yet? Heard would. Reminder- Post-weekend case numbers daily numbers, they’re numbers weekend processed day Well mean death rates trail active cases. Regardless deaths worried about. longer road recovery flu severe. means longer hospital treatment means higher hospital bills. means possible complications. quite bit reports people still feeling dizzy 4th week. Oh shit, english broke forced script!  right here. Spanish teacher job ever really bad year,I tried looking new job (before covid) literally nothing paid even close make offered full time benefits. four kids. can't quit can't go get new job. People understand. people playing who’ve “died” really good method acting 🤭 Yeah, figured much. We(my family) converted vegetarian diet. Although ate healthy hand, definitely upped game lockdown. Can’t beat sickness eat like shit!!  protest. charge admission sell alcohol. Spray everything bleach. estimation average intelligence actual politicians still downward state flux, trend beginning eighties.

So, yeah, suggestion perfect. means it. need banners China tell people ware masks. Time find new dentist says apps really effective?
In France app detected like 12 people weeks testing. Seems grossly inadequate. Might well give false sense security.
I think swiss government quite irresponsible latest increase ""liberties"". going install untested app may effective X amount population uses it. believe be. Covid spreads via super spreader events. need 1 irresponsible person late. Given amount people acting way assume we're fucked unless harsher sanctions imposed. Nope separate category entirely Florida. Ironically looks like something drunk person would text. mean ones cough spit others intent infect. ones infected covid go party whatever spread dozens people. people treated well? start blaming 20-somethings infantilizing them, let us forget seniors exactly bingo tournaments shuttered. Initial government + businesses talking virus &amp; later pressure government + businesses reopen lockdowns main culprits situation now.

The fact many people abide safety standards consequence opening early + initial talking down(plus talking continues)+American previlage mindset. annoying part entirely possible get infected, mild asymptomatic form infect you. Yes, even part home city closest network hospital. I'm starting hear lot people say pay Florida job horrible, Nurses too? Tf.  hope 1* unprofessional rated Found trumpeter believes anyday trickle economics make one ""millionares"" 

Please vote breed. allowed say get upvoted asked question pretty much answered got downvoted? reddit wrong lol. Unless weather really nice, wanted drive beach. mean, national effort tracing apps, mask requirements, contact tracers localized temporary lockdowns hotspots, really could get control actually effective leadership, fingers crossed *does* get significantly less severe November. Ontario wearing them! kids share bedroom? not, could temporarily could office? siblings slept cots dining room energy crisis 70’s parents didn’t heat upstairs. remember fondly. 

My work home life improved immensely made office guest room. turn lights, close blinds, shut door every day work over. allows separation work home. I’m grateful kids house pandemic option. don’t know parents young ones it. Yet Michigan reported first day deaths says we're still getting conflicting reports. Also WA massive protesting Seattle (King County) aren’t showing spike cases all. county that’s exploded conservative county bunch factory work isn’t anywhere near Seattle. (Yakima you’re curious.) would like see recent source please. Wait... ""feeling symptoms August""... July. Either way, get test then. take 6 year old dentist last week tooth abscessed. new world Covid, dentists dentists. Let explain:

1. Dentist 1 appointment with. arrived 15 minutes early watched (from parking lot) 9 different people enter waiting area without masks on. left without going inside.

2. Dentist 2 required patients wait car. patients (even peds) allowed inside wear mask. staff N95 masks face shields. one patient allowed inside time.

Point being, call around ask Covid protocols are. move ICU patients, preferably. move *before* go ICU. ICU full, difficult move people it. state emergency might decide move people anyway.  bars phase 3, another spike soon after. happy medium tyranny Wild West. 

Given choice though would prefer world like welded house reason all. # TWO Toronto Hospitals. Still awesome, but... c’mon headlines. :-/ virus infects 10,000 people let's say simplicity 1% death rate, 100 people die. mutated, infectious virus infects 20,000 people 1% leaves 200 dead. good portion country given fighting spread virus. slogans told, leadership, hoax, disappear. kind propaganda horribly detrimental health nation. bummer, reality way, time, time. Hahahahaha haha. watched bit dr. fauci's testimony congress, one congressmen asked handle fact many americans reject vaccines...man, fuck get here. know answer, rhetorical question, man..... # would hope. CPU politically hijacked politics in, politics out, regardless issue hand, overriding even survival instinct... many adjacent brain cells fire together, low-quality life decisions may emerge. Let DH outside like BLM. Jesus y’all fucking stupid. would sub personal connection it. start drama can’t complain shit everyday anything don’t go ways. 

They also bunch telling I’m freaking flu back April well. It'd kind like 9/11 every day three years they'd studying similar coronavirus years. We've known masks always effective. 

The virus randomly become infectious march. 

Fauci smart man yet really want us believe single doctor entire world thought makes helpful March? 

Jesus fucking christ top doctor US lied everyone yet trying defend him. 

May god mercy soul. fucked. Ok, Germans potential fasc1sts education isn’t main factor cultural flaws led rise fasc1sm must still around. get headline tad sensationalist, still illustrating well healthcare system citizens diligent handling covid. SWPA (Westmoreland County) Right death rate states 9%. mean actual, mean enough testing previously states. schools open, they'll open weeks dozens staff students test positive coronavirus. schools *will* close. matter when.

An actual quote someone meeting. *by far* annoying thing subreddit: acting like US entire world. live? sweden? life pretty much back normal italy france massive outbreaks. source disproves faulty statement. note units countries vary. People tested (as Sweden Norway instance) solid unit Test performed, since many people healthcare sector tested every week. 100 tested people, could 110 tests performed. Lol yes. Mine too.

Ex: men riding women train cars less crowded car get chased men slapping shit outta it’s either it’s unlikely Germans shed core attitudes led rise fascism country. too! bad people top cant ever get page. think viral apocalypse happening killing thousands millions globally agree anything. Oh wait.... gottem I'm curious, US Americans here: current restricitions yourself? know us lockdowns anymore (I'm Michigan). hanging friends family? are, stay 6 feet apart stay outside? visit restaurants go stores?

My husband seeing people outside least 6 ft. apart, go grocery shopping every week order food to-go want eat out. 3 month old we're extra paranoid me. He's following advice see epidemiologists wants us keep restrictions there's vaccine readily available. 

I'm looking solidarity, know anyone restricted I'm wondering US Americans choosing restrict/not restrict themselves? shall judge people together! 
# 🤝 Yeah, think difficult comparing wages, little benefits security Americans have. making $13, monthly rent 1 bedroom $1,100 plus utl. ($300) So, lived roomates. cheapest health insurance cover anything spent $7,000. So, could afford go doctor. afford car, cost public transportation. So, walk work. 🤷‍♂️

Working outside US blew mind. got 26 paid vacation days, paid living wage, could go doctor sick. could afford smart phone, public transportation wonderful went everywhere. hello trolls, mask surgically attached face there's nothing really ask source kids Korea clean school?  source disproves faulty statement. note units countries vary.

That experience. family, people Master's PhDs generally quite bright many areas life, grasping bullshit Facebook posts imagine reassurance virus big deal. 

I think comes emotional problem. Rather like joining cult, except cult enormous entire TV channel dedicated many people surrounding also it. Whites America likely vote Trump Trump big supporter masks really even mentioned going COVID lately, many followers minds. mean ex-boyfriend? Covid becomes non-issue really doubt people continue wear masks. currently huge issue plenty people wear anyways... made point school district said still plan us campus remote teaching. Can’t wait see us people finally admitting it’s airborne. missing something here. would Hill negative towards Abbott? know, support ! get major health issue? Lives stake battle getting worse. astounds narrow focused politicians concern people preconceived image themselves. That’s going lose court 1A threatens compliance really need people do.

Bye, Karen. live Eastern Washington visited Kelowna past couple years. lovely cosmopolitan little city, maybe growing bit fast good nice respite crazy country.

Not year. Sigh. think right Mexico enforces border measures. live border city one active cases country also county side also alarming number cases. 
Mexico bad news paint it, saturated hospitals, could much better closing borders essential travel way go think. posted state sub think important, I'm getting downvoted. depressing see people take virus seriously  did... months ago said us going run beds ventilators even precautions taken... wrong far states leftist thing say would say that? I’m curious CDC say traveling spreads virus? Canada actually 22 percent lower public mask usage USA everyone I've spoken to, masks temporary vaccine treatment, least situation control like countries. think would cool became like Asian countries people wear masks cold sickness consideration others. masks masks. block viruses; even make yourself. Still, imagine reason get airplane now, anybody. includes business people diplomats. hysteria stupidity something worse? Notice similarities social media engagement. Confected outrage leading rebellious colloquially means ungovernable emotional excess refer temporary state mind emotion; however, beginning 1900 B.C., hysteria considered diagnosable physical illness females 1500s shifted mental illness. classroom doesn’t even windows open. live right across border PA yeah ones wearing mask. saw old man jogging one on. run what's excuse? Sorry point lost you. Hopefully infect kill anybody. First major outbreak started China, yes, PANDEMIC start China. Flattening curve keeping numbers ever rising point exceeds hospital capacity. can't slow things expect hospitals prepared let things rip. That's never going happen. continuously keep numbers controllable levels whatever restrictions necessary. SMH going found schools next thanks certain court That’s funny, keep hearing loudly repeatedly trump bootlicks “everyone free testing go get it” yet article... HMMMM Ever since outdoor dining opened everyone seems stopped taking seriously. I'm 90% sure we'll see second wave coming weeks. Probably Florida levels, definitely significant increase now. 8 days kind short quarantine Covid... absolutely correct... *however*...

What I've seen hospitals ICUs converted staff ICU nurses tend handle direct patient care nurses handle majority things like documentation, med admin, timely vital checks, etc. 

So like ways around this. good hospitals always figured ways things well, bad hospitals always figured ways things poorly. necessarily new thing. Guys, like we're episode Always Sunny Philadelphia! Gang Goes Corona!

No surprise. There's non-insignificant percentage people watch Always Sunny view main characters role-models. u really unless run one like make contact. Crocodiles hunt, however find SE FL. That's first thing thought too... Good bot I'm state college local well student. [They care faculty, either.](http://www.statecollege.com/news/local-news/faculty-say-concerns-were-ignored-in-penn-states-reopening-plan,1483465/) think Penn States ""COVID task force"" makes main decisions university including monitoring, testing, deliver education consisted 2% faculty. may wording poorly essentially allow teaching faculty (other Dr. Ferrari personally study used movie Contagion case study...) onto covid decision making teams, actively ignored concerns. 
Penn State wants money nothing else. gonna sound like weird question- Would trust someone Germany?

Germany responsible worst human rights violations nation. German culture facilitated abuses. believe education alone can’t fix problems like that, logically speaking trust Germans. Must beaches nothing like normal here. people spread 6 feet. Maybe 20 tbh... say 25% normally looks like.. feel guilty giving child social interaction. point children low-risk spread low-risk poor outcomes catch anything. It’s important children get maintain much normalcy daily lives can, zoom doesn’t cut it. Well awkward Trump. Ah yes, someone trying tell someone Toronto saw person real. I'm sick gaslighting bullshit. Yes. research see it. Upvote poppycock. Angels fan chance? I've said I'll say again, need laws place impose giant fines kind activity seems thing people understand. Americans wanting need make caravan, push through. last name Kim. first name Jong Un. sure Dong is... feel you. grip strength right hand approaching cosmic levels. juvenile short sighted almost like China decided domestic PPE production supply critical strategic need, reacted intelligently ensure adequate production supply foreseeable future. competent government supposed do? question implying 10,000 multiple days worth cases. post responded talking time lags results verses initial infection. I'm sure getting tbh. exactly nearly-desperate understand. Well record setting flu season year everybody kind stopped talking Covid thing got wound global furor emerging coronavirus pandemic masked one worst influenza seasons record, government data show, particularly among children young adults. far season, U.S. Centers Disease Control Prevention recorded 36 million flu cases U.S., 370,000 hospitalizations 22,000 deaths. March 7, CDC reports, ""hospitalization rates children 0-4 years old adults 18-49 years old highest record age groups, surpassing rate reported 2009 H1N1 record numbers, influenza ignored, says Dr. Roger Klein, molecular pathologist Yale University. ""There's little mention Yep. happened every country even States like New York. soon people start considering fact get hospital care needed, people freak TF out. listed percent instead count beds remaining? unnerving, given Covid outcomes diabetics. doubt possible ever get herd immunity still influenza common cold lab classes reduced enrollment (~50%) mandatory ppe. sure look like reality ""Yeah close except 80% businesses haHAA"" took seriously... Sniiiffffff. Uh stinks... nice good... aren’t paid enough stop reopening ***during pandemic.*** lol course case numbers lower weekends. Everyone enjoying summer, bothering get checked out. monday tuesday rolls around still feel good get tested. numbers higher week. flip side many hospitals dedicating ICU's covid patients help keep isolated patients. plenty ICU beds free Tampa area, hospitals. 

The real problem comes if/when run overall ICU beds. curve we're trying flatten system-wide, specific hospital. Telling hug regret?  Seriously. hide hand sanitizer decided fling put other’s seats. Illnesses spread school like wildfire normal year. sick every couple weeks teaching tried touch homework. plastic barriers they’ve shown news desks won’t work either that’ll drawn covered within week.

We’ve seen bad kids school. get so, much worse school. know parents need childcare work. get it. It’d better let kids anyone watch go school, kids parent home stay home. might get complicated implement, truly win-win situations here. better containing virus others isn’t priority, apparently. Public washrooms probably thing want avoid most. Let tell something. People looking risk assessment decide whether going get street. they're desperate enraged want justice. 120,000 people died covid. constitution doesn’t protect equal opportunity bungling pandemic. Save energy something else, please One 13, another 18.

I live town around 30k people ICU nearly triple like think customers going rude anyway, “excuse” dick poor service worker. told friend say still spit drink mask on... I've done 4 Uber rides past month 1 drivers wearing mask. kind interesting rides made agree Covid rules (no symptoms wear mask) specifically noted driver wearing mask picked up. Apparently policy going well far. Dude, insane. 50 states re-opened. donkey states 2-6 weeks slower. mind blowing originally virus hit donkey states elephant states pointed laughed. hitting elephant states donkey states exact thing. Pointing elephant states laughing even states also completely re-opened too. level politicization astounding. live NJ everyone acting like shit ancient history South. Third wave come! extent though even though acknowledge majority many people much better emotionally physically. biggest obstacle physically healthy time free time able get better shape focus things stay consistent. Also I'm highly introverted time given time tend hobbies interests could never grow tired of. may miss time job lab great opportunity focus things life. quite optimistic, would say well half population complete morons, many dummies. One lot? I’m hearing similar stories Ohio. Nice graph! use make it? 

I think would inverted numbers displayed available amount. 

Your graph kind makes 100% full hospitals look like they’re standing tall proud, makes sense. literally care less think. want think I'm mad go right ahead. keep patting back defending murderers rapists abusers. won! Hurray! blm protestor know came positive covid test. Damn problem – till first student/teacher brings covid school. Sorry hear this. need least N95 respirator protect you. Difficult, one wearing it. People understand less speak wearing mask, might problem teacher. wear masks, switch every week online classroom schooling, 50 % classroom. Still allowed take theit masks desks. Even daughter found own, important time wear would speaking... looks like virus saturation/statewide hospital shortages norm *just* time schools reopen. really should, world much reliant virulent aggressive plague (that means relying victims developing extreme symptoms they'd spread disease) prevent another plague pandemic. opinion, that's dumb, especially know there's antibiotic resistant strains. """"They feel dismissed. feel listened to. feel hopeless,"" Bishof says regards people responded survey. goal get many people possible take bring medical professionals.

It's ICU patients lingering effects. know % people facing kindof long lasting symptoms. Georgia Tech problem significant price difference online on-campus degree courses.

Read original post:) keep choosing anti parasitic drugs tout next anti viral cure? First malaria drug dewormer. Following Musk's ventilator success.  Argentina expecting one worst years 21st century. Lockdown great initial impact, gone long.

Companies cannot pay salaries cannot fire either. way go bankrupt kind temp humidity together nearly impossible. this? said around, yes talking pinellas. Guys need advice. wife's family house town outside Tampa want fly Jersey August. can't seem convince go 😔

All keep saying everyone's taking precautions wearing masks Yeah. Unfortunately exactly best control group. Stay safe friend. many ICU beds 
Maybe 10 so? hospital 
Pay attention every word banning travel China wasn’t virus, xenophobic agenda. 0.26 number based study John Ioannidis, almost got fired Stanford Med bogus methodology.

Nope. derived CDC's independent study. Thanks playing I've seen points IFR 0.5-0.7%

I would probably agree beginning epidemic. aggressively putting people ventilators. turns unnecessary also would imply right ~25M infected there's long way go.

Sounds like want lot death calamity. Why? need least share employees. understand govt doesnt force disclose cases, wholeheartedly disagree it. information allow people make better choices. Similar would happen nuclear weapons ever used respect Trump right strategy: fewer tests. It’s brilliant! Fewer tests = fewer confirmed cases. Genius. I’m thinking might work cancer, too. former Tampa Bay area nurse, want point ICUs stay 80% full regular night. Central Florida prepared this. unhealthy comorbid area nation barely enough beds deal regular. would CONSTANTLY get patients supposed get ICU beds working surgical step-down unit limit many patients nurse given. 

Good riddance good luck hell hole. Professors also put position “police” students following/not following policies. It’s unsafe. mean pretty fair generalization though. I'd say 90 percent sub usually doom gloom anybody questions things gets blasted pretty quick. Stop whoring data. downgrade clamshell. screenshots pay.

Which grossly overstate much actually make. better was. Story time!!!

So, don’t kids. Probably won’t ever any. big part young dad decided bunch kids couldn’t afford good idea. age 10 responsible taking care younger brothers sisters school 8 dad girlfriend got home work. also, often times, responsible getting younger step-sister ready kindergarten school making sure caught bus. 

I didn’t get normal kids young responsibilities. 12 taking care 6 yo, 2 yo infant 3-8 every day. also expected laundry dishes. didn’t get go friends houses hang school. hard homework, lead bad homework habits high school years. didn’t go college grades weren’t good enough “acted out” breaking rules way got fun. 

I almost 40 going college get degree Engineering (with 3.6 GPA). youngest sister 21 years younger graduated year track go college (took college courses high school earn hs college credits) going way ahead age. makes wonder life would like able kid kid, instead, realize now, tried things young adult instead. really put behind could been. makes really resent dad now. 

Anyway, moral story, let kids kids. them, doesn’t mean get slave labor 18 years. Chores helping different live maid/nanny.  right current resurgence driven 20-somethings 30-somethings. buddy's wife lecturer UCLA university actually keeps track students, faculty &amp; staff who've infected since beginning pandemic March. Towards end 1st week June flood STUDENTS testing positive, first singly, 3 4+ time (shared apartments). June largely older faculty &amp; staff sporadic basis. simple fact 25 demographic simply can't practice self-restraint socially distance living either congregated dorm setting even off-campus clustered peers. That's like asking college kids refrain sex booze. isn’t actually Denmark. 

Check data mask wearing US actually middle pack comes mask usage western world. Much higher Canada well, much better US. Yeah, might case back then. common knowledge lot cases now. Infact that's chinese travel Europe Americans can't country hitting 50k daily? took less two weeks state go 100,000 200,000 cases — positive test rate keeps rising.

If I’m recalling correctly, back March rate doubling every 10 days. Looks like Florida’s right EI, pandemic bailout. collect normal EI, alternatively get emergency pandemic money(CERB) works $2000 month six months. well everyone thinks it, im TN know lot people dont believe it. can't enforced. Police investigate someone submit report (so basically friend neighbor snitches you). Perhaps TSA CPD airport gate (or train platform, etc) hand forms fill out. driving Chicago, completely unenforceable since can't tell drove from.

The quarantine guideline ***recommendation***, **can't** reasonably enforced. smart, wear mask, wash frequently need go outside. know downvoted. Chinese government taken action ASAP, bad situation right now. Yes, U.S infections, yes reaction pretty mild, reality spread started China, severity censored government. Lee Wenliang prime example.

If China lied, nearly bad position right now. That's reality. People stick head sand pretend happen, un-do China did.

Inb4 Chinese bots start downvoting me. no, I'm American. figure kids young they’ll fine!

What staff professors?

They work ignored rant bc doesn’t apply. isn’t issue like natural disaster airplane crash something random fills ED. ED doesn’t house people 5 weeks limited capacity. go again, wacko.

Sorry live parent's basement learn world Facebook nonsense.

Maybe stop trying blame everyone else issues; especially countries realistically done substantially better job protecting population-- yes, cost complete lock-down, curtailed civil liberties.

But guess what, US least **132,000 people die** due various illnesses caused virus -- many next six countries *combined*.

(China 4600 deaths)

And virus keeps raging across States, greater numbers infections so-called ""stay home"" period -- number likely double.

But keep blaming China shitty state America. completely true. Whatever flu strain chase guessing game. Couple years back strain thought prominent turned be. So, flu vaccine year literally useless. remember worse season....but nothing like covid-19. literally 1 ventilator hospital...and sister hospital downstate begging come take it. virus although respiratory component deadly due coagulation issues causes patient. Lots hemodynamic issues. Never seen normal flu a,b comes yearly. LOL aunt moved AZ. thought stores still hitches tie horse AZ. florida now.. hardly anyone beaches here.. places open still hardly anyone. Everyone distant eachother.. can't beleive gullible people media.. literally takes quick second using head realize tests available return results. Media got caught showing old pics trying pass present fit narrative.  sacrifice they're willing make live Boston. less two months ago, number cases time period since test far, far lower before. no, going way higher.

Thanks addressing least important part comment though. wish would kinda see precaution people wear them. got friend wear one shocked often touching mask, scratching mask, etc. near constant. know surface transmission lot unlikely touching ATM keys public door handles. pointed got super defensive kept fidgeting whole time. know getting downvoted. lived Florida years even know Clearwater big beach people went to. Correct. happy see cops forcibly remove her. think happens times, people comply. Looks like sucker getting started. last four months pre-game warm-up. Time buckle chin straps. Beautiful British Columbia.... China course. 🤣 NL opened restaurants first. Even now, sitting 1.5 meters distance. 100 persons? reservation can’t say much health systems mine fairing well. Also, socially distance want beach... take shit. underestimate ability stay away human life. Gave business/financial/budget pressure opened soon. probably needed another weeks ""mostly shutdown"" lot things remaining closed long (like indoor dining bars). restrictions incoming state travelers (who's states would exploding cases) would slowed infection rises. even mayor says ""Remind Me"" 2 weeks. driving.....I see people driving Karen. sub probably type people wear mask car too. 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ year that, 2017-2018 season, 79,400 deaths. think kind silly. million stupid dangerous counterproductive things president did, pick one single thing least slightly proactive? yes it’s always going hard ban people single country getting zero holes Hmm.Good point making things little better getting people something versus something won't. Thank support. Fuck fElon. Officials: *alarmed*.
Also Officials: going anything it. job, responsibility.

/s Yep. RN here. Honestly, people blatantly take risks non-essential recreational activity get citations sign waiver waiving rights treatment get COVID. Docs, nurses, RTs, CNAs, etc DYING selfish folk think it’s right put others huge risk go bars whatever even public health officials saying every damn day so. lock drug users self-destructive habits, won’t even slap hand literally causing essential workers die negligence. 700+ healthcare workers died US COVID far. Humanity needs sane people raise kids. Imagine society people kids actual shitbags. Exactly weeks Oh, thought testing , think testing somehow making people , stop I've seen personally Delaware. 'Declared pay' part Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act legal obligation total pay fighter.

As long agree that, rest opinion. particular vaccine failure lol. Since none interventions ever seem pay off. *sigh* Look hyperbole. dictionary. Google. Go ahead. I'll wait. Prevents, no, lesson number deaths, yes talking about? July 3rd 460 cases, second highest since March. michigan/gov/coronavirus. fact soaring, cases nearly doubling one day start month half peak highs. No, mean largest. lot cartels even business analysts operate like corporation. know x-percent drugs get seized price accordingly. ok letting doctors die order force people wear masks guess much care dead teacher. Deaths require certification cases. Sunday almost always low point week. amplified Friday holiday. get foh job want money. Oh right can’t hang. someone pisses off, even mouth words behind mask instead thinking them. people insist dumb Yeah they're hook murder first degree. I'll take chances. We're sending best people. not? It’s lower one percent functioning hospital system. beds doctors due overcapacity, number jumps several percent. media overhyped virus try defeat Trump's reelection.  Tampa, city article talking about, also wear mask Turns system runs cruelty stupidity corruption can't quite rise occasion. Oops? protect family best point. Would rather wall built MILLIONS CORPSES?

Perhaps monument authoritarian overreach, something accurately encapsulate virtue shutting lunchroom 1% peanut allergy, hmm? 🤔 

Go ahead though, please re-explain severity COVID let’s see whether personal take anything hasn’t already endlessly regurgitated via mouthpiece politicians corporate controlled popular media.

Sincerely,

“Fucking sociopath” Shotgun. *grin*

Actually, I've started carrying metal cane. I've used prop times lines people get close. ""If touch close. touch hit you."" ""No one could imagined this."" Repubelican mantra. Yeah I’m rural midwest right couple days, Trump flags, masks, even saw confederate flag hanging pickup truck yesterday. MINNESOTA. Even employees stores aren’t wearing masks. Worse differential health outcomes based upon race the
ill person. 50 years swallowing hateful treatment society 
government, imagine survive nearly suffocated death?
Then throw socioeconomic differential higher probability of
exposure air water pollution. 

Since less 10% racial minority voters going vote keep same
chief let die anyway? suddenly makes Trump’s refusal wear
a mask support social distancing seem less stupid much sinister. Yup. Arizona beaches, look us. Shocked Kirk Face someone please find ja rule ask thinks?  Dumb offensive cartoon. going compare something, would compare seatbelts, though vaccination may apt comparison. huge fan since teen. Always ton respect her. said, right. 100%

I Walmart yesterday NY state. many people wearing masks.

Oh people yahoo saying liberal. literally gun owner heard Texas. never talked political views 17 years I've fan. guarantee, conservative. sure people thought political views anything calling people Karen's wearing masks though. Weird. said may three weeks death death reported. context, extremely important lag. said yourself. true, get point large percentage community infected large crowds outside going start add problem way before.

Places surges hospitalizations absolutely need lock anything essential yesterday. WW2 Japan’s government responded people “just need learn live it”, daily bombings fires. 

I’m quite certain government taken approach ever range reasons. 

“Just live it, press on” 

With that, sadly bet schools opening loud morons continue rule day. neighbor put tent yard create ""Work Fort"". He's got everything he'd need comfort get work done without distraction.

Need Dad? He's Fort, call text. Haha! excited show us; like kid building tree fort. sure anyone help me, need resource report pretty egregious violations workplace. boss refusing let people wear PPE says creates false sense security - social distancing, protection, etc. client company mandated facemasks, nobody cares. company hundreds semi truck drivers interacting daily basis!

There several cases already, going get worse! 

This Montgomery County, TX - executive order passed 3 days ago *mandating* use masks.

For life *can't find resources!!* idea get facts to, *all* end disease neck woods? help appreciated! Literally much hate Trump damn thing would've done made difference. starters virus already long asymptomatic people never getting tested. Delete nonsense Yep. teachers often pensions, depending whether kids/a working partner/etc, may enough live retire earlier. Right now, lot household's incomes fucked up-I highly doubt teacher who's partner lost income could justify retiring themselves. So, chance people might need wear masks even they're home?

I know, need eat, I'll take mask. So, chance wind could spread virus end getting contaminated? Drinking outside massive thing UK. people migrated parks pubs. Nation fucking functional alcoholics. need portable UV light One coworkers late 60s. loves job kids. He’s type man retires he’ll probably die soon after. 

But I’m worried immunocompromised goes chemo treatments twice month. know needs job health insurance, job might actually kill him. schools full reopen would guess half teachers get Covid.  Good news! new tenure positions opening soon! Idk you’re voted Lots bad takes comments- perhaps article wasn’t detailed enough discussion topic. See ads little scientific didn’t spell wrong, really utilize google look definition word challenge it. 

It’s autocorrect misuse word learn third grade. making shit up? packed bar restaurant local hospitals ICUs overflowing . . . can't grasp it.

Yeah foolish may 10% us, cause lot problems. 60% alcohol hand sanitizer kills it, let's try drinking Bacardi 151 block 3 4 people newsfeed couldn’t take idiotic unscientific rants Coronavirus anymore. Yup, uncle skin cancer nose avoided getting treatment got bad go er. couldn’t afford chemo won’t give chemo unless pay front don’t insurance. consult bat boy. I'm going guess fall certain political persuasion likes allowed discuss here... believe lot fake things hoax masks work entire virus ploy make one side political spectrum look bad other. Ya however well-intentioned, eroded faith government time really needed honest facts. I've using thick bandanas hand towels... sadly, Queens NY started notice people using nothing past week grocery trips. People getting complacent and, make things worse already are, supposedly national leadership going pivot to, ""ehh, live it"" tomorrow. Gluttony fall group filed April still nothing. lie skirt rule pretty clear understood rule meant break it. 

I wonder many people think avoiding corona clever ruse.

Close border, Canada! 

We're sending best people. Airborne virus droplet would serious change. Many masks used rated airborne virus would minimally effective. Virus tiny, crappy mask might keep droplets stop airborne virus. 

If thing airborne south ravaged summer north get later fall, winter people huddle indoors. may paywall link. Here's [another link article. knowledge subject bit rusty even death row one executed since 2006??? Guessing many awaiting appeals? Random gripe “lockdown” misnomer year. think they’ll try another stay home though answer question. question successful they’ll though people still house parties whatnot expect Karens go Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana go mall get haircut. interesting see long lasts well anyone else follows. start week, could probably lift around Labor Day slower reopening. cannot put blanket statement school education students don’t behave it’s due bad parenting. 

I disagree you. caveat physiological issues small minority young people have, poor behavior children due bad parenting. includes (in days yore) running around restaurants, screaming, responding teachers instructions anything ""yes sir"" ""yes ma'am"" compliance.

Oslo 1.0 per thousand, Sweden 0.37. know group unlikely get seriously sick. Across age groups, Sweden 6.9 / 1000 Oslo 4.16 / 1000. insane. Because, honestly, pandemic softball him, he’d handled better could huge achievement re-election. listen scientists spent entire lives studying epidemics, say. That’s literally do. instead turned gigantic clusterfuck literally killing Americans every day. thought trials underway. anyone know? HEAVILY ABUSED Americans, Chinese!

Moreover, Chinese tourists value life, Canada popular travel destination (comparing SEA, Japan Europe) Chinese anyway. Chav Lives Matter

You also look ICU admittance, posted too. numbers better sense reported earlier (deaths occur later cases).

Why would anyone bother edit parts viral gene contribute SARS-CoV-2's ability infect humans? aware 4% difference two viruses functional changes, right?  differences essentially nothing?

That's biggest giveaway mutations produced SARS-CoV-2 random happened time.  human going spend incredible effort required make ineffectual changes viral genome ""make look natural"".

Besides that, arguing newer mutation that's become dominant spreading faster engineered too? That's part 4%, recent change - G614 spike variant.

Then even write article? always open deaths latest 7-10 days reliable deaths reported.

On one hand, right... hand, even numbers deaths increasing, pointing data last week saying ""it's decreasing"".

They knew perfectly well people would follow historical numbers kept increasing, would look tail end graph see curving downward. could honest numbers, totally dishonest interpretation numbers. Also federal government provided leadership resources states, contract tracing payments keep people home instead going work shitty jobs pay rent. lockdowns solution itself, supposed buy time keep hospital capacity manageable got caught infrastructure. federal government needed pump bunch money resources response, failure going end much costly long run. absurd. ask 3.5 year old watch make sure brother doesn’t fall court run bathroom, ask get diaper find toy brother, make point talk brother sing song.

.. ideas fix bigger comfortably people's heads. Soooo..... anyone know people contract this? roommate said regular medicine makes worse. people eating chicken soup hoping die? occasionally read news, Fox main source information, believed Trump De Santis called hoax, heard sick elderly affected, anything keeps going fun.  beautiful day, 4th weekend, let's go play.

Modern life evaluating sources information, ignoring misinformation. People filtering well going get sick. lifetime Reno resident, promise first year visit lake. hope stay COVID free. anyone tell new Port Richey area like all? well, make sense, im sure plenty non-violent felons too. ive met genuinely good people got caught stupidity couldnt figure survive record. one person particular im thinking ended committing crime go /back/ jail. surely could figure restrictions help people get rehabilitated. whatever could come wouldnt matter end day. nice username btw. People yell service workers reason absolute worst. United States slowly eroded education reality subservient money machine.

😔 Goodness sake. you, Spanish inquisition? already told you. happens Coronavirus kills black Americans police violence? risk assessment here. Google apple government already knows location. think wilfully naive. Ah ok thanks yeah, good position. got severance nice nest egg saved up. either us find work Nov 1, fine. Yuo need mask stop larger droplets get inhaled else hit floor within 30 seconds. Boston nowhere near percentage infected. Regardless, many cities look at. San Francisco, Minneapolis, DC, Nashville People alleging insurance fraud rampant hospitals ask insurance companies pursuing charges. Donated blood gets tested every thing. Best part free! would thought businessman would err side business? Maybe businessmen uniquely well suited run society. Maybe they're prone biases verge inhumane?

Large droplet, yes, cloth mask I’ve worn still allowed fog mirror projected totally “unfiltered” air past nose eyes. actual scientific study mask effectiveness I’ve seen hamster study month ago. research published still assuming it’s effectiveness humans? dont offend me.

Also, people old usually get autopsy. say ""natural causes"" call day. 1. Breaks coronavirus rules political speech.

2. make argument protest. Ok buildings shared airflow like apartments/condos, circulates entire building without barriers right? everybody getting exposed it. guess wearing P100 respirators common areas useless then. course masks important reduce virus transmission, death rate. Perhaps Japanese good treatment strategy? use Favipiravir quite widely far seems promising drug. argument Tedros confrontational Brundtland distinct argument demonstrated interest ""supporting few.""  Winston Churchill (?) said, going hell...keep going. watched Hamilton today, looking forward going back theatre. Might years hopefully one day..  doctors real! Christian page like Facebook told /s backfiring huge places.

I get politicians, especially republicans, big businesses’ pocket. it’s businesses best interest encourage mask wearing. everyone compliant, we’d likely able go stores, planes, events, school, etc. safely! lot could open up.

But much population rabidly antimask, we’re seeing huge spikes places opened indoor activities. would companies shoot foot?

I think pure riling base election year/Trump’s insecurity. really apples oranges.

US cities fucking huge, houston metro almost 25,000km2 denmark,as country, 40,000km2 denmark twice population density. First off, also confident Artem lizard. Secondly, best wins Gabriel Gonzaga Matt Mitrione. loses big nog, Roy Nelson, Ben Rothwell, Andre Arlovski, shitty Travis Browne. Brenda C- tier UFC fighter, obviously could beat 98% average Joes Nope that's allowed. citizen Alaska returning home lower 48 this. delivery person sick, cough food, delivers right think could transmitted Freddie touches bags???

Wow. Just....wow. I'm sorry truth hurts. Isn’t slippery slope though? Like you’re “risking life” everyday work you’re naturally gonna think “fuck I’m gonna go blow steam party. 3 weeks us. School board votes 7/9 ""the plan."" warning anti maskers every country Europe, Mexico Canada want countries, state’s don’t even want travel there! really need federal guidance leadership, get here? wife teacher Canada.

Also fucked.

Good luck! ebike ride even fucking exercise. Keep open. Strictly mandate masks. Provide lots sanitizer. Rep convention still scheduled Florida, cancelled? Yes. waffles useful leave ‘guidance’ people follow accord. majority won’t course.

Mask compliance UK terrible. wore condom foot. many kids. varies lot state, though. hospital, like 4.5k routine vaginal birth, including everything. pandemic effect everyone. concerned judgements. least area country case count exploding. everybody grocery store morning actually mask on. Small miracles. vast majority us, yes. people whose entire families wiped virus? Probably easy mode them. Yep. people massed near US relative's house day, screaming, lives next door prominent health official...the chance locking society people can't even stop threatening officials non-existent. Abbott death process. examples mask usage alone accounted reduction? Michael Osterholm one top epidemiologists world, points many studies coming flaws, often conflate data surgical cloth masks two different things. I've encounter one those, shown mask higher, shouted healthy. :/ I'm blaming anyone walking around public without mask, point care pissed at. Lol. seen army? That’s one reason polite... don’t want piss anyone off, especially “friends” South. :) point *theory* backed evidence yet. all, example communication went completely wrong, mainly media outlets going dramatic headlines. talking incidence happened around 14th january, (as far knew) less 100 infections. Scientist outside asia still know related earlier circumstantial reports.

[The post twitter](): *""Preliminary investigations conducted Chinese authorities found clear evidence human-to-human transmission novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified #Wuhan, #China🇨🇳.""*  
[Press conference](): *""Epidemiologic reports way waiting results these, yes certainly possible limited human-to-human transmission.""* definitely sounds like underestimation, support claim there's human-to-human transmission.

The moment *we* realized something terribly wrong 10 days later, 40 (reported) deaths, state media reported 2 hospitals built Wuhan days time. That’ll happen too. fair good survive air conditioning system, masks limit amount spittle whatnot released air, making less likely massive amounts fact linger air enter indoor air circulation systems. Masks mitigation strategy, complete prevention. us perfectly capable worrying multiple problems time, entire nation children falling year half behind education rest world moves huge problem. tougher vote? don’t overly follow American politics Dying malfunctioning lung two separate relevant things. I'd like fine higher like I'm South Korea.. Like mom daughter flew US SK, ignored quarantine, went around shopping/dining caused 14 days quarantine everyone came contact tested positive. fines six figures plus liable loss income/wages dozens people Americans think Obama made government propaganda citizens legal government would use propaganda push agenda? without reason. read wondering short vaccine point? go public matter time till get exposed. Going bars restaurants course make quicker. thing hope control viral load go mildest case possible? Yet finding interesting things everyday. Like people getting regular flu shots may affect happens get exposed. know can. 

But damn feel older folks morning. Republican convention still scheduled Florida? WRONG. Thos AMERICAN CITIZEN wife executive company USA transferred Canada. do

If kill fast enough, nothing else kill might convince fair chunk antimaskers support it.

I imagine working well tbh, unless influencers follow get program first. They'd see deception play.

""Those sh e e ple think slapping American flag pattern gonna make buy stuff? Nah. American flag tool p pression oxymo r on."" Say goodbye tourism. pointed amazing many Americans think phrase ""always there"" ... *sigh* short memories. Shut fuck up. banned. Lockdowns actually last option. 60 local outbreaks, one ended lockdown unable trace origin. rest sucessfully traced controlled, require lockdown. Yeah there's way open schools, imagine strikes teachers refusing go, early retirement older ones. Even proposals put none really seem good idea, proposals take account teachers various staff schools, focus kids.

And also, doubts able enforce masks, definitely trouble lower grades. Anyone brain tell kids gonna keep em day, they'll take em joke around mess teachers kids. gonna shitshow. People like saying sensationalism are, IMO, trying downplay it. Downplaying thing got us, (states downplayed didn’t listen experts) isn’t situation. Millions people killed false sense comfort aren’t right things help curb pandemic. fucked talking like dangerous. Also anything sensationalized 24 hour news cycle. It’s story again, effect. Switch news source listen weekly podcast instead focusing everyday. lot better mental health wish people it. Instead got people going crazy amping ho reading negative shit non stop.  Omg downvoted. people brainwashed two party system ""not Trump"" need run. May well make literally anyone president then. P attached private parts. I'll put way, current director general job. concerned upsetting individual member states. interfered ability lead international committee global mission.

I believe one former leaders, Dr. Brundtland, much better believed international bodies prepared lead necessary, rather bossed around powerful nations. “If job direct coordinate global health, it’s question one several governments ask do,” said. “We working humanity.”

Brundtland pushed use local contacts, diplomatic channels emerging internet locate potential outbreaks, made organisation less reliant national governments information. Within years, strategy proved worth. November 2002, Chinese government became aware first cases novel respiratory disease, later named Sars, failed alert WHO. But, part Brundtland’s new approach, staff monitoring Chinese medical message boards news media anyway, aware thought atypical pneumonia outbreak. Adding suspicions, 10 February 2003, David Heymann, executive director WHO’s communicable diseases cluster, received email son former staff member China warning “strange contagious disease” already killed 100 people, “not allowed made known public”. took information China, made first official report next day.

Although formal powers monitor censure members, Brundtland wasn’t shy anyway. ensuing months would accuse China withholding information, claiming outbreak might contained “if able help earlier stage” exhorting Chinese “let us come quickly possible!” remarkable speed, China fell line shared data WHO. “After statements China, countries hesitated,” said Heymann.
""

The WHO, organization, necessarily type authority might expect, leader exercise influence accomplish mission. failing give objective critique China's early response, accepting data obviously falsified, failed global mission. Maybe that's poor? kind polucy decimate birth rates... mean, okay... Something something Florida man archive [http://archive.is/oyzRj](http://archive.is/oyzRj) Well ya job transfer that's essential got influenza B March(only actually went doctor COVID got tested flu). shit joke, I’ve never worse body aches/feeling sick. I’m getting vaccine even low chance preventing hell week ever happening again. “They’re looking us heaven, extremely proud record Dow Jones.” Donald Trump future speech probably Kids back school September Spain. Younger kids maskless they'll interacting classmates, even recess, recess times staggered. Apparently that's safe enough.

Older kids maskless seated class wear masks moving around recess. Apparently that's safe enough they'll seated 1.5 meters apart class.

All valid virus airborne. is, we're fucked.

So, teacher Spain, I'm fucked. Thing is, virus seems latent effect half cases, maybe more. People get sick, get better, feel fine, couple weeks later, get pneumonia, heart attack, one kidneys fails. friend got COVID, felt better, heart attack two weeks later passed away. There's telling long term short term effects matter virus have. virus damages blood cells ability utilize oxygen, people get *may* higher risks lot different things rest lives even 'feel fine' immediately afterwards. survived bad bout influenza Tokyo, would make one comment anthropological observations. Australia New Zealand 2017 no. deaths/100,000 population influenza 0.8-0.9. Japan 5. Japan big (the biggest?) elderly population, suggest society structured way respiratory infections less likely. I'd interested age-matched data never found it. reason mentioned asymptomatic spread issue highlight source information. asymptomatic spread known people without symptoms spread disease. looked data disease actually spreading, retrospective form investigation, found asymptomatic people unlikely spread it.

U R DOOMED, foolish gringo!!! brings back original Chinese data 7 percent people ended truly asymptomatic. 

They would test family units would people showing symptoms - following people isolation quarantine 7 percent remained way. 

Which lends credence early studies suggest insignificant percent people show signs illness weil 14 day mark. US, yes, right live wrong country, sorry :(  weren’t cognitive dissonance, side couldn’t make 2 neurons fire form thought. look South Korea try something else deflect.

I know might surprise you, countries Europe distancing less 2m. They've also pubs open. UK, even order wearing masks. actually airborne, we're seeing Europe happening. Oh yeah.. one nurse know pregnant respiratory therapist going quoting OSHA masks effective blah blah. Like lady.. OSHA global pandemic?  lucky area many cases. bout Uruguay death count people understanding this. hospital capacity. someone covid stay 3 weeks ICU eventually gets better, multiplying spikes we're having, hospitals can't handle patients. Then, someone car crash needs hospital care, go? 

That's literally whole point flattening curve. overwhelm hospitals. We're assuming people point going contact disease limit amount people getting time, we're flattening curve. IMHO, next zero data published outcomes death. ready next wave ""I take seriously enough. now. almost died. link GoFundMe, help appreciated. God bless.""

Seriously, he's wrong, social media platforms (e.g. Facebook) literally worst this. People loose sense education via reading shit online. internet proxy make people smarter access much information, sad us humans decide pad utter nonsense.

It's maybe question slip ToS opinion represented fact regard medical issues could ToS big social media... depends air re-circulation, air filtration, air flow, quickly inside air replaced outside air.

An inside space windows door walls open industrial space multiple open bays probably still ok. hermetically sealed office building, much. lot simpler Canada. don’t recall hearing this. Could elaborate? commit atrocities US back. mask response parts America damn abysmal. can’t go hang friends family, safely responsibly?

Instead claim unhealthy cooped up, go f’ing unhealthy thing party without masks SD’ing. Mind blowing decisions people make. Honestly fuck you. We’re country like every country dealing this. hate guy too, comment highlights harshness Israel looked everything. won’t say don’t want give satisfaction, exactly people claiming anti Semitism. human beings really fucking stupid.

Yep. Damn put question mark teleprompter may offer protection long run, protection better none. Bruh what? offers protection long run protecting now? http://files.fast.ai/papers/masks_lit_review.pdf

regardless is, here's paper actually helping. STILL lowers chance contracting high percentage much lower percentage. summer season upon us, terrible news Thanks that. read charts look big scary curve? Look one shows hospital concern levels variety measures. moderately concerned (NOT warning level) increased ICU usage, concerned measure. They’re prepared know, they’re ones day day medical work. media focusing big scary curve, real actual doctors moderately concerned one measure otherwise unconcerned. means: open windows ventilated ways. gives af says wish could retire.

I'm trying lose much weight possible classes start improve chances. gained quite bit weight last pregnancy. I'm worried. Yeah, day chippy guy comes shouting (not angry way) mask regards social distancing. one wearing mask... Irresponsable reporting. letter hasnt even published yet ""It's my right decide whether wear mask not!""
But right wear one. 

That's view masters towards slaves. dont think matters mask ""cool"" not, mask mask Nothing showed x-rays ct scan.

The health department area started putting ads Facebook testing. 

The comments were.... Depressing. Like absolutely depressing. 

Between: ""they're putting database stealing ur soul"" ""I'll die home Thai hoax"" 

I need fucking drink already. Dying adds distance also.. Surprising people would asymptomatic? wear PPE whole trip.

Chinese nationals returning China known take respirators food water 20 hours time avoid infection. http://files.fast.ai/papers/masks_lit_review.pdf time PPE.

It failure planning. One clearly identified UK virus pandemic wargaming would also therefore part parcel pandemic instructions passed Obama's team transition.

Just time works good.

Jesus fucking christ people stupid states. Creamery

Fucked story name gave chuckle lol literally gazillions hand sanitizers market, FDA catching problematic products? 

Is list tested approved? sister party bunch family friends parents found wasn’t going wanted keep two children safe, told snob making political wasn’t taking “constructive criticism” according mom covid won’t go away everyone gets it. India ranks 2 medical tourism industry 1st Singapore Public school teacher here. Let paint High School picture you: 


\- Classes around 30 kids per class (sometimes high 35)

\- Small-ish classrooms limited tables chairs available. Students put table groups 4 save space.

\- Incredibly poor ventilation air-flow, classrooms getting hot stuffy summer freezing winter.

\- one window per classroom may may open.

\- Bathroom breaks discouraged often bathrooms locked shut due inappropriate activities high degree students skipping.

\- lunch, students CANNOT leave building, instead crammed not-big-enough lunchroom. 

\- Lack resources human-power properly clean disinfect classrooms thoroughly often.

&amp;#x200B;

These conditions ALONE create almost perfect-storm type setting virus spread (obviously, non-science-background opinion). Combine many hands-off absent parents, students faculty ignore rules get day, try first/ask questions later mentality higher-ups get terrible situation involved. 

I really solution good luck everyone. PLEASE make voices heard! World class negotiating right here:

""Gilead announced its global price remdesivir June 29 US$390 per vial. 
""The Guardian has reported the cost US government US$3,200 six-day treatment. 
""In contrast, production costs remdesivir estimated at 93 US cents for one day’s treatment, less US$6 entire course."" Even went supermarket day, saw like 4 28 people wearing masks... that’s including workers, prevalence virus low deaths declining risk still there. would love go back clubs black British person, there’s high chance pass mother would could develop severe case, worth it. I’m done, work 3 12’s that’s it, extra time.

I blame you.

Ages ago, nearly pursued medicine (volunteered clinics, took MCAT's, started filling apps) never really clicked. Something becoming physician sit right me.

This pandemic made realized why.

This country healthcare right, people give healthcare professionals respect deserve. I'm gonna put quarter half million debt spend years pursue career advice preventative care glazed I'm subjected verbal abuse (from patients patients' family), mention nasty bugs (including COVID) catch pts too.

I honestly believe stick healthcare work America, kind saint, worth, thank bottom heart done. Oh ffs, no, it’s not. everyone telling going fail, anyway, fail miserably............

What ""too soon"" leave school. 

Don't worry it........it's peoples lives. long Trump likes you, else matters? officials described “alarming” increase, hospitalizations patients confirmed coronavirus infections Los Angeles County jumped 41% last three number patients confirmed coronavirus infections intensive care units 35% last two weeks; Friday, 549 people ICU; last Friday 446, week Statewide, hospitalizations continued upward march; Saturday, California broken daily records number people hospitalized confirmed coronavirus infections 14 consecutive days.

America currently dying 11% It’s crazy normalized mistreating service workers is. It’s classism, one ever talks it. country you? Airborne = virus need media. 
Droplets = Droplets media. posted actual study earlier wonder impact well deceased also experiencing long term effects virus. unable work months year hard pay bills. okay, still stopping SOMETHING. no, never going give 0% chance, make whatever percentage chance getting lower without mask. still transmit via spit aerosols. Going 50% chance breathing virus 30%, 10%, whatever STILL better Thoughts prayers course! Shutting economy hurts poor people much hurts rich people. political speech, stating fact verified thousands thousands times over, anywhere look, giving OPINION government, stating FACT, break rules

any please, means, apply said ""any protest"", go ahead, interesting I'll check out! 1 many insensitive asshole Yes he's asking help not, that's contention, much help. I.e room someone covid what's chance catching mask Vs without mask. could years befor vaccine available sure wouldnt want one first groups taking Thanks. We're going need it. schools included definition ""mass gatherings"" within state's extension state emergency. So... pretty clear path heading. What? ‘stale’? Nobody wants get airboned must better closed windows though, no? plus hotel signed schemes since occupancy zero due lockdowns. Move parents farm KY live life subsistence? could congratulate myselves smarter ""experts"". Instead, would like point innovative things so-called ""shit hole"" countries succeeding failing.

The people running so-called ""shit hole"" countries common sense achieving better results ""experts."" I'm worried sister. receive immunoglobulin hospital every 3 weeks. 

Even treatments, levels dropping. 

I know happens hospital seen gets overwhelmed. Let alone increased risk every time goes. 

It feels like we're months pure hell. guy ever let know pandemic over? need know. Unfortunately much ""collateral damage"" that's nothing new drunks, already ruin lives around them.

There's article floating around shows seating arrangements restaurant superspreader ate Korea. Human sheep transmission tested. know pinpoint young adults. I've seen people ages refuse masks. Mainly older generation kids understand here. young adults area, lot wear masks we're asked ID buy cigarettes alcohol right now. know there's lot young adults teenagers wear reason.

Same fireworks. place asked ID getting fireworks Phantom.

So, unless they're older can't breathe, believe real, drugs, people wear masks. I've cities state single person mom wearing masks. young adults, everybody. Face masks one public access to. 😁👍🏻 wear mask. admit live emotions rational thinking. That’s exactly point. treatments gotten better combination less lethal capacity threshold higher, high enough absorb onslaught cases, perhaps blunt tool like total shut answer. maybe it’s nuanced avoid riskier behavior, mass gatherings prone eclipse threshold didn't.

Do research believe me, things spreading fake experience reddit. subject post airborne transmission droplet *or* aerosol, virus Ontarion agree. would surprised see numbers start rising. many people wearing masks, 4 hour wait get Covid test (so many go feel sick) contact tracing speak of. hope cities mandating masking. knew nasty virus around November/December. son got super sick elderly mom got severe respiratory viruses twice within month. Thank God pulled through. one tell different. Stay home go out. choice phrasing may poor initial comment.

WHO global organization entirely funded 194 member states. Therefore, design susceptible conflict-of-interest issues may partially drive decisions warnings.

IMO, WHO's actions less reflective best interest member states. said interest few, referring China pandemic, countries epicenters outbreaks. leaders displayed lack faith authority international body since outbreak SARS 2003. Maybe Brundtland outlier. Maybe much weakness way evolved succeed mission.

In case, would argue appropriately guided global response pandemic? certainly wouldn't. Yes, don’t Florida Man operating AC. view Israel harshly harsh things does. Try fixing issue instead attacking people object. wield anti antisemitism weapon bludgeon criticism Israel. also causes cynicism towards Israel. Yeah reading would change different distinction - tho read anecdotal evidence doctors fine surgical masks only. 

Don't know true overall - one doc saying one infected hsi hospital using surgical masks b/c enough N95. anyone else remember link remdesivir &amp; heart attacks? Hahah would run other. queen. However, went small cookout yesterday. like 4.5 hours. 15-20 people most. ...fair point Lmao you’re definitely bad logic considering HIV isn’t spread droplets airborne, keep justifying idiot. way y'all actually going trough that? Well yeah.

Going post itself, there's context quoting Trump - agree, ironically? F w. care. I’m sorry work. wish cameras ED ICU showing people it’s really like.  really bad there's black market weapons. articles already appeared March USA decides fuck let’s people catch it

As US citizen watching us crumble stupidity, *does* seem strategy tradition Droplet contamination preventable wearing layers cloth nose mouth (masks).

If virus airborne cloth layers don’t shit.

The prevention airborne virus N95 masks; period.

———

All people giving non mask wearers shit wearing masks, turns wasting breath -and wrong- entire time.

No N95 mask? Enjoy Covid! .... County Barcelona created Charlemagne northern territories Barcelona part ""region"" within empire, Marca Hispanica. think there's strong argument northern territories considered part historical Catalonia (as entities laid claim ruled lands).

Yes concept ""Catalan Countries"" highly controversial. Mm hmm great use time money going name ufc guy bike ride outside better right? western media, Singapore state media. 

And mean make sacrifices travel? opposed what? following guidelines? 

What way sell it. everyone favor traveling? NO. follow rules, comply laws. anyone favor so. duty responsible citizen. 

Don’t try paint picture people sacrificed traveling flock everywhere undo government tried do. 

This attitude similar entitled idiots US resist following guidelines personal freedoms important. 

You follow guidelines China (or government penalizes you) sit high horse attitude everyone favor! Can’t stay shutdown forever without killing economy. purpose shutdown slow infection hospitals get ready. won’t eliminate fully unless vaccine. Coronavirus highly infectious majority eventually get it. 

40% businesses never coming back. 40 million unemployed. Tax revenues tanking cities country. Teachers, police, firefighters, city workers next layoffs shutdowns continues... Access denied :( Among hardest-hit regions rural counties south Central Valley, farmworkers toiling stage vast majority – 90% – farmworkers California Latinx, working precariously crowded environments. 60% workers involved food preparation Latinx well. Latinx, Black minority groups disproportionately infected dying Covid-19, according tracking tool designed UCLA, early metrics suggest state’s reopening exacerbated disparities.

60% CA blacks Hispanics/Latinos, make 46% population. above, plus higher infection rates among younger people. Switzerland increased last weeks dozen new cases day 100-150 per day last days.

It takes rebound low baseline. I’ll jump discussion also. think tipping culture yelling employees result entitled “the customer always right” attitude. “I’m giving money want”. happens customer facing industry including ones without tips like clothes shops, grocery stores, ice cream parlors (although ice cream shops coffee shops may voluntary tip jar throw money register). Personally, I’m paying cash, throw coins don’t worry them. incompetent governments do, slow test fool people one day time, late.  yesterday dealt 4 families infected 20 something children. Everyone level illness. Where's arrogant governor now???? saw running mouth back, berating reporters warned outbreak Florida weeks ago. Two three weeks ago, much happened yet, a, ""See, told so"" moment.......basically laughing reporters faces, politically charged dialog.

Not ignorant now, Ron??? How's feel put foot mouth knee? 

As say, one mouth two ears. Use proportion that. friend who’s nurse shocked day anti-vax bullshit. She’s right lot things thankfully she’s vaccine spacer vaccine denier floored someone educated could ignore science hard. couple years ago heard guy work another crew wore mask work cold got made fun crew lead eventually told take off. unfortunate stigma associated masks here. sense total numbers money lost. 

Make comparison % income lost get back us. tickle brain. swab back throat... show clip saying this, fuck never post lies again? assume helps droplet spread. Please use correct language peer reviewed studies reached definitive consensus. Somebody already analysed it’s opposite contraception exists one money moment Great Question; theory US handled better additional month prepare 2 oceans protect us.

I think main reason US political leaders political reason (and still are) downplaying seriousness virus process turned common sense measures like wearing masks partisan issue. That, coupled disdain experts, caused US never hunker way Europe did. Asymptomatic rarely spread virus? correct? apologize. misunderstood saying. crashes bike? car breaks way there? hills particularly busy day?

It’s one thing say, “I don’t it, need stay home?” wrong, get it. It’s another actually confirmed test refuse stay home. Regardless many people think might see, huge piece shit. Full surprises you, tell water wet! way get young healthy infected? there's herd immunity? literally done nothing since March. love teaching, sad think would safe return. miss students, kept tutored summer free via Zoom. can't find solution require put health risk? fit young person, conditions make vulnerable disease. fire me. Fire 60 year old teacher team dedicated life teaching. Fire teachers asthma. Fire us replace us, watch teachers die too. Oh, pay taxes too. right Pt major issues, somehow think massive spread dangerous virus greater danger. wear mask dinner rush? feel like that's wear most. Sorry deal this. foresee yet another US memorial dedicated brave lives lost due selfish acts some. aspect culture, cannot look head see memorial erected makes feel hopeless extremely sad. lives need lost. I've never prouder country neurological virus sets autoimmune response attacks weakest links system like autoimmune disease. Thus vaccine work. Trump actively gaslighting entire country sowing distrust facts, evidence Science. Joe Biden even absolutely nothing, would massive improvement, would hard quantify. used tell people back Jan co fronted provide sources sources good enough old account banned. RGV may famous, Raynosa-McAllen metro area population 1.5 mil. small town news horrible. suspicion 1.5 2m rule become standard public health mantra easy communicate compatible limited economic activity. worked medical advisers politicians. going prevent transmission indoor venues people spend extended periods like offices, school restaurants. chronic cough unrelated germs infection. course people don’t know it’s cause. 
   jacket season, cough, tuck mouth collar coat it’s much better coverage elbow. 


In end January purchased box disposable masks experiment wearing subway woman sitting front standing started yelling covered mouth—she said germs would get inside coat zipper (and coughing hand elbow would better coverage?). 

But one time wore one, got many weird looks, since wearing people’s comfort didn’t seem working, stopped. 

I’m glad masks going normalized Human human spreading handful cases live animal market obvious. 

Hell there's new swine flu right China actually seem spread humans, farm workers caught it. clearly understand Constitution. virus become easily spread solely less deadly (more hosts survive transmit)? something else rna structure mutate something transmissible Way cases us way people social distancing. Death effects all.... studies? way wearing mask could harm you. matter works not. Either wear mask works (Yay) wear mask doesn’t work. wearing mask nothing may well least try something. 

This thinking line Pascal’s wager believe. Shut baby dick! skeptical time. assumed wanted make sure people NEEDED masks could get them: sick people healthcare professionals. Since time changed since PPE shortages ended, believe right. vaccine trial fails? could say sure ""The vaccine early 2021"", sure delay. vaccine around 2023? can't remote teach till without major issues. mask gymnastics people doing. wear mine mask science hasn’t gone anywhere, idea effective are. It’s legally enforced based maybe. bothers me. Yes, send anonymous report. gave much information would dangerous quarantine. work jobs interacting public. able get Schengen Visa's now? I'm international student studying UK. understand they're giving VISA's many nations perhaps since residents permit I? open schools? working parents kids? going feed kids rely school lunches? It’s seriously awful situation don’t good answer for. know exactly credit score is. never debt life, neither people know. come poor family, 2 masters degrees (as average student, high flyer), live nice downtown apartment garden, hundred meters away lives mayor, although income quite average, every year travel 5 weeks (statutory holiday entitlement, holiday second monthly salary paid (statutory), everybody afford nice holiday). Every time hear stories USA happy live European welfare state. gladly accept higher taxes lower incomes compared USA. get rich here, least never worry money. leak yet published study, yet peer reviewed.

I saying wrong, way go scientifically relevant data pandemic. think use AC north? incredibly hot New Jersey weeks everyone's home business running AC. No. reading comment there. Florida testing enough overall. particular day we've tested ever tested - comment along lines percent positive keeps going increase testing 11k number much larger. I'm long island concur, mostly compliance here, tiny part country majority country getting crushed cases right now. care others northeast, rest country making difficult proud american. said that, I'm nervous getting comfortable Long island. yesterday tell parents go another restaurant seeing us (son pregnant daughter law) while. like near 100% goes with: age, BMI, underlying conditions, hospital capacity availability, luck, etc. 

Can go low almost 0% worst case e.g. 80 year old cardiac problems, asthma, able get hospital care due hospitals overloaded. piece metal making excuse. People countries, successful reducing rate infection US, make excuses. comply guidelines. Yes. 

Just transmit without droplets, mean transmits without droplets. 

The masks help stopping virus attached droplets. 

So without breath air, breath filtered out. Lowering chances contracting do, that’s took time comment. Say another sub points opposite (This nowhere Bible) found infuriating reading information provided researchers China, S. Korea later Italy virus (publicly, probably much earlier) hitting North America.

If place low value life high value ending epidemic soon possible makes perfect sense call airborne. Like testing, PPE ""masks work"".

If assume Trump administration perverted SIR model, stealthily maximizing time herd immunity instead maximizing life makes perfect sense.

I fully believe C19 response sabotaged within US Trump camp. Fauci Brix distractions infect us without knowledge.

The delay testing, lack PPE, active downplaying ""mask work"" measures increase speed epidemic keeping public facade lead Fauci. Yes able tell gotten unfortunately think get one yet Alberta. *angry Yankee fan noises* 

Hell *angry 29 mlb fanbase noises* Poor people make money rich people. Rich people care money care human lives.
Not able satiate greed hurts LOT. Evidence open movement goes America despite evidence monumentally bad idea. Shame tRump. reguard anyone/ anything. Many new angels watching left behind, gone time. Heartfelt Condolences. may perfect remember: close counts horseshoes. believe point guards able infect anyone (except prisoners guards) leave camps. Strike safety sure glad live country government can't ""control"" people. get credit realizing blindingly obvious already endangered others. Click baits worth time Taking hole new meaning Obviously. pretty pathetic. small anti-lockdown protests, associated right-wing, everyone claimed they're murderers, basically. Everyone claimed CAN'T protest spreading virus.

Then, whole attitude evaporated side started mass protests.

How see it? don’t either. people called liar threatened simply stating this, super weird response, one time : 

WE DON’T NECESSARY PPE. wanted express can't wear mask never went full Karen instead cocooned sewed found another way, every self entitled moron went full blood blood god poor retail employees. Correct, paper mask would enough guarantee absolute prevention transmission. would marked improvement nothing. Great analogy! Let expand it... ""Wear home made cloth mask"" like ""wear home made bought Amazon seatbelt"".

Sure, home made hand-woven hemp-based seatbelt might feel like works? mean, strap buckles? feels secure?

But first time get serious accident, realize there's reason masks, mean umm, seatbelts, made highly specialized materials, tested labs rigorous mathematical modeling, continually sampled production ensure quality.

So yes, mask much like seatbelt. Excellent analogy. problem credibility. Gates bought platforms grant authority opinions, regardless agenda. Pointing leads ridicule, unfortunately. it’s relevant affects public health response. least I’m area that’s throwing resources track, trace quarantine contain virus.

Aerosolised droplets vs airborne: explains people greater two rows plane caught virus even long haul flights - greatly influences considered close contact sake tracing quarantine turns something unmanageable manageable. 
E.g. Asymptomatic VS presymptomatic: Wuhan tested symptomatic people still brought intense epidemic control fast. don’t **need** test everyone. 

It doesn’t much matter UK/US type scenario core public health response enforced. world - especially resources limited choices made - distinctions save lives. child poverty. Places like Australia pretty much eliminated COVID enforcing social distancing hand washing.

I’m arguing masks - fuck, America situation wearing masks. saying that, mask isn’t be-all end-all. Hand washing still INCREDIBLY important. distance - don’t come contact people, ie literal lockdown quarantine - dont need mask either obvious reasons. dust settled 20 percent NYC antibodies. That's 2 million people. also include people asymptomatic antibodies faded quickly. appears person Australia broke required isolation visitors. unless rather strange circumstances here, knew would responsible “quarantine” hotel bill. Exactly. taking notes do. Yay! It’s actually quite fun rewarding! haven’t produced yet they’re getting ready to! &lt;The scientists say think virus linger air long periods float several metres, infecting anyone ""airborne"" like dust pollen circulating HVAC systems floating asymptomatic carrier 10 feet, 3 meters, so. Maybe me, pretty sure something New England area (NYC included) witnessing refer trucks full body bags. indeed selfish individualism makes people think distance NYC means cannot happen here. silly. I'm glad experience different. sure, putting bright blacklights elevator would surely help considering uv light kills virus. agree. hospitals still using airborne precautions patients. 

Anyone doubting amount PPE required thinking COVID hoax allowed tour units...without PPE. would 10 years hopefully covid long over. 

Anyway, used live Brazil, nearly fluent Brazilian Portuguese &amp; many friends &amp; colleagues there. Also teach occasionally U São Paulo &amp; research projects there. it’s random choice. Brazil lot issues actually, absolutely love living there. love they’re using images look like zombie movie covers time talk covid public still doesn’t see propagandizing movement all. not? 
  
 Dude Northern cities need AC starting May. East coast Midwest temps hitting 90. false argument. Right‽ Everyone talking mortality care morbidity rate. Dead dead. Dead horrible, it’s done. need focus preventing deaths supporting survivors.

How many people recovered COVID die causes next 5 years body weakened damaged?

How many “asymptomatic” cases end asthma next year?

What people running fever 3 months out?

What happen kids “fine”? going see even Kawasaki syndrome 6 months out? asthma? Allergies? Autoimmune diseases?

How many people develop epilepsy MS neurological issues COVID? two completely separate disease processes see could happen.

What scares wondering flu going interface “asymptomatic” never fully recovered.  People don’t understand longterm consequences. 

Nationwide shutdown. 40% businesses return. Continued shutdowns cause businesses fail. layoffs. City tax revenues plunging rely $$. 

Look long food lines, long lines unemployment, layoffs. happens unemployed hits 60%... 80%?  job won’t safe. Expect kids teacher ratio. 

Healthcare workers working pandemic. saying.... much people taking seriously? 

How much 6' enough indoors?

And taking seriously longer willing go public spend taxable dollars. government terrified second one best interest health &amp; family. took “gap year” delayed student teaching one year, would incredibly easy “explain away.” You’ve got entire lifetime work career, one year drop bucket. mostly doomers chant ""just wait two weeks!"" apocalyptic fantasies repeatedly fail materialize. therein lies dangers politicizing pandemic. happens politicans, medical scientific professionals, authority inform public make informed executive decisions behalf health safety. 

What needed swift sharing resources, information tools among countries medical professionals place fact based education research. 

Instead got vehement campaign muzzle voices individuals qualified speak public this, discredit them, allow politicians manifest another wave pandemic. Rich people also money positions continue working least making money safe environments economy opens up. dont need go factories, retail stores, distribution centers, etc. Even sports complexes, private box many guests like. Rich elites want open economy marginally increases risk them. rich arent people ttying open economy. 

Really, think problem short sightedness, lack government leadership (which elected people), misinformation conservative media. Private property, right eject call police it. ""we"" though? us knew least suspected it. point article regulatory bodies like CDC downplaying aerosol transmission, probably part reason fucked messaging masks too. would OK wearing facemask school? couldn’t spread girlfriend sleeps bed me, GIVES? Keep mind ftbagency risen dead needs put again. WHOIS information posted July 4 daily thread lead hosting provider domain abuse contacts. Abuse alcohol near national past time England shit started, imagine damage now.  Ah, PSCO well? Yeah, we're fucked. 5yo starts kindergarten local Greek-sounding 'Academy'... I'm freaking fuck out. Also throwing Norway conservative government 7 years now. like 'radical left' supporting universal healthcare. mention they're ones making situation longer needs be. length time one contagious 10-14 days. everyone started wears masks today we'd probably shit like 6 weeks so. 90 percent people thought protests 0 effect spreading virus, good Disney reopening. higher % fresh air vs. recirculated air, better. could change school's HVAC systems accomplish reasonable cost, need to. problem cost, initial capital investment huge increase (about 6 times) energy cost winter. actually live Sarasota county school district. much sucks say, parents hard time going back work kid home. School relieves without pay ass child care.

We second child thankfully people watch second kid. school age kid remote year. worried kid get spread grandparents etc. I’m worried wife, grand parents/great grand parents would hospital stay death probably. Well also one educated word. fact according wikipedia link South Korea educated young people younger people use internet older.

 people sad Cap wears mask, too. posted articles supporting airborne February half replies strongly disputed it. think airborne confirmed February would even debate mask wearing ? No, concrete evidences.

Until read actual published piece, hold judgment. France tried it, go CIDRAP University Minnesota currently working this. studying efficacy masks measures likely prevent spread.  said first message, I'm obviously advocating states like Florida open schools right now. saying **in states epidemic control**, opening school feasible thing IMO, beneficial children. People think wait everyone vaccinated open schools done numbers stable, obviously case many states. Everyone purchased PPE mostly countries purchased raw materials suppliers.

They've increasing capacity global demand rising we're pandemic.

Now compete medical facilities, compete businesses needing PPE.

I'm US US says they're producing seen must hospital. People give weird looks wearing respirator. worry looking cool I'm vent hospital. trying judge poster sounds like general attitude folks want wear mask looks
 
 someone chimes says exhaust port expels droplets say modified mine diy filter exhaust port prevent droplets spreading interior exterior. La thank brandan schaub role Canada 3 times population Florida. one day 2k cases correction bunch files updated once. Otherwise peak 2k. family visit us outdoors work somewhere taking good precautions. People around pretty good masks things starting reopen. Toronto, dense city 3 million, 20 cases yesterday. whole country 226 cases yesterday. Number like Florida would horrifying. Either schools failed teaching parts respiratory system, people wear masks way C students bare minimum comply work. Yes, I'm calling stupid. fair, much ""going herd immunity"" much ""not giving fuck many people die reopen economy pump stock market up."" conditions ALONE create almost perfect-storm type setting virus spread (obviously, non-science-background opinion). Combine many hands-off absent parents, students faculty ignore rules get day, try first/ask questions later mentality higher-ups

That’s really it. Sure studies (but all) say kids n% resistant getting virus.  put poorly ventilated close-quarters hyper-concentrated virus reactor 30 hours week, that’s going matter much. Theyre going spread like wildfire. Please world favor Covid patient cough face, immediately go quarantine. beginning social distancing (the 6 feet rule) pushed last resort, choice (eg: grocery store). things moved forward, taken ""safe"" distance, we're 6 feet apart whatever want. Nothing new info. AFAIK ""new"" info protests, protests high degree social distancing outdoor people wearing masks fairly low (but non-zero) infection rates old news. Today's cases VIC 74. Yes no. 

I pretty sure reason CDC dragging feet making public statements Covid airborne American people going conniption fit word. known least particles airborne hiding behind ""no evidence"" clause cat bag. mention middle weekend Americans. like companies worried public's reaction. guy’s dumb come. He’s always continues dumb jock douche. Well, it’s holiday weekend states/media would still like go spend money. tomorrow new restrictions put place need tax revenue. Unfortunately, stupid U.S. won’t make difference. subreddit made scared leave home even get groceries live country testing per million population... friends whacked sense me, like stop hermit wear mask, sanitize hands avoid crowds everything turn ok. I've known airbone myself! I’m sorry. starting improve? Part age positives lower. yes, it’s wifey reported recovery rates much better back in, say, March.  open space individual offices. offices clustered two three share thermostat air handler, return 1 office. large areas single large air handler one thermostat. see fan cycle streamers put vent. basically look like large-size home unite well (one sits right outside office). air contaminant particulate measurements taken monthly due working semi-industrial environment. I’m sure code is, I’ve worked several buildings A/C radiant heating actually code air circulation? 50k cases day US still canceled sports fall. Unbelievable. I've actually noticed people complimenting eyes often used to. Apparently they're attractive without rest face. Damn title looks straight Onion lol think people tend forget deaths long game immediate. also forget long lasting effects recovered. going drain health care system years decades come. think second virus going cause long term lifetime damages survive Doubt Shut nerd sounds like rationalization unwilling put work Asian countries did. matter? Corona running wild usa guys scared called racist cant even call protesters account reckless abandonment social distancing. point context matter. 4th July celebration good idea. obvious double standard. Typical yank. 

‘I don’t care country laws, want want I’m going get IM AMERICAN’ Left home go grocery store. That’s variable. 130k number US alone, yes value likely low 30k Use search bar, ya know? know pneumonia kills, micro clots lungs, need prevented early. know ventilators kill used excessively, oxygen important. know steroids anti viral drugs (remdesivir example) help. know auto immune system shock kill, try treat that. Also mostly younger population shows sick, higher chance survival. liar. high probability happening except giving someone else. Thanks Hilary Duff (in sarcastic Dane Cook voice) get infected wind blowing house? Great even staying home 100% safe wondering same. Well, tomorrow... Also, hard socially distance must start fight end evening. 

Drunk people generally respectful regulations, probably ask drive. almost many peak NJ. granted Texas larger population, localized, nightmare, keeps growing.. ... good ICU, 1:1 1:2 ratio nurse patient. Sounds like working Level 1 trauma centers.

On hand, attendings 30 patients floor. 99.99% sure China said airborne via xinqua? global times ""news""

Can't remember state media source google I'm sure pop up. torture. That's melodramatic. Florida Keys thing. Lock barely cases. #1 cases, allow anyone come in. Exactly opposite going on. talking yesterday. One idea non-working parents 4-5 kids virtual learning thier house. lot of.work, much safer overall. I’m teacher U.S. 


For bonus points, live Florida.


My wife also teacher mother also works within high school.


We like super fucked. course context matters. can’t see that, spend time arguing. protesting something feel passionately about, imagine would feel differently. ""the biggest outbreaks linked several bars area"" 😬 odds infection based whether neighbor thinks lizard illuminati aliens.

It's Congress' job ensure public health policy keep people safe regulation. Read more. Take automatic Simpsons-related upvote! wife teacher FL. Everyone knows part opposed going back in. know protected cared about. lot thinking retiring quitting, taking sick time early protest cause havoc. know they're thrown wolves essentially continue narrative Governor ""we're good!"".

Wonder many lawsuits start getting sick. think it’s far better say, “we still trying understand fully transmits. yet rule airborne transmission contact transmission.”  Etc forget Kushner playing pirate stealing shipments masks. 
“At end day,” said, “a lot going depend young people showing discretion good sense.” 🤔 shit Aerosol droplet. Airborne extends past droplet phase virus essentially hangs air depleting micro droplets time.

Additionally, infections intubations, bronchoscopies, etc. dental offices anything? US closed this. collect respiratory droplets use

no, still stop droplets. answered question. unsubbed. place nothing echo chamber fear mongering.

I see posts sub hit r/all look thread 99% time ignore top comments it’s utter bullshit. 

The moderation sub pretty much nonexistent Dong meet .onion hospital least says receiving aerosolized treatments wear N95. not, wear surgical mask hope best. 

 Slightly different but: Nowadays required wear googles masks day, everyday. Lockdown magically make virus disappear, merely delays deaths hospitalizations prevent overflow. think mask wearing issue goes deep psyche. use Moral Foundation Theory ( political psychology theory) analyze mask wearing youtube video.  There's little evidence outbreaks caused protests. Nearly tracing done shows outbreaks due mostly parties public social activities. Can't imagine much would suck adults acting like 16 year olds too.

Very generous compare low-life wastes organic matter 16-year-olds.  somehow still get dumbfucks openly supporting efforts - absolutely unreal! Accountability needs held lies. utterly ironic COVID-19 denier Schaub camera catching show, difficult time speaking cleared throat multiple definitely havnt watched Contagion 8 times already forget Kushner playing pirate stealing shipments masks. Deplorable Patriots love harassing bullying people; feel better themselves.

Fucking losers, like pathetic leader.  Great post. Agree 100%. Treatment awareness much better place 3 months ago. Still solve problem patients able get treated due capacity. hospitals hitting surge turning away milder cases keep room bad ones. That's beginning losing little control milder cases progress. Patients may return late.  It’s suggested since February, insisted spread droplets airborne.

I’ve commented airborne subreddit several times always got heavily downvoted 🤷‍♀️ They’re N95 hard find places sell them. [this place sells 

Surgical masks thin layer don’t seal well around side face they’re effective self protection. protect others though. heard surgical ones filter 30-80% depending manufacturers. forget Kushner playing pirate stealing shipments masks. Wow. keeping up, then.

Something like 40% ""recovered"" cases symptoms, severe, months later. Never said didn’t wear one, said getting arrested wearing one one knows effectiveness wrong. Step 1: Put hands gloves.
What missing? Cases rose everywhere there’s wasn’t already first wave. 

Also love mental gymnastics. Gathering groups thousands isn’t risk spreading highly contagious disease. That's starter rate. It'll higher states run hospital beds. masks help anxiety bit, social distancing. mask feels like armor crazy brain really helps people supposed stay apart keep interactions brief. ever government official seriously believed drunk people would responsibly socially distance resign. inept public service. happened me, non native English speaker (not much speaker though). similarities 2 words, ""Netherlands"" easiest choice brain, apparently. sue idiotic administration. know likely part mentality, ffs lives needlessly put risk due negligent behaviour leadershit Exactly, semantics game. 

The bottom line is: people spread virus even yet experience symptoms. cannot stay home feeling sick. Absolutely, I'd love visit friends pub, I'll wait another month see happens. pics shown absolutely insane.   Yep 1 10 per 100,000 accurate, neither 47 million infections, number closer 110 million, 47 million cases. average number deaths US last ten flu seasons closer 37,000. would put IFR 37,000/110,000,000, 0.036% (36 per 100,000) IFR SARS-COV-2 US roughly 130,000/20,000,000, 0.65% NBA happen taking extreme measures protect players. leagues done nothing seasons canceled.  looking at? China didn’t really covid outbreak, lot SE Asia hasn’t sufficiently studied either. Taiwan also benefit island aggressive TTI protocol place. Politicized willful ignorance conclude arrogance attitude wrong practically everything? Yes, mouth protection good idea. No, China initially tell virus. Yes, coronavirus global threat. Yes, H2H transmission (which knew 14 Jan). constantly wrong everything, annoying fock, even exist can't get right once?

Necessary disclaimer: I'm trump fan, reasons dislike besides deflecting incompetence, like pointing incompetence. believe also means masks people wear (e.g. surgical masks) protect yourself, need people wearing protects people. Yea gist nytimes article last night. Basically, researchers frustrated considering something airborne it’s like Measles. still something mildly airborne it’s world difference large droplet transmission. Fair enough. Million Unmasked March*

*number attendees 998,000 fewer advertised. general rule what's droplets also airborne airborne droplets (simply smaller droplets). We've known decades. reason we're argument last 6 months. guess we're stupid. They're literally little girls. would probably look say ""yes sir"" someone yelled No, pubs need brought line told take responsibility, closed down. Can't shut every thing down. Folk need jobs, businesses need trade. happy medium. fact is, everyone survive fresh air much media painting rosy picture money all. lot people basically surviving scavenged food brink made homeless.

So yeah, things stand, businesses favors cash grabbing much short term. Many realise better lesser, steady flow cash nothing city locked again. people know saying things like wear masks, Covid exist, etc, people weird opinions even without social media involved.

I highly doubt people form opinions solely read something someone else said social media. they're easily influenced, they're probably sound mind anyway. Nah, support social distancing measures myself...it's suspicion history written we'll find largest outbreaks occurred driven biology behavior.

Behavior influences get hit, do. going happen like NY, everywhere else? Assuming reason NY CT well virus burned two states? ie. killed people die it, others recovered go? Looks like took NY 1 month go 10k cases daily cases dropping drastically.. expect CA, FL TX? Spend bulli9ns wall keep kids cages! someone explain going packed beach risky even though outside there's constant breeze ocean? I'm supporting idea I'm asking I've hearing virus MAINLY spreads indoors outdoors. That's saying too, actually weeks near-zero cases. certainly acting like second wave, escalation You’re one drinking cook aid don’t think protest anything spike cases. Literally thousands people street, crowded together shouting. Doesn’t matter much testing do, returning campus go well. college students going stop parties wear masks time? social distancing? turn like opening bars did. per yearly tradition states many students per class now? Plenty places world high mask compliance, also tons Coronavirus infections.

This likely correlation imply causation kinda scenario. realize illegal child unsupervised age 12. Children disabilities like autism still keeps illegal even 12. get argument let's confuse parents facing cops child protection services. sure? think it’s well Little hope *average* person. However, think average. probably well. average, I'm sure. think I'm average definitely 'superior' know flaws gaps need learn others bolsters belief self-assessment. told *why* masks found ineffective (operator error) let us make decisions information. 

There's also extra diligence comes mask-wearing unusual you. wear mask, part continually thinks unusual touch it. expect medical students would likely treat wearing *normal* given extra diligence. Also, medical students *medical* students mean still immature arrogant. New York 700+ cases yesterday still keeping open. New York seems great. 

Could countries like Spain China overreacting? mean, would quarantine couple **hundred thousand** people hundred cases? mean non-N95 masks useless then? air breath going slip them. buddy said Sales meeting last month boss REQUIRED meet client person. chose sit opposite side room somewhat careful, client showed meeting wearing mask, friend’s boss said, “if want keep business us, you’ll remove mask.” Wow, almost like insurance scam! Second Amendment right shoot come near without mask? country rushes vaccine take either. relax get reddit banned country Thank asking. yet, hope.  I'm teacher TX. I'm taking break year. pisses working healthcare. know airborne - going CDC recommendations, changed once. 
 
No raises year (probably next year either). places 401k match taken away. hazard pay. list goes on. mask help. look taiwan real talk need mask walk dog? live suburbs almost never come within ten feet another person, that’s maybe times per week Perhaps need set security cameras stream Internet. Well, possible touched contaminated surface elevator? Since say actually rode it. flip side find damn thing airborne not. Generally speaking, natural selection causes contagions evolve become contagious less deadly time, since killing host makes less able spread infection. mean impossible deadlier version mutate though. BECAUSE.

THIS. Yes, definite apprehension. I'm weary, definitely feel comfortable concept yet quite frank. understand isolating frustrating limited movement, I'd rather cautious safe take unnecessary risks end back square one. determined children play minor role spread disease reopening schools lead widespread surges? Depending spread virus countries balance public health risks children receiving education. Double layer cloth masks nonwoven masks definitely useful, people need quit treating masks perfect barrier. I've seen sooooo many people NC completely ignoring distancing rules mask on. never understand casually reckless people scenario swab go deeply nose, throat, *that* bad. excellent opportunity, then, say nothing. Bigly aerosol droplets, airborne Gathering crowds thousands isn’t risk factor?


The reopening actually going well protests started. protests 100% blame. area actually contained first wave getting bulldozed right now. Airbone... would opt that. Online classes dime dozen. actual college experience irreplaceable, especially able get elite school. Nope, selfishness pretty rampant country. Theres televised reported evidence contrary saying part students school wear masks?  Ill never understand since I'm idiot, what's even point? get it, youre dumbass think covid hoax people wearing masks pussies mind. mean need slinging around shitty ass negative energy fucking butthurt. Stupid assholes need keep themselves. Thinking safety others Japanese.

It's something Americans lacking terribly consideration community. por que los dos? people hear ""asymptomatic people can't spread it"" go back without hearing ""presymptomatic"" part. One hard parts disseminating scientific information large population. Especially with, uh, less ideal leadership. effectively fight vitus knowledge?

Seems like opposite ""We're fucked."" latest wave infections caused proportional rise deaths, cdc estimated .2-1% IFR. 

Current COVID percentage mortality doesn’t even meet CDC’s threshold epidemics. Well thing America many people confuse ""freedom"" obligation belligerent contrarian asshole. HMO plan focus heavily health wellness stay hospital. got appendicitis January, surgery, drain put 2 days antibiotic treatment, $28,000 total bill. I’ll paying pocket max ($6,500) October. good engineering job middle road insurance plan. could sworn Americans inconsiderate assholes study link to? It’s straight article, broke down. Yeah fair enough, I’ll edit it. figured “contracted covid” would interpreted testing positive almost became teacher changed degree ASSC. I'm glad did. I'd quit could safe. I've already first hand witnessed (through nephews niece half brother/sisters) kids bring sickness home effect much. I'd petrified kinda pissed became teacher right TBH. Distance learning disadvantages, also advantages. think able balance home learning school (for specific subjects, chemistry example) teaching. went college 65% home 25% class anxiety issues. failed chemistry twice online person class passed easily. Chemistry hard reading instructions learning time *what* doing. focus heavily health wellness stay hospital. got appendicitis January, surgery, drain put 2 days antibiotic treatment, $28,000 total bill. I’ll paying pocket max ($6,500) October. good engineering job middle road insurance plan. im confused airborne? someone explain it? know starving women don’t ovulate, right?

And takes calories gestate fetus would gain consuming one. 

Also, really need get fucking help. won’t eat restaurants long time. USA that's listening evidence, entire continent. make sound like shit together Canada I've hearing term aerosolized since early on. think Asymptomatic/presymptomatic electric Boogaloo.

We knew along treating way. theatres open yet, even low capacity restaurants dangerous.

The real deal need stress even though know spread microdroplets masks still effective. far tell, studies used justify school openings flaw: they’re based testing data. 

Logically, children tested much lower rate. seems safe say virus affects less seriously, general. So, asymptomatic. unless we’re massive, blanket testing, we’re going miss ton child cases. 

Most parents aren’t children swabbed they’re asymptomatic.

So point low incidence child cases without acknowledging low testing rate children super problematic IMHO. seems generally accepted point spread asymptomatically... 

Second, places re-opened areas gotten virus widely control.

I’m parent, I’m concerned kids’ emotional social development. think push reopen schools — especially among epidemiologists— based personal desires logic. Yeah credibility even newspaper book. pretty good idea stuff airborne cruse ship sitting Japan people kept getting sick. Oh yeah! S/  said it’s couple days ago - would magically disappear - it’s insane - day 1st day 50 k cases one day - might even say operating like one vaunted ""s***hole"" countries. Thanks, .ca list may work. 

I know Triclosan used many Canada approved products banned US. FDA bans many ingredients countries approved, getting tedious figure list is, boundary truth lies. someone going way make McDonald's worker's job worse; piece shit. UV kills virus blacklight (\~380nm) UV-C (\~240nm) good eyes. UV sterilization makes mroe sense insider ducts sanitize air without line sight people. Maybe. sure hidden 2.5m cases. 😆😮😟 would provide financial relief forcibly quarantined. \#ClapForTheNHS makes lot sense. post bit confusing first, maybe work ""eventually tested negative."" teachers need fight better resources pay, you’re front line getting taken advantage long. surprised unfortunately. US still battling virus full force. Yeah, again, surprised confusion hospitals county enough generators point care what's happening grid.

Our long-term care facilities...aren't robust unfortunately. needs happen. rest world doesn’t need stop living sick people might get sicker. 😂 called ""evidence based medicine"". Nothing true 100% sure is. May work enough time gather evidence, amid time-critical pandemic become roadblock prevention. example. People keep insisting ventilators, mounting evidence helping. People keep insisting administering medicines late. virus airbone, masks necessary. so. many fuck-ups Nice summary thank you! / Holy Shite! 

Will Ronny back down? Evidence countries opened schools (here Belgium fully open ages 3-6) shows young children play (big) role spread disease. no, fucked. understanding one fundamental civil liberties US right health – right stay alive

Actually right exists likely. UN treaty would clearly provided rights, US sign. Well gee, given hordes people ignoring/defying kind safer practices, maybe need triggering. barely testing. barely test, barely cases. barely cases, hardly deaths based cases. began fixate individual liberties without understanding one **most fundamental civil liberties US right health**

Hahaha term “airborne” suggests virus passed floating infectious. case.

The article saying case say unequivocally recently, never thought ""other side"" populated morons. may agreed them, may attributed ill intent policies beliefs came side, never thought sheer stupidity.

I clear side I'm thinking times separated me. Meaning, judgments different depending talking politician side, think generally intelligently masterfully manipulating public opinion sentiment. next level people support side solely benefits bank account, final level people support side even though side really benefiting meaningful way, better job opportunities, better educational opportunities, etc. I'm basically, last group, talking people vote self interest.

I can't help attribute moronicness people essentially look statement says 1 + 1 = 2 argue that's fact true, truth somehow colored bias. person original poster DM conversation comes mind. difficult person understand % increase positive case numbers sounding alarm? truly 1 + 1 = 2 kind thing.

Right wrong, I've written people off. deemed unreachable therefore unnecessary try persuade them. I'm looking folks second group know better, believe 1 + 1 = 2, try influence them. may right approach, approach I'm taking sanity.

I definitely check book. looked briefly, looks interesting. Thank reference. Crazy well known tested U.S. like countries  knows know? expert cite layman opinion? Every health expert world right agrees: Wear fucking mask. CDC

We know CDC... right now? really making me, student, sad point. advocating schools reopen want educate kids much want public daycare. Schools opening 50% capacity county masks required bus( dramatic surge cases) we're even one heavily anti-mask counties.

Lastly, *really* care schools, show diverting funding lot lesser-off one instead reopening unsafe manner? good summary. referring scientific community straight lied people, yea classy. Ummm... there's lot scientific data around world. Media fairly quiet scientists quite concerned. close friend called CV overblown 2 months. got bragged beat 4 days. month chronic dizzy spells later got lung xray revealed ground-glass opacity plain day. hospital, pneumonia, long duration illness, lungs f'd treatment options prognosis nobody knows heals yet. went ""overblown"" ""you guys stay F away thing"". Nobody immune similar outcome. TN chirping in— district gave parents option send students back school. (I feeling create huge divide haves/have nots.) Apparently, though, teachers campus classrooms virtual learners “Skyped” observe lesson/classroom. 🤷‍♀️ frequently cuts hands, use gloves.
But also know take properly wash hands I'm done regardless.
Most 'techniques' PPE simple, feel could learned anyone, we're seeing much stupidity pandemic faith people wavering. ducked putting bubble Florida. Teachers could use opportunity fight fair pay resources. believe would seen valid. would rephrase say virus “burned out” among people didn’t voluntarily involuntarily (i.e. Essential workers) social distance NY, CT, NJ. There’s still portion people proactively followed social distancing guidelines within populations.

The hospitals states recent surges covid cases and/or overwhelmed. 

IMO, it’s matter time could cause second wave Northeast. (Note: consider first wave TX/FL etc). There’s regulation state borders, I’ve heard handful people saying planning go states “for weekend” :/ Coughing symptom, asymptomatic people spread virus, therefore airborne. need educate coronavirus would go away April. 
/s Indeed Also teacher. Upped life insurance week, that's much expect get Covid. ... stop spread virus. Test, isolate, trace. Could supply appropriate citations?

I find 7NEWS article credible. immediately wonder Atmospheric Scientist 100% sure infectious disease export epidemiologist would 100% sure of. poor don’t pay hospital bills here. you’re super low income, entire bill get waived. Google big hospital financial assistance usually there’s protocol prove income everything gets let go. It’s part reason bills high everyone else even close full picture. obesity rates groups mentioned article compare? I’m speechless. I’m sorry you’re position. I’m healthcare provider &amp; despite see 2 eyes every day, people think know better proceed “normal life” there’s safe vaccine. really cannot say enough sorry you’re taken advantage like this...health vs income. hope someone intervened actually go plan. safe &amp; well, friend. word ""Startegy"" implies someone planned benefits it. benefit ""they""?  Definitely consult Doctor quarantine. want spread more, considerate. Even NBA players don’t want go back that’s social bubble finish season/playoffs. “hurt” rehabbing hurting free agency prospects. going get anyone back NBA players won’t go back safest environment create right now?? need training. bright, special whatnot, believe math science. people mild symptoms infect others general know gonna bad. used work FL government. giant circle passing buck. Gov. passes County, County points State, State points Feds. County points Principals, Principals point teachers. end, people going make difference spreads teachers tell kids practice safety, affect happens class. Bus rides, bus stops, after-school care, etc., risks too. practice safety want 'classroom' kids together day 'school' even get infected classroom, there's plenty exposure spread around. Germany, Everybody currently going school. half class goes time. need wear masks hallway. recess, we‘re outside, class we‘re seated 2 meters away other. Normality restored next school year. feel bad college students right now. inevitably turn online learning idea paying $50k makes stomach turn maybe thousands people screaming walking street. recall correctly first Princeton University study. personally struggle reading scientific studies, try. Unfortunately it’s simply late US back science based approach. top down, succeeded politicizing virus main driver US worst response world imo. 🤷🏾‍♂️ read anecdotal evidence doctors fine surgical masks only.

Yeah, people fine driving home 100mph, rain, without seatbelt, one two beers. heard new soap opera coming soon TV near you? 

""The young maskless"" Archive link http://archive.is/tHYGU amount volume air much higher way lower chance stairwell. elevator small closed environment breathing fill smaller volume higher concentration Covid viral load. Also easier touch anything stairway. key opened doors never touch anything. said according picture room social distancing. like place crowded said, strains East West.

Yeah, seems take time (and opportunity) new strain take hold.

Both strains across U.S. well - Northeast got severely hit 2-3 months ago way Southern Western states getting hit now. 

Anecdotal, seems got hit less virulent strain originated East Asia first takes time strain propagate take hold see exponential growth. Yeah, not, CDC government fail, lets blame Chinese scientists. Yeah, that's sure. pry N95 mask cold, dead hands. Yeah don't. 

The best reduce infections them. surgical masks designed contain airborne virus either. would love see controlled tests much Covid type stop. guess people would surprised good way Death rates par 5% worldwide. people using masks California neither Florida. Again... *sigh*, masks never stopping virus. It’s slowing spread rate hospitals stay open economy open back up. fuck’s sake Well, Texas residents going México get treatment, point Tamaulipas governor asking Mexican federal government stop Thank sacrifice Americans. Unfortunately, giving lot us much credit. 

There awful lot Canadians watching what's going thinking ""They make good point. need protect constitutional rights too!! Listen Sheeple, lockdown!"" 

No amount reminding constitution, never experienced anything even remotely resembling lockdown, United States actual fucking dumpster fire getting ready implode (or explode take us them) convince anything. China know COVID since early 2019 even knew outbreak potential. don’t trust China nither rest world. Even citizens know government bad. original mask lies.

The stated purpose ""you need mask"" ""doctors healthcare workers need first enough.""

It take much reading lines figure one out. knew time. crazy one talking this. Looks like deliberate attempt avoid mass panic. go... mom teacher CA retired. see keep safe dealing 30ish little disease vectors. teachers union really needs step fight folks. also took extreme measures, like using police enforce stay home measures. ""Cover contagion holes, friend."" It’s basis hundreds cases, thousands, use force defend ones life. It’s largely fault governor, Ron Desantis. Bad messaging, hands approach, rushed reopening, data manipulation, name it. 

Second place prize goes citizens themselves. know viruses don’t cause pandemics - people do. Everyone seems think it’s ok dine indoors without masks despite clear science contrary. Among many shenanigans. 100 per cent sure this

Fret not, Trump miraculously find controversy position wrong side. no. got back run turned computer shocked see comment. would replied earlier life computer waiting people respond. 45,000 new cases US yesterday (4th) lot cities report numbers. wonder real number would look like. mega corporations ones originally started requiring mask beginning. mask order public, one employees. yes want reopen quick possible, never passed along anti mask propaganda. done far right Trump. did, information virus along news outlets weeks behind. world power believes opening ok face masks farce. tilt thw screen, flat! read comment clicking article, thought calling US Gilead Handmaid’s Tale flat wrong, fun internet points. Uruguay done great job think change opens up? You’re saying significant amount people don’t show symptoms till 14 days? think lot stress, 12+ hour workdays, time/energy cook healthy meals vs grabbing fast food way home something vending machine. Shut yo baby ass dick self year's new song camp, Kovid Kumbaya rich people. Regular workers concerned shutting economy able provide families. 80 bus drivers New York here's lousy stimuli check 1200$ bother anymore. Yeah... except teachers general bunch housewives right crying miss students.

Not trying mean... literally get fucked EVERY DAMN TIME. Someone needs fill water balloons Covid concoction. Hmmm, next narcissistic Trump rally? can't believe one assassinated traitor country. ready toss away people. Republicans need nut fucktard. need psychological help. I'm legit driven mad. dad works transport hub, luckily interact many people


I can't get stop coughing openly loudly house. Everytime ask cover, either gets angry shouts claiming ""this house able cough!"" fake coughs make fun me.


Im really paranoid could get huge viral load thanks practices. Worst part is, I'm even allowed use thermometer, can't even know fever, I've heard one main sunptoms corona parent sk student next September. May odds ever favour.

Seriously though we're trying get used protocols around keeping hands clean. touch certain things. clean after. He'll five lot we're going try best.

Still debating pulling SK optional year he's need social exposure due speech issues we're torn sending him. do.. we're hoping give teacher good student situation. Yeah think is. headline alarming sensational contents. That’s textbook click bait. Honestly real problem. poor enough Medicaid birth costs $0 (my sister two kids Medicaid probably way could afforded children). two children total hospital bills $25k $39k insurance (around $9k total after). Love kids death, put real dent family's ability put away money rainy day. clear, people using original guidance undermine government score cheap political points. Although take long pivot guidance masks became widely available many countries. live tourist town. traffic heaviest ever been. unbelievable meeting people, US come tiny community bring entire family... grandma/grandpa everyone inbetween. saw family roll TEN DEEP know personally covid hotspot state (by far! approaching number countries!)... think nothing coming down, going out, partying busy places coming back town spreading around. sickening watch. Afaik, virus comes body mucus membranes. probably accurate. would mean 6%-9% country already infected. NYC estimating 20-25% people there, balancing hard hit hard hit areas makes sense. One companies specializes lab compliance get know scientists field. One acquaintances rana study back February early March (2020 fucking blur) proved airborne, also noted dispersion rates enclosed environments. US based study one point mountain anecdotal evidence NYC back up. Instead, Florida home state Texas decided open. mind melting amount stupidity hubris Abbott Desantis shown. wife packed shit moved Teton County. nobody's surprise, virus behaved exactly predicted Florida Texas fucked.

PS: **If everyone wears mask, transmission rates decreased significantly.** mask catches exhaust filters little incoming viral load. everyone wears one, exhaust caught filtered. 100%, 80% better 0%.

I'm happy wrong. Texas government would rather thousands people die economy shut down. Even funerals generate revenue.

Exactly. exactly problem going beach, surrounded sun, sand salt water, staying 10-20 feet away everyone?

It's cooped indoors failing wear mask crowded places problem, outdoor activities. like compare glitter. Inhaling lot glitter likely yield infection. Inhaling little glitter? Maybe not.

Glitter gets EVERYWHERE. someone throws handful glitter me...even basic hospital mask going block lot it. all, quite bit....and sort mitigation better zero mitigation all.

Why hell plans sooner? look NY think fucking joke? know air systems cruise ships spread respitory illness ship. Michigan's done pretty good. made couple mistakes forgivable imo thousands people threatening murder following science. need hard lockdown month. hard, one goes outside, protests, masks hot. 4 weeks quarantine get numbers down. 
The reopening hardest part. Slowly, social distance much possible, restaurants, bars, offices 20 (that going hurt economy total shutdown). people keep avoid crazy high spikes threaten hospital capacity keep transmission rate 1ish avoid exponential growth maybe stretch thing theres teatment/cure/vaccine. Can't get airborne unless half USA already exposed? could airborne Rt values 1.1 1.4?

[Rt values](http://rt.live) hoax illinois going deaths reopening :) fish chips shop fish chip shop. help America president helping way shape form communicate correct information public. That’s calling airborne headline misleading. But* hit floor

There's even this. I've saved tons reports links doc. unreal level information made available public even referenced virus first widely reported N.A. yet do. realize China even admit Coronavirus could transmitted human human January 21 one virulogists went public own, right? Except Disney staff serving hotels quarentined.  nba going play enough games get 70 tv obligations shut down. family three also lots friends staying home away gatherings etc.. since March 1. We’ve even called names people thought friends. Stay strong feel right family. Sorry happening bet it’s going story many us share. disagree.

I work office, home, company that's made clear return office slow, based safety workers. I'm fucked.

I'm totally getting problem. don’t see death rate stay lower keeps happening we’re even locking force peak couldn’t every surface elevator well? discounting work done study honestly asking. yep -and people's minds means masks help wear Oh, agreed, vigorously going enforce it? listen Stephen Smith, believes sneaking players girls “Bubble” real problem... Yeah people need chill call year wash. Sometimes things happen lose year. 🤷‍♀️ link videos, please send them.

I Bulgaria things going well either, government refuses lock tourism. wish someone could explain thought process behind government healthcare system overinflating numbers making pandemic seem worse actually is? 

Are trying strike fear everyone control people? trying make trump look bad? What’s game plane ding falsify reality? nurse also exposes dogmatic, counter productive, set old ways much “evidence based” practice extreme resistance ideas current paradigm. Labor delivery protocols perfect examples. can, one one hand, realize PPE recommendations in-room asinine treat every positive patient airborne droplet, also realize I’m wearing mask outside studied risk transmission incredibly small. no, insane hubris think science knows everything. Look Victorian-era early 1900s medicine examples related hubris. scientific community rocky past deny denying history. Science done wonders, absolute wonders, us, seriously unholy things also happened name science. - look one USS Roosevelt
- comment one mentioned - ""That 75% undoubtedly (as authors acknowledge) includes people went develop symptoms."" - Look studies asymptomatic spread - read (or articles them) find lot follow up. know feels like daycare, there's lot that's super unfortunate hard solve.

- Yes, there's fact economy mostly centered 9-5 schedule that's partially supported children following similar schedule. feels like daycare, fact that's everybody working. 

- Distance education work everyone. kids, school VA, could distance education next year probably fine. I'm upper middle class white dude affluent area that's awash privilege. far away students broadband internet access given. kids staying home affect job, might affect parents job. kids go school, go day care. problem, different person.

- follow-on education others. whole generation kids already pronounced differences income systemic racism made 100x worse effectively saying ""these poor children adequately prepared.""

I guess I'm saying SUPER sucks. want anyone else risk lives, realistic alternatives way harm MILLIONS children? Nevermind education ramifications, parents eligible unemployment they're choosing stay home can't put food table? schools fundamental part social structure, adequate time build alternative... I'm super open ideas.

Personally, I'd like see flexible attendance policy supporting modes instruction least reduce population school.

examples think hotrods thebootleggers used build run liqour Answer: know long term (say, twenty years) effect infection. ignorant

you're* ignorant (sorry) legit question (and record, barely leave house since mid March).

From read, maintain distance outdoors chances catching virus fairly low. Especially windy environments like beach. place (or drive day) keep distance others one safest bets could make outside staying home?

I thinking terms constant ocean breeze people usually maintain 6 ft distance unless crowded. talking viral load factor here, hard get open space wind constantly blowing?

Be nice, honestly legitimate question. mean standing closed forced ventilation room windows? Nah. Wow! feel that?  least taking seriously - Bottom line one taking deadly virus lightly US government- Thank goodness, sanity. recently explained ""airborne"" meant coworker article comments making question knew. way. I'm sorry that, yes first language plus side story live Illinois I'm guessing numbers ok compared states still feel like taken precaution part though American entitlement disgusting. remember posting airborne ages ago reddit people didn’t believe. I’m glad found this! England still European country. whole UK. AC usage, prominent Korea Japan cases also soaring. Sooo good apocalyptic movie suggestions? doubt change stance now.

Just people stupid mean lying us science behind serious virus right way things. going end way worse NY Keeping us sick trapped country full morons led moron crime humanity. R0 measles ranged 3.7-203. 

There still much don’t know virus. six months pandemic, coronavirus infected 11 million people worldwide, killing 525,000. despite increasing toll, scientists still definitive answer one fundamental questions virus: deadly it?

A firm estimate could help governments predict many deaths would ensue virus spread control. figure, usually called infection fatality rate, could tell health officials expect pandemic spreads densely populated nations like Brazil, Nigeria India.

In even poorer countries, lethal threats like measles malaria constant hard budget choices routine, number could help officials decide whether spend oxygen concentrators ventilators, measles shots mosquito nets.

The question became even complex last month, Centers Disease Control Prevention released data suggesting every documented infection United States, 10 cases average gone unrecorded, probably mild asymptomatic.

If many asymptomatic infections thought, virus may less deadly appeared. even calculation difficult one.

On Thursday, World Health Organization held two-day online meeting 1,300 scientists around world, agency’s chief scientist, Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, said consensus I.F.R. 0.6 percent — means risk death less 1 percent.

Although note this, 0.6 percent world’s population 47 million people, 0.6 percent American population 2 million people. virus remains major threat.

At present, countries different case fatality rates, C.F.R.’s, measure deaths among patients known Covid-19. cases, number highest countries virus longest.

According data gathered New York Times, China reported 90,294 cases Friday 4,634 deaths, C.F.R. 5 percent. United States close mark. 2,811,447 cases 129,403 deaths, 4.6 percent.

Those percentages far higher rates 2.5 percent death rate often ascribed 1918 flu pandemic. Still, difficult measure fatality rates pandemics, especially beginning.

In chaos ensues new virus hits city hard, thousands people may die buried without ever tested, certainly without autopsied.

It never entirely clear many died virus many died heart attacks, strokes ills. happened New York City Wuhan, China, outbreak began.

Normally, chaos subsided, testing done mild cases found — denominator fraction rises, fatality rates fall. results always consistent predictable.

Ten sizable countries, Western Europe, tested bigger percentages populations United States, according Worldometer, gathers statistics. Iceland, Denmark, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Britain, Israel New Zealand.

But case fatality rates vary wildly: Iceland’s less 1 percent, New Zealand’s Israel’s 2 percent. Belgium, comparison, 16 percent, Italy Britain 14 percent.

Both figures — infection fatality rate case fatality rate — differ quite bit country.

So far, countries, 20 percent confirmed Covid-19 patients become ill enough need supplemental oxygen even advanced hospital care, said Dr. Janet Diaz, head clinical care W.H.O.’s emergencies program.

Whether patients survive depends host factors, including age, underlying illnesses level medical care available.

Death rates expected lower countries younger populations less obesity, often poorest countries. Conversely, figures higher countries lack oxygen tanks, ventilators dialysis machines, many people live far hospitals. also often poorest countries.

The W.H.O. various charities scrambling purchase oxygen equipment poor middle-income nations coronavirus spreading.

And now, new factors introduced equation. example, new evidence people Type blood likely fall deathly ill could change risk calculations. Type blood relatively rare West Africa South Asia, rare among Indigenous peoples South America.

Before week’s meeting, W.H.O. official I.F.R. estimate, Oliver Morgan, agency’s director health emergency information risk assessment, said interview early June.

Instead, relied mix data sent member countries academic groups, meta-analysis done May scientists University Wollongong James Cook University Australia.

Those researchers looked 267 studies dozen countries, chose 25 considered accurate, weighting accuracy averaged data. concluded global I.F.R. 0.64 percent.

The C.D.C. relies “symptomatic case fatality ratio” “is necessarily equivalent number reported deaths per reported cases.” best estimate United States 0.4 percent, according set planning scenarios released late May.

The agency respond requests explain arrived figure, much lower W.H.O.’s estimate. comparison, 0.4 percent United States population 1.3 million people.

The 25 studies Australian researchers considered accurate relied different methodologies. One report, example, based diagnostic PCR tests passengers crew aboard Diamond Princess, cruise ship docked Japan overcome coronavirus. Another study drew data antibody survey 38,000 Spaniards, another included 1,104 Swedes.

The current W.H.O. estimate based later, larger studies many people antibodies blood; future studies may refine figure, Dr. Swaminathan said.

But “a lot uncertainty” many silent untested carriers are, Dr. Morgan W.H.O. said.

To arrive C.D.C.’s new estimate, researchers tested samples 11,933 people antibodies coronavirus six regions United States. New York City reported 53,803 cases April 1, actual number infections 12 times higher — nearly 642,000, agency estimated.

New York City’s prevalence 7 percent C.D.C. study well 21 percent estimated state survey April. number based people recruited supermarkets, results may biased toward people shopping pandemic — often young, less affected.

The global fatality rates could still change. one two exceptions, like Iran Ecuador, pandemic first struck wealthier countries Asia, Western Europe North America advanced medical care available.

Now spreading widely India, Brazil, Mexico, Nigeria countries millions crowded slums, lockdowns relatively brief hospitals resources.

But death rates may also shift wealthier northern countries winter approaches. spread virus Europe North America taken place mild warm weather spring summer.

Many experts fear infections deaths shoot fall colder weather forces people indoors, likely infect one another. Discipline wearing masks avoiding breathing one another even important then.

In eight influenza pandemics hit United States since 1763, relatively mild first wave — matter time year arrived — followed larger, much lethal wave months later, noted Michael T. Osterholm, director Center Infectious Disease Research Policy University Minnesota.

More third people killed Spanish flu, lasted March 1918 late 1920, died short stretch September December 1918 — six months first, relatively mild version may virus broke western Kansas.

“We go much higher next 12 18 months,” Dr. Osterholm said. coronavirus, influenza, may follow pattern, “a much efficient transmitter influenza.”

People whine Reddit lots people Texas least half taking seriously now... think people sick stuck inside figure 3 months enough.

The thing would state closed borders. common sense. saying done that, staying facts here.

Look NZ. completely closed borders mostly gone now.

If Texas southern states thing actually enforced jt, could back open almost fully now. we'd talking states could form travel bloc.

Instead people states moving around spreading it. places accused underreporting others accused underreporting. 

It's simple, look expected v actual deaths location. (The drawback data takes 8 weeks average collect accurately, still gives best idea big impact virus area.) 

Expected deaths + covid deaths equal actual deaths reporting correct.

For example, argument people dying car crashes counted covid death. Well, raise Death count expected amount. widespread problem, we'd see actual deaths expected+covid deaths. 

What US whole shows actual deaths expected+covid deaths, many think they're underreported. state tells  Even know, uncertainty around it, would safest sanest assumption anyway, proven otherwise. So, piece ""news"" really change anything. Agreed. mother lives immunocompromised isolating since March. know terribly miss friends? going bar drink tap? Entering store browsing?

I’ve met RNs believe shit. guess see modern medicine fail enough they’re skeptical. Statistics/the scientific method wasn’t strong lot nurses graduated with. weren’t required solo research school attended I’m pretty sure group projects nurses make through. live town like 15% got tested believe completely. mandatory tested find out.

It caused domino effect every aspect life, worse, fear.. 

But let’s try change next generation. talked old guy bike uptown.  drove around drunk years. couple years clean he's happy.  said he's enough close calls life, he's wearing mask. possibility mask usage reduces initial virus load. Virus load shown correlate severity illness, get sick wearing mask might get much less severe case disease. Use facts numbers moment ... everyone wrong everything far can’t say “ maybe 20 million infected people symptoms “ 

Maybe ,

Anyone Florida here? situation ground 4th July, tons parties w packed full people masks ?!? appears behaving appropriately pandemic highly unamerican. RIGHT thing!!  Shutting stupid start. can’t blame her. reason NY CT well virus burned two states? 

those 2 states? 

burned out?

**Stanford UCSF among hospitals treating COVID-19 patients Imperial County along Mexican state.. virus.. 

virus burn out. 

masks+social distancing means virus can't find new hosts.  KS resident, confirm it’s inside perspective too. many people thread going ignorant rambling bullshit clearly fucking clue talking insane. mods need take stand start moderating kind shit going spread disinformation. get mods knowledgeable stuff tell people bullshitting ban people much harm.

Half people talking like they're superior totally ""knew this"" months ago even know airborne means. Hmm, maybe behaviors something parent responsible for.

My kids great Thank kind words. really mean lot. glad mine managed bring least tiny bit comfort. Trump even top 10 worst presidents Thats actually good point. Would nice establish sort baseline symptom severity compared say maybe March. I'm curious sick people really are. lived FL would understand real question many people think nose mask work. see dumb people around. Though reports published different authors four-year period

How relevant /r/Coronavirus ? We've known questionable papers come China decades now. questionable papers coming China Coronavirus generally ripped shreds knowledgeable epidemiologists Twitter soon they're uploaded.

But papers reputable authors publishing non-sensationalized findings well replicated subsequent findings across globe. Historians going case studies total failure leadership 50 years. nation decline looks like. Probably miserable stranger things happened odds. may able partake craft front center anymore could ""write"", ""direct"" etc.  lives 5 years happy still crafting work whatever capacity might make difference. I'm saying would fun like ever count anyone proverbial fat lady sings. remember April: ""NY outlier, happen anywhere else US"" Can't open windows, students choose stay inside 110F outside.

In area, lot people think Coronavirus joke, masks muzzles people. also 0 respect educators, that's cool.

I'm thinking getting school IT. Aside nearly impossible get into, it? I’ve wondered maybe wearing like working assumption droplets coming mouth only....

Otherwise, can’t wrap head around you’d wear incorrectly 20 beds keep adding tents needed, bingo bongo simple! idea Sweden massively faking numbers always laughable know ever got pushed subreddit. They're EU member state ton oversight. point trust numbers reasonable, trust anyone. Except, accept. necessarily. inexpensive easy access, doctor, nurses specialists underpaid. heard yesterday running behind 240,000 medical personnel. 5% thought 1%. 

Not antagonizing. Trying learn. find anything googling. I'll try search later. anything could read ? wife teacher Michigan. Current plan elementary kids required mask up. Teachers staff masks, wife N95. uncomfortable September A/C running safety first.

One thought wall wall plastic barrier separate teacher students, much gets lost happens. Even masks tough facial cues tough read without seeing faces.

I think push comes shove remote come fall, though. OP likely millenial/zoomer barring comorbidities much better odds coronavirus. dad concerned responsible though... totally agree really hard them, arguably harder adults. It’s really encouraging many teens understand way bigger them. I’m saying over-inflated, I’ve heard lot people America still believe virus hoax say numbers aren’t reported correctly make seem worse actually We're pretty well tri state area, NY, CT, NJ. Makes nervous people coming states also least considerate citizens generally least likely travel all, they're even less likely passport. ones going travel likely something like take cruise Caribbean drive Canada take cruise there.

Obviously plenty dumbasses travel. think borders Canada open up, especially 14 day quarantine anyone coming in, bad might think amount people come in. I'm really saying could probably scale back worry maybe 10 25 percent, number course pulled ass think makes sense. Thank you. settle alright. Six feet down. attitude Hamilton change? Five years ago everybody loved it, everybody seems hate varying reasons. Get sweet sweet human lube coins slide right slots imagine boomer see's earlier Fatalities lag vents available. people intubated days resources we’re becoming scarce things started change.

But also ignores fact Florida actively reporting covid deaths. look year year “pneumonia” death comparison. Thank idiot White House making “anti-American.” hell managed politicize pandemic beyond me. It’s national heath crisis, Christ’s sake. politics involved. At. All. money would also need provide kids. agree anecdote means. teach high school. kids get it. Several parents many grandparents already dead virus. know done, doesn’t mean it’s less nerve racking stuck home. They’re trying find independence grow up.

And say “WAY WORSE”

Not mention cases jumped factor 10 Florida, deaths actually fairly constant. hit peak early May (67 deaths per day 3 day average) trended last week popped little 60 deaths per day)

It’s interesting texas refused follow plans reopen, likely close again. Even simply requiring masks distancing spaces would probably allow economy stay open. I’m Texas, state similar attitude, I’m going all. people would wear masks, I’d go rather buying online. Think celebrated... idiots came idiots! think they've found large bodies water?

Are enough facts you? conference scheduled Lake Tahoe August got cancelled back March. time pretty pissed, ""No way things bad August!"" Well, guess got showed. Didn’t know wasn’t dating mike Comrie anymore Protests cannot explain sustained rate increase transmission rate. protests responsible would seen spike decline. seen therefore protests responsible situations seeing now. clearly botched re-opening lack mask wearing. mean? isn’t adequate PPE. It’s cheap plan contingencies relied time possible rapidly ramp demand. problem major pandemic everyone trying increase demand capacity supply becomes limiting factor.

By time March/April came along, longer real shortage surgical masks China reopened. N95 still issue, still ways source good ones cheaply go direct manufacturer. It’s middlemen cronyism delayed lot also marked prices insane levels. know people basically purchased flipped masks profit 30-40%. capital contracts government contacts sell. could find somewhere cheap, flew plane transport nice profit made.

The US UK months prepare still caught pants due lack information lack trying hard enough adopting “that alright” kind mentality. months “alright” till wasn’t.

The issue problem still shortages everywhere one talking anymore it’s old news! incredibly lucky. I've working hazard pay. wish would've smarter this. least paid risking lives there, solely talking cops doctors, anyone would step door. 

It sucks :/ Protesters almost entirely masked, outdoors makes huge difference. live weird see headline.

Anyways hospitals county also pretty low beds. I’m depressed hell, don’t sleep like used WTF happened species? humans devolving?

**And yet still people think like this...**

*Permanent* smoking bans introduced many years ago response health risk damage associated second-hand smoke deemed intelligent reasonable, expect, yet *temporary* measures requiring people wear mask, social distance, etc, response pandemic that's inflicting massive damage country, deemed people stupid, unreasonable, unacceptable, infringement rights... WTF!

**Stupidity/Arrogance/Ignorance Level?... Max. Level Reached...** Sounds like mask might porous. Or, contact outside mask surface, perhaps. 

Your story frightens me, b/c take similar precautions. Scam? shits perfectly legal. Hey man, totally feel this. three kids (one 7mo) totally sucks. productivity toilet enjoyed working home I’m constantly interrupted. kids gone back daycare except baby past two weeks it’s nerve wracking so. going back school won’t help either, boss likely want us back office point.

There ""returning normal"" people want vaccine, get one...and alk thepeople refuse vaccone buried.

I see return normal lifetime, frankly. last sentence, ugh. seems like assuming TINIEST amount virus enough cause infection. 

If cloth face masks contain larger droplets tiniest aerosols escaping, still much lower viral load air? many aerosols one need inhale get infected? ... possible takes quite lot larger droplets? E-bola

It's computer virus lol. going take leave needed. Luckily im LA insisting protecting vulnerable staff. see works Well makes everything difficult.

Let’s say two families want socialize otherwise maintain social distancing isolation. agree go pick groceries store (using pickup service going store itself), get gas, etc. app could used voluntary tracking device could say “this person stopped location previously reported,” letting second family know may exposure elsewhere. 

The overall goal would help maintain trust communication. lot people say distancing later “forget” inform family “oh yeah, stopped family birthday party minutes, big deal” results exposure everyone involved. Many people staying completely isolated possibility, could maybe mitigated app like this? 132,000 dead *with lockdown social distancing*. never take precautions flu. use Texas style saying, ""That's like closing barn door horse bolted"".

That said; Texas, Florida, Arizona, Cali serious Hospital space issues. Add onto list Czech Republic, western example. really know much scenario, except pandemic mostly passed by, also went full-on masks. Bruh chill virus isn’t even bad. think bacteria easily treated antibiotics. CA probably will, AZ/TX presumably won’t. We're fucked country species. pandemic proven chance ever beating climate change :( Hi appreciate explaining...however people discouraged getting fmla. explanation...if covid makes scared work asthma &amp; HIGH RISK qualify fmla &amp; may well issues.

Canada: 2.8 million tests 37.59 million people, 7.4% tested, 3.7% positive rate overall 

The US higher per capita testing rate, covid can’t feasibly traced contained 9% positive rate. US still testing enough. [It kind looks like this, smaller less beat heat now, he's got fan tiny tub filled water, sits card table, soak feet in.

The kids pretty good too. help make ""Fort rules"" (which hilariously taped tent). genius way get kids understand/pretend workspace.

He gets decent WiFi too. like idea giving people discounts mask wearing stores. encourages behavior without preachy said, he's clearly trying best articulate risk he'd advise it. 

Fauci said did, time, young people seen high risk group. later learnt virus, know younger people also risk. nothing tip toeing around anybody worried getting fired. 

My point know virus, advice given actions taken, change. normal. unreasonable take additional information know **today** criticize **back then**. Someone city selling radio, vinyl player, cassette player, etc thing going get. Nah, get it. get money week. reporting pneumonia related deaths covid-19. 

This back june shows 120,000 deaths unexplained attributed covid-19. 

Hmmm wonder could Yesterday US reported fewest number coronavirus deaths since March 22. (Source: Worldometers.info) seems significant me, mention news could find. death rates trending overall. main reason given it’s mostly younger people getting now, makes sense me. Also, better idea treat it. part wonders virus mutating less deadly. Thoughts? ...and this, folks, flatten curve. Walking house =/= teaching Petri dish classroom 7 hrs day, 5 days week 100 100 thousand next month late. Hospitals handle 100 cases overwhelmed.

I thought went enough times past 6 months. incredible people still understand simple concept. wrong. plenty Europeans act dumb wearing masks protesting well. here. I’m Saint Petersburg.

Yeah understand willing accept personal risk it’s US Intelligence briefed Trump administration back November new virus brewing China. administration told intelligence important.

We could proactive least minimozed spread virus, instead jackshit letting spread every corner nation. can’t educate ignorant choice. look #1. It’s also wish non mask wearers would sign waiver seek medical care get sick Austin too. manage get test, seems actively symptomatic, takes couple days even get in, saying 7-10 days results backlog building up. said done time get results pointless, least purpose trying work right now. either sick know it, able go back work wait, employer say screw risk it.

Qu’ils mangent de la brioche Governor DumSantis saying this? wrong extra space, proposed locally. However still need teachers to, well, teach. dividing class size half effectively double amount teachers employed school. Staggered times could help alleviate still need teachers resources pre pandemic. Add 20% budget cut we're facing state see school district reopen financially, let alone health reasons. social distance water... No, let's drag 100k cases per day stuff want ranked lower supposed notice. People really realize many grandparents volunteer schools preform essential functions, like one one reading help Assuming find nurses staff them.

It blows mind could even consideration shortage nurses.

I say area, virus barely touched, dozens nurses laid off. word corp meeting one major hospitals, usually means layoffs. need nurses plenty lot America could use jobs. pelosi schumer big tartarz side. accept fact cared would done something now. Romulus destroyed Hobus Supernova. area nuts last night. amount people way usual family parties zero people wearing masks.

As much want go back lockdown whole thing truly fascinating look real American psyche. feel like recent spike caused lot people go deep end. I’m even seeing return lockdown vaccine group. dumb words. yes, wear mask like that. less riffraff left take resources over. Thanks media live clicks. Yeah, honestly can’t this? accept year off— redo 21-22 school year? I'm saying shelter place, I'm saying we've decided shelter place already let's right.

Go mad policy makers, stop shaming individuals relatively responsible thing outside. Vents time place. Exactly this. thought lowering curve giving hospitals time amount patients take deliver service customers promised. get can't go life normal, unfortunately going certain amount cases hospital system needs try handle many cardassians! topic already deleted moderator topic.

You guarantee teachers die protection priority state. Maybe they're referencing fact many places saying virus new say total longterm immunity possible? agree however indication virologists doctors 100% get sick normal functioning immune system. read something way back march two patients China getting sick claim seem fact checked. Hospitalizations Houston??? Oh, incredibly high... June/ July. everyone knows peak flu season. Come already. This. Almost everyone know still getting together time family friends social distancing. long people keep this, virus still spread although probably slower rate.

A local leaders try advice people stick households right numbers high. Unfortunately don’t think talked enough people don’t want admit they’d stay away family members extended period time. sympathy you: 0/10 Well, ya got point work retail store closed reopened last month. state, masks encouraged required. sign door saying masks expected, customer asks tell “no, they’re required.” two people working doors. One counting people coming going (we 25% capacity even capacity watch queue make sure there’s five people hold door) one cleans shopping carts customers need them. yesterday I’m door counting coworker cleaning carts. man coming in, pulling mask plastic wrap coworker tells “no, don’t need that.” Wtf? going put on, discourage him? habit saying stuff like this. Let customers think need wear mask. say don’t I’m directly asked. another coworker refuses wear mask nose unless management around. Like, I’m happy work, coworkers making harder us? already three people right now. Two confirmed case one contacted contact tracer told quarantine. Sorry, isn’t serious post, needed rant somewhere. don’t see cost medical care responsibility malls. It’s unfair fail controlling virus ask businesses something may little effect don’t reduce infections low enough, don’t enough compliance masks, etc. Maybe that’s issue New York, Idk. Proper air filtration link flimsy chain human behavior links many humans. 

I agree it’s good lower cost prevention, pays it? govt pay required compliance short term provide kind incentive, stick. money come nobody shopping months? end many brick mortar add exorbitant operating costs pay rent. could matter different filters installed, could mean lot more. I’m indoor air quality improvements public safety could also mean complete overhaul hvac system building. don’t know details seems like there’s ways go don’t involve top-down orders. small outside BBQ weekend. Maybe 10 adults, mix parties, education, beliefs. 8 10 eager try new vaccine. reasons ranged medical conspiracy united distrust rushed vaccine. government and/or medical community lot work do. think R leadership ability enforce it. They've neutered small gov arguments ""personal liberties"". They'd lose support tried judicially enforce anything.  Combing someone's post/comment history one saddest creepiest things person do. Seriously, find productive way spend time. fact, I'm going set example right wasting time engaging 😃 ✌ MLB start back There’s people sub generally like seeing terrifying numbers, them, virus political issue, instead humanity agree 99% Gottlieb states, damn change name Dr. Doom. Canada definitely 2 party system. Thailand, Japan, Vietnam, Taiwan Southeast Asian countries get largest volume chinese tourists around world. covid spreading undetected China months, countries cases?

These additional details warrant additional investigation one draw conclusions. fuckers rush anything name vaccine whether effective not. wins re-election concede “vaccine” wasn’t effective scientists hoped. Please let kindergarteners know longer accepting morning hugs cry, can’t pat back. Let students autism flight risk longer stop running away across busy roads. 

My point being, physical distancing possible job. Correction - way contain spread period. every country planet. I’m open Medicare honestly think would great... wealth tax? Considering almost 20% unemployment lock down, don’t think that’ll work. Tax wealthy sure... normal people aren’t working, rich companies make less money means lay offs selling assets. 

A tax would compound issue even further. stimulus checks help, let’s honest won’t get family by. universal income speak would cause lot economic woe though may save lives probably ruin lot financially like small business even normal family working make ends meet.

It’s necessarily people don’t want pay it. It’s some, economic destruction could worse number people dying virus. spared 100,000 lives ruined 10 million financially might recover except bankruptcy... that’s tough choice decide me, right/good answer here. virus killed people lot often choice would MUCH easier. kills seemingly less 1% people part people hard time think. Police forces across country said whole significant issues. worries, communication like important going forward together. Certainly acceptable! CHYNA. STOP. 100%.... wrong Reminder exacerbated probably cherry-picked stories; know many 100+ year olds manage make Spanish Flu Covid, actually significant. man himself: good him! nice, triumphant story. Yes Mayor, politician somewhere decided ~~money~~ economy important lives, bought ""it's fLu bRo!"" rhetoric. dick might fall years. yep sure shit vaccine election thinking. mean people schedule big trip like that, lot goes it. Disney expensive itself. People go motions taking leave work, flight plans, etc. remained closed taken people's money. close down, going really piss people off. Corporate greed predictable. Disney opening two airlines packing flights, could happen? Texas keeps nothing even try quell this.

What fuck waiting for? kind grand scale disaster need see order something????? uneducated ignorant science deniers. trashy... plan sounds good, day test matter type test, time-range (8 days potential exposure) good get. (See interested research accuracy) aware incubation period happens super long develop symptoms test come back negative may worth get another test. Bar reopenings went really well TX, FL, AZ. Carry on. Carry on. Seems getting nation wide clinical use Peru. clinical trial underway, results expected July. sure either. It’s California, boot. probably done 2-3 weeks. would take several months bring cases down. rest said agree with. People RGV retarded. heart goes you. Ideally, one possible solution could restrict in-person learning kids like yours. course, scenario comes flaws well.

As teacher parent, get much sucks around. entire country watched Minneapolis' people burn police station down. right. brother law taught online classes. averaged one student class, condensed students school tutoring sessions teacher would work one day. worked one day every two weeks shutdown.

All im saying every frontline worker accept risks. Yet moment teachers thrown in, hell breaks loose. education really frontline always says is, essential needs happen. Great. now. hope so. I'm downplaying bad is. acutely aware.

My point none hospitals actually Tampa specifically person commenting said sister was.

I mean, I'm fully aware areas bay. I've lived four decades.

My larger point directed person commenting Tampa bad level yet, mostly way provide little tangential relief fear. [God sometimes feels like this. know y'all boat. Misery loves company something like that. least Florida! would anyone want stuck America pandemic **pay-to-live healthcare system**. 

Nobody wants stuck here. even voted current crazy President realize universal healthcare probably better them, considering amount layoffs. still realize that, well, can't fix stupid. Chappelle running office, least [modern solution healthcare I'm sorry, claim exactly? 

It seems one misrepresenting truth. work one hospitals article. really bad here. covid patients low acuity. really pretty normal outside fact there's a.lot bed availability. work ICU everything seemed normal people could transfered ICUs.... Looks like containment option. clue got downvotes.  Shit videos ICU news prior Covid ...they never looking good, American healthcare toitoi...hopefully get good resident care need medical attention Thanks. quite interesting. Im sorry robbing stores, destroying private public properties protest no....'cause mostly trash. almost wonder people infecting others purpose get rid people life.... Doctors nurses? admins? deny healthcare doctor's wishes interesting stories! 

This sort Japan expecting went, I'd heard similar stories, times definitely changed.

The time felt guilty hell felt like everyone watching judging went Atomic Bomb Museum Hiroshima. American day, definitely felt quite bit ashamed American there. went English speaking tour guide day, came explained Japanese days harbor ill it, instead feel ""shikata ga nai"", cannot helped. dark period everyone involved, cannot helped. say come 80's 90's though, still many resented Americans happened, might safe there. 

We went Miyajima Island visit shines, prayed there, left offerings, got licked deer. (Because deer Miyajima basically domesticated, like Nara) CNN MSNBC NBC literally American media television shows create promote stereotypes. European Middle Eastern television much better, less biased less commentary based. Yes, there’s testing bottleneck, hasn’t shortage months. can’t force people take tests it’s encouraged anyone symptoms possible exposure, want test get (for free). born them. I'm afraid that's limit knowledge topic, maybe move question ? people hang actual virologists. Actually, Cardassians would probably uber-strict infection control compliant government regulations. see something Dominion would do, though. Aw it’s deleted say? Pretty much.. “association” since state Right Work. bargaining power union. girlfriend told friends back home HOUSE WARMING party.

WTF. could imagine useless get together. school planning reopen hazard surrounding community teachers/students. stopped governor. Fucking insane. ??

We social distancing time, still overwhelmed hospitals.

Because essential workers traveling essential jobs subway without masks.

Not hard understand. exactly. Even we're better treating (we're pretty much making educated guesses something sticks), mean benign illness. associated strokes, permanent lung damage, many things. nationwide death down!! simpson's paradox??? far I’ve read, HCQ effective shortening time mild symptoms, effective reducing death rate critical condition. Similar Remedisivir Certainly much higher 100 people. far, clusters detected, restrictions imposed testing ramps up. happened Beijing. extreme lockdown like Wuhan. No, sorry. Remember early days r/coronavirus saw complete shutdown collapse Chinese hospitals?

Coming America soon. Brazil found trace virus sewage samples back Nov. 2019, France found early Dec. 2019, Spain even found one Mar. 2019. impossible China first one discover outbreak virus came somewhere else. honestly sounds devastating. many new orphans &amp; half-orphans. :(  got away Sandbridge bit. Drove VB proper yeeeeeeesh. That's raw data numbers. raw numbers July 3rd 460 newly confirmed cases 10 a.m. July 2nd 10 a.m. July 3rd. raw numbers. graph shows date symptom onset, date specimen collection date, date positive test received. hear you. got called back retail phone store job almost 2 weeks ago now. End last year already come terms fact want sales anymore I'm salesman heart. want something helps people want manipulate customers getting things need pandemic. want be. 

I well job personable, believe. last couple years always fall behind I'm aggressive enough. I've 9 years, I'm manager store wanted long time. I've put much it. 

Its every day went leave even EVERY day filled stress anxiety. GF high risk poor immune system. feel guilty still feel trapped. everyone downplaying caring. Idk fucked feeling around fucked situation. 

Didn't mean make me. started commenting say understand feel here's why. Went rant feels pretty bad. Can't talk family peers none get it. 

Anyway. Good look friend know alone. You’re right. mistake, flattened end May stayed steady mid June, sky rocketed since. president literally won’t seen public wearing mask. PLEASE DEFEND lying? country 10 week lockdown pandemic started. country dicked around months instead preparing. country still coherent strategy, leadership, national public health regulations. Could factors, perhaps, explain discrepancy? Yes.. virus fill holes lungs **reduce lung capacity (and don’t know long term implications)**... scary.. merely looking death rate pointless Kansas again? gotta aliens softening us invasion. I'm pretty sure making joke. FYI They're wrong time read article equated (refusing wear mask public = drunk driving)

Why double standards accepting authority governments (that elect) protecting herd!? smart enough put two two together social distancing lock downs worked ? look mean yeah, that's NYC...dug mass grave island. Isn’t dummy too? believe economic aspect brainer well especially using eastern models benchmark recovery prosperity. think it’s goddamn hilarious countries banning travel US. Likely risk buys. Hope first works, buy 2 case first fails testing. still getting paid either a) worked shutdown b) 10 month pay split 12 checks. one getting paid vacation. Remember Trump said speech [“insurance companies waive co pays coronavirus treatments” lapdog walk back say it’s actually testing. turns getting tested counts doctors visit test copay lol

Such cluster fuck Wait, anyone original text? 

Similar stuff happened reporting Japanese outbreak year correct translation/interpretation would ""the epidemic Japan"" ""the Japan epidemic"". It’s actually good lesson modern human society need consideration evidence, opposed rush judgment based limited apparent information.

We’ve since learned Romulans destroyed rescue fleet shipyard, it’s provocation Iconians via pre-destination paradox created incident. Blaming Spock like blaming worn-out EMT able save gunshot victim, without even asking victim shot.

Was Nero blaming first appearance cancel culture in-universe? using red matter black hole destroy Vulcan ultimate ‘cancel’?  Prison don’t know you’re getting downvoted speak truth. university refunded dorm fees, remaining money food plans, fees parking permits. let infect, eliminate, itself. Right, that's one day. Look number started nearly 20k less day months ago average. Also number match source provide going date posted.

That Saturday 60k tests Sunday 52k tests.

Those numbers match 42k vs 71k, unless I'm missing data point Haha calm man. Weve told hospitals decimated months months. emergency hospitals military constructed never even used. ICUs states capacity.

We need protect elderly comorbidities. One really nasty consequences people busy like “America WTF doing” they’ll overlook China Hong Kong Xinjiang. Yes came China, US one sustaining virus's spread now. think doctors admitting many don’t necessarily need there? trach imagine they're social connection rather drinks. helps situation. heard takes 6 months set new “melt blown” material machine. isn’t easy increase n95 production rate. Yeah quit. exactly. worth owners could wait another phase open. They’re forcing hand. Fuck them. hope closes greed makes fail. Amazing recommendation go ur normal
business “but keep distance” infected? true would seen similar spike NYC multiple protests every day like 6 weeks. virus wouldn’t spread first place China didn’t create perfect conditions new viruses spread. 🤷‍♀️  nephew working 20 hours week delivering pizzas right now, making BANK. Stop lying. may intelligent average science denier. Ive seen assload folks reddit, sadly two weeks? thought overwhelmed already? researched it, found Facebook posts agreed them. Ya, needs host live multiply, live varying periods time outside host. 

If stomach kill it, would make slightly harder eaten. infected, also happen touch proper spot mouth esophagus. 

Wheras hands pick something teeth rub eyes direct. someone explain viral load really means? Like even virus passes A/C potent someone coughing face? I'm sorry sir we're convinience. got nothing  article. China, correct!! Non American here, pays treatment get COVID end ICU? honest, dont think worse NY. 

Even majority people arent wearing masks, number people wearing one. small numbers makes difference. 

Also see difference people behaviors washing hand often, standing apart other. 

So overall I'm ready worst hope wont turn worse NY. said LIKE chocolate pudding chocolate pudding students probably going fine get it. professors hand...not much.... they're testing enough conclusion draw data? meaningful then? increase testing monitor 'rate' all? Please tell 'very meaningful'? People east wearing masks like used to. pass masks stop it. simply peak leave, like NYC places it. mean joking, also probably correct. least could take time spell name right. Well, beer gardens opening (Scotland) tomorrow. Yes. smart sending students home well. Trains went specific destinations train cars reserved students specific colleges. could federal mandates resources. 4th biggest metro area North America


Looks like cluster seven ten, millions fourth. no, point people do. 

NY happened NOBODY wearing mask even try stand apart.

This time people staying home, wearing masks, social distance.

[Small numbers makes Ok that's encouraging. know brother spread parents quickly I'm scared Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* California. cars front neighbors houses disappeared went go party elsewhere enjoyed nice staycation. Super spreaders? Oh mean 10x infectors. I'm pretty glad I'm upper-division History major now. :) think I’m nervous schools burying heads sand going ahead reopening, hoping best. Seems reckless. Thanks providing context. still people covid ICU, significantly far overwhelming health care system. Banks special doors locked outside push get inside needed. school worked safety, lot smaller little businesses won’t budget put in. always order directly business can. specific, referring groceries Publix previously. worked 10 years, I'm confident least case they're OK. stores high end grocery store south east, always super busy unfortunately people can't bothered following simple rules social distancing masks store risk pissing Karen (their bread butter).

You're right though general, sure anybody would order via 3rd party order direct. restaurants offer delivery, guess either take I'll eat elsewhere. gets followers infected, ones die recovered election day worried heading polls. Pretty poor argument m'dude. That’s great! gives little faith seeing businesses care choose right thing. none tourists use restrooms/restaurants/bars/grocery stores/gas stations? Thanks! got this, inch inch. let’s take deaths picture. Chalk “oh well shit happens, flu bad, look number survivors”. putting summary Facebook comments see. survivors averaging [11 hospital. United States cannot handle that. hospital system based get in, get done, get out, free bed. shift ICU patients around system can’t handle adding millions people staying hospital almost two weeks top current medical needs nation. people also heavy users medical resources. go make masks ventilators cannot easily add medical personnel hospital beds. convert gymnasium it’s storage place lacking hospital level care.

When people go hospital things like car wrecks deep cuts triaged hospital already full from
Covid patients, reality sink “it’s worse flu” people. blood consistency pudding, would dead 28.1% teachers 50+ years old. 

Even shy side 65, risk serious issues result infection much higher 50s average. Shameful. hamburgers important PPE? really. get like “fuck China! fuck BLM protests spread virus everywhere” remember reading household transmission rate like 19% long time ago  Lol issue LOT money required (potentially hiring far teachers cover smaller class sizes make sure remote aspect covered also) make viable

This true. Theoretically, one could say teenagers except special needs would go school online fall, districts could open high schools younger students, help social distancing per classroom.

That works terms physical classroom space, though. address issue finding additional qualified teachers, certainly address matter paying them, since schools funded local level often operate shoestring is. someone wanted buy one, like last Friday Lol “Too scary kids.” total load. Kids resilient, get used anything. explain case, like wearing helmet riding bike, fine. It’s adults don’t want wear mask pawn kids. son autism, uncomfortable people. made cloth one favorite color, told make sure don’t get Omas (grandmas) sick, fine. looks people wearing mask like committed unholy crime. dare risk Omas! thinks overblown

This whole thing really bringing interesting subsets deniers. would think nurse would get caught that. friend mine, respect intelligent person never buys conspiracy theory crap, saying overblown long time. gave admitted wrong. think it’s really difficult people seeing extreme changes required lives respond threat really seems invisible areas.  Well people pointing death rate completely ignoring fact there’s lot area healthy dead. may die, may go hell come side long term health problems. So? would admit q moron? Good luck everything! I’ve watching influenza virus too! shitshow would two pandemics basically top other. American sucks. practice social distancing safe want. I'm one person. 4th July felt like slap face. country doomed things turn around. High? virus show symptoms 5 days average? would June 30 so. Sure. throw away get pissed pubs.

I live california. locked properly start, too. changed behavior cases exploded. That's chosing do, too. absolutely reference number beds taken covid patients. reference number cases. know delayed medical treatments coming hospitals, now. Great... Spiders giant claws. What's upside running ICU beds I'm surprised there's 4 hospitals Tampa. still going people talking wrong hospitals overwhelmed?

Some people really can’t think beyond current moment it’s terrifying guy good fighting? seems like he's taken many shots head. What’s people education, normally understand (including people worked medical fields, even nurses) saying isn’t big deal. guess still math. blame administration more. Somehow they’ve made huge percent people feel like international pandemic work one group trying win one election control us. Sigh. Math. late? anything now? Even zoomers old excuse fit ten years old brat. known! know liar. That's matters. get here. sister plays basketball UC Berkeley. returned July 1st. Fingers crossed hrm comes there! thought everyone else snowflakes though!?  Unfortunately, I’m band teacher. Believe not, playing wind instruments excellent way spread airborne virus. He's right questionable mask studies there, feel like also way quick conclude cloth masks useless based CIDRAP's study, seemed founded belief coronavirus aerosolized contagious via aerosols measles. anti-mask crowd went wild quotes. take grain salt cause something heard somewhere know true is.


Earlier crisis, hospitals across United States dramatically increased number ICU beds available anticipation wave severe Covid-19 cases. time many jurisdictions temporarily halted elective procedures. country wave hospitalizations expected, never materialized. This, along halt elective procedures led low census numbers across country. Hospitals lost ton money many doctors nurses saw reduction hours, forced use PTO furloughed. 

As curve flattened case counts fell, many jurisdictions began allow elective procedures again. Many hospitals began scheduling procedures eliminating excess ICU beds. 


So, I've heard, hospitals want ICU beds 100% census. 100% good number, means making money. also hospitals quickly add ICU beds need arises, canceling rescheduling elective procedures. 

So situation quite dire made be. believe 45 genuinely least intelligent person ever elected president- believe IQ somewhere 80-90 range. genuinely believe he’s intelligent enough understand he’s doing.

Yes, number tested positive Covid-19 reflect true number Covid-19 infected. virus originated, transferred different species humans China bad hygiene conditions. virus able transfer humans China. even people merit hit homerun twice.. reason neglecting whats said looking talker..

People change..evolve...PROGRESS..

Well..not unfortunately :/ Reading article provided another explanation really interesting, related IGG IGM responses Japanese people. That's genius! 

I 6 person Coleman tent. could use folding table chair, run door power cord tent power, use outdoor splitter fan laptop. WiFi reaches well back yard, worse case scenario use powerline adapters.

I figure enough clearance sitting computer, plus gear there. tub part thing figure terms adding mist based cooling.

Ok. Time implement plan wife thinks nuts. much reach since testicles ACE2 receptors apparently. reserve sympathy people experiencing consequences actions they've warned constantly months. Well, Malaysia actually detect strain influenza virus rather less dangerous one. affect humans, yet Isn’t Covid treatment funded legislation? found one coworkers quarantined contact positive case came back.

My work tell anyone someone tests positive, it'll make people ""paranoid"" work. even forbidden telling coworker wear mask coughing, suggesting could infectious would frighten workers much. best time plant tree 20 years ago. second best time today. planted tree 18 months ago so, fucking glad (I abs first time entire life) :)

Do smoke weed? That’s secret weapon exercising (even walking around neighborhood - weed + good podcast phone call friend know I’ve walked 4 miles) know loop not, hospital ICUs ***are*** hitting max capacity now. Houston filled last week, Tampa Bay several hospitals already past full. Go read it.This hysteria. happening, need fucking something instead sitting around ignoring it. Nice spin! Well done!! reason can’t both. Imagine stupid hold sign says, “no contact tracing” That's 3 million top normal deaths. Oh hospitals get overwhelmed, able treat people things either, even deaths might even infected Covid hospitals enough staff rooms go around. bioterrorists winning war infect kill us all. know sarcasm, kind thinking got America mess first place.

Here Canada, one entered home past 3 1/2 months, including two ~20 year old kids.

We parents 50th anniversary party last night Zoom.

We've strongly encouraged travel outside neighborhoods unless critical. 

Stop trying visit places! contact tracing would nightmare. I'd also wager lot people virus live near/with idiots, they're idiots themselves. gotta feel :( Wow, teacher 90s would ask us put chairs top table even rare. Parents US would quickly file lawsuit kids told clean classroom. wonder think actual mortality rate is. there? heard couple months worse though. People still waiting several days test results Florida. figures reported tomorrow could already week old. add asymptomatic delay. I'll know I'm subbed zero waste sub. care little environment unable see concerns anything accessory argument contrary beliefs? since womb, also antibodies? 
Can antibodies transferred via breastmilk, assuming chose breastfeed? (-as much person reasonably could triplets!) would love get demographics people China trying take virus started COVERED blaming another nation MISTAKES. CHINA LIED DEC-JAN COVERED SEVERITY INITIAL OUTBREAK. CHINA innocent USA. No, alive people take hospital beds moment deceased. dead people. Problem liquid alcohol evaporates quickly.

Opening colleges universities huge danger surrounding community. truly insane stupid leaders would so. They'll probably open fall. Welp, means 20% world nothing worry about. 80% supposed do? I'll believe see solid data shows rate different demographics experience issues death. long term lung problems kidney issues causing diabetes neurological problems, I've read all. want know rates young, healthy populations. I've read way many preprint studies anecdotes make think rates going higher realized. Muslim-majority countries support Chinese policy Xinjiang don’t seem trouble making friends them.

Go bees! thousands otherwise healthy young people die pneumonia flu every year. That’s Except respiratory conditions like covid Less 15% inpatient beds Texas used covid patients. guys really believe that's unmanageable rookie numbers.

Sincerely, Florida. Trump still get pass. handling crisis bigger fuck-up anything happened China. Every time see someone Ugg boots south, think ""Their feet must stink!"" plain jello? Where’s vodka? Still even thread people overly optimistic downvoting dark scenarios. People US seem want realize enough patients, even modern country can't offer enough medical care. magically appear nurse, doctors, PPA, medication, on.  
 
It entire point initial lockdown example many EU countries: keep number patients manageable hospital care sufficient supply. 
 
If look Florida, 200k cases, 5% daily increase active cases... end well all. Remember NYC lockdown number cases peaked *they* manage. infinitely worse. could serving donors, be. Corruption something done extorting poor middle classes. came parking took narrow entrance ways beach

Outdoors again. problem. they're going go stores, bars restaurants near beach 

Good point, time beach. That's story pictures telling. far dangerous activities concentrated fighting, outrage focused. Complaining people outdoors beaches sending inaccurate message activities dangerous. However accuracy death numbers would argue high. 

After month, numbers stable... question accuracy. Consider this, period number deaths dropping significant proportion people tested.

Now read statistics deceased based data reported far Public Health Authority, differences regional reporting. statistics show number people **confirmed** covid-19 died, regardless cause death. 

 

If someone died without tested, likely would counted FHM numbers. everyone introspective willing accept personal responsibility want make masks mandatory, package delivery going struggle, work factory AC, one wears masks quickly sweat them, making almost impossible breathe through, see huge drop package handlers factories. exponential trend continues, they'll packing people halls holiday surge even hit. traveling nurse Florida list places NEVER work. heard many horror stories fellow travelers. top hospitals for-profit hell-holes regularly understaff assign patients nurses, pay literally laughable. don’t mandatory masks here. enough examples healthy young adults/children, comorbidities, died covid. assume frail/weak/unhealthy untrue misleading. throw snark link want, shouldn’t dismissed. accurate, believe need research long term effects confirm this, shaping policy response. 

The virus us vaccine effective treatment, goal minimizing deaths destroying lives needlessly blanket lock downs. like 5-9% America. saw earlier month old.

 Percentages sometimes make sense give enough information gauge situation. 

It may better include total number bed available, 13% ( = 13 beds) 13% (1 bed) available. Start wool socks Ugg boots lol Assuming course they’re actually capable giving shit anyone isn’t themselves, seems unlikely tbh... they're promising release independence day, one quarter month human trial period? 

I doubts. announced colour coded warning system lockdown, controlled independent body, 

It’s easy government use statistics agenda. 

The sage panel make call, like way Bank England decides interest rates. happened happened every country earth, problem differentiates cultures countries people not, take crazy chance basically political organization reluctant tell anybody anything want hear. Airborne transmission would expensive address, even everyone wearing cloth mask indoors aerosols accumulate poorly ventilated crowded space.

But hand-washing inexpensive tell us wash hands prevent spread airborne virus!

This pushes 5-10 days 5 days ago. maybe june 20th, june 22-25th.  fear people. concessions ending. Evictions starting again. Utility companies turning power again. Late fees back. growing balls debt going start crush people. governments, state federal, going step spend money need citizens.

I read May Columbia University study said 250k people US could become homeless pandemic. mention horrible homeless population already exists. 

Things going get dark dire. top that, people continue get sick die months come. resort nasty one. definitely wouldn’t allow employees stay there, barely allow us speak unless spoken to. eligible unemployment benefits (and it’s paid two weeks leave) unless dad tested positive covid. There’s literally nothing protecting risk actually it, complete bullshit. sure insurance coverage, highly doubt it. Can’t hurt check though. It’s difficult situation. Thank response, it’s greatly appreciated. Yup. Similar thing happened mother. spleen injury hospital 2 weeks. 350k bill. next year, lung cancer diagnosis. Surgery alone able fix 7 years later still cancer free. cancer surgery insurance said would longer cover her. made excuse business associated insurance plan father longer plan it. thing father 5 years older mother Medicare entire 5 years told mother this. wanted reason kick costing 500k.

Good point, think that. No, people left turning country fucking toilet non-constructive ""culture war"" people right turning country fucking toilet non-constructive ""culture war."" garbage time less childish pissy babies level heads take precedence *all* you. Same.

I'm super happy Toronto country/ city getting handle virus, equally upset handling US. wait til hurricanes start pummeling south...fucking hell going bad. Yep, think it’s great comparison even though people still drive drunk, pretty much *nobody* argue it’s ok. beds full covid patients. elective surgeries one would assume least half beds full patients, possibly comedy tragedy. mightiest country world, ignorance exceptionalism led this. Imagine Monty Python version this, Steve Carell American flair suppose. #1 topic interest among hospital execs.

You must nursing supervisor icu charge nurse icus full patients need intubated ventilated, fuck  posted ""How safely open universities: Taiwan's Experience"" r/taiwan text file allowed here. contains Taiwan CECC's detailed guidance universities back February. Taiwan opened universities Lunar New Year welcome back 120,000 foreign students (almost 1/4 mainland China). Different universities implemented guidelines differently. since then, Taiwan's universities 7 cases 6 universities. 

All public health officials need study guidelines. “death sentence” lol. people don’t take subreddit seriously anymore. That’s ridiculously overdramatic. can't wait April whole thing miraculously disappears. Lol U.S. Virus social distancing time, still overwhelmed hospitals

Metro areas sure. worst outcome imagine covid + mask shortage? give hints need essential workers traveling essential jobs subway without masks.

And mask shortage myth, hang whoever perpetrated it. wasn't, get throw tomatoes administration's trolley problem hard understand.

I know, could blind timeline fast food workers horde masks nurses wear advice cost lives.

That said ang decision pandemic. disingenuous say without comparing alternatives. honest.

Also keep mind 50% Fauci said small orange hand sock puppet thing. fully support findings whatever post-mortem reveals, even decides Fauci monster. money, however, folks. feel like life-long effects posts part, speculation pure creative writing. virus six months old. Everyone needs understand this. also found president rejects science 24/7 propaganda cable channel feeds fear hatred. happens young, perfectly healthy person virus catches flu bronchitis develops issue weakens system anyone? Play one mind bit. Might well start referring students 'revolving credit accounts receivable'. fake propaganda preparation bigot government seeks credit everything done frontline workers. makes happy. pneumonia death total reaches 1000% yearly avg, know like 10x worse already. feel same, quarantining, pickup groceries. husband back work office actual walls, cubicle, masks 2-3 people sees day masked. teacher 18 years, sub 2 yrs. went away I’m planning subbing time. wish could find work home situation. Online teaching jobs easy come by. Meanwhile, son family,including 2 precious grandchildren, totally quarantined don’t get see them. I’m so, sad it. hard time looking social media seeing everyone else’s get togethers. Sometimes get panicked hopelessness situation. linked Wikipedia page literally says, ""The CDC estimates 46,000 95,000 Americans died due influenza 2017-18 flu season.""

And flu season typically bit shorter current Corona-season, really want get pedantic it.

Either way, Covid certainly worse flu, we're measuring flu seasons, like 2x-4x worse?

And remains seen deaths south look like, although here's hoping nearly bad earlier on. northeast quantity testing avaliable months ago, might seeing even bigger surge paper... Time tell here's hoping nearly bad! know is, gets removed 'being political.' wealthy elites want continue making money. politicians decided ourlives worthless profits important. really simple. 'political' I'm naming politicians parties :) entire system everyone responsible. reopened jury duty/the courts live. looking forward getting called happen. need kind snarky line like get kicked voir dire without landing jail contempt... sub super toxic... Agreed, they’re outlet broken society. Good, professionals interviewer disposal force lie fired. better things do, like insist CDC recommendation.

C'mon people dying €£€€€££ insists politize situation. plan told us masks states (in KY). appalled seated 1.5 apart means nothing indoors maskless. I'd love see national mask push. Please, Dr. Fauci, please! said it’s probably community spread instead magic number. think lock eventually needed it’s better act early. case putting measures less full lock try stem tide. It’s certainly judgement call. Nobody wants shut whole economy don’t want Florida either. People still blame JIT point understand JIT. Nobody seriously arguing medical equipment companies can't forecast demand point. happened back March, that's what's happening now.  supply chain issue, product inventory management. Stop spreading misinformation. yet cases deaths world. Every country dealt except us. Apparently, checking diaper, still stewing old news instead countries done prevent spread. also talking overall trend, dropping significantly. believe going lot worse media reporting. Yes deaths many ending hospitalized seem come unknown long term effects especially 40 age group. 

The big question people health wise 50s 60s? realistically cases sparked 2-3 weeks ago. Holy shit Florida, could infected state end month. increase, practically everywhere. making joke, whatever.

And acknowledge deaths delayed heavily, yet understand man probably referring non-complete numbers?

And pardon readings incorrect, week seems higher average?

You're really making sense here. even guy incorrect, really matter much you? week clearly dip started. like said, **months** colleagues told everyone analyze numbers close reporting date. weigh heavier one sentence article? whatever, fuck actively working kill people infecting I'M one that's civil. good job cheap area make doable. Problem is, lot cheap areas good jobs. something like? would track trace work ? point allowed play ..
No one know originated..lol. EXACTLY THIS. work one hospitals listed means overwhelmed turning people away. busier normal because, like said, elective surgeries resumed. virus serious information I’m seeing come media lately largely blown proportion. Stay home can, wear mask can’t, handling things perfectly fine. Italy situation even close it. 

The numbers listed aren’t even close accurate find odd. know help completely, might worthwhile check health human services department see covered state sponsored insurance quit and/or food stamps, would cover ton current expenses perhaps making worthwhile quit pick different job leisure. 

i'm currently job covid precautions, one family high risk likely impact lot i've thought lot i'd health changed haha I've problems pubs. Ultimately believe solid education, solid opportunity, good well trained policemen without guns, great social support, pubs would less problematic. They're symptom cause. clear: two Toronto hospitals ICU Covid patients. still Toronto hospital ICUs. still worth celebrating Humber River Hospital North York General Hospital located hot zones worried them, great job. Toronto quite well considering cautiously opened stage 2 (resturants allowed outdoor eating etc), title made seem like ICU empty Covid patients, true. 6 imported 2 domestic, domestic Beijing.

Sure believe it, watching prevent efforts Beijing? Awaiting mayor's resignation speech. Words that, take responsibility actions. fucking liar wouldn’t believe anything White House approved cdc press releases 

Read article thread closely. trouble people trying spin versions truth political purposes. Agreed! concerned beaches waterparks. I've also driven many outdoor dining setups tables close together. makes wonder rules breaking. people act largely product social environments. people japan/china wear masks time cold. germans drink beer 16 yet lower rates alcohol abuse drunk driving crashes. etc etc. people largely constructs policies social cues receive authorities around them. dissimilar population sizes

That's first replied here. Please look comment replied compared USA (328 million) Canada (38 million). measures every discussion involving america also include every horror around world. all, america way damage humanity israel ever could. know, fucking losers harassing teenage girls jobs could try act like normal humans change. Pathetic. hear that. I’ve resigned fact everything reduced small fragments life. It’s entirely bad thing. things tedious, way frustrating, sometimes scary. flip side though get really savor smaller things missing. Still it’s really hard get lost head hermit up, like said.

Sit back let people fight get. years finally turn, use research know vaccine decide safe enough feel comfortable getting it. like going going injecting everyone streets force participate society. ...still waiting Trump’s taxes... *might* due new daily case numbers **triple** two weeks ago. maybe possibly. Harris County (Houston) 15k new cases last 2

Honestly think children this, really helps teach responsibility surroundings. Certainly less likely make huge mess stuck cleaning end day. many little hands make work light. smoking? Darwinism award goes I’m flying Iceland Thursday, test arrival quarantine Vietcong Taliban would like word. fair big reference labs, running peak whole time, first week received samples immediately blew TAT week. 

The thing could helped feds nationalising companies make supplies reagents sending army staff labs. can't expect feds give shit pandemic, you. know, wish taken long term view importance economy shut shit chance saving economy.

More virus automatically means bad economy. Somehow picked worst worlds. 10,000 people died yesterday Florida, show daily tally certified coded, could one two weeks. fun thought. hope so. work run people think coronavirus flu media lying. one wearing masks. way able work home lockdown put place. 

I'm pessimistic abbott able make right decision. He's weak leader. shared facilities beach like bathrooms. also can’t discount possibility least one friend carried virus. South Palm Beach County = Boca Raton, info’s sake. delete posts, account still 1 day old. nurse friend Phoenix patient cough face purpose day two ago get assholes like top hospitals overrun bed shortages.

Happy cake day ykno remember screaming point 1 heavens beaches opening everyone saying Florida would become kill two weeks. Well, spikes started occurring month beaches opened, feel vindicated see top comment. goes show popular opinion sub isn’t gospel means. said, it’s like sub completely wrong either. Yeah real keep seeing people’s social media going eat pretending everything hunky dory. It’s not, get ass back inside. Lmao people back February wrote airborne thread called doomers...😑 thanks, look DeSantis thread, maybe ask nicely? atleast netherlands, entire population vaccinated weeks. Time reopen pls What?? Reported anyone actually piss water beach? That’s it’s going take get attention average people. gets really bad, 45 throw respirators National Guard way, keep votes November, bet governor gets chastised private “keep fucking numbers down!” 

It people Florida suffer. really enforceable though. Read article. people thinking. 

“The First Amendment right don’t wear mask,″ Tollett said. “I want country back.″

I still see people refused wear mask Costco get fight manage there. seen US currently reporting LOWEST Covid death rate since another universe, news could shouting ""Covid death rate lowest point 3 months!""

When things stop improving?

Let guess ... 14 days so? He's absolutely right, I'm afraid. media telling us truth right now, wolf door! danger virus real, kill family members stop wearing mask.

This real. Get tested. test results valid media telling truth right always make sure making good informed choices yourself.

The danger real! also clear used stats current number ICU beds current *possible* number ICU beds.

Local news near tends throw slide showing ""This many normal beds use, many ICU beds use, many ICU beds exist, many normal beds converted ICU beds short matter time. Northeast did. 

It becomes easier take seriously see hit someone know. Karen's across Dallas going want speak manager kids first day school delayed. summary: know it’s gonna bad everyone’s health need money enrollment, football, basketball. Students might taken gap year defer need act like going campus learning actually change distance learning money. would call bait switch need money. people slip inevitable Maybe Florida finally turn blue?  Honestly absolutely asinine America made politics important human life.

Right? Right? I'm happy Doug Ford go route. I'm fan his, long shot, I'm ok handled pandemic Ontario. Yeah also shows growth rate compared previous week. area jumped 20% cases 12% deaths compared last week. July 3, Interfraternity Council, student-led governing board UW fraternities, reported least 117 residents living 15 fraternity houses self-reported positive tests, release said.


Frat houses social distancing holding gatherings? Shocker. also said masks much stop spread general population. That's worst propaganda coming from. Mayo says seven days frozen, 72 hrs refrigerated. profit, understaffed, worked, bad nurse patient ratio, etc, isn’t pretty commonplace country? Texas, County judges quite bit power. Yes, does. 

But much harder play idiot prevent real idiot get position. One day old account half posts literally pictures shit. Seems legit. agree 2-3 weeks probably optimistic.

I'm still going judge people following distancing protocols socially irresponsible sounds like part problem. dont know agreeing disagreeing what, thats saying dude. Denying gay couple cake infringe constitutional rights, masks NOT, health issue full stop. However, doubly frustrating type people problem business actually discriminating based gender, race, ect... seem sudden problem false notion ""their rights"" infringed, absolutely not, public health issue, masks politicized point.  Also remember deaths lag behind case spikes month more. Give trump lsd actual numbers vs percentages hospitals overflow multiple states. Maybe NY, NJ possibly MI came close? ... pardon me? whoa search diarrhea get results eating raw chicken every day, someone reaaaaaaally wants stop eating raw chicken every day wished students better national testing, mind. saying general, masks. Don’t worry, they’re probably cancelling college football year anyway Mandate law mask service chin strapping laughing snorting nose keep lying. long medical staff FL, TX, AZ start reevaluating career choices. always leave year come back. It’s logical. We’ve known outdoor transmission masks reduces spread. right protest, opening nature trails back April. Save blame matters. Checking here. bleak outlook trajectory led finally see doctor get prescribed anxiety meds. must say, Zoloft + Wellbutrin hell good combination keep apathy anxiety positivity up.

I really get mask hate Went party yesterday 4th. Let tell hands greatest thing that’s happened since New Years. Thanks. Here's unemployment usually goes recession. Look last go-around unemployment: 

 

You cannot certain find employment time reserves exhausted. Making sure stay eligible unemployment increases odds stay fed sheltered period economic recession, especially industry. ""Quitting"" job potentially jeopardizes unemployment, getting laid not. So, recommend trying get laid -- whether working something employer difficult manager ""doesn't get it"" pushing health safety workers customers. Vail weekend, building couple weeks. Really aggravating. I'm sure we'll back stay home order county week. bad US response is, like Mexico better point fearmongering unhealthy society. 

The surge new york many times magnitude Texas, Florida, Arizona facing right now, yet patient ever unable get care needed. reassuring rest country certainly see kind strain system new york did. point would considsr home schooling year suggesting media report news? Whoa buddy, crazy. watch news opinions. Thank you! figure something positive like good way pass time find employment. Stay safe! extremely misleading title OP's TL;DR also extremely misleading. two quotes crux actually saying here:

#Sweden done something important starting investigation understand strategy worked. really appreciates initiative, countries also learn from, says occasion Corona Commission presented Prime Minister Stefan Löfven earlier week.

#- appreciate Sweden openly acknowledges uncertainty strategy best combating virus. approach deserves respect.

So better TL;DR happy Sweden investigating approach, open changing strategy. 

And hey agree them, great Sweden open changing strategy. 

But Swedish media often does: twist story appear positive towards Swedish strategy actually is. disappointed SVD often late better this. 

Also reminder: Sweden remains [WHO's list risk wtf 'in network' regards healthcare (Asking canadian) Basically New England states well this. Maine Vermont bit sketch right homestate Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, Pennsylvania (though bit sketch like Maine is), New Jersey, Illinois, South Dakota, Nebraska (that one shocked me), Delaware, Maryland... etc. 
Those top head I've seeing last weeks. words states 'held down' keeping foot pedal 40+ states get shit together. sucks really want get back it. aware inmates non violent crimes drug convictions often far harsh crime committed. Using drug make addict [“All China's inactivated virus vaccine works one also work right? Technically? exactly dip absolutely meaningless America resembles Resident Evil day. Would Gluttony Class make sure next SARS virus mutation resembles franchise mentioned previously? Oh betcha will!! Hey feel bad friend. one knows going happen year even months way plan kids around unexpected events, blame kid. things pick may wishing time spend busy work. 

Hang there! oh boy hope man gas brakes foolishness. when? What’s end game?
Never open bars? Oh easy like saying massive headache. Can't think straight, etc. Oh find hard stand, etc. Next coughing, foot issues hip problems, feeling queasy, dizziness, oh chucked, etc. KNOW walked hospital looked people leisurely picnics parks like doc NY, I'd flip. credentials like word salads?

The positivity rate understand control spread; ie. know clusters are.

Successful countries 1) squashed curve 2) used test&amp;trace manage outbreak clusters. covid spreds BLM rioters loot stores ""protest"" streets? could anyone known? referenced Bill Gates sponsored University Washington model looks cases, testing, deaths, hospitalizations, ICU beds, ventilators, etc. Yes!!! This!!!! It’s unbelievable level ignorance US... Found triggered American. say American. Here's part everyone starts injecting crab blood eyeballs..... them, cause (and cause only) worth spreading disease consequently killing thousands innocent people. many Phoenix weekend. protest logic shall ban cars kill people crashes? pools lakes people drown? people retarded it’s unbelievable. also checkout recent case increases last 14 days various counties map  


Miami : 
Houston : Unless president declares state emergency across country, power make states anything it, responsibility it. state, know push county level not. think likely scenario deaths rise, dramatically April. Due better treatments. it'll longer see lag it'll take longer people die. Hmm... one day need listen. EU govts didnt wanna lock first place either. question now, waste another weeks deaths start rising. Yes. He's upfront struggles addiction.  He's preachy. happily mention date last drank.  tend like talking older guys mechanic work, construction, welding, etc. happily give expert advice like see younger people aspire get skill level. hospital still issues us one N-95 mask week, kept paper bag name use. Blatant racism. Migrants right enter claim asylum! That’s legal appropriate process. Trump winning Remember- infection numbers explode way way slow- larger explosion longer lockdown. stubbornness dramatically lengthening lockdown. They’ve many months get start faster cluster government mismanagement. I'm allergic everything one starts D! doesnt actually effective. US completely failing respond makes even largely ineffective weapon low risk high reward attack. Guarantee March orgs already updated playbook. 6 year old niece told us afraid go back school there's pandemic people could sick. said she'd feel lot better everyone wore mask, want wear one, everyone *but* wear one...6 year old logic. watched China bring case Vietnam May, China claimed cases low. fact China still local cases, tough contain China shown. Yeah we're super close. Hoping fall better us. then, we'll keep lol. Cheers, man! mention happily risked killing communities high north without access many hospitals... might I'm Sámi, still say Swedish government got away lucky. I'm really thinking Ohio way new hot spot.   


I really get either, DeWine one proactive governors beginning opened everything quickly, mask mandate. Russian bot world war z shit Mmmm, ativan... Can't already done monitoring sevage water? Great work. Good luck career. Keep enthusiasm creativity you’ll well. people **largely** constructs policies social cues receive authorities around them.

""Largely"" operative word here, otherwise prisons. Seriously, people act like animals, probably treated like over. 

No idea people cool sick. trashy know someone lives area hasn’t stopped socializing. It’s surprise happening she’s common case Jesus man. Really bringing Florida vibes out. I’m fighting belief, don’t care believe lol - stating reality think we’re losing track discussion. Maybe they'll end paying wall
after all... Thank heavens Roblox, Fortnite, Google Hangouts, preferably time. That's middle schooler maintaining social life. like sitting around friends, looking talking them, play video games. two people less 2 meters instance spreads virus, period. It’s basic information it’s true studied. That’s need know know must causing uptick. way, water wet sun hot... 60+ year olds contribute great deal economy demand side. Restaurants run thin margins is; older customers loved ones disappear half year, go under. Better one month zero customers 6 months 70% customers. Btw, lemme know murder charges officially pressed show court give fuck. SARS-CoV-2 left spread unmitigated perfect storm first-world healthcare system. sad see demonstrated empirically again. hope people get smart politicians re-instate NPIs. Even they've got weeks rising cases ahead them. sad. brains highly biased. many cognitive biases: anchoring (rely first information told discount rest), groupthink, belief bias, confirmation bias (recognizing data supports one's belief), availability heuristic (overestimate data available them, like ""my neighbor party get sick""), overconfidence (probably worst one all), many many ones....
We full biases, many reasons people choose avoid risky behaviors. What's traveling nurse exactly, go place place better pay? basically Stupidity algorithm figure who's truly dumbest all? We've needed also makes think Winter Soldier Project Insight... news Michigan - college football teams still sucks Congrats inventing first time machine... New Jersey outdoor limit 500 people.  cost prohibitive. understand need drive moving family whole point this. Nobody saying masks bit inconvenient, needed prevent large numbers unnecessary deaths. stand issue depends value human life compared value convenience. someone explain Sweden's deaths approaching zero without lockdowns/masks/other measures? I'm waiting see far goes everything gets shut again.  Oof. Caught affluenza again. Everyone likes point Japan like failed state stable population. Japan visited clean, safe advanced. US could become like Japan many ways would embrace it. No, think will. should. keep trying downplay covid posts idk even here. feel bad malls. ways accomplish safe retail malls - restrict number shoppers set tables large shared areas. Risk function height ceiling volume air - multi million dollar HVAC upgrades dying industry virus due gone year fair. Big Cuomo fan mistake. Hah! course smdh....how embarrassing.... everyone USA self entitled sacks shyt......So sorry Canada. 

You right thing charging them.   March don’t link handy.  basically said wearing mask harm good people would touch face much putting taking mask complicated non-health care professionals figure out. surgeon general one said masks don’t provide protection need save HC workers anyway. Later shifted “protecting supply chain” argument Fauci admitted congressional testimony last month downplayed efficacy masks inadequate supply PPE. 

Whether aware them, things true also RW media ecosphere. want reach people message must address problems directly. F' complain it. That's right, like everyone says right wear mask.  Sanctions follow least convincing answer I've heard. vulnerable people dead? Quite unlikely. fat country many old. vulnerabilities disappearing 120000+ deaths. joke worse.

Seriously...do get comedy constructed? recognize famous Joker quote? places country control, like entirety northeast, countries around world OH WAIT hard deny American culture much individualistic certain cultures. Uhhhhh fucking left IVGID month ago Californians crossing state line drink NV bars, even private beaches supposed closed everyone IVGID residents letting tourists apparently they’re letting stamp card holders enter (which often included short term rentals neighborhood). one post office (which doesn’t deliver entire neighborhood PO Boxes) two local supermarkets... actually left LA least LA get shit delivered people taking seriously. 


When Lake Tahoe finally gets broader community spread — it’s bound happen — it’s going hit very, hard. NY cases already higher others kind correct entirely. Look ""Nasal-Swab Testing Misses Patients Low SARS-CoV-2 Viral Loads"" Basically nasal test works ok lot virus airway, fails detect much pick up. Contrary popular belief, amount virus (viral load) correlated whether symptomatic, know correlated infectious are. wish focus. keep pushing death toll, beyond clear point people simply care. America desensitized large numbers. another 100,000 people? Nothing probably. may increased testing capacity buy % positives go up. well could states similar track Florida southern states spiking week hit 10k two weeks, there's easy 100k. know til get though. want think unlikely behavior I'm seeing support opinion. Absolutely. couldn’t said better myself. 

15 years ago, assholes internet everywhere went, didn’t run rampant wasn’t culture people learning from. Now, fast forward 15 years younger people much unfettered access internet via phones, tablets, laptops, etc. Anyone sign anonymous, free social media account create many different ones want nefarious purposes, act like someone else, skirt ban bad behavior. little accountability risk acting like asshole, much bashing, trolling, outright inappropriate behavior everywhere essentially normalized, young people joining participating today grow thinking acceptable normal online behavior. Source? month ago, someone know : one TV set died; took 10 days decided new one get, shipped; put up....

so 10 days - TV got news good ole newspaper.

he happened call up; shocked different News - (he sadly Fox TV person).

I told brainwashed Fox, happy learned TV 10 days; get news ""real"" sources like reuters, AP, BBC, NYT, NPR, etc etc.

He seemed ""ok"" weeks; guess allure Fox TV strong cause he's back Trump loving, no-mask-wearing fool. It’s actually COVID, they’re hiding it, surely can’t outdo NY deaths. lie endanger civilians L.ibs. Canadian here. rule applies Canadians re-entering Canada well. Mandatory self-isolation 14 days. also applies Canadians travelling provinces, whether briefly left province, returning home, visiting another province. 

I sure American couple even managed cross border considering currently closed essential trade goods, reunite family members. can’t prevent people traveling definitely quarantine people, like Hawaii I’m Korean. one internet heavy countries world; use much social media countries more. 

Social media garbage well, way less people spreading believing bullshit stories covid. Rogan real idiot, period watch AFL. Naming names figures usually gets mine removed. Trying changing capitals start names &amp; replacing letter front. Hoping get banned next. words white american woman. New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan figured safely states decent. solution would take seating areas, close play area, limit food court takeout, etc whole course requiring masks encouraging distancing. would encourage people get get business. tell hardly spend time mall common areas unless I’m food court. Otherwise I’m hitting stores came visit. better prepared ways. Nursing homes complete disaster let happen again. Also, country taking seriously, wearing masks, social distancing aware. hand, cases. Maybe Apr. 30,000 cases day different Today. Instead losing 2,000 people may lose 500. Using ratio would need 120,000 new cases day 2,000 deaths. think math way think best cut death rate half. Question is, many cases day death rate catch up. want guess feel total DISASTER. worried know going do. Bill never graduated college medical degree arrogance Americans, knowing country experiencing overwhelming COVID spikes *still* choose travel another country ignore COVID-19 protocols gives America bad name. behalf two dingbats, apologize, Canadian, friends. understand support individual rights. it’s worth, think society better freer people are; however, there’s line clearly drawn comes rights—the duty right creates. US citizens right free speech, duty stifle others. US citizens right bear arms, duty safely use maintain arms.

When comes masks, anti-mask group states right enjoyment life right tell government pound sand. they’re missing fact everyone else also right safety security person. wearing mask shop store means someone putting others risk—shoppers, workers, extended family—then obviously going unmasked putting others risk. Plain simple, rights anti-mask crowd supersede rights others. want talk individual rights, that? never left Canada...? wife works COVID ICU first death COVID pt nurse ED hospital. can't stressed enough. Obamacare employer plan gets hit massive bills like this. 

If employer self insured third party administration, single employee trigger stop loss insurance. increased claims stop-loss increases drive rates insurance, requiring employer increase employee deductions cover. 

Scary think what's going happen next year. Utah at-will employment state, there's good chance getting job back Joe Rogan funny either. misogynist POS everyone Instagram feed looking chart:

""yeah, I'll please."" Someone home town flew Lake Tahoe yesterday four kids. catches brings back beyond pissed. Like lot small towns dominant senior population super vulnerable. 
This guy wealthy course feels invulnerable. Losing one seasoned healthcare worker cripple department. Several co workers sick. People care really wear mental fortitude. talk locals, would change mind. live Canada never happy live till now..almost 12,000 day insane. hope people USA start taking seriously. I’ve wanting get membership personal trainer it’s crystal clear pandemic isn’t going anywhere, invested small home gym. blows mind people filling gyms everything going on! ones town (medium-small city Texas) packed parking lots empty spaces left park. fuck people thinking?

It’s conspiracy theory, it’s 100% fact Mormons notable exception that. grew church prepping basically part religious doctrine. There's strong undercurrent culture needing ready society fall apart moment. sarcastic? Or.... Corpus Christi, Texas here. cases seriously rise suspect tourists played part that. closed parks, cancelled events, banned traffic beaches, worry deterring July 4th tourists. (I'm going right can't say crowds bad today not) page number 2010 study mentions COVID-19? America. Germany state media one main points outrage crazies also believe covid hoax Bill Gates Jewish controlled satanist. deserve everything that's happening thought flu? Uninformed people yes. specifically talking about. Shut fuck Gates. dentist Poe’s Law strikes I've posts removed. linking article dense visited AZ &amp; spoke pucey. dare political! Unfortunately, believe catch sooner later. People dont wear mask, dont take seriously. Time time again, ignorance apathy see daily bases frustrates end! mot holding breath vaccine. Good luck you, fight morons spread facts country cases steadily climbing either people lazing SD measures/masks went holiday nearby country Europe risk Americans international pariahs based selfiah ignorance dirtstain Donny  Soft paywall would guess shit. give idiots stage voice opinion, matter big stage is, people going listen. another white woman losing damn mind. Easier enforce quarantine island. within continental US impossible. Way many roads enough manpower shut monitor it.  Canada straight executed care  dad went law school there. Spreads easily less deadly. Idk abt I'll take that. Everyone's going get eventually rule applies anyone entering Canada.

I'm sure there's exclusions workers general must self isolate 14 days.  using court system contact trace, serious problem this. think 25% Americans infected COVID? Wow 2.4x highest pretty far apart, seems like numbers lead charts Africa.  hardly breathe ngl I'd die beliefs, including earth round went moon he’s expert get Bill get asked wear *mask* talking inform fans virus, 

but nah, thought flu. 

what talking about. Case Study easy. every government planet dealing issues. USA come last (and really even close).  effective. Business travelers going lie much paper trail, example, plane ticket x date, business meeting date, multiple people involved report violations. worth risk. company wants send somebody Phoenix AZ, Houston TX Chicago able it. looks like palpatine here. Love it!
   
 ""Are completely mad?!""

 ""Yes,maybe. we're anyway."" Ugh! annoying cus got tax refund know I'm system! Ok, everything truly epic! Mr. Reaper, sir, proud American... seriously thank service :) Maybe, man want test subject. Looking available studies, I'm opinion droplets mainly expelled mouth speech, quote study says speaking produce almost much droplets coughing, another says increase dramatically volume: 

I ok people sticking noses outdoors silent. think putting masks mouth protect people, putting nose protect yourself, allowed decide whether comfort worth it. It’s opening. Disney playing chicken government hoping tell delay opening instead themselves. emerge ashes like phoenix? Sure, also move Latin America say Europe Australia. 
And born USA, situations like would seriously make consider moving abroad. Good job, Ontario. Honestly, careful me. I've really careful. things I'm worried about. know teachers underlying conditions. know answer is. It’s easy get around though. Fly another city first. coming city aren’t required quarantine. Could also cheaper flight since non stop. mutation around since February. It’s known D614G mutation slammed Italy Spain earlier year, also likely present NY went hell. 

No, isn’t new like OP commenter I’m really starting suspect reason it’s pushed “new mutation” current administration play round 2 “Who could seen coming”. Enough enough, research shit stopped played failure narratives He's part problem.  could vanishing anything else. Nah, you’re wrong. I’m far anti-vax get, I’m skeptical. questions brand new untested vaccine crazy. get flu shot every year always date vaccinations, please don’t try. BRAND NEW disease. ask questions look research doesn’t make anti-vax. Someone lonely. hope guy. Get reddit go get sunshine Sorry 77 thousand new cases come ppl Dumb jocks. sympathy. Idiot millionaire children. Yup. us right thing staying home! 

The middle pandemic right time go sight-seeing! Chicago going challenged court. Enough said.

While think good idea quite infirm legal ground real world. Wat wülldsde?! really really scary wearing masks hospital creepy uncle amiright? ever called Trump? Like I've seen headlines disagreeing trump ever blamed Trump things Trump definitely responsible for? Lol I’d say grandparents would terrible excuse lol Listen fuckwit. Indian want listen carefully. nation state crisis, Prime Minister team scientist trying best solve crisis. ICMR stated strict guidelines followed, remember India Indians stupid. vaccine safety issues, causes severe complications, know cause catacalysmic havoc nation. insult PM nation. feel good vaccine, take it. Many said before, say again. Two words:

Natural selection. Look picture people ""tubing"" river here. screwed. Sister, vigilant isolation, due pregnancies &amp; young kids family throwing bbq today! hell people thinking???! Let's say 1 million working right (doubtful) would .07% death rate mistake, assume people give shit new rules. know, Murica thinking

Assume worst, wont wrong. Yep. Either nothing ""they're counting every death COVID death."" No, doesn’t help. Well, yeah. tried give y’all warning, don’t listen warning Canada, yes, face law  make things right community since push economy early contributed mess we’re now? True. would still say high risk. True, one Near, inside mall.. walk in, already paid, pick go. mask on. right here, arguing way worse eat inside, can't imagine building without mask He’s directly blame. I'm Trump fan, two genetic variations, gonna go specifics, research. variation g variation actually subscribed NYT $1/wk deal articles maintain much higher standards usually see nowadays. lot research geography class, much human element found NYT NPR. Research papers, good reason, generally neglect aspect. Exactly, remember said can't spread human human argued stopping international flights? mean? **Reddit deliberately promoted conspiracy theories** wanted smear Trump.

CNN: Well fair people actually *want* immigrate USA coming much worse situations. Look murder rates Latin American cities. Makes Chicago look safe comparison. Alabama! lol *barn owl It’s true. Northern Va highly educated. wonder correlation? Tired takeout styrofoam, poor substitute hot plate food.

It's easier convenient eat styrofoam; I've found think lot higher meal enjoy take styrofoam stage one plates. lost heat way restaurant home, there's shame throwing microwave short time bring heat back up.

Yeah, work clean; *really* ups meal experience makes feel less depressing. 700 Healthcare workers died four months. 

Think that. I'm happy school work even playing around idea in-person fall. parents complaining, whole ""I pay much private school want everything way!"" schpiel, just. No. get they're teenagers online classes sucks, we're missing socialization. worth kids getting sick. Good. Follow rules pay fine. much thought that. I’ve nurse eleven years majority career ICU ED. extreme minority nurses anti vaccination usually well respected usually scoffed at. nurse practitioner met single provider anti vaccination. lol ppl guessed going happen re-openings started May right lol. I, keeps getting worse worse. I'm seeing mask, that's good sign though. I've gotten takeout Smithfield's twice, that's it. Seems like grocery stores keeping food demands better, still toilet paper local food lion. Honestly, miss slightest. I'm damn good cook, cooking relaxes me. Also, I've never given food poisoning, there's that. Twice much 58,000 Americans died Vietnam War, practically guaranteed hit triple weeks. used 3,000 dead 9/11 many. 40 times lost Coronavirus many people even care. guess Americans allowed destroy Americans. reached peak internet could, know, advice people take supplements. choose supplement, call. FDA alternatives LAL now, including recombinant protein Lonza know lol, playing part cocky dumb American can’t read good Dude, need seem help. mental health issues real doctor help with. Please stop taking medical advice Donald Trump. TBH, think UK locked way late much effect all. Even major city see people sorts pretty lax lazy pandemic, especially lately. feel constantly gaslit social distancing really limiting errands essentials get one place/run. Meanwhile people seem constantly meeting people outside household going Starbucks every day. always wildly dangerous many times need risk exposure? get it. even masks foolproof. coworker survived Covid ICU. It’s two months since he’s back gets horrible migraines can’t work hours time can’t walk stairs. He’s barely 50 doctors can’t find way control migraines don’t know long gets better. find super concerning wish statistics. Random Vox whatever saying anything considered relevant official CDC guidance. Obviously people listen travesty opinion trumps evidence.

I recall ever seeing anything claiming belief covid racist surprised fools saying that. like, saw news coming China. bunch horse sh\*t. wish stupid fucking family decided go like artificial beach TODAY planning go someone else's house tomorrow. Arizona started partial second lockdown last week. Really closures bars, gyms, things. gyms refusing shut down.

To answer, think mid-late July July 4 numbers in. It'll pretty strict re-open least month ahead election. Here's done far.

Reported ""no clear evidence covid 19 could spread people"" January.

Waited March declare pandemic.

Repeatedly making false statements masks. Masks necessary, masks work, masks medical personnels, wear masks symptomatic.

Their latest tweet mask says mask necessary exercising.There allegedly 2 kids China died exercising masks.

And expert said asymptomatic people rarely contagious. clarify statement later, could shut mouth talk masks.

My country's health ministry claims follow guides bans outdoor seatings restaurants. policy makers recommending people dine indoor enclosed spaces. 

When people say 5G conspiracy nuts idiots, least multiple PhDs scientists ranks.


Who needs they've done far regards covid-19 results numbers today? 

Is anything they've done far shows they're effective organisation world desperately needs now? Hep sammiches, Hep C contracted usually shooting dirty needles. Lol, one chiming thread already deleted mods 9 hours fact, totally-not-bothered-man-baaaaaaaaaaby. Came say exactly this. Maybe hope it’ll stop even fraction people coming Chicago. read something said there’s rule, 50% people follow it, even others say there’s way enforce. cut travel half hotspot states (or 50% isn’t accurate considering traveling right now, even cut 15%), you’re better off. think true mask mandates. masks get on, better, even can’t get 100%. maybe asymptotically approach US population rest eternity, never going Time ensure medical professionals supplies, suppose. idea. Ya, Americans entitled people history planet. change people close die. Maybe even then. Even one August 15, it’s still 10 weeks mass produce distribute.

Not mention half Americans even want it. Also, opening schools even though super careful expose fuck entire community. strain around since February, it’s exactly new seems hot ticket item right now. strain ravaged Italy, Spain parts Europe. 

It doesn’t game over, need people stop acting like idiots actually respect safety guidelines there. 26 year old? Holy shit. I’m impressed you’re patience. second pulled Trump said thing tests means cases, would’ve done They'll regret get permanent kidney and/or lung damage. stroke. brain damage. lifelong blood pressure issues.

Did cover all? Wow. work colleagues there. thought controlled Sounds like guessing. Masks would stop what's coming implemented universally, leaders turned political position. 

We could stopped this.

We still could.

We arent going to. Without medical treatment, case-fatality-rate (CFR) seems 5%. lower rates see news political announcements, based assumption ideal medical treatment.

When medical facilities full, new patients get medical treatment, CFR about, 5%.

That panic. 

Before then, prepared protect family. Social media merely tool.

The fault lies directly species misuse technology. Underrated comment  comment point brought control quickly, schools may even open time.  case know, provinces Canada covid-free. However free movement provinces moment. thoughts also. people even want live USA anymore? Well Steven king nailed it, stand. Go home, America. drunk. some... innovative policy decisions.

Banning cigarettes particularly retarded considering smokers fuck lungs, they're also much less likely catch virus first place studies shown (probably nicotine also binds ACE2 receptors, thus blocking them). policy leaves smokers worse spot before. yesterday realize parking much easier apartment complex. bunch people left, bunch people left lost jobs lost home. contract ending August I'm little afraid they're gonna hike prices make roughly twentieth complex gone.

 kicker is, live CO, many cases Gotta pump numbers America Holy fuck dense. testing = documented cases. mean *actual* infections increasing. ICU cases deaths declining two months proves *actual* infections going down. Hopefully. Lawless usa better racists arresting people drug procession communal this? skeptical vaccine, say clearly. argument opinion Prime Minister adds nothing significance argument presented! Someone fragile. Los Angeles lost people COVID New York 9/11- reason anyone cares one death placed cops unearned pedestal I'm society- use leverage get people take virus seriously im going take it- even makes sensitive people like clutch Pearls Hilarious 😂😂 RemindMe! 10 days even locked down, 4th july weekend... Buckle buckaroo. start. /r/PandemicPlaylist suggestions. fucking hate nicotine. Keep trying quit. Went Black Milds HS Cigs Dip cigs dip ecigs nicotine gum Nicotine Pouches.

I going try quit COVID better. chance it'll help protect I'll keep using pouches. Also really want go nicotine withdrawals right lol Posts like ease mind bit  Fantastic!! there's people complaining beaches open today source Trump recommending demonstrating mask use? Compare much costs stay home wear mask. point data? would interested. seem like wishful thinking went outside got sunburned. I'm again. Fuck Chinese version, somebish shit now!

How virus get worse?

People calling since Memorial Day... Fucking duh, Internet I'm counting either. place dumb enough test would parts USA. New York going transition ""lock-out"" anyone outside state forbidden- infection rates going start major clusters every metropolitan area country 2 weeks. Yea take away dangers covid close healthy Yes. Thats actually exactly u/whereami1928 said. Virtually nothing else reliable subject less human error. stats agree, assume less accurate.  work one want go anymore  mask mandate still 50/50 people wearing masks. Stores enforcing fear shot beaten crazy Karen. even seen worker scrubs wearing mask store. definitely going still shit show mask wearing already going back area up. Also people going go 4th. believe can't live fear extremely smart cautious happening Texas. Social media definitely problem, one example. can’t believe we’ve gotta point America many people actually anti cop. shit goes south, people gonna call? fucking ghostbusters? That's like Trump haters bashing Americans head they're American. 

The CCP responsible party mess. May bike. symptoms neurological mostly, symptoms encephalitis, still electric vertigo move around random headaches, chronic fatigue insane. Same. Helps I've got acre started garden started want snack step back door grab bell pepper something. Yes, deaths flat cases go up. FYI food delivery regional. Amazon pantry delivers... takes awhile.

I'm potato. ok. Polity send home. said less deadly? Wha... brain hurts reading sentence... Yeah, Costco workers get paid well here, too. friend department manager makes around $80k colourful beaver dollars, plus full benefits. Huge step grocery/retail jobs. 

Our minimum wage around $7.40 20 years ago, got bumped $14 per hour $11.60 3 years ago. area, 2 bedroom rental $1800-$2200 per month, average home $430,000, well play difference wages. also income tax, HST (harmonized sales tax, bit federal government, bit provincial government), 13% tax goods services, pay infrastructure health care. Honestly, problem paying $1.13 $1 purchase go debt I'm ill. 

You mentioned 'national minimum'. country minimum, state minimum potentially higher? hope rest accompanied eye. Wear mask reduce risk spreading others. It’s huge touchy subject you’re 100% right. I’m saying did, it’s absolutely plausible thing escaped lab...it’s plausible jumping organically animal human. 

Here’s scientific research paper coronaviruses studied Wuhan lab *originally published 2015*. even says things article like particular strand studying made public, would impossible predict absolutely people spend 2+hours Walmart. idea why, do. LUNGS FUCKED ASS FLAT!

GG!

,,l,,(-_-),,l,, mean.. fever days you’re good  good job keeping retirement homes though :( Something like half deaths there. Credo quia absurdum est. Earlier today saw photo Dr. Fauci hands flat face mask. noticed people medical field better people medical field comes touching face masks.

I trained years ago touch hands face I'm asthma even cold cause serious problem me. keeping hands away face washing hands soon come house standard practice years. Knowing simple cold wrecked life three months, upped steps take damn well taking every precaution think reasonable. (Reasonable I'm worried may step virus. touch bottom shoes soles feet face.) He's good platforms good people. never take word anything... Ultimately fun people. dopamine rush subversive aggravating someone respect (Liberals.) Consequences damned trolls itching fix. New World Record! We're best! Dude ain't going anywhere least next year. Totally thing /s LOL, they're hiding deaths. cases younger people, they've protected nursing homes, new treatment protocols. never said cautious. saying need keep things perspective Yeah, making make horrible investment decisions. swear People US fucking stupid, talking social media course. Twitter shithole can’t really take anymore, wish could go back 2016 enjoyable scroll through, it’s dogshit  way others try confect groupthink weak links re-inforces idea covid-19 comes Putin. like Trump ""election"". Thanks! tried zooming in? see regions / läns.

For Norway able get data. counties, municipalities boroughs (for Oslo Bergen). one site Denmark around 100 municipalities / kommuner. 

For Sweden situation complicated, since various regions different websites. amount data varies also. true.

Are DC Comics Superman? Incline looks like shit show right now. blame leaving.  virus happy. Right? idea OP put like that, 4 months Downy Fresh! 100 mill  5 weeks 795K? buy it. buy all. me, bother antibody test, test negative, could mean never Covid enough antibodies test pick up. tested positive, could mean Covid seasonal corona-virus (common cold) test picked wrong antibody, prevalence pretty low everywhere January latter significantly likely. Maybe point cell testing check functional immunity available outside research settings yet. Antibody testing guesswork way down.

Flu shots typically 30%-40% effective preventing flu usually help relieve severity symptoms rest, possible happened done neither. Imagine cracked heat exchangers replace winter. Adults time learn basic critical thinking skills. Sometimes there's enough time day, lack patience, deal not. absolutely astonishing see incredibly fucking dumb humans are.

Like, fuck one become stupid? take common sense toss window taking obvious bullshit gospel without even second thinking ""wait second...""

These people literally want think simultaneously spouting people need ""think"" ""do research"". living oxymorons. go FB now, pretty much groups joined. deleted anyone overzealous politics. lot quieter saner I'm still ready delete whole thing too. American find strange Chinese people accept government thrown million Uighurs concentration camps country. guess countries governments bad countrymen good either. Thank lol smh That's virtually impossible. might breaking lot laws / rules rush vaccine.

A vaccine requires lot tests / researchs. There's simply way happens fast.  rate infection slowed significantly reopening, people wore masks. yeah thanks trump GOP ...you pigs 

because didnt supplies needed stay safe protected lives...

**YOU PIGS!!** read, clear cut. may able done ethically. certainly possible fully inform volunteers known unknown risks. 

The virus infected small minority population countries, still going substantial delay waiting trial participants get infected, hundreds thousands millions could die. That’s real fine, one people might actually pay attention confirmed : total 13,091

Meanwhile, US verge breaking 60K new cases one day. good news? sorry go that... better now? really great long term effects. know theres lot people apprecite work nurse-me included. hero many people's eyes.  Schaub's son sick? suffers seizures, right? mean Schaub saying CBD oil sells cured son seizures but... don’t pledge allegiance school (and never schools I’ve to).

I'm college pandemic taken huge toll grades mental health.

Today 116th day I've spent inside. live family parents really making things easy, also brother battling cleaning hygiene OCD since last year, makes coexistence extremely difficult.

I really think talk someone feel, preferably mental health professional.

And really like idea first resources, call anyone talk what's troubling you. say alone, I'm sure there's lot people would love talk you, feel like need social interaction, call grandma, uncle, one cousins tell friends gather one evening via Discord. That's working relatively well. (s1)FILTHY LYING HUMANS 'BLAME'

If blame means find source ... well (s1)

If means punish ones responsible DONE 200k enough dead  Blame gonna help cept KNOW we're came ... got .... ????

If means ELECTING NEW LEADER ; better DONE father tested last Thursday still heard back, he's Broward (Ft.

Trump would defunded turned golf channel shit Gotta get enrollment numbers deposits rolling abruptly cancel plans move full-online. 

A lot schools frankly bait switch this, parents want pay SIXTY GRAND YEAR tuition kids take classes online (and also gone ""great"" college, lot professors would GARBAGE trying teach online - tenured old farts many departments really hunger keep distance learning techniques likely bother trying good job. least teachers know onset they're online educators develop toolkit minimum competence same. Yep. Health population something somewhat, testing big thing.

With people US want act like over...imagine quit testing? Yes virus would still there...but news wouldnt stats. get it. great position years, don’t down. shall pass potential vaccines, better odds finding workable vaccine. certainly good news. That’s right happens one left intubate you? That’s people need responsible.  Yeah, true, even Canada, without trying mean judgemental, lot overweight nurses.

Myrtle Beach seeding states left right since reopened. actual beach - coastal beach towns built plenty entertainment options ripe spreading COVID. karma example World assumption.

I’m sure completely believes smoking issue fired. He’s absolutely terrible liar, hahaha Yo right huh lmfao feel broken, like nobody cares. ICU nurse, I’ve taken care COVID patients. People fight wearing masks, think everyone’s overreacting ICU fighting life. soul feels broken. feel like nobody cares people want, put people love risk, run us healthcare workers ragged. Strange became epidemiologists months

That's main result ignorance: arrogant attitudes. country full people like that. OK. called heros. RIP. coworker’s dad (early 50s) worked long term care facility contracted corona virus. ICU ventilator 3 months even testing negative lungs function enough own. finally passed away believe 2 months ventilator, conscious perhaps last two weeks.

There horrible people want right bad they’ll claim people die complications virus didn’t actually die virus order somehow validate delusion virus isn’t big deal taken seriously. don’t know. court didn’t overturn Hawaii. comment supposed generalization perspective. Coming states, many people die stupitidy others. always owe source, otherwise facts matter. Please cite sources. R, left right - want say something, prepared back source. Even then, think opening much premature could make situation infection much worse. Today saw plenty packed patios people groups, barely 6 feet apart groups, plus hordes people hanging parks public places. 

Sure, likelihood transmission much less outdoors, mean crowd outside invincible Her: I've tested negative three times. antibodies too.

 Ok, say 80% wore masks...even 50%.


That's still way better less 10% wearing masks getting drunk. massive protests/riots dying down, coronavirus fears rage again. Rates highest they've ever been, virus obviously weakened. 3000 deaths/day 100-200 deaths/day. understand reason conspiracies. talking about?

I'm even white lol You’re right, doesn’t spread easily outdoors, especially there’s breeze like usually beach. staying family groups 6 feet apart low risk. clusters found far protests thankfully due outside many people wearing masks. stopped early elementary years (1995ishhh). Yes didnt know government would absolutely fail them, help get needed equipment keep safe also allow public spread virus please completely overcrowding hospitals I've met shitty doctors besides reading Fox News Breitbart esting wonderbread mayonnaise sandwiches, specific source imagination made believe hospital procedures defined political opinions Donald Trump? Thank that, I've thinking doctor office Tuesday, want discuss first (he helping stay hospital sick). I've taking low dose aspirin ever since realized covid (I think covid like 11 days taken many precautions get it, know Mom's friend covid lesions lungs like week ago). 

My friend MS said symptoms much like first lesions appeared. would best provided data/journalism really scary want homeschool idea even start! 

If comfortable telling state, help figure out. Florida, homeschooling streamlined simple, thank heavens. researched homeschooling several states help can. exact experience - ruling scary reasons, ruled out, settled ""your shit painfully inflamed?"" offered naproxen sodium script (which, brought mega bottle Costco generic Aleve appt show taking manage, write script shit i'm already taking??)

but WASNT healing months Icing, resting, stretching, etc. hurt bad frankly disappointed DIDNT find sort impingement tumor, least would plan action RESOLVING pain.

I decided try vit. supplementation research deciding safe try hurt matter actually going on. cannot recommend enough. Vitamin deficiency makes feel around crummy ""run down"" way many us attribute stress modern living. never realized feeling worse needed all. the. time.

Good luck! hope feel better! medical schools pass fail pre clinical years. honestly good thing though. p number would make important? Agreed. article probably worth reading, remember is: Anecdotes Twitter. could lying, assume still know rate random sampling people recovered. top that, doctors verifying symptoms. ex nurse let's say exactly compassionate “Pathogens spread number ways” 

Lmao figured, nothing say even register. I’m wasting time trying prove anything you’re going come back nonsense. You’re exactly type sad times.

Please research. want actual science, go friend. take everyone wore mask would effective, hella cheaper super hella faster. THAT'S KILLING EVERYONE MORON! Two months vilifying entire LEO profession

To fair, profession villified itself. natural outcome lawless law enforcers obedience, contempt. mean like 90% county? Got it. Essentially Farrs curve. People looking entire US instead looking areas. evidence sure seems true you.

LOL Intuition one alternative. suspect others. would say 85-90% nurses work going happy hour, bars, friends. meet happy hour come work take care immunocompromised kids. It’s mind boggling. Weird. something could put mouths nose would help stop transmission airborne virus. Anyone got ideas? question whether Fox News Facebook brain damage. it. let guys anymore already have. going sued lose. local college dorms COVID lease policy now. get money back classes go online only. course college less 1000 dorm rooms.

We've done carryout times. area SE Michigan people quite good masks, though last time picked pizza single worker shop mask on. Really blew mind. Delayed. prevented. Wow, astroturfers really come force one, haven’t they?

The genetic evidence doesn’t support idea outbreak started Wuhan wet market. It’s likely started small outbreak Southern China went unnoticed. COVID won’t killer medics professionals. Likely health problems suicides linked stress.

The government absolutely failed US. long glass Crown Royal, I'm right you, friend! Exclude whatever shit talking about. Sometimes. time. anecdotes everything, really important rate things occurring validity data. 

This article indeed worth reading remember end anecdotes Twitter. Wilson?! US one expensive health care systems world. pretty standard level care, many people go bankrupt chose die costs would destroy lives. understatement exaggeration. insert brazil, russia india list   texas EMT here...I tested positive 1st.
pretty surreal experience, almost feel like cannon fodder... like poor guys front boat normandy, troops general WW I. feel like shit, like pins needles over. like long drawn flu... sucks. fair, different Muslim countries suspicious non-Muslim vaccines. 

Are Western vaccines haram tested pigs? Dictatorship ? Lol. know hell talking about. Gotta Dutch back home Carolinas definitely ""my nurses"", wrong all. Shocking hear, I'm sure. Highest case count day NY 12-13K, pretty limited testing capacity, know testing much should. difficult get accurate numbers March/April, hard compare FL now. Duh? United States 👏 Haha plans men cop? ""only"" indeed. Healthcare costs thousands, government sure wants true!! kept telling March/April...

""This nothing compared go Walking Dead!""

""At least COVID dead staying dead""

LOL sister's idiot boyfriend said mutual friend works with, HVAC biggest customers restaurants,

""I'm wearing mask anymore. see people restaurant wearing one, I'll wear it, not, I'm not. I'm beyond virus bs. Besides, already think it, fuck it.""

This idiot thinks fucking joke. anti vax start questions exists, unless one scientists developing Thank you! keep telling dr nurses give hope! done course ( protect others). think people don’t realize implications “the hospital full” think well still get treated get hurt.... nope. Dude child actually think that, happens everywhere world tests last saturday, doubling. Probably mistake mine sorry, lots third world countries universal health care! makes countries doctors better than, say, Denmark’s, didn’t recommend masks general public?

What country it? responded wrong profile:

Again ad hominems assumptions. great!

Lol arguement? Take bubble, stop listening mainstream media narrative, research help wake up.

Have great night! suspect gentleman I'm referring previous post Fox news viewer decides turn news TV. work IT, focused around federal government. lot work keeping track what's going different federal agencies like, part daily work cadence search news specific agencies online. I'm sure despite Fox news viewing habit, exposed variety different print news subjects. He's smart guy, take type skip something source. read something regardless source, simply interests him. maybe that's part difference attitude towards virus? IDK. “Every year 9/11, would go looking magazine say, ’Look, it’s again,” said Jessica Rashes, Cooper’s 27-year-old daughter. “He would bring family barbecues, parties, anywhere could show Susan Gould, longtime friend, said Cooper proud photo, purchasing multiple copies Time handing “like calling card.” said Cooper shrank copy photo, laminated it, kept wallet.

That's kinda messed up.   students live campus commute classes would far greater opportunity. went quarantine week early movies watched. Multiple people came covid office last week. Yes! kroger used someone sanitizing carts, it’s self service (and always wipes/spray) *Coronavirus likes this* Feel sorry Lake Tahoe residents.. could Next hot spot💯 need make memorial them. irony finest. Advice accumulated ones lifetime. ever given advice people outside field study? really hope virus else time quarantine comes PTO I'll pay visit.

what fuck bars restaurants?

It's local (county-level) decision definitely idea statistics. closed indoors outdoors dining 2+ months though. (take only). stabilize new cases 2000/day statewide (the result actually non-uniform: metros brought cases &lt;10/day, others (LosAngeles) kept isnt spike cases amount testing?

I think jump testing recently, definitely enormous growth since hospital admissions 

going death rate?

unclear yet, (death rate lagging new cases 2 weeks), given ICU admissions going up, deaths follow

case/death stats: stats: result positive, coworker might already recovered recieve result...🤷🏻‍♂️ Actually, mask problem city. think honestly church back yard BBQs biggest issue. happens never get viable vaccine? social distance/mask forever? give develop natural herd immunity? forget movie opens showing young stoner promising candidate med school despite chronic underachievement. wear shirt, pants, shoes go grocery shopping? constitution say need wear clothing public? Oh wait, doesn't. highly doubt would want come Canada. still getting hundreds local cases day right next disaster zone kill us destroy country hope (America) gets virus control, local governments able catch cluster infections balloon bigger outbreaks. Fighting mass hysteria caused media, corporations, government officials. FTFY Keep closed 6 months. Still seems surprising 700 healthcare worker deaths US considering million physicians US many exposed disease much, much average person. healthcare workers bring number 2 million would similar fatality rate general public (granted I’d imagine average age lower) son actually sick tho, said many times, also claim CBD oil sells cured son, incivile? haha Straight facts Yep, one signed - especially without public support. got call yesterday doctor quit due concerns covid see could move physical next year different physician. can’t blame her, really miss her, I’m sure instances impact practices/hospitals. Bianca Ambrosia reported. work for? many hospitals area. endangering patients, coworkers, etc. Idk trying pull ""Gotcha"" specifically saying ""anything like wearing mask bitches?"", here's compilation thoughts whole found quick search, know fact more. *""In Arizona, nearly half coronavirus cases people 20 44 years old.

I think irresponsible sad, really taught. borrowed future showed care welfare (i.e. environmental destruction skyrocketing deficits). guess end day reap sow. Portugal point. 

Not UK. fucking retarded?  Whats “may” stuff. need 240 experts? No... please... wake dildo. Social media fault. Stupid selfish people are, poor government response. Yea I'll definitely take rushed vaccine india, sign up?  yes totally support american Japan actually quite different Sweden. closed borders ( ), worn masks even pandemic ( ) somewhat halfhearted lockdowns ( ) 


They also population generally follows government guidelines health system comparable best world. lot recent anger Shinzo Abe's response virus though - especially 'abeno masks' spent ridiculous sum money masks, 2 per family, many still arrived. 


I think Sweden Japan really compare recommendation mobile version alternative way? minutes spare hardcore troll I'm going fuck alternative likely diagnosis

Let's walk this, seriously seem confused little point.

Someone shows hospital. (Pick two): Fever, chills, rigors, myalgia, headache, sore throat, new olfactory taste disorder(s)

OR

Severe respiratory illness least one following: ""Clinical radiographic evidence pneumonia"" ""Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)""

**AND**

*No alternative likely diagnosis*

That's big right there, get right?

The information think educated **readily** available consumption, rather live bubble world simple makes sense you.

You wrote: ""This different tuberculosis kills 1.5 million year yet media makes sound much 2018, total 9,025 TB cases reported United States

Your doctor either idiot, lying, CDC apart grand conspiracy figuring own.

The reality is, know killing people lost people covid already. directly impacted life ways beyond pathetic level comprehension. fail reach understanding terrified little individual afraid face reality pathetic existence could threatened something simple pandemic.

People dying dude. Left fucking right. flu, diseases every single fucking day pathetic little individuals like mock others courage mock sheep reality is, fucking coward can't seem face truth. rather bury head lie fabricate grand conspiracy media world get fits *your narrative* world.

It's pathetic. pathetic. Ignorant honestly, worst kind American could possibly have. represent nothing. nothing. encourage fellow Floridians. motivated enough is. :-/ Gang gang nothing surprises anymore IOC said Olympics fine .... watching horror consternation... horror thing direct linked pandemic toilet paper panic buying. really worried potential grocery shortage bought lot water March U see pic 3 cops grinning mocking death elijah mcclain? Sending pics officer. laugh celebrate death unarmed black kid u dont get people anti cop? remember vividly sean bell died. remember officer volpe broke broom stick half shoved Abner louima asshole officer volpe told Drs abner participating gay sex. partners covered him. lot good cops definitely understand many anti cop people Beaches main draw. beaches closed, people may necessarily stay home, certainly distributed, thus reducing probability infection. Honestly feels like living apartment meth lab. saw lot people wearing masks half tied basically little apron hanging loosely faces getting blown around wind Same. live streaming today spam attacked troll randomly posted “all lives matter” started calling bunch names threatening doxx me, find live, screenshot post pictures every alt right website find...I’m like, bro...I’m sitting petting dog talking bought accessories. want relax? Lol ....

Why think they've stressed washing hands go bathroom?

(Which something people anyway, apparently people gross) Yep two-week people wrong, early. Norway universal health care starting 1920. Pretty much every one else got 40s, stragglers 70s. govt owned 1% entitled exploit us way wish, limits, including torturing us death making health care costly lot people. lol fucking hypocrisy. smithfield evil company even sold responded first place. Compared zombie apocalypse, nuclear winter, catastrophic climate change, horror movie level disasters... correct. 150k dead right now, economic strife right now, *nothing* compared sort disasters appear movies, likes researchers studying.

That say lives important loss tragic. trying understand people trouble coping find common thread horror movies would why. fair young man raised household doctors constantly exposed medical knowledge, even motivation lacking. hate part says he's loop watch news. seems kind weird practiced talking point among pro-Trump anti-science set.

They'll start argument give kinds fake misleading statistics, Ben Shapiro's arguments memorized, say, ""but fact?"" suddenly they're like, ""Oh, pay attention politics.""

And like, ""Oh, sorry, paying attention. Could tell that?"" like, ""Oh, wasting time bringing up. know anything it, want know anything it, pay attention politics."" though paying attention politics achievement point pride.

But drag gem they're cornered facts like, asked back assertion made.

I've multiple conversations different Trump supporters basically work like this:

Friend: libtards sacrificing freedom make wear mask. proven virus less dangerous flu. Three times many people die flu every year died COVID-19 far. 100k deaths Chinese virus, 500,000 Americans died flu last year.

Me: What? getting information from?

Friend: I'm smart pay attention what's going on.

Me: Well... quick google search says 130k people died COVID-19 last months (and number still growing), source estimates 24,000-62,000 flu deaths last year's flu season.

Friend: Oh, sorry, I'm obsessed news politics like are. mean, maybe right, that's I've heard. So... know.


And like someone trained argue way. really weird, actually. mean feel like I'm living movie I'm one survivors rest people exactly people die dumb shit. point, allow safe entry people Brazil come UK. think depends work. worked small rural hospitals unfortunately anti-vax views among nurses far prevalent be. friend mine works one rural hospital Christian Conservative community, says half nurses believe vaccines. would sad didn’t secretly, deep down, sorta feel way. common sense answer would be, people hypertension and/or heart disease prone catch complications due Covid (that's fact already know). Therefore, dying sooner Covid complications due co-morbidity heart attack/stroke own.

So straight admit probably vivid related conspiracy linked two liberal news organizations can't say ""Duuuuuhhh that's right-wing news org"".


Way complete condescending cunt. Get absolutely fucked asshole. Fuck Bill. *holds breath* selflessness, talent, absolutely brilliant people lost span 3 months. May rest peace knowing real heroes unforgettable time human history right. Part droplet precautions eye cover. health care workers initially wore masks. also studies show mortality rate depends somewhat exposure amount. airborne though, N95 higher completely protect getting respiratory tract. American who's sheltering home since FEBRUARY, I'm sorry many countrymen hellbent making every wrong decision possible, aggressively possible. deserve better neighbor. curiosity, many died fighting flu? Throw disasters Florida!  Isnt weird like 99% arent doctors nurses emts ? conspiracy ?🤔 Joe Rogan said kills sick old people. Canada's COVID rates go up.

Based what? ignorant racist assumption people Beijing still infected going travel Canada?

China scared domestic cases anything else. tested 3 million people Beijing, would unlocked believe safe so. Probably arent getting fucked first place. googled found it’s finalized 2018. Also found article misleading comparisons spread probably referring to. Considering fat seem be, doubt good grasp medical training anyway. I'll never understand someone health industry straight obese. Like lung cancer specialist chain smokes. Yeah dude. adults think critically enough need suck opinions dick whatever comedian commentator follow.

I’m proud American /s hospital eight days really bad gallstones gallstone-induced acute pancreatitis billed $130,000. even ICU private room! Now, insurance, 'only' pay $6,500. still.

I got billed multiple ultrasounds MRI trying figure going innards. thousands each. think room like $5k day. Every medication charged. Oxygen charged. stop every 2-3 hours check take vitals charged. Multiple doctors day would pop talk minute two charged $500 visit: surgeon, respiratory doctor, GI doctor, think one two others. gallbladder removal cost money. ERCP try break gallstones blocking pancreas putting biliary stent cost money. hugely long list charges, came one one course like ten months, nightmare. I'm MI governor done good job, great deal pressure. may loose business lockdowns, certainly blame it. hate gets from....ah, certain people, completely misguided. don’t think it’s odd can’t find anything directly saying “we don’t recommend people wear masks?” 

It’s never said that. Exactly explained links you’ve provided now, didn’t make affirmative recommendation wearing masks public health concerns—like people failing stay home social distance think wearing mask solves problems, people hoarding masks contributing PPE shortages—which different recommending people don’t wear masks. 

The never recommended people don’t wear masks. Neither CDC. experts made painfully clear get-go hold-back masks public health concerns, none experts recommending people don’t wear masks. 

It’s okay admit uninformed non-expert opinion wrong. experts remarkably accurate jump stuff extremely transparent reasons weren’t affirmatively recommending universal mask usage. attempts undermine discredit experts alt-right talking points. totally understand wouldn’t want admit duped buying misinformation you’ve made aware it’s take responsibility stop spreading misinformation position experts taking masks. highly visible voluble portion us, following rules hard. Californian here. suspected bad, even worse imagined. Thanks writing this. can't stop co-workers going out, least vocal risks listen. Woo “healthcare” magic. Look excess deaths: peak expect aren’t counted COVID Me, too. People look mortality rate miss huge part picture. Even 3 6 weeks would devastating lot us, that's fairly probable outcome. Long-term disability less likely, likely death.

The worse something is, harder empathize, think. ...haven't descended cannibalism, yet! Alternative punchline: ""Captain""

(Referring military's supposedly lax standards health professionals.) they're killing economy. short term stimulus bring worth perpetuating pandemic. saying would personally comfortable losing source income. Losing house. Losing car. really awful thats real situation occurring here. 

I think mostly agree, government absolutley provide UBI adequate help thats simply happening right now. government failed contain it, failed provide adequate support many, many people. 

The gym owner responsibility community, includes employees he's keeping payroll. system live in. 
It's hard perfect idealist make 'correct' moral decision decision could quite literally ruin life, national crisis less. 

I'd also like note virus kill everyone. lethal, already killed many, fatal, world-ending super-virus wiping humans. Idaho currently less 100 deaths. We're talking currently exploding states here. public health crisis, state local regulations provide guidelines can't ask someone bear burden assistance provided. ways mitigate risk much HVAC best practices. responsibility lies much customers govt. Officials here. saying wrong, so? 

Pandemics happen healthcare workers know ones frontlines.  Nah, lack education critical thinking. countries social media well. US suffering simply average low. He's still great many people's eyes. guy told research he's great president secured borders (with money congress approved DoD), lowest unemployment rate time (from economy inherited) brought jobs back US (if look data, negligible overall job market growth). Yeah. He's great* president. seriously doubt there's going another round stay home orders.

How numbers worse worst case scenarios? Deaths still trending flat? 💯 Please get CT head. found encephalomalacia thought evidence stroke. MRI showed new lesions brain. Please take care ❤️

Georgia make easy FIND information need, find it, pretty straightforward. I'll link below. 

Basically, 1. pick homeschool curriculum(s), 2. submit intent homeschool, 3. make big binder student fill ""proof."" proofs get back regular school ready. Georgia, ""prove"" kids worked 4.5 hours day 180 days per calendar year. prove 5 subjects: math, science, social studies, reading, language arts. 

So, proof, make weekly calendar print child. fill things like, ""Week October 11th. Math: Multiplication practice. Science: Habitats frogs. Social Studies: Ocean explorers. Reading: Books ocean explorers. Language arts: Writing frog habitats."" write books, frogs, etc. Keep worksheets do, etc, big binders. use websites help you, write too. So, example, Georgia, would use free Khan Academy curriculum math reading/language arts, I'd sure write binder lesson did. 

Here link. hope info gets started!  grown adults stupid lazy take one guys opinion one knowing force guide life people need take good hard look mirror start making decisions.

No, came lab already destroyed samples. type fantasy world living someone going starting pandemic help reverse 6 months in? unlikely thing anyone proposed virus.

Plus, lab already published methods. full genome. shit ton experience making SARS-like vaccines 2004 (like avoiding N-protein avoid ADE). literally created vaccine within 24 hours getting genome.

I'm simply basing judgments think say. bothersome, spark urge spout off-topic cliches (because, again, I've explicitly told I'm taking virus seriously are! yet...you can't stop, whether they're relevant not.) Lolllllll smart one arent ya. dumb. world's best vaccine developers breaking records still needs year.

Thank work. I’m sure does. Here’s this. county health officials seem think differently. guess masks effective entire protests Washington cases (total bullshit) shouldn’t need social distancing. think it’s asinine believe somehow protests aren’t spreading covid.

I can't believe ['why herd immunity BAD overview 2 months old now. sadly proving precsient:

Even post-infection immunity functions well possible, many die may end disabled / long term sequelae. SARS survivors often suffered quite severely life following illness. go google scholar type ‘SARS sequelae’ long list problems. watch [this video following three young, previously healthy SARS survivors whose lives ruined]( impactful. Many experts think could happen least severe cases COVID [“I think long-term sequelae,” said Yale cardiologist Dr. Joseph Brennan, using medical term disease’s downstream effects.“I don’t know real,” cautioned. “But disease overwhelming” recovered likely face ongoing health concerns, said.](http://archive.vn/eo6MA).

As I've saying late: looking like ""herd immunity"" end ""herd disability"". :( Disgusting there's many people can't stand little inconvenience protect lives good people. Even disgusting leadership concerned le stonks protecting people, given that's entire fucking job description. Maybe they're going homes outside Beijing itself. heard pretty common country home there. they're angry people forcing face denial? together accurate. pandemics years long, contagious, asymptomatic period. key spread disease. addition, pandemics killed host quickly, unlike pandemic.

Would things different Obama Bush? Really hard say. seriously noticed this. NP OBGYN's office told paleo diet would (not might) *cure* fibromyalgia reduce pelvic pain. month spite myself. lost lot weight, help fibromyalgia gynecological issues. Shocker.

I multiple friends attended high school nurses. trust 1 them. rest zero scientific background scare diets, old wives tales, general woo believe. gone grocery store? Deaths low

* testing catching cases earlier 

* Looks like younger cohort catching it, least (that's one big question, spread young partiers older folks)

* better treatment options three months ago (no miracle cures, I've read couple things saving lives then)

Also, looks like maybe [fatalities started although hard say based days Yeah, seen overall death numbers would bet similar trends over, real differences much country undercounted. I’m Syracuse. I've noticed well. Believe me, remember people could smoke desk people smoked. kind funny prohibiting smoking workplace begat ""smoke break."" sure, used head smoking buddy get fresh air clear head. think nicotine really relieves stress smokers, understand perceive way.

Canada's COVID rates go up. nurse Canada got COVID 19 working covid positive long term care home. got exposed like three weeks ago. whole experience made feel like expendable replaced anytime. Luckily long term effects virus, really want go back work. worst thing getting virus exposing fiance. Yeah. Even though deathly sick time still drove hospital freaking afford ambulance!

It's funny, really bad shape parked ER parking lot. across internal road 100 yards ER doors, since people arrive sick hurt best shape, golf cart drive people lot ER itself, even though far.

Probably figuring he'd call help passed out. Tom Hanks great movie. IMPORTANT: answers post outdated. Make sure review current research!! 


The material must melt (including microstructures inside), electrostatic properties must kept tact (don't coat anything chemicals heat enough loses charge), structure must lost (will impact fit), things like elastic degrade. 


I think would safe maintain mask something like 150 deg F moist heat least hour (achievable expensive pressure cookers without pressure), set aside dry location least 3 days. Track hours worn, ""safe by..."" date, number disinfection cycles. Retired certain value. 


I personally used UV-C disinfection N95 masks, must able determine proper dose least wildly underestimate time required....or end causing fall apart due material degradation. Well, blame stupid people.

But... also blame social media giving stupid people voice heard stupid people retweeted stupid followers stupid person retweeted fucking are. 

It almost feels like orchestrated order us give freedom speech. We're shown actually dangerous thing let everyone say whatever want. Honestly also reinforced poor leadership. Countries/cities better leadership better. 

We 4 months mess looks like we'll rebound least 1 month ago places. So, still, 3 months away go flat again, lower risk contagion, idiots confuse ""freedoms"" ""rights"" public safety right media made clear mask wearing part left's plan control people.

sounds like Avengers quote, damn Would apt show minimum wage workers herded COVID cars. Yet evidence thus far shows taking responsibility, it’s basically recipe failure understaffing, smoking also one ways actually get break. someone acting arrogant, sure conflating two pretty basic concepts.

They saying graduating high school important grand scheme things. saying understand senior year big deal *to high school senior*.

You're smart, demonstrate compassion parent weird time children going thru.

Now time dunk everyone graduates high school. know that. That's like laughing teen child first breakup, ""nobody marries high school sweetheart"". Sure, that's mostly true, invalidate feelings having, that's shitty parenting. People dont seem understand quarantine save doctors lives too. Even think selfishly. thats 700 people save life need them. worked 5 days week know work 7, thats 5 days x 52 weeks = 260 days year. see 8 patients day, still modest estimate, thats 2080 patients year. multiply 700 get 1.4 million patients per year. Thats loss may life saving service 1.4 million patients year. Asthmatic here. It’s great you’re everything improve chances, keep up. 

Initially, covid typically manifested respiratory disease, asthma listed one primary risk factors. Later understood virus operates, became apparent asthma wasn’t one major risk factors covid becoming critical/deadly, however clearly extra complication wouldn’t want get covid. FYI, high blood pressure probably biggest factor covid disables enzyme body uses naturally lower blood pressure. 

I remember paying attention Idris Elba early example asthmatic got covid, relief recovered without asthma complications. However, may slightly better shape me. -_-

That said, fear getting covid still freaks out, everyone, keep everything prevent reduce risks best can. something like 10 hearings house 4 dead Benghazi attack. 131 brave Americans confirmed dead article! Total post 130,147 dead US, dead wars. fucking accountability that. It’s worst case scenario 80% (approximate herd immunity level) US population infected, vaccine effective treatment. 4% mortality. hope create national monument dedicated people lost lives fighting modern version war over. altruism rare nature. It’s bad evolutionary strategy that’s easy game said, still deserve us everything keep safe. way kid stocking shelves grocery store, woman ringing out, everyone else deal public days does. really care personal compliance is. fact, take huge risks disease occupation, maybe that's see point careful occasionally personal life. Either way, still obligation.

Excellent point thank making going Beijing #2 Hongcouver Lag time seems increasing mortality rates decreasing.

That according data UK, Israel Italy least.

We're pandemic occurring unknown virus see impact. can't give date. nothing beach dangerous. hell, *encouraged* people go beach entertainment mind something relatively low risk.

but absolutely right......the public restrooms worrisome, along indoor seating restaurants. places outdoor seating though.  brother. faith. already put work. 

i like imagine pandemic curve leads runway. right we’re coming around corner start see light end tunnel.

at beginning completely dark didn’t know going on, thankfully smartest people word working this. real nurse even immunity would want model responsible behaviour others lead example. soo obvious why, states seeing influx, however, extremely hard state without utmost derogatory towards states general population. i’m sorry thought u said relief businesses? governement isn’t giving tax breaks? refunds? grants? stuff like that? definitely changed bit goes loss smell anything else too. definitely say I've lost it. stuff actually tasting better tbh. can't even smell weed, SOMETHINGS lol. Thanks kind words tho, much appreciated People UK love take dump us Americans.

Our country isn’t terrible. bad leadership right now. It’s great time us, fact, it’s nightmare right now. But, trying survive get see side. I'm pretty sure pink color industry-wide standard indicate P100 level filtration. Hope like sweaty gym shorts face asshole.

^(Parent commenter ) [^(delete message hide sad. RIP I'm disappointed say think lying nurse.

I live next hospital; building primarily hospital employees, elderly people frequently use hospital resources, like.

There exceptions, included. I've seen enough people scrubs taking masks leave hospital know, firsthand, nurses concerned modeling responsible behavior.

I think sometimes status nurses gives inappropriate level confidence understanding science medicine.

For example, I'm friendly nurse floor also happens sell use essential oils. Politely could, questioned homeopathic cures, ""Well, science know *everything*"" sort response.

And get religion, great deal nurses religious, sort literal way seen surgeons be. (Of course, anecdotal!)

I guess conclusion think nurses informed medicine science cops law: They're awfully confident, sometimes little shocking little actually know. There’s still one grocery store. read articles terms death rate completely non-Covid related ailments rising compared previous years.

And others posted, one high risk category, visit doctor's office puts one risk. picture doctors visited know one could safely navigate without risk - waiting rooms tiny; elevators terms aerosolized air increasingly shown problematic even one elevator; many medical buildings valet parking - one take public transportation even Uber presents somewhat risk. routinely genuine adverse reactions vaccine understandable get really good example us safely receive vaccine receiving it, including Flu vaccine. RemindMe! 14 days  Well that's bad news current amount active cases definitely gonna sustained. may early June levels infection months...possibly get vaccine. don’t know people keep talking potential widespread second lockdowns. won’t any. United States decided go full Sweden. Lockdowns happen state state locally that’s it. Remember Dr. Fauci said wear masks? It’s interesting know nurses checklist questions they’re supposed ask patients? Well one gotten flu shot year said no, planning . that’s made statement. never asked opinion matter feel like probably told couple patients thought them. first last time saw doctors office wonder someone made complaint that’s isn’t anymore Remind Me! 14 days I'm Florida I'm kind surprised many people neighborhood lighting fireworks tonight. seems like normal, maybe city cancelled annual fireworks show (thank god), maybe I'm anxious hyperaware. seems so.... apocalyptic. much virus spreading right now, neighborhood, everyone partying? Aside that, anyone proud American right now? shit hole country.  Thank taking care us. forgotten.  
  
We'll never forgive fucking piece shit Trump, refused take Coronavirus seriously. overlook contact contamination issue

It definitely risk, see huge risk. again, exposed risks shopping food getting takeout. Given virus spreading US, opinion sooner later get it. see point taking necessary precautions delay moment spread around get it, see point completely isolating hiding home disinfectants next year two. Except BLM right? Hahaha. Outside supposed bad. guess we'll know weeks. Indeed. That’s absolutely done won’t. least full blown lockdown. Things going get ugly least sort breakthrough medically. I’m sure blanket policy here. Maybe individual employers could enforce that. OBX one best places vacation right hang beach house people came allowed enter first place? 60k people die every year flu dont compare 9/11 wars. completely dishonest comparison.
    
12,000-61,0000.    
You forgot part statistics.    worst case scenario. using facts willing face risks. virus proven 99%+ survival rate people even visit hospital gets virus. Pretty much risk would flu. mask circle jerk going anything unless arguing wear rest life. initial infections, definitely. combo multiple outbreaks year year lack medical infrastructure cause problems. Initial infections almost always mild subsequent infections different strain cause severe dengue. years ago think 300 deaths Paraguay. past years Central America hit hard probably 400 deaths Honduras alone. like COVID, deaths need worry about. people need hospitalization. overwhelm system.

In Guatemala daily Covid stats used come reminder dengue control bottom. taken pretty seriously really gum thing up. yeah, idk west nile relevant really don’t understand hard possibly people kind respectful patrons people don’t say make rules it’s huge problem don’t go take business somewhere else oh great another asshole feels like rebelling virus sorry. terrible story it. Who? Seriously never heard person probably tell conditions farms, packaging, shipping, retail establishments then.

Let's say immune system goddamn *superhero*. Even COVID-19 can't *usually* get one past (it's better infectious microbes).  talked about?? That’s sure. “Here kids eat vitamin don’t go near wine..(I guess?).” national mandate wear masks point weak minded illiterate reality show host running country. honestly tired ignorant racist self absorbed people incites... running mouths saying absolutely nothing intelligent. First, Treatment getting much better. Instead treating virus strictly lung pneumonia related immediate ventilation intubating. realized experience autopsies, Micro clotting lungs organs much bigger certainly initial problem/ treating blood thinners, steroids severe cases remedisver, using prone position fight pneumonia low oxygen stats. necessary, intubate. working, word steroids alone cutting deaths 30%. Second, lot older population protecting better average age hospitalization dropping hotspots. Listen imbecile, comment mention anything supporting vaccine completely. I'm saying trust medical institution nation. enough proofs evidences I'll stack take vaccine. I'll take word sovereignty nation. countries don’t use Twitter. Grow up. That's cope. accept consequences. ""OK Doomers"" Oh well wonderful news. Im happy people Cambodia certainly need academically ""gifted"" doctor. need reasonably intelligent, importantly, dedicated getting good grades whatever hard work entails. feel people US put much weight innate ability, enough hard work &amp; grit. 

I agree process weed lot people. post daily updates reason, savour asspain.

It's fine salt vinegar flavour.  low number compared countries. makes low-risk country. risk level perfect. Brits, example, allowed travel much riskier countries without quarantine get back home. Thais allowing people 3 4 countries low risk gets. forget closely monitored. ariving traveling Thailand. countries actual leaders part pandemic. I’m 100% this. It’s undeniable experience it. 
Also, test negative, doctors aren’t looking symptoms complications like, heart issues. It’s funny actually chose nothing like cabbage, things would’ve probably gone better people start learn. instead, choosing actively steer people opposite direction tell people coronavirus fake it’ll go away. 🤦‍♂️ interesting conversation piece doesn’t take team researchers conclude ppl familiarized w relevant material adept handling said material hahaha Didn’t know politics involved hot dog brand buy. enjoy damn hot dog. even employ teenagers?

However, value test somewhat disputed— insignificant number false negatives false positives occur, don’t really know *means* immunity perspective. Wtf Half optimistic correct math around 3% population died WWI Spanish Flu? fuck wrong government California? preventable deaths fucking tragic. RIP heroes. I'm weeping. o7 TIL parachute use really different superstition traditional medicine.  bet slouch get free bowl soup. Looks good though...  understand statistics this. seems selecting several hundred people recovered covid without hospitalization, giving comprehensive checkups testing, would give everyone idea much damage covid doing. 

On hand, maybe that's *why* nobody done this, avoid panic. Doesn’t matter easy clean doesn’t actually work. Air flows, aerosols waft. Anyhow, cloth civilian mask chucked regular laundry. People need learn wear masks correctly stop touching them. RDH school would expelled pulling mask clinic. quickly learned leave frack alone.

America’s imperialistic history magically start 2016. Dissolve toxic unhealthy legacy narrative. Think critically.

... seriously took 239 experts confirm this? Population * estimated 75% infected reach herd immunity * Infection Fatality Rate

320,000,000 * 0.75 * 0.01 = 2,400,000

If reached number quickly (within year two) would also incur many deaths overwhelmed hospitals, lack medical treatments, economic hardships suicides. ""surfaces main mode transmission"" theory hold water see super dense countries much lower case/death counts.

The say surfaces main mode transmission. getting idea from? Maybe also medical staff trained take care severe cases. mean lockdowns worldwide well: get time get know virus manage it. Damn,that's really sad,here got 2 doctors got covid passed heart attacks, cancer, car wrecks, accidental falls, gunshots, number things likely kill covid. I'm done doom gloom bullshit. falsified numbers day one multiple doctors government representatives admitted it. comes deaths going down...its wait two weeks yall saying month. 

They lost shuttered small business allowed protests allowed rioters looters burn shit authorities watched. Good luck ever getting control now. shit show least month. happen?

It sounds like got story movie. Masks social distancing still help prevent. saying minimum time distance considered risk might need increased.  Again, article *not* lower infection death rate better job detecting mild cases.

Japan 5% case fatality rate (not infection fatality).  *higher* US slightly higher smack bang average world wide. proportion detected cases, Japan's death rate barely average, certainly it.

This article low level spread low level total deaths whole population Japan. Nothing death rate per confirmed case per true infection. lord helps help themselves... health care medication bro. idea talking about. “Masks hoax.” Really? people believe anything! There’s telling many positive cases coming weeks expect daily total get lot higher. shit. I'm shocked carelessness people city showing going lives nothing happened.

Instead, policymakers (and health experts involved policymaking) West ended assuming best case proven reality much much worse. mega corps wanted everything reopened immediately, spread mass propaganda Covid 19 Liberal hoax. Also masks American unchristian. P100 N99 N95 Hi Brandon. venture 1x every two weeks (Maybe week toddlers drank milk - 1 person store only) grocery. trips enlightening, pass plaza, road heading mall it’s packed people. least US, got vaccine. ""anti vax"" movement really small despite media attention; overwhelming majority Americans got MMR babies. I'm actually little surprised wait army get it... Moderna's vaccine. feeling either Astra-Zeneca Pfizer one get widely used. melting means it’s working! Type Canada search bar.

Mobility proxy shutdown. tracks much people’s mobile phones move, plots time plus minus baseline mobility average. call dad this. He’s truck driver decent job wearing mask groceries shit wants go climb trees cut dead limbs I’m like “uh maybe next year bed available ER”. 

Like time risky shit. waiting game who's next? kids...? Total opposite Gavin Newsom California. way revered early lockdown response, idiot protestors called mean names, gave let everything reopen. I’ve known many people hid (20+, NJ). Three died, rest recovered fully without lingering symptoms. It’s black/white. hope information posts comment help bit. never quit job backup family owns construction business I'm going back work time being

Sounds like pretty big fucking back downvoted ton (so I) .the protests absolutely made large portion population either think pandemic made think political beginning media etc kind reinforced conspiracy already starting believe. sad thing horror new imagining conscience likely greater horror actually reality. yet, deaths declining. Weird... Im glad death rate plummeted. Hope keeps Ahhh wonder news channel watches. good article inconvenient findings “lock everything costs” party.

In epidemiology different metrics account many years life lost. Covid likely taking actual lives (primarily preying elderly) issues killing younger population almost certainly are... wonder YLL would compare two sets deaths.

Seems like worthwhile study / analysis least. Gimme second stimulus check baby Yup, I’m outside Austin far that’s district planning far. 😬 live St Pete right Tyrone Mall. get pet food today cat you’re exactly right, there’s sign pandemic here. legit saw family go golf cart play baseball park TRUMP TRAIN flag masks insight Fair enough Lmfao Congrats Toronto... I’m sorry Americans please don’t come (unless winning follow fucking rules) Pretty pointless discussion ask me. vaccine yet, even know ever vaccine. Let's see. Time quit. add in, people lost jobs therefore insurance. yes plenty people still purposely avoiding ERs, doctors, etc even really need seen. really 18.73%. FL-DOH pads daily report extra negative numbers (found nowhere else) way brings % positive down. Yeah. want throw shade upper respiratory issue yet *still* hear voices, remind people, relatively close friend one case, who've gotten virus nice, nearly asymptomatic way.

But hear ""the US losing battle COVID-19""...I'm pretty sure that's they're talking about. people waiting months seek treatment, COVID... 

Then COVID still cause. would designate safe? going trust word roles would designate safe. also believe period time needed create designation yourself. period time? wait year vaccine made public use? opening pubs directly retarded stage yet  even misleading title one. Swedish media often does: twist story appear positive towards Swedish strategy actually is. disappointed SVD often late better this. 



 Reposting comment additions here: 

These two quotes crux actually saying here:

#Sweden done something important starting investigation understand strategy worked. really appreciates initiative, countries also learn from, says occasion Corona Commission presented Prime Minister Stefan Löfven earlier week.

#- appreciate Sweden openly acknowledges uncertainty strategy best combating virus. approach deserves respect.

So TL;DR happy Sweden investigating approach, open changing strategy. 

And hey agree them, *great* Sweden open changing strategy. fact, despite praise goes far along crux issue, really good development imo: reminds much treated Denmark changed strategies testing needing hospitalization testing widely. lots effusive praise mixed among ""you really know better better, dammit"" core message. may indicate Sweden's swing herd immunity towards Test, Trace, Isolate set stone. 


Also reminder: Sweden remains [WHO's list risk Anyone tearing shit up? fuck... that's crazy. guess makes sense. hope vaccine works distribute around ASAP. privatized healthcare system, impossible justify purchasing large quantities ppe pandemic “may may happen “.

Well, happened. Yeah everyone take dump ocean? grocery stores businesses need negative pressure air systems going happen businesses think long haul expect 15 year old parent, that’s issue. expect 15 year old help younger siblings, that’s called family. 

They shouldn’t give sports, clubs, hobbies, education may day pick sibling school forego night help sick sibling. 

It’s ironic thread helping fellow Americans wearing masks taking precautions, it’s anathema people would expect family operate family. Maybe that’s ethnocentric view. I’m Latino culture it’s expected family help family. geopolitical ramifications matter anymore, yes, know happens falls back America. partner came fever yesterday can't get tested week! Migrants don’t spread disease, saw CNN. 

Why people town afraid migrants? people dying usual don’t know why, could possibly people afraid and/or poor go doctor? local state government run shitbags lie time stay office. Oh National office too. shitbags around! think exact opposite. mainly burned part population exposed prone infection. Cab drivers, bus drivers, hospital staff on. might part explaination. 1,7 million 70+ citizens Sweden. 4800 people aged 70 died, thats 0,3% group. 

Its known spread uneven population Im looking Stockholm mostly. Suburbs dominated low income cramped living huge outbreaks, well parts Stockholm virtually infection free apart cases caring homes. 

People many daily close contacts virus lower spread average person. 1% chance die still 1% chance die. follow logic, Ontario grade 9 students clean classroom sweeping /mopping floor vacuum it. throw away class garage etc. going take guess actually happening Ontario.

Covid's like HPV 2020 cities ICUs hang around 80%, (at least nyc) covid happened, elective non-emergency surgeries stopped happening space could freed up. really bad Tampa matter swing it. like top doctor US realizing he's replaced someone, three undoubtedly completely unqualified position. We'd wind Jared Kushner podium telling us everything fine there's nothing worry rather one doctor trying get much information possible public realizing he's fired truthful he'll replaced total yes man. link going know it’s rushed not? That's ideal scenario. one time California crazy rules like can't walk beach fish? WTF? bad can't left common sense? Want go chill maybe swim? Good. Want massive beach BBQ / vball competition hundreds people gathering? Fuck you. That’s first. Turns bleach melts adhesives food packaging. Lol. New York = 1,657 dead per 1m

Florida = 177 dead per 1m

I figure FL catch NY about....two weeks Lol calling people sheep pandemic. Huuurrr duuur. option. He's graduated college lease expire. ruled air travel risky. yet even conservative outlet (NY Daily Post) reporting Koch-sponsored research acknowledges actually little link BLM protests virus unsurprising, since protesters (not enough, *most*) masked up. right! American universities bigger small town without residents i.e. students, town-within-a-city concept implode. Fleeing pandemic direct risk life isn’t justification seeking asylum? It'll interesting see statistics stack current reports see many deaths reported pneumonia organ failure year. Take look rest developed world. happened too, pre-pandemic. least city. I’m saying add context, notice article doesn’t say anything COVID cases cause. That's goal, good old Boris busy denying borders exist. *cries Texan* OSU (and universities near Columbus, like Capital) completely dishonest corrupt even cat starting come bag. Particularly ""undecided"" freshmen sophomores (of always decent amount), see lead fraud lawsuits learners moving cheaper online options local technical community colleges offering effectively basic ""gen ed"" courses fraction cost. deliver pizzas definitely parties average weekend many thought would be. Still good, could worse. Thankfully closed beaches stop Florida Man  Hey, sure read part correctly, Corpus Christi actually Nueces County. Hidalgo, Cameron, Starr closer Mexican border. Asymptomatic-transmission. everything I've seen far, outdoor seems okay, indoor seems like big yikes. That's political determination. breathed sigh relief Trump's last two events outside, plus upcoming one NH. Beer gardens worry nearly much indoor bars. Beaches seem safer churches. True... it’s small percent morons. Stay course don’t lose faith. get everyone know get VOTE.  OP clearly meant say city. gonna make wear one?? Nope nobody else going to.. wear stupid ducking thing want sheep others actually done research know stupid virus dumb fucking leftist redditor , highly touted midget says?? also ducked aids epidemic nahhhhh wear bulls hit ima continue past 6 months issues .... fuck cry baby’s live Collin County. Hill dickhead, feel like one first stop letting people know amount cases county. every day Nextdoor would post cases started mount just.... stopped. im already tired second wave called Idiot Mountain  Hate sound ignorant tell I'm really surprised considering culture treats certain people like dirt guiltfree. Tomorrow U.S reaching 3 mio. total cases mark. 
Three millions Covid19 cases one country, still lot people take serious und make jokes it. Well said. death rate gonna start jumping hospitals hit capacity next month so. true. Talk Brits Brexit Germans. Every country full idiots. nothing K-12 schools cant done better via computer countless homeschool programs demonstrated 10 years. need live teachers involved all. yes proven better every level student including slower faster ones. need internet connection many completely downloadable/offline.


I suspect actually Universities. Hahaha muh ""US third world country!"".

US well no, make sure never get bad close down!!! everything! lakes, parks, restaurants etc... wear damn masks!! really worried personally could definitely see people reporting it. time goes may forced get better people report wearing mask. whole thing matter common sense. don’t need know much understand sicknesses spread nothing done prevent them. 

Of course Florida going explosion cases, inevitable. don’t get people surprised going on. Sunday Times article, bunch nuts! Hopefully pick Mar-a-Lago cheap wash hands touching bags eat possible transmit way.


Thanks playing, kid. Enjoy rest night.

Oh, even bother replying.

I read it. 😂 Agreed. 100%.  Yup. hospitals eventually reach breaking point keep hitting exceeding numbers. Universities know it’s bad idea. wait long possible make things virtual/on-line classes tuition checks cleared. Oh man right near bars. don’t need bulletproof, virus proof. dude moron.

1) getting viruses like millions years major cities, globilization, wet markets millions years. completely recent change environment viruses bacteria thrive on. 

2) Oxygen important fight cancer...? even mean? see reports masks decreasing oxygen saturation blood, heck talking about? damage bad. long foundations still strong, rebuild place. become peoples aliens universe. Lol. White middle aged women. Expect catch COVID.

You're traveling county highest amount positives state highest rate daily new cases.  numbers daily infections 2 weeks going truly bonkers, hospitalizations 3 going extremely depressing. Abbott’s order, went effect noon Friday...

_High Noon_ fitting considering Texas. move there? governments make money? It’s still free even scenario suggested.

And ok, plan forcibly capture detain people inject will. presumably, resist, kill them.

I sure you, tremendous reasoning running office soon. Definitely! know people go hospital unpreventable things hospitals able accommodate them, that’s good news. didn’t want idiot couldn’t responsible enough keep low key. drove week grocery store, stopped skateboarding curbed horse-related activities, too. individually away people wearing mask kept thinking would happen bad fall got badly hurt way. basically approached anything hospitals closed. hazard pay. wish would've followed yesterday nurse Florida talking use PTO test positive sick useless sacks meat. I'd like know story turns finally says ""fuck it, quit."" 

[Insert clip news reporter saying this] beach yesterday. actually wasn’t bad. People mostly social distancing rain cleared beach. Tbh closed beach, many beach goers would probably invited friends extended family backyard BBQs. right space relative beach would probably increase covid spread. # Canada luckier idiots?

You see better half group wearing masks. I’m familiar area don’t know far apart hospitals are, would make sense/is possible move patients Bayfront Health St. Petersburg? ICU seems half full selectively illiterate something? Yep. 4 years ago now. Unbelievable chauvinistic comments. Exactly. multiple professors industry rock stars; annual research grants tens millions (my department’s endowment also greater universities). way guys going exposing year. younger, adjunct faculty responsible 100% undergrad instruction year. I’m really sure mean here, thought I’d point general, professors unions (only ~20% unionized). 

Given shitty treatment adjuncts, embarrassment higher education, number probably much higher. personally make shit tons. first years, pretty par physicians Europe make. enter field make tons money, though, meh. I'm tired stereotype 1950s-1970s keeps getting perpetuated. 

My medical school debt different matter together, really bring conversations cost education high school. four year college $50,000 year? happened?! That's prohibitively expensive. test administered Quest might able get results online quicker call back. 25% caught fall? feels like lot dude # States numbers similar better Germany

It’s really sad theme months areas. Sometimes researchers manipulate data political gain. believe one instances science isn’t exactly honest.

 learned college took statistics. think many people understand concept huge part problem. Thank saying fearmongering attempting address actual deadly threat 200k already? Damn fast. bit oversimplification. Xi Pooh originally came power wave discontent botched SARS response. politically important fuck one up. almost failed initial hush rather late response... rather redeemed. **Especially** compared certain countries leaders.

China also means done contain virus spread. Literally locking entire cities, tracking every citizen assigning ""health codes"", compelling everyone aged grandmother wear masks - none would possible US Western countries. Gotta fairly authoritarian state pull something like off. That, actually competent leadership gives flying duck. plenty authoritarian states piss-poor job decided fudge statistics instead.

I'd rather compare US places like Germany Australia. banging good job containing virus without authoritarian dictatorship. crucially, going hard early making sure everyone stays safe allowed reopen quarantining certain districts. anyone looking little hope, one? happens allow people believe ancient flying fairies positions power.

Plus would guess people letting kids go anywhere, COURSE less likely get it. 12 year old seen anyone live inside house since March. mean can't get sick, means opportunity. complied social distancing everything governor said do. I’ve wearing mask since March (you know, back Surgeon General Dr. Fauci told everyone masks don’t work aren’t good anything) followed every restriction. missed funeral close family member this, governor went said it’s totally awesome great people break social distancing protests. that’s I’m cynical. Also cases MD, VA, DC. BLM protests?

Same thing.

Turns outside super risky. indoors crowds fueling spikes. Karen's targeting Target ever since ran Live Laugh Love wall signs. corporate chains filled batshit Karens. Fuck headlines. I’m really sick perpetually misleading wording. Yes! several mental breaks lot stress pushups I’m getting fairly jacked. Lol. I’m # Sundays, exactly get it. It’s likely it’ll content cut, e.g. go lab every class online material.

Many schools going get economically crushed, lot budget going disappear, can’t afford drop enrollment much. July 2nd New York state 1300 new cases. it’s well prepared bottom careful releasing vaccines.

Our archbishop actually stated ought examine level Swedish doctors performed euthanasia nursing homes. people feel way really need step influenza protection winter. package € 750 billion money must paid back system next pandemic, otherwise hard lockdowns never solution again. basic questions: Canada done differently?

&amp;#x200B;

And count Covid ICU patients way?

&amp;#x200B;

Do put people ICU similar levels seriousness?

&amp;#x200B;

Do Canadians hospitals get money classifying patient covid like American hospitals do? Sir, please stop. hurting me. good even realize Dude stats don’t lie. Canada crushed Corona. States can’t eve agree exists. That's part people purpose social distancing US deaths delayed average 7 days. say COVID-19 deaths need cided person. assume bunch bureaucrats offices assesing deaths coding slows weekends. Friendly neighborhood police force executing neighbors little higher priority beach vacation missed hair appointments say? Well, obviously. people see difference. many people pro-home-welding ridiculous. think difference president friends lots stock drug companies hospitals.

Gotta make money! That's get high Florida crashing Toronto winning? Primarily Canada worship Altar Individuality USA does. said pay healthcare. said true. we're saying government pays healthcare.

So, issue agree illegal aliens free healthcare? Pirates forfeit season. one's gonna' go games anyway. answer quite clear can't say political talk. Yes, fewer staff hospitals public health departments means less reporting. Deaths, course, processed recorded. Yes time act came went. Time restrict cross-state travel cesspools. days long gone iT’s wE’Re TeStInG mOrE! hate guy, depends program, lot programs would want know one instructors saying that. Depending role, I've seen adjunct instructors fired less. Dr. Acton resigned Abnormal pneumonia going around Europe US exact time, China first genetic analysis them. 100% accurate. Social media platforms next nothing combat insane conspiracy theories covid denialism platforms. Go comments sections Facebook local news page see dozens upon dozens people downplaying severity, denying existence. Facebook (and social media) ban people platforms. opinions valid opinions respected. Wait, Target face masks? Might pick one Duluth, local one waaaaaaaaaay busy country sucks Central Florida definition of, ""MURCA!""


Incredibly high obesity rates, poor education, even poorer health education, culture thrives ignorance pride previously mentioned, dietary staples make Paula Deen blush, got it. ""mask-reluctant"" people know, lot resistance whether actually effective discomfort, compared politics US. new information effectiveness preventing *others* getting sick (i.e. civic duty) people got used routine, people least treating offensive asked wear mask.

That said, still fair share people toddlers, refuse something simply authority figure told to, regardless importance. Oh. know that. always thought India democracy shining example. Thanks info. WHO, CDC, NIH, NHS, ECDC, PHAC, CCDC... stats mobility.

Very similar depth shutdown duration compared trash mountain Good you! Yep small large changes direction health tend keep moving us toward health. Nothing perfect constantly learn evolve. Taking ownership health first step IMO! Oh wow, since trump? online teachers good job. teaching online 4 years. really takes time students adjust, especially depending age. Good luck you. basically approached anything hospitals closed

This wise. holed hole, I'll fun. “Hindsight 2020” prediction year bring response would beyond lacking. every hospital Bangalore, India run beds.

Jesus.

There's way end well, part keeps wishing does. target, gets burned one state Karened another. might need change name  wwz excellent read. MUCH better movie RNA vaccines novel. None yet approved human use. love technology there's way I'm going camp get world's first RNA vaccine. Especially rushed one. India routinely total deaths U.S. right -- and, given country's substandard health care system chaotic environment, obvious much undercounting cases deaths. U.S. must immediately ban travel India -- Bangladesh, -- epidemiological situation improves. truly insane there's still EU travel ban, one India. anyone looking little hope, one?

The hope enough people realize can’t solve big problems way currently things must band together humans defeat pandemic climate change. 

But remember president United States hope fades away. Pretty cool protesting cops. protesting cops murderer  post prompted comment. think needed /s. What's ""effective treatment"" look like? old still people still stand good chance dying? multiple weeks hospital ventilator still table, drastically reduced chance death?

Obviously actually eliminate threat via vaccine really *good* effective treatment, masks longer necessary.

Adjusting cultural norms people start wearing masks standard they're actively sick, though, would awesome. previous culture (in America) people going work they're sick contagious coughing everyone seen ""good worker"" absolute bullshit needs die. Locking inside? country needs national strategy. don’t one hate lol  appreciate optimism think straw man almost arguments appears I’m justifying rare case “expectation,” call it. almost want say didn’t happen statistically significant numbers. FYI Great Whites like noodle around quite close Canadian waters :P suppose new news, yeah see harm giving people proven safe. general find breaking success plants single nutrient like “Quercitin” article bit reductionistic. often serves industry develop nutraceuticals find inferior eating healthy diet prevent worst impacts disease.

I believe prescribing well intentioned, people seem prefer pills whole plants take issue that. Unlikely. SARS like coronaviruses endemic Chinese bat populations COVID’s closest know relative recovered bat shaft mine Guandong province. FDA suffered regulatory capture all, right? They've never made political based decisions all, including recent memory like hydroxychloroquine (both premature approval president demanded delays revoking approval shown dangerous political pressure), right?

I accept incoming downvotes. Yes, agree you, direct salary comparisons much good unless compare everything else.

I pay $70 month health insurance, covers everything without deductible (except special treatments dentist). never doctor bill life.

I know people get free university education here, example doctor computer scientist, go U.S. earn $150,000 year. Much could ever earn (except high management position extreme stress). US attracts highly qualified people extremely high salaries, course problem countries system based first educating citizens well free, pay education others, younger ones, high taxes afterwards. coming clean Wait conspiracy theorists find death rate among Asians far less... N95 masks still inaccessible public? I’m Boston work grocery truck driver, reusable masks getting disgusting noon everyday need better option, cheap medical masks suck. It’s sad you’re getting downvoted stating facts Funny every person internet expert field discussed. 99.9% chance full shit.

Local nursing homes reporting increase illnesses due lack sunlight, healthy movement social interaction despite places zero cases. kanye 2020 personally classify racism. virus around, large majority people currently abusing Asian folks would probably greet people 'white' Americans.
It's silly human psychology want blame 'the other' misfortune. I’m right friend, I’ve never disgusted infuriated political administration life. worse part keep doubling stupid well Meanwhile colorado 2nd worst nation tests per capita people wearing masks.

I’d rather go take chances college online that’s gonna suck remember early seeing anecdotal super spreading events, realizing way spread quickly effectively airborne. tried tell friends, told absolutely not, airborne.

Part big reason people believe airborne CDC telling everyone wear mask. many lives lie cost? I'm guessing alot employees worried making money That's get leader what's right, instead what's popular. hat her. Part problem bunch geniuses walking around thinking fake. also live Toronto vouch true. Kensington Market Friday (all small shops restaurants) rather crowded, shops smart least half people well.

Tbh. wonder set free trough polar ice melting. Completely unhinged every way. Admit psyche-ward done it. Usually, that's low Sunday US Point is, things getting better, new cases mostly 40s nearly many dying virus. That's good news friend. don’t see need classes open. kids Grade 1 JK. little need go back school. schools re-allocate early year classrooms teacher higher grades. where's proof something else *besides* corona? Yeah may well domestic terrorism. tossed guy jail couple days people would cheering it. I'd rather trapped house trapped behind bars. Deaths lagging indicator. 

Deaths static number. 

You taking static number (not rate) comparing another static number (not rate). 

To make worse, you’re comparing lagging static numbers. 

Your analysis looking backward wrong numbers trying base future decisions it. 

That fact betray lack capability numbers. 

If we’re understand now, tomorrow might look like, need look growth rate cases, hospitalization rate case, death rate people ICUs, death rate people can’t get bed ICUs open ICU beds. 

Comparing current deaths current deaths months ago ignores literally everything determines next month pandemic treat us. 

If that’s clear you, clearly wasn’t before, don’t much hope understanding either. let’s hope. Hospitals don’t efficiently allocate resources make money bunch empty beds. base medical center capacity 1200 ICU beds, always use, Covid Covid. TMC add 1000 beds surge ICU capacity started biting reserve. problem comes ICU capacity gets 2,200. point, it’s going mess trying find beds quality care across ICU board (Covid, car crashes, heart attacks everything else sun) take huge hit. That’s whole “flatten curb” campaign tried avoid. went urgent care last week got booster. Easy peasy, 0 questions hesitations (although I’m CA occasional outbreaks) Ding ding nurse friend(fairly new) care. totally hanging groups all. matter education intellect. human nature individual. Idk. problem electricity, 1936 passed Rural Electrification Act. Maybe something similar internet. Foxnews culture. encourage. Disgust, anger, outrage. reminds quote “one tragedy, 1 million statistic.” I’m wondering numbers staggering they’re statistics people they’ve become numb? I’m starting feel way you. could die driving car doesn’t mean entirely stop driving car. wear seatbelt, leave enough room brake, avoid busy areas. 

Same thing point. don’t want stay hunkered house stressing virus day. I’ll take precautions. Wear mask, socially distance avoid things like bars restaurants - live. isn’t going away soon.

I’ve Hospice nurse before. I’ve seen short life firsthand. don’t want die six months done nothing except hunker house. also don’t want leave trail Covid wake - think medium. examples articles claiming narrative omnipresent? Eat ass Several reasons. One, municipal firefighting jobs competitive. Seasonal, wildland jobs much less competitive that....seasonal. Also, wildland completely different game municipal.

Two...even municipal jobs, firefighters expensive. Cities short firefighters often find easier cheaper pay existing people overtime hire FFs give benefits, pensions, etc. Sorry was. still don’t see though, looked news coronavirus, searched Las Vegas welded all. ""within two weeks"". Sounds like they're already screwed Better anyone South sure... want money  over? ideas? bad joke side. Barcelona well-known tourists spot, international travelers. original strain might come anywhere.

The AIDS epidemy first detected outbreak '80 US, since backtracked origin Belgian Congo, '50. COVID might similarly stayed undetected quite time. # I’d also like mention NYC experiencing overflows shortages still robust medical infrastructure country. I’m afraid states like Florida might able stabilize like New York. future looks grim. agreed. bigger picture certain percentage Covid sufferers need hospital bed, increase cases likely (we fearful it..) exceeding beds available medical support available...

This ""flattening curve"" trying go. worked fine USA decided hard stick to.  

I'm trying jerk - get can't stay locked forever. fear going become bad month less...

I hope I'm wrong. best proxy aware of. better one would like counter with, would like see it. interested knowing much can. want argue without anything substantial better present counter, luck. won’t that.

Very people spending lots time countries comparative studies behaviors. go impressions see reported news tells nothing really America behaving average, craziest stuff. 

It varies lot place. USA, mask wearing crowded spots simply 100 percent people absolute utmost avoid getting close can, office still 50 percent mask wearing time etc. know first hand traveling this. live tourist coastal town, downtown outside isn’t always possible keep distance, mask wearing 90 percent. Hand sanitizer everywhere, contact tracing big deal, give number eat restaurant example calm contact tracer contacts let know someone positive eaten there, etc. know people quarantining contact positive person well. Imagine thinking rest world gives two shits American politics  could eliminate cars altogether, marine fuel used cargo ships would still outpace anything cars produce.

We get away fossil fuels general. Focus personal transport solve anything. It'll make dent, problem still 100% exist. Hope learned lesson! problem still testing!

Step 1: stop testing
Step 2: cases

/s don’t think anyone administration thinks going well, think they’re trying whatever avoid losing Joe wanted say experiencing extremely similar discomfort since March idea why. 

It crossed mind might COVID-related, really haven’t seen reports eye inflammation/neck pain way head headache/etc.

I actually went see doctor recently first time get answers didn’t seem think anything “serious” *slightly* comforting, also makes think don’t even know.

Obviously time passes strange symptoms side effects virus revealed, hope feel better remain safe. We’re together. said that?

I'm asking percentage C19 patients ICU?

These articles read like 100 percent C19 flooding ICUs. 4 percent? alarming. 37%? Alarming. 68%?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Seems like actually takes 4-6 weeks. Yeah it’s blatant denial really irks me. best I'm Dutch, give couple minutes find links country. There's small protests people protesting social distancing, masks etc. Throwing hands saying ""Oh well"" entire reason US predicament, numbskull.  Jesus Christ, congratulations infowars.com, trusted science 25% America. Given happened Brexit vote, think many people see way :( Lots doctors travel well. huge locum tenens (traveling doctor) industry. used work staffing company placed doctors ER, psych settings, radiology, anesthesia, obstetrics... name it, there's temporary doctor onsite many hospitals. surprised find many doctors local hospital week time. really try since others way versed myself.  giving poor medical vaccination advice get people killed.  huge difference telling brother eat bad apple bill gates telling poor people drink vaccine created paid would never take give family. live Cal. bad. Hospitals starting reach capacity. 

The virus bad. conditions creating create modify behavior create havoc. Millions people getting sick times, fighting equipment, problem. see threat virus work. People get sick die. We're inside. Lots people dying homes hospitals. seeing chaos. media start showing it. vote him, Dougler done great job. trusts experts, speaks passion, care understanding; afraid make tough decisions (such delaying GTA’s phase 2). 
I think levels Canadian government put partisan ideologies aside greater good Canadians, world. That’s effectively end country. GT student, problem University System Georgia - they're specifically blocking things mandating masks. absolute mess stemming state level. rednecks trashy uneducated types opposing masks hardly ""at top"". Yes...hence mentioned Dr Orange Dumbass. Anyone outside IQ 50 knows we’re failing miserably hardcore thing, gets worse everyday Yeah. common sense courtesy, people loosing minds reason. People like pretend see hospitals overran China, Italy, Spain. need statistics modeling see Florida headed. really anything Western. fundamental truth humans suck sort coordination individually. History's greatest leaders inspire people behind common cause. People naturally follow. Inspire us follow great things. amount people hiding behind keyboards stop younger people living.

How many people okay murdering can't sit still five minutes? that's arguing here. socialite extroverts stupid think creative adaptive solution go infect kill people go fill silence noise. Bruh never closed Yesterday marked lowest number recorded coronavirus deaths since March 23rd. Congrats! lot single parents choice bring kids supermarket. Please share research. problem beach bars venues around it. Nobody giving people crap going state park beaches, tourist strips concerning nah. work yourself. every single post israel must palestinian israeli problems? leave alone one second? actually live there, people think wear mask they're fine, lots even social distancing, make things even worse, people *extremely* unhealthy there. So, saying three months advanced warning, watched China, Iran, New York City, Italy get wrecked virus, Tampa rapidly turning crisis comparable Italy? USA population- 330million , 2.7m cases

China population- 1.4billion, 85k cases

Someones lying.. who? County Judge title position executive branch counties texas re-opening early horrible local national leadership constantly delivering conflicting messages? There's huge difference re-opening going immediately back ""how was"". blame re-opening much incredibly risky detrimental behavior regular citizens. learn live alongside CV. requires personal sacrifice everyone every single day. message gets across, US serious trouble. good too? mean went found post thread Vegas things open there, so...clearly are.

Now understand US country impacted pandemic. Thank teaching Americans really petulant children. good rest day, sir/ma'am I'm also GTA annoyed many people wearing masks stores (like 1/2 lot time) I've never laughed at. modern medicine, would close.

With 1918 medicine, people reach hospitalization stage COVID-19 would die. oxygen, intubation, current cocktails steroids supplements, organ transplants, etc. death rate COVID-19 might actually *higher* Spanish Flu baseline. main difference COVID-19 mostly kills multiple organ failure, *annihilates* old infirm, Spanish Flu used massive cytokine storm turned stronger immune systems young healthy them. part comment lie? 

Fuck shithead? Well, die, that’s certainly one way me. day governor ran protestor, protestor ended getting arrested, knows they’re going treat teachers see millennials ones taking seriously zoomers partying. millennials know married kids, respecting social distancing masks on. - Worst Health Organization We’ve gotten better handling cases needing hospital-grade intervention, also suspect posters correct: death spikes new infections happening next 7-14 days. Yep thousands people still died. Nice Can’t spend money dead. 100% mask wearing T&amp;T  doesnt. work still underlying health problem still yet disgnosed....

Just gains equal protection. 15.04%. Page 2. Last bar plot. can’t tell much MA, I’ve working throughout Pandemic NYC LI, see tons people wearing masks social distancing. probably depends you’ve going travels. guess I’ve witnessing many super selfish...Too many people acting like others figure hasn’t happened them...so they’re safe. enough conversations people clearly super selfish disregard others.

Unfortunately, think many forgetting we’ve gone through. started using cloth masks average person, moved aggressively full plastic face shields (much cooler wear temp wise, doesn’t impede much eating drinking, doesn’t exclude lip reading community, doesn’t fog glasses up, easily branded companies, even combined sunglass lenses summer. Totally missed boat imo. Ngl, it’s mind boggling people don’t see government’s job step extreme disaster reason. enter social contract government governs provides people. pay bills work us. send money pockets largest corporations industries say “you figure out”. No, step job. shouldn’t leaving parents youth vulnerable fend spend alll expense war power it’s people. I’ve two months I’ve dropped 25 lbs. It’s great! There's confusion term droplets airborne medical terms. without doubt aerosol spread, aerosol scientist define difference droplet aerosol they're thing. 5 micron particle leaves mouth evaporate approximate two micron particle. requirement airborne classification aerosol generated must less 5 micron. measure 5 micron source mouth dried room air? also remember volume particle proportional diameter cubed, amount virus contained volume. larger diameter aerosol carry much higher viral payload D^3. also short lifetime air relative 0.5um particle. However formites well. waaaay less dense 60% effective could difference getting ""infected"" virus killed within body minutes, asymptomatic case, hospitalization/death. Viral load critical case outcome. One day phones able recognise speech properly. moot. Stating misinformation masks beginning pandemic led spread . . . 
You say?

I'm tired this. I'm tired Donald Trump getting away directly putting lives risk (trying decrease testing, deliberately wearing mask, etc.) wish would held criminally accountable. I'm tired going work every day people give two shits get sick ""won't affect"" them. I'm tired getting fights family members make feel like assholes hang choose stay home. 

I hope future generations learn like this. disgusting blatant disregard fellow humans. careful.  term ""County Judge"" Texas strange title. judicial function. They're head commissioner county. They're like Texas county version city mayor. Well yeah obviously better France district actually opening five days earlier. South Carolina. Money Alternate title: ""California sees shortage slave labor due lockdown"" Talk employees

Also can't take care kids, em. 🤷‍♀️ sitution israel horrible. last day 3 diffrent families knew quarantine getting worse. Unfourtenly getting worse worse. mean, still think that. 

Darwin Awards, culling population, etc. 

Im going honest, first started popping China Jeff Goldblum saying nature finds way popping head, well Captain America saying whale Hudson. 

Even David Attenborough team Thanos, saying need drastically reduce population. said, obviously sad, etc, still, there’s part says nature find way.  Florida herd immunity finding work. We're #1!
Woohoo? Ha, ya. gov. really created double edge sword this. Dishonesties front see repercussions distrust back (and everything between). incentive keep economy going, that’ll prove really backfire future. may helped beginning, point, it’s going cause massive economic headaches future —regardless find [real] cure, it’s spieled found cure. Let’s test public’s belief authority vs reality risk; see goes.

I mean statement saying things 'talked sub' typing things reading words. that’s now, roughly halfway year. Meaning way past expectations year end, right? Coronavirus gone China, likely government suppressing news subsequent outbreaks? Whoa cannot lie, even considered teachers. Damn makes feel bad, focused kids would spread effect families. Statistically, college-aged kids aren’t risk Covid-19; university faculty staff risk. 

When school, vast majority professors age 60; many underlying health conditions. 

Reopening universities early kill bunch elderly faculty. fun yolo run hospital beds I’m perfectly fine going public. wear mask wash hands. professionals saying do. need bunker down. enough people show up, can't anything it. show, fire kick em school.  needs done full tilt, end firings. fair, right throughout May especially early re-opening states. looks like main issue stemmed activities started around Memorial Day including larger re-openings mass protests many states. first stage never ended, every level leadership simply failed Itsn100% money. can't charge crazy fucking prices can't come campus. dead person still pay tuition perfectly safe – dentist endangered germs, dentist's. Yeah... we're getting workers' rights back states. Corporate writes laws.

""Right work"" laws shattered leverage union company, weakened unions unable prevent ""at-will"" employment laws, allow employer fire time reason. 

Discriminatory firings technically illegal easily ""laundered"" via at-will firings... e.g. ""We fire Steve he's gay, fired he's bad cultural fit"".

P.S. love European customer service. They're cold they're direct. congrats, show handful cases things fucked Canada...now compare handful the, um, many HUNDRED (probably past 1000 even) posts sub fucked shit going States...yeah, think hold onto sense superiority now, thanks 👍 Iowa last year work conference, I'm Toronto

I live one biggest cities North America, genuinely asked non jokingly guy rural Iowa ""have ever seen one before?""

It car. IFR near 1%, likely 0.5% lower (assuming hospitals don’t hit max capacity .... rate unfortunately inevitable regions) 

0.5% still ridiculously high (even 0.1% is, aka measles) little research think it’s 1%. Listen TWIV starters. teachers/students die lawsuits start rolling in. You’re correct. next prohibition ammendmen gets passed? overestimate accounting asymptomatics. Real numbers lower factor dog could told this. job furloughed 75% us schools count half revenue. said would call us back August schools opened work picked up. schools stay closed much debt company survive, let alone call workers back. I'd rather schools stay closed fisk lives kids, teachers co-workers love job fought hard get in. They're still paying insurance that's nice I'm already looking another job, mostly warehousing hiring. point disengage psychologically folks let learn hard way; otherwise, metaphorically speaking, you’re fistfighting tar pit. love you’re getting downvoted accurate. massive amount praise NY getting “handling well” staggering me. Florida better every way. open keep hearing “wait two weeks” “bodies street”. People hell bent seeing Florida fail. hasn’t. Desantis listened science. protected elderly Cuomo sent deaths. fact he’s hated larger population yet 1/10th deaths NY shows people really idea talking about. disagree. need babysitter all, I'm definitely concerned formal education. think eLearning comes close, especially early years. office worker anymore glad servers worked treated like gold. normally could coattail good treatment them. :) Boss servers running little warm..... insert bullshit reason ever needed. Like  also hate bezos well. going people isnt really going anything wish philanthropic billionaires could use larger percentage wealth solve problems. right Bezos probably worst would difficult even find article good deed he's done. actually expecting coronavirus cases go down? course they're going go up. anyone seriously think they'd go advance herd immunity? absolutely ridiculous people need pay pocket testing right, realize necessarily responding comment. Moreso bolstering original comment. Early? would 'just time'?  new england medical journal. thing masks help anxiety. Keep pretending like know something cause watch news. airborne travel droplets getting at?? seems like really poor planning also important note even covid particle gets body, wearing mask viral load may well low dies instantly membranes, simply enough reproduce faster body kill it.

think besieging castle. 100 guys rushing fortified castle going go well (unless castle already compromised, aka immunodeficient), 100 * 85 go lot better. Even ""reinforcements"" scale many guys manage make inside gates. Yeah, lets pretend Americas Floridas problems politics. wish case. didn’t burn New York high rate. saw killing vulnerable infecting 20% population. Nowhere near heard immunity. emotionally mentally desensitized idea end-of-days scenarios

I think really it. 

As someone read MANY $0.99 kindle zombie apocalypse books, lot ""And realized needed takes save family."" 

Which totally set respond pandemic ""I'm hoarding TP bugging shit family stay fuck home.""  makes feel like I'm helping helps psychologically this. happens kids start infecting teachers?

The virus airborne makes school hard stop kids. pick school bring home. doubt. gonna work.

Our Catholic school Dallas focusing reopening, improving shitty virtual learning last year. want hire teacher directly educate kids virtually, little clue pull well. see didn’t actual point thought majority enough get away snarky ill informed posting. think people feel different idea say things? Darwinism catch soon enough. Exactly. 0.1% population dying disease 4 months pretty huge. time, people know anyone 0.1%, them, nothing happened. Development-wise, assume. Get help. Talking isn’t fun, makes feel like I’m enabling mental illness. legitimately feel bad you. Yeah fun show come fall. They'd removing principal top school district keeping staff safe.

It make news sure. reported outbreak Beijing city semi lock down. First time warning second time ticket, assuming recording warnings somehow. 1 day down, holiday trend. havent wearing mask yet always said want too.. friday masks day +9999 cases today. percent positive went 15.04 percent. but... but... murica!
... can’t breath
... health problems
... hoax
... gaaad’s wish
... u’ll burn hell
... last time checked woke free county know one reason backlog weeks deaths. week, weekday, check deaths Sweden. compare deaths control tested positive Covid-19. dead tested positive added stats added. doctors 2 weeks register cert + 1-2 weeks comparing death certs. 


Still excess deaths compares pretty well Covid-19 death.  Cant mask n95 respirator? work hospital Treat covid patients. required wear mask time hospital, surgical cloth whatever, n95 higher dealing covid patient. Many employees choose wear n95 time.

Can't buy right now. too. one asshole coughing sneezing food worth risk. Considering poorly restaurants following guidelines regarding customers, doubt good faith behind scenes. E-learning sham clearly point return classroom learning. Basically, royally fucked. Congratulations success. Enjoy fruits labor _guard jealously_. Aerobic activity probably worst thing do, drives virus right deepest part lungs really. 3rd kid isn’t tough you’d think. least 15 year around help, better worse. 

If financial difficulties left unmentioned OP that’s one thing, There’s law large families. US carried extreme measure contain virus wouldn’t many cases. finished student teaching. get job try support idea I’m going even get job. It’s already happening San Antonio. still hospital beds, don’t ICU space.

We ran icu beds Friday critical oxygen saturation treatment (esco?) doctors decide patients best chance survival give critical treatment 

This sub article posted yesterday article deaths, however, current hospital occupancy, seems concurrently decreasing, least Stockholm. Given deaths lagging indicator anyway, hospitalization numbers probably best indicator state virus Sweden right now, although can't find many English sources, would inclined trust official speaking linked article. Wow worst piece work. Ga resident here.  signed children online school. way going risk lives.  Elementary kids required wear masks. imagine cluster 30 kids class coughing sneezing place? find way manage divorced mom. Even need take unpaid LOA. 
I say though- exposing one weakest points society. Something screaming YEARS.  Mothers need able fully dedicate children.  work 12 plus hours day home care kids. (I realize choice many do- many men don’t step responsibility falls women. )
I’m sure get downvoted flamed opinion.  system untenable. dads POV... someone underlying illness allowed covid make worse died wasn’t covid’s fault - “they gonna die x illness anyway!” Yeah... ok, fuck years would’ve lived happily caught virus 2 weeks ago lack preventative actions. They’ve gone states effectively fought virus. one expects zero infections. Mortality rate going skyrocket,my prediction worse New York. Christ going get bad even second wave yet. second wave going much worse.  percentage COVID patients?

How full ICU's normally?

What percentage people delayed proper medical care weeks months?

It's COVID, everything put months needed serious attention ging showing hospitals. Go check Worldometer. 863 cases yesterday July 4th weekend. Expect 1000 per day numbers catch week. think parents write brother will. deaths going since tis first wave began? surely....but cass rising again, means.........? deaths still go down? Glad someone provide perspective. honestly idea solution is. know kid special needs distance learning literally nothing them. need army education staff (teacher, aides, OT, ST, etc.) successful. Zoom basically worthless situation can't replace many education professionals alone. Well without preventive measures like masks limiting operations things like bars theaters case numbers explode point cant rely testing contact tracing keep things manageable. left two choices: let spread kill lots people, lockdown. Maybe next time people listen simple things like putting piece cloth mouths faced shitty choice. Depends local risk. unlikely catch corona 10 feet, possible. We've got new cases week per county here, wear mask outside. when/if couple hundred per week, would wear one. I'm sure possible, necessarily, given possible, prove airborne point. right, could lingering surfaces airborne point. enough information know sure. mean, comes it, really could without Sarasota together. like teens twenty-somethings today never known world without Internet TSA screenings, new generation never know world use face masks U.S. rare.

Still, it’s lot better situation folks lived one hundred years ago faced Spanish Fly pandemic without antibiotics yet available. appreciate honestly. It’s getting word there. It’s sad shouldn’t martyr common sense Yes, read that. saying, *kids get sick*. interview one pediatricians part it. quotes him; “There cases Covid-19 schools even make best efforts. balance overall health children. [...]

Do harms outweigh benefits? case, means students congregating, could increase risk spread. don’t great evidence temperature screening helpful. That’s couple reasons. One, lot kids Covid-19, perhaps majority, never get fever. use fever screen assume that’s going good enough? miss kid. many fevers going Covid-19. Kids go school fever, period. [...]

We’re pediatricians. We’re educators. don’t want tread space don’t belong. [...] couple things know didn’t know closed schools March. One masks really seem work. effective. Two, physical distancing works well. taking many precautions can, think risk pretty low.” 

They know kids get sick still suggest sending back, anyway. know can’t provide answer happens adults school gets sick. also came recommendation prior recent spike hitting Middle America (and Florida)

So, sure, read that, also disagree recommendation; bringing kids back school don’t think something America yet ready do. accredited homeschool program?

Wish governments (both federal state) work together this, undermining recommendations scientific community. live strange time listening expert political. could wrong sometimes listening politicians agenda expert strange. Science falsiability. unlike politicians real experts mistakes, makes even reliable meant dismissive virus, legitimate possibility.

As others noted, there's also politically motivated undercounting accounted for.

So States political influence low insurance fuckery high, might counting. states like Florida political influence high, even insurance fuckery certainly seeing undercounted numbers. sure displayed like that, since least early April displaying deaths ""on"" day - official statistics. Sites like worldofmeters never use correct data that. store yesterday asked lady leave wearing mask. refused called cops. came removed store. Don’t know got ticket not, definitely level enforcement now. Anecdotally, West Los Angeles filled morons wearing masks standing 6 feet apart.

Fuck PRC. career earnings paper $332,000 actually get much reported.

In combat sports, declared salaries amount law promoter put escrow event. amount fighter get personally taxed at.

The money usually paid promotional company tax shelter training expenses, managers, etc.....take money (aka expenses) here.

And cash gifts. UFC known dropping 5 6 locker room cash fighters getting gifts like 2-3 hundred thousand dollar cars.

The average MMA fan actually believes 332,000 reported number average MMA fan following sport 2-5 years knows nothing industry.

I repeat reason think 1M could marketable HW could beaten top 10 guys. featherweight fighter would get declared pay he's lucky bus fare get home.

The reason buy favor fighter he's earning UFC 50 million one night still get away paying 2-4 million. UFC pays maybe 7-13% gross revenues fighters major sports pay 45-50% difficult question easy answers opinion. Yes getting surface seems solution, prisons huge recidivism rate, prisoners find way back reason. lot big societal egalitarian socio-economic reasons behind going change start letting prisoners street.

I want clear, I'm advocating anything I'm listing potential challenges come mind. feel terrible people going through, I'm social worker I've many clients years loved ones prison still love much. I'd love hear good alternatives what's going now. members society, need fundamentally rethink elect leaders hold accountable. Teachers school district already died getting virus March high school basketball tournament. high schooler also died. kids potentially exposed 3/5 3/13 shut schools. 

We supposed go clean son’s locker weeks ago. second day, shut staff member 1st day assist tested positive. 

There’s zero way keep every kid teacher safe pandemic except continue e learning. C’mon, son, everybody knows rich people important us serfs!!!!!!11 willing stand corrected.... also astonished He's gonna to. Multiple regions state already exceeding base ICU capacity hospital capacity. time. could expand maybe 50% cases could expand 400%, well... I’ve saved much money kids daycare us preschool parents nice. It’s like third paycheck. fucking sucks here.

Oh honey, bad everywhere. least chance get Mask mandatory Georgia. Florida probably never get one Trump never seen wearing one, correct? Smh Hell yeah, enjoy enjoy Today walked past one coronavirus quarantine hotels Perth. Non descript operations, heap people masks outside, apparently expecting arrivals.

Sure enough, 3 buses, passengers masks, escorted multiple police cars transferring arrivals.

Everyone coming state, Western Australia, must good reason - 99% time returning citizen - must complete 14 day quarantine, tests etc.

The state premier posts daily updates Facebook, I've never seen united support. regularly include positives, including flight on, row numbers, arrived, tested.

We community transmission disease since April iirc, little ever tended healthcare workers. state, borders closed (not allowed leave WA - state 4x size Texas), less open.

Stadium goes 60k capacity week think, nightclubs open, bars, businesses, galleries, really nice place live. There's ever present risk miss case/end society, urge anyone symptom mild sore throat get tested one many, free, clinics try keep out.

0.32% positive test rate.

It's reason Victoria taking seriously. Parts Australia consider almost free this, can't get control, going hardship us all.

I believe always take seriously though, see economy could function disease allowed spread, given structured. hoping get control, good luck US.  I'm teacher Florida. I'm barely near 40 terrified go back classroom, person. start back staff Orange County July 31. want go. Right now, I'm sure I'm going get virus. Due that, I'm trying exercise more, take ton vitamins, practice deeper breathing keep airways healthy. know enough. much keep safe. grossly unfair.  feel like need get Star Trek red shirt wear work every day I'm human sacrifice. Gotta keep kids busy mom dad go back working peanuts well. poor people risk rich get richer. Good them. hope see this. agree, actually think 1%, responding comments political leaders saying things like ""99% serious"". unions worried older teachers working, would make hell lot sense reform teacher retirement services. Texas don’t make rule 90 you’re penalized 5% per year retire early. Teachers work 60’s don’t choice. Protections put place older teachers, younger healthier ones students. Schools essential economy runs. Child care, socialization, meals low SES students. 

Coming someone works Texas school systems vaccine. need prevent spreading virus. act like everything normal. Yep. 2020 level stupidity caveman level. We've made huge technological advances wearing mask much muRiCA! ok every post USA mentioned every comment 1 million iraqis dying 2 million vietnamese dying god knows many nationalities? dont stupid. antiquated view American democracy. Well stupidity charming. 

Some us dangerous unfortunately. 

I left soon turned 18 greyer pastures (the city)

Unfortunately got pulled back allure running families business parents fell ill ultimately died. 

As soon oldest finishes school wife gonna aight right outta like SpongeBob. Already sold stake family business brother.. can't take forever  thats sad hear. much love art music teachers(n teachers general) really inspire us rest life. college student who'd love go back school person cant fathom putting health others. hope everything works feel right. anything itd look good resume school isnt shit quit job well everyone. Exactly, droplet transmission greatly reduced surgical cloth masks, airborne another story Florida people seem care healthcare workers. *in everyone top age factor, doctors know *a little* better treat it. Things like ventilators absolutely causing issues, aren’t quick put people ventilators. think promising results steroid....dexamethasone maybe? 

But think age group probably biggest reason aren’t seeing spike deaths yet. really hope wrong, could definitely rough winter. Data suggesting safe indoor dining even reduced density. Restaurants remain take out. simply reason go eat. It’s luxury, right. Going eat way get sustenance, one starve death without them. I’m sorry work industry (and therefore rely income) don’t see eating drinking public good anyone’s best interests. Moving forward learning cook needs skill have. Eating behavior condemn. ...I think may confused yourself.

It's pretty simple. sure, whatever mental gymnastic strangely feel need perform defend internet stranger that's pushing dangerous false narratives. consider fact country replete selfish, stupid ,whiny assholes consider science great conspiracy them. broken American healthcare system squeezes every cent dying. many documented instances clusters traced flights yet? Pasco like can't read.

Maybe can’t. don’t see anyone really talking substitute situation either. already significant shortage getting any. Many retired substitutes. Who’s going want put health risk sub year? kids split increase class sizes somewhere else day they’ll pull specialist teachers lose break. It’s going chaos. fall going straight chaos. teaching means pay. vote reduced tax bill teachers sitting around nothing. never understood America's pointed disregard hygiene Covid came along. Wow. bright? It’s doesn’t take eight weeks fix broken bones asshat. 

I’m Canadian know this. US healthcare system atrocious. Period. Great. Things I’m already doing. Compared required 8 hours day spent interacting coworkers office building 1300 people hardly think makes difference. summer US, homes probably least one window cracked occasionally. FL older, poorer, less educated, obese NY.

However, one advantage has: Sunshine = less Vitamin deficiency. feel like I've seeing variations headline months now.

To everyone brain that's smoother pearl, massively obvious case WELL SHIT SHERLOCK! Yea Covid ha disproportionately impacted minorities NY well. everybody turning States now... don’t get schools doing.

My undergrad school, plan makes whole lot sense. Attendance graded anyway, teachers must least online portion make class completely doable online, students choose whether show person online freely, school starting week early classes end Thanksgiving.

However, I’m going law school different university, law school makes sense. like idea half section meet person, half online, alternate, go in-person week. school starting time usual, we’ll come back Thanksgiving. Attendance still graded. makes sense, especially since grad school one hardest hit states, 45 minutes one hardest hit cities. Idk they’re giving option online, least make don’t move (which moving’s pain ass, since undergrads start Labor Day, I’m struggling find place opens August). least, idk fuck don’t try least truncate don’t come back Thanksgiving. keep saying it’s due LSAC’s insistence allowing online classes, I’m seeing law schools that. hell, considering employers look first year law school hardest, it’s fucking scary starting year, either employers still look 20-21 equal weight classes harder due new structure, (hopefully) they’ll forgiving. Hell, that’s even talking university. plan well, it’s scary many factors one year weigh me. ridiculous. mean \*wouldnt\* want someone previous experience working side side work you?

People flocking beaches, restaurants, grocery stores even bars still open. running joke see people claim “No pase nada” means, nothing happen. 

The hospitals trying best, friends nurses told got extra nurses came outside area assist COVID outbreak, huge spike infections something could probably ever prepared for, given area. 

I pretty worried majority infections 2 weeks ago going see extent 4th coming weeks. implying (we?) trust Sweden before. terms didnt / trust Sweden? shit. obvious since beginning. But, nobody wants take mantle responsibility. Pres pushes states. states (at least ones done shitty job) push county city level. ridicuous. Florida doesn’t care. I’m currently Florida work (I travel work) guy hotel said downtown area town “a carnival”. I’m content sitting hotel room instead going masses. Teachers host protest. lot parents join protest.

....totally Ice T's cousin 

r/TIL That...that one impactful photo That's fine 

Over 1 million immigrate US every year Massachusetts slowly opening since May 12, cases gone up. right way this. question much tolerate enforce universal mask wearing.

Excellent fucking question Dr. I've thought every day 3 months. Good lol could happened? Oh wow. He’s massive asshole. 

That’s happening near too, liberal area. People sending kids friend’s houses without mentioning father Covid. It’s beyond fucked up. hope something. Im currently student hoping come senses soon everyone country pile one space lag also changed fact testing people show hospital.  Early on, testing happening significant symptoms showing, meaning person die, time diagnosis death relatively short.  Take person test week two earlier, lag introduced case significantly larger. Ah damn, well case... seems positive correlation religiosity misery parts world. guess one feeds other. thought relevant post since first hand knowledge thread question. Someone asked info gave it. Proud isn’t word, need hear world isn’t ending still live life. realize majority excited bunkered long haul maybe would good hear rest world dealing moving forward. thing countries eradicated virus vs countries like US, it’s like tourists chomping bit go states now. Keeping borders closed minimal impact economy, save countries like Thailand Philippines. believe everyday continue alarming find vaccine 😔 appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* one richest countries world Ok also Darwinism. people stupid believe Fox news really losing anything wearing masks long smart people do? cut spending keep taxes billionaires low. economy. cut spending pandemic preparation. childless adult, noticed FB posts people’s “wonderful” children haven’t abundant, demand schools open constant despite hazard health/life posed opening.

They done kids home, necessarily hate kids, work teach kids home and/or forced back work one watch them. fault, nation plan take care people case like considering amount spend military defense.

But add fact good percentage people anti-vax anti-mask? may pretty screwed anyway. amazes people continue stop draconian freedom stealing totalitarian red lights since hell bent exercising freedom liberty. work k-12 district California. several contingency plans, district ratifying final plans week now. But, based preliminary release, think 100% want re-open. And, them. poll staff, students, parents, kind shocked results. third polled want go back school follow CDC guidelines. Now, think people worked public k-12 district think seems reasonable. But, think that's absolutely insane. kids even teachers can't follow instructions. fuck expect wear masks correctly socially distance small classroom? Even surgical masks, virus airborne, completely fucked small enclosed space without n95 mask.

If California's public k-12 schools go back session August, expect pandemic nightmare Dec. control. country hospital loads beds, fact, flying people overseas non essential surgery cancer treatments.

The Quarantine Act carries maximum penalties six-month jail terms fines $750,000, failure quarantine leads death serious bodily harm. Stop going bars parties. Latinos make 75% LA population majority cases centered around LA, would expect numbers. stop covid-19 long droplet. accusing dialogue coronavirus really entered another dimension US. many people deny it, thus rationalizing reckless behavior, people want cautious almost seem rooting increase cases prove others wrong curb recklessness.

The US becoming alien planet.  plethora people reviewed studies ultimately money rules all. Completely different experience Midlands. Table service servers masks, mandatory masks taxis, lots venues offering tables outdoors, perspex screens booths. Canada parks packed numbers continue go down. also BLM protests COVID consequences. Outdoor gatherings seem okay. It’s indoor high touch areas appear problem. Bars, restaurants, public bathrooms etc. Good know still getting pounded like girl blacked video  mean CDC publish graphs showing high cause mortality vs expected cause mortality+COVID deaths. It’s real thing. Actually covid major impact education. many students aren’t going college ready proper high school education pandemic. Colleges also suffer similar fate. makes see holocaust able happen entire point government set rules civilization. absolutely failure leadership require masks/social distancing/limit group activities. right adjusting incentives. Imagine miracle recovery rates mystery illnesses preventing mask wearing could see thanks simple coupon offering!

I've considered promoting similar strategy area US college football important many people: wear masks now, might get football later year.  all. 

Filters protect HVAC equipment filter bad stuff like that. Sure they’ll catch hair things, don’t filter viruses like. 

That’s gotta clean air. Hospitals I’ve worked multiple systems using steam kill particles air UV lights ducts rooms. run air HEPA filters catch really small things. 

Home HEPA filters “can” help, generally won’t anything meaningful except catch things make sneeze you’ve got allergies. Home systems aren’t generally built tight take full advantage filter like that. 

You install UV lights ductwork like, well, it’s super common don’t expect homes them. 

They’re relatively cheap help IAQ. article discusses good bit financial considerations regarding loans repayment students must consider. Taking year would likely use grace period get graduation get job get settled starting repayment. Also students scholarships may choice unless want lose scholarship, ""choice"" university employee quit don'twant come back. part story really want choose mad at? reminder Americans skirting laws visit here.

The Quarantine Act carries maximum penalties six-month jail terms fines $750,000, failure quarantine leads death serious bodily harm. data weeks date took screenshot

Stats taken US State Health website, look deaths PNEUMONIA higher covid deaths period

The deaths critically reported unfortunately

Not sure become thing people actually talking boats caves? once, fun beautiful, curious name comes type outing?  believed leaders competent. summer 100 degree weather full ppe wow, suits ppe kind cooling inside them? What? mean people decide go places without needing close everything authoritarian means? kind freedom bullshit this? Demand government. pay bills food, all. BBC excess death: may: 3981 covid-19 deaths, excess deaths 190.

In way trust Sweden's numbers? wife art teacher. She’s well aware challenges county goes online classes. Simply logistics making sure every student materials use big undertaking.

However, it’s worth risking lives teachers students.

As stands right now, they’re giving minutes disinfect room classes (being art teacher sees every single class). includes tables, chairs, floor sit there, crayons, markers, glue bottles, etc.

She six large tables there’s way students social distance without much small classes regular desks.

She immunocompromised. It’s severe some, autoimmune disease decreases white blood cell count.

If somebody school tests positive (a school 800 kids teachers staff required), school shut three days. Three days. sanitize school three days reopen normal.

I legitimately scared wife’s life. also newborn home. wife catches something, could pass family.

Reopening schools normally even near-normal terrible idea. faces featured huge poster every bar, every gym, every restaurant, every beer. idea hospitals run profit prepared pandemic time nuts. two things mutually exclusive. profit meeting demand, there's demand sitting things need every 100 years 99 100 years. profit model long term planning like that. Investors want return, vague promise maybe needing something one day. DiDnt EVeN Use ShiP NYC! forget abour funeral homes services wrings loved ones grieving financial instability. think it’s entirely different scenario. way kids getting sick different adults get sick. what’s interesting note virus spread US, apparently became contagious mutations Europe. lot previous information regarding children responded coming studies Asian children, mutation, I’m sure would resolve facts findings. Actually, underreporting cases deaths alcohol general makes activity dangerous. think drunk people give shit covid social distancing? lol Maybe unify people. change many carriers crowds people? I'd think possible overcome mixing. easier complain know sides idea talking about. Goodbye. would say it’s better idea, people get drunk that’s start hugging love man include surge ICU (converted PACU OR's)? Assuming find nurses staff them. One drug that's going backordered.

Also thrilled prospect getting (I work remote boss really care come back office) that's whatever compared risk her. uou provide link letter? would like see it. last stay home order claims worked lowered hospital rates 20-30%, delays inevitable. way enforce strict lockdown here, delay things again. targeted shutdown bars dedicate financial support help bar workers owners. flatten curve bit, also can’t even enforce mandatory mask order strictly, able stop people going parties family gathering another shut down. take forever flatten curve back May’s levels majority people won’t able stay lockdown long. vitro potency ivermectin Covid-19 virus testimony drug utilized manage patients infected SARS-CoV-2. Since conditions virus replicates infects cells vivo vitro differs, decisive comment ivermectin may prove beneficial patients cannot constructed yet.

Remember handgun kill cells petri dish (*in virus burn NY. people NY still social distancing, despite reopening. Social distancing remains reason low spread rate. they? think may overestimate much money teachers  states like Massachusetts New York converted convention centers field hospitals case regular hospitals overwhelmed. 69,993. haven’t stayed fully date science released virus, anyone give date info COVID-19 human body (what scientists know now?

For reference last info read 1-2months ago mentioned causes Cytokine storm body? Thanks Yeah, think someone highly upvoted comment basically saying ""Doctors fine surgical masks need N95 masks,"" edit comment clarify entire argument based fallacious reasoning, instead reply down-thread people probably see. spreading dangerous false information nothing cause confusion chaos. No. used clean UV lamp inserted another anus. US: *That one abusive bf serious ego problem.* they'll contribute fatalities.

Polio killed lot people front. every decade thereafter. they’re bunch shut ins anyway

Ohh, strawman? Sure, let's play strawman game:

 ""Oh no, thoughts! can't handle five minutes without spectacleI NEED BEER! NEED BEER! CARES DIES! NEED ENTERTAINMENT!"" Maybe get one full face protective masks plastic face cover, one. respect husband needs provide family. long take proper precautions I'm sure fine! best! ... counter questions posed?  Fire season start Cali! Look big brain Brad! yet county voted re-open restrictions all. recommendations explicitly said would enforcing. stated ""People information right them."" Since made decision Memorial Day bars clubs packed cases rapidly rising. would've possibly predicted this? thought dead longest time lmao  Try 18% worked CDC, post’s photo would causing major panic attacks. 15.04% new cases.
17.02% tests. Went pub yesterday, table didn’t give details, standing seats bar, table arrangement otherwise pre lockdown actually helped beleagured hotel industry, too. I'm opinion everybody stay home thing over, government bailing individuals need help. 

However, given seem possibility given rabid rejection science part good chunk American citizenry, I'd support kind split support teachers students - teachers students want school remotely can, want go back school. they're going open schools anyway, least provide option stay home.

Is learning experience little compromised remotely? Maybe. I'm guessing compromised bit teacher ventilator.

Still, virus going keep going people insist flouting science, might make sense let go get with, let darwinism take course, thought think sign quasi-DNR puts back line hospitals become overwhelmed. Right?! morons ""It's one get together birthday/funeral/holiday"" dont understand virus DGAF want colleges reopen reason want reopen states, money. lives bottom line. naive you? hell going pay bills food? Humans general pretty good. Americans seem kind mental problem. Plenty surge capacity, ships really used much New York could sent there. Ask local representative look kids. Ask boss look kids. mad regular people correctly stating opening schools huge risk? hear rest world dealing moving forward.

The rest world opening casinos pandemic? news me. N95 harder breath cloth masks. People know I'm talking DeWine already said Ohio mask mandate happens, county county basis make decision. There's gonna national strategy point. Trump made national strategy clear: cover eyes ears hope goes away. going spiral hit *actual* crisis point majority hospitals across country maximum capacity even rich powerful difficulty getting treatment. people start mobilize real efficiency. far south :) comment *specifically* directed you. cohort general primary driving force current surge cases. Yes, took screen shot national totals 3/14 - 2506 total cases US 50 deaths - 3 1/2 months ago - give perspective - cases reported last couple days either going recover die! So, actually say death rates bit misleading credit principal said refuse open, likely losing job process. Well done? Nothing suggests lose immunity virus. That's research said. guys season. Although I'm wondering, seeing tourists come peak season? see they're taking Lord Farquaad Western countries, citizens proven cannot shoulder burden managing pandemic. Therefore, it’s government’s responsibility, since know damn well citizens aren’t going it. UK: come guys fat, dumb, rude tourists, loud?

US: learned watching you, dad! clearly missed point. socialized healthcare system Canada notoriously slow. Try understand argument resorting name-calling. Trust me, I’ve extremely frustrated available data since began.

But extrapolate lot information existing data understand numbers make decent assumptions.

Based everything I’ve run, think IFR roughly .25 - .4% max. puts max potential fatally number 850k country w/o vaccine effective therapeutics. low range 530k betting I’d say it’s closer low range. That’s assuming 65% country ends getting infected. 

The reason get frustrated articles cases people’s reactions earlier today article there’s likely 10x many cases what’s reported, freak 10k cases reported there’s potentially 100k infected. 

The numbers watch hospitalizations, ICUs, deaths managing healthcare capacity main goal. 4 months think it’s pretty clear you’re preventing it’s spread country (and many others) Even campus currently “closed”, [81 reported ... it’s not. Overwhelming medical system crucial avoid. medical system overwhelmed, way maintain treatment every illness. goes well beyond coronavirus. 60-80k per year poor SF. renting house 3.5 5k/mo renting. everyone else wears mask uses distancing cleaning matter they'll safe. Meanwhile, America guided illusion unconditional freedom. Understood. Yesterday's percent positive 17.5% California go wrong? seemed like good job months ago. annoying thing is, do, Americans come NI stroll in. diamond princess. Cases clearly spread shared ventilation. double blind randomised clinical trials? 

A proper UK study dexamethasone yielded positive results. also showed hydroxychloroquine, antimalarial drug touted COVID-19, benefit hospitalized Straight deleted mine weeks ago. seriously miss I'm never going back. [""Some may die, sacrifice I'm willing look kids Im work?

Why work pandemic? moving nightclubs bars outside world work? Multiple hospitals around hillsborough already max capacity ICU beds. Check Khan Academy. free, thorough great math. activities that, definition, prohibit wearing mask banned. airborne say 239 scientists letter WHO. still leader, showing do~ Can't afford quit, also maybe can't afford die? Fucking disgusting. hell could someone irresponsible? Mind boggling. Viral particles disperse much quicker outside, even windy, people would exposed much less virus compared inside outside air still (now replace exhaling farting getting exposed smelling fart relatable analogue). remove risk completely, chance getting serious infection beach quite slim (not every virus particle successfully infect someone, viral load much lower compared indoors). trying sound like dick, exactly would solution be? really good options due virus.

Send kids school free parents go back work earn money pay bills eat keep kids home, parent stay home bring meager amount due child care costs find daycare them. Parent home means less income possibly enough pay bills food. also means Americans spend less overall causes ton economical issues community issues. Less tax money, hospitality industry destroyed etc.

Kids going school cause super spreader events, cause people die get sort vaccine. Herd immunity hell ways off. 

To me, really “good” solution. Thanks answers 

Real question Office buildings open floor plans generally regarded virus camp cold flu season. Assuming floors railings cleaned supposed myth truth? test start show symptoms, otherwise big chance test negative even infected. see confused, fact US citizen also Canadian. Hello, fellow Canuck.  tf acceptable kids?? See teachers die? Realize killed teacher? preposterous.

We done every civilized country GET HAND VIRUS. ""the way data reported by"" referring to?

You source Sweden's ""very serious time lag"" compared countries? I'm interested. YES! GO MOOTOWN CREAMERY! us learn seventh grade, sing aloud front class. 19 years still preamble memorized, *always* sing tune... ""Should buy allergy medication reserve hospital bed?"" keep focusing Oxford vaccine that’s looks super promising, unless something goes sideways next months get option fix fall. I’ve accepted 2020 spent mostly confines house sucks hard worth get keep living. Unfortunately none us anything rest country wear masks try put pressure elected officials. stopped worrying much nothing right fix anything, it’s control. I've said I'll say - people calling others ""anti-American"" obeying government mandates wear masks exact people insisting anyone disobeys cop's order everything coming them. wish they'd make minds obeying orders thing. anti-American not? America, using common sense means president. look up, saw Fox Friends immediately saw enough, closed tab. towns Facebook group full the. post sheep memes anti mask stuff daily. also online bullies “right” BLM topics since one debate obviously would win. Right, quit even one year thousands debt due degree recession. freshmen power point. look kids Im work? $5k per year already room, board, tuition, lot clothing free? Nobody arguing one resource information ultimate authority, also certainly get simply disregard plethora corroborating data provided us via studies carried medical professionals firsthand accounts transmission data retrieved experiences combating virus outbreak epicenters. kids go back school, things happen: 

Kids/staff die car/bus rides school school activities

Kids/staff get sick die flu disease

Kids/staff get sick die Covid

All tragic, know society greater detriment educating children. Remember, wealthy find way around this. children educated. poor socioeconomically disadvantaged left even behind. catastrophe worse loss life occur due Covid.

We need listen science, doctors, pediatricians. kids go back school. Don’t worry we’ll go back calling healthcare workers heroes! /s  Absolutely. really difficult times. know would meant 😄 Actually we’ve inherited helpful genes them, Neanderthals derived (basically advanced) species like us, definitely primitive humans (actual primitive humans belong genus Australopithecus).  Definitely agree this. IMO best ""two factor voting""- electronically counted paper ballots. get best worlds here- quick tabulation physical record. counts match, someone's got explaining do.

I'm thankful live state this. Judge rules favor Hawaii Put phone airplane mode pop shows cancel paywall New York *City*?! afford throw billions businesses covid relief afford education system too. societal choice made. Whoever said talking brother? That's chinese model worked well.

Your average chinese provincial official oaf buffoon barely suited kicking feet desk reading paper every morning. national playbook suppression takes decisionmaking hands, gives tools like contract tracing QR codes gives steps follow contain outbreak. pisses seeing people walk around like that, probably still better nothing.

At least catches inadvertant droplets speaking. healthy people getting killed virus, even die left seriously disabled life.

LOL. horseshit. I'm amazed many people can't read bar chart. No, it’s average age patient right sitting 35 years old, half average age NYC people dropping like flies. know virus nearly zero mortality rate people &lt;30 healthy relative people 70+. 

Infections rise initially without corresponding rise hospitalizations/deaths sufficient younger people sick spread onto literally every surface, point older people begin getting sick left right leave homes. takes time though, it’s much different dynamic NYCs initial outbreak people missing that. 10k infections FL 10k NYC March. I'm fat kid sitting sand chugging bottle soda You’re super right. He/she signaling don’t care facts truth. like child playground sticking tongue asked something wrong. would appreciate guys didn’t generalize entire populations people... voting 7/22 8/13 return every single meeting getting back school, single teacher asked, ""what happens get sick?"" Teachers already mentality need sacrifice students.

And attitude, teachers regularly drag work feel sick rather losing progress content they're teaching, trying find substitute, etc. many teachers come work sick potentially spread disease students? school yet explain plans quarantine students teachers there's suspected exposure. get tested? When? fast get results? accurate tests? supposed work home we're asympomatic? come work?? news came Israel, racist question it. racist. ask questions. Well, pegged 14 OK. unfortunately reached point: Unless people forced, won’t right thing. paid 6% cost baby. best private hospital Malaysia, extremely nice, top line facility, extremely high quality care, epidural, private room two night stay. $1700 USD. 

Obviously, difference cost living countries prices lower there. However, OB five kids private school, $15-20k per year per child, he’s clearly making good salary. 

Prices US inflated. system needs complete overhaul. It’s bad government concerned insurance companies would fare citizens, public healthcare system. mass protests country ok? Yet small ice cream shop Ohio non-essential risk people’s health? Downplayers, deniers, hoaxers required full PPE spend day observing ICU full covid patients. need see family pain losing loved one can't even see talk suffer. need see much suffering ICU survivor deals recovering. I'm sick tired peoples' inability empathy narrow minded happening yard happening anywhere need throw Cobb Gwinnett County schools too. Schools needed least make masks mandatory, even that. school system throwing teachers bus hope teachers revolt school system treating health joke. Many teachers professors risk virus asked teach environment sure contract virus. don’t really see ending without working vaccine widespread vaccination campaign.

If vaccines end working COVID could literally another 10 years. yeah turns like seeing friends member hope one day moral society, appreciation. making sacrifice...but forced unfairly effort increase burden sacrifice humble opinion...which become less humble vocal finding. Virus spreads exponentially continues spread exponentially! Americans baffled, uncertain ""exponentially"" means. friend mask requirements made good points. least elementary nearly impossible get kids keep masks on. becomes huge source classroom disruption trying keep kids masks keeping apart etc etc. it’s unrealistic force masks kids. state think necessary shouldn’t open schools first place You’re going turn a/c AZ, TX, FL middle summer? Basic life function trouble. Anti-maskers new anti-vaxxers. live laneway, first time pub across road opened. woke people shouting street pissing laneway like 12pm. numbers look relatively consistent state state ratio. I’d need spend little time see anything jumped I’d need data past 3 years see pneumonia deaths outside range expectation. may well degree. 

You still won’t close gap NY FL, NY similar ratio pneumonia deaths. Murphy heard? new strategy. ""Live it"" ñooooo... find themselves. Also, teachers presumably older 9 years old. Husband 2nd grade teacher Stage IV breast cancer rural Ohio here.

I'm fucking terrified. angry. No, wrong. That's reptilians want think. earth 2,000 years old. Always gas been, always be. REEEEE PEOPLE WANT Eh Europe. safe whatever. happen America too. matter time maybe month more. Shit go back normal. always does. evidence virus keep infecting exponentially vaccine. stops weeks never comes back like Italy disease 50% fatality rate easily contained preferable disease 1% fatality rate could spread entire country months.

Now majority populace willing wear god damn mask degree distancing might different, reality suggests case many states. Aug 29 counties around TN reason husband, daughter, kept own, see neighbors backyard seems entire extended white-trash family. Nary mask sight. usually manboy elderly mom living house. oh nooooo, least 12 cars street driveway parked. Considering age congregants, must believe Rona.

Sure heck lot cheaper completely shut financially support industry shut entire economy good work undone reopen bars restaurants again. Mark words. Bars Restaurants re-ignite covid19 exponential flames. think saying ordinary consumers purchase domestically manufactured N95 masks Australia suggests doctors nurses super adequate supply.

This suggests:

1. shitlords let Austrailia burn ground handling COVID-19 much better Trump. words, Trump bigger fuckup Morrison.
2. one US federal government even tried negotiating N95 deal Australia. POTUS, would offer domestic Australian manufacturers premium. Ozzie consumer would get N-95 US doctors nurses supplied. process, manufacturers would getting rich.

I really need N-95 masks use availability handy metric country's response. Trump keeps giving 10 10, can't buy N-95 consumer market supply diverted hospitals giving 0 10.  13 thousand votes , hundreds comments couldn’t figure fuck reading .

Collateral deaths - ""healthcare deficit"" people put medical care indefinitely - certainly going problem next year, though. O-H saying isn’t testing done. I’m showing reliable source significant testing done. 
= Faulty. 


And statement Swedish strategy wrong. Nobody trying get young people infected. would instance universities closed since March...? Yes, look videos London. argument herd immunity work. understand implications this, part greatful fleeting mercy way balance patient load right now. know what's involved balancing act, transport care everything else, I'm thankful capability still exists. Yeah, Japan too. clusters since reopening bar karaoke place. tough places impose restrictions otherwise thing get control again. thing Colorado. trying open schools fall. looking likely either. Cases already rise opening schools insane. can’t say blame that’s true. definition, America first world, along rest NATO Bloc.

Second world is, definition, Soviet bloc. Third world Switzerland everyone else, Africa. open schools, kids go back vaccine. Stay away awhile please. Newfoundland done really well doesnt infrastructure deal covid. Texas state country something called Safe Harbor laws nurses. nurse deems patient load dangerous, s/he refuse it. told take 10 patients, would refuse (and fired live Texas). Texas nurses legally allowed say, nope that. fear they'll start invoking Safe Harbor ratios like that. country deserves burn ground.  close beaches? Summer huge tourist season. People drive fly rent houses, condos stay beach resorts. That’s happening right now. allow continue? Problem? Let fucking die type shit currently dealing here? least one year Americans refusing wear masks matter bad gets. Spaghetti also straight . . . gets hot wet. None communists said anything rioters past month continued burn cities tear statues, practicing social distancing wearing masks. Hypocrites. Uber says masks manditory cars... Report drivers.

Fucking ridiculous Read article please. different prison, can't act responsible enough allowed public held behind bars number years.

Yeah, hard no. cousin said they're lying part larger conspiracy! fucking hate fucking country right now! long ago leader Ontario government vilified media another Trump/Hitler subject several large public demonstrations. Today Doug Ford earning praise sides aisle manner government conducted since lockdown began.  message people Ontario calm, consistent straightforward, entire province leadership deserve lot credit stepping fight pandemic together. USA heading uncharted territory million active cases given time counting multiple locations going critical once. even China EU experience that. Chinese able contain keep virus reaching critical mass outside Wuhan able dispatch reinforcements less affected regions earlier year city. multiple places go critical USA tying spare personnel resources, places may able expect help. applies equally protesters. 🤗 kids got tested Friday 15 minute turnaround. don’t understand can’t get tested others get same-day results. Begging question whether herd immunity possible US 3/4 willing get it, we'll see efficacy first vaccine is. Fair point though projecting go forward infections anti-Vaxxers assuming hoaxers/anti-maskers. Tinge people engaging risky behavior. 100 percent way 50 percent, close 75 percent.

I actually think perversely works favor January. US could 40 percent infected point, people last virus list suspect huge portion would resisted vaccine anyway.

Then get 10-20 percent population vaccinated - highest risk 10 percent (elderly) 10 percent afraid go out, pretty good shape. light end tunnel.

Now antibodies wear off, 25 percent avoiding vaccines much bigger concern. bigger risk early shortages vaccines partially effective vaccines. US higher maximum tax rate country, 51%. Continue online learning. It’s certainly same, worth sacrifice lives save. stories people need see idiots understand this. WITHOUT sugarcoating. Go Texas hospitals cameras turn pandemic around US.

TLDR New cases rising 6 weeks. [In new cases start growing earliest three weeks ago, growth June 21. 

Am saying 2 weeks long enough see clear trend? Absolutely. 

Even graph sent, deaths June 25 far highest number day since May 6. New College student, pushing wanting get (in person) job summer? live parents, don’t underlying risk far know. 

Got argument someone told I’m young low chance illness don’t care potentially infecting family, NYC (my area) seems slowly hit potential new normal, parents gone back work far fine FBO plane belonged previous king Saudi Arabia, yes deal company. Labcorp says prioritize exposure and/or symptoms 1-2 days, everyone else goes back line. I'm sorry, rats. I’m day 8 waiting results. I’m negative worries. told work days now.

Monday Tuesday historically Florida's low days even normal weeks. big numbers come Thursday Saturday. difficult....best wishes~ People blame protests, add people dining inside restaurants city, 10x amount protestors showed up. 

Everything PACKED inside. dozens people waiting outside table ! could put wig lipstick ol' righty prude Nigel. Pretty sure satire news outlet. article titled, ""CDC: better odds threesome involving Ron Jeremy dying coronavirus"" ""Top doctors suggest giving Coronavirus information could lead Hillary Clinton's arrest"" holiday usually reports low weekends anyway I'm still ""is asthma Covid?"" mode. make things better, allergies might raise nurglish head well. Naw man, y’all got problems. consensus. Even within state’s university system, school deciding independently Regents’ (loose) guidelines. university allowing international (or state) students stay housing right now. Many intl students didn’t go home summer feared unable return. 

There talks opening dorms limited capacity fall, freshman only, go one room limiting students per floor. elevators....?

I don’t see go all. people praising California saying “we need lockdown weeks over”? 

It’s turned endless calls “shut weeks” Little child, again, nobody buying schtick. made stupid assumptions, based fact clearly don’t even understand reddit works, can’t fathom idea multiple people immediately aware you’re idiot. Everything since desperately attempting save face. it’s *way* transparent. Scamper off, child. never way going end you. changed incubation period 2 weeks? thought saying 5-14 days - changed incubation period, need change contact tracing match incubation period. hadn’t heard mean, deaths down, they’ve really stabilized cases exponentially gone up. victory, extremely costly one. COVID deaths every day week average literally Tet offensive numbers. cases growing exponentially. Nope, that’s said. passing pandemic hoax encouraging mask usage would great place start mother 64 nurse Sarasota county. fear. Also may survive find existing health complications virus rest days. 

I wonder many around globe get COVID, kick it, die common cold flu months? Inject vaccine arm hope best  Yes beginning. I’d imagine densely populated countries like China India. I’d even think New York many died could give 100% everyone. Let’s hope stay home masks continue slow hospital capacity.. think would mess people reveiving quality educated?  Many hospitals Florida actually prepare beginning, weren’t hit hard then. stopped elective surgeries, got prepped deluge Covid patients didn’t end coming, slowly went back business usual. Now, we’re actually hit it. 

Some plans ramp back earlier days, I’m sure either didn’t plan properly beginning, doubly screwed, can’t afford expand/don’t know to. 

Most hospitals get funding government, (lol America) apparently handed based revenue, smaller and/or rural hospitals treat low-income patients didn’t get much others.

Regarding whether passed single payer health care able build ICU units - maybe? don’t know. seems like infrastructure problem, don’t know would covered that. Half experiences result in: explain situation ""it doesnt kill many!"" explain stats ""Everyone going get anyway!"" Ad nauseam even relate sub? dad loves tiny town Iowa, says go Sioux City people pretty much wearing masks, locally people not. It’s everyone thinks know something lol refer comment elaboration, however, source official FHM data. follow, followed, Swedish statistics start, noticed trends almost always downwards specific point time. true beginning. However, look period time data published later date, mysteriously see decrease, disappeared. obvious reason data subsequently updated, i.e. significant time lag reporting.

By yhe way, person commented trends. personal hypothesis. Well we're talking time travel, could go back twelve months something wet markets Wuhan. Yeah, I'm expert think still something needs addressed avoid mutations, *for now* seem big deal. point early obvious spreads. everyone catch market infected animals, could animal human only. Professors reach students coordinate. problem administration. Great post, trying explain this. Well small positive, likely work hospitals. TBT reporting, none hospitals Tampa, entirely different county even.

I nurse sister area though sympathize concern. Yeah, work elderly care also many people non chalant it. Yesterday someone came work pain throat sensation lungs. told stayed home, colleagues told count people work care. (I'm sure rule applies people working Corona patients would otherwise leave house understaffed OK!!!!). told least wear mask, no, also colleagues said pointless. went work, business usual. can't anymore this. I've working mask months want make clients sick. What's big deal, even medical grade mask, try keep germs yourself. Even COVID19, people could easily die flu also. big mindset shift necessary, careless infecting people germs?? problems casinos, restaurants, bars. think problem people stay outside, within group, cook meals. Relevant questions one subreddit want asked. that's died of. mean she’s right. social person this, went every weekend friends traveled lot. I’ve home four months essential work. it, others. It’s want right now, it’s need do. Thank you! sounds like good idea. I’ll email advisor. time..I don’t want miss opportunity too? Student teaching global pandemic provide great learning opportunity..if survive guess! 7-day COVID deaths Georgia currently lowest point since March 29th. People waiting November... feeling moratorium evictions expires new stimmy comes pacify people closer elections, people might start turn.... B L protests probably going pivot hard rising cases administration. I'm mad hell! they're mixed mode, means students coming back campus. That's part worry, someone lives works near huge university. start July whatever students already partying though there's pandemic going on. can't imagine get here. would much better online. would stay hometowns less opportunity gather every weekend play beer pong front lawn. Pretty sure satire site. debunked years ago: Yes, lot sociopaths there. I’m telling you, math teacher, average person doesn’t solid grasp percentages work. won’t extrapolate. Ignorance failing education system bigger problem sociopathy. Kauai here. opened inner island travel damn bummed. Cases going back up. Tell 700 dead healthcare workers want seniors anymore seems. hospitals filling up. That's need know takes 3 weeks peak complete shut correct?

So shut coming when? too... everyone else commenting headline? something change?

I'm mobile fwiw accountability

Yeah know he’s friends Rogan, podcasts still tons listeners built maintained followers.

/s diferenciate(sry bad english) breath anxiety covid, please awnser fast im worried mean, there's still plague cases reported lots places every year. treatable now. You’re right Florida... Christ. Except case, learning requirements affect us idiots. possibly fatal consequences. happening every 5 years. contained climate chage expected happen frequently. Add overuse antibiotics recipie disaster finished cooking yet. I'd say match amount PPE personal beliefs: deny PPE completely believe hoax (no point wasting precious PPE that), think big deal give surgical mask (should enough protect ""not big deal""), believe real give fuck, give decent PPE force-expose horrors COVID ward. Belgium everybody (experts, parents, teachers,...) pretty happy children go school children problem Covid19, adults elderly are. problems letting children stay home bigger opening schools again. get frightening people whole rather safe lot tests precautions. Next thing know, gonna swarmed murder hornets. ALLLL virus

Will polio smallpox, too? lie made things worse cost lives. states using way look “Oh still 30% ICU beds available statewide.”

Exactly. lately grasping this. Couple years? mf'ers now! Ah yes, well thank goodness college students bastions discretion good sense. People sub-reddit don’t want hear first hand, positive news. would prefer scream apocalypse. 

I thank sharing though. true measles, evidence showing places strict mask mandates place lowered transmission significantly. think like said airborne spectrum. sad hear. Best wishes Italy. Except could wear mask carry firearm, anyone tried prevent either, assert 2nd amendment rights.

The laws/orders wear masks prevent carrying firearm.

If licensing requirement prevents carrying firearm, 2nd amendment would obviously supercede it.

In case, mask requirements newer law.

Furthermore, absolutely states prevented ability travel freely states. states done impose mandatory quarantine upon arrival, allowed public health laws state (and federal) Constitutions.

Pro-tip: make stupid arguments. Notice they’re already setting up? Saying she’s going need ventilator soon. odds week bring custody sudden death bed? believe shouldn’t get tested 48 hours exposure. operable windows exception code dont see many large buildings operable windows. systems separate ventilation systems conditioning systems though. gets even weirder realize hospital infrastructure (i.e. buildings themselves) come generosity millionaires billionaires, government all.

If hospital gets new wing new department, odds really good went local rich person get it. keep mind healthcare alot better nowadays back then, lot ppl get infected “recover” It’s states requiring schools open X% days physically. cannot economy everyone dead rest world could get control leadership (for part). USA insanity levels stupid. Yeah last time rumors, even tried threaten arrest person raising alarm shutdown shut down. wasn't. thing happened Sweden midsommar. think even point zero reported cases weekend. “Controlling airborne transmission isn’t going much control spread Covid-19. It’s going impose unnecessary burdens, particularly countries don’t enough trained staff resources already.”

I think real reason. always gives suggestions perspective ""average"" less developed country. always best advice richer countries. Well that’s essentially true, right?  i'm arguing gender. government restricting liberties citizens perceived greater good. i'm asking right wrong, i'm asking what's DIFFERENCE?

i still karma left ... couple years 

We've people since bad. Like, current president. actually used word ""hoax"" back January. live here. It’s fucked. opinion... 
There small portion death reported weeks later. week, weekday, check deaths Sweden. compare deaths control tested positive Covid-19. dead tested positive added stats added. doctors 2 weeks register cert + 1-2 weeks comparing death certs.  


How explain excess deaths comparable Covid-19 deaths?  makes sense know lot Fauci trying get whatever tidbits truth public could without getting fired. 

This Fauci whether safe take cruise. reality lot know virus, learning every day. use hindsight judge whether done this, that, misguided. like around smokers outside. even like walking past smoking gazebo even smokers currently there. This, plus families kids multiple schools. divorced remarried, kids multiple schools shuttling multiple households. One kid gets infected spread several schools workspaces. 

Same universities. teaching faculty unis adjuncts adjuncts teach multiple sections multiple campuses. One adjunct gets infected 3-5 campuses infections. 

It's safe. want be, not. say that, Fair enough feel shitty healthcare workers throwing war can’t fucked follow basic instructions. not. Fair. Swift already months ago. Duff don’t even. They're returning empathy they've received elderly climate change. Boomers never gave fuck leaving future anyone else they're ones mortal peril feel entitled consideration. real ""I learned watching dad."" think expectation older children required / consideration take care siblings issue too. Everything I've read regarding mutation indicated infectious deadly severe. limit many patients nurse given

Thankfully, California, nurse patient ratio law. Total. 

I believe daily case count somewhere 400 last day, graph mobile friendly forthcoming information. Coronavirus approves message think metrics directly related. Anyone expert provide proof increase contagiousness always accompanied decrease intensity? even repost... I’m Florida many NY/NJ plates holiday weekend. people vacationing middle pandemic? Coming NZ, cant even believe people still allowed travel. Constitutional Republic Democracy. would like I’ll happy explain you, provide citations back statement.  ought scrap trip fearful Gold Beach? may take long time cause way more/fewer deaths depending approach (such Sweden vs Norway).

True, true. guess question whether risk future outbreaks. That's hard know point guess. Canada opened slowly social distancing biggest thing. Depending store maybe 1/3 1/2 wearing masks. They're politicized though. Canada ""keep yourself"" culture. couldnt agree more. 

I saw prioritisation document Tempe, AZ hospital. 

It basically points system talked likely cured patient live another 5 years live another 1 year. (Eg 95 year old pancreatic cancer would unlikely make 1 yr). got points added, many points means dont get ventilator basically 

I'd argue trawling person's social media. Every anti-mask, ""plandemic"" ""it's dem hoax"" post adds point score!!! you’re getting tested flew plane yesterday drank beer bar two weeks ago, don’t symptoms called contact tracer, you’re incredibly selfish. G614 mutation present Beijing outbreak too? seem make much difference China. Even 4th July weekend.

 bodes badly Florida whole backwards US states can't science. ppl sad easily manipulated. 

Social media made them. heard virus “dies” contact sun. evidence heat makes virus hard transmit? Yes realize demographics university going people think virus big deal, going huge mess. think trust millions college students back college towns bars open you’re moron admitting parents... sadly admitting whole families currently i'm texting driving run seriously injure you. logic it'd cruel punished. really true it’s mostly younger people getting virus? that? haven’t heard “senior lockdown” initiatives. seniors really good job quarantining don’t know expect economy recover much. People 65 far wealthiest age group. data — fatality rates hospital capacity — shared cherry picked version media reporting “new cases”.

Why mistrust news much can't google data together, info suggests pandemic, all. mortality rate 0.2% per CDC’s admission.

Only twice Flu perhaps one told want word pandemic means think know getting media coverage. welcome stay NYT powered bubble. Doesn’t make true.

You seem impression wishful thinking makes idiotic bullshit true. unconcerned pandemic sub. Perhaps one many porn theme subs would liking. Thats like saying 10pm tuesday ""a day"" away 1am wednesday. already know covid spread airborne saliva droplets. would anyone assume droplets sucked HVAC inlets spread rooms? would surprising *didn't* happen. agree whenever say kind thing reddit get downvoted hell. right. important question might percentage people area wearing masks maintaining social distance, conditions infections contracted. people still going grocery stores living people working on. could pretty reasonable job still decent risk exposure.

Or isolate causes - many people who've cocooned home human contact weeks, groceries stuff delivered them, contracted virus? False. mask best mean masks worthless. talking person, sub. someone lives AZ, might part it, bulk assuredly packed bars, restaurants, gyms, massive gathering that's happening since mid-May. really know. subjects need situation ones. it’s even known long immunity would last. Dump ass immunocompromised 60 year old probably isolate home bus. According one DFW doctor, lot deaths actually reported pneumonia/respiratory failure, true, probably skews numbers tad bit. Toronto, one largest hospitals reported 0 ICU beds use COVID 19! Soon hopefully Ford &amp; Trudeau Jacinda dance (they look half cute, though! ) No, believe random acts cruelty. 👍 nobody's surprise, people look sound exactly like classy folks michigan. Awesome. Glass comparison. Yes, share demographics, bars people top thus super spreaders. Universities least trying person instruction safe way. original point still stands. Nice try. Even normal circumstances 4 kids still going (or least caring prevent more) extremely self absorbed. current times? Getting pregnant pandemic hospitals overwhelmed delivering baby become much complicated stress resources staff is...i even know say. Selfish assholes good start though. trick take overseas job.
You get high pay work Middle East , working western owned housing compounds. IFR also learned things past months. things learned help things stopped like early intubation negative effect. “Wait two weeks!” /s 

Doubt it... twice many avoiding delaying medical care due high cost healthcare United States. Closing pubs would put violation numerous trade agreements, UK imports American beers like Coors Lite Miller Lite.

j/k. treaties, is. They're idiots like us, right beer. Based 2016 election, 22% people Trump fans; makes 2 million potential fools. 

But number bigger that, still constant output anti-mask propaganda everywhere even non right-wing networks covered lockdown mask protests ""but point? Let's discuss"" ""Hey bartender! Another Corona, hold virus!"" -Florida Man makes wonder whether people know Google, taught school. taught viruses spread body fluids, washing hands covering coughs helps prevent spread. That's 15 year old curriculum. people function basic skills narrowed yet?

I funny, hiding terrorist attacks, disease outbreaks, storms, floods etc thing. destructive, require following basic advice Takes 3 4 weeks kill person. Yeah Southern Alberta mask wearing low; improved bit since government handed 2 million masks via Timmy’s, McD’s etc it’s still quite low point sometimes one one handful wearing one grocery store/drugstore. Social distancing seems bit hit miss - working home next couple weeks due surgery colleagues seem believe over. Cases city low (active cases surrounding areas increasing - looks like likely hitting Hutterite colonies now. surprising know Hutterites adamant social distancing apply even public.

I WISH would mandate masks though rather relying businesses decide. good doctor requires run people pharmacy twenty minutes later doesn’t. agree you. loved bunch little siblings mind babysitting free plans. parents lot mind pitching lighten load bit. parents expect make role second mom. think that's difference. aren’t pandemic. Fatalities are

You might want take second look definition say stupid things public great news builds societal immunity hopefully without suffering outside US people wearing masks getting mild viral loads.

Wow that's anything works chat.

I think stop chatting start learning dangerously misinformed. Greed ""That woman"" bow Trump minions. Good Michigan screw maskholes fought her. Yes it’s March weirdo math !!!! either. time I'm sure want reopen. Tough choices... eCOnOmY Nearly 40% today's cases tests administered 8 days ago. past week, roughly 10% tests 8 days prior. **Unless testing *ramped even more* (which doubt since places keep running tests), labs 80,000 tests process right manually tracked data ""Confirmed Cases Day"" &amp; “Laboratory Testing” tabs [AZDHS 

Case graphs second tab. Overall % positive graphs third tab. PCR testing info fourth tab. Serology testing info fifth tab. huge issue. longer people wait medical attention likely die, Italy exact issue back February/March sentiment echoed recently video Houston COVID ICU doctor. 

A global pandemic make people avoid hospital is, add America’s shitty healthcare system fear bankruptcy huge medical bills top it. 100% recipe disaster either. Masks protect whole buy home mad stylish too. I've got really awesome ones. Ohio Department Health issued mandatory protocols restaurants allowed open outdoor service May 15 indoor service May 21. Businesses must require employees wear facial coverings, limited list exceptions.

It's mandate, law. businesses enforce mask usage. guess worry facts. prefer call people stupid. boss thinks ridiculously overblown masks guidelines put customers ease. wife showed symptoms 2 months ago started freaking out. tested negative immediately went back 100% denial problem. Hospital overload pretty important already issue cities spiking case numbers track exponential growth. PPE shortage medical professionals burning out/dying surge. one really addressing post COVID syndromes lasting lung damage. media talk about? Kanye? certainly going talk working class newly poor people getting evicted. OK, none forcing people back work crap, let workers decide themselves, taking away unemployment money scared death go back work can't bring I'm curious 50k day cases like 250 deaths day? What's different way determine patient anti-masker, someone went *had haircut* *had day-drink bar*. 

It would nice deny care making matters worse. 

Call cold, went gun shoot people they’d behind bars murder. Iran Kansas figure out, Texas fucking stupid. I'm originally Ohio live opened mandatory masks businesses. people done it. rare see anyone business without one. numbers gone down, even we've slowly opened. Everybody acting like June/ July peak flu season. amount denial legitimately quite gross. summer... consistently 100° Pheonix Arizona lived Houston hot fuck also. get bad now, November dark. 

I'm religious man, fucking pray Oxford pull wake us seemingly endless nightmare. that's quite gamble everyone willing take guarentee. anyone started talking yet awful monday/tuesday numbers high (with places still left report) sunday holiday? god’s sake, it’s mortality proportion. Mortality rates time denominator! so, professional response been.

yes, president wrong, therefore saving countless lives honest brave. job damned, Reported cases ICU capacity lagging indicators. Mandatory mask order effect week half. You’re gonna see effects reported next week earliest. You’re definitely fearful one, go outside. Take walk. Chill hospitals always report percentages available? Like many damn beds use percentage instead real number? can't say ""Morton hospital 1 bed available"" 50 beds, instead saying 2%? Deaths lag behind positive cases two four weeks. Pretty soon we’ll start seeing death toll rising Florida give accurate numbers. fired woman giving data CDC refused lower positive case count deaths. safe hope don’t catch it. “WHO” isn’t even acknowledging airborne. They’re washing hands instead listening bunch scientists world saying virus lingers air. doesn’t drop floor. see another huge spike coming within next weeks month 4th July festivities. Yea heard take one online class even sections online Thank dearly departed families sacrificing lives help need. wish could done return favor. people forever debt... never know people lie. toitoi mean? plant. ""Hey bartender! Another Corona, hold virus!"" -Florida Covidiots, probably Thanks! 👍🏻 I’m sure could break washing-hands-after-touching-stuff-from-‘outside’ habit tried! doubt it’s beaches causing spread. It’s nearby businesses people go like hotels, bars, restaurants etc.. Thanx. right first month yesterday. looking new talking point, first idiot speak Ask hospital staff Austin. Leaving decisions value judgment individuals conceptual point view great thing, need individuals capable properly judging decisions.. think we've unfortunately seen plenty evidence exactly case. yet, 25% tests coming back positive. many broken and/or incongruous systems country boggles fucking mind. GO CANADA!!!! That’s horrible I’m sorry. Really terrible time. tried online video games video games general? Maybe playing kid something?
Minecraft really fun play kids adults. Well guess it’s trending racists like :) anyone think going dentist? avoiding even though issue. called dentist day lady phone blew precautions annoyed asked

I'd equate risk haircut.

For dentist? Much higher. I'd worried unconcerned. Also London. East end.

Plenty masks metro, shoppers, frills Canadian tire weekend us.

Did semi weekly shop happy results. end town you? way? place worked openly stated spent first month two COVID-19 usually entire year PPE.

We still short, rising costs continued shortages N-95 masks, coupled massive losses voluntary procedures severely hit bottom line crippling way. Political corruption finest. colleges really like tenured professors can't really fired still guaranteed lot pay. good way get rid them. either professors teach reopening get corona die tenured professors tend trend older. professors refuse quit. smh There's always wind outside. air never completely stagnant. Even feels perfectly calm you, air still moving around enough disperse anything airborne waaaaaay less time would take indoors. daytime sunlight significant factor well. heard one rare cases causes bullet wounds back head. too! get back home think I’m going take Covid test  failure isolate initial hotspots led us catastrophic outcome lockdown entire country. better nit repeat mistakes. also worrysone Galicia region less affected first wave. allowed sick much pig dick want. joining you. long live police enemy people. actions past two months (two decades really) made clear. It’s bad people still don’t care. “non science background opinion” thought coherent, useful scenario.

""You need weatherman know way wind blows."" - Bob Dylan  could worse virus yes, spread fast, look ebola example. fact deadly, fact asymptomatic transmission happens, makes bad ironically. means lot people get it, obviously means casualties. people get it, care focused COVID19 patients, people die causes simply care available them. Hospital workers start overworked, start fall out. problem deadly virus not.

Consider also fact LOT younger people, count ""recovered"" actually disabled, still sick months.

It bad virus. feel like bad, consider also fact people trying convince people believe threat all. know really bad culture drinking deep fried food. sympathy one (on average) person infecting. asking think asking . . .

I'm trying hateful here, would considerate feelings considerate health? That's called dick nose. wear boxers dick flopping top it’s small percentage, doesn’t mean it’s significant applied millions (or billions) people. There’s also significant percentage 25-40s survive fine lasting damage takes years recover from, recovery.

There little reason dismissive simple hygiene rules possibility small.

Shutdowns forced closure businesses necessity people acting like children throwing tantrums asked keep distance wear mask. people grow up, slowly surely adult things again. Hawaii here. want thing. Osmosis no. Lies! Lies! Lies! question happens one child exposed? quarantine along parents. regardless kids parents miss school, teachers miss work, happens people came contact class students, janitors, principals.I dont think schools open, one reasonable since isnt control all. That’s sociology works get fmla condition? nothing little red tape getting paperwork filled buy primary. Then, inbyour state, like PA, claim unemployment even fear getting covid. something grandson us, living us. high work ethic home important. Look families 1st CARES act too...If getting benefits not, may worth try protect time being. Best wishes 🙏 be, always is. Usually headed internationally recognized schools public health like Harvard, Johns Hopkins, Oxford. going get sooooo bad Florida. Fuck quarantine, kill me. There's subtle distinction people (and you) missing. 

There two pieces equipment...an N95 mask, cloth covering (or surgical mask). 

One used stop wearer getting infected. 

One used stop *infected wearer* spreading infection. 

I'll let figure which, studies taking which, devices surgeon general CDC talking about. 

The messaging whole thing poor, understand general public can't understand it. long it’s reported died Covid? “Right United States people walking around masks … think healthcare providers needing people ill.” 

Is quote March find. 

The “more harm good” statement came California allowed counties decide reopen bars June 12.

L.A. June said due shortages lol. medical community needs bad they're short, I'll wear one too. cases, faculty given choice mode delivery. (At PSU) Fuck. good luck hope stay healthy first read ""Survived Spanish Inquisition"" confused. Uhhuh suuuurrreeeee wish lived part Canada. Probably hit hard, people see taking seriously. Almost nobody wears mask, almost zero social distancing, people parties... WFM go much unless pick groceries prescriptions. go walks keep sanity even then.. get least 2 meters away people others budge.. look like I'm crazy go way walking path passing.

Last week city warned 4 community transmissions unrelated. I'm surprised more. Supposedly see around actual supporter, going try celebrate death. embarrassing, owe better.

 literally invite country lack workforce, treat guests like shit. won’t death spike avg age infected 35. 

And 50, 99.99% survive COVID. It’s science. link shows high mask usage US compared western Countries. Quite high Many wall unit AC's well. turn rooms positive pressure though. Yup go, gets Epsteined death begins sad watch happening. essential worker believe teachers also essential workers. stories Southern states masks... eesh. would move possible. possible would using teachers unions fight PPE safe school planning, like northeast working right now. schools essential need open (in-school) fashion. question happens one child exposed? quarantine along parents. regardless kids parents miss school, teachers miss work, happens people came contact class students, janitors, principals.I dont think schools open, one reasonable since isnt control all. I.e. democracy

That's tell someone support actual liberty freedom - claim republic democracy, even though literally (much like constitutional monarchies Europe also democracies).  people beach suddenly materialize beach though, came parking places, took narrow entrance ways beach they're going go stores, bars restaurants near beach throughout day. Pictures full beaches illustrate area's people load. No. scientologists beach live Clearwater island. Clearwater Beach one visited beach America. lot protests NYC, easily protesters wearing masks, never 6-10 feet people. would say like ""just barely touching people around you"" distance (with occasional jostling).

Also worth pointing many states reopening, orders magnitude people going daily lives (like see Florida) ever protests. protests end insignificant rounding error compared overall spread potential, especially mask adherence good protests. Ooo[pppp]]]] it’ll backfire China since manufacture lot goods, without demand .. suffer too. would definitely explain cases explosive upward trajectory month deaths related covid-19 continually decreased. mutation made virus much effective spreading, less lethal time. That's best worlds virus. good joke tbh. seen fox news? Oh come on! Lol could slow played it, wasting anytime apparently. data pretty pointless, even assuming nobody's adjusting numbers. Since death reporting varies country (some report confirmed cases, report suspicious ones), accuracy reported number infected depends heavily testing rate. Also, family members. Yes medical professionals must deal secondary/tertiary people exposed stupidity see nearly identical exponential growth rate that:

* Australia saw end summer (temps 30s/low-90s)
* Southern states seeing now
* New York, Italy, Spain, etc saw end winter

The evidence points pretty clearly zero change infectiousness based seasonal behaviors temperature. Protesting might relatively safe late May, case numbers rise every activity becomes much riskier. Yep virus tell protesting “good cause”. huge crowds literally 0 social distancing going on, bring masks stop it. ALRIGHT. need start preaching mask wearing whenever people around others living household. Including family friends. several friends wear masks groccery store wear small gatherings. often hear say things like ""I feel safe since know so-and-so careful."" mean get feeling way, simply true. need open schools seems can’t even use basic logic. went store employee scoffing customers wearing masks

Name shame. ideology equal voting rights really works informed populous, which, unfortunately, not.  school district Texas starts August 14th. school districts letting parents choose online in-person school fall. currently plan all, minimal communication parents/students. I’m getting close bailing school district completely homeschooling kids anyways, since parents still working home. Making schedule got better chaos end spring semester. Wtf?? made mind think outside box. Maybe correct. Summer season that's snowbirds go home. Plenty tourists come every summer enjoy beaches. Almost like police actually existed protect serve would help that..... Especially regions people congregate indoors air conditioning says much people neglect statistics school. nothing else. risk increase somewhat, still much fleeting exposure compared indoors (where basically marinate infected air prolonged time). Barr infected entry? can’t seriou. convenient... Jeez, yeah can’t even imagine. assume public middle/elementary schools open, parents aren’t gonna able opt kids work. shitty situation :/ Oh dear, that's unfortunate...and convenient  Hong Kong citizen, seeing powder keg could could blow anytime now. 

Yes number new cases hovering around zero, restaurants bars packed people without protection social distancing. Many people become overly complacent.

All takes one incident someone virus shows one places weekend, boom.. cluster infected people. “Bar Lives Matter” mad? I’m mad. I’m getting increasingly furious badly US handled this. 

It’s unbelievable immensely they’ve fucked up. They've gone countries effectively ineffectively fought virus. America outlier. developed/developing country world doing. Nah: retire

They bread? Tell eat cake, then, right? Yall thinking way much it. Whether like masks 100% prevent spreading catching it. although decreases chances aforementioned routes. ALLLL virus matter one's immune system able fight improvising. 


You wearing masks January February flu cole COVID19 recovered. normally full. That’s sure shit. apparently sizable portion population idiots too. It’s almost countries share common moronic bloodline. Source- currently live Hawaii rushing open quarantine plague monkeys mainland neck mask wearing neighbors miss sweet tourist dollars. Territorial issues complicated! ever heard president national address asking people wear mask? neither! Oh dip reap sow wearing masks social distancing obvious much ask. drivers actually make decent money, one gets screwed business owner. 

Lots essential workers risk life every day extra money. 

If anything tip pizza drivers people tip like shit. rest like GH, INSTA, UBER eats fuck hard. 

They scam businesses like Monsanto seeds lawsuits forcing pay money. 

Seriously need read companies work donate extra money Local food bank shelter people need it; guy making $20-$30hr delivering third party app. Sounds like things really bad Houston area. need take aggressive action limit virus transmission. Time life death decisions. Both? I’ve never embarrassed American, I’ve never angry “fellow” North Carolinians.


We UK start offering let states rejoin us No, think people say Americans ignorant they’re saying education system bad, I’m confirming that.

No culture decides ignorant because, ignorance happens result government dropping ball teaching people process information. Seeing wearing mask linked psychopathy narcissism, would appreciate people proudly maskless would good put names list know hell avoid over. long US deaths start reflecting surge cases? Oh well. us actually take virus seriously get crazy anti-mask crowd finally take chances without affecting anyone else. Sounds like win-win me. deaths lag.

Exactly. Fauci smart man. knows lie masks skirt around truth save job economy.

This Sweden's curve rolling 7-day average deaths *reporting different curve deaths *death site also plots report date curve, dotted line. Note always lagging behind actual deaths. Sweden - **just like every country** - lag reporting cause death. since countries report deaths report date, ever see one curve them, made aware reporting lag.

Both curves flaws need aware looking them. grand fucking conspiracy, simple fact statistics reporting works.

The report-date curve flawed always delayed compared real deaths. show trend pretty accurately, going week two behind.

The death-date curve flawed last two weeks going incomplete. show trend accurately, without delay, two weeks ago. last two weeks always show sharp downward trend, always disregard talking trend. it?! Spanish Flu 1918 killed around 675,000 Americans. COVID-19 already killed 130,000 Americans. Spanish Flu WORSE COVID-19 already killed 130,000! Yes, bad. us getting sick time = lots deaths lack medical attention. normal desiccated setting, COVID-19 pretty survivable, setting? Good luck.

Headlines seek infantilize disempower real movers shakers economy social change. Interesting timing. Meanwhile, 45 year old pudding ring thinks he's John Wayne walking restaurants without mask. $$$... Things aren’t black white. children make decisions whether get infected COVID-19.

/Murikah! there’s also end sight, things aren’t getting better. pro-mask people seem willing forever, express despair never seeing another human’s full face again, get ostracized. Masks never going go away virus never going go away.  ideal either. 

There many single parents - women whose husbands died, men whose wives died, divorced, men women never stuck around raise kids. 

Your solution (men getting better jobs 2nd jobs) even address atypical households. 

And plenty women choose work. want use college degrees SAHMs. Plenty women get bored and/or depressed staying home kids.

And toys salary pays for, retirement, college savings, newer vehicle mine gets run down.

Anyway, schools want households teach, pay it. can't afford quit job teach kid first grade. Heading one tonight. post thousands people got fine side affects, constant posts like peole terrified. Soooooo another month pseudo lockdown? you’re cute. Clearly talking shit know nothing about.

[Vancouver’s curve still flat month later. excellent work ChiCom comrade... sow seeds. remember desperately HOPING hoax. first little tying certain date proving Wuhan. got certain point (while government still reporting ~60 deaths something like that) getting videos inside hospitals terrifying. one black tagging living people triage fucking chilling--like something I'd seen TV.

And seems so...horrifyingly normal. We've seen Italy, NYC, Spain, Brazil, worse scenes still Ecuador, constant background noise mass graves disaster triage spiking death rates feels...normal. literally shaking every time checked news two straight weeks got bad Italy. look sigh. Could Location based. Certain states Mask mandates odds states something pops order ride. real Fun fact, got vegas. actually pretty common warm-ish bodies water like lakes. sure worldwide. Generally one want lakewater going nose. brainmatter devoured aomebas sounds terrifying.

Notice workers places actually labour rights, like Germany, compulsion fawn like American customer service? Rules thee, never me. Insanity! wrong people?

Also USA secured supplies moderna vaccine. It’s hedging risk case one works. Nah. garlic. gotta eat fresh tumeric underwear. Trust me. work produce “We want money. take responsibility act (which know will).” I'm across county St. Pete. thing except instead beaches go kayaking mangroves / beach somewhere.

They're worried raaats way slave holders lol. Right. sooooo pragmatic ignore mask wearing would save lives wait vaccine. soooo pragmatic spread rapid rate collapse hospital two kill even people need care. 4th July South Lake Tahoe years back. Hot hell, drunk idiots everywhere, beach bunch black dust, saw guy heart attack rushed ambulance paramedics attempted save him. cool thing day firework show. Skip festivities beaches enjoy evening show. wouldn’t 4th July brought National Guard help Border Patrol. bringing help hospitals? would wait around two months, judging happened US countries. I'm sure America keep moving forward utter stupidity. live business Corpus, ignorance frustrating. People outright refusing wear masks, saying won’t go business requires (which them), many still don’t even believe real thing weren’t really affected first wave. 

Things going keep getting worse people stupid selfish. think it’s fear mongering control, contract it. even still won’t take proper precautions prevent spread others. Nah, they’ll face massive budget cuts increase class sizes. Hope “open ‘er up” folks okay kid kindergarten class 60. 

Source: teacher bullshit before. general rule thumb tip certain percent, percent risen time. remember tipping 15% total cost meal used minimum standard would tip really liked service. believe people frown upon tipping all, punish server didn’t like something restaurant (which nice since punishing server doesn’t affect restaurant all). Nowadays minimum tip meal restaurant 18% total cost meal, like 12% things like delivery, normally leave tip cleaning staff staying hotel (usually dollars, I’m sure even others tip hotel staff). I’m sure numbers come from, always seem find others. certain percentage generally expected. There’s also stereotypes certain racial groups bad tippers, don’t know rumor came people told they’ve witnessed anecdotally. Might stereotype causes servers wary racial groups providing less service think won’t tip. There’s also studies show female servers likely get good tips wear makeup (the study might lipstick), I’ve also heard friends food industry. get tips wear makeup barely don’t. think happen once?

... I've assumed I'd getting Covid-19 since February-March. far, good. One lies seem get results getting pandemic control.

The lie remains seen whether effective winning election. subreddits still like “we accomplished goal lockdown, hospitals aren’t overwhelmed”. I’m like “yes are” basically react “la la la can’t hear you”.

Keep champ, goalposts moved ""national deaths el oh el"" What’s amazing even news, sadly. Wishful thinking willful ignorance think would anything case people locked socially distancing plus alcohol Seems originated “San Juan”, 23 June, probably linked person traveling Brazil Yup remember article posted Ivermectin earlier year. surprised seen developments Blame game Hello, work cable company I’m still go houses time. wear mask matter what, idc customer long aren’t literally face. went house week ago mask customer told “take off, get fuck out”.

To me, don’t wanna wear mask, cool. I’m going to, you’re gonna give ultimatum wearing one. don’t get services think give Texas government much credit. They’re calling cavalry, friend.

I’m saying one life death one fucking holiday. 

And yes, made statistic. Feel free Google. Lmao that’s cute little jab country... doctors even seeing covid patients Canada still getting around seeing patients broke bones 8 weeks ago?

If parents aren’t sick enough hospital, it’s reasonable assume don’t need backlogging system getting covid test make Facebook post it.

I hope teachers stay safe. deserve much money paid. failure leadership failure people? Everyone Florida internet could see mayors wearing mask stops Covid. mayor says wear one, stop wearing it. People fucking stupid listen experts. Florida full smart people instead dumbass rednecks old people would wear masks matter mayor said. It’s manageable testing, tracing isolating. value put trillions economy - let’s testing. Many protestors wore masks seems far less common pictures. said can't survive hot tempertures spread really low, South America Australia initial cases (who got europe/china) started spread disesease strength rest world. end droplet airbourne.

Everywhere see different results different claims.
Can build motherfucking lab send damn corona lab tests see AXTUALLY stop ""guessing"" ""suring"" globally use right measures order prevent virus spreading mutating.

Like airbourne damn cloth masks prevent spreading virus literally small enough pass thrkugh easily like claims cloth medicinal masks literally useless wearing public anywhere true. [Florida sure lot pneumonia deaths think doctor's evaluation? think say ""ahh turned 70 yesterday, sadly longer able use ICU"" evaluations nothing new, grandma 87 go denied ICU treatment 2014 would survive it. Probably several factors play.

With seasonal illnesses, like common cold flu, also role people spend time outdoors less crowded compartments, windows open often (air circulation removes droplets somebody sneezes), sunlight fresh fruits vegetables provide vitamins strengthens immune system.

Influenza virus also spreads worse warm humid conditions cold dry (there experiment confirming it), know comparable studies SARS-2. tropical climate temperatures stay roughly year round flue season coincides rain season, attributed people staying indoors more.

P.S.

Of note fact smallpox seasonal (winter spring). seems factors similarly affect completely different diseases transmitted respiratory droplets. australia well local area beds? thought area pretty good beds article came 4 places ICU beds regular hospital bed capacity dipping. 

Didn't think I'd see quickly here. I’m sure made 7 digits fighting though. That’s probably podcasting shit no? spelled ""I internet connection couch mom's basement"" incorrectly. Really? purposefully missing point, super dense?

And yet original comment stands nearly 100 points, person made attempt clarify trying accomplish meaningless anecdote. now. Exponential growth scares shut me. YES. say cannot, think countries like New Zealand exist? give faculty daily supply N95s. hospital receives federal funding must turn patients away. medical screening exam cannot denied facilities. 


Private hospitals receive federal money let people die steps Nice!! Well done Toronto Therefore, recommendation individuals refrain eating foods high saturated fats sugar instead consume high amounts fiber, whole grains, unsaturated fats, antioxidants boost immune function (Connaughton et al., 2016). announced protest party, invited people, threw protest party.

They try say something positive-sounding country, done plenty countries past. basically fluff. numbers terrifying consider lag time test results. taking 4-6 days get results back past 2 weeks. would mean numbers tests taken Tuesday past week unless everyone Florida using 15 mins test, probably not. RemindMe! December 1st I've told great thing Freedumb, go get covid. choice take chances. Yet, none people think consequences like healthcare workers dealing overwhelming amount extra hours, lack PPE getting virus themselves. guess worry getting it, worry giving others including healthcare workers. know students primary job Canada US learn. culture people job clean up.

Comment u/customerny

And reflected selfishness American society. Even war waged on..... masks. rights. decision. me. Never we.

Learning academics. learning social cues. learning responsibility. learning function caring, empathetic adult society. friend mine Canada traveling nurse got sent like..... Nunevet someplace super far north couple times. made crazy good money live kid ex husband six months. Aw. Yeah learned keeping simple really keeps focus kid ♡ According Dr know, opiates actually fairly innocuous far impact body, long remember breathe.
He seemed think fairly important caveat. 

Assuming right, yeah, respiratory conditions would probably make opiates bad idea. could guessed? point I’m curious nobody done yet. could totally valid anecdotal case study prove COVID hoax, putting family friends risk. 

To top also use opportunity find like minded people huge house party. Make sure open windows doors run shit outta AC. would even set go-fund-me sheeple throw away money paying Project X style movie!!! 

Seems like obvious win-win get time deducted records iirc shut everything down? Well buses going. grocery stores open. Plenty big-box retail stores like Canadian Tire etc. USA shut things shut down. yeah.

Those countries inflating numbers way demonstrated last post. least according Dr. Birx aren't.

Additionally, masks helping airborne. argument water droplets. there's growing evidence airborne. Therefore n95 mask ill equipped filter it.

 

**n95** mask rated filter 0.3 microns virus anyone gives shit EU27 begs differ. Damn straight “Hey county hasn’t ravaged covid, let’s take contagious people there” solid theory. firefighters wear masks wildfires outdoors?

Why don’t surgeons get ill mid-transplant?

How come factory workers don’t pass droves every day assembly line?

Why never stumbled corpse trick treater November 1st?

Unfortunately, rely simplifying assumptions guesswork. real way find live find out, US gonna apparently. even question? Yes!

Do wait 2 weeks still? Kids summer vacations NO! Stay home. mandating masks, enforcing. What's point?? Virginia needs strict. driving nuts. yes 
the virus cannot legally enter body without consent 27 already know us won’t this. 

I'm mid-20s husband 30, we're expecting first kid (I know, GREAT timing) we've taking super seriously. us noticed perspective things changing, mainly watch TV. many scenes TV shows crowds parties people standing super close strangers we've admitted makes us feel anxious now. me, I've always introvert I've never claustrophobic esp crowds, socializing energy. now, see things TV movies makes heart speed get stressed. husband always mega-extrovert says things like ""wow look how...close everyone is. can't imagine worrying catching something."" 

This may temporary change. Maybe go back ends slowly things go back prepandemic normalcy. part worries us new fears anxiety things like post-COVID world. know.  Haha yeah state Wisconsin US exact thing. Maybe worse.

If opening bars indication what's come.....well good luck. TLDR article claims little benefit universal masking. masking symptomatic individuals care effective.

My take this. piss poor testing really know it. Therefore everyone wear mask safe. overkill? article would suggest so. super easy do? Yes. ""better safe sorry"" mentality? Yes. places universal masking seen drops cases. Yes.

Please use one article form opinions, use reason OP. understand type thing major news back March/April there's little info mainstream media. happens show needing ICU full? die sidewalk? got data Johns Hopkins University's COVID database, still ""media playing mind""? recommend getting information? surprise. It’s going get worse. don’t understand people claim liberty infect others. Turns singing closed room might also big risk factor. What's happening people acting like information new know feel responsibility catastrophe we're experiencing. They'll mandate things roll back openings big holiday use excuse know bad now. u mad?  mean much person replying says ""larger re-openings mass protests"". think sufficiently addressed both.

Nothing ""the right"". sure feel like need address politically. zoom cocktail parties pointless. care media tries get think- oh here's rich celebrities guy man bun it- one really wants that. sane world, would convince people need wear masks, instead country full anti-science idiots. *a lot  Don’t need ICU bed alcohol poisoning gets ya first. It’s also reported tens thousands undercounted Trump Administration deemed hoax, time time again. 

They serious dealing facing COVID19, know to. 

We've lied many times over. And, suppressed truth forcing testing slow stop entirely country burns. it’s “on track” two weeks, it’s likely late stop it. 

Even shut region today, people currently sick infected aware yet would fill beds 2 weeks time. difference. think reason Japan done relatively well government done practically nothing largely due culture--- people basically locked apartments anyways. nicknamed “bat woman” expeditions bat caves, described Covid-19 February 2020 paper, saying 96.2% similar coronavirus sample named RaTG13 obtained Yunnan 2013.

The nickname bit seems jarringly low quality journalism, 96.2% sounds rather distant me. I'm bat woman virologist, knows. they're marking either pneumonia labeling other. 

Remember, like data, gotta reclassify something approve. Won’t long Bezos starts lol long extrapolate experience happening Tampa Bay. I’ve come conclusion one flaw modern society overridden self selection left us 30% population dummies. Samples sent Quest collected viral transport media frozen. Frozen samples good awhile. Plus assays use DNA detection, virus need alive detected. lot Quest samples send get called positive least week earlier. work lab covid testing. Helps explain rapid spread Arizona degree. summer rarely go out. Hard want leave climate controlled space it’s 110°+ outside. ""It spreads easier club!"" ""It spreads club!""

That probably close quarters, lack social distancing, re-circulation air via air conditioners. No. I’ve isolated worn masks since February. see half state shouting lives matter, distancing wearing masks. us fought keep safe shouldn’t punished blatantly not. don’t keep safe, one designating life doesn’t matter. Try gaslighting someone else. Reddit. It’s impossible. People get America-bashing somehow. virus weird. swabbed man yesterday turned negative sleeping bed wife whose sick week. daughter came father tested positive. literally skips people. One thing I've noticed leaders states response Covid terrible people complain. strong leadership people complain strict. maybe, instead trying rely compliance general population, generally cary little risk serious complications Covid... Instead lock people environments exposed risk?

Seat belts great, letting blind people drive cars better risk mitigation. Air bags also great, letting drunk people drive cars effective.

Masks likely positive effect (and purely biological downside, certainly agree), real solution count general public's compliance, instead focus risk mitigation efforts populations risk.

Lock elderly care facilities. Focus providing home delivery essentials conditions appear risk factors. Provide financial support working poor choice show ""essential"" jobs.

There many ways target mitigation efforts here, relying every Karen mask (especially mask component really well understood specifically w/r/t Covid), shortest, simplest, cheapest road risk mitigation. becoming big problem. People need stop jumping conclusions. There’s bunch American plates around house they’re practically legitimately allowed here. responding meme. Unfortunately, can’t get accurate test it’s option. really sure guess. school going back indoors , masks distancing . pushed back start date hopefully public outcry make change minds ""Corona virus disease like virus sent Wuhan 2013""

Yeah, that. Coronaviruses around now. Remember SARS? BC, Canada average age dead 86. 

According CDC 50 99.95+% chance survival. 50 64; 99.8%.

COVID kills old people flu, far fewer young people. Two issues this:

One - military force vastly vastly larger anything American citizens could muster.
Two - people guns support want provide citizens money think haux dems One study suggests. again. don’t know, definitely don’t know accept kids lost year pandemic, hold back kids repeat year post vaccine. 

Eliminate taxes reduce obligation 2020.

Provide masks Americans month mandate must used. Fines bad virus came Europe Well thing requirement fines noted nearly everyone would follow. Much like going speed limit speed limit. Sure instances anti masker range ages around I've seen deal get however needs done. That's I'm saying....the insurance company pay full amount. Ever. half gets adjusted off.

They stated able quarantine students dorms, food things don’t believe work. There's lot infrastructure needed support people flooding areas. Bathrooms, grocery stores, restaurants bars going tons people should. People traveling over, traveling back thier homes. Actually going beach small part ""beach weekend"" I've turned away places wearing *nice enough* shirt even. know did? fucking respected dress code made sure jacket next time. Thank !! helps explain ! I’m trying vigilante, feel almost feels inevitable get even you’re absolute best . people disgusting. They’re kids ffs Where's infinity stones need them? point smokers non-mask wearers need stay tf away me, got it. That's said next time, smart ass. &amp; arrest people negligently kill people giving Coronavirus. New York's lockdown came two months spreading completely undetected. working bad information virus transmits treat it.

People need get New York comparisons. exact conditions exist anymore. southern western US outbreaks plenty bad own. realize people incarcerated good compared alternative lol, China many murder harvest organs..... USA need prison reform, China needs human rights reform. racist disgusting, everyone course, China awful black people, muslims, pretty much anyone Han Chinese. people locked compare organ harvesting, nice try though! Yeah, people make smallest adjustments lives even best people. hope someone taking care pets. Except knew 6 months ago Baseball actually pretty high risk activity that’s saying much nurse it’s sounds like every nurse know Philadelphia. Yea everyone vigilant back March kicked off. now? It’s basically back normal 90% people. PACU typically capacity similar equipment ICU. top this, PACU nurses often former experienced ICU nurses, leave PACU better hours. visual person, helps see figures like chart form, this: http://owo.whats-th.is/9zWMqiX.png get passing moderately social democratic policy actively shitting bed key issues, somehow made Canada international champion progress.

I frequently find explaining international friends country really progressive, contrast US. IFR near zero 35 under. 
Your IFR numbers way off. don’t think avg age person ICU hospitalization young. data?

Hospitals filling way people COVID get tested, like 10x 30x more. Per CDC country experts blood tests.  Nah. Tomorrow day following Sunday holiday weekend. Tuesday Saturday next week big numbers hit. 2 3 weeks hell breaks loose call state reps demand police reform along immediate shelter place order. Thank suggestion. Endemic prairie dogs I'm talking 4 Tampa hospitals. nationwide study 2014.

For example Texas Med Center headlines getting capacity, also capacity last year June.

They 1,300 ICU beds...that's ton ppl.

One Tampa hospitals Palms Paradise full capacity 18.......18!!! bad bus crash could fill up. operate justice system revenge system. entitled death cruel unusual. entitled appeals operate system laws. Many people come death row years even decades later DNA evidence evidence exonerates them. celebrating person's death. ^^^^^^This guy right here! gets it!^^^^^^^® Masks don’t block oxygen carbon dioxide. seen people wearing outside one sight. 

Except... you? Seeing them? You’re sight. 

I’d protect you, too. idiots gone. ones continuously put us position. know protesting right isn’t probably best thing do....... haven’t seen much social distancing mask wearing. saying.... Theres reason folk tend vote R

R-tarded Warnings.. Ha.. america, first warning shot always aimed foot. certainly deserved every moment suffering. many things frustrated about. get it, people can't SIP forever lack federal response crippling. somewhere stay home indefinitely WIDE OPEN, saf(er) medium could hitting. Beaches, hiking, outdoor beer gardens? OK. Bars, clubs? Hell no.  That’s double Canada cases. really got nerves March/April , can't stand I'm going go head assume Floridian. No, none places exception Miami even come close number beach visitors year. Pinellas County 35 miles beach, amazing millions visitors year. 

My statement though Clearwater Beach possibly visited beach America mean island Clearwater Beach 2.5 miles beach adjacent beaches. singular location second maybe Myrtle Beach. drive across bridge onto island take hour half sometimes. ferries run constantly mainland line hour. call Disney Beach reason. tacky shit hole packed million idiot tourists given day year. 3-year-old managing okay recently. understands (at least little bit) people sick that’s can’t go daycare see friends. wasn’t past week she’s really seemed depressed it, actually crying can’t play kids. She’s child. 

We’re going start arranging outdoor-only play dates friends know taking seriously. Feel guilty start worry long term effects keeping isolated long. decision IMO. one's encouraging it.

She's said (privately far) stand around open school. Also willing put family risk either.

And said would understand return well.

We'll see decides decisions get made. Oof that's short turn around. there’s still quite difference us chimps.

I don’t know, anti-mask crowd seems pretty close TWO WEEKS. husband trying tell hospitals California actually empty. reports doctors trying make hospital LOOK overcrowded! 

Like.  really think rapid. think deciding reopen indoor restaurants past week good move. think moving rapidly decision changed. Someone needs send memo covid avoid death row inmates Better playing Canada. argue die. STOP. want us stop, call state reps demand police reform. Temps bit harder prove, also statistics sunlight. However, pretty simple logic chain show helps (just much). UV sterilizes things, sunlight contains plenty UV, therefore sunlight sterilizing effect.

As said, large question long takes. One 10 people Boston antibodies early two months ago. Going way higher now: Except never big number. Unless cound numbers 40s huge news Somebody sue Desantis Yes. Duh. Plus think look cool, dont fake damn smile anymore. Frigan great.  hospitals overflow pneumonia patients? Germany also four times many people, lol. goes show bad America’s response been. Friendly reminder still several areas US access high speed, reliable internet. Hey look everyone guy speaks entire state Georgia! that's impressive. almost certainly lower that. formula makes lot simplifying assumptions know true, notably everyone unexposed equally susceptible.

It's useful vaccination campaigns trying administer vaccine broadly possible. virus burn naturally usually require much lower number, although one would rather reach. Yeah really doesnt sound like good idea all. Goodness people common sense. Multiple studies show virus breaks UV light, point primary method many healthcare systems were/are disinfecting large amounts PPE (my wife HCW use harsh UV light cleaner phone/keys part decom ritual gets home day work).

Here's sources sunlight/UV light look through:

[Airborne SARS-CoV-2 Rapidly Inactivated Simulated 


[Simulated Sunlight Rapidly Inactivates SARS-CoV-2 


Inteview Paul Dabisch, senior research scientist Department Homeland Security’s biodefense research laboratory: ""[Initial lab tests show sunlight, higher temperatures humidity hurdles survival 


[Increasing Temperature Relative Humidity Accelerates Inactivation SARS-CoV-2 agree you. don’t think criminally enforceable without actual evidence. People family die open eyes....and still doubt it. Given brutality senselessness crime, hope quick. Although I’m surprised, missed point entirely. Ok boomer. According Trump, 99% cases harmless. What’s panic? /s. Keep drinking Kool-aid red states. False. military better weapons military can't every place once. Also, taking LA county example, +10 million people live there. LA state, would 7th largest state United States population-wise. 

I think really need understand size scale things make statements grounded reality. Case point, 70% US economy based consumer confidence consumer spending. lot going covid continuing gain ground every state US. Further, end month sweet sweet pandemic UI expires moratorium evictions expire. something soon e.g. extending it, creating new round funding, going see quickly world's sole super power turn country like Venezuela. know fit narrative America is, true. like flat Earther says world flat. Sorry, not. boat, stimulus check either. People jail entitled protected. government must provide food shelter adequate healthcare. fact died virus even though they're death row nothing joyful about. entitled appeals. entitled painless death illness drown bodily fluids. happened cruel unusual unconstitutional. point justice system torture people, even guilty horrible monsters mind deserve it. Eh feel reopening pace reasonable. NJ feel good job monitoring cases. delayed reopening indoor dining Murphy won’t hesitate scale things back gets worse. It’s never going perfect. need contain it. live Florida county lead daily cases times since reopening. mandated anything yet. also work local municipality starting see positive tests come workforce (including related deaths). one full day mandated wear masks rescinded. quoted DeSantis guidance mask mandate lifted.

My kid really good school two guaranteed entry bc older sibling. wife considering taking child school virtual school August. rest schools area failing schools. many hard decisions make right ones made earlier. Didn’t New York Texas build temporary hospitals got torn used? didn’t see single patient. Wasted millions? surprises you? Look recent mutation posts here...mutation isn’t new, Europe back Feb/March even NY March. It’s like they’re recycling articles point Think who's sickman now. mean. dream. problem America people fear. proud mask fight clerks it. shame almost stores area least security. Calling police option takes 10-15 minutes clerk employee bad situation Texas hospitals treat nurses like crap. Even without covid19 overworked underpaid. 

It take much crap many say FU, need this... Especially reason extreme stress people separate and/or wear masks. 

Who wants risk lives, lives family/friends, incur medical bills jerk hang friends beach bar? New white house rules.

Rules sentence noun, verb. New rules white house Loopholes often intentional. read backtracked first statement deaths reported say reported ppe spare. go without. DIRECT contact polluted air. Wearing mask outside afraid catching virus absurd me...especially one next you. I’ve seen people wearing outside one sight. That’s letting fear take control extreme. Like said get crowded environment outside want take precautions. Give two weeks...when portion people start showing symptoms suddenly great concern. literally not. told concerns personal experiences. act like ever happen. Which, news flash, do. 

Again, basis social workers ""trained professionals"" better? Explain it. already talked police officers de-escalation better known crisis intervention techniques. without throwing temper tantrum flaming me, explain it. call bullshit see getting upset. good news right mask manatees went affect two weeks ago sorry leveling kit Jay days. Hopefully continues Wednesday sure know helping Yeah really need stay home. save money next year maybe stay longer things normally able do. fucking serious? entirety Africa? neighboring states opened Chicago, many Chicagoan travelled drink party. Chicago subreddit least week since March, someone ask “what’s open? want plan Chicago trip week!” Implying state. Americans dumb AF. single person thread disagreed you’re acting like highest stakes argument you’ve ever in.

Of course cops shoot black people time get even slightly startled arrested charged. right there’s multiple crises unfolding time, seem believe 1 taken consideration. Dude live Sweden, healthcare system sucks, approach sucked, one thing sure lie numbers got one impress lower higher true cases. makes sense, thank you! sure works. agree ""shouldn't."" Yeah. seem lot evidence protests responsible much spread.

Masks + outside seems pretty safe. 

I expected much worse. 

On hand, bars, restaurants, house parties ... knew going awful evidence continues show us are, fact, awful. work hospital close full. know county are. might mistaken Hillsborough Pinellas (a neighboring county). reading this? 10k+ cases day Florida schools supposed open month? Central Florida starting blow now. going disaster. I'm sending kids current outbreak. Online is! Nah. never butthurt comes citizens sick man Asia. 🤣 Even treated early (late treatment helpful) least virulent form (bubonic, pneumonic 70% 80% mortality septicemic 95% mortality early treatment) still 10-15% mortality. surprisingly considering 60% (probably more, we're sure) mortality without treatment. something plague pandemic 2017 remind us yersinia pestis always taken seriously! SJSU D1, I'm sure others. doubt athletics factor, UCs research-oriented, larger, expensive I'm almost certain factors (including professional schools like law, med, vet, etc.) ordered face shield wear mask goggles. Bring headaches. Wooooo working overtime? test samples nationwide area? Yeah Russell County literally nowhere enforced mask wearing. Even damn local dmv 19 ppl small building right became mandatory workers telling wear mask. Ppl see numbers county low think hoax.

Interestingly one friends came seemed like textbook covid symptoms, got back negative health department basically beg test her. went hospital next day conditions worsened refused test covid. read comment someone willing spend money mask. went totally way. I've pre-ordered two $40 Armour performance masks two $20 masks wicking fabric face-side. anticipate ending time soon, money can't spend restaurants going towards comfort. Yes. Making sure vulnerable people shielded greatest extent possible, building extra ICU capacity ASAP, encourage social distancing, mass wearing.

Also accepting fact tragedy, tragic deaths, times hospital systems going overwhelmed. system isn’t designed enough spare capacity hit fast spreading nasty virus crops century. need adapt mitigate whatever damage possible without shutting everything, something unsustainable, miserable destructive. Oh make sure we’re better prepared next pandemic. Even they’re guilty, constitution prohibits cruel unusual punishment.  Anything generate headline. east coast got European mutation west coast China version. late. people used wearing masks, time start pushing real masks like N95 KN95. saw woman yesterday sheer, see-through scarf pulled nose bandido style. hell good going do? virus airborne, socks going protect you. Masks voluntary Georgia public schools, too. course was, nothing Dr. Orange making look like something could pat back taking “early action”.

I’ll dig around bit, believe remember seeing one huge loophole brilliant plan...there’s nothing stopping someone China really wanted get states going Europe first flying America there. students need go dining hall, food mean. well go buy snacks furniture dorm room. Collective sigh relief

Interesting little terrifying. change fact stated many ICU patients 18 13 possible Covid though. leisure industries allowed continue operating? risky protest injustices open people go bars restaurants? Cambodia Tourists: agree developed world contributing, look Japan, doesn’t mean it’s problem. normally it’s famine stuff, tend come rescue humanitarian efforts. last time saw something like famine totally decimate population? problem population continue prop up. system untenable.

Laughable? demonstrable fact decision test suspected cases kept case counts artificially low.

[I made graph awhile back showing daily totals appear late March changed testing people suspected virus testing people needed hospitalised belonged ""risk groups"" showed symptoms. early June changed back testing people showed mild symptoms even risk group.

You clearly see ""plateau"" data starts ends change limited testing.

It undeniable number cases reported day kept low due lack testing, testing kept limited good reason - within couple weeks changing criteria early June, number tests performed tripled, showing always capacity test people.

Were ""faking"" data? Maybe directly, intentionally undercounting simply refusing test majority suspected cases.  feel pain. saddest thing schools become daycare children. system changed one parent works one looks everything else. Giving equal opportunities (which I'm totally for) made system partners work, simply possible support family one salary anymore (even highly skilled worker). Covid shown fragility system also wages kept inflation since 80s. Oh someone says has... consumer price index include rent luxury good tampons.... 15 minutes me. Absolutely disturbing. ""Florida Man"" essentially Patient Zero. Spreading stupidity, apathy, arrogance resentment populace ""great"" state Florida. People ""YOLO"" generally ones going hospital. remember established march already february seeing first people get sick, people older co-workers, parents, grandparents. go stores interact employees who'll things ""re-open."" can't get herd immunity without many people age 50 getting sick. 

Remember, herd immunity 70% COVID. dream situation: outbreaks nursing facilities, outbreaks grocery stores, people infect parents despite trying keep safe things, people think they're strong die COVID take precautions. 

Hundreds thousands millions people would need die us reach herd immunity, many countries already going back normal successfully beaten COVID. mention, many people die substantial long-term effects. Caring shows you’re ‘shitbag’. Raise good person you’re definitely net positive world. 

I know mean. son birthday lockdown. feel awful him. big party. first real summer riding around neighborhood kids... instead it’s inside almost day.

There positives well. used spend 2 half hours commuting, wiped got home. work home, lunch w family immediately get work. (There’s secret part enjoying lockdown) Right???? Rules letter law ass lol. He's trying cover his. remember reading lives around 6 hours soft surfaces. 
Sorry don’t source, please fact check Aren’t Canadians like, polite, generally look out/care one another? Don’t also tend politicize things like masks buy ridiculous conspiracy theories? mean granted I’m sure do, overall majority? might something much better they’re right now. 

Thank God Canada, they’re reason might get hockey back month. got downvoted laughing ""longhauler"" said drawn blood consistency chocolate pudding. 

This sub lost cause. tech student say kemp illegitimate governor along USG bunch buffoons Coming back densely populated metro area north, trying find silver linings. Florida historic two negatives could spun positives would help limit contagion: first, severely limitied public transit infrastructure. thing. Miami-Dade, example, residents use cars get around. metro joke buses make commute worse, without real cost-benefit. NYC millions people transit systems day. thousands crammed metro per hour, inevitable death numbers NYC peaked way did. One sneeze covid boogers hand rails spread hundreds. 

Second, low density, urban sprawl. Also pre-covid weakness, could plus Florida. makes places like Miami unwalkable terrible outside downtown. fact socially distant. 

However, weeks wear on, State's inherent YOLOness, Trumper-ism, historically limited access healthcare, high rates poverty, inequality racism, corruption, ineptitude, leadership obsessed reaping possible rewards sun rather fixing shit broken (Rick Scott dismantled everything pieces profit around time left) sinking State. dead piling yet, sum Florida's weaknesses pretty much guarantees do, even inaccurately reported. Meanwhile, /Clearwater sub, people keep asking go clubbing go eat come visit. Okay? mom’s basement. source shows 52% 30-44 year-olds plan wear masks time likely wear masks 6% likely.

It's young people old people. ignorant people. I'm sure does, that's type situation I'd much rather air come valve system extra filtration able exhale easily. Point is, n95s them, don't. That's much modern thing.

But still, could told us use scarves, shirts, cloth whatever sort, would done it. spelled anecdotal wrong, case spelled “experience”. carry on.

Fuck traitor. 

You obviously idea American. 

You're ignorant, wonder trump loves stupid uneducated, believe anything, traitor. foreigner actually rich country. outside, looks like third world country dollars big rich set ups. Like Cayman Islands Moscow, Russia. Sharing border Nevada, Arizona, TJ help. Deaths aren’t reported real-time, lagging well behind indicators like hospitalizations ICU capacity.

AZDHS reporting deaths come signed, filed death certificate explicitly states COVID cause death. We’re also using limited testing supply people already died, 5 people care home die symptoms, one got positive test, one COVID death reported state.

Send reminder two weeks now, go back AZDHS dashboard look day. You’ll see death count gone up, state receives files proper death certificates. Death count AZ past Tuesday 88, last Tuesday 79. Given AZ 7 million population, would call big count. Good her, rare. Stay well &amp; sane lol... daughter likes ""train stick fighting"" (She mostly beats got bunch bruises already \*snicker\*) asked several times take stick us leave home ... username checks out, doctor? opened early, PHASES REOPENING. course, places really shutdown offices retail.

Since banned travel China, virus found alternate route Italy NY rest US.

If banned travel Europe, would eventually traveled China California rest US China NY rest US.

By time started banning travel, already clear signs community infection. would stop new infections coming overseas. testing places saying expect delays due huge numbers testing coming in. I’m hoping get shit together, testing infrastructure breaks down, may see 20k/day anytime soon. increasing hospitalizations. kids partying beaches old immunocompromised people occupying beds. 

Thats issue along. aren’t protecting masks lockdowns, (failing at) protecting vulnerable among us. 

I’ve home away friends going nuts 50 year parents, mom Lupus dad myriad cardiovascular issues. **I** going meeting people, **I** wearing mask distancing, **I** also go risk grocery trips need eat. even one person grocery store whose bar gathering beach touches something comes close without mask, effort four months potentially vain. mistake, asshole’s. Nope, Americans much worse average. Americans more, USA big country, various social networks bigger stronger, sending information (bad good) stronger signal... humans anywhere tend follow group (""going viral""). Yes, help informational networks easily hacked misinformation due existing marketing channels, that's problem places now. 

Take anti-vaxxers example. new phenomenon, they've around long time many places World; variety conspiracy theories vaccinations. took Americans getting it, amplify it, get ""trending"" cause global movement dangerous dipshits (just wait COVID-19 vaccines). 

tl.dr.; easier get Critical Mass Americans many culture organized know original post replying said, Trump deserve credit here. study right, analysis that's big if, he's right sheer dumb luck. federal proposal Iowa proposal? matters much, see McConnell voting passing something completely unacceptable harming. see Iowa leadership anything either, near top ladder dear leader's ass. making compulsory allowing damn exceptions. one children age 2 run risk suffocation. health condition prevents wearing amask plenty things allow stay home away people. That's insurance companies treated back 90s. single migraine twenties brain tumor 50s they'd find way connect two cover treatment. Pregnancies considered pre-existing. Insurance companies everything pay bill. they've got lawyers spend years spending lawyers make sure happens. Arizona statewide ""surge line"" hospital ICU beds, transfer patient another hospital does, patient's insurance treat in-network. sister said they've flown patients Tucson Kingman get ICU bed.

Makes sense terms NYC spring upsurge. There's probably Europeans coming going NY metro area anywhere world. something herd. ""It kills old people""

Like know old people?? parents/grandparents?? support Black Lives Matter needs stop moment, right time now, also black people disproportionately affected virus. need pause, stay home social distance, things get better go back demand justice. problem &amp; true ...follow happiness &amp; mind &amp; gut instincts...lol even though makes difficult. anxious start getting experience could also look online tutoring etc. would good keep game, helpful families etc. know state PA, allowed start tutoring college junior year right student teaching. may plenty opportunities. getting emails special ed agencies line sessions. thought~ Good luck!!!! test positive I'm telling everyone.

LMFAO build wall! Employers, landlords, etc., too. Yeah, really dont get it. anal sex blowjobs friends want use actual science hit 1300 7/2 two days hit lows 200 370. basically hospital capacity tells people. Go home rest. remember earlier pandemic saying common NSAIDs like Advil Sodium naproxen may make infection worse I’m sure turned true Yeah! Unless it’s fruit veggies, wash those. FlOo Wikipedia media disagrees lol 7 day rolling average death counts AZ gone 16, 21, 32 37 past 4 weeks. Please look data posting misinforming message. part that’s got seriously worried. New York, saw spike shutdown happened. shutdown probably effective anywhere US fresh scary coronavirus time. cases kept rising *weeks*. didn’t really even hospitals slammed month shutdown. 

Now here’s Florida. Spikes, hospitals overwhelmed, 10k+ positives day. Still shutdown. that, governor getting TV saying shit handled won’t shut again.

I know conditions aren’t exactly same, maybe won’t get bad, New York trend holds true them, bad could get them? mean going try take peoples freedom live die virus? outrage? Yes GA sent time. I’m really curious surveys exactly same. Agreed. Glad insurance stepped woman, still need address outrageous hospital bill, everyone going pay higher insurance premiums.. we’re screwed markups costs. Take look graph behold spike year: stores enforce rules shits shoes. enforce rules buy alcohol tobacco. can’t enforce masks?

It’s lack societal pressure. leaders promoting masks modeling good behavior, vast majority population board, would problem get last 10-15% comply. people weren’t applauded social circles defying mask orders, would problem. 

The political right turned science political issue. Solve issue whole mask issue resolved. Moats around city! (That good analogy dilemma) 

My answer 100 Skittles dilemma:

Hell no! one, would eat skittles! Hedge bet side safety. Eat NONE 100 Skittles, even though 1 posion, gives 100 odds getting poisoned. least, pertains tainted Skittles. saying cases proportional population? Lmao Correct. also don’t need spoon fed information. Massive spike reported Covid cases followed crowded ICU’s. Pretty clear B follows A. Strangely enough district GA sent survey, heavily skewed questions toward person instruction. Results damn near ratios shown here. two options, virtual academy enrolls separate virtual school person instruction. Besides Plexiglass /u/MeisterX mentioned, also cheaper [Chinese approach using plastic sheet 

Though Plexiglass/acrylic sturdier, one airtight used together acrylic. thought supposed listen scientists, politicians? subreddit confusing. dumb way ""American""? yeah everyone bragging wonderful family time actually forced spend time them. Well mean small medium amount good time consuming like 10 grams instance force deep introspective thought processes. mean literally forces meditative trance quantity.  China controls British scientist? ain't wrong I'm ya, Poconos, family NJ. Heard Allegheny county shut indoor dining/bars etc. temporarily due spikes. feel like Wolf done average job, we'll see he's willing quickly revert green counties surges start up, especially staters coming holiday. all, people need alcohol. herd immunity 70% COVID

That's question - Covid peaked started fizzle hit 20% Sweden (only place look allowed blaze).  Uh, video r/trashy yesterday woman 60s sitting ground mask looped around one ear told put mask. see plenty older people comorbidities without masks, can't say much integrity hope vote. wish acted better judgement used acts humanity better democracy.

But let's honest -- logical consistency. particular side wanting cake eat too. Gathering large crowds outside pandemic irresponsible, unless protest something *they* believe in. Nah Honestly nobody does. heard many stories Uber/Lyft drivers treated like dirt. don’t look service providers people anymore... it’s huge problem likely worsened way use technology interact other. Sometimes ‘progress’ isn’t really worth cost.

Svt:  


So newly admitted patients top mid April, going since. 


Or talking increase positive tests? 
There increase number tests done (swedish, sorry):

  


Tests week 22: 36 466 Tests week 26: 75 151 
 increase cases mild cases, serious cases: 5, figur 1c: ""Lime green"" mild (""Lindriga""), Purple Serious (""Alvarliga""). 


So number cases going down, shown ICU tests. could add non ICU hospitalizations want. never closed lol Nice, enjoy sun guys! Talk next life! Trump: terrible plague China warned Beijing must held accountable!

Yup, US rolling average gone every one four weeks, exactly said. long takes. Which, looking countries outside US would soon America solipsistic. 

For creative solutions, top head: Virtual gatherings? Better masks? Actually wearing masks first place? Closing main streets turning beer gardens / patios/ pedestrian malls. Rethinking gather, spaces gather in, what's socially appropriate, ways recognizes new need distance. Thats huge different northeast opening slowly taking serious. Everyone around wheres mask. brother south said like virus doesnt exist one wears mask. add fact good percentage people anti-vax anti-mask? may pretty screwed anyway.

I honestly hope begin requiring even COVID &amp; flu shots students, teachers, etc. possible this. Testing free US now. People always telling love numbers. Boots da fur! rediculous comical may, really depends likelihood airborne spread. Knowing happen happened different knowing likely happen. real kicker balance information necessity continue economic activity. governments could force everyone homes indefinitely would certainly stop spread virus, would come far worse cost. Public health agencies need balance need economic activity need stop virus. Ashamed say never occurred wow... excellent point. millions recovered Covid cases there. look them. No, all. apparently topic confuses lot people. fact still know lot multiple ways transmission. despite title, subject we're 100% (or 60%) sure about.

At point scientist able make parts picture visible, also lot missing parts puzzle. One major things know yet, many *virus* need get infected, (exactly) there's apparent huge variety much viral load needed get infected different groups people. Umm.. report him, especially given jobs could spread lot people normal non-compliance person. NYS department Health would far ass, regret ever going first place.

Like literally family forced 14 day quarantine face stiff fines. he's stupid learn others, let empties teaching him. I’m hoping spotlight fact hospitals tend full non-pandemic times. plenty studies quick google search. 

Now, imagine strain puts health system shut three months deny elective surgeries. allow elective surgeries/hospital care begin again, there’s huuuuuge backlog, plus current people need surgeries/hospital care whatever reason day day basis, plus... Covid. 

If see “overwhelmed hospitals” Texas “surging” states, it’s this. refusing standard elective surgeries hospital care normal, created mess.

Nothing article shows strong indication IFR Japan significantly lower New York whatever. could double strip club extra $$$ THEORY people actually taking seriously would much, much worse much, much quicker.

Literally seeing things get worse means measures put place WORKING. 

Is coincidence slowly, state entered phases reopening, cases started climb? No. Without active measures going get worse. get hardon it. want cases go down. realistic looking president Governor FL downplaying every turn, saying completely control every statistic shows otherwise, etc. going get worse likely. mistake, Marmot. Well Netherlands UK current plans involve distancing teachers students data points towards risky part schools staff rooms No, HEPA filtration isnt wildly expensive. nearly expensive medical services needed treat extra cases otherwise. HIV around 40 years people still unprotected sex strangers ""they look sick"".

There always large percentage population learn things hard way. There's substantial lag reporting deaths cases infections, takes time new spike register new cases, even time deaths associated spike recorded. case-fatality rate underestimate long we're exponential growth phase. closed... wondering whether nation's medical spending going less pandemic. ultimately inform whether insurance premiums go up.

On one hand, course major expenses associated dealing novel virus. No-brainer.

But lockdown means fewer elective procedures. Fewer people out-and-about getting car accidents. Fewer sports injuries. People canceling minor doctor visits.

What think? course. Arrest cops killed Breona Taylor arrest people killed someone negligently giving Coronavirus. Honestly, didn’t ask either though.  Holiday weekend reporting always wonky. could actually read article way should, look citations. quote cited understand people citing Perspective article (published April 1 NEJM.org)1 support discrediting widespread masking. truth, intent article push masking, less. apparent many people SARS-CoV-2 infection asymptomatic presymptomatic yet highly contagious people account substantial fraction transmissions.2,3 Universal masking helps prevent people spreading virus-laden secretions, whether recognize infected not.4

Unsurprisingly, article says exact opposite claiming. I’m Georgia resident.

Not making distinction could fatal. one states little enforced SD mask wearing.

Some businesses force customers wear masks. bad people keep nose. even get started people take mask talk...

Last Tuesday, friend (sitting right next him) decided tell us sick. not. eating, mask one. 

Found yesterday tested positive COVID. symptoms. 

I signed test eighth. question: isolating, still go store anywhere else mask? I’m groceries. 

Also, saw older grandparents day know (both I). social distanced there, mask (they told to) hugs anything. however touch phone SO’s hand (she said friend). Well seeing brought *you* world, yes, help.

If testing stays strong, people know / people quarantine / people slow spread vs. April didnt well. 


But, without vaccine, practically every human catch eventually Whataboutisms straw man arguments. I'm impressed fallacies used. Maybe locked folks outside, allows exitting (in case fire, etc.)? like that, like applied number infected. must least online portion make class completely doable online,

I understand works disciplines require hands components specialized equipment. teach music. woodwinds class canceled safe play woodwind instruments person, teach beginners nuances embouchure hand position tiny screen, fix instrument working? Supposedly teach spring still going on? kids need graduate, plan band directors. course, still going may need band directors while. already put forth argument police greatly defunded. went ""nuh uh,"" patted back smart. feel free suck much big dick want join you. Social workers trained professionals better equipped handle social crises paperwork police officers, trained view public enemy shoot first ask questions later, end story. Probably people want work person raped killed others. Even become bit better.

But that's still stupid wasteful. need group bunch criminals team, send deadly firefight mission. even name team. shirt shoes requirement.

That's law. update argument light fact wrong? keep calling people idiots **you** know facts? fact, U.S. state law requiring restaurant patrons wear Thanks response. We've used fmla past know thinking this. think Iowa like PA getting UI benefits 5 weeks canceled summer school usually works. hope extend UI benefits longer end July. Good idea~ Georgia resident here. mom teacher everyone terrified go back work there’s nothing do. makes think believe it’s hoax? havent seen mom 3 months self quarantine. Yes, need college degree see rising infections hospitalizations mean deaths coming. number people got last weekend, buying shit July 4 parties. 

more likely last weekend, maybe June 20th 4. virus evolved something less deadly contagious? Horses donkeys produce offspring they’re clearly species (I mean, different number chromosomes, they’ve drifted apart quite bit). Another example cattle produce offspring bison, also clearly different species.

But offspring sterile, offspring humans neanderthals Neanderthal Denisovan genes different enough considered separate species within genus Homo. 

But different genes be, order another species?

TBH metter choice.

To criterion ""can produce offsprong, produce offspring members either group"", better criterion.

If shared say 99.9999999% genes, small difference made impossible procreate together, I'd say different species, even though would similar.  need people issue fines. dont think fair expect clerk get yelled spit patron doesnt wear mask. police stores security certainly. 18 year old supposed 35 year old anti-masker. Let tell you, asking someone wear mask nicely work around here. haven’t used FB year now. keep friend mine plays live music garage every Friday. Otherwise it’s forgotten. People always ask saw post message always answer “huh?”

It feels wonderful. Sure, 50 states governed centralized government duty ensure people’s health safety. Chores responsibilities forced take care another living say desire bringing life. Teenage years school, learning socialize productive member society. take care parents’ mistakes. August? christ sakes, tomorrow's Fourth July open business. best summer we've ever had. concerned beaches to, make safe. beaches open weekend.

- Larry Vaughn, unofficial Florida COVID 19 response manager give someone Coronavirus negligent die, killed them. That’s accident, considered negligent homicide. apologize human. know little crazy get type tent like make kids bigger lol...or room divider something signals ""no kid zone""...google ideas families situation come make less stressful??? Best luck!!!! honest, that’s something thought US wasn’t taking COVID seriously. kills bunch elderly disabled people, that’s less Medicare, Medicaid, social security goes - saving money long term. absolutely believe current leadership 100% totally fine that. it’s absolutely depressing heartbreaking. Lives reduced money. saw huge parties neighborhood yesterday. Like groups 50+. going surge 100,000s easily couple weeks ""Death Row inmate dies""
Money time saved, I'd say. answer yes. Yes wear type face covering mouth nose. video 5 months old outdated information. Go back basement sooo many people thread giving people shit going beaches all. doesn’t help governor downplaying severity, said outbreak due illegal immigrant workers, said absolutely shutting Florida second time. No, that’s already included testing. avg still 35, even older infect included. 

If mean, go infect old people. Maybe, likely infect young people. 

Either way, avg infected stays young, deaths won’t follow big way.  Cuz prolly one charge honestly don’t care agree. always meet friends fun wearing masks staying apart. black white people? article course suggest smoking good idea. may aspect smoking, hypothesized nitric oxide, may help COVID-19. survives forced air HVAC filters, heat exchangers ducting debate masks over. 100% agree. statement response felt generalized statement individualism inferior collectivism. certain circumstances (pandemic, war, etc) collectivism much effective. certainly think messaging federal (and certain state) government media caused effective mitigation steps become politicized US. Might last  $4000 still reasonable. live area amount people think wearing mask giving freedoms frightening. refuse look facts push conspiracies masks cause harm good friend took two oldest kids Texas week because”flights cheap”. don’t understand. that's lock Old news knew sense feb Yeah property taxes joke definitely promote.  also allow people sit empty plots land middle cities creates mess itself.  Ugly for, also breaks city creates barriers within it.

This property condominium, paying heft condo fees though.  seem take expenses add onto price property... restaurant case study air conditioning natural ventilation. Open windows okay air exchanged outside air. slow spread. prevents even one infection effect. question, much. mean higher death toll? think ourcasesinmarch april came from? Everyone returning vacation! best way stop spread stay least 6 feet human beings 

The 6 feet rule makes little sense indoors virus spreads via aerosols linger air hours. toss rule right window people wearing masks building poor ventilation. Huh?

My source John Hopkins. IFR people 50 whole way less 1% Ireland we've set alcohol served substantial meal people hour half pub. meal attempt soak alcohol people get shitfaced, week people already acting bollocks. There's false sense security low numbers.

Also thanks misinformation conspiracies big pharma etc, without doubt people infected refuse get tested take precautions. Add alcohol public place mindset recipe disaster. ""Droplets"" include airborne particles. It’s job die? Fuck dude. r/cringtopia sub start c color scheme. went expecting something funny saying “fuck” loud. interesting. link credible source? Even mandated standardized guidance things, see compliance thrown window, especially kids teachers, parents, staff, etc involved may wholeheartedly believe cause.

It’s tough situation put parents though, schools essentially daycare there’s way around it. anti mask idiots rounded placed camps cure found. I’m teacher Florida. return August 5th lol many people vacationing bring back home states. Yay! I'm assumung people infected never direct contact positive covid-19 case, rode elevator them. know happen aerosol viruses, measles. Ok Northern Hemisphere almost buildings engineered sealed possible make heating efficient newer building tighter seals up. far filtration goes unless filters grab still making petri dish office spaces. I’m saying it’s glorified daycare, many parents do. love teaching working kids. also know reality world, many parents simply don’t care. I’ve helped parents soccer practice Boy Scouts, I’ve taught classes kids art center. It’s always same. Parents use activities like cheaper alternative daycare. thing applies school system, unfortunately. People aren’t worried education (although are), parents mainly worried paying babysitters they’re work. School certainly cheapest option is. want person guidelines absolutely cannot follow. way keep schools safe. want die, I'm high risk, job, tell come back feel choice without becoming homeless. can't sleep night I'm depressed this. don’t KNOW anything all. It’s assumptions based sounds plausible. Head Jersey shore. fuck ton NY/NYC. masks, noone cares. Like normal, everything goes window shore. Full trash. I’d argue it’s actually worst wear mask like that. I’m doctor scientist, yet wonder pulling mask nose allows breath water droplets trapped outside mask could likely cause infection one wouldn’t gotten proper mask usage. scientist thoughts? Big true US many hospitals used CDC's early classification Droplet excuse decrease amount PPE issued. large difference Droplet Airborne precautions way could say actually need N95 masks gowns taking care covid+ patients receiving aerosolized treatments. Man can't figure ones I'm supposed drink ones I'm not. confusing. ninth rule: wear mask. Oh add beds, totally right there. can't care people them. No, America failed state. Tennessee well. We're keeping kids home. They're older, well online setup, work school, go back work soon. I'm sorry hope stay well. Accept people said polypropylene annealed masks (called surgical masks US, typically 12 layers specialized material) needed protection virus like this. Maybe people countries case US people access 3 layer paper mask 2-3 layer cotton mask. think Defense production act Europe fine though... Shut baby dick! Yes. Studies confirm it. sure I'm downvoted here. Probably people sub want world lockdown forever.. Interesting. causing spread USA Germany? teachers. something people failed talk entire discussion surrounding opening schools. People understand many elderly people work schools. Whether bus driver, lunch lady, custodian, librarian, administration, etc.

In education, either get burnt years become lifer.

I work education. every single meeting getting back school, single teacher asked, ""what happens get sick?""

Teachers already mentality need sacrifice students. would believe kinda stuff teachers already do. Now, literally sacrifice students. Nice scientists? organization? evidence? article shite. got 2 quotes 2 random scientists (one, chemist) little substance. like bars south Florida do.. re-register business restaurant, keep cooler old sandwiches around case anyone actually orders food, bar safe corona virus. mom Georgia, teaches kindergarten class mid 50's father home immunocompromised. Or, instead dying hill, could remote learning vaccine developed. Maybe could put health students teachers first. me, Americans bunch fat spoiled children raised right. Corona dispel health us. think deal's crazy, they're running promo area they'll take every third bullet FREE!!! 

You'd fool miss savings. Yeah likely intent, enforcement. Makes sense tbh hero. Remember rest life. It’s true, reason kids don’t seem get infected, pass on, serious complications anywhere near extent rest population does. I'm pretty sure need soul first sell it. Yep. friend gave one could give partner. using mask 6 weeks. He’s medical social worker, big hospital, major US city. don’t complain afraid laid hospital lost much money due Covid. gov tells med workers PPE lying. believe husband infected February 8. spent 3 nights recliner using meditation order breathe. course, know (still can’t confirm) suspect Corona. mean, don’t think it’s absurd comparison...care explain think so? bragging, making point, told airborne, stayed stuck lock down, we’re pretty much back normal I'm country actually locked US due circumstances outside April. US never locked down. maybe states, counties, cities. never country been. Always crush Hilary growing still adult. Knew one good ones. excellent long read Times. China accidentally dropped bollock sure. Im also wesring mask trend setter. people see masks likely wear them! Lol yup. Boss came back Florida went straight kitchen even unloading car. exposed whole staff. Fun. review study focuses droplets. There’s money rent hotel rooms travelers. city ever want foot bill. Especially Chicago Wished prioritized essential workers.

If gonna label such, treat such. rouund two lockdown europe next months remedies

Such as? Sure, ideal, far could find information, exceptional flights Brazil Portugal. 

People also fly UK Spain, cross border open Portugal come back Spain fly UK there's control that. Please know alone :)

Many people world feel way terribly difficult retain confidence oneself real life surrounding going another way, promise you, many many people going thing around you, even locally, spoken yet, myself, UK, sending love best wishes family difficult time :)

Follow science facts best that's do, whatever happens please know definitely alone :) million unmasked march? Jesus. 🙄 uncaring people’s safety be? Iowa’s governor worst. never truly lockdown, people simply don’t care anymore. don’t know it’s worth risking student teach anymore, also tired working shitty grocery store. also live coastal NC, it’s shit show here. people seen year. point, may well open everything up, get people back work. spreading germs everywhere anyway. It’s definitely older crowd area. Went grocery store late last night avoid crowds literally people wearing masks folks 40 over. Unfortunately live conservative farm town many drinking trump fountain. Wait gyms still open? state in? I’m NY sometimes forget every state shut down. even Texas goes full lockdown today it'll take weeks go back down. think school glorified daycare, please don’t go teaching.

School hugely positive thing young people it’s hard go benefits. Silly person. Dont know books people read. Germany fine covering mouth nose whatever cloth available.

If forgot mask home pull shirt nose. Everyone expected good boy really depends. I’m Victoria, Australia we’ve school 2000 students closed students staff isolated due outbreak, think there’s 33 cases increasing.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Lucky indeed, moved portland Feb, got laid off, never saw dime unemployment day since march 20th. move way back home michigan. horrible time right now. India grow 100k cases day next 6 weeks. Yes I’m Montreal know “Youtube expert TVA nouvelle” talking lol. can’t believe people actually defending choice. lot citizens countries helped tests produce drug, it’s going usa. imagine risking life help make drug finding benefit one country foreseeable future. ""We seeing particular increases cases deaths associated COVID-19 among communities color Shelby County, especially African Americans Latin-X communities disproportionately bearing burden COVID-19 pandemic,"" said Rear Admiral Jonathan Mermin, medical doctor U.S. Public Health According U.S. Census, Hispanics account six percent Shelby County's population, 28 percent COVID-19 cases.

54% Shelby County's population black.

[Coronavirus cases skyrocketing among communities outbreak worsens throughout South West, caseloads growing fastest counties large communities color. people running around supporting Bernie screaming social consciousness months ago??? article Dr Today show stating believes contracted Covid airplane even though wore mask gloves. open clubs telling people ok go visit them. question open first place? Sometimes utterly ashamed British. medical students, trained hygiene protocol understanding disease transmission, stop touching face hope average person? Excellent reading comprehension fail. 3.000.000 cases USA hours Well Minnesota cant say going Alaska. allowed Canada go Alaska Alaskan citizen returning home lower 48. American citizens cant say hoping Alaska hell right Let’s assume one warp speed vaccines works able mass produce 350,000 vaccines, distribution still needs figured. It’ll little bit time every American able vaccinated. hurt you? talking exactly? Yes, American quickly recognize attitude sunk ship. baby whining maybe masks work... Next thing know, nobody wearing them, case 100% effective. Yeah. specific health related issue. mind ppl like mask. think similar vaccination. ppl simply cannot take it. rely rest us it. 99% wear mask, problem.

But appears ppl capable differentiate conditions situations cannot think independently live wrong country. Still questioning wearing mask hear you. entire family Texas including almost 90 Year old mom seen 4 years.
I live Florida good either. thought Detroit gets bad rap?  America deep systemic issues Biden 0 intentions addressing. said much.

Why bullied voting one two only? lot people immigrate Canada least secure permanent residency two years schooling. Idk they’ve since closed loop though. huh???

I referring asymptomatic spread talking airborne transmission. 

And yes think much problem asymptomatic spread argument much media (and scientists apparently) quantify difference asymptomatic time testing actually asymptomatic. got source first point? sure B! feel bad right.  duh musk take gewd dam freedom away. is? article focused one thing young people. Nowhere say it’s entirely fault. million articles drop plenty blame officials. mom 2 years away retirement. terrified. No, citizens Minnesota arent allowed travel Alasaka gell it, got citizens Alaska returning home Tell brother he’s fucking idiot.  Canadians went home long time ago. point Florida weather nice Canada.

The bigger worry Canada border reopened Americans come across. Hey thanks I'm going check out! whole vacation thing really sketching out. Went beach FL actually came kitchen way home dropping stuff much quarantine. That’s saying though. survive going buildings air conditioning system filters, it’s absolutely useless wear mask. Cause one political party said way bexert control extremely paranoid base. agree. stop us trying. noticed Covid Catastrophe huge uptick space related articles such. US announced space force, many new military unclassified encounters, new signals outer space. Yeah, study based 160 medical students could stop touching faces. So, based that, responsible people told masks ineffective. disagree. like saying knife used kitchen anyone someone cannot use properly. kind symptoms linger? ask source tell statement straight lie. said didn’t call one, know really didn’t.

Look bias snopes link simple yes question “mixture” “what’s true” paragraph directly related question “what’s false” single sentence “no didn’t” Seriously...I lost two coworkers already PPE supplies running dangerously low. told reuse gowns minimum 3 months now. quarantine/isolation facility halfway full it’s already mess. Perhaps multimillion dollar punitive payout doesn’t worry working while? It’s American way! neighbor America. look like genius. everyone focused death numbers only? There’s evidence many “survive” majorly screwed either lung scarring permanent lung damage (even asymptotic!) organ failures neurological problems worse. many cases, death would seem like sweet release. Like poor Broadway actor. 

We’re going dealing health aftermaths virus many years come. high number cases enough terrify everyone safer behavior. answer question question. many people think masks hoax? Pretty fucking stupid. difference assuming something taking precautions scientifically proving demonstrating hypothesis. completely shielded. family came humble background know many relatives negatively affected piss poor response.

Also one big major health emergency bank account would probably wiped clean. went basic ass checkup minor issues last year even pay ass for, even company insurance. Ridiculous hell. There's definitely truth that. one biggest challenges science public. think scientists trying reinforce idea virus changed. point, lot people reading likely react ""well fuck then, cares do."" one reasons CDC hesitant advise everyone wear masks. lead ""fuck it, I've got mask want"". 

It's similar problem direction. Mask wearing make people think they're invincible. Airborne transmission make people think there's nothing bother trying. got beat 2 hours man. laughed at- policies go directly anything we’ve ever learned practiced regards infection control. It’s insane. Prime Minister opened country. he's big friend admirer Mr.Trump. hope helps explain type person charge here. think understand person ""dies condition.""

Exactly. lot people exercised logical thinking skills. See also [examples Fallacy People fall kind basic logic traps. I'm confused. guy bot? meltblown polypropylene mask

Where one buy one these? Lmfao, America obviously survive. Death rates we'll get eventually. sucks people selfish really fucking cynical saying America die off? know everyone complex uses elevators regularly. rarely ever see anyone ever use stairs. apartment far stair well always super quiet. Thanks! barely know means appreciate Thank you. work asked reuse PPE day day “until soiled.” Patients families required wear mask (unless patient cannot bc legitimate medical issue getting oxygen bc can’t breathe) ask put damn masks back day. everyone smart considerate 3 year old. COVID lungs really tricky diagnose evaluate.

Have pulmonary function test yet?

When last CT? health conditions? Older teachers / health conditions wife’s district offered online teaching positions students take remote learning option looking long term disability duration pandemic. Can’t afford upset bot traders kind hope happens one day. I'd love reason punch one people. Triggering people taking virus seriously might needed point. dumb

If we’re honest think jury still one  I'm supportive protests since good cause, fucking hate double standards kick say protests contribute cases... First everyone wore mask, even then, mask meant provide 100% immunity, especially cramped together shouting. Solid work FL, amount people vacationing pandemic sickening. median time death 18 days symptom onset. yeah aussie even think I've held actual money hands/pockets since like february. Same. district’s”plan” us going back normal, restrictions! Can’t wait! Florida, there's 365 new deaths since chart stopped counting projected 379-428 within 7 days.

For Texas, there's 246 new deaths since chart stopped counting projected 259 377.

Hopefully, current data accurate since would indicate over-estimations. I'm confused. article contradicts said virus affecting students 12 years old. Im sure areas wont. actually wasnt referring schools going away. point remains areas, reopening yet. example, district put nearly half million devices, hotspots, prepaid internet platforms distance learning. already million dollar budget shortfall. Theres budget pull from. time switch back, money come somewhere. Ive already pointed lots parents saw final straw enrollment likely decline areas. others wont. guess mostly wait see type thing. rich person afford without income awhile

when ever mattered? defining characteristic ultra rich drive acquire money far beyond could ever spend lifetimes. 

they care money poor people despite set life money validation, meanwhile poor people nebulous thing they're never allowed long anyway. She’s complaining needle sharp pain neck week, she’s puking nonstop last two nights, called sick work, yet crowded gas station three kids, mask sight. brave. that, that’s cops killing black people. got close widows rainy (it often is) got close windows cold. open windows make students wear coats class. We'll see.

Also, students every classroom leave classroom every hour, even five minutes classroom ventilates, get corridors full students meeting students classrooms. 20 classrooms regular school here, letting every hour physically feasible stay apart students classrooms.

It sounds simple, isn't. small, 100-student schools, might manageable. 1000-student schools, things get complicated, many hours day. Medical bankruptcy thing Canada. 

And unemployment insurance got screened another two months community outbreaks linked dental office.... still think aerosol transmission. may tracing aerosol transmission likely incidental (someone touching face, touching PPE). would like see 100 percent sure data scientists...  post edited. thanks explanation So? infect? What’s viral load delivers? That's reality, even true told ""secret"" safer airline travel, go forth apply get plane. feeling history pandemic written biology / mutation virus shown much impactful social measures.

The 'European' mutation virus seems way way efficient spreading. takes hold community open even little bit going get whacked way New York matter do. 

You blunt impact social measures, inevitably come. Inevitably virus terrifying, we're given illusion control told isolate, wash hands wear masks. Same. say anything pass aisle store, politely request stranger maybe put nose? Ugh. We're another viral video waiting happen shame either requester requested. shame. really. 700 isn’t massive amount for
In marketplace serving 350m people I’ve saying this. It’s masks, it’s indoor dining, bars nightclubs. Canada, massive province government making executive decisions based current covid situation region. 

Larger metro areas, especially international airports, hit hardest. Sparsely populated provinces high prevalence rural areas like mine also hit pale comparison provinces like Ontario BC. 

Our province's government shut near immediately got first case quite proactive strict enforcing quarantine distancing policies. outlier morons public largely complied. new case 37 days active 17 (that know of). like? details district returning pretty vague right *since superintendent literally leave COVID*

I’m trying get virtual assignment can’t I’m considering taking leave beginning year sitting back wait schools become obliterated inevitably forced close again. Great. bad virus also devastating long-term health effects. god, ever end? something 100% effective must completely useless. That's really relevant conversation though. Rich people wanted open economy thry'd rather see poor people die 1% lower profits quarter.  Ya right keep telling lol don’t know you’re trolling don’t know difference protesting racial injustice throwing party fun don’t know tell you. Please go local news social media page take look comments. Plenty parents treat daycare, bare minimum. pandemic shown yet another underlying social issue failed address: proper support education system.

Plenty parents don’t give shit neither administrations schools. It’s going way year yet people sign teach, help kids. Show little respect. remember first time got train Tokyo. peak morning commute time, could practically hear pin drop. Japanese together. mean live UK, gripes it, yeah could funding, works damn sight better US. There's ""may be"" it. killing others. understand Americans seem think well versed this. mean lengths go order discredit amazing. find minute detail hours clicking links. Yet, saying N.A. missed research. bet lot N.A. pointing reason people lied yet say known since Feb Someone MIT invent Air Analyzer laser sensors alert user increase aerosol particulates near vicinity. Thus allowing user cautious. south rise cases life pretty much treated normal here, there’s virus going around, maybe bad flu season. 

It’s hot af south right now, it’s like A/C exclusive south April. last one ~2 weeks ago. assuming droplet transmission. wish much anything society conscientious Japanese. Anyone read scientific literature virus Chinese scientists published last Winter knew got downvoted xenophobic anti mask crowd. mean mask won’t stop it? see mask stopping droplets airborne seems indicate paper mask would enough. important use multiple angles ""attack"" virus like staying 6 feet apart *and* staying home much possible.

Face masks even they're useless covid (published numbers anywhere 10-60% effective depending conditions) really hygienic anyways help reduce spread                                             lots diseases. Kurt Tucholsky source quotation often misattributed Der Tod eines Menschen: das ist eine Katastrophe. Hunderttausend Tote: das ist eine Statistik!

From “Französischer Witz“ Good them, growing viruses outbreaks whole lives, used *mind blown* arguing people said hospitals treating droplet precautions, would point studies would say greated minds knew better came policy making. 

No, researchers right political move lack PPE wanting cause panic risk healthcare workers/essential workers showing work. usual prevent panic like original mask lies. cares many people get sick? We've turned fucking USSR Chernobyl. 

I refuse believe organizations know research I, people read reddit covid information, knew about. insanity. Orange county, 15,000 people infected, health director Nichole Quick resigned mid-June confronted banner depicting Nazi, protests outside house personal threats. Quick issued order requiring residents wear masks public, county sheriff insisted wouldn’t enforce. became third high-level health official Orange county quit, county quickly reversed Quick’s order – recommending, insisting residents wear Memorial Day holiday Californians “thought safe parties, go overcrowded beaches, get close people take masks”, said Lee Riley, epidemiologist University California, Berkeley. “People began fixate individual liberties without understanding one fundamental civil liberties US right health – right stay alive.” Particularly symptomatic people isolate themselves. force virus mutate something less likely produce symptoms. Essentially forcing virus become less severe overall would imagine. It’s going require heavy Federal intervention. Community lockdowns, Online education, continued stimulus payments vaccine, copious hazard pay frontline workers, meals-on-wheels financial disadvantaged families. They’re trying put superintendents, training epidemiology limited power beyond school system. 3 months ago millions people infected could start chains transmission. think prevailing view overblown let run course. 

Big mistake IMO time tell That's health every right protect yourself! I'm sorry feel forced put uncertain circumstances. wish anyone felt unsafe financially go back unsafe place business. I'm really sorry this,for anyone else put health lives hands uninformed willfully ignorant people. large open space offices? Multiple thermostats per AHU? many people likely variable air volume system, means air handler running continuously individual spaces cycle high low airflow depending temperature requirements. units actually turning following code arent providing ventilation. I'm saying someone couldnt gone changed programming try save energy, thats standard all. shit makes embarrassed American. holy fuck.  FWIW also get pissy karens kens yelling kids ""not wearing masks right"" There's way approach people, ain't it. Yes, since preschool high school. college. know loony nurses met heard Jacksonville worked Baptist Health. Exactly! people generally hangout age wear mask stay home possible. people around dad’s age know complaining tyranny. aren’t exactly young, late 40’s early 50’s. made error. refrain it.

Most 87 current cases cluster near almost uncloseable Brazilian border, health worker apparently got careless, things visited near Brazilian city, got infected, spread coworkers. soon enough hospital infected quarantined, least cluster contained now. rest country amused, 12 active cases left that, health workers certainly need better get careless among coworkers. get that. RN lot years observation factor missing whole COVID response equation lack reliable public information. working E-bola scare within week, nurses trained disease pamphlets pamphlets information public educate public. Then, actually educated every one patients filled risk assessment every one patients! response chaotic best confusing folks don’t understand, coupled avalanche disinformation - it’s recipe disaster, IMO Hang on...this link news report quoting newspaper states group scientists (who?) publishing letter addressed point soon journal. What’s evidence? ""Our research shows killed shitload people shitload less time."" - Scientist drive 20+ hours problem, doesn’t mean people too. would safe so. Stop policing woman live life you. virus airborne, droplet spread, meaning virus survive HVAC filtering systems masks dont shit fact masks made fabric means safety, social engineering. 100% time, someone calls someone else selfish , trying manipulate something don’t want do. advice clear follow thought. Provides get directly dribs drabs. 

You also accept change advice new evidence comes light. 

Precautions aerosolised transmission recommended early February. people need know - know (your public health experts - CDC) disseminate information tot general public you. really depressing best case scenario family already caught experienced mild symptoms/were asymptomatic. I've working outside home entire time wish bothered PPE kind. matter when. I'm really hoping child greet 2021 orphan. Constitution protects rights government, private entities.

The confusion happens lot private entities obligated state laws protect similar rights classes, last checked, right maskless middle pandemic explicitly protected (at least state CA). pay union dues - protect people like you. That’s fair. despise too.

At least half country forgotten criticism highest form patriotism. Midway page there’s graph select state, NYC. know vaping correlation spread covid-19. think does. using Vape Cloud example far person's breath travels open air. still burning fast 3m make em. need better mask works easy source materials mom “3 years retirement”. decided retire weeks ago  certain, impression N95 masks available consumer market US. buy costs friendship Jared Kushner. depends transmission rate.

If growth exponential already, dent rate may actually change many people get infected, it'll change quickly number people get infected.

Hence ""flatten curve"", ""lower overall infection count"". Oh fuck me.... peak stupidity? also explain people sunglasses protect eyes wear pushed forehead? ever considered Q shit you’ve reading conspiracy? countries would like overtake place US superpower using disinformation internet convince people use simplest preventative technique ever (wearing stupid mask) kill Americans cripple economy? 

Because that’s what’s happening. astroturfing asshole somewhere taking advantage pandemic spread anti-mask propaganda Americans infect one another die. It’s epically tragic embarrassing I'm reading specialist. students various learning needs (dyslexia, emotional disturbance, ADHD etc) distance learning really hard them. Trust me, one wants back classroom me. But, want way safe me, family, students.

Safely reopening schools one top priorities get go. Instead, got tizzy haircuts bars. Now, weeks go, we're left scrambling. many unanswered ""what ifs"". kid comes school virus? going always send back class cough drop?That's gross cold flu season, could right deadly.

There's really easy answer. every parent insisting kids need back classroom, there's another saying they'll keep kids home indefinitely. Schools much support, except guidelines written people must classroom...ever. Right now, schools trying get sense way winds public opinion blowing, trying go there. 

This pandemic really highlighted much responsibility shifted towards schools. could great way reallocate resources think restructuring schools. Instead, seems back business usual. Schools asked even time budgets facing deep cuts. Teachers often go beyond use money purchase classroom materials. provide PPE and, likely, students? think know helps positively reducing spread. believe earlier version virus vulnerability spike protein could break attempting enter cell. newer version stronger spike protein harder break, infectious. Germany far densy populated, culturally include smaller bars transport etc many parts states... general rule they're little bit collective average American, recognising value protecting/valuing society want live in, importantly far better leaders/govt critically, less conflicting messaging media (which degree, runs US govt) America.

They're still risk blowing up, average they'll try little bit harder, bringing R0 little bit say, Florida. heard exactly argument--the numbers COVID deaths inflated hospitals(!?!) want extra funding.

I think person responding lives area yet hit first COVID wave cresting across entire US, pretty callous towards areas already saw crest--""I live NYC, course they'll get won't.""

Even pointing small town Georgia one first country overwhelmed cases seem faze them. 

It's NIMBY approach healthcare crisis: back yard [yet], worry? *Or* wear damned mask! That's insane irresponsible. lose mind? lol Unless don’t breakdown available space Pinellas hospital, Saturday 5 p.m.:

Mask work - least personal experience making anecdotal evidence. work hospital one coworkers infected. employee trained two weeks new area. trainers test positive despite working close proximity infected coworker 2 weeks. conclusion due properly wearing mask following proper hygiene. seems risk transmission significantly lowered this. NYC got hit early. already felt full effects virus. rest US hence resistance. Borders open essential travel / trade. Health care workers cross detroit daily. crossed Detroit make quick trip Ohio, delivering parts, custom papers, usa hours. That's ok. Canadian, USA, let 14 day quarantine mandatory. checks you, police rcmp come house. forum science, scaremongering politics. Yeah - tested positive, virus eventually beaten, tested negative, permanent lung damage, death.  Correct. nationwide lock almost crashed economy. also lock country flu close schools year across entire country. Okay still droplets though actually “microdroplets”? mean normal everyday air breathe could theoretically virus it? Pardon ignorance, masks help then? hate passion MMA career ""failed"".

He never became champion anyone makes 7 digits sport considered success. Google net worth 3 million i'm buying it, live like guy net worth 3 M.

Athletic heavyweights sport command premium rare. Conspiracy nuts: ""Imma pretend see that"" Another statistical study. It’s aggregating data making assumptions publishing paper. Deaths going positive you? understand died first place could said vaccine needed controlled better. sound like idiot saying deaths dropping positive. need pass laws throw maskless motherfuckers prison negligent homicide. point plausible deniability left.

Do want see deprived life liberty actually looks like? Let's show them. knew start? inform entire scientific community sure droplet nuclei? could saved thousands lives infinite knowledge! families allowed sue Federal Government actively suppressing response.

...which did. Especially since many used suppression opportunity dump stock, move investments PPE companies.

They literally killed citizens make buck. People howling straight executions. both. People deny either clue. Yes, outbreak California particular, worrisome. Lo siento company manufacturers biological therapies late stage cancer patients require lot PPE maintain sterile production area along cleaning supplies. lot vendors already delayed deliveries certain materials keeps happening, we're danger shutting production. 2013...right 2012...about Mayan timeline..... Gaand mar gayi new? surprise? fact microns small particle float air distance, infect people? groundbreaking me. think lot people thought start. result changes? saying “Thailand hoax”, “Thai people” hoax? maybe think Indian, Malaysian Chinese cuisine Thai food isn’t distinct?

(They wrong accounts, course) counterpoint, every time novel virus came people became docile tyranny every dictator manufacturing biochemistry labs? learn everything need know health Russian trolls Facebook. Normalcy = making money. way calculate many people get it, survive die, cases start go given population? I've heard that, believe much.

Always go back basics. know viruses work. magically sparing children. eat restaurant air conditioning either then, virus circulated around room too. totally support you. protecting teachers? expendable. care children low risk. point promise sacrifice life teaching? Anyone thought businesses believed safe reopen paying attention. ""pale comparison provinces like Ontario BC.""

WTF? mentioning Quebec mentioning BC 99% control since beginning flattening curve teh last 2 weeks? Biased much? Albertan perhaps? course Americans. banned entering Canada rest lives. privilege, right Actually shown. I've trying intermittent fasting months, usually can't make shorter 7 8 hour eating window can't suppress damn appetite. I'll try hold food long can, hungry three hours wake up, cave eat 11:00. However, also quit caffeine back winter gave desire get hooked again. know healthy ways curb appetite? drink lot water work either. I'd love make work I'm terrible regular diets, adjusted schedule yet, I'm sure ever will.  good trend here. Probably going improve time soon either since lot covid patients extended hospitalization. Please stay safe people. Hey, friend, think I've seen post Iowa subreddits. know much, care I'm sorry people make feel like less worth. Teachers important people society, criminally undervalued. position like this, one choose health advancing career. unfair, angry you. situation sucks, leadership Iowa sucks, COVID-19 sucks. wish different. :-( No, droplets 100-1000% larger aerosolized particles. Droplets land ground (hence 6 feet social distancing) aerosolized particles hang air 12 hours poorly ventilated indoor areas. 132K dead people today. Thats approx 6 months time compared yearly flu deaths. Pretty easy understand. ?? one said wearing regular mask face covering 100 percent effective protection covid. helps lower transmission rate. Also states US mandated masks ( ex: MA) countries seen much lower cases covid. heard joke UK &amp; USA walking bar? 

The USA proceeds get shit faced sing Karaoke, UK sits back cringes horror, turns USA says - ""Hey, hold beer""  racism - believe anything smelly asian countries say put snapchat Instagram pretend life actually interesting. great time, convincing others they're great time someone studied Textile Engineering, yes. Also, though, multilayer cloth okay, least much closer nonwoven synthetics (surgical masks) single layer cloth I’m saying shouldn’t work compliance. It’s going perfect everyone going uptake message, however.

Yes school education, also means daycare many families. cannot put blanket statement school education students don’t behave it’s due bad parenting. That’s incredibly condescending hard working parents there. Kids school reason, make mistakes learn them. parents bad. Yikes. bet lot N.A. pointing this

I used lot analysis modeling work public health, still talk lot friends keep literature. 

I saw bit research coming Southern Europe Asia conflicting information coming US Europe, trusted (apparent) US CDC consensus droplet-borne *not* aerosol. 

Given degree know US government invested misleading us, it’s hard trust case “missing [our] research.” remember saying one point sub, got downvoted hell it. Guess finally accept fact? No, NY shutdown 2 weeks highs. shutdown, immunity, caused decrease cases. Unfortunately, FL TX done that... Pointing good news middle disaster puts things perspective paints accurate picture. Predictions incorrect, surging deaths, help anything. Report things honestly. Good news bad news deserves reported. Lower death rates major plus Trump loves tours without PPE, let's invite him. Google works still. Check out. seriously doubt that. RIDICULOUS would upvote this, can't basically give something ""thumbs up"" horrible. mother also teacher, Ohio hotspot. teaches high school special needs students. WAY safely. trying figure financially afford quit. doesn't, she'll definately bring home 2 high risk family members. 

There kids spitters, kids change diapers for, kids wheel chairs help physically use restroom, kids can't comprehend staying seat... forget mask wearing. 

These scary times. really wishing best try stay safe. tried culture luck managed grow e. coli. Where’s source buddy? poll have? assumed declined? Please feel free look Louisiana, Iowa Idaho here( ) explain second waves. map also shows effected regions heaviest protests occurred (although are). 


Feel free compare locations listed here( ) 


No one saying risk, least UK(where am) people protests wore masks/face coverings. one saying protests causes 0 new cases, bonkers public health lockdown strategy US significantly fault. Protests estimated attendance 15-26 million people. Compared entirety US population that's 7.88%. public health policy affects them. much protests help health crisis bad due policies place. MLB BLM backwards always misread headlines. Yeah, NY around 11k/day highest point Ok, allow airplane travel? I'm interest paywall live coast shit show yesterday. don’t feel safe here. city cares tourism. go wait tables day said tourists keep house. Life dream. think doing?

I could see students year school less damaging online half-assing it.

The class 2020 got screwed. Untrue. know untrue. way internet unaware criticism China, US, Russia etc... choice words intended. charge antisemitism blanket response criticism Israel. Instead addressing actions, antisemitism used attack idea criticism itself, dare criticize Israel's actions.

A former prime minister Israel, think Menachem Begin, member Irgun, justified Jewish religious terrorism British saying atrocities committed weak forgiven forgotten. seems Israel moved beyond despite longer weak. Yes, except, politicians upper management frame decisions make positive thinking rather tunnel vision. People keep regurgitating cliche, true. something provides minor protection, makes people behave much reckless due perception protection, end net harm. Little thing called unintended consequences kind news pretty annoying state, least suburb, vast majority people wearing masks public places. Heck, lot even wear car. Stupid South. ‘Hold beer’ UK  setting foot airplane. Ah man, another sub though lol What? Due safety lot schools can’t open windows leave doors open. live next Columbine can’t that. NONE scenarios issue follow CDC protocols get vaccine. 

BULLSHIT

Following CDC protocols leaves vulnerable getting infected.  mask better nothing cloth mask leaves vulnerable infection. N95 mask. intent never stop airborne particles. Reduce yes. Stop no. 100% compliance CDC still get infected. Quit shit. Currently 12 kids one classroom. table required wear masks walking around classroom. allowed share material, suppsoed wash hands regularly get mingle kids classes (until sit bus) Make virus pay wall wonder viral loads patients look like today, compared March? Also wonder hospital 'duration stay discharge' compares. provide citations please? Sorry wife. like idea teachers/staff showing first week so. wonder would enough force DeSantis online schooling. market capture big corporations expense small local Business is... 

Agreed. Americans notoriously issues volume control. 2020, consider Early Warning System: hear us, you’re close. thing Italy NY, virus going burn vulnerable population Way blame neutral body actually disseminates information, buddy. probably depends type agreement property owner business owner end paying that. Im sure goes through, places actually put effect, legal haranging (but probably wont go far since upgrading system safe occupancy space already leasing agreement) U wear mask reduce risk even bit Maybe went pandemic living partner..

Meanwhile, single extrovert exciting thing happened sexually giving UTI vibrator. Meanwhile still deal people think ""staying 6ft away"" crowded restaurant perfectly safe. found easy get tested Berlin. light cough went doctor, needed say one sentence: “I work gastronomy” got test immediately. 

Maybe bit extraneous also think German cultural fascination airing flats helps lot too. believe kids need interact one another. Isolation awful. also think kids wear mask class, least time, could re-evaluate adapt mask policies. 

But matter think, government ask opinion, also many parents (and non-parents) currently spending evenings crowded bars, infection rates slowly climbing. Yesterday government decided quarantine region 200.000 people another 70.000, infection rates rising dangerously. So, yeah, we're fucked anyways. foresee bowling becoming popular again. young kids, much harder. Nothing like 4 5 year old fighting 4 year old making huge messes, wife expects help tidy handle kids problem can't handle own.

I almost get booted telecommute program due this. office another room go focusing work. real hassle causing make mistakes work. would literally forget things overlook important emails due interruptions. 

I love family, can't job. balls vice situation affected performance. wife going try something different time around potential office basement; however, flooding mold problem there.

I thought telecommute would great, easy one kid home sick - covid-19 happened. home, can't keep up. eating alive, especially given become less professional saying things like forgot follow now, kids interrupting work, etc. shit show, able take pride work, feel ashamed productivity nose dived professionalism cratered.

Sorry long rant, stressful. hard working two jobs, dealing young kids, financial pressures life work separate home. need structure able focus work without constant interruption. rate actually true, would mean 20 30 million cases US right now. DH sped teacher Ohio too. returning back work semi hotspot. He's teacher moderate severe autistic kids. completely freaked moderate risk catching covid. That's glaring failure global handling pandemic. trust scientific findings countries (somewhat justified case China), everyone reinventing wheel making mistakes countries made months before. Lolwut I'm sure everything fine. goodness obtuse. Read follow response medical professional. comment doctor talking infections hospital folk bieng surgical masks. That's reason wrote it. keep Dcik you. actual article yet released leaks see limping along, losing family friends along journey. didn’t say people discharged they’re 100% well. People don’t need take hospital bed cause low grade fever mild SOB. they’re discharged SNF don’t require hospital level care. Covid patients discharged SNFs (in LA) nowhere else go. SNFs accepting Covid patients, entire floors dedicated that. can't believe fell that. worrisome, fact missed sarcasm oozing comment.  core job, collecting communicating information understandable way useful? outside layer skinis dead tissue. really good stopping virusses nasty things. wasn't, get sick time.
The porblem someone small cut skin virus seep touches something contaminated, touch something else. clean hands touch ""something else"" thing afterwards, they're still touching something contaminated, run risk infecting next hours touching face. extra steps. would wearing gloves prevent something like infecting keys wallet? return August 5th lol

Not rate Hospital administration littered businessmen understanding clinical medicine, run healthcare system gas station. see numbers spreadsheets. Someone get Hillary Duff phone make sense situation! Humans. applies humans. Humans put one another risks based choices actions, fucking ages. That's convenient scapegoat. fact democratic american sources spouting dumb shit masks ineffective, virus could spread touching surfaces on

Actually, I'm Canadian, even government many Canadians repeating kind ill-informed, poorly thought nonsense masks virus transmitted touching surfaces. later ""droplets"". finally people admit airborne. could ever explained virus spreading quickly ineffectual means touching surfaces beyond me.

And fact good research January pointing airborne. western world completely failed event scientific, social, cultural governmental levels. form here. enforced. spent good deal time several Latin American countries, still problems, huge improvements lowering poverty, increasing access education health care, several positive changes many places last 10-20 years.

This pandemic serious blow improvements, remained fragile. Ah. tone phrasing made go ""what person Greeks?"" 

Tbh still does... bunny ebola? suspected. ever seen Thai person Malaysian person room? Clearly hoax. emirates. Monarchies. “shakeup” involve overthrowing them. is? also frustrating one following proper precautions wanting bring end soon possible, idiots keeps best make sure pandemic stays control. Yes. many ways Founders tried curb slavery. Franklin, John Jay Hamilton officers states Anti Slavery Leagues. Washington fought freedoms his, going far free will. Gouverneur Morris spoke often, famous quote ‘the curse heaven States prevailed.’

Jefferson, first draft Declaration Independence condemned institution slave trade. Also Articles Confederation banned import foreign slaves time Jefferson called banning slavery Northwest Territory. 

So perfect, many Founders adverse thoughts slavery acted towards end. One main issues gave promoting limited government people’s lives lived tyrannical rule Britain knew first act newly formed government abolish slavery everything fault would end. wasn’t wanted slavery, Americans wanted slaves, mistrust government would start then. powers given states start, laws ability ban slavery written Bill Rights. laid path groundwork beginning. Test retest week I'm entirely sure scientific distinction always said act like airborne minutes mostly droplets concerned about, time saying straight airborne. scary thing huge lockdowns like Spain last long. starts spreading again. point. 

I remember watching orange gibbon making remarks stage pet drugs press immediately asked Dr Fauchi drugs would help said no. Pissed orange gibbon right off. Good them! hope ban this! getting lot downvotes, agree you. I'm working special education, distance learning disastrous almost kids. kids general ed also suffering they've less work, ""class"" time homework. months schools closed set many kids back far. Even dangers come reopening, I'm praying school district takes in-person approach kids work dont regress even firthet.

Now, said, absolutely agree places control. state new cases single digits gone couple weeks without death, another weeks without any. We've noticed small uptick reopening, pretty minimal, mandatory mask regulations. department education also come guidelines safe reopening, I'm confident school district follow guidelines. feel completely safe going back, far safer SO, works grocery store around hundreds people wearing masks encroaching personal space weeks March/April masks accepted. People working in-person selling things far less important (haircuts, alcohol) child's education. Abstract

And planes I'm aware went Uruguay Australia 2 Greg Mortimer's passengers/crew. stated purpose ""you need mask"" ""doctors healthcare workers need first enough.""

That stated purpose. recall official positions changed, earlier year *were* told masks help. got quite discussions, even subreddit, insisted would least mitigating factor. vaper, used visual aid explain family friends shows places mandated masks better not. 

Why listen experts? must feel like recommendations valid actual scientists PhDs? think room one sound like knew talking about? large gathering campers result virus spread. matter careful people somebody get spread begin. People want life normal isn’t possible right now. What’s disability rate? seeing 20 percent 90 days still unfit work kindw recently found solid particles cigarette smoke COVID-19 virus roughly size. Yet claim prioritize “health safety.” Unfortunately nurses doctors going slammed trying save all.  Karma mask deniers makes hell medical personnel unfortunately. It’s full quarantine; they’re restricting movement area, requiring face masks, reducing restaurant capacity. Sounds reasonable me. Yes. I’ve seen multiple randomized controlled studies. Here, I’ll link another one. 

They show we’ve known along. don’t wear mask protect yourself. wear mask protect everybody yourself. way, wear masks, lower transmission rate considerably. 

The masks keep droplets air. Including microdroplets, called “airborne” droplets. keep virus load low reduce infection rates. controlled trials health care workers showed respirators, worn continually shift, effective worn intermittently. Medical masks effective, cloth masks even less effective. used sick patients randomised controlled trials suggested protection well trial experimental design published April 2020, examining range viruses including seasonal human coronaviruses (Leung et al., 2020). showed coronaviruses preferentially found aerosolized particles compared large droplets, could expelled normal tidal breathing. Wearing surgical mask prevented virus exhaled. Even could somehow add 2000 beds, good luck finding properly trained medical staff operate them. course not. hydroxychloroquine work hospitalised Covid-19 patients.

It's meant taken get phase hospitalised. walked house party last night least 100 people... many young people don’t give ..... naive here? Let X probability non-COVID obese person heart attack, let probability non-COVID fit person heart attack. assumption COVID increases/multiplies X roughly Z value. wrong here? I’m aware that, point, didn’t advise masks April 4th. still denies proof airborne transmission. Desantis using schools voting even early Aug 18th. even suggested teachers could poll workers lol. Yeah right.Expose expose families, expose kids.Just they're teachers paid state mean expendable make another job.I hope protest campus learning. can't give 3 months information reddit comment. Read. I'm healthcare worker. We're fucked too. thing going away, fortunately getting less lethal (really dunno thou?). can't keep economy pause indefinitely neither. Everybody's getting bug, everybody's gonna roll dice. anyway good numbers massive time, waves less manageable. protracted pest better acute one, specially disease outcome depends often quality healthcare. economy needs greased bodies Yes, actually happened.  airborne spread mean can't stop unless maintain lockdown vaccine available? scientist article says scared be? means indoor space major hazard foreseeable future. 7 news people! either old news baity wording. instance stated 100% proof, said research papers published lent weight strong evidence this. attempt twist words meaning. go back UK Thurs work month. I've avoiding like plague back 4 months. I'm dreading reaction finally allowed go drink overpriced alcohol central London. Wholey shit. opening Disney land, lockdowns (only night curfews?) opening schools month hardly measures. ever-loving hell Florida? haven’t following state much beyond world meter tells (I’m Canada) Jesus. trying herd immunity what? Hey watch freedoms downvoted everyone else was. Sorry. several leaders national state level. Talk subversive, foreign agent matches “wrecking” nonsense political lizard brains. proof this. subreddit pure cancer. Build wall make America pay it. Welcome nursing! get pay cuts global pandemic.

You'll love just-in-time staffing too.  It’s kindergarten. would strongly consider holding back year, honest. It’s possible literally best time age/academic standpoint. Shut baby dick! understand article housed Greg Mortimer passengers big challenge say Greg Mortimer passengers flight Uruguay (if any) related current issues Melbourne. 4th world country's people behaves: respect science, respect others, brain cell left think, self awareness stupid oneself is. shithead person is. can't believe 30+% approval. bunch idiots think he's right care enough. worry happens places robust contact tracing


😬 wonder type information suppressed orders administration, dismantled scientific bodies point information wasn’t even registered due lack staff incompetence. though, they've said thing rallies. useful Might want brush grammar. says had. means past. That’s Greg Mortimer passengers since flights Montevideo Australia. Death rates low attributed pneumonia respiratory failure instead COVID. equivalent attributing motor vehicle accident deaths ""blunt trauma"" ""blood loss"". We're getting sick shit. American feel way. Speak yourself.
There freedoms freedoms from; Japan freedom other's people's selfishness. Scare enough economy stay wrecked 2050s 

There really good idea gave toddler computer? Oh we're planning? /s
This really perfect summation. absolute ridiculous level privileged imagine worst form government one makes behave like responsible citizen. classes start florida? wonder professors problem plan. Making masks voluntary students absurd. bout advertising gross. People talk Americans giving shit poor, British perfected art looking noses everyone. I’m glad you’re much better us gods gave great wealth. Must great. Wearing masks (in USA) become politicized point tell someone’s political affiliation precautions take public Oh yeah, gots lotta bullets. climate right now, I'm keeping safety.  point admit virus move air droplets touch conversations 6 feet going kill everyone need accept fate? Japanese experiment showing it.  asked Magic 8 ball confirm, said ""Signs point yes. definitely handled better Canada, make mistake. proud government well handled it, certainly proactive approach saved many lives. 

With said, still see instances within news resources parroting incorrect informtion transmission, shelf life virus, asymptomatic carriers already disproved published research articles mentioned earlier. Have...have never city north Mason-Dixon Line summer? looked weather forecast? one example, high New York today 92 degrees F. sincerely don’t understand argument. They're saying thing Republican rallies. political. Especially band teacher regional confirmation validity statement. county lot Greek named schools. Georgia governor ok... plan 2 week quarantine go Orlando.

The issue hardcore gets enforced. reality takes one dude sneak girl thinking big deal nothing's going happen. Seems serve rich, donors. Makes sense like CDC lowered safety requirements PPE due lack lf it, want classified airborne isolation needs N95 reverse flow isolation rooms hospital US enough of. disease classified airborne minimum safety requirements met hospital staff could lawsuits putting danger. 100% effort reduce liability. Haha oh, wrong. must suck dumb confidently ignorant are. Ick stadium workers part bubble. work. stop droplets, airborne covid 19. Yes get shared HVAC systems, even contact infected.  already proven months ago. Americans stubborn. prove point? Masks don’t actually stop airborne viruses like COVID unless it’s N95 perfectly suction cupped fit. virus pass masks super easily. fantasy, concern, one that's easy things look bleak right now. Cases rising almost states US (and record numbers states), there's looming eviction crisis coming up, probable debt crisis far behind that, we're heading prolonged global economic depression. Gonna long start seeing things get back normal. really want let teachers come back teach classroom virtual learners. haven’t made internet utility point? virus taught us time change that! One source confusion: west fires every summer. Often air quality bad fires instructed get N95 masks. first heard pandemic/mask, immediately thought n95s, started buying again. N95s suitable pandemic control, that's concept difficult grasp average American panic. Jesus Christ. Nashville, trying avoid people. people wearing masks black people. Pretty much one else. Vanderbilt really first class hospital system state, there’s good trauma center Memphis. places go lot rural folks going die. Source? could happened? Yep add, unoriginal idiots list Man. live fired girl instead. Good shop sticking workers. 20.

What tomorrow? information, followed ""don't know true overall"" basically foundation scientific thought... lol two types people. logic empathy without justify selfish behaviors patriotism and/or independence. 

I sorry suffered. must say, everyone know would take every precaution keep around us safe. might speaking 1/20 local (nonNYC) population though. Here’s hoping patriots get wake call nothing change Yeah, please pass argument vast parts rest world, COVID control economy countries collapse.

This virus problem, *leadership* problem. know childish fantasy problem lies. True, though issue threshold elections party able land seat government fraction vote. Set party needs 10% even 5% primary vote general ballot remove lot extremists. medicine except evidence based medicine. It’s cornerstone like: harm.

We might well go back praying witchcraft without it.

You valid point though: evidence gathering takes time... dissemination information if/when evidence changes theories. 

I’d rather delay quack doctor praying bedside and/or drink blood, blood letting, straight opium consumption like done ages evidence based medicine. local grocery store high compliance. every video US hospitals, doctors wearing 3m halfpieces. sane doctor would wearing surgical mask. spring training started friday. 1st games july 23/24 truly airborne like measles R value around 15, would completley utterly overwhelmed. fact R value covid around 2-3 tells us mostly droplet infection needed viral load big. makes feel better, Australians banned leaving country there’s vaccine Case counts gone higher mortality rate plunged primarily hospitals better prepared, treatments available raise mortality rate better handling outbreaks nursing homes. Also testing available allowing people age 40 tested well, initial outbreak vulnerable tested. Reported! Used fake name though dont want shit coming back bite me. Ridiculous I'm worried getting fired behaving appropriately pandemic. 65 older yes, 65 younger not. Say bye bye sports hello 2020 sucking much more. Horrible Hate dude want mma career still successful. good wins. disrespect hard beat guys like Crocop, Gonzaga, Mitrione.

He's ass comedy sucks let's hate actual achievements like him. DEFUND SCIENTIST‼️ pedantry done order make proper news item seem like something downplayed. Isn’t reason spread New York? People apartments never near anybody shared elevators. Americans clue much power China gained this. Trade deals dissolved, xenophobic rhetoric spewed, empty threats made, allies quietly began stepping away us. there's 4 years ^great negotiator, fukt, think Americans even realize country collapsed sift rubble rest world prosperous moving along. Americans willfully ignorant something affects them, even (2009) seem learn. Smarter Every Day great, thanks recommendation! Mitigation mitigation.

Many experts believe viral load key transmission. Even weak barrier still barrier curbing load. article state that?(it doesnt). learned H1N1 that's New York currently allowing sleep away camps. source material leaked unpublished information case, we’ll wait see letter actually says stop 100% virus make difference. There’s nothing clickbaity accuracy. ad hominem claim making distract article’s assertions.

The headline keeping content actual scientific article. scientists stating it’s droplets it’s airborne. Redditor head thread making baseless claim “nah bro, bullshit. It’s still droplets” false. Coronaviruses survive dry particulates letter confirming covid 19 virus. cool. Ac stays 50 weeks year Many people believe false narrative can’t spread you’re asymptomatic may category. basis claim? Given evidence airborne aerosol vs droplet/fomite transmission, would've thought otherwise. Contact tracing clusters also indicate indoor transmission higher risk outdoors. Hey, student Spain Selectividad Tuesday (that's University Admission Exams basically live Spain know), we've told thing. Mask use obligatory class breaks exams. seated exams masks down, reading makes even nervous new outbreaks week among teenagers teachers... stay safe everyone, we're long run... I’m British. wore mask.... Ask it...

 great numbers spread April....but cool, let's keep forcing ""re-open"". were.

Look TX FL could lock states back down. Hell beginning lock promised would go back work. 

And look TX FL. 

Your going get disagreement me.  pandemic every model counted effort led feds. got bupkis, nothing,nada. plants become non nutritious due pollution, herbivores starve die, carnivores go years, begging whats left federal government baby meat welfare. Australia opened states seem eliminated virus (until/unless it’s reintroduced). virus far reintroduced UK seem generally getting state news ICU beds really breaks cities hospitals within cities. understand, Texas Arizona cities ICU beds. assume patients moved one area another, depending availability, always clear. Due living work situations, one case virus gets community migrant farm workers, it’s unfortunately going spread like wildfire among whole group. Yes Covid situation Florida really bad right now.

NBA know bad would back made choice. came Orlando Vegas, Orlando seemed like lesser evil. Parents wants schools reopen need free babysitters kids poor send kids. die.

*(PDF) Ivermectin Covid-19*. Available from: \[accessed Jul 05 2020\]. Yes, ""find way"" afford 40 days worth rent, food bills job guarantee job 40 days I'm sure comment met ridicule thats fine. calling airborne saying transmitted droplets....

This may fit descriptive definition ""airborne"" means pertaining diseases, IMO get air, airborne. droplets air give virus, airborne. funny thing 99% people went party Fourth July yesterday aren’t gonna end getting Covid it, probably decide nothing wrong. Oh well. Staying spaces prevents well. Eh, say entirely. say masks nothing that's clearly wrong, also simultaneously little nothing ability buy masks time (I know, bought bunch).

And yes, way long relevant question long take aerosol density get enough viral load become infected? much N95 mask extend exposure time infection? Many legitimate questions remain unanswered. Jesus Christ. Good luck, friend. unlikely much anything else. Denmark, don’t massive pandemic raging away. Australia

Are saying Australia bad outbreak right now? map indicate opposite that? sure people think cheap cloth mask worn mouth gaps around somehow better HVAC filter? 0.000007% 18,000,000 1.26

I mean, understand trying convey, going math, check values. Many believe virus. That's reason poll return high. 

They're afraid. Yet. European countries, longer include England, highly dependent air conditiong American continent.

There. I'm exhausted. Lmfao inconvenient doomers right presents possibility good news moment. get September instead presented bad news change minds. probably craking joke, would like know...

Thoroughly wash hands soap warm water elbows, put gloves (do blow gloves putting on). remove gloves fold cuff one wrist revealing less contaminated surface. Use hand folded cuff grab wrist seam glove turn inside pull off. Ball inside glove gloved hand. Pull cuff remaining glove hand turning inside go. happening balled 1st glove end inside second glove. Dispose gloves. Wash hands elbows. 

Gloves create false sense security. get covid touching something touched someone Covid. could hands gloves become contaminated touch eyes, nose, mouth. 

If wearing one pair gloves hours visibly filthy, chances higher gloves contaminated. wearing gloves probably would wash hands got bad.

 dangerous touch face pair gloves barehanded. improperly remove gloves eat takeaway without washing hands think, ""hey wearing gloves, fine"" also increasing risk. # Masks...

Except can’t unlock phone pay looking it. wonder they’ll bring back fingerprint back. Hmmm seems proved point correctly sir, thank you. ban anyone entering borders everyone else closed borders get that. husband Teacher I’m Flight Attendant...IF still job fall, high risk contracting it, making double trouble situation household Ha! knew answer. disregard anything trolls says. They're good faith. Yeah wales UK. guess also fortunate country relatively low population density. mostly farms around here, we're definitely less urbanised england. turn upside slide want get back fully agree you. proven viral load correlated gravity infection. UV rays kill virus, means contagion happening ""light"" viral load, thus giving extreme sickness. would explain low mortality northern hemisphere. Oh we're going finish economy over. ex teacher so.... fucked! eLearning enough stay campus year? don’t want send kids school year. Orange County here. Sunday holiday even noon. Daniel Griffin:

1. Plainview hospital 2200 cases. Daniel partner saw handful. Tremendous amount experience. recording, zero COVID patients hospital. First time since February.

2. Testing
Not enough (lol)

Serology resting - 1 5 never produce positive serology. Antibodies don’t seem last. Unknown durable immunity. 

Don’t go COVID parties! don’t know second infection worse first.

3. Long haulers

Months later lasting effects. providers discount this. 30 days discharge still showing objective evidence pulmonary effects. Patients present way: consistent fatigue, heaviness chest, brain fog, weakness (problem 6 minute walk test), depression, anxiousness, neurological impacts. suggestion early reports - seen often younger women. Several thousands support groups. Learning options.

4 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
Patients respond quite well early otc aspirin, etc.

5. Outpatient characteristics 
Younger, fewer co-morbidities, lower socioeconomic status, 1/3 patients still sick 2-3 weeks out.

6. Thromboembolic complications

Pulmonary emboli, arterial clots. Platelet rich

7. 
Not using z-pack.
Remdisivir - price treatment
Steroids - 
Anti - blocking cascade maybe platelet - aspirin
Teleheath- outpatient use aspirin
Most patients don’t end hospital

8. Pro athletes : big issue sports teams, stay safe. happens lose 10% pulmonary capacity. don’t know long term effects.

9. Schools : universities may plan weekly testing. May try pool testing. 
Syndrome children still exists 
NYState almost 200 cases. think underreported. Put context age dependent effects COVID. Pediatricians want children schools. Open schools, bars. don’t school, every child good home situation. Need open schools right way. Must testing. Put billions dollars testing keep children safe. Yeah. completely unbelievable nurse would put family job deadly pandemic. /s Wow, like 2 days north dakota, employees grocery stores wear masks. Walmart shortened hours. He’s dumbass. We’re 50 states. Taxi/uber drivers June 26th. early tell. reopening worked? It’s sad don’t realize burying heads sand another way live fear. 

Idiots. 

On behalf us Americans masking staying in, I’d like express frustration well. :) understand notion, maybe that's case.

Though, developed played around evolution simulations, feels natural assume strategys develop own, regardless will, goal, supervision. also explains current situation satisfaction (trying apply Occam's razor).

People power _can_ it, comfortable them. _Why they?_ long keep check, will.

How populace ensure servants people actually serve people instead corporate even personal interests, mundane lazyness interest hide incompetence, real fear lose voters drastic necessary measures? normal standoffish, hermit loner lifestyle really paying dividends days. hope wrong sounds pretty plausible. Based research going ""infect everyone else including parents""? [RIVM children get infected usually spread although debated. [Stat news also whole lot nuanced Gotta love state absurd vagaries automated moderation here, can't really even discuss this, even though blatantly problem politics intersecting worsening crisis. 21 year old student die State College (PSU main campus) still marching full speed ahead in-person classes fall bringing 40,000 students campus 1 mile radius. live here. Fuck every selfish tourist right now. you’re reading visiting. Go fuck home Wow, read comment realized jerk sometimes. apologize hostility.

I hope country gets virus control soon get competent president soon. Agreed people important businesses money.

I implying advocating frightening people unnecessarily. sad plan wasnt complete shift civilization money aren't. Birth rates shockingly low US seeing population gains immigration.

 

Not surprising. Health care disaster. mandated maternity leave (the developed nation so), subsidized child care easily eat salary one partner. Middle class requiring two person income. Student loans keeping people children... words, disaster. would anyone want child economically ruinous so? Many opting out. guess could jerk apocalypse like people here. Yeah it’s pretty frustrating get funneled bullshit contractors like greyback pat rick. federal state orgs felony rules really need waived people inmate crews. tired state local governments heads buried sand pretending like there's still chance k-12 schools universities opening 6 weeks. 

They need accept reality begin planning online learning fall. quicker get shit planned, less difficult be. 

It's simple fact --- Florida seeing 10,000 new cases per day.... another dozen states seeing 1,000 new cases -- k-12 ain't gonna happen certainly can't millions college students traveling country school packing dorms... 

It safe smart. misleading. virus truly airborne would MUCH worse shape now. I'm glad Chinese worked transmission vectors virus unleashed labs. hope special place SELFISH. sharp decrease yesterday’s numbers. Clearly everything control.

Where’s apology? Wow got mad misread comment. Calm down. Imagine bad numbers would looked we'd widespread testing March/April! parties literally everywhere weekend ughh Like person said, it’s really choice. Let’s say town hit wildfire. shut manage suppress fire. Then, reopen fire still going, interferes suppression. People say, “that economically devastating, we’re shutting again, people don’t will.”

When fire engulfs town, won’t really “choice”. fire start cause economic disruption lockdown did. People scream, “why allowed happen? It’s destroying economy!”

We’re starting see “we’re never shutting wearing masks” Texas. Talked tough rubber hit road realized cornered.  Airbone Online classes never option making kids go school September? Mexico face face clases resume January 2021 possibility extension things improve. Sunday, holiday. So, 20K/ day next week? Boomers risk giving card world anything except travel need relax.

99.3% America diagnosed illness


Per CDC get it, 99.6% chance survival.

Stop destroying hands Pretty much. see someone else's problem, make ""if vulnerable, stay inside"" argument.

It's bullshit, course. world perfect. sneeze, cough talk wrong time infect someone luxury staying home work eat, sneeze next health care worker waitress going work, cough near child yet, undiagnosed immune disorder.

Thinking things obviously strong point lot people. I'm sure trying say, covering face needs mandatory, ridiculous. I’m reading comment almost two weeks later Florida south exploding cases. school opens early August. always amazes see someone sneeze open air. Even pre-covid. Like hard sneeze elbow, hands wash them. like wearing underwear willy. Well Excess Deaths, found using formula:

Current Regional Cause Mortality minus (average cause mortality time year region+known COVID deaths)=Excess Deaths 

Seems still PRETTY DAMN HIGH Illinois worrying might paint picture hard miscount COVID Deaths. Mix lag deaths you’re probably going see lot people know care die. least region sunbelt we’re seeing worst impacted areas rural spots. people aren’t partying non-existent bars. I’m guessing it’s spreading communal living family contacts don’t think one-size happening right now. regardless, still doesn’t explain deaths northeast aren’t happening sunbelt. California majority progressive voters, don’t think second don’t still house massive number regressive white supremacists. see plenty people neck woods drag kids supermarket without masks touching everything there’s isn’t global pandemic going on. went store employee scoffing customers wearing masks inside calling “plandemic” created embarrass trump. People pressing phones face, loudly taking it’s big deal, rattling fake statistics explain everyone ignore it, etc. population Tampa far many willing ignorant people testing limits stupidity. hate going restock inevitably cross paths ignoramuses. parents elderly wife pregnant don’t want bring illness home, many people happy ignore logic “mah freedums.” people disappeared planet, wouldn’t bother one bit. intellectual would tell necessary it’s fantasy work individualism exclusively creates ton toxic shit America.  

I’d also ask try month extremes see functional. looked New York thought “we’re better that.” thought liberal epidemiology. KNOW that? know cold coronavirus too? Check study done effectiveness masks colds. conducted way earlier cv-19 therefore 'skin game'.

 **Conclusion:** Face mask use health care workers demonstrated provide benefit terms cold symptoms getting colds. 

 8 symptoms recorded daily, subjects mask group **significantly** likely **experience headache** study period 

 

&amp;#x200B;

Plus true. they're saying 'airborne' even n95 mask cannot filter virus. virus way smaller. saying 'it helps cuz spreads water droplets much larger' apply OP's study correct.

Furthermore true significantly likely get headaches mask use study linked shown. indicates guys tested air inside mask correct. enough oxygen that's people get headaches using them:

 pretty well known fact. Dennis Rodman talked orgies podcast. would know? elected serve. That's also count, especially regard deaths untested cases. they’re going go feed stores amazon drink shit.
(Caution: don’t this. toxic large doses. must use gloves handle liquid invermectin) 

They need stop publishing stuff without hard trials show us works.

I can’t even find certain antibiotics poultry ivermectin used poultry dewormer cattle horse. Along used rx drugs treat prevent heartworm. It’s active ingredient. real truth NOBODY knows. We're getting started. Yes, think new seasonal illness real round 2 coming winter. We'll probably get vaccine sooner later contain it, comparable flu vaccine. us get eventually.

In 10 20 years it'll serious form common cold, reinfection likely probably less severe people growing already children bad adulthood. Yes did, native intelligence understand impact airborne transmission implys would look stupid right now. 

Here let spell words possible.

Airborne means infected eyes, even N95 mask protect transmission

Now care show class CDC recommends Mask eye protection? 60 0 covid victims hours!! Miracle! 0-1 death per day official order attract tourists back. (No citation common sense.) 

Then lie saying every tourist would get PCR airport arrival. said tourists PCR test money test police doctor-nurses imagine test tourists! HA!

Then say individual temperature check enough. calculated many people would need check tourists individually refused went group thermal cameras. (And airports!)

Spain 2019 83 million tourists make sure anyone coming infected. 

 glorious govt chose get fast cash stop world pandemic. Whats alternative though, keep bars restaurants closed next 2 5 years. 99% plus people attending nightclubs little risk getting seriously sick. fact amount people hiding behind keyboards stop younger people living. Try keeping food diary too. help find patterns regarding foods triggers. Personally, problems sweet things savoury things make want eat try make last thing eat evening. Glad Gef Talking Mongoose COVID-free days! Every single last one people needs locked put house arrest duration pandemic.  danger us all. That's fair analogy, although case, glitter probably penetrate homemade mask.

I’ve seen anecdotal same, tbh perspective, seems maybe us can’t get it. working covid positive people mask, never caught it. work public healthcare, almost half staff caught it. half asymptomatic. work us whole time, distancing, masks break rooms such... idk bunch us didn’t get doesn’t make sense how, unless we’re immune.... friemd house keeping, never wore mask forced him, covid units entire time, day everyday, never caught somehow. Managed catch flu somehow covid. Idk. It’s weird af tbh. I’ve never seen anything like it. thought things couldn’t get worse, wife asked watch Hamilton. try teetotal.

Well sharing plenty people within circle consider ""progressive"" ""leftists"" get-togethers since mid-march. restaurant coworkers getting shitfaced together turning around complaining lack mask wearing... adding politicizing pandemic stating one group people following rules, hey whatever need make feel like voting good guys... Thank you. enjoyed that. Sure, follow trying test prove it. end go tell everyone online it. That's rumors misinformation spreads. Trying call intentionally dense misinformation spreading scientific thought funny thing here... lol “A firm estimate could help governments predict many deaths would ensue virus spread control.”

Texas, Florida, Arizona soon providing prediction. mean safety measures prevention? virus airborne, seems like indoor space outside home would no-go foreseeable future. one aggressively enforced lockdowns country. Sunbelt spike obviously people completely irresponsible taking precautions. uhh, hence masks? like bring almost insignificant amount people protesting masks massive protests hundreds thousands people, good chunk masks wore incorrectly. Oh lot pepple would travel states protests. Sorry meant smaller. Please report him. live PA I'm sure part in. I'm Lehigh valley, heard friend girl got back Florida week ago works wawa preparing food. quarantine either. I'm ok people need held accountable. quarantine 3 months-doesn't mean can't still take precautions. pointed every time, important thing well even it’s 100% still makes difference. Say 25% people would travelled don’t. Maybe another 25% still travel actually 14 day quarantine. That’s big difference right potential importing cases. period woke mask every walk people could see there’s stigma. it’s like 90s humid every single day wear one go “public.” case Ivermectin, all. actually one several drugs flagged potential, effective lab studies done Australian researchers. Brazil, Peru, India reported anecdotal success it. studies, however, frustratingly slow get started it. keep mind people say ""defund police"" saying abolish police devolve chaos. protesters want City's budget stop 80% police related spending instead take funds fund social welfare resources would better equipped handle things listed above.  people want say defund police. mean that's literally viruses work though. mutate. virus without question go airborne airborne enough mutation. Thank input

Is Australia excepting American immigrants chance? mother passionately anti-mask law surprisingly chill companies requiring exact reason. It’s right require business. human garbage throws “Context important” 

but is. REALLY is. can't throw numbers try scare people. updated mortality see seems hover around 1-1.5% obviously official rate much deadlier still don’t know bad asymptomatic spread is. Plain simple, apartment buildings longer safe. guess they’re going ‘herd immunity’ vs. safe vaccine available. Sweden highest death rate... US started going path. 

Sweden still nowhere near numbers required herd immunity approach work well them.

Well, when.... 
How time... 
But cannot say....

I mean, hard defend country KNOW joke world right now. guess eat comment. 💨🍽🥴 Montrose resident here. Lots people crowding street watch fireworks. Saw couple bars (somehow considered restaurants) packed nearby. It’s ridiculous. don’t wear mask, guy. Maybe get it. Maybe not. Fuck around find out. hospital rotate super high covid numbers state that's seeing massive rises. know many patients see masks despite provided one? Pretty damn close zero. end stupidity forum. illuminati shit... Eastern Equine Encephalitis, EEE wonder time. husband make slightly average salary area live (USA), feel we’d never able afford kids. Luckily don’t want kids, doesn’t matter, always find talking earth acquaintances ever afford it? seem worse jobs us, families poor, somehow 3 kids always going family trips. God super depressing paying attention February.

Everyone joking around bumping elbows instead handshakes like somehow anything advice wash hands, don’t wear mask don’t change routines.

And July it’s super depressing again, different reasons, since know people deciding pretend like virus over. road Hillsborough County prospects aren’t much better. emergency group voted 5-3 mandate masks whole county, one three votes came one school board representative group.


So school board’s stance “We encourage masks won’t mandate them.”


AKA - “We scared provide actual leadership someone might come next meeting say mean things.” put mic in? exhaust? That's rhetorical question right? can't stupid ask. use lock key analogy describe virus enters cell. spike protein key. virus enters cell duplicate pattern continues. use fire escape stairs building now. yet see single person wear mask building. source control, yes, unless sneeze. Atlantic Canada?
If so, feel bubble Atlantic provinces opened up? apprehension folks? I’ll finally able rob people public peace. understand. lock there? Great. Every vaccine Coronavirus rushed. mentioned rushed vaccine India. way circular internal lines leaked. predictions living corona long time fail take account still choice ""living"" part. Bro pleeeease inform make claims like that. give privacy. even use gps. people download it, better. interviews, experts said aerosol transmission appears way explain several “super-spreading” events, including infection diners restaurant China sat separate tables choir members US state Washington took precautions rehearsal.

This literally linked article. still insane. matter pays, loudricous amount. don’t know, mask wearing widespread California also spiking. many southern metro areas high mask usage. don’t think spike simply “masks”. also can’t explain death rates remain low despite record infections. Airbone? Isn’t like MLM scheme?!? great ideas, worry amount restriction already place school prevent implementing them. 
We required keep doors windows closed locked times bc concerns school shooters. 
We’re also allowed outside 30 min/day, 4 days week. 
Just complicate fears even I’m district staff refusing come back wear masks, parents said kids wearing masks. 
I’m Florida it’s par course make sense w rules, it’s nightmare-scape going back fall. They’re France, believe. schools opened virus control. Chances take stairs physically exerting yourself, breathing harder, probably increase risk spreading catching it. want keep schools closed, gonna monthly stimulus checks, families going forgo half salary cant leave kids home &lt;12 so. Pay reward fine Ok, serious question, shift ""Flatten curve allow hospitals handle load"" ""Keep everything closed cure""?

I remember early on, everyone talking hospitals overwhelmed China Italy need keep numbers reasonable level. agree 100% following safety protocols accordingly.

However, I've noticed increasingly discussion seems moved past ""Do resources"" ""Avoid COVID costs"".
I talking cafe owner day - takeout right now. asked going seating soon, following state guidelines, said ""Not vaccine!"".
This seems foolhardy - one, may never vaccine. fact, odds be. 
Second, area low infection rate, 100 active cases state hospitals plenty room. 
Our state guidelines health officials saying OK run business carefully, guy waiting vaccine.
It's him, either - see tons people posting social media holing done.

What plan people belief? 

To me, kind like hiding cold flu - impossible unless hermit. eventually going get it, prepared try spread around got it. infectious airborne virus particles? Usually get super dry air due lack water surrounding them, number particles low airborne. wonder much risk is. Florida teacher too, county (a super hot spot) leaning toward distance learning return. make announcement soon, cannot imagine returning classroom pandemic rages. don’t think it. miss students, know in-person learning superior, worth risking health. : ( Ok perspective many health care workers usually die 6 months normal years? many year died illnesses? many healthcare workers died something health related? People die time every reason. 700 health care workers, including bottom right top guy, throughout US insignificant. back too. trend I’m seeing good 2 months comes back. think Europe September. #WEAR FUCKING MASK!!!! mean except mutations already occurred? saw post day fixing this. 

The solution fix voting system. Make proportional. vote proportionally people worry splitting vote. They're able vote policies actually care about. current system voting basically Markov chain vote occurs means leader top previous one craziness. system breeds extremism successive campaign crazier last. unstable. order return stable system needs new election system prevents extreme politicians generated. need politicians reach voters center instead voters fringes. wants take world michrochips puts vaccines!

Once chipped get infected 5G slowly turn lizard people! WAKE UP! Meanwhile FL group protesting beach closure yesterday ran onto beach, masks..and demanded open. bunch dumb F****  implying gathering huge crowds people yelling shouting isn’t risk factor spreading virus? thing remember hospitals indeed scandalous (not them) writing deaths Corona virus deaths get additional funding it. 

No one ever know actual amount Corona deaths number far lower reported. 

It proven several locations hospitals reporting deaths Corona even receive money.

You get mad deny want, hospital is, unfortunately like anything else, BUSINESS. 

And expensive business run corrupt wealthy people things GOING HAPPEN EVENTUALLY. 

It conspiracy political opinion, fact system let continue. 

Corona killed FAR FAR FEWER reported, including professionals. ""The entire California State University system announced in-person classes shut amid switch remote learning.""

Hoping Arizona State same. miss outbreak Kawasaki disease like symptoms caused severe illness killed number children covid 19 complications? Well, tell US control every first world country virus control. thought COVID lockdown would perfect time read Stand again, yeah. blame Mr. Braverman showing us Day 9th grade, start lifelong addiction. whole bubble concept weird me. astronauts signed this. military operation force compliance isolation. people families life. want miss brothers wedding? father's funeral, kids first steps? People treating athletes like they're slaves shoved bubble entertainment. Yeah work high school I’ll tell things open current guidelines (no class size cap, three feet apart, masks grade 2 recommend etc) won’t going back.
And kids online.

If take reasonable precautions consider returning.

I’m told requiring masks means district provide.
They’re giving teachers 5 per week !!!
And nurse ten per week !!

1300 kids high school, let alone adults, like around 500 kids’ elementary.

Fuck that.  Yep. seems purpose act defeated either dearth misappropriation funds. Considering much money involved, doubt former. gamers reddit tell trust everything China tells us, listen own, superior, science minded politicians absolutely believe truth. US literally held exercise almost exact pandemic scenario year ago ignored everyone leadership. That's call near-perfect corporate media effect.

There's nothing wrong journalism, fact, cornerstone democracy. seen much journalism long long time. Needed fully protect wearer, carriers masked even cotton, cloth catches far particles breathing unmasked. universal adoption face masks important. rely much everyone else wearing masks protected wearing one yourself. Given two options (a) mask (b) wear mask covers mouth nose, preferable? 

That question asking. Let's perfect enemy good. turns (b) better (a), least start getting people (b), instead criticizing them. “They’re putting database” complaint **on Facebook** fucking rich. hire talent, likely organization.  can't they're really good slobbering people really close range there's source that? would like read it. People really know answer that? forget refuse vaccine bill gates wants track microchips! I’m lost point. saying schools reopen US despite cases rising sharply?

We’re saying students don’t benefit school, saying it’s safe open schools right given strong portion US non-compliant measures need employ. Euro love based fact states getting higher daily rates infection entire European Union.

What want us refute? death rate France? That’s really point conversation. Didn’t doctors agree use “fight” word describe struggle? 44 cases entire province one month. less two new cases per day. liar, use conditionals apparently compensates everything except assertion following current CDC protocols sufficient.  lot pent-up demand. So, Disney probably trouble filling parks reduced capacity 10%, 25% 50% typical crowd levels reopen. according new Disney CEO Bob Well know masks cut oxygen OSHA says safe. Plus masks prevent transmission viruses, per Dept. Labor. That's reasoning I've seen, show studies refute ridiculous assertions, well, left wing lib sheep. 

Ignorance may bliss sure blissful surrounded idiots. That's good point important consider ""average joe"" generally smart (about things least). like morons dont understand difference term ""scientific *theory*"" ""theory"" (generalized). Yup.

My distributor fulfill pre-pandemic quantity. able save little lockdown less trauma admissions less surgeries helped us save up.

But able grow sufficient enough stockpile.

And costs skyrocketed well cleaning products we're also difficulty sourcing.

So we're paying lot amount - amount cannot keep actual use demands - hospital bringing less money we're performing less elective surgeries make money. go pub go socialise. social distance rules place even point going pub? I'm staying clear continue drinking friends houses instead. Nothing appeals shouting tables pub. morning dose matter many people let burn this. 

The people wealth going go spend it.  retired people. 

The stock market doomed. see economy longer term.  Multiple WTO reports months. Last time read one rate 6%. Also, fun fact, ~13% require oxygen supply. kind thinking made USA laughing stock world. Use critical thinking find US different rest world already controlling spread virus. masks don’t work surgeons might well stop wearing surgery. theory 100 years practice using masks medicine keep people safe, thrown drain someone Facebook said don’t work. Curious know virus water borne spread via small bodies water swimming pool? I've considered taking one old CPAP masks sticking filter hose would attach, imagine would look weird Yup nurse friend mine last month huge party house husband gotten covid days prior one wearing masks. contrary 50M infected April 15th according ~150k death count CDC’s 0.26% IFR.

How sad truly deplorable that? Still lower holiday weekends past 3 months. Say louder people back brother Yep, know someone thinks we're counting every death covid 19 even aren't. kid used read lot apocalyptic/post apocalypse themed books, pandemic definitely reminiscent books. often expect worst COVID one first

""Some must die keep markets ,"" think comes community spread. able track cases grow rapidly. cases track it’s okay. isolate trace control spread. it’s need lock eventually. 100 cases get control faster reopen quickly. wait 10000 it’s much bigger problem. It’s clear won’t resolve waiting. ""The lack Katana collection disgusts me. couple weeks ago, everything going down. spike hospitalizations seems precede spike deaths. death spike never comes muted would put better treatments. fact experiencing hospitalization spike right suggests probably looking less severe strain.

We exactly waitress (who covid denier) hug everybody wearing mask. returning week long trip. Florida. went bars, restaurants, family gatherings, horseback riding. Yikes.  2nd child April regret nothing. owe family develop purposeful, hopeful outlook. might. new cases 40- almost 0 death rate. Combine new effective treatments expect deaths jump much. Hahaha! Yeah, is, don’t want acknowledge means you’re responsible actions decisions. Scientists found conversation spreads much virus coughing. Wait ? yelling right thing WTF wrong people ? Like tell children time half people ( guess ) country idiots . Please stay away don’t argue idiots ! I’m sure we’re discussing completely agree everything said. I’m anal general vibe sub. That’s families work. There’s expectation kids helping around house ways well (chores, etc). 

Not sure big hangup is. 15 helping younger brothers, earning extra babysitting people’s kids. Florida's Leadership - US' Leadership - wanted. 

It's shame. could prevented least try prevent wearing mask. 

But, can't hurt Trump's feelings now. 

More importantly, virus suppose hoax? well something would disappeared summer? 

Yeah, keep listening Orange Moron - look got you. said (for reassurance) long mom healthy weight body fat, she’ll fine. Dying COVID-19 overweight correlate .95, may even low; could .99.

Awesome conspiracy theories.

If want get reset human rights abuses, look population incarcerated. understand still that’s extremely low I’m CA remember those. live SD rally Mt. Rushmore. don’t 200 ICU beds statewide. Yesterday, crossed river, saw sand bars Missouri River packed full people. county total 8 ICU beds. We’re fucked. one political party pretends give fuck BLM. another political party pretend give fuck BLM. Neither party give public wants- meaningful police reform. parties suppressing vote manipulating counting ballots. People paying attention trust results. literally nothing left us hold accountable except protest. alternative also massively expensive? Checked medical costs lately? think word they're looking ""everyone"". 0.26 number based study John Ioannidis, almost got fired Stanford Med bogus methodology. 

50M number hope based Stanford study Santa Clara county they've apologized one well.

I really hope right, everything I've seen points IFR 0.5-0.7% confirmed cases ~10-15% actual infections. 

Which would imply right ~25M infected there's long way go. “But dose fires hydroxychorloquine!” dorms like cruise ships, except everyone also fucking other. go home families tgiving give grandma grandpa virus. that's huge lock months.

It’s almost like cross bridges waterway onto Gulf Blvd, you’re entering alternate “Pandemic? Pandemic?” reality. I’ve taken couple longer drives Siesta Key area things aren’t different along coast either. 

I’m walk around talk people find exactly they’re thinking, especially angrily harassed one wearing mask back April. whether it’s locals people coming vacation, feels like there’s definite DGAF attitude near Gulf since started (I’d imagine many people choosing come vacation past weeks fall DGAF category). Seeing scenes restaurants particular lately rage inducing. long lock effective

You nailed concern quite squarely.

I think Alberta like Florida China. :(

Time tell. anyone tell clean/disinfect grocery deliveries? know put aside four days perishables things really want four days? spraying/wiping could scrub soap water, would much prefer that!

I think wrong whole time want know others doing. gotten sick groceries yet good thing. Many people skeptical numbers coming China it’s called abuse 2020 No, sorry. People don’t take precautions end fatally infecting someone Coronavirus sent prison like cops shoot whenever black man something startled them. VA there? basically two literally right next other. 4th mission take civilians needed, surge needed, likely end too. celebrate idealize greed, cruelty, selfishness.

We create ""let's together"" spirit. people would start celebrate more. would make people feel part something important. Breathing fresh air healthy lungs. scientific fact. one busiest airports, busiest US. 

Sixth busiest world, third busiest US. ATL absolutely destroys passengers per year ~110 million. teachers designing implementing synchronous asynchronous distance learning? mean one hospitals listed 13 ICU beds total begin with, surprise increase need would full. like ""For flu, done done... ain't worry 99%+ son!"" 8 mins 46 seconds What? USADA's relationship UFC started 2015. may drug testing since 2000 protocol completely changed 2015 rigorous random testing No, commenting that. debating issue, offering observations. rate think linked article inconsistent observations - never claimed data falsified, said may significant timelags possibly problems it. see scroll up, thing trying say discussion completely legitimate criticize official statistics. Discussions veracity official statistics data shut (as important, indeed vital discussions). offered observations Swedish data. certainly perfect. That's all. like 👍 unsustainable right? Florida’s numbers growing. 2 3 weeks now, number people needing ICU beds grown too. feel like bizzaro world one acknowledges rapid pace reopening NJ NY putting us risk. Thank sanity check. Nope Deaths reported Sundays Mondays typically low due lags weekend. Expect big number Tuesday. NYT posted article yesterday outdoor activities. Also note: addition majority folks wearing masks, people protest generally walking/moving, lessens exposure risk.  neither. get looks guilt make eye contact mask less person. Never laghture jeering though. Florida, masks, vacation. asked one wearing masks, one person responded “we don’t got here”...in county nearly 1,000 cases added 24 confirmations yesterday...

Needless say, avoiding people like plague here. see online, Scientologists using crisis recruiting moment, putting pamphlets give advice sanitation taking care others. However, medical advice insane see. School boards charge medical decisions--the fact they're via poll tells qualified make decisions. Excellent :)

Hope remains. necessarily. 2 weeks short time span. everyone infected time, obviously time increases odds catching it.  expect 2nd round shutdowns.

I expect 2nd round stimulus checks Kiss death look around man. everywhere.. No.

That’s balance risk police violence vs risk severe respiratory virus spreads like wildfire.

In late May, police violence dangerous. US records 100,000 new COVID cases day, balance could change. Yeaterday July 4th everyone, likely reporting deaths. explains low number. deaths reported week... Polio rampant smallpox. eventually controlled, smallpox eradicated completely.

SARS-CoV-2 controlled well, even without vaccine. vaccine eradicated. Nothing says wait herd immunity let half percent population die process. That’s true. I’ve seen lot discussion things sub, particularly impact COVID-19 necessary healthcare. You’re getting way conspiracy theory dude. good news is, long she’s healthy weight body fat, fine; it’s really killing overweight obese people. true....and sad. retired &amp; imagine go back behavior issues &amp; new procedures etc exhausting. Plus a.c philly schools. really like described getting ""burnt become lifer"", true. Many changes coming &amp; stay well!!! news: schools going end going back remote. 

Most states guidelines say student faculty member pops positive shut 14 days. happen 100% schools multiple times. 

Those guidelines still end shutting infection spreads enough people school. 

There's real avoiding it. Schools shut prolonged periods fall. Covid loves super spreaders sacrifices. going post question apparently can’t post text. 

Is app exists helps find and/or maintain social bubble?

I know plenty like-minded people taking virus seriously isolating best can. lot people alone. time, countless stories people formed “social bubbles” people trusted equally isolate themselves, find people aren’t holding end bargain end exposing bubble. app takes away risk simply trusting someone allowing users voluntarily tracked? 

I’m usually proponent apps track users due obvious abuses large companies, hence “voluntary.”

An example - quite families small children isolating, children missing socializing others, important factor healthy childhood development. app might used like-minded, responsible parents link get socialization needed children (and themselves!), tome, proving (as best typical phone prove) they’ve stayed home away others. living alone who’d like someone hang while. lol think care ""the media"". care bogeyman conjured whole cloth order feel superior. No, care reported data, studies, medical consensus. know, facts.  Here's hoping! Bunkerboy decided “fuck it, let run rampant” three months ago; didn’t tell anybody... People wore masks could enforce law punished didnt. Abbott took away us we're boned. Illinois, masks required kids attend school fall. least downstate, massive pushback it, including Million Unmasked March capital planned later month. Shocker. Even harder one's trying!

(I'm US, though) Manager del Taco work says people throw things yell employees it. support high school. absolutely want schools open, especially Arizona (where work). sure saying? thought 1) water/virus droplets less 5 microns considered airborne 2) water evaporates quickly leaving airborne virus easily picked air currents.

I haven’t read anything says virus poofs air without initial water vector. misinformation travels fast gullible, true verified information also travels fast skeptical ready open minds new information comes. would actually argue spreading misinformation may almost bad virus itself. implications fact scary.

I think obligation combat misi formation effective way try promote truth wherever possible. Karens gotta Karen... CHECK POST!!! No, there's new set physics. change anything droplet transmission, much bigger factor spreading disease. already knew virus particles stay air (because know fluid dynamics). big question mark still same: circumstances viral load airborne particles enough cause infection. airborne, airborne, wear mask, dont epwear mask, nobody knows do. video Dr Fauci back April says health officials need masks sure rates, choice hotel.

If curious, link info www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/factsheets/Pages/hotel-quarantine.aspx wouldn’t even bad kept themselves, spreading stupid. stupid spread virus decent folk. It’s bad. wife Teacher Quebec. schools opened 6 weeks. worse province case nothing happened schools. seems virus care 12 yo less.

They even cases parents tested positive (they got work), removed kids school prevention (obviously), kids never tested positive even parents got it. 

After experienced here, worry anymore school reponening. Also, families teachers health workers probably first access vaccine available too. lot 130k deaths. Remember china massively underxounted cases deaths. countries poor wont know person dies covid not. got caught last part wave Texas ""reopened"" hadnt really got hit hard after. mention city live (Brownsville) couldnt enforce mask laws place Abbott said couldn't. curfews, mask laws, traveling restrictions passengers cars se pretty much told let guard enough. first COVID-19 death March even 6 months yet. 3 weeks since trend change cases, 2 weeks since second major spike reported cases. Haha yeah Canadian clients fled south Florida way back March. would anyone want stuck America pandemic pay-to-live healthcare system.

They won’t back snowbird season either. would surprised many American snowbirds came, even. It’s going weird year, least traffic light! husband teacher. state starting first wave, increasing cases 100 every day. closed schools March, kids graduated online. Summer school happen. now, district leadership (because state refuses give any) decided school starts next month buildings. Masks requested, teachers may say require classes.

However, state ALSO declared masks mandatory UNLESS can't wear one medical purposes one allowed ask reason.

My husband high risk category. catches it, he'll die. require masks worn classroom. One colleagues still thinks overblown really problem. requiring masks classroom.

Like teachers, husband's medical insurance tied job. School policy says gets sick, 10 weeks. Luckily, 6 months sick leave. catches coronavirus, could kill him. state stated new teachers built-up sick leave that, sick days, use state sick day pool. get 2 weeks expected go back work. don't, assumed quit without notice. leaves without unemployment options.

It's early July first wave getting started. 5-digits time school supposed start. hope cause state change minds 4-digit spot, reach mid- late-July. far, everyone treating like bad. everyone state literally lost loved one health permanently impacted, continue say problem.

And know impacted dogs too, US would everything could isolate, protect, mask every time needed leave house. bitch freedoms? redneck put gun face demand put fuckkng mask nose, Karen. hunting dogs threatened privilege. 

But affect pets. Yet. people. apparently, people infecting worth protecting. Faroese dictionary changed inn :P Exactly find funny child sex abuse? phrase used correctly, appear confused meaning true, saying can't (or tried) prove true. least there's anything even makes slightly different.

It's extremely toxic individualism basically brainwashed acting like protagonist video game.

They real person matters, everyone else video game characters.

That's hard wear masks: mildly inconveniences absolutely benefit 'real' people.

So store asks wear masks right freedom interfered with. also risking people, store owner/manager also decide make business completely irrelevant.

While people complaining shops serving customers bigoted reasons, they'll say stores right serve 'gay' customers.

So basically right them, responsibilizies everyone tiny ingroup. country resumed normal classes back May, apart sick students, somehow infect classmates, alright. long every safety precaution taken, alright Might violate local fire code so, depending many exits clinic &amp; are. interpreting data incorrectly. lower test-positivity-rate indicative widespread testing suggests infected people tested. NY, peak infections, enough testing go around, 41% tests positive. Today Massachusetts, virus somewhat control testing widespread, test-positivity-rate &lt; 2%. Lower positive rate better, scare you. shit stain complainers denied entry make sure least wear mask yourself. Get cool black one something. Middle class neighbourhoods don’t nine people living two bed room flat shared laundry facilities. Delta owns Aeromexico. FYI. LOL first amendment covers literally speaking mouth, also covers freedom expression. Stop high mighty. July still without adequate supplies PPE. would typical year? NZ collectively worked together collective good. 

It's literally normal NZ right month. Airborne* general hypothesis. New York enacted strict lockdown measures early on. Symptomatic carriers followed guidelines pretty well. left asymptomatic carriers spread. basically “generations” viral spread selectively breeding less symptomatic strains favor transmissible less lethal strains. Medicaid covers vast majority costs Americans certain income. think average pay 1 percent pocket. good everyone. 

If income level, though, need significant resources, even insurance. looking minimum 4-5k pocket whole pregnancy, seems excessive given pay hundreds dollars insurance every two weeks. afford it, but, man, would nice money offset baby expenses. Would anyone actually think differently?? Drunk people piss street, would even try social distance ? personification values trump. guess guys school test subject. Good luck! Unfortunately also infect relatives, coworkers, people interact them. Older teachers might retire year avoid death. map hurts look though, Wisconsin higher Minnesota Michigan? Artificial assignment value health paid paper dollars people artificially assign value to.    Yeah saw YouTube video qualified medical practitioner!! Another teacher here. Kids back class, limited class sizes. keeping windows door open times, os pretty good circulation. possible winter governemnt planning resuming class regular class sizes starting September. looking forward it. Still broken teeth thrown beer bottle audacity deliver pizza 5 minutes late.

And knife scar hand restaurant temporarily run blue cheese.

I *zero* doubt customers shittier reported, say ""get different job."" 🙄 I’m begging mom teach anymore. lives Georgia town she’s takes whole joke. 90% people public don’t wear masks. wrong, Americans cant say going Alaska go vacation. allowed go Alaska Alaskan citizen returning home lower 48. analysis overblown entirely incorrect. freedom important. freedom not. Maybe start laying teachers don’t want work. pay lot taxes salaries. Coronavirus around us long time. 2021, 2022? Can’t keep everything shutdown forever.  taxes coming in, layoffs. 

How many teachers attended massive protests last month. saying can’t teach? brag? last forever

Only 4 years. Unless he's somehow able away 2 term maximum thing, dunno enough american law. know pandemic stupid people can't help show world stupid are, I'm betting every one people votes trump back purely cause nobody expects people dumb whole club lookin They'd already first wave? left 1 5, possibly 1 4 places, antibodies? would wear underwear like that.

Turn around 1-2 days. Sometimes get results sent 4 AM, midnight, 2 PM. truly working overtime. Much respect folks labs enabling important work. true. lot parents special needs kids see schools centers ""break."" around special needs children since teenager. (My little sister autistic DD's, 14 years us.) 


I figure many teachers/aids get sick can't find subs schools close again. 

I seen parents hissy fits ""normal"" kids ""recommend"" wear mask two days week! (Eye roll) 

He bring home positive awards box, since can't share toys. trying figure plan keeping system going. behavioral students. 

He going try ""outside"" classroom much possible. give bigger room due spacing issues. went last week shoved everything new room, hopes cancel school.  Whoa whoa whoa slow pal. earth 2,000 years old dinosaurs hoax. nothing learn Neanderthals, America! Sounds like need quarantine apart schools open. genuinely don’t think US schools open past
October.

But also think enough teachers like wife bail out, they’ll forced stay distanced learning. think reason world won’t excuses leaders used use aren’t going fool anyone anymore. US, basically set fail. makes sense continue things way creates gaping weak points event crisis. see lot people socially distanced. Ok, acknowledge parts country shitbags. sorry hear that. hope situation improves somehow, even requires mandated lockdowns situations get controlled. believe virus incapable killing 99.7%+ hosts deadly? humble opinion, doesn’t cause anxiety depression. think parents making mistake assuming kids fine/ok suggesting encouraging ways make connections. Zoom great tool interact friends, actually talking phone great too. RPG, video games interact others awesome. parents talk frustrations actually listen helpful. bleah.....the us U&amp;#$(#$ resident seeing stupidity, wonder people listening politicians scientists. pure stupidity political issue people choosing literally die ""No Masks freedom"" hill states well going continue way long. They've opened inevitably see surges. New York already back 1000 cases day now. True, death free. point they're mostly obese. high risk.

Read original post... 

What's point reply? pretty much summed up. people views world would better situation hell might've even gotten rid virus without vaccine dumb mother fucker problem. not""sick people getting sicker"". Young, healthy people getting killed virus, even die left seriously disabled life. 

On top that, catch it, even mild symptoms, spread older people fucking kill them. idiotic, selfish idea basically fucking murder. Hm that's interesting. Especially considering tex-mex, absolutely terrible everywhere besides Texas (tried Edinburgh, London, Geneva, NYC... terrible different ways) lol. agreed probably biased since lived smaller towns Scotland would compare small towns US, really know besides ones I've gone BBQ tourism (there's couple towns Texas known BBQ people drive hour to). 

My favorite restaurant town ik Scotland small Indian restaurant owned operated family 20 years better Indian food US UK. Agreed probably would find local places live big enough cities UK actually get enough transplants. cautious person world, would take split second inattention touch public surface, face, never ever think interaction rest life, think ""But never touched anything strange touched face! safe!""

Average person factor this, really. Every time leave home, running risk, matter precautions take. wonder many people wear gloves masks think transition removing gloves removing mask, sanitizing hands transition. Sorry stupid friend. see firework display citizens California last night. Newsome must thrilled. I'm talking kind people insisted protests would cause explosion cases, yet two week mark passed dug told everyone wait two weeks. Finally shut became incontrovertibly clear [there corresponding case one thing hypothesize X might cause happen two weeks. deadline passes, abandon hypothesis. keep saying ""just wait two weeks"", advancing hypothesis, preaching apocalyptic eschatology. company anti Christian? PILLOW asshole, Hobby Lobby ? help understand. still droplet borne, basically saying droplets vapor virus persists much longer originally reported within vapor, takes smaller amount infect people otherwise reported. correct? *""We've got customer full-on fallopian fungus. baking loaf virus think covi.""* kind car COVID-19?

A standard passenger car? medical mask standard 3 point seat belt?

Or F1? medical mask still 3 point seat belt?

Or actual clue mostly talking ass varying efficacy different mask types preventing projection virus containing droplets? last time checked, redesigned medical masks since COVID-19 became thing. Safety reality fairytales superstitions. Definitely reddit thing, I've seen headlines lately shitting Hamilton. Same. Everyday slammed open close I'm one building wearing mask gloves. hate it. 4 months shutdowns. 6 months count knowing January. 8 months count briefings back November... saying. We've creative discharging Bayfront lol  I’ve seen Americans get winded taking elevator. Several countries managed contain spread. They've taken careful measures actually gotten control. several countries not.

So, would appear based actual experience taking seriously make huge difference. Good Lord, sounds like something poorly written comedy. Given everything else year too, bet starts widespread scam coming months. Tons parties south Florida majority people wear masks nose exposed chin. love remind game :) Hope send apology don’t slink away. 

Otherwise please explain correlation cases deaths May now. worldometers report 190k? go one thread without making us? 

Thanks enough teachers bail they’ll keep schools closed fan president ALL. said, saying true, would pushing hydroxychloroquine hard (which also relatively old drug inexpensive)? think reason world won’t leaders can’t go back old excuses. least US, basically set fail. cannot system gaping vulnerabilities anymore. anything life? Markov chain? R0 similar droplet spread viruses, much lower airborne viruses? work doctor many use N95 that’s it, far haven’t positive cases. could asymptotic able fight virus easily. also mention Doctor 30/40s one super old. actually ""doesn't drink water"" part makes cringe drinking alcohol every day. imagine color guy's average piss? Ew. basically inside super safe outside likely fine masks shortage respirators made governments lie instead telling true story. explain taking Florida's death toll per million surge starts really hit putting next New York's surge already hit academically dishonest. one ever cared teachers truth. job think hit cussed nothing happens. serious complications, right? normal, early delivery ended costing $1 million?

(Asking ""emergency birth"" benign ""birth occur when/where originally planned"") going track them?

YOu see things called computers, put info seconds. ""Health officials deep South Texas urging community “to take immediate action reduce spread COVID-19,” social distancing, masks hand-washing.""

""Dr. Jose Vazquez, Starr County health authority. Vazquez counterpart Hidalgo County, Dr. Ivan Melendez, tested positive COVID-19 week.""

Clearly even health officials getting it, time slightly aggressive approach urging community. fuck else one say something stupid??

""I want divorce"".  Yeah think 20-30% realistic. 50-80% deniers throwing sounds good I'd love proven case, seems good true. policy recommendation came much later pandemic. Went Vegas last week Disney reopening Florida week ya won’t take long. Car crash reports investigate accident. Plus times fights scenes. 

I agree vandalisms break ins. really need cop. 

Cops sent cats trees, thinking Fire Dept. 

Blocking traffic, that's petty think police that. People pay attention cops directing traffic, believe me. 

Everything else easier said done gave guidance counselor social worker deal them. calls go 0-100 real quick. work police close let tell you, social workers put harms way even major police presence. 

Social workers great quit acting like social workers end problems face. defunding psychiatric services, drug rehabilitation services, liabilities schools staff breaking fights. local paper said get physician's referral... right? picked right time move middle Hawaiian jungle 14 acres nearest human. mean one referenced article that’s basis discussion? one written 200 doctors WHO? 

But guess Reddit comment approximately par doctors scientists. vocal minority equal majority. problem social media. Small numbers seem bigger reality. I’m worried family first foremost that’s immediately important life, 7 month old we’ve locked since end March. kids school likely resilient transmission vessel. worry spreading like wildfire. also teach next cancer survivor 60s. issue returning it’s safe far safe. 100% believe distance education answer 2020-2021 states need flexible days required school year. Indiana firmly said waiver days (20 last year) 51% days must physically classroom. also include warnings places, like state New Mexico, require 14-day quarantine enter. would help making travel plans. Yes do. it’s bit hassle since tries face recognition times fails switch typing hit 6 digits. smooth looking phone pays God doesn’t want I’m sure “don’t buy masks” “it’s airborne” absolutely nothing distrust institutional establishments. Must Facebook’s fault. people dying infected state reopened. Let’s wait see Illinois looks like end July, shall we?

Just long remember then, it’ll weeks late fix turns you’re wrong. So, begs question: talk/type Thanks, anything take another hit, lol. Stay safe! doesn’t matter. People emergencies like heart attacks, strokes, car accidents, SOL. That’s matters- people die result unable get care hospitals already swamped patients. It’s taking hours transport people can’t find hospital drop at. means ambulances also can’t respond emergencies wait. call 911 one comes hours- lots people die this. afraid, afraid. 🙄 think rights enumerated? Curious think rights enumerated? Curious Essentially nothing changed status virus, yet teachers expected deal schools open. 
That fair anyone. School boards need stop trying force things ‘back normal’. It’s going happens. think structure idea schools. realize army military general one best trained world? degree biochemistry. have? leader students need be. Trump said done fighting coronavirus Pence said final embers dying disease.

Clearly, need test less. Shoulda

Coulda

Won't Yeah whole subreddit people fear mongering, regurgitating heard MSNBC, thinking actually know subject experts. beautiful thing watch. Sad, beautiful. live northern Idaho. Work long term care facility. wear mask stop get something. that's it. get crazy looks people keep ten feet away mask. Hell, lady infant stood stared solid minute. mother car said folks glaring me. Weird town. coworkers nursing? dont think bad, hoax, they're getting major carbon monoxide poisoning masks. potential case. went room nothing gloves mask. None provided face shields gowns. One even tried argue ""Its unfair, wants leave room get out, please, little bit, hes dying outside room."" Shits making incredibly mad. negotiate (bio-)terrorists. Unless we’re talking children cages we’re talking ‘summer camps’ avoiding phrase ‘concentration camps’ costs. Yeah. It’s weird people going “but person learning better! American pediatrics told me!” Like we’ve known this. It’s common argument used (for many years) homeschooling online charter schools. It’s new revelation. Schools didn’t close teachers strike every parent withdrew them. closed ongoing pandemic. pandemic issue. 
My friend handing diplomas next week Florida. Despite everything they’re still person graduation restrictions (why). Change entire system fit human race, individuals. that's pipedream dystopia. matrix money couple billionaires would cult classic right wing neo would terrorist old folks home. would say old folks home getting hit virus consider forming committee see take seriously Uh oh. Many us knew this. However UK general media cannot push type information. getting back ""normal"" UK. government shut economy them. climate change deficit. 

It think young enough healthy enough even catch bad, symptoms all. infecting others, problem. risk isolating themselves. 

That entire rationale. sub strong condemning lack proper government response (rightfully so) sudden Trumpster level defensiveness comes millennial's responsibilities. causes autism. Oh, carbon monoxide poisoning, civil servitude. New York = 1,657 dead per 1m

Florida = 177 dead per 1m

I figure FL catch NY about....*two weeks* Western Washington great. Verrrrry slow reopening. Mask mandate people
complying. Cases still going up, slowly. media corporations politicians ~~have pushed anti-intellectualism agenda decades.~~are corrupt can't trust word, word, them.

FTFY. Holy shit graduate high school.

Look mucus membrane sound big words out... damn high-school owes country refund apology. Gavin Newsom one simple trick Los Angeles report data last days implement ""*improvements data processing systems*."" try Miami, I'm sure would produce fairly steep decline. Great sourcing, thanks. Yeah, morning went ahead deactivated Facebook.  reduced testing volume, maybe fifteen? wife dreading making kids wear masks/social distancing teachers district told clean high touch surfaces classes (who time that?). We're pretty low income area, culture dislikes blows education. Every year, wife restart power dynamic old enough naturally start power classroom. can't imagine trying get kids trust enough wear masks, also getting wear masks (or sanitize class whatever). Add hybrid classrooms strange mix online/hybrid/in-person task seems nearly impossible. Retirement age, financial state.  means even wearing mask, virus enter body trough eyes. Apple offer password ""connect dots"" certain pattern unlock screen? part pandemic politicized Canada. Conservative premiers working cooperating Liberal Prime Minister, one suggesting masks sort political statement, one withholding funds/support/equipment bestow upon agree them. Politicians generally deferring public health experts regardless whether conservative liberal. Masks outward spread also protect wearer inward infection. reduce probability happening, also filter virus reduces viral load get infected.

It need N95. 2-layer 3-layer cloth mask Etsy. work help everyone.

Just putting part truth there. small college Portland Oregon running currently strict social distancing protocol.

Here video president talk Wow, even higher risk group covid. morons determined drag us them. Dude really hoping gonna like disappear comment section turn huge fucking debate Let introduce bayonet I’m sure anecdote worth, run online Survivor game players range teens 30 somethings, teenagers I’ve series conscientious would feel really awful gave someone COVID. they're actually precautionary reactionary. US waits things already going poorly implementing proper responses, late even measures taken. countries understand that's stupid way fight contagious disease. .. point sucker born every minute.

Sucker. didn't, asked questions. fucked...DFW w/ chronic pain (waiting surgery) well cardiovascular cardiac issues. Going doctors appointments terrifying.

Did anyone else see 8 month pregnant IG fitness influencer went semi-viral FB snapping pics w/ large group anti-mask friends Lake Travis (Austin, TX) couple weeks ago?? made post laughing others wearing masks working beach. Hope baby’s okay. Absolutely. came willfully broke rules. Theoretically could've killed thousands started community spread. can’t much money doesn’t even full suspension mountain bike.  people wealth NEVER went spent it. Trickle economics myth. That's wealth problem. number people asymptomatic whose symptoms insufficient send hospital get tested. estimate many untested survivors are, include figuring ""worst case scenario"" 100% exposure. 

If get viable vaccine, looking around 3.3 million Americans dead Covid19. possible 20% rural population could avoid exposure, would reduce deaths further, death rates higher hospitals overwhelmed can't treat folks die without hospital care. two factors probably roughly cancel out.

Right Belgium worst hit nation whose population million (the tiny nations volatile). 10% population tested, .5% have/had tested positive Covid19, .08% died Covid19. Obviously. 08/.5 16%, big chunk population probably know, .5% real denominator death rates.

Another way think is: experts expecting 1% people get die, people experts say hoax wear mask... Allow wonder DPRK’s internal propaganda western world bizarre western world’s propaganda it. That's fault messaging tho. know lot Fauci trying get whatever tidbits truth public could without getting fired. started everyone thought it'd two weeks. people think always going two weeks responded late. 

The reality never going 2 weeks 2 months. always going consistent lockdown cycle year vaccine made. message right gate March, think things would've much better now. 

If fed states cohesiveness message country need shutdown months stop countless deaths, non issue. we'd probably already back normal aspects life. Rather actually did, flatten curve month reopen fast instead ruined 4 months near nationwide quarantine matter like week. simpleton’s interpretation “airborne” “aerosol” opening misinformation. science community’s quibbling semantics don’t translate well general public. Americans need baby sitters I'm Columbia SC superintendent also Covid-19 positive...this gonna ridiculous. Droplets enter body trough eyes btw. honestly gotten far pandemic knowing deaths lag spikes patients two three weeks? 

Not mention Tx looks like may end patients dying healthcare system overloaded. worry going get plenty death yet. smart knows moment, anything change. [x] doubt Thank bringing scientific method thread. patience anymore. Good luck. Anyone link open letter WHO?

Also anyone links scientific papers airborne?

I don’t trust media would rather go k sources.

Thank advance Science utterly compromised days. ""publish perish"" ""publish positive perish"". wonder consumer lost confidence. mean someone say needed slow testing Serving ice cream what's getting harrassed abusive morons. So, yes. That's 'firing line'. 
There's need employ children. agree. It’s ridiculous. Nah, you’re good. We’ll make through. descended fearful people gave easily. Don’t roll over. point often overlooked, applies cities, rural communities -- us. islands. fuel keep moving spite COVID. noticed.. happened alot recently help clear up, thank you. worth, think lot people misread/misinterpreted originally said. know did. agree there's major, massive issues testing done Africa poor, disconnected populations. 

Thank helping clarify more. case, health care workers psychiatrists, dentists, massage therapists... whole slew people going care sick. actual percentage *needed* health care workers far higher. Anyone link open letter WHO?

Also anyone links scientific papers airborne?

I don’t trust media would rather go k sources.

Thank advance coworkers believe virus hoax, well principal anyways I've said worked flagship hospital 7 years, instead actual healthcare operations: people deserve much credit respect everyday. kind nurse resident physicians doctors; takes special kind person every day craziness comes along it. know could never it. makes sense. us large place. think TX next region begin deciding gets live? I’ve moved playing “Is spring allergies COVID?” “Is much time air conditioning COVID?” Make everyone wear mask.

Taiwan Hong Kong lockdown sense. People can't even socially distance countries. AC everywhere.

The mask answer. I'm sorry feel way good meltblown polypropylene mask

Just like masks we're using...oh, wait. Never mind. extent, Florida started peaking 2 weeks ago yet fatalities flat. dont use HVAC. use windows doors yard. 
You dont need symptomatic spread Covid. understand infected second time. would plateau look like scenario. comment shit.

Every week see new thread spreading different misinformation like “COVID airborne” “COVID can’t spread asymptomatic”

We’ve know airborne spread asymptomatically 6 months, people need start calling shit out. never said one group wearing masks. Plenty people sides fucking up. love NorCal see too. However, one side government, including President, relentlessly pushing anti-mask misinformation propaganda. right waging anti-expert/anti-education war long time. know what? Recent events show without shadow doubt, voting good guys. U.S. schools start back August places.

Places like Florida Texas, seeing worst days now.


The adults whining like children masks now, really upset kids get start school time. stayed Holiday Inn last night. skeptical ""children less likely get virus adults"" claim. best prevalence data Spain's antibody study, revealed school age children infection rates quite close adult levels, 3.0% 5-9 year olds, 3.9% 10-14 year olds, comparable 3.8% - 4.6% 30 year olds. See age distribution table band teacher, terrifies me. wind instruments, gigantic class sizes. largest 70, shoulder shoulder seated. hard find?

Learn read.. *still* planning opening Disney? (I can't see can, great 'optic'.) isn’t true though unless literally talking since late March would pretty dishonest. course. massive protests places still going much larger factor. people protesting masks going wear anyway. protests add another variable. Masks help shoulder shoulder day weeks. nothing stop Here's Duh. plexiglass doe...lol. Wear N95 grade can. wife asking last night, 'When say pandemic over, long take feel completely comfortable going anywhere anything?' pointing absolute lackluster performance Fed gov. sheer distrust goes along it. 

So pose question here. Chime in..... Well, NFL, NBA, MLB college football teams plenty tests. trust Sweden now? whole thing exhausting terms trying figure whose basic numbers reliable.  Experts what? Common sense? Absolutely, tons travelling pleasure bubble opening. Causing huge traffic jams holding truckers. understand people wanting see families, people thought would good idea day 1?

Hell, Americans coming Canada premise travelling Alaska spending week cities. 

I really feel people dealing caring others COPD otherwise immunocompromised. don’t see virus going away anytime soon. first thought post mentioned elevators. Small space interact contact point anyone else used it. live condominium apartment building. first order business get door go wash hands immediately, reach destination leave too, since way knowing touched surfaces 100% need interact move about. 100% truthful? People lie time, especially truth makes look bad. follow correct way remove gloves mask? 'uh...yeah!' thinking 'ooooh....shoot.' heads.

Doesn't even lie. Simple contact took granted never thought touched face again. phone. wallet/purse.

[And helpful nurse span four minutes quickly get contaminated.

An apartment building elevator terrible example could airborne, user mentioned needs explain they're actually referring people stop assuming they're talking about. everyone dog assuming stuff virus since day one, every level, acting like ""shhhyeah, totally knew stuff certain."" much misinformation, assumptions, jumping conclusions going every way idea fuck believe anymore.

Fun bonus video: [This nurse shows fast, despite gloves mask, bacteria reach mouth nose bet people never think transition removing gloves removing mask. It’s apparent many didn’t. yeah barely
Been since March. tool dumb

And therein lies rub big party neighborhood mask site! Yeah, definitely see becoming thing now. would agree possibility exponential growth. Spoiler alert, deaths lag Wow, stupid depends are. Michigan pumping 15000 tests day low numbers April. dropped 14000 tests day coming June numbers soaring. also, areas usually well ventilated, could whole cloud nasty particles waiting stairwell. Everyone wears mask still many businesses require signs requiring them. Compared posts comments see regarding states appears opposite vast majority wearing masks looking upon don't. Sanitizer also available everywhere guidelines clearly communicated governor. WOuld SocIAlisM! news failure organization. bayonet. Masks effective airborne aerosols.

“Considering infected subjects (i.e., source), expiration range SARS-CoV-2 aerosols effectively attenuated mask. Thus, homemade cloth masks promoted use pandemic, particularly countries currently experiencing so-called ‘mask Politicization crisis America made far worse been. Many countries much better America. India China 3 times population better hold America. Worst hit countries Europe already opening up. Hope pull crisis stronger less divided point make statement indicating surgical face masks completely useless preventing transmission? 

I belief form prevention, including paper masks, marked improvement utilizing nothing said much. “AND ANOTHER ONE” -Dj Khaled x Cases double every week roughly, though testing capacity Florida high enough reflect anymore (you need 5% positive tests that, Florida somewhere 15-20% positive tests now). 
So I'd expect real numbers least 15-20k per day now, Florida catch them.

People get hospitalized infected week ago. hospitals ran 10k infected.

People Covid stay hospitals least two weeks, peak hospital use around 1 week peak new recorded cases.

Or words:
1 week peak infections peak new cases
1/2 week peak new cases peak hospitalizations
1 week peak hospitalizations peak hospital usage.

So Florida shut today, it'd still 2 1/2 weeks peak hospital usage. Florida shut yet, hospitals fill least end month. sure hope you’re wrong. feel bad people actually continued take preventative measures everyone mocking them. big deal Florida, lots people refused wear masks continue social distancing. contracted covid19 despite efforts follow safety protocols victims. sympathy anyone whatsoever chose endanger peoples lives participating wearing masks distancing - personally point consider passing natural selection human race better without they've done others. Texas too. Also, showed kids make bubble fort house. (Bed sheet fan) loved it. sadly agree. Yo Singapore Killin lah! (or actually killing it). looked up. is, called Plague vaccine apparently? targets Yersnia Pestis bubonic plague. google anything go by. Also bubonic plague easily treatable 10% mortality rate human treated. untreated 90%. guess know much now- slowly gained testing capacity, first setting labs hospitals private labs. lab capacity sufficient, regions tasked getting actual testing capacity broadening testing criteria. 

This latter step meant building staffing test facilities, well getting infrastructure place track, record notify test results. 

Different regions varying success getting ready, did, number tests generally increased greatly. 

So, sudden increase tests wasn’t change criteria instead, increased capacity caused change criteria.

First Covid, people talking new H1N1 flu strain, Plague.... want know bad get. massive range, awesome. Stupid copyright laws prevent u.s. seeing that! Yep. even *have* in-person school kids can't even socialize? Yeah, number deaths always increasing. That's case almost everywhere. 

No, I'm talking daily number deaths. number deaths single day increasing day passed. Sweden do.

For example, April 16, reported 10 deaths occurred day. next day, total April 16 38, day 59, 61, 63, 78, 96, 99, 107... May 29 reported extra death April 16, bringing total 111, current total April Anders Tegnell says figures stable somewhat level previous week, number deaths averaging around 70 day. 

 

The actual average week 94 deaths per day, fact deadliest week far.

But that's Tegnell telling people. Cases definitely increase considering nationwide protests three weeks. Unlikely get death surge that. thought opening strip club good idea?  f'ings looking for. You’re missing point—there’s difference kids look like vs many kids older ones look younger ones. don’t live society many kids ensure least get adulthood. three triplets - Rona, Covid little Wuhan - healthy! Sweden country usually uses air condition could play role too. three months pulling teeth trying get adhere masks quarantining. I’ve adopted philosophy “if die, die” positive side similar bar opening Italy things go badly. 

bars 3x since ever met someone Sweden? pretty much never go work sick anyway, love order general don’t get close strangers. also still way cases compared neighboring countries. Sweden wasn’t beautiful herd immunity experiment. 
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
Also, US would never ever remotely like Sweden. We’re far bombastic individualistic. battle many casualties. dumbass cousin shared quote fb basically saying I'm gonna wear mask worried health. Fucking idiot. people want wear mask get like ""oh wish would've worn mask"" Lol, tests tell now. And, like said, hospitals get incentives claim covid. It’s best interest say someone care covid. I’m literally saying, “hey, doctor says wasn’t covid, maybe something killed him? That’s possible.” people get mad. hysteria lmao. at? base anything cases question process. Period.

When 2255 deaths per day many cases have, answer fraction show today.

So many people truly infected then? don’t know. could base anything current amount cases? half daily cases 4x daily deaths 🤔

Perhaps much consider daily positive tests. (There is)

Lastly, I’m mitigating virus, I’m also unrealistic idealist. I’m numbers person. 130k+ deaths hasn’t gotten attention general idea expect total impact virus be. 3rd inning 9 inning game, without vaccine improved therapeutics way potentially 540k deaths even tho number continues revised downward predicted IFR gone something like 2-3% low .25%.

Agreed. won’t one child exposed. classmates teachers. quarantine people 14 days? happens aren’t enough teachers building? close anyway we’ve made people sick we’re stubborn stay home first place. Maybe Better Business Bureau (BBB) country from? easy get tested America. Anyone thinks protests aren’t spreading virus fu**ing moron. Even worse people traveling Florida vacation bringing back them. stop red lights. tyranny needs end right dammit!! Anyone reference pack disposable masks Amazon 30 cents each? others interested, found these, ned Tuesday (I Prime) Huge general strikes would helpful. clearly need BIG revolution things function. Meanwhile USA, weather channel’s app built COVID graphs national map divided county MLS. sign cringe. I’m pretty sure Thomas Jefferson would kicking ignorant jokers’ asses — Enlightenment thought flaws sure anti-science stupidity wasn’t among them.  I'm sure difference exception intentional loophole. Wow thank you. need showing. Great every single post sub need prefaced Trump sucks avoid downvotes.  It’s honestly shameful already.  High Canada, come over? I'll bring drinks. ""Lehman's brothers' collapse threat economy. People's reaction is."" Yes, missing hockey! difference opening mall shopping mall? I’m confused. rich buy properties rent rest us. lose lose situation. maybe cuz people SF work home something unlike LA... Hi! get data from? Texas Arizona suggested lockdown lol want doctors, nurses, admins working free? water wet.

*raises hand*

""Acktually---"" think 100% face backlash, think phase 4 places really need vaccine. studied years there’s pandemic originating city lab is. That’s pretty big coincidence swallow. wtf we, stupid supposed believe? That's good, still think different methods (and still be) evaluated bar exams every exam.

The risk (new cluster, new infections, new potential deaths) great that. could lawyers practicing two years occasional supervision senior lawyer, would vouch him/her completely habilitated.

Or habilitate de plano, let market set right: good lawyer, fear competition.

Of course options dictated emergency, would lifted soon emergency ends. 

Or maybe would reasons go way, I'm currently even taking account.

But think least public consideration this, yet seen none whatsoever. January maybe would point. Today though, US done spread Covid China Europe put together. Dunno downvoted. got around $800 back school last semester. office, occasionally work guy. yes, hired deep cleaning service opened next day. office closed wfh since late March. 

Just bad guy called doctor, doctor said thinks covid based timing symptoms told get tested. Guy walks said office anyway. 🤦 People required wear masks, proudly proclaim won't. Worse go hospital sick die, take resources, time, effort away actual sick people already overcrowded, risk spreading virus them.

People see ""well affect me"" perspective, without realizing every person goes hospital, matter small issue is, taking doctor's time someone else. *Nipah entered chat* believe vaccine exist end year also expect team completely fail getting us. HAHAAAAA... no. average cost basic things (such child birth) around 30-75,000 dollars. Rest assured, anyone charged penny more, pre-existing medical condition, americans whos entire healthcare system rests fact wager people get sick die, help pay us getting sick dying. Unless costs much, insurance insurance steps noone pays shit. got guns, tho. Hospitalization rates 1.7% 50 symptomatic (According CDC). also say overall 35% infections asymptomatic. that's 1.2%.

What's around 20% hospitalizations turn ICU patients, 70% get ventilators. 50 got thing like 0.17% chance ending tube throat. 

This data prior April 29, likely improved since then. sounds like you’re one who’s triggered here. What??? I’m world talking about. 

I live NC would often visit many “Tourist beaches”. Granted aren’t high rise hotels lining beach people driving Charlotte, Raleigh, Durham, Winston-Salem, Greensboro, Chapel Hill one hundreds medium sized cities state. certainly don’t stay houses large kitchens. stay dumpy little hotels find Surf City Wilmington. Honestly, places folks giving shit anyways like yours, I'd support inoculating every child parents care COVID area gets herd immunity faster. That's they're lying pieces shit. whole line ""research"" debunked. data fake, Lancet NEJM lost serious credibility this. automatically believe mother fucking thing either anymore. responsible destruction entire world's economy lies. 'm NYS virtually for-profit hospitals around here.

The local hospital network area non-profit. top people make ton money LOT money reserve. fact much two years ago bought another hospital money had. We'll never know many cases PRC actually has, know concealed tried cover up. PRC does. Many schools state don’t air conditioning. super hot classrooms September June, normally 10 degrees hotter classroom outside stuffy.  minimal airflow even windows open. can’t see masks going smoothly hot classrooms. probably go covid, Corona much prettier name. many daily records Florida Texas need have, figure MAYBE listened experts like Fauci instead denying science? Unlike Climate Change takes long time negative outcomes manifest, COVID spreads fast sick people show ERs fast. Doctors already approaching triage stage soon people could saved die, die unnecessarily states re-opened flattening curve.

Seriously like can't teach old politician new science. too, friend. wish family best. happening county businesses well. rural king nearby employees allowed say tested positive virus. afraid losing jobs. messed up. Thankfully family never shopped much anyway. http://imgur.com/gallery/5V9z00g It’s ridiculous walking street seeing people bars already like 2 PM

Do really need drink fucking bad? drink home lot like rabies. around least since ancient egypt, still close 100% fatal. know much think do. *surprised Pikachu* Yeah common lot people think. Plague still around. know people raise triplets, one newborn hard enough. maybe asked someone explain like im 35. couple years??? That’s already happening.. fucking parallel society completely different believe system reality  That's good news, heard anything similar live hopefully we're something similar It’s insanity. People thinking could reopen aftermath would tolerable stoned dumb. vaccine administered sufficiently large portion population country slow open fast close game going played. Oooo another expert. someone die mean sitting hospital 5 weeks hardly able breath ""totally harmless"" analysis published anywhere fun (so absolutely 0 credibility ignore better sources all), looked like took roughly 6 weeks weeks start decreasing lockdown average pretty variable lockdown measures differ lot state state/country country. lack test capacity certainly intentional, get from? good know I'm one work ""One"" boss absolute incompetent idiot. yelling service worker give said worker freebie punching face controlling protests,

not enforcing social distancing

not requiring masks

not contact tracing ust like initial denial COVID China's political interests WHO's financial interests

This straight lie. never denied COVID risk. also financial advantage denying risk. Yep, potentially not. definitely would odd did. That's like asking college kids refrain sex booze.

I'm sure frat boys careful covid STDs... might originated China US making situation much worse  You’re completely ignoring testing, tracing isolating combined masks, hygiene distancing incredibly effective strategies. don’t blindly accept half million deaths willing do. expect nationwide protests? think spelled wrong...but yes, is. city reported almost double number day before. countries 'mask'? I'm Canada. Less half people see wear them. plenty reports people Denmark I've seen saying use 'em...

Then there's places like Japan even lockdown. Yes always sorta wear masks certainly everyone certainly law.

The reason cases deaths going bad way count now. count every death person covid necessarily result covid. Furthermore count 'probable' cases case count see TV.

This means 10,15,20 cases one actual positive result. Anyone contact trace result becomes 'probable' counted towards total case count.

The article says Iranian public, like Trump, Florida Texas, get it. here. Almost nobody wearing mask, packed together, shouting due loud music liquor.

I think could create better set conditions cause airborne virus spread tried. takes months training turn medical/surgical nurses ICU nurses, I've nursing 10 years almost none specialized skills required even provide assistance ICU. pandemic declared March. hospitals started train nurses ICU instead furloughing save money, would ready go now. flaired good news.

The first part sweet justice, second part unfortunate. Totally true. rest world choice close borders Americans. HIPPA laws prevent employers giving details employees’ health data. may seem contradict good sense pandemic, thankful laws exist employers can’t divulge health information us. clandestine operation. parents.

Her body creating reserves. 

We truly live Idiocracy point Covid isn’t helping. us taking seriously said, aren’t baby there’s vaccine. Meanwhile, conspiracy nuts spent lockdown maternity leave. Seeing people U.K. act stupidly us Americans make feel little better. reason, totally alone stupidity. start early ages, like daycare age (3-5yrs old) Children age love sweep floors. ;) Someone whose business supplying lonely men tits look at? ...mocks supposedly deny science...by ignoring data: bet kind person goes swimming lake 60 miles another human, yet still wear mask water. school, faculty staff old. live right border two states, teachers/staff retire one state, work years. workers walkers. unsual get sick weeks hospital transfer nursing home/rehab recover going back work. Thanks! That's speculation, still scientific evidence protests led covid spikes. states like MN, tests protesters lower positive rate overall rate entire state itself.

We know covid risk much worse indoors outdoors 👀👀 search coronavirus youtube get bunch results vaccines like it. really pushing vaccine hard. Wow, someone reaaaaaaally wants us inject us odd chemicals. [I’m sure accurate site is, mostly right trend .... interesting Yup. Even suburbs people even make effort distance passing despite tons space. Neighbors big party without masks. idiots take seriously family friends dead. say Canadians unhappy it, Canadian healthcare system slow? Take deep breath, re-read said. embarrassing yourself. might back April, goodwill towards teachers tends short lived. May God mercy soul Except protests werent indoors moat people wore masks.. 

The protests vs people wearing masks ridiculous..

If people protested governments abandon succeded regulating sustainable environment hell would also bear fruit since would need protests However, can’t pay back, hospital cover costs period time

:/ know part.. pretty aggressive. laughed hard aside minor details that's exactly is. 10/10 can't tell troll mentally impaired... Sound right, started slow hospital 200 patients 500 beds. 

Every evening 2:30-11pm would sit around waiting orders something do. LMAO. dude straight telling people mental illnesses head there’s secret downvote squad multiple alts looking downvote every comment makes. Straight schizophrenic ramblings Self employed here. 
I’ve geared type thing quite awhile. Isolation doesn’t bother me.

Set tablet shoot shit people. 

I haven’t laid months. sucks. 

I set old PS3 guest room finally played Last Us. Things could whole lot worse. Bot, deadass killing vibe rn. I’m ignoring it, aren’t discussing it.

So apologize, don’t personally ability make people act best interests. please let know figure one out. I’ll adjust models account it. enforce mask rule open entire country up? may worked one day week, normal district TN. worked 7 days week shutdown, many colleagues well. 

All teachers deemed essential US babysitting. Europe, Canada, Australia New Zealand say otherwise. problem blood test tell antibodies family COVID. includes common cold. 

So blood tests positive could COVID, could month ago recovered common cold. 

If swab test positive currently infected. depends viral load time test. top doctor government lies wearing masks? sure that? One side openly come white supremacists 2020. vehemently oppose science fueled incivility cruelty. Protests good indicator American people fighting against. shit, different country. Look recent Rushmore rally rally goers said Sioux protesters. Two weeks sounds optimistic. I'm sure told people research calling sheeple. see people sub commenting frequently “long term chronic effects” result COVID. lines evidence ongoing studies looking this? feels like pivot - posters trying rationalize think it’s impossible completely recover instead focusing fact people died continue die it. far I’ve read, SARS patients showed chronic issues, dissipated time - SARS also much severe disease progression higher fatality rate. People still avoiding COVID risk chronic problems, doom gloom see nearly every comment thread (for example, [saying it’s better die get COVID live terrible seems unwarranted. 

Thoughts this? cares? mean honestly, cares idiots. 2-8% filtration droplets aerosols? news purely made translation error. Brilliant job.  But. heat shock proteins. 
🙄 feel bad. one ever thinks teachers.

(Seriously, feel bad. There's difference knowing caring. going know) Intubated, incubated. Spell check like first one though, might auto-correct. Phase 2 expands capacity additional 373 ICU beds, well staff equipment. 

 Clearwater Beach one visited beach America.

No not. bear mind roughly 300-500 deaths per day virus right would make third leading killer united states year. peak biggest killer us, lower definitely better.

it's also worth noting deaths lag several weeks (you see peak case count NY peak versus peak death count (3-4 weeks apart) peak actually peaks, roughly 3-4 weeks later see whatever peak death count be. that's chickens counted, before. Regardless long takes set new melt blown material machine, Trump still invoked defense production act increase production PPE. Im sorry robbing stores, destroying private public property protest

Will someone please think inanimate objects destroyed? That's real tragedy. current rise cases really nothing protests everything lifted restrictions. fact, protests may actually caused net reduction spread virus, since cities large protests, people protesting far less likely go out.  NYC hit first argument slight herd immunity enjoy paying half income fund people’s failures. Americans would agree, ready get back work virus chance killing us. risk quarantine themselves. Deaths lagging indicator.  Give weeks declaring victory support staff school work already talking leaving. lot started working convenient (as kids enrolled there), kids since moved on. wages low, pocket money them. goes many substitute teachers.

This fall going shitshow. Lol go check Florida, New Orleans (which regularly 100% humidity hot shit) Congo, South east Asia area like it. We've hit 110 + 90%+ humidity shop plenty times, currently 93f 88% humidity, really sucks ass. think Newsom done decent job. Christ people fucking mind CDC backs anecdotal evidence data: That's real question. honestly think deaths remain relatively flat. Healthier people getting infected plus better knowledge vírus treat it. Sure get that, people around afraid ? literally 100 active cases large state. someone whose getting hammered home. title lie. sure like this. people may wear masks sign afford to. wearing masks could become something status symbol. don’t know what’s sadder, literally watching 10’s thousands people die countries last months, screaming you’ll next don’t sort out. 

Or need /s indicate sarcasm. kids didn’t learn anything almost three months online school. wife extremely involved, sitting classes helping homework, still fucking joke. aren’t dumb either; took deep dives subjects interested watched hours hours educational YouTube videos, neither wife qualified teach math weren’t interested Khan Academy pr online resources. can’t imagine they’re ones, either. 

At point fallout millions kids missing months months instruction going outweigh potential hazards virus? never denied reported cases true number people infected.

On April 18, Tegnell Anders Tegnell says **the figures stable somewhat level previous week**, number deaths averaging around 70 day. 

 

He say figures highly misleading counting. instead talked ""plateau"" exist. week turned deadliest make graph ICU admittance? 

Because, like testing, ICU admittance criteria used prioritise cases actual number people needing ICU care. proven fact many people denied ICU care thus ICU numbers give sort accurate picture number cases.

The best way get rough idea true number cases calculate based number deaths IFR. Late may, government released report antibody testing showed 6% population COVID-19 antibodies. worked IFR 0.83%, well within range calculated studies likely IFR COVID-19 (0.5-1.0%).

If take number deaths day calculate total number cases 18 days earlier (the average time infection death) based IFR 0.83%, end May get estimated 628,000 cases end May, lines almost perfectly antibody testing.

On May 31, government reporting total 39,115 cases, true number closer 630,000 cases.

On April 18, total number cases reported 14,276, true number closer 400,000. Joe riding coattails now. 
Here come Bill Burr Andrew Schultz take Yeah, backtracking. posted Fauci said better ways contract trace working, especially black brown people talk government. told fuck off.

Here's said it:  Government officials: “WE REOPEN! literally 2% population owns business majority corporate equities making less money usual!”

Medical guys: “Probably great idea.”

Government officials: “AND LANDLORDS! WON’T SOMEBODY THINK LANDLORDS?!”

No good leftists like me: “Why can’t richest country world go like three months without exploitation labor parasitism without wheels falling off? all, know even government, money supplies kind emergency. It’s like every excess penny scraped given someone. why?” Oh shit...you’re 100% right completely forgot that. That’s August usually isn’t it? might nothing left Florida point lol Yeah, wide open province yet we're 1/3 amount back March/April. provinces never saw significant community spread. Going pretense false fact 99% people get sick main reason people getting sick cases spiking. person lucky enough get doesn’t mean another won’t one person won’t symptoms doesn’t mean people infect won’t any. give chance? It’s hard sit back, don’t get it. There’s excuse. bad mean happened. hit total caseload swine flu yet. AIDS? SARS Toronto terrifying 2003. Anyone going medical profession expecting career without epidemic probably going profession eyes wide open. research discover disease outbreaks rule, exception. think otherwise hubris. pandemic. I’m saying deserves

Hours worked location dependent. Remember makes pretty much cut half expenses. Cool story Except wrong... Many/most people protests wearing masks standing much ""shoulder shoulder"". Canada always hiding truth. Go ahead downvote u spineless biyaaaaaatches nation rich, but..

We people, nation. simply work now, always have.

Its acceptable people, cogs. cogs ment tossed lose teeth.

And we're proud it. Yay, got new place! Hope visit newest home, I'm intubated /s ...and that’s enough Internet today

Thank can't really sue someone dying virus. That's risk assume anytime go outside.  think hit nail head.  expect universities. New Tik Tok challenge: #CoughOnTeacher

“I able get 20 coughs ran room!!! Score!” Bars restaurants big ones since can't wear mask short list reopening. Movie theatres also worry theatre makes money food, gives incentive lenient mask policy.

Gyms could list too, except they're much smaller part economy generally accepted stay closed.

But still legitimate worry second wave could hit worse first. Murphy politically testing delay go back reopening important proper response second wave shut everything again. issue right figuring line is. CDC disagrees BS anecdotal evidence: Give month. Second major outbreak? Uhhh call this? 

What call outbreak march? time locked aut0cratic regime need prosper? Ignorant fucks. could possibly exploit weaknesses? They're right watching. systemic weaknesses easy exploit regime rise. talking general, NK country generally students school cleaning. SK, China Japan well. lungs tend good healing (unless idiopathic fibrosis Coronavirus cause). Long term smokers lungs much better shape nine months quit. early say never get lung capacity back We’ve actually increased precautions cases go down. It’s mandatory wear masks inside buildings lot areas now. wasn’t mandatory month ago Ah sorry. That's last I've heard this. everyone house covid except me, bedroom bathroom, even way avoid catching accept I'll become infected $5 per day.

Slave labor. That’s really interesting. decide gets it? Exactly. Still don’t know long terms effects thing.. Romulans without honor! What's source that? really. Maybe snakes. Gators like saltwater, stick rivers lakes they're used to. dude go look data, article links articles one links 404'ed.

Also June 29th. Tests going vary number reported daily. Yesterday highest number reported tests yet. look actual data says this. feel like they’re smart probably won’t let us... I’m lifeguard. almost wanted report boss shift facility working way legal capacity Covid. since open MD DC, amount cars saw near parks close beltway insane. several police officers writing tickets since parking lots full people parked side road. wish started phase 3 4th, would much better lowered number state people coming in. hospitals next empty. Students going comply guidelines... first thing everyone school closed lockdown party...

It's everyone's best interest least make remote option students learn... Especially professors. MLB makes tests using labs PED testing. he'll safe :-) are. went Mid Valley last Friday. say literally everyone wore masks time Thank much taking time answer me. helpful. think I’m close couldn’t clearly see options. I’ll talk driving. mom loves see backroads anyway, maybe could make trip see sights, speak. Thanks again, kind redditor. I’ve seen reporting this. link? open schools vaccine developed.  necessarily so. vulnerable healthcare workers environmental services staff hospital. go every room clean regular. make ""shit ton"" money. Neither, matter, medical assisants. Even physicians tertiary quaternary health centers, usually academic hospitals associated universities, make shit tons. They're working academic hospitals knowingly choose make less want academic environment. That's obviously choice, pulling millions dollars year.

Teachers get paid though.

Ah geez, whoops, sorry bout that. ok, grandma needed die economy anyways El Dorado County, county 200,000 people, 3 people hospital, one ICU.

So like much debate like truth rhetoric people using becomes one hills willing die on. given AZ exponential growth mode sounds like mesaures buy week two. *shocked Pikachu face* here. county minimally affected virus. People think rural problem. think we're ""safe"" it. hardly anybody wears masks around people. county local officials allowed big all-day town-wide July 4th celebration take place county's biggest town. drew people county, fair amount people neighboring suburban counties canceled plans due control positive test rates. I'm sure serious consequences it. hospitals surrounding suburban counties filling fast. I'm worried we're going start seeing increase deaths people get sick medical care limited. I’m real life right now? That’s absolutely whats happening. hospital already discussing reusing iso gowns floor already stolen secret stash that’ll last day. Pandemic aside would ANYONE, EVER want there? water probably filthy, sand filthy. many goddamn people. Ew. lot people confuse viral load initial exposure dosage. Viral load much virus time test taken (in cases, swab) measured easily. initial exposure dose amount virus got sick, unknown can't deliberately expose humans. larger initial exposure dose likely result infection, necessarily serious infection. say, someone get exposed large dose likely get sick, necessarily get sicker someone got sick smaller exposure dose, second person may shittier immune system. 

A larger initial exposure dose likely result infection, virus particle certain probability entering cell. pass AC safer coughed face, like someone peeing river vs someone peeing hot tub, neither great, one definitely worse other. gets worse people care workers. fact serve them. can't today 🤦 redditor saying shit came China.

So SC 21% rate missing milder cases not? actual infection rate number considered 'high'? increase testing get number down? fact testing enough number would lower... lets get test 5% conclusion draw testing 5%? 

JHU also goes lower positivity may indicate community including testing patients milder symptoms.""

So 1% rate 21% rate would testing instead under-testing, yes? actual infection rate 1% JHU think low 21% high? 1% would commenting Reddit great SC fighting covid? guys probably would still understand data.

So bullshit number bullshit metric show cannot show actual infection rates. nothing JHU say ""this evidence of"", instead ""can provide insights"" ""suggests that"" ""possibly"" ""may indicate"". words statistician legalize ""this proof anything"". think smarter South Florida, plus tri-counties largest state. better.

Thats one protest would endorse...ofc outdoors distancing social media hash tags/boycotting/union strikes America best. COVID hurts poor countries America #1, nothing worry loooool - look naïve snowflake thinks getting paid pittance makes slave labor Exactly this: normal people looking hope latch even dubious data. sister law posted article morning Facebook: 

It claims Grand Rapids Michigan dying COVID .06% rate.  gets projecting 220k people county (the county dashboard lists less 5k). 

I pointed discrepancy, make bad guy denying hope. Nobody knows Florida doing... including Florida. *Cries American* Agree, take 10 days hospitals feel relief action taken today. I’m afraid sad days ahead. Yep, hope whole mess gets people see light reproducing-we're SUPER collectively overconsumptive, &amp; people born would help reduce tht. Yeah common sense sure. Relying one company putting eggs one basket multiple resources available exactly need case one falters. 

We're getting close...... city Nowhere U.S. opened vaccine. PERIOD. That’s.... temporary disruptions Spain. lot people went financially. 

A lot people poorer countries hit financially hard. Truthfully, looks like Arizona *only* state lot capacity yield...but would need digging see there's something artificially limiting AMT beds available. case early wing major urban hospital ATL, believe problem since fixed. Funny correlation places biggest protests Covid19 spikes. Seattle New York instance relatively safe. Places reopened quickly however not. It’s Abbott; Harris County constables HPD refused enforce orders last time. Business law enforcement lost confidence Judge SAH order poorly conceived lacked plans standards reopening.

If hope compliance second order, authorities *must* explain time different. country truly class itself. Enjoy! TI?  millennia feel confident Oxford vaccine modified one already passed safety trials see, they’ll precautious everything fine! What’s sick kids? It’s free daycare! That’s worth risk! /s need figure function battling virus.

Sure, accept hospitals, people dying streets, general collapse business activity many people sick ""functioning"" sure, society go on. Oh yeah, hear saying. That's doable makes someone nauseous. I'm horny next guy F that. dont know people dare meetup sex time. Honestly absolutely asinine America made politics important human life. possibly rationalize politicization mask wearing??

Buy way, effective next week, Greater Toronto Area mandated mask wearing without one little demonstration. fact came basically resounding SIGH relief.

RESPECT SCIENCE! GO BACK WORK NEW NORM VACCINE eradicates VIRUS. That's point, understand people continue claim deaths tracked released. may fully accurate data. aggressive? Lmao

Electricity weird! People distancing people, that's point. That's bad. People Florida going business like nothing wrong, % people wearing masks consistently effectively depressingly low. hospitals already 100% ICU capacity, *never* happened NY, arguably already worse there.

Infections aren’t pandemic. Fatalities are. Hundreds thousands getting infected every day around world, great news builds societal immunity hopefully without suffering outside US people wearing masks getting mild viral loads. Thanks chat. think it's, like, impossible Russian propaganda site get ua domain I've got bridge sell you.

One even said, 'watch covid nonsense magically disappear come November elections over.' Really Dorothy? guess whole world conspiring together tank economies, allow large portion country get sick another portion die USA elections... gall people. That's remember. That's United States America ya. question people protest violently sometimes. Get freezer trucks ready sad...and true Household infection rates 10%-30%, lower people spouses, take look Table 3 Try room them, keep window open possible fresh air dilute viral particles, spend time outdoors possible, odds good. tested positive, peak infectiousness windows probably passed already - peak infectiousness day symptom onset day that, decline course 11 days. ones alarmed would dipshits reddit. (Everyone else either already alarmed susceptible alarm.) Yup. 

They won’t protest getting busted facing charges though. 

It takes asshole break herd-protecting law. protesting it, takes special kind stupid! I'm physician academic hospital, making shit tons money.

Compared doctors countries, definitely making ""shit tons money,"" agree awful doctors make ""shit tons money"" people cleaning toilets hospitals sanitizing hospital rooms can't even afford access health care hospitals work. Canada normal country tackled problem normal predictable way.  


The problem USA problem big limits politicized. Americans millions risking death ignore facts daily basis prove point political rivals. ""Hurr worry guys people INACTIVE virus still system months later. getting sick inactive? dunno cells through!""


Fucking trogs. Rapid pace reopening NY? Lol shut 100days even touched phase 1. start phased reopenings. 2 weeks per phase, 4 phases. area still phase 4 restrictions. Gyms, schools, malls, places worship, movie theaters gotten green light even consider partial reopenings. exception mall stores exits go directly outside mall interior areas. asked death number wasted time post comment didn’t even include number anywhere it.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* It’s %. It’s absolute numbers. NYC hospitals overwhelmed. made hospital convention center. Florida hospitals overwhelmed. Texas hospitals overwhelmed. Arizona hospitals overwhelmed. more. cases still rising. hope people stop trying use death counts downplay situation find in. Dear USA hell?!!! Sincerely rest world. Yes  still PPE shortage 6 months pandemic? V Vendetta life imitating art shining through... Europe looking UK horror. That's borders remain closed. else gonna do? Materials available. 15 500? hospital NYC months ago. feel people. virus doesn’t give shit heat. Maybe articles reading ones I've read I've seen blame china BLM protesters got it. always ""don't like think get it"" ""I wish wore mask"" everyone blames china BLM protesters know right? Even headline doubt mean US epidemic literal sense... really like analogy all. we've seen court decision court decision sex sexuality protected class. turning away customer they're gay violation constitution.

Mask wearing protected private property owners allowed refuse service. saw long twitter read someone COVID. Young, healthy. claim still fever four months later developed psychosis, brain fog, bunch scary shit. awful feeling least part bullshit? get long term effects happen, fever four months don’t really buy. makes fucking sense. Kingman almost 5 hour drive Tucson. probably good sized hospital Arizona farther away Tucson Kingman. Sure, believe that. also believe way many people complete denial many comorbidities actually people actually walking around without any.  Local state gov. killing citizens imposing another mandatory lockdown. need lockdown vaccine distributed. calling bad behavior hopes you’d change future. Add existing covid-19 problem special air quality hazard resulting fireworks epidemic.  Wtf grew Florida never heard this. actually real? wonder else personally cared. environment, mask? . wondering. Ugggghhhhh, feel that. school closed March, dealing several new transfer students schools dumped onto campus “behavior problem school” district. Meaning already huge class sizes bigger, dealing additional 3-5 students per class made personal mission cause much disruption possible. 

The last two weeks school closure literally stopping fights every single hour. prefer term rational Maybe masks offered entrance requirement bring one charge small fee like California chose plastic bag purchase? can’t people positions balls say truth? Yes, he’s wrong. CFR hovering around 4.5% 20% infected require hospitalization. Hillsborough county rained virus surging here. rained minutes early day last long.

Jesus christ hope God never see family. 

And say work healthcare? Christ system failed us. 

I can't believe blaming patients naming symptoms have...

Like hell supposed say chest pain shortness breath? 

You realize takes 2 weeks show symptoms. 


May God mercy soul. waste time?

What point posting? Apparently Shephards Beach packed full yesterday. Georgia anyone surprised? swFlorida. It’s shitshow. Man. states quick open feeling punishment trying please Trump. FL still reporting rise deaths. Don’t forget gofundme really run out, simply convert another section IMU ICU. Feel free make point I'll make mine. 110 90% humidity? recorded world record dew point 107, I’ve seen number pictures overweight people, sure. also plenty healthy weight people. think trying simplify like dangerous, assume sort self-preservation. two people know (by association) healthy weight, active, never issues aside one fairly low dose blood pressure meds. other, also healthy weight, active. Idk issues, diabetic, always healthy weight. It’s easy point say fat people old people, that’s big part problem now. Yeah, fighting someone Twitter claims two degrees proudly proclaims don’t matter. goes discourage people going school lists dropouts got rich famous. really regret engaging mofo. got totally incensed line reasoning - rather lack thereof. Admittedly public education needs improved, encouraging masses reject education altogether downright evil. put tin foil head protect 5G signals. get roll Dollar Tree $1! Cheaper masks! /s yes, schools lots sick kids -- sometimes even guns -- teachers deserve get paid and, yet, unlike doctors pandemic, whine every single time get put overflowing classroom 40 kids. State border regulations runs fairly tricky constitutional issues. like shed virus story conservative denier getting sick could Bore us with, Johnson end goal exact thing scientists saying since March- keeping infection rate level hospitals able treat every patient. scientist recommended abandoning lockdown virus cure without aggressive testing contact tracing, time follow order lift lockdowns. 

As paying- enough money pay everyone stay home. paid 500 billion corporations reason- pay people stay home indefinitely. didn’t need experts know Yea, dougie crew trying eradicate asap especially schools reopen september fear FL going vivid medical hell least early 2021.

me too. mother lives there, said one wearing mask even county live mask order. I'm pretty sure mass grave sites trying hide make sure vaccines available October key swing states, especially suburbs.

They’ll probably nothing salt water touch Clorox, shilling wonderful vaccine I’m last ditch effort win. go place ""enforced masks"" 1/4 1/3 people wear mask nose take entering store. people putting masks screaming kids either. situation specific, often that's literally illegal healthcare/social work/emergency fields w continuation care/abandonment one relieve you. horror stories r/legaladvice past nursing security work people skipping shifts like 36 hour shift, etc. ones I""m thinking pre-covid, too. works. peaks goes away despite masks quarantines. I'm currently redington beach. decent social distancing crowds seem bad. recently visited aquarium tampa Florida everyone face masks on. 1 instance woman face mask aquarium activity. Amazing aggressive, highly contagious virus never bothered infect anyone rearing head Wuhan. Lots places seem report weekend holiday. quite trust lowest. agree, can't believe number people acting like everything going normal couple months. think still trouble perceiving scale pandemic. China ae Wuhan also thousands doctors nurses rest country help Wuhan. US concentrated. Best comment I've read today lives needlessly blanket lock downs.

More lives going destroyed half-assed, ""economy comes first, lives come second"" response crisis that's gone months. shit could beginning April implemented stringent, nationwide lockdown. still think everyone wearing masks. am. 

But blanket curfews lock downs everyone regardless age doesn’t make sense. stayed quarantine long, created emotional reaction “get back normal”, resulted people throwing caution wind.

Assuming can’t eradicated (there’s zero indication be), tried slowly open back two months ago, pushing (mandating?) masks, intention getting back normal life, prepared increase cases manageable. essence, need steady stream people getting infected long period time, without spikes overwhelm hospitals.

Or play politically charged game lock vs. reopen, clearly resulted opposite set message “flatten curve” guess summer heat didnt kill virus all... it. Private schools US often. really know public schools don't. surprising top comment. rare, happens every year. Start confiscating shady investments US... well least scam call centers slowed much it? country failed move bar closing time 2am like everyplace else Western world Brits can't hold drink act like fucking idiots let stay late. nanny state bring back default 11pm save themselves.

This utterly unsurprising. Expect spike couple weeks. Exactly, BJ cronies pretending sophisticated drinking culture.

Waaay shots shots shots waaaay kebab waaay moar shots waay fight fight fight fight waaay probably see therapist. Feeling way described almost certainly much worse getting COVID. hitches replaced bollards prevent old ladies ramming store hit wrong pedal wish principal guts that. lambs sacrifice free babysitting. Florida lying deaths.  world closing borders world. U.S. U.S. started closing borders January China March EU. people suddenly like like politicize/fetishize it. It’s really weird. haven’t cases Toronto past couple days IIRC. Lots people beach Canada Day think there’s gonna relative spike soon, far Toronto good Hospital staff literally encouraging BLM Protests weeks ago... say fuck them, job it. lockdowns Wowza! Thanks primer. probably physical anxiety. Like people get anxious small closed spaces. 


I got friend gets uncomfortable would probably freak hard elevator broke inside. anything else, calm collected. wife essentially got fired this. someone works one hospitals listed article, know virus real. said, numbers completely inaccurate. busier normal means overwhelmed beds. sure article would falsify information. Surgeon general said masks don’t work need wear one. less that? tends population concentrated US. Thanks taking look visuals. Vaccines play small role morbidity average flu. May 75th now, right? can't keep track time anymore.... reopening bars resteraunts, stores, etc impact cases opinion? would reversing reopening then? would shut things begin with?

Why states reopened aggressively ones cases spiking?

Why states still strict lockdown protests well experiencing spikes?

Protests contribute, small percentage person person interactions. Millions interacting daily going business usual.

Use critical thinking, research. well known causes virus spread points. countries effectively controlled it.

It's definitely control US. large portion population running around conspiracy theories, abandoning logic, ignore state/local mandates etc.

As long trolls like running around spreading misinformation never beat thing. everything Trump. 

This big flashing banner every page reddit. User name checks out, 2 sober. Maybe start welding people apartments like China also . yep, grand total 1 person right. many covid vrs normal icu patients? Considering increase new cases last 2 weeks (31k\~)  


It's honestly surprising. 50% total cases coming last 2 weeks. friends Arizona happy, good reason. grew Daytona. Yeah great going Vanilla Ice concerts MTV spring break '93 shit dead 20 years. Pinellas County gets almost 20 million tourists year probably least 15 million go Clearwater least once. east coast beaches get many tourists year. Pinellas Clearwater become way popular recent years people coming beach part Disney vacations.

Anyways, used live one shacks got torn years ago behind Screwie Louis's south beach. Madeira Beach residents special breed misfit loved living there. moved shitty apartments gulf-to-bay wanted kill every time drive somewhere. finally enough moved county altogether. gotten crowded expensive traffic sucks. I'm saying Clearwater Beach years need go see they've turned place into. insane. whole point flattening curve buy time ramp capacity? Well? fuck happened? Where's capacity?

I understand people stop giving shit they're constantly lied to. flattened curve. bought time. ready this. plan never stop spread. plan SLOW spread. /s = sarcasm overall, recorded illnesses alarming rate.

Check pneumonia deaths year compared every year. use singular, plural. feel sorry landlords pub workers really ask question good society. Let’s pretend it’s small minority go quiet drink two. It’s actual madness weekends police hospitals need clean aftermath weekends. Oh yeah, stay house can't keep family non-American, hard think Donald Trump rules world.

Even somehow managed stop research taking place America (and there's reason he'd actually able that), lots countries would able investigate drug.

The lack research ivermectin global failure, American one. ""Where DeSantis go get apology?!"" Understatement year! Yup. vote November simple. Life (more) death. know death cult vote for. need vote life. simple. Better non-smokable (and non-vapable) forms avoid unnecessary lung damage. Seems lot coastal locations hot. Imagine NYC shed mask rally upswing. get much worse there. warned hope get it. thinking Kardashians. Great still doesn’t mean hospitals aren’t seeing extremely sick individuals won’t continue . younger patients mainly getting doesn’t mean aren’t admitting sick young people parents sick . think running remdesivir plasma south Florida ? patients exist already using therapy exhausting system.
Reading facts doesn’t make expert. Strange things turning Chinese strategists would wished... I’m saying isolate probably caught since brother symptoms three days informed society's structural system obeying dictates system two different things. shit hope Tompa Bay right. restaurants w 50% occupancy = BAD

protest *tens thousands* = OK

so sad everything political charged straightforward least honest horrible excuse human being. readily expand capacity. heads 4 largest Houston hospitals said repeatedly zero risk running capacity. almost everybody picture either wearing mask wearing one improperly... work Mease Countryside Hospital yeah we’re feeling it. They’re move COVID patients hospital wings cause ICU isn’t large. See AZ, FL, TX greater good! informed motherfuckers doubt every day stay course because, end, chose follow scientists saying Skeeter-Jed high school. Thank Dr. Beggsy909 in-depth empirical evidence show beyond doubt protests adding numbers.

In reality though, feel confident don’t understand goddamn thing virology epidemiology beyond brought quick google search. Far intelligent folks investigating many come professional opinion protests lead increase corona cases. far moron stating absolute scientists disagree you. Sorry burst bubble. Get absentee ballot. regular beds? What's census percentage there? Yeah, heard transferred someone Kingman, like, yeah, we're fucked. means can't find single bed anywhere Tucson. ""both sides"" argument ignorant Freedom tears! death rate look like ICU beds hospitals general full overwhelmed? happens people would normally meds beds Covid-19 thing? deaths well.

How survive, reporting continuing respiratory issues Covid they'll live rest life.

I agree comment replying poorly worded, much bigger deal giving credit for. Covid death rate itself. Letting run wild would terrible thing impact everyone economy. I've got fire extinguisher underneath sink long lasting burn. believe rebuttal one. needed hear going shift tonight knowing we’re almost fully reopened :’) Remember originally flatten curve hospitals overwhelmed. true. weapon working intended then... I'm curious America trying millions people die? Canadian started outbreak around time, two Toronto hospitals ICU cases atm. There's 100 percent certainty Riker strip club. please look first picture 🤦🏿‍♂️ done likely get worse gets better. desantis really needs mask order, close lot stuff done far people succumb peer pressure (in good way). go mall, looks like 90%+ people wore masks maintained social distancing. vaccines common flus.

Things different see novel flu virus. Early New York, lawyer got sick infected neighbor drove hospital. Deaths lag reported cases

We’re getting better treatment (good news)

Some states cool reporting covid deaths pneumonia personal favorite ""We're throwing God's great breathing system door!"" Yeah Karen, are, wearing mask! (cause probably get COVID die/live long term health issues due it.) go supermarket requires mask. mostly Costco Asian Super markets. don’t see business issue there. son turning 6 two days he's little bummed able big party kindy friends neighborhood pool.

So making kid best fucking cake can, got Coronavirus piñata beat shit it.

He's great kid, knows can't ""normal"" birthday year even though he's disappointed, moping it, he's getting hyped ridiculous cake we're going let run show birthday. Whatever dinner want, move modular couch movie pit watch whatever wants, little sister run sprinkler we'll Zoom birthday meeting far flung family members sing happy birthday blows candles.

Kids resilient. I'm sad deal young age think many coping lot better might think, especially parents coming decent attitude. death rate drops 5 6 percent country 2 percent probably end at,  going shitload dead people Texas, Florida, California Arizona wife was.patient number 100, early on. maybhae helped B/c deaths lag cases usually hospitals filling up. true deaths increasing like 1st time worth mention 17% antibodies representative general population. 
I can't find info study exept articles behind paywalls. see ingress study found 13% currently infected something weird study.

Note made Jan Albert et al Karolinska. group made T-cell immunity study days ago. 
For reason ""leak"" study results via press releases selected media publishing study. living 6 years Tampa bay tell you.  
These people see category 4 hurricane refuse evacuate.  
After watched hurricane destroy Cuba Puerto Rico, get faster bigger,  
these meth fueled jeeniouses still refuse evacuate.   
  
They hopeless people. never said that. advice I’ve seen since February said idea climate would impact since hasn’t seasons - unlikely affected summer/winter temperatures. ""I also expect much worse within two weeks""
Holy shit retarded be. death rate slowing 2 months people still saying ""TwO WEekS"". Holy shit everyone fucking dense ""I responsibility 15 employees feed children.""

You mean 15 employees could get unemployment closed would making shit money open pandemic? Even bars left open many customers would weeks would 24/7 coverage overflowing ICUs hospitals turning away sick room? unbearable.  died 4 months ago. Yeah really thrown low-waste shopping loop. groceries pre-covid almost zero waste, proud happy that! get grocery pick-up zero control pack it, can't use containers anymore (pre-packaged bulk foods @ co-op). got groceries yesterday got 8 plastic bags, plus produce bags. 😫 Nice site! thing I’d change making county boundaries thinner/lighter currently take away definition colors, especially counties shaded blue. Yesterday reading something doctor one hell states said patients come hospital refuse mask. Would satisfying one denying entry. There's literally reason expect increase cases lead increase deaths. significant percentage people caught virus last week going die, going quick death. President made ""anti-American"" wearing mask. minds would disloyal wear mask support president. explain youtube video.

 Whaaaaaaaat? waaaaay... filed day received documents work always - received refund first time years February later, stimulus check arrived first week sent out. can, pay early next year. Comrade Putin interesting, thank you. Self-aware enough make twitter post? Sure guess. R.I.P. Restaurants  Trump surrounded spineless cowards. *4th July entered chat* Mostly saw family get together fireworks neighborhood, I’m densely populated area idk bad really was. lot cities cancelled fireworks. I've seen people agree month show. One two weeks symptoms get tested one two weeks go hospital, question stubborn.

Memorial Day May 25th seeing increases nationwide 40 states. month ago spikes dozen states three weeks spikes 20+ states. i'm sick fuck faces whatever want implying actually locked assuming state local gov. totally lying deaths prevent panic. I've heard mass graves FL AZ... Yeah, that's ridiculous. university handing masks (1 reusable 1 disposable), mandating indoor areas (excluding personal offices), anywhere outside cannot maintain 2m/6ft apart. There's fucking way would going work school require them, especially largest city state 30k students 3k employees. user troll.

/u/barber5 things getting crazy MA, realized staying home wasn’t prevent spread virus. Staying home also meant less likely get hurt way would need go hospital all. last thing wanted go ER injury craziness. Anyone stupid enough send kid camp time like allowed parent. agree, 2-3 weeks optimistic. Maybe 2-3 months best. Amazon? Yes. It'd suck yes.

Post Office? I'd say dial back standard operating, triple funding step fill gaps feds response.

Waste Disposal? Heck no. People make trash pretty constantly. Actually roll PPE keep running. /r/snackexchange/ True, kids last people dealing mental health issues. might never fully recover since lack reference normalcy adults have. wearing mask point violating peers basic human rights. wearing one you’re personally affected put everyone around risk infection. Obviously many Americans can’t asked wear mask need required to, otherwise millions lives could risk future. Yeah true. advised general public masks use June - say worthwhile wear properly places social distancing cannot enforced. 

Balance evidence swayed favour - there’s hundreds papers arguing it’s efficacy massive outbreak scenarios like parts US thing work back lockdown style social distancing people falsely believe masks protecting enough go bars restaurants. Lol joke there's actually couple India named newborn twins Corona Covid Masks alone work masks 100% effective. combine social distancing. However, using masks closer 100% means combination masks + social distancing effective.  use math tutor college students. people certainly sociopaths, assure many people legitimately understand 1% million people people 50% 100 people. Looking ks like death rate dropping Alot though , maybe getting reported much ? naive expect someone throw away entire livelihood source income job they've permitted re-open business following mandated sanitation protocols. seriously, told worst mild inconvenience turns adults toddlers love scream ""no"" throw tantrums?! poor fucking bat. ): That’s art, that’s animal cruelty. NEA doesn’t “fight” goddamn thing. work closely administration reach compromises hope earn cooperation, whittling demands get ‘yes’ opposition (using word lightly) We’ll see us come end summer exactly 0 sane teachers feel it’s safe return. keep us going back life threatening situation? I’ll eat words. Toronto re-open now? huge fucking embarrassment. actually lot measures implemented, forced, recommended (with important exceptions, like ban visitations elderly homes, unfortunately came bit late, end March, recommendation local manager decisions) - closed secondary schools university moved remote learning, employers could employees working remotely recommended implement immediately provide enough safe working conditions people remain working place. government made even first sick leave day paid (normally cost discourage taking sick leave without good reason) extended period take sick leave without needing doctor's certificate 7 14 days. people mild symptoms told stay home least 2 days symptoms gone, even said symptoms time associated COVID-19. Parents also told send kids school pre-school (the little ones) mild symptoms. 

Majority deaths connected wide spread infection nursing homes Stockholm region identified result bad practices nursing homes management consequently mitigated government offering large package care workers (so temporary ones need work across several homes can't use properly sick leave) also lack PPE staff; proper quarantine procedures sick staff residents clarified authorities. Making analogy infectious virus car crashes pretty laughable... Thats longest take. usually 3-5 days. go even that; he’s Manchurian Candidate installed specifically dismantle country courtesy Russia. Little know Coronavirus would win half battle them. OMG Y2K planning. Blast past!!

I remember thinking yeah, systems might go doubted going big deal...I food water anything did, couldn’t go work I’d sleep, read books hang pets, sounded pretty nice. Lol

And guess what...it fine. 

Thanks trip memory lane!!

[Remember funniest Y2K memory. aFfEcT aMeRiCa wE'Re sPrEaD Second active mega cluster. Right cases growing Spokane, Yakima, Benton, Franklin maybe Grant/Chelan. 

If coupled spike magnitude Yakima outbreak either Clark, Thurston, Pierce, Spokane, King, Whatcom &amp; Skagit we’d pretty quickly run space. Mandates useless without enforcement, enforcement masks legal, police already bearing brunt backlash scenario create, economy either works us. Perfect storm calamity way go kind generous assumptions possible. morning 4th July tho? would expect number positive results July 4th, regard sample taken. option keep children home $500/wk stipend childcare costs, wonder many would suddenly like ""WE MUST PROTECT CHILDREN!"" ?

Her blue cross blue shield policy cover pregnancy travel insurance expired. wondering strippers handle closures. income tip based I'd surprised they'd make nearly much unemployment checks. Oh thought testing young asymptomatic people, look charts showing hospitalizations deaths! /s

Don't forget forget folks:

2. Two weeks: symptoms appear, presymptomatic cases test positive.
3. Four weeks: symptoms worsen, people need hospitalization.
4. Six-eight weeks: people get worse, die. 

So we've weeks noticeable rise cases, start seeing hospitalizations. soon enough deaths start jumping (already starting happen).  virus done... Nice username said metro area, that's population within city limits. Fuck nba living San Fran, still wonder time around corner, numbers posted California, [are mostly LA bunch fucking idiots akin listen need get shit together. CDC website says US deaths overall decrease, media hype growing cases, new daily case records ? There's jobs *anyone* unless want risk getting COVID pittance, lol! rough adds alot stress time like this. Thankyou kind words though really appreciate seeing good people dire time They're also finding obese people ""super spreaders"" disease thin spend bunch time obese people, even mask usage odds catching fact increase, although would assume risk death still remains pretty low. think vulgar interpretation Swedish strategy. authorities trying keep number infections groups focus risk groups elderly. Totally right view. 

Today, anyone get test either active infection antibodies free regions. regions give test symptoms. 

Sure, number tests logistically analysed increased, it’s way. good thing like man ass. Yes, traveling Occupational Therapist, true experience. Never made FL, worked WV. Thanks pal! That's plan choose American company. painful living country seem want me. Go India, Aug 15. recommended full PPE including masks healthcare workers 6th Jan evidence human human transmission.

It never ever recommended gloves general public saying repeatedly silly hands can’t get infected gloves can’t wash hands bring virus face does. Students die every year frat related cauzes PSU. people retarded it’s unbelievable

Lol says guy refusing quarantine London Ontario would say outside servers staff people, maybe 1 20 ""civilians"" masks.

Not lot masks all. love trolls come DeAtHs, show charts showing deaths, explain timeline pop different thread saying DeaTHs? That's still many. party all? expense feeding, i'm curious, wife drowns odds drown her? car crashes, odds crashing too?   Right; they’ve never equivalent “walking house”. Alabama here.

My boyfriend convinced go private fireworks show field. big deal, right?

Nope. least 200 people there, crammed large tent listening band.

I refused, boyfriend yelled driving back, saying flu worst thing ever happened us. went back hang friends. I'm talking statistical scientific final tally.  I'm talking  literal 3 million cases 130,000 deaths.  real numbers see, percentage falling. read people testing positive COVID-19 second time dead particles virus system actually sick contagious. Depends gym guess, mine super easy keep distance outside classes (which go to) there's barely anyone.  regularly TMC go surge capacity? affect quality care? title one suggested subreddit submission box? want leave climate controlled space it’s 110°+ outside.

 means less sunlight vitamin production aid healthy immune system could possibly aid persons immune response. 

 parents still live Arizona elderly. Sadly father think big deal. 

 work though gave many sources mother pass along him. matter either. Yes let’s nice dialogue debate importance wearing masks. School districts left guidelines little else. local district trying make things work, area means much harder stuff states do. IE lots snow, cold weather etc winter. Viral load matters though far half deaths four states, nursing homes. Oh? Neat, thank you. Maybe I'll go get test antibodies.

I assumed cold ~2 months ago. worked home still self isolated 3 weeks. go much anyway enough food month. (Holfood regular food) You’re missing I’m saying.. Lmfao happen thought would get caught sure remember people giving chinese shit honestly point... seems pretty ducking reasonable I’m 29 get tested yesterday. 
Am going die? No, however hands sickest I’ve ever been. Especially night. I’d love get audacity still say that. 


God hate him, evil, wicked totally incomprehensible.  people falsely believe masks protecting enough go bars restaurants.

This type thinking public health officials avoid. start trying guess psychology policy limits advice start giving weird advice like ""Don't wear masks"" preserve PPP ""Asymptomatic spread uncommon."" later revealed institutions, may well meaning, deceitful lose public trust. 

The job WHO/CDC clearly communicate best practices leave implementation local/national authorities. Sure, we'd seeing small rise start. long way knowing peak would look like. Google ""Straw Man Fallacy"" wonderful life. BURN HELL

STUPID NOBODY entire point initial lockdown example many EU countries: keep number patients manageable hospital care sufficient supply. Netherlands, turned possibility increasing number ICU beds quite limited, even cost problem - there's shortage ICU nurses normal times, let alone pandemic. 
 
So 'ramping capacity' always pipe dream (or right lie) we're talking high percentage extra ICU beds. goes country even money play role. Trump declared one March 13th. though? Florida 6,000 deaths attributed pneumonia far year. 2015-2019 averaged 1,000 5 months... Toronto.announced today zero COVID19 patients currently ICU T-cell study already available preprint, became available day University made press-release. Tbh I'm surprised ""essential workers"" already. right. Thats great example going help people want hear different opinion believe. true. Sadly large portion population trust government believe wouldn’t aloud dangerous! Boris glossed risk. really think people deem safe. wrong. Lies deceit! Uh, no? Vaccine news gets better better. might year things keep trending current direction. Hillsborough?

Seems little disingenuous say ""Tampa Bay hospitals full!"" quote stats county contains part Tampa Bay area. tax returns? They're gonna die virus kills maybe 1% people get it?

Sure. That’s terrible stupid anyone was/is there. curiosity, feel ongoing protests began around Memorial Day weekend? Obviously assisted increase community spread well. disgusted lack common sense disregard public health situation? Honestly similar reporting happened everywhere, around world bet insecure white person cannot anything life, get ranting online trying shit people

NOT TIME, LOSER ! GO SHIT ! like bone spurs? Here's thing, couple said researched American insurance system got insurance going vacation. Americans used insurance companies creating reasons covering costs despite insurance kind. infact common take insurance company court insurance coverage keep paperwork ready.

It's broken system nudges either care live extremely healthy, difficult impossible living standards. honestly want visit Europe consider moving quality life point, coronavirus nonsense like last straw. Lots kids attention span, interest, ability participate Zoom calls video games. 3 year old example. Instead frequently asks big ""cold"" hella depressed finally allowed see one cousin. would cry friends one play with. Poor staff patients. gonna brutal outside heat. contract based, typically like 6 months time. know ahead time it’s extended, look sign another contract another city. plan month whatever want contracts. Yes rightfully so. shut nerd tell us said. Japan failed state. However, suffering severe issues. Much comes institutional racism general conservatism. way I've heard described tourism versus actually living two different worlds.

I think Japan gets many things right, wish US would implement zoning system instead nightmare now. country perfect, first step fixing issues recognize exist. two countries share epidemic history. USA 135,000 deaths, Taiwan 7 deaths, Vietnam 0 deaths, despite hit US. think every country end number dead per capita USA UK, delusional.  safe smart.

Pretty sure Florida's official state motto shall ban cars kill people crashes?

It's funny people keep bringing example short answer yes, probably should. longer answer building cities around walkability public transportation, around car travel, extremely good thing significant positive affect public health among things. Yup.. would prudent let walk in.. territory people.. /s Austin School District planning online studies qusi-home school system. plan year. legit educational standpoint we're fortunate couple permanent stay home family members assist. Chief epidemiologist Viktor Lyashko stated Ukrainians possess herd immunity coronavirus, possible discuss formation vaccine created reach market.  said deputy head Minzdrav live ""Ukraina 24"" channel.  herd immunity amongst either Ukrainians countries world. arrive vaccine developed test accordance written instructions, test less 90%,"" - Lyashko noted.  called conceptions immunity formed even without vaccine, strongest survive weakest die, medieval approach.  approaches cannot applied XXI century,"" - bureaucrat said.  ""Strana"" investigated whether Covid-19 vaccine arrive, create first, much cost.  also cited disease incidence Ukraine 5th July. No, sides firmly ""we can't let lives get way profits"" camp. Every man woman — tried show social solidarity fellow Americans selfishly 

This sums pretty well. still disappointing. Deaths lag cases couple/few weeks so.

They've doubling Georgia's cases weeks, lagging deaths. must super special burger sauce. wish they'd send rest states. may accurate new York less Chicago slower ramp 2-3weeks behind new York. may truth deaths congruent case numbers. Deaths begin decrease recently. Believe me, shit ton cases early would reflected hospital admissions. fucking stupid snowflake ! self aware enough know psychotic idea what's going on. I've checking uline.com, they've stock months estimated availability constantly pushed back July August September. hated cleaning chalk brushes go outside winter lot dust. grade 7 sudden kids liked cleaning chalk brushes whatever, I’d chairs. found machine boiler room cleaning brushes. elementary school could invested little machine child labour cheaper. Buy rent out. Death rate never high point. IFR somewhere 0.2-1.0 range. like it'll shut itself

Yep, one way another going shut down, voluntarily involuntarily. Holy shit funny aquedump! Yeah airborne virus travel forward anyone wants see proof, death rates 7 countries don’t know… told country would sizable portion citizens yelled place sold fatty desserts asked take minimal effort protect health everyone around them, wouldn’t need many guesses get U.S. Ohio state gets one year fields?

That seems like fair trade fucking loser !

you MORON ! Can't argue logic. Cloth masks help great deal reducing transmission new testing shown moderately effective wearer also they're tight fit, especially multiple layers different fabrics. 

Unfortunately think point density becoming high masks longer able help enough keep transmission descending rate say know countries mask? 

It's canada btw - shut everything down. countries South East Asia kept economies mostly going like south korea, mainly used masks combat it. wrong. asked direct question, give direct answer?. simple. entitled piece SHIT, hell talking !

go hell ! many BC social distancing still pretty good freeze them. Newsom caved beach protesters. deaths lag behind new cases weeks. die instantly. bunch new cases today equals increase deaths 3-4 weeks now. old people.... socialized healthcare system Canada notoriously slow 

People still buy lie? man man man Italy Wuhan South Korea Quebec... again. town could something homicides rising 30% There's worries, communication even hospitals pretty wonky right now. 

It's believe you, want know word going around. 

Our ICU space suboptimal say least, shock people transfered even without many people currently admitted. means 1% get sick right? problem. probably cross, 30 less beds friday still decrease, line others, massive drop yesterday, yeah around 400-500 ICU's added two days. Assuming days 140 ICU admitances. Nah, left wing media keeps telling long protesting BLM, immune coronavirus. May testing prioritized severe cases (that require medical care) health care workers. testing capacity pretty low since start continuously increasing. get desired goal 100k tests per week end May, last week performing 75k tests per week (previous two weeks 60k, 45-51k etc), regions providing testing severe cases also mild cases Stockholm also people without symptoms. arrogant , asking OP

who HELL gave right misbehave like anyone !

keep stupid rants !

 pathetic, degenerate **FAILURE** person !! Allegedly lot young people, I’ve also heard lot young people admitted hospital?!?! every thread. Dummies, gotta drink home. Nobody knows, idea could prevented

You'll 2 weeks them, hope enjoy :) Wow, that's sobering thought. really considered that. think people whether official I'll give Doug credit - may suck hard ""normal"" times, he's pretty good pandemic. time around September-October bet... Cool map bro seems like something Detroit (coronavirus). Isn’t mortality rate like 10% world wide? disney opening next week NBA after. close.  sympathies. state run idiots. Can't wait till schools open ... *Ozzy Osborne would like know location* Wait graduate lol 

Jk... kind Animal cruelty. Disappointing unsurprising. Woo hoo! cases rising exponentially hospitals starting get overwhelmed. would want wear pesky masks? worries, put pot covfefe you’ll get time mean costs thousands thousands dollars think cross gulf ferry operating summer plan really work hospitals full, bodies pile up.

Accidents happen, corrected. North South Corona done fucked feel bad workers.

I dont feel bad patients. much fucking warning need know shit isnt safe right now. 

Let's done pandemic already. stay home wear fucking mask. time, we'd like countries. Well, kinda shuts argument down... Harambe? states seeing 

What Southern states seeing result human behavior, nothing weather. People wondering earlier Florida seeing spikes likely due little indoor movement people staying outdoors whenever go out.

Countries like Brazil Australia start seeing spikes winter season started.

New York, Italy, Spain spikes cold months.

I think seems lot contention seasonal COVID people seem think means COVID supposed disappear like influenza instead weakened slightly due heat humidity. COVID influenza, expect diseases act similarly regards seasonal patterns. Huh. didn’t know this. Guess that’s absolutely HATE flying aeromexico. speculation, fucking virus spreads...

Yet, I've decided condition worsens, least show doctor first test results either approach COVID angle, that's had, doctor go test confirm first results test potential causes.

It's really upsetting already struggled inflammation-related health problems March, repeated conjunctivitis primarily white outer corner right eye.

Sounds like lived long, long time ago, sadly. Fuck 'em pity healthcare workers FL. course do. They've able see absolute debacle country made things. would move country didnt quarantine entire nation.

Murica, fuck yeah.

*sob* I'm sorry @milehigh73a - several family members still worried too. it’s 112 degrees today :(( U.S. could stay lockdown 2 years easy. least vaccine already developed, we'd better idea long going take. rally sponsored coronavirus... looks like you’re saying exploitative outcomes make two functionally you, others saying who’s exploiting why, legalities surrounding makes big difference.

Exceptions = board.

Loopholes = legal oopsie people legislation imposed exploit bypass spirit legislation. (Though maybe legal oopsie secretly intentional allow backdoor corruption.)

The latter probably easier fix other, opponents loophole abusers always point spirit law say intended overarching without exception. 

That’s take conversation, anyway. Management take 10% declared pay. take 10% TOTAL. ones manage Big Brown Inc. (or whatever company called).

They take 10% declared 10% gross company (not net). also fuck making everything expense Big Brown Inc. including eating out, etc....

I doubt Schaub looked gross net like ""wow UFC pay enough"". he's moron getting fleeced management like 98% fighters. college level knowledge accounting, fuck you. worked analyst would probably fuck caught on.

It's BACKROOM BONUSES. check cut Big Brown Inc. happens combat sports. backroom bonus might 20 grand hands....like go party win/loss. Dana peels stack 150 K blow night blackjack tables. 

Anyone believes Schaub made 332,000 also believe team sports agents working 10% (32 K) 5 years so.....or $6,400 year average.

I also believe camp cost 15 K. probably paid 15 K salaries sparring partners. Yeah covid big kie government go

http://archive.is/EYfUN I'm actually president MP Clearwater ICU 400% full.

See? Pretty easy lie anonymous forum. Forgive believe you. likely? Really? source isn’t anecdote? Gonna need data statistics decent sample size. really odd. Many ones see posting Twitter super left wings. posts super left wing/activist type related posts us pops randomly months ""struggling"" prior mention struggling. 

I'm saying one also super liberal. truly want believe odd posts dropping now. boyfriend trauma surgery PA get that, means they’re testing every patient comes ICU then? 

Actually, rereading article, it’s even saying nearly 25% ICU patients positive. It’s saying ICUs filling “as” 25% *state’s* tests come back positive. 

I wrote originally thinking they’d test ICU patients respiratory issue. Maybe they’re testing ICU patients maybe they’re article doesn’t address anyway.

Fun fact though: boyfriend said even random MVA trauma patients coming bilateral pneumonia CTs asymptomatic. earlier first locked even hospitals didn’t tests I’m sure patients even ever tested. thought interesting. Telling people get abortions ridiculous telling to. actually biggest problem, inconsistencies people know. Fair enough, it’s 7 years since I’ve seen it. think may different definitions individualism collectivism. view autonomy individual level rather top rule. Individualism doesn’t mean everyone things completely own. love seeing comments downvoted comrade. pretty shortly kids could read they'd really mad shut fuck up. Yes, I've read guidelines. much ""bumper sticker"" I'm american I've never even seen fox news. 70% world ""fucked"" there's deadly disease going around, there's reason blame individual people. evil Dr.Fauci's plan make wear masks

It is? ""People walking around masks. There's reason walking around mask. 

-Dr. Fauci 60 minutes fucking christ guys. know set bar low trump office imagine nation's top doctor lying American public everyone cool is. fuck. 


Part reason people still wearing masks today partly due CDC nation's #1 doctor telling public ""A"", retracking saying actually ""B""

Sure went back original response, trump. see operate? Yell lie walk back... time damage already done. Hopefully collateral damage family.


May odds ever favor. Good luck. Naive way? That’s myth. vaccine cards then? caucasity! January 20th, 1982. need impose lockdown. need enforce mandatory wearing mask, social distancing stop activities put people risk (bars, gym). reason vaccine could 1 year 20 years, nobody knows... great faced return work.

Then started panic attacks depression became unbearable. Work put medical leave absence called told panicking returning seeking help would documentation. told notifying pre-existing disability aggravated situation, offered accommodations. told call HR, found placed LOA day called store. 

Now unemployment hold know get back. depressed picnicking finances. husband disabled can't work. may intensive outpatient therapy program. back antidepressants first time almost two years. left home except drive preschool graduation son quick trip non crowded beach (at suggestion physician take baby steps out) since March 15th. 

This sucks. CARES act never took account prior like pre-existing severe chronic anxiety depression. fit boxes keep unemployment. can't make enter business work shop. Idk I'm going do. Maybe I'll die family get huge life insurance payout. They'd better off. Beaches closed. Full stop. Everything completely vital individual human survival closed. even open minimum capacity actually feet us terms handling pandemic. Yeah... that, agree... care providers. NOVEL coronavirus though look Texas Medical Center: growth Covid ICU bed occupancy: 4.3%. first time see 4%, exponential growth growing. Super-exponential growth? currently looking whether without masks retail sector,”

I doubt Germany right thing despite moronic musings. point article says transmission low Germany, could put end mask bylaws. Transmission low THANKS mask bylaws.... variable. go trade/arts school half departments went totally online, lot can't function way (good luck studying glassblowing zoom!), they're sort quarantine dorm, significantly reducing numbers, housing lottery placement predetermined got thrown window obviously. folks even know departments yet, anyone hybrid department also lost housing. bunch kids forced take year off, mess. glaring Alaska loophole though... Doesn’t seem like article quotes two Texas hospital system CEOs concerned capacity. 

And point anyway? things fine going according plan? 

New york weird comparison — recall many people died, right? People refuse mask refused ICU bed...when enough go around. whole goddamn suitcase little White Castle burgers. can't believe even single one Canada. 

Any burger place let's order cardboard suitcase full burgers place wanna go. literally top post answering questions, posted 2 hours decided post this. wish Indian practice shaming slapping back someone’s head acceptable USA Hope it. need influence family, friends, neighbors. definitely going lose money can't afford unemployment past extra 600$ ends. can't survive little. coworker go Florida another Texas. Supposed pay difference. often happen. Hey, I’m little bit confused. cases reported today?! Also, record high America? world? Twice unlikely though. ones they're telling us  playing bad, sitting crowded stadium audience See genius. analysis spot on, aside beat overcensorship Automod here. It’s simple, censor ourselves! 

This definitely [redacted]s fault idea [redacted] meant [redacted] said would tired much winning truth go date. news media yesterday's news discredited. 

It's article, in-vitro study explains Zinc + ionophore kill Covid-19. Texans *proven* go back work increase spread COVID! That’s Governor said he’s never wrong!

/s Weak Thank fuck overly panicky individuals power. b/c would closer 25% lmao.  Canada, we're hovering around 300 new cases day, weeks. new cases seem able pinpoint they're coming - farm, nail salon, long term care residence, etc. 

It's pretty rare come across someone refuses wear mask, even someone thinks hoax. We're burnt it, practically everyone least begrudgingly following directives health authorities politicians. 

It comes healthy balance trust authority accountability. We're educated enough usually able spot bullshit, health/political leaders enough good get people buy in. 

As result, practically everywhere country we're well, staying vigilant. also think data got? I'm chilling working way Resident Evil remakes. Great games! confirm, Im fire fighter died wearing mask, got better though. said post farther homemade mask Material lab tested almost N95 Design lab tested pass respirator fit test.

I need mask like everyone around wore them, don't. Masks mandated here.

So wear mask whose components (material design) know lab tested provide inhalation protection. Yet never report average 45 deaths day. state full seniors, number fishy hell. 

I'm calling it, corrupt politicians hiding true deaths purpose excuse open Orlando parks earlier $$$. PRIVATE PROPERTY! Call cops drag fat ass outside property. PRIVATE PROPERTY dont want REASON cant there. Obviously PIG doesnt know showcasing dense thinking ability going instead PUBLIC PROPERTY. use together -er -est ending. prepped I’m saying anytime forced. I’m saying it’s selfish stupid take it. Important distinction live near park, there's definitely fourth category ""people like go, go often expensive and/or crowded."" love Disneyland, think best LA-area parks, really immerses experience. Galaxy's Edge amazing fills Star Wars geek heart awe.

But time buy tickets, realistically buy hotel room (even though live within hour's drive, want whole 8am-12am, I'll need hotel nights after), take day work (because really want go weekend), pay parking, pay food souvenirs... I'd rather spend $400 whatever proper vacation. not, no. pastor uncle took kids. “If restrict sample population patients respond well drug, patients HCQ show marked improvement” Potentially hard Dude buy 20 dollar gas mask save money. might feel weird least safe. wore mine nevada visit state. btw probably stupidest state I've ever visited. context theyre putting lives line. Every single medical worker. Fish rots head. trump agree something. Wow, less US, even without insurance. socialized medicine. Free nominal insurance, $50 max without it. That's like blaming pencil failing test No. He's shit. shit mean true. happened. quit. Classrooms going death traps. force back classroom January, I'm retiring. study limitations. shows overall mortality 18%; 13% HCQ group, 20% HCQ + AZM, 22% AZM alone 26% medicine group.     
But table, also see medecine group highest rate older people years old), average age 71 53 HCQ group. another contributing factor?    
More importantly, 79% HCQ patients received steroids (Dexamethasone?) 36% med patients.     
They seem imply differences [don't    
I'm statistician surprises little. well declared conflict interests, think fuss done Lancet study...       
Anyway, study change much. HCQ might little efficient sometimes hardly ""game changer"" promised. Yet opening economy Even absolute impressive people trying things right catch this. proof careful. People keep telling got nasal swab “only goes half way in” “isn’t bad” ...no test wrong. It’s brain scrape hurts like hell. Sigh. First book Revelation. 2nd, Bible clearly warns pestilence, earthquakes, droughts famines, kinds natural disasters would continue Christ's return. Correct. USA went full tilt blew stack. Went chip leader short stacked.

Zoinks. schools expect us send kids school expose families this? isolated since middle March. husband work always wears mask grocery pickup quick trip peak hours inside small grocery store. family help. slept room since middle March limit exposure case get exposed. know 1200 kids been, know families been, know ignoring CDC. We've done supposed beyond ensure safety family supposed turn school system sickness runs rampant every year. end doctor bills too, negative effects felt us us catch this. want homeschool idea even start! thought sure would offer online whoever help decrease number person students. I'm going start calling Monday try get voice heard living state numbers rising yet one cares seems like people making decisions school board! $15/hr starting pay. hourly employees making closer $25/hr, x1.5 pay Sundays, major holidays paid. 401k match contribution well. 

Not sure monthly health insurance premiums now, left 10 years ago, cost $23 per pay period PPO, dental vision. single job corporate America come close health benefits Costco covered. Reported deaths due coronavirus down.

Meanwhile deaths due pneumonia, influenza, etc higher normal. Maybe lied claimed Canadian family? nuclear family grandparents? honestly wish rapid healthy recover end it. Please consider heroic act wearing mask safety others potentially yourself. say non-American fear guys. I've never much restaurants even covid. anti social eating takeout life. Bloody hell also going say Trump great job information time? Username checks Form understand include surge beds. that. Social media obliterated country's society, everyone hates now. Twitter banned. Florida marked pneumonia deaths first 6 months year previous 5 years combined Go page US - 

Then scroll graph shows Daily New Deaths United States. 

There's two little boxes - one 3 day moving average &amp; one 7 day. Click - see average numbers deaths per 3 days every 7 days. 

You'll see mortality rate peaked April declining since. staying away Lake Tahoe (Nevada)? TX Gov. touts reopening getting people back work lifting restrictions...but tells everyone safest place home, home unless really must leave, blames people making bad choices rising infection rates. Like, businesses reopen everyone voluntarily stays home safe different stayed closed! vaccine, approved vaccine distributed hundreds millions people enough time passing certain number people taking increase confidence bad stuff?  people killing us. MDs human thus fallible.

But blasphemous doubt them, right? Um no, situation really change much private insurance single payer system.

For example, 2008 recession New York increased rate wealthier tax payers state could put money public services like Medicare Medicaid. Nope, 100 percent wrong.

They even explain precisely weren’t affirmatively recommending people wear masks article linked. Which, yet again, different recommending people don’t wear masks. 

Are people even reading articles link? mindlessly parroting whatever alt-right talking point intended discredit undermine experts hear? come country abide laws health regulations, IMPRISONED expense quarantine. 

I'm tired ""I'm number one"" dogshit attitudes. Start team player stay fuck out. I’m going get backlashed badly this. bad country. feel bad many you. damn patriotic country blinds you. I’m U.K., far perfect nhs pay taxes. Schools good paid taxes also. aren’t perfect much better America imo fine automatically come deportation Yeah. zombie apocalypse we'd people demanding freedom choose get bitten. Canadian reads interacts people forums like Reddit knows group together. also know listening anchors proper news channels (I think Rachel Maddow superb), idiots among make whole. 

Hang there, want President Biden step heal America, volunteer time October. No, all, casinos packed Stateline Incline Village/King's Beach much better. story lake understand billionaire narcissist gives shit covid-19 figure based tested infections. Tested infections thought 10% actual infections. Generally research antibody studies giving figure 0.5 1% death rate ( would 5 10 times seasonal flu). However, situation health service breaks people dont get treatment rate predicted like 5%). wonders for-profit healthcare system US. appreciate post here, agree points. infection already spreading November,which explains 5-8 percent propagation virus began testing antibodies April. CHOICE second lockdown 2 months. proper lockdown time. Torn labrum rotator cuff here.

Surgery cancelled twice, scheduled 14th. God hope cancelled again. dead arm hurts hand weak. good website tracking travel restrictions there? specifically interested American perspective, things like countries prohibiting people countries visiting also US states/cities requiring states quarantine. Jesus christ purebdelusion 😳😳😳🤦‍♂️ 25% capacity reservations required. 

Everyone needs wear mask. 

Temps checked thermal cameras enter. Okay multilayered issue.

1. breathtaking lack critical thinking skills
2. time distrust media experts
3. (seemingly) contradictory advice offered media, experts studies.

Numbers one two surprise anyone i'll elaborate number three progressions issues. 

RE: Masks

1. told, initially, wear mask would effective.
2. told purchase masks healthcare workers needed them. effective not? Evidently work healthcare workers us?
3. told wear masks effective stable supply general populace. (The real issue stated begin with)

RE: Social Distancing + Stay Home Orders

1. told stay inside avoid non essential travel avoid spreading virus.
2. found likely get infected enclosed space longer lengths time much less likely get infected outdoors move. Also Vitamin sunshine effective keeping immune system active observing good sanitary standards staying indoors jeopardizes that.
3. Protests safe/safe would increase/slow spread depending protesting. Large, tightly packed social gathering always consistently no-no.

There's also seeming disappearance seasonal flu deaths, inconsistent reporting deaths, throwing Covid patients care homes elderly (Nice move Cuomo) inconsistent reactions viral epidemics. know estimates 646'000 deaths annually regular flu OUTSIDE flu epidemics? number probably closer 1 million annually add shut entire world yearly basis? No, fact keep chugging along. Meanwhile Covid deaths within normal parameters compared flu deaths (yes know Covid flu virus, sample use respiratory illness comparison, death age group almost identical). 

Nobody knows believe trust anymore wonder people skeptical? We're living world we're gas-lit daily sides. 

All really need know right Covid-19 new, infectious vaccine. Take reasonable precautions prevent endangering life others, wash damn hands cough/sneeze sleeves. know basic hygiene tips parents taught 4 years old? Stay safe there! agree stuff except food lmao. Theres much variance food US, especially southern california live Seek medical help, please. “The Palm Beach Post reported Stephen Cooper, electrical engineer New York lived part-time Delray Beach, Florida area, died March 28 Delray Medical Center due COVID-19. 78.“


SHIT ARTICLE SHIT. Individualistic culture ""the american dream"" live well-run society people help eachother, instead prosper individually hide property. need build statues hero healthcare workers. could put old Confederate statues used be. rolling 7 day average still 550 deaths day, seems like astronomically large number something kill anyone 6 months ago. sure getting 100-200 deaths day from? lowest since March 271 day non-working day known undercounts.

The goes gatherings No, I’m pretty sure they’re gonna let us die. R/iamverysmart know two healthcare workers independently went vacation. One Puerto Rico one Panama city...and neither one wearing masks public either 🙄 thought border closed. How'd get in? hold citizenship residencies something? First, deaths lag cases. Get infected, go hospital, get admitted, receive treatment, die. cases found today deaths weeks. 

Second, NY, almost cases NYC metro region. Mostly NYC itself. Remember capacity issue. Death worse triage, nurses doctors spread thin, PPE runs out, ventilators run out, oxygen storage runs out, etc. So, part problem cases state, hospital Rochester, capacity city hospitals over. Florida cases throughout state, cases end different hospitals, localities whether hit capacity. 

Next, NY one first states hit. peak NY April. Globally, virus less understood less time work treatments. dealing something understand less, results good.

Protests boosted numbers either.  opening malls, hair salons, etc has, they're indoors.  Less airflow. fair seems like entire healthcare system US needs reworked... idea would it, copying likes UK, Norway, Germany Switzerland. increase number positive tests lead increase number deaths.

When exactly? Virtually every European nation one peak cases per day , followed peak deaths per day one three weeks later. US second peak cases, likely hit maximum 80,000 100,000 weeks Yeah they’re 120 years old multiple underlying health conditions!

So far:

1. assume count confirmed cases actually includes probable cases.

2. Even given source rejected data favor media tells you. You’re fucking idiot rates positives 6 per 100,000 great, also terrible.... DPH wants it.


The spike hospitalizations SF due transfers regions. See statement SFDPH increase hospitalizatoons. 18 24 new hospitalizations regional cases SF number hospitalizations increased 50% last week, rising 43 June 22 67 June 29, including 18 patients transferred San Quentin State Prison, Fresno Imperial counties, city said statement.


Source: article continuously live updates, updated SFDPH re: hospitalizations may removed article time. look Sweden - 

Their positive tests increased, mortality rate decreased. 

There's many variables testing though - tests do, positive results get, countries tested lot early on, less later vice versa. know much read that. 

Regardless, look Europe - countries eased lockdown measures society returning normal - happening gradually last 6-8 weeks. mortality rates kept declining. Texas doesn’t lack resources. lack leaders brain. politician undermine top medical specialist. don’t education knowledge. hurts see crap.

I'll never forget, perhaps even forgive life blatantly wronged humanity crisis cut ties soon appropriate. Big Gretch got backs. Glad voted her. dude absolutely horrible, dudes fools potentially lethal pandemic. asking source doesn’t exist, since country (except maybe Iceland) knows actual rate infection is, reply question testing source? 

Really? realize USA world's powerful superpower, honestly feel like way things like treated lately shows lot weakness. Sure could crush countries pulp weapons, political divide really seems leave things open manipulation other, along half people country always disagreeing causes chaos. ""gotcha"" edgy logic think is. less beds usual that's problem, period. Asking they're COVID-19 make wiser Ben Shapiro whatever little chimera today. shortage beds shortage beds, regardless feeling matter. fine. 98.8 completely normal nothing concerned least. Shed virus.  Yeah, that’s way cheap. mention instituted weeklong curfew response protests, stricter anything we’ve seen come e governer regards COVID. doubt. get schools desperate parents students need recognize what's going decide what's best. can't come without mask. charged sent away Oh, agree protests distracted people taking pandemic seriously.

But none matters, virus care politics pay every little sassy comment downplays effects virus. Ugh f\*gs much suggests uncontrolled nationwide outbreaks “round 2”. People careful, aren’t traveling lot, likely partial immunity (a significant chunk cities), testing/tracing able quickly break transmission chains now. flares like cities around world hopefully contained *local* restrictions rather nationwide ones. makes sense. Thank explanation. You’re right Coronavirus must work weekends CTE helluva drug.  see kids wearing masks properly place Seattle, even wear places really need (like front yard) - agree it'll huge disruption first, time kids accept normal piece clothing like shirt pair socks, kids start policing kids it. getting first hurdle novel thing test boundaries on.

What I've thinking though many people we're gonna years trained childhood wear masks public, affect later life. Reminds Seattle 90s police massive campaign jaywalking sent officers talk classrooms it, handed fake ""tickets"" kids, etc - spot folks went Seattle public schools era compulsion wait crosswalk signal empty street. Figure 10, 20 years we'll young adults wearing masks around reason feels right. Given 5th protects incriminating yourself, would seem one that's confused.

You answer subpoena. assert 5th amendment rights. judge can, absolutely would, overrule grounds apply here, there's risk incriminating yourself, since would simplest thing world given ""use immunity"" statements.

At point *have* speak *will* fined and/or jailed judge's discretion. That's know school district care ""family"" schools claim be.  

I've teaching 10 years now. school districts. No, crazy. get it! send kid school go work... Georgia here... crowded Florida’s beaches anyways? use pictures london blanket statement whole country true, attended multiple pubs yesterday really busy part rather tame Yeah, everyone saying going back office gradual. Saving economy matters.

I work office boss fighting tooth nail prolong home office. end whoever live take precautions higher risk soon leave home. 

At office floor less populated least 15 people, summer A/C help propagate droplets someone believe covid without mask. assumption phrase question. point data needed conclude cloth masks ineffective. Hispanics represented essential work. That's good reporting. seen level detail WDW staff before.

Nobody thought hotel &amp; stadium staff would quarantined, I'm disappointed see regular testing. 

That huge hole. going “Colbert show” tone :) possibility individuals transmit virus differently? like displays different symptoms person person. virus always transmitted pathways? 

Also potentially mutations virus, could transmitted differently? I’m asking lot questions here, don’t expect answer all. appreciative information share since said you’ve done deeper dive masks. nothing. high schools either went online learning let student body select online learning, would help free enough physical building space elementary middle schoolers could relocated ways actually permit better social distancing (rather 25-35 kids crammed small classroom portable). 

My daughter's public high school offered food box pickups every week since closed March, summer long, students need food still get it. solutions many problems, creative collaborative. Fairfax county VA July 10th decide whether kids go school 2/5 days per week end August social distancing remote learning. cannot change decision made. 

The social distancing option kids separated, wearing masks, washing hands sneezing, maybe temperature checks. 

Admittedly VA better many states right way plan going go without creating new cases schools. 

We choose distance learning. hope others same. seen 7 day rolling average specification may be. thought limit 40 cases per 100,000 ppl span 14 days. case similar nneasure available box. 

Just click ""14 days"", select per capita. show cases per 1000. multiply number 100. look list places, click/hover specific region show info window. Currently Blekinge Kronoberg 40. Skåne slightly above. factors ithan infection count involved know would depend particular office's culture. years back made appointment GP thinking flu (in summer). receptionist immediately grabbed mask told wear even though suspicious would flu summer. Turned nasty kidney infection.  Maybe safety state rely existence healthy supply slave labor. hard time breathing mask can’t imagine would easy breathe respiratory virus  Thank much video. I'm 75 wear mask faithfully. live senior housing North Carolina - home redneck. people wearing masks. said want look cool. get funny looks people wear mask gloves go store. I'm going 5 months isolation people like learn write think would lost mind now. Thank caring.   think confused people downvoting, edit clarified point trying make.

""But one case obviously wrong"" could taken complete opposite argument trying make - okay deny cake, let maskers in. 

For worth, upvoted :) Oh young one, lots learn. would ever thought drunk people couldn’t respect boundaries? country sense, could voted England. feel like it’s way soon open pubs pretty much social place involves alcohol prevented thing. mayor put mandatory quarantine notice sent family suppose visit. mugs don’t believe virus probably would started arguing masks... thank goodness don’t quarantine money dead people dont buy things. Pubs opened ENGLAND. rest UK selfish morons. 99% kill people proper medical care. Proper medical care nearly available virus runs population. whole point flattening curve. Keep 99% people alive get it. What’s 19th century shit? think he'll announce week. think trying avoid lockdown 4th. parents plan go Florida end month. wish they’d close boarders allow tourists in. Won’t happen 🙄 exactly statements as: evidence/study suggest virus transmit human human. even take long determine virus airborne? knew diamond princess ¡Muchas gracias! :) Im sending kid back person homeschooling. mean air travel. Anyone? couple years America Covid deniers, people think hundreds thousands people dying government conspiracy... shit, now! It’s balancing act, business can’t stay locked forever, options? Idk many people dislike idea 3rd party candidates. mean guess two big parties controlled field long hard get anyone else one two. reviewing study, bought provide particular narrative study would benefit one paying. live small rural white midwest US. town pop less 7k.

I understand realizing many people actually here. 

The failure education country unbelievable. Geez escalated really fast. I'd love see numbers one day per capita people ""anxiety"" around world. I'd bet Americans 10x higher country comes mood stabilizers psychotropics yet one blinks eye.

Suck wear mask, stay home. Studies seem suggest detect active infections using PCR swab tests post-infectious serological testing inaccurate insofar offers proof presence antibodies, whether person previously infected not. Anecdotally know thousands millions unconfirmed cases. money allotted large number businesses get it. significant portion US bail corporations worth millions left small mom pop shops fend themselves. get initially promised would forgiven, IRS (tax people) drafted rules way used many people money already. paid back thought going grant. 

I paid aaaaaall 2019 taxes last week. tax break, refund (I run sole proprietor small business). Yes losing people infection doesn’t drop first person catches dead, cease infect others. dummy catches Chili’s can’t stay away El Presidente even one day might go infect family, coworkers, maybe gets sick enough need go hospital puts staff others risk. don’t govern protect Darwin idiot. govern protect everyone. Florida failing everyone. Wealthy people self isolated stayed home. farms, meat plants, restaurants, etc. mostly minority labor. cases New York essential workers need take subway interact people throughout day. class issue, skin color issue. Ánimo suerte! Teachers deserve hazard pay we’re asking this. risking life thing 30-40k year. CDC pandemic team hacked 2018 &amp; admin actually worked leading world scientists, stuck trying find info &amp; arguing face coverings. 

CDC's advice still regular flu, wash hands, cover mouth coughing, etc. face cover recommendation appear til recently. 

Before admin, CDC would publish kinds articles information illnesses, oil spills, pollution etc. wiped took office. much u check way back machine. 


Sad Masks useless. airborne. 250 scientists 32 countries sent letter confirming 100% airborne droplets. everyone cut mask crap. Good luck everyone. people dying? soon major health body G7 country declares pandemic second one reject notion, I'm back close normal, probably sanitizing hands before. Yeah, hatemongering business owner fine, asking people look one another Goddamn imposition. schools don’t open fall setting back decades progress women workforce. wear alright...under chin/neck 😒 99% plus little risk getting seriously sick - everyone else infect they're a/pre-symptomatic? whole thing shown true colors America. America deeply broken society. We’re mass. want go visit. think it’s stupid. Hey now. 

I didn’t nothing.

I kinda shutdown bars, vaguely let citizens know responsible actions.

Can’t go along flip flopping mountains data advice nearly every public health expert 180° currently FL. Flip-flopping weakness, know CoVID19 preys weak, staying course. afford it, adds costs. pay premium can, lot people can't. also tipping 25% least people exposing to. Tbh think half people think trolls really trolls true thought process them.  yeah I've never seen people laughed wearing PPE. Drove Ohio today. People GLARE wearing mask. Like flat angry defiant. stupid mask. Indiana WORSE. 111F yesterday Phoenix area. plus fact car air conditioners much car stopped dangerous, indeed. 
But also shows important testing is, people willing suffer order get test. Get outside folks. Trump Pence don’t science degrees listen scientists. surprised? This, kinda post. even real? mean reason cover faces cough sneeze wtf, right? sure getting downvoted 100 percent right hospital capacity general, think asking, release delayed data many beds COVID. data delayed, though. week said, don’t want panic anyone, still care you, but..... it’s fine line causing public chaos. ERs reputation slow aren’t dying right second (heart attack, example). suspect don’t huge number beds normal week, doesn’t take ton over-full. Please ask stay FL. We're starting get control MA. bad.. kids go school done? go home infect family. since school, think parents go? parents go work infect coworkers go home infect family. All-cause mortality would show that. isn’t anything close NY, Mass, New Jersey seen. 

There obviously lot undercounting I’m saying Covid impact Texas etc nowhere near northeast. bad year one neurotic me. hypochondriac tendencies normal situations, I'm asking Corona daily. Luckily causing much anxiety, except today, I've seen family first time since February. People contagious *before* start showing symptoms. I'm definitely wearing mask. currently overwhelmed denying people taking tests. Also, uncle took blood test one drive stations came negative (he possibly exposed work). didn’t feel confident 3 day waiting test day came back positive. RGV currently overwhelmed every single medical resource. Get out. Whose president pro tempore? agree pro-life movement? smart reopening. People need wear masks practice social distancing. businesses like bars gyms severely limited open all. Wind tends turbulent, like going carry nice stream virus people, chance quickly mix particles point downwind viral load hitting would negligible. say impossible, data seen shows outdoor transmission low virus gets diluted quickly compared static indoor air.  Perhaps rest face attractive, usually make around eyes without mask. would literally living based recommendations. It’s ignorance point. States reopened weeks weeks. long take Coronavirus kill people? submission removed because


**Titles must edited source.** submissions must submitted original title submitted article applicable. article uses caps title, changed [title Editorialization via title editing kind likely removed. ([More believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* hospitals somewhat tight-lipped beds. They’ve admitted add beds, without staff, beds that, beds. (In words, may well home bed.) Basically they’ve said staffing staff hospital. staff surge some, point they’ll overwhelmed, beds won’t help. Someone admit care them. conjecture, but, essentially, like happened NYC, bring staff care patients. wasn’t much space staff there, too. Except many states surge once, extra help come from?

I hope answers question. There’s talk overflow beds even hospital, without staffing (first limitation) equipment (second limitation), doesn’t matter beds. Dying free, death not. Lots money made dead, is. Yeah, feel like there's lot conversation parents teachers less kids glad see post.

Young children cannot learn zoom. 5 6 7 year old getting distance learning getting educated. Children also need social interaction peers. certain windows time children need learn social skills brains change things become much difficult.

Some children victims abuse rely schools escape abusers. Children less privilege need schools chance make better life themselves, children overall less capable learning distance learning.

For couple months, reasonable consequences. wait vaccine, may end generation uneducated unsocialized children, horrible society children. need figure bring children back school can't wait till vaccine. likely means closing many sectors economy (in US, know countries both).

In US, prioritized people going bars education socialization next generation. insane. Maybe late fix it. anything opposite huge spike pneumonia deaths. Yea, (27 years old worrying old immunocompromised parents). want money asking people bottom totem pole? thought already knew this. Rising umass freshmen here, heres thing. Yes dorms open, 99% classes online. You’re essentially paying live jail cell dorm taking online classes. Debating take gap year since start anyways. expected open say,"" brain cells."" There's spike deaths - increased case numbers reflect increased testing. deaths going increased cases (and won't) shows death rate low indeed. Much lower told fear.  

How much want bet 

1) Tx 'plenty death yet'  
2) healthcare system overwhelmed.

Don't give bullshit, see happened Sweden countries lockdowns mandatory masks all. Schools remained open restaurants. Politics Well, he's anti ""keep parents safe"" so, really nicking pits exact cause stupidity That’s lot assumptions without documented facts I'm Hilary. Fuck idiots. According CDC take two days roughly two weeks incubate propagate symptoms individuals (if symptoms manifest all; reports presymptomatic asymptomatic instances documented). makes problematic pinpoint duration contagiousness difficult know long asymptomatic carriers contagious seldom realize virus get identified. enough students collectively decide want pay tuition show up

Except lose scholarship, financial assistance, even admission enrolling. us 18-20 something privilege take stand 30k even hopes school change mind. US hospitals for-profit generally. Caring COVID patients bring much money - actually makes lose money cancel elective surgeries. 

They don’t want extra capacity dealing COVID patients. like McDonalds wouldn’t ask extra capacity feed homeless, for-profit hospital isn’t going make extra capacity COVID patients. 

It ends governments responsibility, great example for-profit healthcare dumb. Shock horror got, ticking time bomb it, matter time. Mayor Kate Gallego (D) said Sunday pace Arizona's reopening indicated residents coronavirus crisis and, turn, spurred record number new opened way early Arizona. one last states go stay-at-home one first reemerge. reemerged zero sixty,"" Gallego said ABC's ""This Week."" ""We crowded nightclubs handing free champagne, masks. 20 44-year-olds, demographic, really led explosion, we’ve seen growth area. We’re seeing lot people go large family gatherings infect family later added, ""I think nightclubs open, sent signal had, again, defeated COVID and, obviously, case."" Hillary Duff’s Tuff Muff believe CDC numbers include reported cases.  Certainly large number people flu never go doctor.  Covid19. authors accounting unreported flu Covid19 cases estimates. attack rate households nowhere near 100 percent think think realize many people actually live America, 1% population number mentioned above. Can't leave fact lot people woefully ignorant infringing one's right selfish fucktard much un-american. feel murderer? Denial one hell drug friend lot ppl high mofo right now. Seems like whole country paying last couple elections. country wellspring malignant entitlement... Really annoying parents trying push keep 2 kids school “for foreseeable”. don’t money childcare we’re work, plus need proper education back.. 

I guess they'll risk lives go back school, then. great parent. understand point making. Blaming leaders inherent blaming ourselves. we, people actually follow closures distancing mask-wearing, actually differently? know issue ourselves, literally everyone else. fault stupid people around us wanna follow safety guidelines. Part stupid people involve stupid leaders choose ignore problem emboldens stupid people ignore problem.

So said, point making? people actually care take proper precautions well aware issue *only* leaders. problem stupid people care. meant fix short term, right now? Long term, melting pot issues distilled cultural celebration ignorance hatred ""other"" need addressed. that's immediate fix. wonder many Uber drivers harassed passengers don’t want wear masks. much pressure get 5-star reviews, imagine (more than) hesitant enforce common sense rules. However, also Doctor went see day put COVID air quotes said it. Idiots everywhere. So, think making masks mandatory everyone way go. need able say “rules rules” suffer personally/professionally it.  people miss carrying small talk work like others interacting much used to. busy bodies scheduled virtual happy hour.

I suspect participate, conversation eventually migrate shit person aberrantmoose is. People going die hospital hallways unable say goodbye families. fucking waste life could avoided. [here ya Great, got swabbed thursday (on volition, I'm moving healthcare job warehouse job wanted make sure I'm exposing people high contact area) told 3-5 days Labcorp. :( # years back local hospital cut wrong leg patient, believe Tampa Bay. don’t really dog fight like facts. I’m sure understand LE works. Abbot sign new LAW. signed proclamation same. la county ran party? That's impossible! agree: 
 Governments make money. They're business profit/loss motive. provide services. There’s evidence protests blame. It’s parties bars No, doesn't. Even perfectly normal Tampa Bay hospitals frequently run ICU beds, mean dangerous situation add increase C19 cases Also debate whether white house bosses let CDC tell full extent know.  Maritimes even letting people provinces recently. think lovely people Gander would hospitable right now. Good bot 🤷‍♀️ Sounds like job robot could pretty well. Churches hold services 10am 12pm then?? sent hospital ships weren’t used. Set camps places overflow broke didn’t need them. 

Did miss ship going NYC? Find recent source many infected. Sweden even trying determine many infected, course statement true. here. thats protect people care for. chief health officer said: safe, calm, kind. 
Although live, I've never experienced called out, comments see online really idiotic bugs hell me.

Being called sheep, really? see part community, naturally wanting protect it. wear mask really small chance may protect me, already sick, lessen chance infect others! think heroic thing do, least do! Im enjoying this! want things go back normal too!

To honest, bad people making comments isolationists living grid. creditcards, smartphones, they're f'ing facebook. Like, wtf people?!?!

This supposed one line comment turned rant. picture really good one, tbf. Here's another one:

http://newsen.pku.edu.cn/images/content/2020-02/20200211191118812513.jpg Really? surgery, helped pain, didn’t feel high. Wonder affects people differently. statement faulty. Compare number tests many would need even 1/500 population infected. insignificant. yes, true US. need bleach, detergent common soap work too. see terms tenside, surfactant packaging, effective removing/inactivating virus too. work non authoritarian country like United States. doesnt need stop. go protests almost daily, risky transmission. always outdoors, everyone wears masks usually moving. experts also said protests leading new clusters C19 cause backlog.

Also worth adding even perfectly normal Tampa Bay hospitals frequently run ICU beds, mean dangerous situation add increase C19 cases deaths going staggering. older population matter time. Life life. Sucks nothing watch protect ourselves. throwing extra fuel good measure. People 50s typically much economical power. Spending money, properties, businesses, etc.

Young people anywhere near much compared them. fucked economy, lockdowns? Someone needs throw garbage. Make douchebags use curbside online. 🤷‍♀️ difficult decouple. good reason decouple? good reason start NOW?

It's like 40 years since Americans seriously considered unified industrial policy country outsourcing someone else worry about. ...and countless unreported. Good know. extremely careful. go anywhere except grocery store every two weeks wearing full-face respirator. Unsure careful he's been.  honestly think happened four weeks NPR saying field hospitals empty field hospitals closing?

Think suddenly got slammed COVID cases, cleared all, suddenly decided shut down? posted thing! feel bad local school district they’re best didn’t create disaster. legitimately want kids receive food education kids teachers safe. guidance federal state government, funding getting cut, states social safety nets already extremely thin don’t really lot options. sucks. OK, weird cold thing almost 3 weeks now, it’s really mild it’s kind annoying, CVS swab test came back negative, go get nasopharyngeal test? get Covid sure attend one rallies Yeah everyone left knew romneycare shit . ""working across aisle moderate solution"" everyone claims want Yea. know highest deaths world. third world country Great way put insane. Denmark well. Moderna also keeps bunch super fratty stuff Wall Street good look them. They've never released vaccine executives already cashing pandemic, financially ruin millions Americans. Andrew Yang understands value society. Yeah, problem can’t trust called official reports. They’ve caught lying. doubt us plebs ever know true numbers. happens, Modi blame China Muslims, everyone move on. First all, understand logic; virus even break Arizona big way summer, matter intense there's way know even worse winter.

Secondly, Arizona's hot might practically reverse seasonality. Whereas everyone else spends time outside summer retreat indoors A/C hellscape place becomes. Well tiny arms legs due years years surgeries pretty pro-mask get saying. fuck he's 84? see people half age worse skin physique. guy must go hard body science clearly working I’m sure grade 9 grade 8, kids still put chairs desks night. eat classroom desks (no cafeterias) responsible cleaning desks prior leaving recess. school waste free recycling organic waste, garbage sent home lunch bag. Fuck yeah! never win anything! It’s lucky day! Worldometers handy use, ""its accuracy methodology questioned"" (according really, month 10-30 cases day, point opened up, one wore masks basically one shit like over. cases peak closed down. yeah, i’ll tell virus infect me, that’ll work magic. wonder 500,000 people who’ve died didn’t think that. Texas here. husband teaches high school I'm full-time sub. quit. We're agreement we'll go back state Texas gets shit together. Imagine supermarket ran special program, every 100th customer drowned parking lot. son died twice revived. stay hospital month close air lifted another hospital (thank goodness didn't). wife also stay week. 'Murica Correct. People always justify path least resistance. 

If shrug wearing mask saying, 'its flu' 'only old people die', wear mask. tell they're going pay $500 fine wear mask, lot harder justify immediately foreseeable loss. realistic alternatives way harm MILLIONS children?

The issue realistic alternative. 

Look what's happening daycares. Look what's happening reopened schools countries. open schools back up, students staff test positive, shut right back down. thing gained thousands dead teachers - older experienced ones really can't afford lose. There's already teacher shortage. opening back prematurely make finally vaccine treatment fewer skilled, experienced teachers help catch kids back up.

It's hard, cold fact virus going hugely disrupt education wellbeing millions children way prevent it. Apparently sort incentive get people wear masks besides death. think would enough. Drivers cancel rides even pick penalty. help people take mask inside, though. CDC number estimate symptomatic infection fatality rate. might seem like odd choice since influenza also large proportion asymptomatic cases.

The real answer really don’t know many people influenza infects. Wow good her! Yeah, auto-delete sub ridiculous times - I've responded directly point number times, referencing articles science-based positions related discussion, etc. one keyword trips auto-deletion bot gone forever. ""The smaller number better!!!"" -USA, part. Doesn’t OSHA require masks you’re spraying chemicals, construction like tearing concrete etc. China may care people much understand need people live. America doesnt. Serious question, impeach governor? steps? AL stay home order place - one took seriously - but, again, still aren’t - now, fighting mask ordinance implemented last week! Honestly, It’s exasperating! far worse. NYC lockdown got really bad. new places never lock down. Pretty sure report choose to. Uber enforcing picky. confining north Catalogne (Spain), Westphalia (Germany) Lisbonne region Portugal. Lots flights coming back throughout Europe. Doesn’t look good. Except also lived it. I’ve worked school, along many others. want argue anecdotal evidence bias one. Go ahead. Life experience backs already see social media.

Also, plenty people won’t admit feel way either. They’re vocal. However act kids act speaks volumes beyond anything I’ve seen social media. social media aspect part much larger picture. pretty sad depressed life would go bar etc circumstances

To desperate suggests underlying issues Natural Selection take place. sad good people can't grasp choose acknowledge science. one point, saying still case, displayed deaths day occurred day reported. might think seems logical, due reporting delays would cause always downward slope every time looked graph new deaths filling behind ever downward slope keeps moving over. graphical representation problematic. Hey: maybe told Americans virus Muslim might fear it! said proves point. media know people react easily rather give thought time someone discussion. *Shudder* seen look face told this. Sorry hear that. That's horrible. hope stay safe. 

Btw, middle-school jazz band teacher changed life lives many friends, including two friends jazz band two Best Men wedding 20 years later (alto baritone saxophones tenor sax). sad many levels. course teachers Unions near strong Police union they're going recourse. now. Exponential growth sneak reopen, hard shut back down. mean went found post thread Vegas things open there, so...clearly are. mention report collected national holiday 10k still. bad understanding they're actually emphasizing masks important subreddit likes ignore fact Freedumbs. Holy crap crowded fuck! meant Trump threw “fact” made people scramble verify went wreck something else? 

I really hope dies ASAP completely natural non-suspicious circumstances. Oh I’m sure would tons conspiracy theories, honestly spent remainder Presidency ventilator could best case scenario administration would better job running without him. bringing facts ideological poop smearing competition. sure Chicago, bar situation? Reopened? Packed? Masks? Ontario, teach personal social responsibility grade 1 course called social studies. teach children pick dirty clothes toys. clean small spills light chores. classroom, expected keep desks areas use tidy. Cleaning (disinfecting) done adults chemicals encouraged young children. learn responsibilities shared individual tasks (walking dog family responsibility), shared group tasks (tidying boots coats hallway school done teams), personal (it responsibility homework). learn different responsibilities child/son/Boy Scout/Canadian/goldfish owner, etc. California still fine. numbers crept up, they're still seeing 5% positive test rates, compared FL (20%) Arizona (25%).

CA better, unfair compare shitshow happening Southern states right now. hypothetically “political” reason coworker thinks medical experts suggesting people follow easily understandable preventative measures for? Interesting. safety precautions taken? went anxious schizophrenic pretty damn quickly tbf don’t either. people complaining anywhere else US? Salt Lake tends better general mask wearing I’ve seen. get suburbs though 🤦🏻‍♀️ I’m Jacksonville entire family still there. aren’t taking seriously all. They’ve nerve ask I’m coming visit. takes every ounce patience possess lose shit talking them. 

Also, gotta ask...are Denver? That’s true, MERS shares much less genetically SARS COVID. It’s possible highly unlikely. I’ve literally surviving food delivery since March sometimes eat straight box guess what? I’m still alive. Delivery drivers aren’t opening containers coughing food guys assume people trying earn living wage pandemic pretty fucking shitty. Idk man live city California population abt 140k I’ve going five times week last three four months friends stuff like I’ve even tested bc fever came back negative. got tested less two months ago. whole “shelter place” thing really irking don’t see threat. Maybe would lived LA something rn it’s like wtf really? Well, Government froze rent September could afford pay - even making illegal evicted suddenly lose job pandemic, providing payments / access food need it.

What Government doing? F*ck all?

The set face masks, social distance, stay inside unless absolutely necessary, businesses shut due owners either dying Covid-19 going broke long run may able keep afloat rents frozen everyone everyone locked 40 days.

Which better scenario you? I’m actually heading tomorrow two weeks vacation wakesurfing biking. I’ll crack beer ya boat. 
It’s definitely starting get big city hustle-and-bustle vibe though, miss chill little lake town. 

It’s bummer border closed I’ve yet meet anyone unhappy it, included. It’s absolutely mindblowing refuse mildly inconvenience keep others safe, basically willing sacrifice lives try keep life normal possible. 

Hopefully gets control next year come chill lake. Astros? Maybe test anyone win 'default'? That...literally answers none questions asked. Furthermore Canada isn’t even list linking, even ask...do understand “mobility” means sense? Two points don’t seem true:

Slower re-opening

Here mobility data. looks similar depth duration controversy wearing masks”
Except mask wearing 22 percent lower Canada USA

More Canadians don’t wear masks wear Obamacare isn’t great people still large copays deductibles anything routine check up.

Someone ELI5. literally said also inform people keep immune systems healthy. Not, telling us wear mask like end prevention methods Oxford vaccine still looking good, www.sciencetimes.com/amp/articles/26293/20200701/oxford-expert-claims-covid-19-vaccine-gives-long-term-immunity.htm 
""Oxford Expert Claims COVID-19 Vaccine Gives Long Term Immunity Antibodies 3X Higher Recovered Patients"". given fast disease spreading Brazil South Africa, experiments probably get enough cases proof effiecy September all. Come on, people, hang months, time go ""f**k it"" opt herd immunity. early say that. Remember MERS-CoV arose first Saudi Arabia still know exact origins. work home told school want kids online school spring. seem one parents said this, survey sent actually lot support online school, especially compared Facebook comments see. What's disturbing that's surprisingly far what's happening. Seeing Covid spreads grocery stores kills people kind suffocation/drowning. Lol special kind stupid Sunday...of holiday weekend!?! real bad. % positive rate? Eat ass friend group spent months congregating via Zoom. started hanging two three time, always outside keeping distance masks. Always away crowds. we’re 10 people, requirements. tell we’ve done anything risky, anyone isn’t comfortable coming something, don’t argue. don’t show up.

Let's face it. every part University system American huge money grab.

It little proven payoff students courses simply offered universities entice students sign sweet sweet (for universities) government guaranteed loans. point Constitutional right drink bar? right they're mainly younger people getting infected? 

That could turn okay get handle spread starts creeping parents grandparents currently catching it. “So said, slow testing down.”

-Donald Trump like facts, like reason, like science. like headlines, like words intended Successful countries 1) squashed curve 

Which curve squash alluding to? One starts high gets lower tests become widely available? That's curve metric indicates infection still spreading. curve actually squashed ACTUAL infection rate rate determined scared enough responsible enough show volunteer 2) used test&amp;trace manage outbreak clusters.

 based data provided volunteers; live, work, visited correlations outbreaks happening. work would (should) get done every positive test, matter rate is, matters collecting right data acting accordingly. continue absolutely flabbergasted Florida still issued statewide face covering directive. Yes, know 100%. virtually every study I've seen face coverings generally indicates cuts transmission fairly substantially.

You could pay go restaurant sit right now. keep running list things need home cannot ordered online, trek week list hand quickly get grocery store, always go hours.

Principals: please stop that. Deaths Houston??? topic N95s, cloth coverings. Nothing complicated either. beachfront properties elderly residents looked at..... Greenville South Carolina y’all! literally would know pandemic here. People entirely ignore it. biggest thing use gloves, second touch anything ""soiled"" (which basically everything), back point could transferring things touching phone/face/mask/kids etc.

Wearing gloves really change often clean hands, protected touch face. probably waste time money people, could actually make people think protected really are. problem, example anyway. Always Contact tracing involved requires lot man power (along side cooperative people, America’s stony suit) 

Hawaii barely managing fewest amount cases per capita. can’t imagine it’s plausible point states like Texas California Florida. ignorant claim protests issue. people wore masks, outside, still massive groups people together extended periods time. definitely spread. Yeah tons businesses able deem essential previous playtime shutdown. employers plans shutting even letting us go back work home.

I'm tired STAY HOME approach also sick people arguing wearing fucking mask. U.S. msm bad politicians many scientists shit science countries using info work SAVE LIVES. perfect science prove quantum entanglement something black holes, ground, war-time science sometimes make inference assumption using common sense cause might save thousands people.

And pooh poohing airborne studies PNAS article scientists petitioned retracted, yet see single study done MILLIONS cases U.S. Monday morning quarterbacking doctors scientists sure love MSNBC CNN checks.

Also, amazement, I've saying sort thing month now, driving wife family crazy, I'm shocked see airborne transmission getting real attention, also idea U.S. media's way disseminating information virus reactionary coverage finally taken task things I've heard light fire first even better 😁 science course . wonder people would remorse actions contract COVID-19 great numbers, Gottlieb. Breaking news: Things worse. Well, you’re admitting many parents many parents getting it. seen bars managed coronavirus? remember universities bars HUGE overlap customer base Florida still open?? could cause paralysis 1% take it, may find millions doses administered done sufficient trials. foolish may 10% us

That's generous. family coming Michigan Florida next month I'm super uncomfortable that. know none taking safety measures they're going come infect family Michigan. Converting bed space easy.

Coming additional doctors nurses quite easy.

When NY surged capacity, brought health care workers less affected areas. FL they're one fire burning amongst five ten others? Also, health care workers willing travel state whose government citizens making terrible decisions regarding masks, etc? Vail shutdown North American resorts even 24 hours issuing statement saying would not. amount money left table mid-ski season North America's biggest resorts far single Disney location.

I surprised see postpone opening. Thanks! Man I’m sorry, pretty much yesterday London pubs bars opened first time cases per 100,000 population. took log10 these. Otherwise would need huge color palette visual this. wish principal boss. [meanwhile, michigan Like biogen conference?

Yep.

So who's indoor dining? /s happy governor used science instead intimidated open prematurely people guns Twitter Dont know would help. whole problem hit hard MMA days. People complain economy needs keep running shut down. problem economy never going running people feel safe go things. People wearing masks, taking precautions, acting reckless like virus nothing hurting economy more. delaying people safely going back work making living. labs?  proof undercounting.

It's interesting Covid numbers small people say undercounted.

This started countries (China! India! Brazil! dont high body-counts .. must lying!)

And continues. Meanwhile *no* proof undercounting demonstrated. One hospital, sure.

What happens are? least partially correct, indeed go jail paying certain kinds debt Well, even ME/chronic fatigue syndrome hard doctors diagnose. Many ""victims"" claim written doctors.

I think thing ""victim mentality"" much might contribute anyone's guess.

Personally despise 'woke culture' age social media like Twitter especially, believe long term effects real. agree fever part sounds preposterous. can't see anyone run long term fever. relax. Still hurt wash hands sanitize phone on. MA, NJ, CT, NY mass protests. virus control completely point. 1.5% positive rate (with heavy testing), states similar.

Nice try dogwhistle, turns stupid keeping bars indoor stuff open spreads this, outdoor masked protesting. get 1000 cases day figure from? New York figures hundreds, fluctuating 500 700, day. New York **State**, close 20 million people. Buyouts coming Learning responsibility caring, empathetic adult society parents job school. Yes me, me, society currently probably long time.

We crazies too.

But messaging clear consistent.

Nationwide, government turned doctors said: ""This here. Tell us do."" largely done it.

Left Right, Good History Bad. matter. Doug Ford, Premier (Governor) Ontario, conservative spent term far head firmly lodged rear. push came shove, turned Chief Medical Officer province said ""Okay, tell do."" good job it.

When left leaning Federal Government announces something, Right Leaning provincial governments might offer criticism, part get board. Hell, Ford called Liberal Deputy PM (VP) hero champion live national TV day. *Excuse fuck?""

Canada enlightened political land. real divide left right. politicians country basically sat said ""We plenty time shit next year, let's get first resume slinging mud."" see customers insulting them, least. likely condescending. residents citizens border ya closed non-US residents non-US citizens since April. [Here's story.  Finland week Corona patients find statistics English Corona situation proggressed Finland. OK, seems like virus's transmissibility means discounted. rarely hear thousands people getting infected every day. percentage people wear masks try maintain social distance yet still getting infected? Okay cool, Tampa Bay 2/3 counties wear masks are. barely count manatee part Tampa bay anyway. don’t disagree all. sister teaches 1st grade really concerned going back - implications going back.

Sweden top quality reporting deaths look reported figures covid deaths. personally went [excess death whole population period death rates increased. Turned ~4500 reported die corona, excess death Sweden ~4200. really risk lot deaths missed, like opposite. Right people dying corona (on average) would died something else since we’re back normal. Yikes! people care anything wellbeing. moment thought describing trump isolated outbreak Melbourne 300 cases. They’ve locked housing 3000 people, whole thing started quarantine security guards observing protocols. 300 people one city result human error tens thousands nothing done Based username I'm getting impression climate change denier. So, discussion rational thought facts would waste time. know healthcare workers even tolerating situation point. endanger lives families State Federal officials going help stand behind them. really start resigning. began reopening 5/12, protests galore, best. Masks outdoors / social distancing work. frustrating part all. school district requiring 5day week school. know parents work tough situation plain idiotic. district wants 100% funding need 5 day school. Online kids providing 95% normally bring school funding. It’s fucking arbitrary stupid. Plus. There’s kids rigorous academic program apply choose school, get kicked get penalized staying home. Teachers don’t want go back, parents left difficult choices governor total asshat.  anything, it’s human evolution kind stopped modern advancement made easier people survive situations otherwise would died past.

Also link rounded nationwide journalism long term care home coronavirus cases ain't exactly comparable anon reddit posters.

The flu kills TENS THOUSANDS Americans EVERY YEAR! trusting data trusting interpretation data two separate things, going trend similarly long term.

I feel like people still mostly trust data, trust (the policymakers in) Sweden's interpretation comes informing strategy. uneasy tension can't last, IMHO. I’ve said many times, MEN need step up.  
The mothers need focus kids. Period.  end.  means dad get second job, it.  Granted everyone this. many can- always men willing sacrifice. circle, see mothers wanting able to

And going jail wearing mask? I’ve seen monetary fines. haven’t seen single place enforce policy jail first offense punishment mask It’s double talk, stores essential people get groceries like, bye universities places people live. false comparison you’re trying make absolutely retarded. amended article. 2 Toronto hospitals reached milestone, them. doubtful. fully recovered 2 months travelled NY CA. plus needed home family matters. wear grim reaper costume... work largest department, largest college ( quantity undergraduate students) major Florida university.

Everyone I've talked ( manegement) bassicaly idea whats happening. plan, noone seems know except high ups. 

Up untill that's fine, many weeks away supposed grand opening?

If open like nothing going on, would bet many people showing up, like me, even university ""opens"" sure hell won't. parking lots full state license plates. going living LA? so, even point precautions? Also, would smart make get tested even make trip... I'm South Florida. public everyone wears masks. next door neighbors 80's staying in. One grown daughter brings supplies. road party cars far could see. live corner technically see 2 different roads. glanced window several times see one wearing masks, everyone clumped tightly together solo cups.

The ""excess death"" number people refer is, itself, estimate. 


You would think ""counts bodies"", no. kinds interesting ideas play including ""Farrington surveillance algorithms"", ""weighting"", ""setting negative values zero"".

So end, number ""excess deaths"" spitball.

They even say math differently excess deaths would reduced example, total number excess deaths US computed directly US using Farrington algorithms approximately 25% lower number calculated summing across jurisdictions excess deaths.

And even arrive reliable ""excess death"" count, need determine many deaths actually Covid. surely ""all them"". cure common cold. doubt go away year 2. even looked study? 20 000 deaths, 120 000. saying unexplained deaths, statement wrong. many ICU beds still empty?

Makes perfect sense. think concern behaves like measels year wipes away immune systems memory, however, takes year hopefully vaccine developed. said, China yet completely proven cases (that rash reporting) reinfection number people way back November means chance reinfection would take 7+ months happen. 

Also, false antibody tests popped I'm sure one case somebody tested positive antibodies covid test bad later caught covid. 

There definitely known evidence currently supporting reinfection though. didn’t die covid then. originally ended Florida due mass migration NY, Ohio, states Polk county developed. much swing state probably blue election. roommate drank bunch 151 set bunch cotton balls soaked fire bathroom sink, test flammable actually is...yes, flammable, lol. thought design crazy.

That’s giant, scary “if”.  would disagree. I’ve unfortunately watched hours hours live-streams. I’d say 30% people wearing correctly. Remember, hanging ear isn’t correct, nose chin isn’t correct..... it’s never ok innocent people killed anyone. you’re willing keep stores open despite COVID fears heaven forbid universities try?

Nah. say someone who's industry come back Covid dealt honestly overwhelm healthcare systems wait vaccine. could take long time think there's 'normal' happens. curious know peaks stays level? wish healthcare workers would mass walkout demand state shutdown. absurd. look like funhouse? place get news. want fun, go somewhere else. problem USA. middle class eroding. system making rich richer richer faster faster, growing underclass forming bottom.

15 dollars net hour average income here, course pay university fees health insurance money.

There minimum wage country, lowest wages 6 dollars net per hour (farm workers). cleaner someone McDonalds earns 8 dollars net per hour. Prices 1-room apartments (about 30m² size) 400 800 dollars, including utilities.

13 dollars hour would bad - normal middle class salary, 4 days vacation per year bad joke.

The good thing legal regulations vacation, 5 weeks plus 13 holidays, paid. work holiday (e.g. nurse, policeman...), get 50% extra pay. even get extra month's pay vacation finance nice vacation. required law everyone. addition, sick leave continue receive normal salary healthy again, become unemployed continue receive large part salary find job again. Okay? Maybe running business computers. mean knows politics anything pandemics. Yeah get it. First never came said protests cause spread. ridiculous statement immediately makes everyone go wtf. could easily said still looking data expect spread occurred believe minimal given blah blah blah .... whatever. least point immediately set fail called it. 

I sure probably thinking 'didn't guy say answers like shitty?"" Yes, yes did. say answers like shitty mean coming scientists drs. Imagine told doctor ""some people definitely die condition"". ""A death sentence immunocompromised 60 year old unwittingly passed bus contracting club.""

There. Fixed you. Countries started admit numbers juiced.

Only matter time US found link says, negative health affects lockdown felt years come.

Lockdown hysterics fucking ghouls. Right? stupid equate move save lives literal death camps. What’s worst case scenario bad vaccine? Death? Wouldn’t see limited animal/human trials? 

At rate would 50% effective vaccine worth pushing out? Sorry don’t know much vaccines work, vaccine worked half population half get get cold/fever wouldn’t still worth it? rookie numbers.

US going herd ~~immu~~ extinction strategy Meanwhile PPP loan sits bank waiting use pay laid employees.... January 2024? week ten days areas. depends test lab used. course much quicker. Maybe rely slave labor?! 

For real though, state get enough funds fire support pull funds forest service could used wildfire mitigation. vicious cycle. forget city said it, warned would overwhelmed two weeks. four days later hospitals overwhelmed. go, hope learn stop gross racist :) knew relying slave labor would come back haunt us? kids see hope future country, healthcare education situation ,and viable way immigrate different first world country.

I handle well enough myself, that's it. One real tragedies people idea behind closed doors, see someone I'll ventilate slowly drown transudate seeping lungs, would doubt severity Illness second.

People doubt denial, see, understand reality is. No, we're not. Lol well ***/s*** intent, implications, tone; necessarily denying points. I, one, welcome wish visit immigrate Canada open arms. course current pandemic forces exception, made us implement rational evidence-based travel restrictions lessen spread. buses always seem pretty full... don’t know would ever hear cases internal outbreak. know students primary job Canada US learn. culture people job clean up. Trying mandate classroom cleaning would go believe sound like fun guy. Get reporting champ. Even conservative college (in Boston, it’s still pretty conservative) gonna ask every student wear mask

It’s oxymoron college science department ask students wear masks lol repair services factories? Veterinarians? still treatments, yes, either body fights wins, doesn't. That's recovery hospitals take long, making sure fight long can. continue family get togethers/parties hospitals fill near collapse stupid selfish, I’m sorry.

Again, asking people weekly BBQs asking people solitary confinement. seems like Americans can't imagine way in-person socializing involve parties big groups. I'm talking people meeting people taking safety measures, that's point social bubble. lockdown cities Spain good example, people allowed commune others groups 10. Singaporeans, part restrictions allowed maximum 5 guests home one time. UK, people living allowed join households choose. people told take reasonable precautions, people abide. 

The fact willing make exemption single-person households proof completely misunderstood argument. Bodies refrigerated trailers? 0 tests = 0 cases.

• AC non-recirculating. 
• Time-in-vehicle 7+ hours. 
• Son shows symptoms, tested.

How low risk? extended time-in-vehicle concerns me. far I, European, understand US politics, makes less likely efforts contain pandemic. healthcare workers walk out? should. Oh really? don’t live anymore haven’t paid close attention. What’s situation like days? guys reopening? Proning? Dexamethasone? Toculizumab (possibly)? Outdoors? That’s poor argument makes sense completely disregard current data.

Cases spiking across country 6 weeks difference daily new deaths.

Are saying 6 weeks isn’t long enough? offending businesses. post said employee take pic customer give OSHA. OSHA can't anything that. most, business that's reporting would get shit on. seen mask wearing anti-mask protests, huge majority people police protests wearing masks I've seen.

It sure great time protest, also never good time cops kill people. ok seems like agreeing essential workers get medical treatment covid. gonna anything.

The government care, 100% close schools give stim check. Intubated sedated win lol  National strategy. everyone gets we’re good year so. Murphy done great job imo. I’m getting g really frustrated reading hate he’s getting nj residents complaining he’s handling response here. many idiots crying taking rights away mandating mask. expect increase cases though casinos opening along amusement parks stuff whole idea slow spread, stopping it. sure stopping even possible really scary. don’t know hospital works uncle going break 4th July weekend family called help out. It’s really scary Sloth. socially distancing death use wipes without scrubbing things soap water first? would love able one other. lots postdocs workplace. can’t leave country won’t able re-enter H1B. also lots H1B hired year starting yet due immigration travel hold. would say employees area work Americans - it’s sort niche area. Thank you. We're going need you, unfortunately. Takes 14 days average current infections hit hospitals. get tough.
Wear masks. America rich nation. oligarchy rich suck poor loan money buy phones/TVs keep placated. need capture study man want us stop, call state Rep demand police reform. Otherwise, we’ll see soon city near you!  7 whistleblowers china died disappeared knew bad. Fuck dumb shit took months studying figure out. “Questions raised”? Ok clickmaster two weeks since cases started surging deaths still down. could 200 today. tell me? Maybe they'll go slightly trending way right now. Welp, think may signed life away working another 2 months LA hospital. 

I cant wait fun :( “Anyone complaining government response gets comment deleted”?!?! People read comments EVERY SINGLE THREAD SUBREDDIT see comment laughable. I’m actually astounded someone would even attempt make it. wow. course, several millions may survive lifelong consequences dont know guys. went bar day wasnt bad.

/s  Tell something don’t already know. Well live work Tokyo, avoid large crowds real option. ride subway. Yep..why feel bad human garbage?  Considering US, well countries, consistently failed testing, contact tracing, informing properly, STILL failing concerning mask use. say obvious especially known. need written simply, large font, screamed fucking mountaintops reach Everyman Joe, he’s fucking failure this. Hallway, likely. Uber terrible company run people lacking moral fiber. dont quite understand sentiment. fact shutdown even attempted demonstrate potential virus posed scared enough people top shitless enough enact shutdown.
People ages getting sick, almost genetic lottery bad affects someone. recover got back 100 %, may not.
 Hospitals filling up. Family's wants healthcare workers teachers quit working.  pillars normal society built could crumble.
We need focus containment, tracing, keeping people homes (by mean stopping eviction foreclosures), potential vaccine development. I’m inpatient pharmacy. actually compounded first ever dose remdesivir entire health system. 2 weeks ago 10 planets 4 explain? haven’t following. leader know general public capable right thing situations like these. Even right rules consequences place fair amount people still dumb shit, different anything else. No. believe existing Vitamin blood test may valid Africans. evidence evolutionary forces shaped them, physiology efficient utilizing vitamin D. It’s study clearly didn’t read. !remindme 2 weeks smart, knowing know. 

You Remind year, loser. 

It must fun going life wait someone tell want know. wont. keep forced stop sickness death. then, month turns next, year next, going exact thing spanish flu pandemic. going forget happened noone likes reminded actions caused demise others love. did. Unfortunately 99.93% USA didn’t get memo back then. 

With mass media finally reporting it, hopefully serve wake call many rethink day-to-day activities. hope. (a small southern European country) masks mandatory stores, national law. tried enter store without mask, security would stop (larger stores) would served would asked leave (smaller stores). shame called would enough make comply.

If leave police would called, would make leave, would arrest necessary. crime low every construction site (accessing road) every jewelry store policeman standing outside - need it, give police something do. Arresting someone wearing mask would highlight week. Haha nah pretty safe. Gators sharks want mess people, 99% time anyway. Lol sounds nice, yeah, still people's fault. ruining anything. Anyone halfway paying attention aware everything written. Voter turnout dropping also peoples' fault.

At end day, people still allow everything written happen. state make harder them? Yes. large scale protests things written. 

By way, live Republic, Democracy. willing believe misspoke first comment, seems didn't. yet 30 seconds scrolling I've seen asked three times. really makes puzzled even kind circumstances, still insist number reported China unreal.
Does matter? Imagine hookup/one night stand saying something similar. care wear condom.... Filed mail 2/23, got return 6/24 lol clear, example, serious time lag reporting cases deaths - deaths particular. might seem like small things you. isn't.

So basically made unsubstantiated claims, supported ""your"" observations. 


You cannot answer almost non-existing excess deaths. cannot answer "" source Sweden's ""very serious time lag"" compared countries? "" 


IMO high quality information. ever say negated them? compare typical death rates? states using way look good.

“Oh still 30% ICU beds available statewide.”

While conveniently neglecting mention beds rural hospitals outside hotspots hospitals hotspots ran out. fucked economy fuck would us do? Quit jobs become homeless without healthcare? dumb response.  dumb Steve Doocy. Europe, UK imo  horrifying. pray moms everyone else's moms make it. actually force them? 
Who's going pay cost hotels, food, lost pay, lost job One thing I've wondering whether body's harmful immune response happens even encounters disabled viral particles, that's even thing. in, test negative, virus still body dormant dead state. Then, immune system notices it, reacts strongly. I’m Georgia band teacher (only third year.) excited start teaching music - it’s dream like 10 years. I’m finally here, feel like life, coworkers lives, students’/their families’ lives aren’t valued. told don’t like it, take “leave absence” (lose job.) Feels like I’m forced give dream I’ve gotten started, risk mine everyone’s safety. assume putting eggs one basket case one proves work. massive benefits one first countries mass-immunise, economy fully open up, large scale events, also world opens citizens travel.

Not everything Trump. Cases probably rise things reopen, necessarily define failure. well would cases mortality kept low enough level strain healthcare system. time being, majority people NYC still masked public (I estimate 75-95% depending neighborhood) helps people keep up. Correct, though Corona real, overblown, ty, yes, everybody Lamestream media.Sometimes even friends Fox, mostly DNN MSDNC. instead insisting people shutting again, stop intruding people’s livelihoods let want. everyone needs quarantined real problem reacting cases statistic people don’t realistic idea even means. 

You’re correct 10k 30s get Covid you’ll handful deaths... 10k 80 year olds get Covid you’ll 1k deaths.

So protecting elderly, age population positive cases? don’t know 10k cases doesn’t mean much anything can’t really predict outcome all.

People post stuff react alarmist simplistic ways. one liner twitter culture work. Critical thinking may take time consideration people don’t time that.

The fact media complicit sensationalist reporting makes people irrationally fearful / judgmental people distrustful information general. reason confederate pride considered completely American. morals corrupt, weve corrupted deaf cries corrupt system crushes sake prosperity leisure. Yeah, happy make 16 year old cry, long dont see hear it, exist. Yeah family also convinced it’s end times. However, don’t buy western escapism philosophy pre-tribulation rapture. mother concerned inflation anything added another 100 chickens farm self sufficient.  plan top down. Idiots running country Really? idea!!! RGV Texas majority Hispanic area. state federal government ain’t gonna shit. That's get even deadly pandemic becomes political football. Oh propaganda around long time. technology allows us truly home individuals study outcome using complex Data Intelligence.

Unfortunately people idiots also equal vote :(

I think 1 person incharge. joint regulations body like ones newspapers set fund ensure conduct way that's honourable, factual fair. true would deep shit still Europe likely facing kind apocalyptic nightmare scenario. issue LOT money required (potentially hiring far teachers cover smaller class sizes make sure remote aspect covered also) make viable (that's even discussing safety protocols, PPE provisions etc). talk additional budget cuts, teachers lot experience familiar lack follow even basic health protocols (the classic soap bathrooms etc)., realize issues lie. Many things fundamental parts social structure/systems long periods time need change benefit all, think schools dramatically re-thought/re-shaped. Ideally. maybe half-baked dangerous plans go effect August see fall out. much ""they're over-reporting COVID deaths get funding!"" Good question! definitely see former big factor well. Less severe symptoms might mean people could still participate day day activities / isolate lead transmission too! Thank read different comments lately pneumonia deaths way US 2020 (presumably related Covid-19) wondering sources data would viewable updated, hourly, daily weekly, similar Coronaboard? people see end? get frustrated sad listening leadership starting top President say over, won, it'll disappear, he's credited great job. messaging politicises wearing mask, leaves seeing end sight. Even Biden wins November still months go election fear might late. $600 weekly UI ends really see shit hit fan IMO. 

In mind still beginning I'm confident ever sentiment seeing easily outbreaks happening country. 

I live we've handled well people listen educate seeing selfish, ignorant, entitled people feel virus makes sick. First confirmed death. knows real first death was. Tell secondary schools still planning return business usual Fall. mean hospitals left, always take patient hospital neighboring county. fails, Orland Jacksonville, go down, it’s time ship people Tampa. Plenty states rooms hospitals. long whole country doesn’t get fucked up, ok right? Guarantee can. 1.4b people there. That's less one percent plus Fearon government disobey.

We small population (525k whole province 92% living island). Roughly half people live eastern part island. cases early March outbreak funeral home dozens people tested positive. sudden too, hard get people comply.

Also, live St. John's, 76cm snow (~3 feet) one day back January, stay home order week back cleared away snow. like weird dress rehearsal rest 2020. Could provide link? people aware sure would wear mask social distancing lot better. likely due people color needed sunshine produce adequate Vitamin levels. sneeze grocery shopping last week, think sanitary alternative, sneezed mask...it definitely kinda gross lol

But also gross expecting? No. It’s going beach isn’t right. It’s context activity matters. Protesting beaches closed would fine. hanging beach not. Weekends normally lower counts Florida. fact still high means Monday much higher dare go redditsphere politics? say need eat rich, get upvoted move on! H1N1 flu pandemic US: dumb stupid approach battling pandemic.


You loose ""war"", idiots. Hey, since seem date, reference guide explaining long people contagious sick?  
   
PS: feel you, people seem grasp idea feel healthy infected contagious two weeks. makes disease easy spread. long expected rise daily deaths? far rather flat. Could people low risk groups getting virus resulting death? Arrested =\= thrown jail 

It says articles escalation fines potential jail time 

None state anyone done actual jail time 

And don’t really much problem people arrested non compliance, it’s incredibly easy thing comply aimed increasing everyone’s safety !Remind 10 days Right. icu beds must filled mannequins then. Give convenience give death. thanks :3 even think that! There's many ways people unsafely co-mingling focusing beach relatively safe basically shoving head sand. mean they're fatter Americans biggest metropolis dirt poor air quality significant altitude.

It sounds like disaster me. propose media stop reporting things happening ""two weeks away"". tell us actually happens. I’m connected Shenzhen China every kid teacher required wear mask, p.e, canceled, hall walking, school sanitized multiple times day/week. 

A good model start first wave finishes. wave.... doomed. long expected rise daily deaths? far rather flat. Could people low risk groups getting virus resulting death? plan dealing pandemic...wonder happened it. saying hoax February lol agree everything except ""Mothers need able fully dedicate children."" Fathers, caregivers child's life also obligation. mother's sole undertaking. way written puts effort mother. That's wrong mindset what's kept careers equal pay difficult women. work tourist attraction Panama City, literally carnival here. I’d say people wearing masks. 30% I’d say 15% wearing properly entire time inside. employees required wear masks. absolutely insane, served around 500 people yesterday pretty slow day considering 4th July. Today, nearing 300 people it’s lunch time Isn’t Uber forcing drivers sign virtual waiver request ride saying accept condition wear mask? might’ve dreamed that. many questions regarding crab would dropping (indicating original climb height part crab, even stranger *descent* part height crab would droppable) 

And similar go camping come across Moose, aka elephants Canadian forest: ignore move along. Oh, comment agreeing adding context. mean alcohol causes people take fewer precautions? astounding! needs investigated further! Yes studies.

What country, region, even hospital tracking reporting clinical level? went get together park. started social distancing got drunk went window second. Yet there's Defense Production Act utilized increase PPE stocks despite repeated suggestions so. funny thing is, area, kids sleepovers parties anyway....they literally stopped hanging ALL.. hopefully going get next 8 weeks move on. US showing exponential growth yet, doubling rate slow exponential. Damn, someone beat it. regards triggered.. clue it'd help. I'm trying find ways make money. Also teacher. whole “no masks schools” thing baffling. Especially pushing masks everywhere else. Many receive Houston right helps Isn’t using binary term define problem? It’s two.

Most “airborne” diseases persistent travel further. “droplet” diseases less persistent travel difficulty.

This Coronavirus middle range broken two categories early medical science. hadn’t pressing need refine this... till now.

The viral load required infection exact persistence virus outside body know likely broad spectrum answers depending conditions. We, unfortunately, pleanty empirical evidence pull point. 

Wear masks. helps. know that.
Better masks help more, much used entirely correctly.

Dilution virus air - outside spread apart - cuts risk way down.

If possible, tolerate around someone coughing sneezing, without covering. wearing face covering protect wearing mask even napkin face significantly nothing. days ago article ""confirming"" asymptomatic people still transmit virus commented saying pretty sure known since least March Feb got torn countries fighting aware, since commenters' countries say anything never believed it.

The lack trust science days genuinely concerning probably one reasons we'll wipe natural disaster climate change thats went wrong; avoiding dad jokes.

I’m 51 young retire old quit find financially equivalent job. don’t choice I’ll return August try careful possible  calling Super Saturday almost goading people go get wasted. close friend developed symptoms evening June 26 became Pronounced June 27. got tested Monday June 29 first thing morning. still results. upset behalf, shared car ride several hours 27th (first time broke quarantine). doctor agree likely exposed test positive urged soon get tested since likelihood false negative likely 8 days. Anyway, can’t believe it’s week doesn’t results. never happen. 

The person -- use term loosely -- could crisis want hear deal again. cares trying rile base enough get re-elected.

January 21st could happen. Depending situation like US time. happen then. California executed death row inmate since 2006, out-of-control COVID-19 outbreak San Quentin State Prison may contributed death fifth condemned inmate date, 1,300 prisoners 120 staff members tested positive COVID-19 state prison Marin County. Among fallen victims deadly illness San Quentin’s aging population death row. Turns magic spell social distancing along. stay fuck away virus infect you. Simple enough! US deaths make significant number deaths. US isn’t fully reporting holiday weekend, course deaths go down. Fortunately enough 60% us population get shot order R value go 1. Problem vaccines 100% effective, therefore I’m assuming least 70% people need it. think government gonna make life harder people aren’t vaccinated (travel restrictions, school restrictions etc.) ...6-10 pic clearwater beach notice use telephoto compress space people close together might think. live near popular beach, even crowded (and pandemic) people try keep apart, one wants top other. Glad isnt me. worried pulled Homer missed mailbox. cohesive response. Every state went fight shores virus war leader. post Trump denying seriousness virus still waiting moderation, unrelated clickbait allowed. Oh shit, first I've heard it. Good golly gosh, breaking news. Ah yes, lets send kids go infect entire family, killing many parents/grandparents without planning go hard lock places did. going way worse. Adults long even get headline. fucked. Friday pub Sunday Grandma I'm lost words know give fuck hits home friends/immediate family members. Arrest cops killed Breona Taylor. going kill US universities. least insanely high fees. scam overcharging 4 year degree finally coming close... Honestly even like articles comparing two, continue fuel link people mis-remember posts like these.

This Pandemic, SARS2.

If compare anything, compare SARS. wrong. Say 100 times still ignorant wrong. teacher. understand implications children (my kids kids teach) school. heartbreaking. But... go back classroom least need reassurance adequate PPE cleaning supplies. Reduced class sizes. Mandatory face masks everyone staff. teach middle school. 11-14 year olds perfectly capable wearing mask, can't, enroll virtual learning option. shift ""Flatten curve allow hospitals handle load"" ""Keep everything closed cure""?

Flattening curve requires consistent effort everybody set period time. multiple attempts became apparent us capable everybody else going YOLO thing started looking ourselves. Back March people saying thing “in two weeks two weeks that.” Looks like took 4 months us see catastrophic levels. It’s also way sub tries get message across. outside perspective looks like get hard cases start surge well look added nearly 200 ICU's \*based free ICU's went yesterday 120, icu increases like 80 140 that. Colleges: person win win. get full tuition students, save huge amount pensions! slightly unrelated note, live Canada little concept dangers present local waters aside I've fed salacious news stories involving small children preferred target maligned suburban aligators........however....

Kayaking mangroves....is dangerous? thing large prehistoric creature could potentially lunge take arm? asking sheer curiosity. know authorities that. mean, gaining? like correct information hard come by. Surely CDC Interwebs. They're often going grain give old bad information - information often belies common sense. wouldnt want take family place huge increase cases well limited medical space. Plus lot people refuse wear mask. Wearing mask keep people safe yourself. would bringing family place lot people essentially saying fuck health. Source? Care hazard guess why? good advice people could ""if really, really want gather, least outdoors"". might curb amount infections statistically, could advice people actually somewhat would comply to. nice outside anyway, summer. harness effect summer. much option anymore winter. Article mention many ICU patients Covid related insisting protesting despite risk COVID, sending strong message lives people highest risk virus don’t matter. doesnt benefit China. think everyone quarantine social distance vaccine?
Why percent people risk.

What mean try rest developed word did? Well mean, wrong. people can't breathe without mechanical aid regardless, whether mask not.

But nearly everybody, literally nearly everybody, able breathe bit cloth face. rest, vent largely gives away mask going awkward insert. sub cancer exact reason stated. need real discussions sustainable best practices. Even crowded beach relatively safe space. Yes wether agree subs sentiment not. almost always accepted opinion anything else downvoted Oblivion.

My important conversations rarely seen trying change minds get downvoted. sir wrong. STOP. Coming soon town near you! want us stop? Call congressman demand police reform right now. Otherwise, good luck. explain [Taiwan People wore masks without told authorities:

""On 8 February, Chen Shih-chung, commander Central Epidemic Prevention Center, said need wear mask public transportation. caused storm protest"". I've opted virtual fall kids well. I'll still go work (at school), least worry safety. Because, yes, kids cough others funny aggressive. thank that. Criminal Justice first tried online, got F took person got A, like night day.

Asking better inform myself, dick. Operation fuck young people. Hi back. Anything happened? No? lmao. now? not? fuck it! Please please please come Tampa Bay right now. Please stay home. Given India's population poor man:land ratio matter time became #1.

I think done well contain far.

If China's suppression facts would far ahead. believe zero cases China even minute. long. 

Our rampant anti-intellectualism disdain science caused us deny anthropogenic climate change decades. blatantly ignored medical experts scientists regarding pandemic experience horrifying situation hospitals fill up.

I keep going country lags behind First World nations nearly every caregory, ranging healthcare, education, public services, quality life, etc. photo notwithstanding, prevalent mask usage Malaysia? Governments shit-hole countries misclassify fact ""Bad"" political speech time Barely anyone country wears masks (Denmark) George Soros must YUGE roster crisis actors... stop testing want get control virus go skin, unless switch gloves/wash hands *with* gloves, might well use them. 

It better wash hands often. primary cause death? agree. fucking nuts medical professional spout nonsense Visual aid see far breath actually travels. Truthfully don’t entirely disagree stage. I’m layman. can’t really say consequences would haven’t really seen modelling idea. Ok well agree probably needed lockdown upon blindsided first wave March April curve flattened manageable things alone (pending citizen compliance course) realized half-hearted ""suggestions"" ""guidelines"" going followed curve flattening many states absolutely erased month re-opening. studies suggesting transmitted mostly cells nose. protecting wrong hole wear masks like that, honestly, know people think look cool wearing mask like that. biased, wear mask like front me, I'll think dork. &amp;#x200B;

This originally published March second actual study read (can't find first) reports China Iran (this would Italy getting number online ""debates"" people pointing CDC guidelines frustrating. matter study paper point (most scientifically illiterate understand papers anyway - seriously) sink in.

This critical political leaders give consistent backing scientists US screwed. Canadian, border Detroit. last thing American ever follow Canada does. tell American do. USA almost 3 million, 100k. Yes, 10th population spread still pretty good. Population Ontario 14.5 million, Michigan 10. Michigan 72k cases/ 6k dead. Ontario 35k cases 270 dead. something right here. saved lives messengers god, imams popes combined. You’re downvoted don’t know someone facebook told mind control device. dont know believe 100% correct, it’ll magically disappear never life county hospital resorted using freezer trucks store dead patients. also shortage people saying vulnerable need isolate young healthy move on.  

I’m saying that’s right, big voices supporting idea it’s shocking people follow suggestion. Nothing? public restrooms? drive stop gas, groceries, beer, pee break? lack social distancing groups people playing frisbee? even things? ""Professor, without knowing precisely danger is, would say time viewers crack others heads open feast goo inside?""

""Yes would Kent"" t-shirt. driving around downtown marveling everything closed. think disturbing did, told her: ""At least things closed pandemic, bombing raids. Could worse."" money it’s kind leaking point return. really wish could filter entire internet feed excluded anything relating fool Even true, we're people saying deaths would surely surge. incorrect prediction still incorrect prediction pro teams leagues players worried about. risk athletic 20-30 somethings zero. *can* become seriously ill, unknown consequences. 

Now Braves one keystone players ""worst flu life"" thing hoping get worse. Cases keep going deaths keep going down. US set another record low yesterday (I know know it’s weekend like people said last ten weekends). cases going figure deaths start creep back point soon extended family vacationing someone learned tested positive later on. 

I work two exposed constantly. Obviously I'll take precautions I'm wondering get tested. qualify. wait week? false information. Shall call hoax? Airborne transmission notified February. Different countries acted like based information. Ya brain, heart, liver, kidneys, lungs and, (dramatic pause) dick. Wear mask. This. I'm paranoid one, stay home, wear mask etc, analyze every single news jumping conclusion.

Wait read article panicking. meantime, wear masks. keep getting downvoted saying no. article clarifying something headline suggests click bait? really? Truly ""Airborne"" vs micro droplets vapor linger air long time? Correct? wonder, one lives hot dry climate vs humid one, think would make kind difference long infected micro droplet sits air? Makes wonder hot dry countries areas vs tropical ones climes might help along end life micro droplet.. Oh, irony...

Technically, one throwing *ad hominems* around. dip due decreased tests weekend national holiday... many previous weekends. It’s weird people issue wearing masks yet people taught covering mouth sneeze/cough polite hygienic people. Well goddamn shit. pandemic space issues always broken sloppy drunk person. three year degree Australia, nothing. sure guy burn country world get way. ultimate temper tantrum Maybe someone knew. medical organizations repeating droplet spread *not airborne*. led lot wrong conclusions do, useful masks are, example. mean virus spread cruises? One point, least area (AZ) hospitalized folks since started seeing surge younger, mainly 18-50. Presumably folks bars, maybe protests people masked. still lethal elderly folks (not young people vulnerable course). 

I know totally good thing folks recover might lead people dropping guard. Although IMO people share facebook stories awful was, they're still sick 3 weeks later, probably lot weight news media report. least social group seems taking precautions point really laying low. teacher Spain get admin job year? Perhaps relevant, story two infected hairdressers pass 140 clients - everyone wearing oh gawd, another 4 years JT please. guy wants make ashamed hetero white person. thing country going resources can't monetize that. employer using justification -- open plan office thousands work open tables -- putting ""sneeze guards"" go eye height sides desks nothing front. ""Your monitors block."" issued us Lysol wipes keep droplets desks keep reassuring us common surfaces cleaned time. Masks mandatory sit 5 feet other. I've wearing mask people area still working home, full staff expected back office end month. outbreak hits, it'll like wildfire drought. Um... pointed anecdotal may reflective what's needed possible across board. Guess “we” referring people pay attention. Princeton University releases study March stating aerosolized trouble it’s cultural UK. inhibited emotionally alcohol pubs social crutch. 

Other European nations reopened cafes, restaurants bars people respect social distancing drink moderation. parent right. data far indicate acquired immunity fades months. Probably 100%, enough covid-19 disease get once, like chicken pox.

This consistent types coronavirus cause ""common cold"" symptoms humans. science back up? Unfortunately that's interpreted. know reminds of? /r/tropicalweather big one “supposed” hit MLS thing. bunch players getting sick said wear mask unless sick treating someone sick June. Cotton also poor medium retains moisture. cotton mask gets moist pretty quickly it’s wet whatever hits outside migrate inner surface easily. Ever seen tree significantly reduces wind? could happen molecules air clearly get leaves?

Just something theoretically get barrier mean barrier useless. mask stop every single particle getting nothing. people even bother use brain? Well, US dumb 40k testing positive day. Almost impossible enforce quarantine many people without locking camp people arguing semantics. virus was(still is) detectable air 3hrs. Maybe stays droplets that's long droplets stay airborne. point still seems like airborne spread 3 hours long time.

Maybe fit official definition. change serious take precautions necessary. Psst touch face.

;) actually varies state many states isn’t official minimum (although try toddler I’m sure CPS won’t happy). It’s quite dependent child responsible 12 year old feel comfortable leaving home times, feel comfortable leaving home 40 hours week expecting motivate school work. That’s proposition fails me. *any* states good, constant leadership pandemic? Alaskan Senator seems like Alaska good. looking comment. Grew SoCal living coastal FL. mountain/hill found around parts. CA camping open around me. Packed less dead? Dont feel bad NJ shore packed elbow elbow weekend. comment short-sighted thinking messaging give people doctors treating it. point I've since conceded. know true overall

But let spread around anyway.

And social media going death us. That’s problem people stay inside there’s compilation video Italian mayors throwing fits YouTube. 
 What?


I'm trying understand value think adding discussion? kindergarten ""Greek-sounding"" name make concerned? Why? wish university work wouldn’t open. It’s going nightmare. want quarentine dorms. going towards responsible that? I'm pretty sure living Florida means super extra fucked covid top POS guy. stayed indoors waited several weeks tested negative.  American mindset. Selfish Teachers, waiters, type work needs human interaction manipulates contaminated material spaces public transport, street cleaners, housekeeping, hospital cleaners really fucked Breaking quarantine Romania could mean prison, one contacts dies. But, nevertheless, testing contacts household infections, numbers don’t appear daily toll. 
Also, people lost fucking mind don’t believe existence virus. great job flattening curve start epidemic, became political. now, it’s matter time catch it. Great, great. feel like lots semantics going on, I’m okay using terms aerosol gets people serious disease without causing panic. Aerosol technically droplets, ones hang air longer. 

Also, basing findings empirical evidence, deductive evidence, microbiological evidence? seems like it’s deductive evidence; evidence there’s way infection could spread unless aerosolized. I’m saying bad way support claim, scientists legitimate models diagnose way. I’d curious see empirical (evidence actually happening controlled environment) microbiological (showing structure COVID-19 prone airborne transmission) evidence. Absolutely Russia, China, Syria, Yemen faced standards. may sound unreal it’s something that’s evident ratio 1:10 news articles, op Ed’s forums dedicated proving Israel monster among us. you’re real conversation, that’s heart I’m saying people like fed hullshit. Israel held unrealistic standard given location history. yet given it’s location it’s climate is. one hundred percent believe much earlier government states. coworker different division fell ill flu like symptoms. previously cancer susceptible bad illness; put hospital unable breathe, went 50-75-100 percent ventilator matter days. ventilator something like 2 months airlifted much better hospital within hours breathing own. 

That happened January travelled anywhere, especially outside country. keep contact I'd bet he'd test positive antibodies. right showed serious be. We've others test positive division fine, healthy individuals. Sweden elementary schools open time. Despite high infection rates, teachers got sick. overwhelming evidence kids spread virus much adults much less spread viruses like influenza. article clarifies headline suggests it. click bait quality it. Yeah! see stat? Texas alone? No, rush bars despite pandemic complain loudly. dont' criticize poor, impulse control, poor judgement, generally foolish.

I think chose one part wrote, immediately clutched pearls, pulled fainting couch really way respond ham fist argument something strays actual point made. Founders hold truths self-evident, men created equal, endowed Creator certain unalienable Rights, among Life, Liberty pursuit Happiness.

In case you’ve never read it:

 0.6% estimate saw couple weeks ago factoring asymptomatic cases understand Imagine exhausted death alarming rise cases. go home turn tv see thousands people hanging masks 4th July. What’s point? less dead? strongly people following guidelines social distancing? Nobody said masks would absolutely prevent spread, would significantly cut risk also preventive measures.

Those measures include spending significant time enclosed areas recycled air circulation. definition airborne clarified. No, doesn't. CoVid causes extreme problems less 1 1000 get remember estimating every 1 person found infected today, 20+ going 'under radar' symptoms mild even get tested.

That coming straight doctor, Steven Pondek, Maryland uber-Blood actually exact opposite. life, point? live rural area plenty white folks shortage crime elicit activity, particularly drug abuse prove self quarantine entering entering? Wife taking seriously type one diabetic underlying conditions, looking houses online nova scotia saw wed love check upcoming october. go this.. wanted say.... He'll SOOOOOOO behind tho. Smart kid, get wrong, neither wife resources proper at-home schooling highly air conditioned country.

Europe country. fucked things took feel hopeful? protestors selfish assholes. sucks you’re allowed say without called bigot whatever. People least stay consistent condemnations. health secrretary said people acted responsibly bars opened last night

But London lol work HVAC controls mild climate, new buildings typically require economizer air handling units. would easy change setpoints force 100% OSA many cases.

The trouble “only aerosol generating procedure” recommendation it’s completely bogus. well documented events create aerosols include sneezing, coughing, shouting, singing, breathing heavily, burping, vomiting, yawning. know influenza data. predict patient going these? Answer: can’t. actual safe way handle literally always wear respirator, powers know know isn’t enough supply keep recommendation.

Being outside brief amounts contact certainly lower risk brief amounts contact *inside...* still risk. Schools set open mid august California. We’re currently seeing spike cases. plan involves kids wear masks entire time, temperature checks, social distancing. 

So doesn’t account asymptotic cases. Parents going sit around wait knows long kid stands line. schools budgets slashed decades resulting increasingly larger class sizes. 24-30 kids per class common here, suddenly they’re going find way properly distance them?

Hmm, maybe past criminals years experience working firefighters pennies offered actual jobs they're released problem. world population 7,795,979,000. number people killed COVID-19 528,000. means, approximately 0.006% world killed COVID-19.

What would happen 1% world killed (\~80m deaths)?

What would happen 50% world killed (\~3.4b deaths)?

Could humans still survive long-term? tipping point deaths would put humans risk extinction? many people would need die humans considered endangered species?

In worst case scenario, zero social distancing, vaccine, ""life usual"" many crowds life 2018, many deaths would expect year year? maximum potential death possible?

I looked Spanish Flu found that: estimated 500 million people one-third world’s population became infected virus. number deaths estimated least 50 million worldwide.

So 1/10th 1/3rd 1/30th world's population. COVID-19 bad Spanish Flu kills 1/30th 7.8 billion people, that's 260 million deaths.

It feels like we're still long ways becoming tragedy scale Spanish Flu, also we're still long ways becoming human extinction event. Even worst case scenario, seems like humans survive species anyways.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I’d like paid “expert” well stating totally obvious  CDC fine. worked great 2000-2016 dealt big challenges time.

the problem CDC right Executive branch thinks every agency serves interests Legislative branch allows it. Executive branch cut funding since 2016 dictated CDC downplay it. people charge CDC follow direction Executive branch would replaced, since that's exactly happened every agency.

with change Executive Legislative leadership CDC would fine. dismantling completely unnecessary. breeding grounds? already local area! hell decided part reopening, outdoor concerts masks social distancing safe? rather, paid look way? distinction presymptomatic asymptomatic. Apparently truly asymptomatic people rarely spread virus, people presymptomatic do, can't tell one days weeks. Best treat though presymptomatic, especially people get show symptoms eventually. want say gloves next useless people know use them, marginally better proper hand hygiene touching face/mask do. virus airborne, droplet spread, meaning survive HVAC filtering systems masks work.  Much danger, think, subsided. many opposing forces mixed uprising, including infiltrators etc..Now demonstrations smaller, safer peaceful protests possible (no looting confuse issues). demonstrations safer baseball make present--and sometimes is. 10 million investments crash. stupid hicks think wearing mask taking away rights show evidence ventilators first I'm hearing helpful. think cultural crisis unless culture disregard medicine guess describes states pretty well rest world quarantining vaccine. official policy anywhere, except demagogy. 

What countries simply trying keep numbers control. Imagine backup hospital sent *in network.* 🤦 Damn, sorry hear that. Hope okay. Yeah! honestly care “right choose” regarding masks. 

I believe need strong national mandate demands police departments local safety officials ensure folks wreaking mask. 

People forget, pandemic. need drastic action. spikes large Northeastern cities huge protests weeks. i’m honestly really surprised—don’t get wrong, 100% support cause, thought going public health disaster. Here’s graph daily new cases NYC, example .. extention.

👍 Older people taking precautions staying home. STOP Wrong age group, though. young, mostly healthy people getting it. dream scenario reach herd immunity. PACU makes surgable ICU? Well course excellent question imagine I’ll find bottom little while... wear hot pink mask time now. People give weird look first, advert gaze know I'm right they're bad wearing mask.

Then sense good glorious ""helped"" fellow man. 


I realized earlier maybe I'm glass half empty kind guy, everyone else IS? I've spent life told ""quit bitching, could worse!!"" point ""IT COULD EASILY BETTER!!!"" people enough resources help LITERALLY every person planet MORE. hoard power resources ego, greed. Ill stop now. south, humid hot shit. sat outside yesterday hour came inside damn humid (85-90% humidity) like 90+ Add excess deaths, MASS WAVE ""pneumonia"" deaths worse.

people go sun though. Y'all better quarentine England. 😰 Stay safe, shit US getting crazy, would really, really like countries spared dunno man. go worldometers.info every day seen 1000+ several times recently. sure exact source. I’m research you. rest world hasn’t exactly kept secret. occurred me. many people Texas (and maybe Florida) getting tested corona virus employer required (negative) test returning work? 

If common, lot asymptomatic carriers found otherwise would seek testing? &amp; arrest people don’t take precautions end killing someone giving Coronavirus. That's literally said. 😂😂 lol reason downvoted Start now. literally nothing done ensure safety school setting. Consider teaching career start looking now. put position go back school found options. Ok nobody cares Haha there's lot stuff know, makes life exciting really need formal study conclude train wreck last 4 months turned everyone’s lives upside inside out, killed loved ones, created state mass hysteria, job loss financial devastation many people actually negative impact virtually everyone’s mental, emotional physical health? Yes work 8:30-5:30, kids home since March. want hair, need child care - simply cannot work teach time. two heads focus two full time jobs once. planning sending kids back school fall, frankly worried logistics juggling education responsibilities. honest, money throw problem probably big deal, hire remote tutors whatnot, extremely privileged position people aren't. lot kids totally miss year education schools open figure good alternative.

And clear, think opening bad idea. charge i'd cut thought right best plan remote learning solve issues working parents face that. there? would kill business, reckon 0.001% hotel stays usually 15+ days long  Scotland know two people working England reported same.

It's shame, media could promote good behaviour hope catches opt shame shock. Seriously, major paper outlet used front page headline yet. Yes seriously stating fabled backroom bonuses UFC doled out. assume Schaub's pay UFC least 3x disclosed pay (which crazy midcard fighter), would ignore good chunk disclosed pay immediately taxed paid training camp really factored net worth. Schaub complained shitty UFC pay multiple occasions said makes far money bad comedy podcasting ever fighting. 



I agree classifying fighting career failure would much though. achieved decently high ranking could stuck around wanted Actually bullshit. read Uber people Reddit it’s confirmed driver cancels lack mask Uber deactivated permanently; happened once.

It’s crapshoot matter way cut it.  Okay let make personal. GF black brother shot killed police bc thought reaching gun. grabbing fucking license cop asked for. acceptable collateral? Maybe people can’t breath mask people need stay home pandemic. Even cuts hands would gain little protection, feel need wear gloves pre-covid, think would feel much different gloves covid thing.

But certainly exact situation, can't really say appropriate you. wish possibility ones extended family truly gets impact severity this. real. don’t think media picked overlap rioters, Venn diagram definitely left huge contingent people (the ones real looting) weren’t affiliated anything mostly desperate couldn’t work didn’t qualify unemployment. 

Those people still around situation getting worse. It’s turning fucking powder keg. Fox news media.

Ftfy difference location areas overwhelmed? Sunday, holiday. So, 20K/ day next week?

that's good one! go work mainstream media stopped Lake District last night, figured wanted go pubs opening day everything would packed round end drove village near Airbnb, left car one pubs car parks bit pub crawl walking back Airbnb.

For don’t know U.K. Lake District posh, scenic, spacious population older richer it’s kind place you’d expect restrictions actually followed - isn’t case, nobody wearing masks, nobody enforcing social distancing, one lad came stroke dog chat me. One bar maids said one way system place taking people’s names numbers license wasn’t risk. Nobody really cares.

I think people realised people can’t cooped inside forever vast majority population never took lockdown rules seriously even place. you’re old vulnerable U.K. need stay inside, you’re counting general public following rules you’re nasty surprise. high hasn’t cause person corona sent back nursing home ALF, people died New York due governors incompetence.

Lesson learned, would worry people would think someone *did something* intentionally believe virus. death rate theae areas still pretty low though. sure stay way. longer recently something popular mainstream, reddit tends dislike something jokingly told vet hang onto ivermectin he's driving around cure Covid truck. 

And asked inject use pour on. 😅 Oh fucks sake. Honestly, think UK join US 2nd country see another massive surge cases tbh.. article itself:

Here's breakdown new coronavirus cases reported state day:
June 21: 2,926 
June 22: 3,286
June 23: 5,508
June 24: 5,004
June 25: 8,942

June 30: 6,563
July 1: 10,109
July 2: 9,488
July 3: 11,458 
July 4: 10,059

Soon averaging 15000-20000 cases reported per day rate. think Disney World reopening soon. said thing saw post. You’re exactly right.

The rich need poor people. can’t let get angry upset lest enforce change. rich would forced ensure poor folks somewhat taken care of. 

The rich stole 90% last stimulus... want remind everyone... money, every man, woman, child could gotten least $10,000 last round stimulus. Muy bien le cerraste el orto, hace quemar ver gente diciendo que los números son mentira, acá sería muy raro que pase eso nos entraríamos en seguida, pareciera que les molesta que nos haya ido bien used trick already unemployment system. sure base would tolerate again.

But would dampen antics data scientist.

Probably could use though, maybe save right either school reopenings buddy Dons big party August.

Thanks! You’re supposed to, people aren’t it. Honestly point thing state obvious. NY way worse FL moment. IIRC NY's positive rate higher FL's, suggests widespread infection testing ramped up.

If FL keeps current trajectory end worse. ever said brother anti mask?  Jump conclusions much? example see Israel closed infected schools month ago re-opening month prior that. difference country (the Netherlands) opened high schools yet, resurgence yet either like Israel does. cause effect still unclear understand need caution countries try learn other. Rope ladder get back in? Well, town Galicia, Celtic Northwest Spain, far Mediterranean, rainy climate similar South Great Britain, probably receives zero British tourists. Mostly Spaniards Madrid non coastal parts Spain. Thank posting this. granddaughter almost 19 worked barista one year couldn’t take anymore. She’s home COVID-19, PTSD can’t even look another job. Colleges universities closed Florida, 21-year-old sister stuck home mother whose office closed due virus. first job beginning said manager protected nasty customers. virus. got new manager wouldn’t anything stop people yelling kids. wonder many employees PTSD. makes depressed read way people treat teens serving public extremely difficult time. I’m glad you’re standing them. Anyone know long hold swab transit storage delay testing degrades false negatives?

Because normally want overnight transfer samples next day processing. got 2, 3, 4+ days thrown there. cannot imagine virus survives cotton whatnot 4 days. Thats awesome, hope good time!  I’ve seen 5 80 year olds wearing masks equally. It’s getting uncomfortable shopping stores half people don’t wear masks. believe yesterday's #'s.. Probably like multiple waves coming down. reinfection seem common fortunately beaches, I'm Boone NC mountains. last two weeks crazy FL NY cars everywhere! 

Was grocery store mask obnoxious woman looked family pointing directly stated ""see people convinced need masks, tourists need to""  course five shop together, unmasked. okay, surprising either!

Please. Please stay home 48,419 positive cases week ago. Wow. hospitals already struggling... number really hit me. He’s wrong. Well that's unintelligent inference part. say listen scientists? go. FUCK understand reiteration. Yep, heard gape come half patients Sacred Heart Spokane aren’t Spokane Co patients too. sure they’re though. really difficult, impossible, food stamps. I’d rather risk going store supporting Amazon Walmart. grocery stores near *finally* started allowing curbside pickup. Microholes bigger viruses Windsor Toronto either, saying joke would appreciated different sub. Ok, for-profit give money admins share holders I'm also social introvert see types close distance party scenes, get really weird sensation something inside tells me, ""this feels wrong"".

Of course, could locate infected people close open windows respiratory diseases century ago.

So shutdown NOTHING. :( declared pandemic earlier. scary one idiot restart entire infection chain, undo good work paid lost business dollars sacrifice entire country. I’m 100% you. residents taken thing incredibly serious hopefully agreement stance there, see people starting rebel though. Hopefully not, really think keep thing check vaccine gets One thing I’ve heard suggested essentially cancelling “specials” classes, especially music really risky, using specials teachers basically every adult find help “monitor” spaces lead teacher rotates around, academic essentials taught. Another idea I’ve heard running two half-day schedules, A/B day schedules, half students given time, ideas still staffing issues (do teachers work ten-hour days teach two half-day groups?) childcare problems off-periods. Personally since work high schoolers, online education no-brainer, heart really goes elementary students, teachers parents really good solution, series slightly-less-horrible approaches. basically spit get virus we're standing around talking that's virus 6 feet away talking that's virus passed opposite sides sidewalk without talking, etc Aren’t ways tell damage permanent, though? mean lung damage doesn’t exactly heal itself. Cardiac damage permanent, well kidney damage, stroke damage.. 

I’m aware type damage they’re talking about. curious. Well, die virus, ability kids going take serious hit. /s No. feel US coachable, we’re position ignorance, want establish horrific auto0cracy. Thank you. know beaches LA closed, also heard many residents drove counties open. Go Canada! 39 province 14 million. think they'd open watching kids work hours? Especially employed, conceptually issue. It’s easy US invests testing, testing testing. Nothing like getting whole story media. Jefferson also hardcore empiricist amateur scientist used yell colleagues unscientific beliefs ghosts real he’d haunting idiots right lol people wearing masks. 

More 30%? I'll take ""things incredibly obvious"" 500 Alex delivery ducts single runs, mixing ventilation conditioned air. ventilation mixed damper bypass ducts closed. yes, AHUs run 90% time constantly dumping air rooms dampers close.

Given current circumstances, modified system operate minimum ventilation theres code requirement large part midwest constant ventilation commercial buildings. Seen figures claiming 5% hospitalization rate. rate hospitals already swamped wherever pandemic spread unchecked, become much dangerous. Damar, drunk. ""Just...two...more...weeks""

-Doomers since mid March I'm advocating teachers return US. Watching guys right Canadian scary hell. genuinely fear countries well being.

I'm talking canada. less 200 new cases day across ontario, yet every teacher claiming wont return. literally went strike February claiming essential service (they wanted pay increase despite top rate 100k plus districts), suddenly saying arnt essential therefore go back pandemic.

American teachers get shift, im blasting them. California also rolled back business openings Florida cases started rise.  Americans ha e certain kind arrogance found another country. 

The social constructs effect... USA resources say South Korea, latter sense ""society"" helping ""the hive"" pushes people wear masks, follow rules.

The US? Government say ""do wear masks reason"" arrogant individuals revel wear masks. That's generous. closer 100%. Millenia Turns shit brains Patients say specific key words makes Dr's need hold evaluation: progressive symptoms, chest pain shortness breath etc concur. Online learning's HRD me, too, honestly like saving lives mostly staying home. I've monitoring deaths per day. definitely pattern extremely low death totals weekend. Monday Tuesday likely 80 deaths. still asking question?! One kid? No. We're seriously saying that. 

Millions children? Mayyyyyybe? That's super hard question answer without crystal ball sort. lost generation education, unprepared graduate turn 18 become adults... dunno means. one does. 

But consequence, that's problem. Young children home means unemployed parents. Unemployed parents means social/economic issues. Unemployed parents mean less tax revenue schools municipal systems. list goes on. 

And course, even kids. kids going fine. neighbors' probably will, too. son friends kid blocks over. Internet access right parents unemployed due pandemic. receive education next year things go distance. peers will. balance sobering reality fact that, statistically, parents probably fine get sick. 

I can't speak every parent. say fact parents willing make painful sacrifices graduates time peers condemned falling behind economically - they've said so. even question grandparents - like ""Yep, I'd die that."" 

That's.. Horrible. disconcerting. conversation have, we'd handled better outset maybe to. regardless... are. what? I'm gonna wish death him

That's ok will. Better people like die alone infect innocent bystanders. [meanwhile People actually pat back?

Please look comment chain.   

I mentioned stats Seminole County Sumter Counter provided links comments. maybe strange comment replied comparing potential human death ""super bowl"" not. 

I thought experts strong agreement median case age strongly related death rates.  Everyone seems strong agreement median case age (via numeracy &amp; awareness statistical trends) sharply declining,no? data clear.  basic stuff. Anyone questioning basic data maybe recognized weird angry troll something? 

""High level bullshit"" concerned human death related available info? assume trolling hateful person? Perhaps I'm misunderstanding you? 

I realize reddit attracts mentally disturbed people, may intentionally initially express bizarre toxic views comparisons. basic. super easy, low level amount research shows median case age equaling lower death, therefore ""super bowl team"" comparison (again, analogy - feel free respond displease brought analogy discussion)

With said, denial PPE absolutely new low country. fetish sending workers needlessly danger, taking care giving need, calling heroes afterwards.

In healthcare here, always advocate double check things. lucky treated human number statistic, worse inconvenience (see /r/twoxchromosomes complaints Doctors every day). many people often means life death (you hear much unless find someone personal connection story it. one charge going reflect it).

The American South known barely public transport “walking” neighborhoods. Everyone goes everywhere personal cars. Offices businesses much spread NYC it’s less costly per square foot. see huge spikes Texas Florida it’s probably 100% driven people refuse alter *leisure social activities*. two Hospitals good, rest screwed? even know germans thought could conquer people. scene Vail holiday weekend. Fucking tourists can't bothered wear mask anywhere. can't wait they've gone home :-/ sure? think it’s well established.

It certainly ""well established."" fact debunked.

Your pubmed link explain vitamin blood level determined blacks. traditional test gives bogus result blacks.

It also account fact blacks suffer bone issues associated vitamin deficiency.

I'm sticking NPR report. know 2 weeks give take days. convenient July 4th... makes feel better weekend, local restaurant near worker get exposed covid friend. Worker found biggest weekend year restaurant. shut place waiting worker's test results. Shut told everyone. Even got local news. worker positive, we'll see re-open. But, individual local level, people right thing. bet locals remember this. [You No.

No offense. rock star professor dies Covid university longer gets half research money, millions cases. Another Troll Dumb claim.

I amaze says something true. Uber drivers get paid passengers lol Well aware. 

It's like snowden said interviewed Shane Smith. choices make today stick around longer virus itself. ok effects people retirement homes. like Florida retirement home US.  sometimes suspect people like would welcome massive amount death Florida, prove point. Florida check Earthcams (.com) Florida beach cams... yeah, taking shit seriously... *sigh* Ohhhh. Makes sense. true reddit fashion didn’t actually read article. Oops. blanket curfews lock downs everyone regardless age doesn’t make sense. stayed quarantine long, created emotional reaction “get back normal”, resulted people throwing caution wind.

The half-assed lockdowns reason drawn-out long. policy effective people get exceptions. way stringent lockdowns imposed simultaneously nationwide back mid-March. Things could largely back normal early April. says quiet part loud. 

It truth. numbers northeast peak stunning.

I think there's lack death states ""just wait week two"". Buddy, I’m wasting energy argue you. I’ve seen I’ve seen. believe not. Wear mask, keep distance, register vote. Oops, actively killed grandma everybody else incivility.

My bad, RIP 😂 Sent chat. Yeah, fear mongers strangely silent Cuomo forcing nursing homes take Covid patients.  works. peaks goes away due masks quarantines.

FTFY, original statement working well enough US? “We’re going learn live guys!”

It hospitals filled brim wartime medical care. 

Buckle buckaroos   going happen trump gets voted office replaced competent leader. Good point, sure people gung ho COVID restrictions understand this. ...that would unlike Coronavirus (even severe SARS) there. think it’s natural exaggerate you’re posting online. don’t think OP straight lying, I’m definitely skeptical absolute misery they’re describing, think amount skepticism healthy. even phases either I'm happy them! Time start selling shovels around south side border. That's get sexing sexy Neaderthals. Ive ordering places dine closed. ill dookie America created optimal conditions. FTFY silver lining concrete clues states (at moment) take shit seriously let die. think lot people going shuffle around states extreme misstep. reference specifically medical grade N95 masks. That's people asked wear. run N95 masks general public medical community needed far more. Lower quality even homemade masks work fine regards social distancing. would want something better spent days ICU though.

Regardless however much confusion caused though, became clear shortly even homemade masks would benefit. debate point. New information come light. almost like people knowingly pointing outdated recommendations justify whatever want I'm glad posted this. children, hesitant suggest steps needed taken allow work home less interference children. sounds like running show, happening. DeSantis? U.S. cases increasing several weeks though.  point low deaths mean something.

I suspect combination tests, younger people getting it, doctors getting better treating it, hospitals mostly overrun like Northeast start, virus evolving spread easily less deadly - viruses tend do. Absolutely. world leader, I'd leaning heavily independent expert bodies advise best course action nation. Especially topic little political cross (medical professionals rarely represented cabinet) incredibly curcial lean national expertise friebds allies (Europe) 👍 Bubbles one thing don’t know anyone way. people know hang friends also hang groups friends on, pretending everyone “being careful.” masks, distancing among get togethers might well going restaurants grocery stores without masks too. 

I still don’t think hurts remind people family friends ones likely infect spending time with. completely give lazy like every way we’ve handled this. It’s possible mostly limit time work household, people don’t want it. asking question opposition stated opinion/fact *is* making argument. say that's bad thing poor.

The reason social distancing, mask enforcing, *lockdowns* maintained simple. know long term effects are. We've seen damage major organ systems recovering patients overfilling hospitals. That's need.

Also, please note stressing 'lockdowns'. Unless another situation entirely, never experienced quarantine. would single room lockdown, absolutely outside, doctors direct advisement monitoring. mass level would also people guarding streets enforcement.

As ""all motherfuckers never gotten virus"" hell would know? Asymptomatic cases HUGE reason concern onset this. sister never infected COVID 19, reason know one almost guaran-fucking-teed death sentence. despite mental health concerns locked apartment damn near 6 months. 6 minutes video, might put things different prospective you. 


[ 2008 Financial Collapse Shows Us Coronavirus Financial Crisis I'm Louisiana terrifying. Hurricane season started.

We pretty much fucked major storm hits anywhere gulf east coasts. get another katrina, andrew, sandy, ike, harvey, irma, etc, going see wanton death destruction. best times, hurricane evacuation tricky thing. 

i hope hit nola inlaws live. ""heroes"" national park nonetheless. Monumental fuck up... Honest question... went art school 90% classes we’re studios (the 10% art history classes). don’t think would’ve possible semesters entirely online.

How college courses art sciences, rely lab/studio instruction usage, even begin classes? That’s said goes way hospitals suppliers. suppliers don’t inventory materials supply manufacturers. But, stems issue, back stock. Look, work health care, since march 23rd I'm contact people positive daily base. I'm well aware possibilities getting infection, I'm well aware consequences, we've lost quarter patients disease. yes, know could get sick/ill/die, I've seen people ok *now* dead 2 hours. things mentioned definitely point discussion, part daily reality. things issue people might might already infected want tested. things issue people think ill want go back work secure income. things also issue certain part population can't take selves anymore. source this? implying got it, spread protests? Frankly two week lag time, neither seems likely. People allergies expected identify such, business can't guarantee cross contamination common ingredients unless know advance. put context headline, 2 Toronto hospitals covid patients ICU. There's still 39 covid ICU patients Ontario, far straining health care system. think modern thing sceptical/judgemental everything read. something finding hard overcome wonder people even aware it... Canadians awesome. imagine place people put community health ahead individual freedom?! what's Texas going next public protest groups decide expose body parts? design.

You say design, say panicky incompetence. agree they're ever going apologize take responsibility tens thousands lives they've killed misinformation. Fox harped Benghazi like crime millenium, ignore staff deliberately done. holy hell talking about? :(

I family Discovery Bay I’m real worried. agreed back then, wholeheartedly. I’ve changed mind that, I’ll tell why. you’ve seemed eradicate it, open back up, cases return. extremely transmissible virus, don’t believe permanently eradicated. new outbreaks happen, keep sending people back lockdown? works agrarian economy, long developed world. People literally starve. plane. rest mainland, people still drive take train, instead flying. something like places like NY NJ silly. Someone could fly Philly drive Newark couple hours.

Atlanta Airprt actually busier yea ur right point stillstands people hospital due things happened prior masks mandatory (and even then, fought court right now?) kid drinking soda defines America first began recall seeing chart said could survive cardboard 24 hours. Good know less! Im pretty sure first wave ended here. Keep spouting misinformation though 👍 impressed Ford administration way handled this. Full cooperation governments listening evidenced based science. Disappointed feds pandemic playbook ready slow response border control. lucky BC jumped hard this. Wish he’d stop talking. Like this? (Scroll swear country doomed. damn stupid survive.

""If virus real need catch like mankind always done."" What.the.actual,FUCK!? dumbest fuckin statement ever heard! risks, existing evidence strongly suggests outside protesting least safer indoor restaurant dining. alone help.

The problem prevalent masks US cloth masks. N95 masks nowhere found. thinking today! Yea Italy decided tank Trump would look bad. shows self centered naive Americans are. GLOBAL pandemic. could? Would help? Would make feel better? trying stir shit? Best luck friend. May odds favor. almost like slavery numerous deleterious outcomes societies rely know people near 70 think hoax. No. Bee. Taking temperature regularly. Feel fine. Worried could symptomatic carrier can’t believe July it’s still taking week get results updated information spreading surfaces? Heard rumors easily spread surfaces first predicated. even real? autistic Stan back see. bars, restaurants, theaters, establishments closed they're confined spaces, would opening schools logical? Thank forgetting logistics folks. medlog team clinic unsung heroes pandemic. accomplished multiple miracles us get in-house testing throughput needed be. insurance company hospitals know next kin send bills to. highest bill I've seen covid survivors 1.1 million Seattle. Death let family hook. Maybe use kind Christmas car meet Culturally, social distance lot anyway. significant number essentially locked dowm despite required. robust social safety net sick people stay home feel pressured go work.

It's super helpful compare rest developed world. Comparing rest Scandinavia useful.

The rest Scandinavia notably better terms minimizing hospitalizations/deaths. See recent comparison. can't change triple ways..I mean always gone chin strap wear wit nose straight showing out. never one symptom even fam/friend affected. mandate wear mask worthless small noticable change errbody fully committed lot us lost confidence lot sooner, sure us thought things would suddenly click there's crisis going on. It’s fricking airborne... fine long happening someone else

-- people florida probably I’ve two places signs stating masks required — USPS Wawa (a gas station) time go places (USPS least week since pandemic started) there’s handful people wearing masks. nobody enforcing it. know easy task, protocols schools page-after-page-after-page. definitely easier small schools. small schools might easier ventilated avoid *bubbles* meet/pass other, much harder provide enough space them. able open schools students time (in area) area around 100,000 people we've 1 (known) infection schools since slowly opened 6 weeks ago, point still believe could work. made hospital convention center. 

And treated zero patients there. actually set two temporary hospitals, neither used. “No contact tracing”. It’s silly people try refuse &amp; reject jobs existence COVID. Contact tracing needed order PREVENT spread &amp; understand virus working public health sector. Dang, based peaks incubation period COVID, looks like protests correlate increase cases. would imagine excuse.

I cannot understand 3rd worst hit country, would reopen major spreaders (right getting control) seeing US stab gut thing. outrageous almost worse UK finally gotten undercontrol knowing bad get, still reopens.... what??  NY yeah around 1k deaths per day one point quite crazy irresponsible releasing untested vaccines. 

If they're jumping skipping phases they're optimistic, still dangerous unpredictable. 

Then again, totally understand people want get it...

I really hope everything goes well... True speaking making legislation. I'm speaking influence public.

All President say ""We recommend wearing masks public."". says this, puts one move forward. But, ..., nope, can't that. Can't give ""media"" satisfaction seeing mask. F's sake. Nobody can. dangerous times. wish luck. 1 day? Stole comment lol, recently got hip replaced scheduled get another oxy hospital room 2 hours legit lot pain, told nurse, man I'm gonna make another 2 hours really need another oxy, laughed said well save 2 hours, instead morphine IV? like, uhhh . . . yeah bro, quite nicely, good chuckle😸 Hospitals base capacity surge capacity. seen hit base capacity, wait surge capacity overwhelmed. can't believe even gets close June/ July. People acting like June peak flu season normal. I'm exhausted. feel protests started day Memorial Day, right? America != world humanity though. America happens (some of) worst humanity offer right now. 

The thing made America great America itself, *spirit* inhabited America time, spirit gone many names past go many others future. 

America place people, sentiment makes certain places people great fleeting moments history human nature corrupts destroys it. 

The best hope time wave recedes little less, continue make incremental progress. ""According Bureau Engraving Printing , US paper currency made 75% cotton 25% linen."" Plus, US currency tight weave, that's likely survives longer currency say, 80-lb. laser paper. Well, monsters power asked us wear masks. terrifying. realize means (it good) mean time bunker till vaccine. Maybe b/c live one less impacted areas (NY) I'm going job, smart, live without panicking. get sick, get sick. accept risk every day walk door. I'm going camp counselor next six weeks. Half subreddit would freak job want give children good summer, accept risk. Wdym? people know hang friends also hang groups friends on, pretending everyone “being careful.” 

Then that's pretty much normal life, it? That's quarantine bubble is. personally never really socialized friend groups, lot easier avoid group socializing possible mostly limit time work household, people don’t want it.

A lot people unemployed right everyone lives household loved ones variety reasons. situations factored mitigation strategies else issues going pop up. Making people feel like prisoners solitary confinement essential stopping spread COVID, getting people change socialize often plays big role mitigation.

But let's go household-only plan moment. long supposed last? cases manageable? so, long take? not, amount time people isolate? there's vaccine? I’m giving gold comment New York city broke overflow hospitals, sounds like believed worst behind them. It’s mainly due younger demographic driving surge. happened first NYC. virus moves risk groups, deaths rise. It’s boiling frog scenario. variant devastated Bergamo NYC, D614G. gets fired Yes Man/Woman gets put say it’s right provide shoddy data back up; setting us back *even more* President lying it. 

The people willing listen experts, versus listening President, already knows full shit. take information President run it... experts telling President wrong won’t change mind; fact could even drive towards President’s corner even could/would rationalize misinformation deep state trying steal election. Everyday work Pretty sure would bring Bashir along wingman. Maybe make look better. Data would accompany research.

A human, Gen’Eng, android walk Romulan strip club..... one exists US one first get it. money throw around economic push. Look position Oxford vaccine Miami-Dade Tampa Bay really bad work in. Compared rest south. really high bar.

Stay hell CFL tho. assuming \*want\* you.. Im glad feel well informed. hospitals prepared? Let's see still think death rate goes .5 10% run ICU beds.
That's happened Italy Spain... still take away fact social distancing followed . honestly feel whole protests big factor Vivid spreading irrespective reasons protests was. like Trump American govt gonna anything good response Lol Question: many days worth data part 10,059 cases number? can’t believe American stores still allowing people shop without face-masks everything that’s happened. absolutely insane me.  interesting short discussion another commenter rioting. people well looters part BLM. thought beginning stimmy bux drying up, possibly qualifying unemployment (im boat), potential eviction moratorium throwing thousands onto street poverty. Theyre scared see bright future ahead. may rumblings come leadership help people much helped corporations. Remember suddenly homeless government give safety net bailed banks, much lose. shitbird comment leads believe hoping divisive. Let’s not. old high school well 100% fail students teachers. funding cut proper meals janitor cleaning, leaders school simply care. Many times went bathroom blood handles doors, handles sink, even paper towel rack. Actual human feces wall ceiling falling students, pee floor causing students fall / step pee bringing outside bathroom huge gaps stalls causing students careless bathroom know people walk time seeing using bathroom know need finish quick. terrible think about. 100 thousand dead Americans people cannot muster empathy understand like. news channels saying it’s hoax cause people get sick die. extremely disheartening see. ICU beds used covid patients. knew rules avoid chose follow them. deal consequences adversely affect people infuriating part ""debating"" (read- arguing pointlessly) Covid truthers repeated implication ones dont enjoy lockdowns masks. hate it- lot- us capable acting greater good. smooth fucker.. *You're lucky 100th customer! get both!* mistake make assuming wealthy struggling.

Jeff Bezos making insane bank economy shifts even online.

People making money. nearby local restaurant owners downtowns, 1%.

The markets fine billionaires still able contribute. 

Unemployment matter impact them. Many buyers right now. know entirely related article, interesting see US deaths reducing day day. suspect we've gotten better treating (which one arguments shutdowns first place), stands reason hospitals receiving ICU patients without available beds going reverse trend somewhat. lot sympathy staff hospitals. Masks prevent infection, also make every subsequent infection apart time allowing steady flux patients hospitals allows long-term planning. 

If go grocery store, similar enclosed climate controlled space, wear mask. That's virus transmits well, contaminated air lingers. outside, risk reduces simply particles linger. especially true high humidity, since also fall quickly ground. essence, containment strategy basically be:

 - wear mask indoors public times. 

- physical distance outside public.

 - create limited social bubbles get-togethers outside (no indoor gatherings) easily trust contacts contacts (close family close friends)

- limit contacts outside social bubble participate large gatherings*

* Protests merits appropriately proper social distancing mask wearing.

That's beat thing get things back normal, requires large percentage participation population. Otherwise, get exponential growth, politicians forced shut economy. Can't believe July  America still failing see correlation. mistake, think misread something. thought cases stagnated 14,270 amount positives last week see massive increase hospitals two weeks.  leaders know health experts.  shut fuck let health experts speak.  

Both leaders, population listened. Ok 30, 40, 50 year olds? LabCorp also specifically told us OK sample saline ice 24 hours even putting VTM. Helps mass sample collection off-site prepping/sending end day. Gatling lasers power armor. Also r/boringdystopia"
