So yes, improving economic prospects personal freedoms might worth risking lives either end statistical extremes. given vaccination rate 60-80%, we're talking dozens deaths hundreds severe cases. sort thing expect seasonal flu. Given Covid never going eliminated rest world, New Zealand can't expect Covid free forever. Fuck, vaccinating realistically thought possibility.

Correct. if, point time, due e.g low incidence, calculated specific age group - say teenagers -, risks vaccine outweigh risks getting COVID, authorities immediately revoke recommendation - happened, e.g young women Norway AZ vaccine.

You can't solve pure technology, option nightclubs simply check people coming always remains.

The nightclubs lobbying government quite allowed reopen, stating could safely. government provides pretty simple instructions follow fail so.

Finally, I'd challenge come technological solution removes requirement ID checked along QR code. Keeping mind QR code also available paper form (for people without compatible smartphone) QR code usable (by person) multiple times within validity period (40 hours test).

Plus, companies already working mRNA flu vaccines, could even better previous ones.

Ignoring differences methodology (which know till see study &amp; likely important), dosing interval (3 weeks Israel vs 8-12 weeks) requiring single dose there's prior infection could explain differences. Respiratory diseases responsible deaths infectious diseases US, flu major problem. That‚Äôs extremely low bar setting trying determine place virus lives forward. make difference efficacy comparative i.e. what's proportion vaccinated people get infected compared proportion unvaccinated people get infected time.

It would make difference seeing differences behaviour otherwise comparable vaccinated unvaccinated populations still better protection one dose unvaccinated, good variants. Double dose protection seems largely unchanged though.   link Amazon press release directly website. advertising. That‚Äôs great question. couple reasons I‚Äôve seen people get vaccinated individual either allergic components vaccine ( pretty rare, seems like someone allergic one vaccine, probably okay different one ), may immunocomprised ( rare black white since compromised immune system means lot different things), people belong demographic much data vaccine affects ( children obvious group, debate also includes pregnant people). Hopefully additional time developments, pool medical conditions exclude people getting vaccine able shrink. Sweden cases deaths several times higher fellow Nordic countries, wouldn‚Äôt exactly call beacon infection prevention practices. 

Even people mild infections every vector provides opportunity mutation transmission someone could die result. focusing eradicating virus, flu longer content allowing large amount virus freely circulate population likely never rid entirely end new variant makes vaccines less effective. delta variant already demonstrated ability mutate way decreases efficacy, longer plug ears pretend long illness minor it‚Äôs fine, likely end back square one.

If COVID vaccinated, you‚Äôre seeing 93% reduction severe disease. actually know herd immunity needs virus? thought bunch best guesses. It‚Äôll worse US bc many idiots refusing get vaccinated. it‚Äôll worse among only‚Äî could care less point, they‚Äôre themselves. Exponential growth doesn‚Äôt exist.

A things look like exponential growth, never long.  We've tried nothing, we're ideas... simply locked first place would sacrificed things all‚Ä¶ reap sow understand, absolutely imperative many people get vaccinated possible. themselves, around too, say. 

However, assauge concerns fully vaccinated: third US got Covid last winter, supply chain disruptions caused worker illness nothing compared panic-buying lockdown-related causes. Nearly 90% elderly vaccinated US, group far likely need hospital bed. UK, despite seeing huge increase case numbers Delta, experienced rise hospitalizations anything like it.

All say that, even vaccination rate US enough herd immunity, still enough drastically reduce negative impact Covid.

If opening vaccinated everyone OFFERED vaccine, imposing restrictions groups made wait longest, entirely unfair.

The scary part UK full third / delta wave, you‚Äôve begun.

TIL, thanks interesting read.  r/yourjokebutworse  69% infection 80-90% symptoms No. likely dying Covid medical reason get vaccinated- they're lazy ""it happen me"" mentality. They're told friends family, ignore them. Misrepresenting vast majority deaths non-preventable disingenuous. basic concept sounds interesting Putinistan probably interests geopolitical advantages western countries using vaccines themselves. lot Russians inherently antivax, irregardless vaccine, don‚Äôt want take things. Putin knew start. states reporting days week, aggregating previous days. state (MI), aritificial spike Monday don‚Äôt report weekends anymore, weekend data gets lumped Monday. they‚Äôre going Tuesday/Friday only.  Totally, see something like last fall many regions appear immune comparison we've seen past year half. However 50% vaccination rate rural city sufficient enough protect 50%, especially public health measures tossed aside. comments thread prove said correct also proves many people clearly didn‚Äôt read article basing comments headline alone. 

He‚Äôs 100% correct can‚Äôt continue think Covid. stated, highly effective vaccines preventing hospitalization deaths, even cases rising. That‚Äôs great news. 

He also stated 7 million people come forward needing health care delayed due covid. Judging comments thread though, fuck people right. There‚Äôs also mental economic tolls need focusing now. 

Bottom line is, was, always get damn shots move life. Googled seems like still 65s/vulnerable people move 65 group till 28th July. So, yes they've got long way go Yes.  80% people know think stomach flu flu.  One person insists flu means stomach bug even mild food poisoning influenza fancy name bad cold see quite vaccination also reduces transmission risk even infected i.e. 70% reduction infections drop R0 70% itself, higher proportion remaining 30% asymptomatic would expected unvaccinated people also reduce R0.

Of course, retaining basic measures like masks, social distancing/being outside, contact tracing reduces R0 beneficial margin error/time/prevention variants/etc point view.  variant factories inevitably produce variant immune vaccines, I'd agree, sadly, take everyone them. Thank sharing, feel better getting vaccinated soon! Welp, got vaccinated Pfizer April came positive Covid. Lost sense taste smell 5 days ago... Luckily actually took seriously watching happened/is happening countries mock ppl concerned it! That's understandable. got upset Everytime ask something Reddit regarding medical issues, people always assume reddit source information write comments like ""go ask medical professionals"" they're right about, always assume person asking something Reddit already consulted doctor beforehand?

There always people unwilling make right choice factor every decision angle comes public health. Ignoring help anyone even feels good ""punish"" them.  Slight correction: vaccines provide virus immunity; immunisations. Theyll probably notice brain damage have. can't say certain, intuition telling either think they'll affected it, they're afraid make sick work, they're afraid cost money despite public information repeatedly stating free. employees also company-provided health insurance ability take additional paid leave positive Covid diagnosis end getting it. make sense either.

I agree GP strategy makes sense supply less issue. second wave came much later Sweden European countries, despite relatively restrictions. 
 
No, 2nd wave came ""later"" Sweden 1st wave really peter off. two waves collided Sweden.   takes long time case marked ""recovered,"" even person longer sick, different countries handle different ways. put much stock number.

From Worldometers:

""Recoveries = statistic highly imperfect, reporting missing, incomplete, incorrect, based different definitions, dated (or combination these) many governments, local national level, sometimes differences states within country counties within state. recommends following criteria [symptoms resolve + 2 negative tests within 24 hours] [symptoms resolve + additional 14 days], recommendation. countries, patient discharged hospital counted ""recovered"" even test performed. health officials consider anyone diagnosed COVID-19 three weeks ago died recovered disease. view this, ""Active Cases"" ""Closed Cases Outcome"" depend number recoveries (in addition accurate death count satisfactory rate case detection, lacking vast majority countries) affected inherent flaw many countries total worldwide count."" US aint special comes antivax. Russian taken jabs Sputnik V simply thought best option available me. induce antibodies people, many tested. might believe lancet ""efficiency"" numbers, certainly expect par AZ JJ vaccines, better, since 2 jabs. 

Sadly, nothing covid-related, coming Russia, trusted - covid numbers, deaths, vaccine efficiency, probably vaccine manufacturers supply chains. Propaganda lies default modes operations here. I'm trouble convincing friends get vaccinated since really independent studies safety efficacy cite. even get started fact, ""no adverse effects reported"", safely assume Russian reporting vaccine adverse effects non-existant.

However, expect publications Nature umbrella higher standards. titled ""Mounting evidence"", yet cite almost evidence, unverifiable claims 2 tiny studies several hundred people. even repeat Kremlin line ""first registered world"". Obviously, wait phase 3 trials registration, going faster... reads literally like paid promotion, article one respected scientific journals world. shameful shit. American sense potential freedom given shit ton weight actual ability freedom, yea, kinda is. mean R = 0.5 means exponential decay. one unfortunate minority. Thank you. feel lost right now. It‚Äôs unreal.  talk doctor getting booster shot sooner normal, keep protection high. vaccinated today. still time? gave control group placebo shot another group real vaccine. Neither group knew got placebo vaccine behave differently. test group 94% fewer infections compared control group say 94% effective. NZ either. even need show ID domestic flights. American analogies apply we're talking NZ govt.  selective morality really cracks up. 
It‚Äôs disgusting charade. 

When talk restrictions hear ‚Äúbut people die‚Äù .. yeah ok , wrong people die it‚Äôs bad ‚Ä¶. it‚Äôs BS Saw local news tonight ventilators. respiratory therapists need set-up manage them. one wearing mask, even stores now. going get worse schools start again. One co-workers lost uncle covid week. know reference means discussion trusting NZ govt. govt never said that. said right start flattening curve would work going tight lockdown could last months would totally eliminate virus. lasted 2 months soon clear virus gone, returned life full normal. yeah, trust govt here. are, medical border workers get first, oldies second, everyone else last. No. means get variants, song dance humanities sunset, unless get bizarrely lucky. link staying blue. ;)  govt signed agreement purchase technology early June expected mass produced October. Fiocruz already part production line. Since January import raw materials finalize process. October they'll produce everything locally, even raw materials. So, please tell New Zealand done contribute international effort develop produce vaccines? lol dude Israel fully vaccinated 57% population.

UK 50%. 

That ‚Äúlarge majority.‚Äù

The general consensus herd immunity needs least 70% entire population fully vaccinated - one dose, 70% eligible adults, 70% population 2 weeks 2nd dose.

People keep throwing Israel uk around like things inevitable even vaccination none places anywhere near close numbers needed get things control. think Jurassic park..and keep happening comments removed, polarised subject UK funded development vaccines manufactured them, got early access. NZ neither advantages. purchased plenty doses 4 vaccines time UK. start getting mass shipments Pfizer couple weeks. survive plague inc Sorry literally consistently commenting Reddit past 11hours ?? Go something else real  "" plenty "" statement. 

Allergies medical conditions prevent people getting vaccines, encompasses small percentile. 

I'd guess every one person medically cannot get vaccine, there's thousand refuse get it. Thank this. Appreciate insight.

I'm personally fan multi-lingual idioms caught eye beyond component covid19 aspects. no. suppose give wholesome answer also contributes meta.

Do even Reddit? Imagine making false claim confidently saying people uneducated.


Mutations always result weaker virus, likely selected grand scheme evolution. mutation completely random, result deadly virus. also result weaker varient.


The less deadly versions tend spread better, kill host therefore propogated efficiently. also possible virus deadly spreads better. much, much complicated random framing it. Glad see this. Still waiting libraries open here‚Äîit really show life getting back normal. Good friend mine moved SK right hitting third wave Canada. 

Kept telling jealous moving there. turns sure tabled.  Would honestly say would prefer NZ's position rather simply vaccinated?

I feel separate things. NZ great leadership mostly benefitted generally isolated country, things considered.

That means things flipped considerably longer ideal isolated dependent production lines countries. life always deadly covid itself.

We secured rights 4 different vaccines enough doses cover population 4 times made deals September 2020. became clear Pfizer best upped buy one cover whole populace. receiving 350,000 doses Pfizer week mid-July onwards quite low vaccine hesitancy NZ. 

Keeping borders tightly closed vaccinate continues best strategy kept economy strong. also scored second world return normality recent index, behind Hong Kong. hope either, especially since NJ one heavily vaccinated states nation. would hate us keep masking every year.

I've cut quite bit contact last year COVID views (and Trump..) really helped sanity. I've stopped caring think feel.. literally scares shit me.   Way call freedom dumb like seatbelts work least one person died seatbelt on. made night generation taught us believe everything see TV believes everything see internet. Lambda already crossed England. hear popping European countries. Weird flex ok like study first place, numbers scooped medical system made press release of. There‚Äôs lot Americans ashamed lot things.  Let‚Äôs start denied deaths half million Americans thorough 16 months committing propagating copious amount mental gymnastics.  

If national statistics shady look local coroners report.  guarantee deaths 15-25% 2020 without significant bump would explain category.  Antigen test probably show positive since spike protein made vaccine still present week. want PCR. Sign fuck tbh lol. Yeah, I'm fully vaccinated care less anti-vax knuckleheads myself, still want know personal risk is. negligible, small, moderate? take trip? go party? eat restaurant? info there, better equipped make decision staying safe. know make leap ""we must re-institute lockdowns"". downside tests zero idea levels antibodies relates actual immunity. account T-cell response WBC frontline.

It's good data point though. symptoms, minor soreness lethargy. I‚Äôm worried rarely adverse reactions shots medicine vaccines development year. participated clinical trials last year completely fine. wait? 29% never thought one begin with. lots information available? article covers quite nicely Covid  70% reduction infection translate 70% reduction transmissibility. There's research CDC highights science brief shows infected vaccinated people still lower viral loads less likely infect others. vast majority spread going among unvaccinated people, proportion vaccinated people needed suppress spread high calculations using efficacy infection would suggest. Given CDC estimate 1/3rd population already infected likely bias previously infected among unvaccinated, think US we're really close crushing thing decisively.

Now get rest world sufficiently stabbed arms.  pace, none athletes Tokyo like her. Although mutations may affect GRP78 Covid-19, seen paper showing GRP78 receptor? 

I seen in-silico prediction remember seeing paper using real virus (or pseudo virus) show Sarscov-2 enter via GRP78 alone.


I found this, show GRP78 ""a host auxiliary factor think commit one year mark move goal posts? Aside point long term side effects past first months, also year trial participants nothing come either. hope late adopters come around sooner later. here. I'm fucks give.  Yeah mean, still can't travel kids can't get vaccine. I'm still limited things locally. globally far done. Vaccine uptake 95%+ older populations Netherlands too. statistics poor though don‚Äôt get accurate numbers. 

The official statistics based people live home could come mass vaccination center. People vaccinated GP institution counted uptake statistics (yet). counting vaccine doses huge failure sure. I'm also healthy young adult caught covid. absolutely horrible took weeks feel like breathing back normal. vaccine free there's reason get it. hesitant? True every way matters per capita. life ever pre pandemic. least hope not.  changed family better.  forced leave 15 year career stay home dad.   Gave triple digit salary. 

I happier. Fair. number way lower everyone claims. Heck circle hear claim usually ask doctor specific advice answer bunch mumbling 80% people claiming talking ass. reasons people mention actually reasons getting vaccine.  It‚Äôs similar people claiming breathing problems can‚Äôt wear masks. I‚Äôm surprised Florida hasn‚Äôt seen record high numbers yet sure vaccines favor drinking driving! need antigen even better PCR test. antibody.  Wait what???? Doesn‚Äôt Australia desperately need shots??? Antibody tests show positive positive since you‚Äôre vaccinated. shows antibodies, regardless whether it‚Äôs vaccine virus. get negative result means vaccination wasn‚Äôt successful.

What want PCR test, see live virus you. clones viral genetic material, present (ie infected) show positive result. way things going third wave they'll 100+ deaths long :(

Obviously far better 1k would call ""almost extra deaths"". decrease due demographics (current wave skewing much younger previous ones) vaccines. vaccines work, they're magic unfortunately deaths still expected. Interesting tidbits another article 57 cases reported date, six breakthrough cases, health officials said. Breakthrough cases defined someone becoming infected 14 days second COVID-19 six people got COVID getting vaccinated, think still small percentage,‚Äù said Annamarie Davidson, M.D., Memorial Hermann Hospital. ‚ÄúAnd good encouraging vaccines they‚Äôre supposed health district said 47 cases youth adults 12 years older 10 youth younger 12 title be: ""Three 10 Americans stupid"" Also, pandemic long lasting/forever impacts financial ruin loss loved ones, still could correct answer even world went back operating exactly same. No, he/she's correct. Members population consciously betting fare better without vaccination die due choice  overworked, burned healthcare workers need help hospitalizations?

Sorry comment really irritated me. We're fan preventable hospitalizations either hope send help need it. understand big fuss around Olympics. sport competitions going on? Various tenis opens, Euro2020, Copa Am√©rica, Tour de France, etc. thought 3 10 Americans believe pandemic thing. Herd Stupidity Preach brotha favor anybody dying, I'm stating fact.

Natural selection thing, deaths could prevented people took vaccine.

I wish got sense heads stopped fucking vaccine conspiracy shit get asses vaccinated start wearing mask. I‚Äôve testing waters restaurants going library still wear masks possible try practice level physical distancing eating drinking. dont want either, want attention  **40%** expect lives ever normal again

Mood. aware 99%+ contract survive, right lol. Hardly Darwinism natural selection. hardly make dent stupidity. get this. think daughter vaccinated, would come close feeling same. took/take pandemic seriously, state/city/locality really feel ""over"" times. **not** saying case; get feels way! virtually anyone age 12 vaccinated. going ever get much ""over"" right people. feel bad kids whose parents stupid get vaxxed protect them, personally can't much that. New cases trending downwards ever since vaccine became available state less thousand people died total state. little risk now. pandemic sense flu over. always here, protect it, unlikely anything worry about.  ‚ÄúYou always count Americans right thing - they've tried everything else.‚Äù

Winston Churchill Well lot folks lost someone love, don‚Äôt think ‚Äúgoing back normal‚Äù that. I'm struggling find data question I've having. I'm fully vaccinated (Pfizer) COVID-19 earlier year. protected delta variant already COVID-19? know fully vaccinated protects it, protected vaccinated person already catch COVID-19, data anywhere showing much would protect me?  Video footage Sydney, Australia shows case &lt;10 seconds sufficient infection. course rare case, average time infection can‚Äôt magnitude off.  Thank you!   could even good thing. ""normal"" commuting work 2 hours every day, employer supports remote work permanently, life ""never normal again"", might pretty happy that!

I think takeaway that, even though we're beating COVID, left lasting impression society, good many people recognize that. selection

Why people keep saying this? 

The virus mostly kills people past reproductive age. Australia vaccination plans difficult understand outside perspective.   convinced propaganda COVID never big deal first place, see true. very, sad public health crisis virus care became politicized. never bad.  data yet long interaction time qualifies ‚Äúmeaningful interaction‚Äù regards delta variant? 30% probably said done peak.... Possibly stupid question trying avoid news little while. 

Because delta variant transmissible mean less deadly? 

Or transmissible deadly. people fully vaccinated, basically area USA. stores/restaurants near require masks anymore. first lifted mask requirements, could tell people hesitant, month later I'd say definitely 50/50 half longer wearing masks half still wearing masks. employees/waiters/cooks/etc see longer wearing masks. Everything basically back pre-covid exceptions  mean, would assume answers that--rightly--include people's feelings climate change, etc. really makes realize badly individualism ethos become United States. mean, one thing individualist, independent spirit - ""won West"", historically. another thing entirely go Libertarian we're looking beating back pandemic requires robust levels group vaccination defeat. sad trombone Glad hear this. basically response either Pfizer doses aside sore arm sometimes (jokingly) wonder accidentally got saline placebo.  However conservative Supreme Court upheld so‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs confusing. love individual liberty would good test conservatives failed. It‚Äôs California‚Äôs fault it‚Äôs hot!!!!! answer ""yes dumb"" thanks lol Delta variant Man media companies willing encourage mass deaths keep working class fighting I'm trying make clear NSW, slow lock down, acting line. AU decision decision made one state affects others  mean think it, much changed permanently. Companies recognizing function fine without extensive travel expenditures least reducing costs best interests. Meanwhile remote work stay, many companies keeping place majority employees, moving employees hybrid schedule allowing reduce overhead terms office space. 

Both things make ripples throughout multiple industries, change many lives. Meanwhile employers struggling find workers willing suffer pre-COVID conditions, meaning low wages, terrible hours, general inflexibility poor working conditions. They've moved found jobs industries laid early pandemic, intention coming back. force small businesses particular find ways pay staying afloat, likely bring changes way service industry particular operates many places, things also change lives (mostly better one would imagine though). 

Other industries take longer come back, ever reach pre-COVID levels again. going comfortable packing movie theater opening night new Star Wars movie? I'm sure be. Every cough throat clear make jump. Small venue indoor concerts? Sketchy. Massive cons? Shit think I've con get sick dozen I've to. Used call nerd flu. thought makes shudder. much germaphobe before. now. hated flying, tolerated shitty conditions loved travel. Now? I'm paying lot attention what's within day's drive know soon I'm going excited sardined metal tube hundred strangers couple hours ever again. commuting subways packed gills? Used daily lived DC. I'd rather commute two hours early go home three hours late transportation option lived now.

EDIT: might get tricky though planning going plane planning roadtrip type thing u visit multiple countries since every country EU different policy vaccinations, testing etc. horrible thing say. We‚Äôre worried much making sure science confused adults feel normal. matter one around vaccinated... that's matter.   ""The Virtue Selfishness"" Ayn Rand practically foundational text Libertarianism.  supply limited like early pandemic we'd build stockpile holiday, 3 week point newly approved group like Memorial Day.

We get 1M average approve new group. source 15% greater people vaccinated long term symptoms covid infection post-vaccination? numbers essentially say chance getting Covid (long short) aggregate US 14% six months vaccinated. 

No, exactly. numbers represent moment time. caseload changes, risk. risk exponential function, linear one people intuition for. mind last summer vaccine saw significant decrease cases well. base rate calculation big variable.

The asertainment bias *much* larger last summer (i.e. many undetected cases). Also, strain circulating last summer considerably less infectious. Ugh, horrible! Glad mess behind now! unlikely another public health emergency decently-vaccinated areas like California. enough unvaccinated people left overload hospitals, even disease goes wild among them. course, meant governments overreact seeing undervaccinated regions crisis seeing numbers tick slightly time. would reach 100,000 though? Considering US hardly lockdown haven‚Äôt seen cases spike much. would equivalent 500,000 cases US. could possibly get bad UK already lots natural immunity vaccine immunity. Also, may backlog cases seem rate increase UK gone kids also home school england reduce covid cases. fully vaccinated go live life don‚Äôt listen doomsayers. Thanks, long year agree. nephew, also agree. He's high functioning autistic *extremely* sheltered whole life (home schooled, raised religious fundie home, part religious scouting troop -- sports, friends outside religion, exposure cultures). He's smart exceedingly gifted math discouraged sciences, instead pushed ministry. He's 15 covers tv unwed characters kiss. already rude awakening this. Whole family worries him. **‚ÄùThin‚Äù isn‚Äôt prophylactic transmission infection.**

Blaming obese people covid severity won‚Äôt fix this. Covid isn‚Äôt binary. Lots (15+++% long term symptoms)  thoughts kids eligible vaccines yet? Especially considering information coming high rates long Covid complications affecting them? 30% baseline crazy people, people probably still believe pandemic. pandemic over. virus stay, it‚Äôs overwhelming medical systems, keeping people inside states dropped lockdowns‚Ä¶ idk think supposed look like? Perpetual fear maybe?  really interesting local stores measure, 100% people think Pandemic over.

Stores even signs Masks anymore basically 95% people masks. i'll say it: pay people get vaccine. Probably people think answer common knowledge now. Sometimes tough remember everyone obsessed vaccine stats, i'm guilty tbh joke. pointing ""always next variant horizon"" soon media runs something talk about. Soon Sigma Zeta Christmastime... Hard unvaccinated people fully vaccinated 19th July, especially UK gap doses generally 8-12 weeks.

But agree you. can‚Äôt protect willingly unprotected forever. Go labcorp get quant antibody test. doesn‚Äôt show whole immune picture, you‚Äôll know least created antibodies, etc. think large number ways die world. point, dying covid don‚Äôt trust vaccine pretty silly way go. Control control mitigate risks can‚Äôt.  I'm really glad hear say that. frustrate greatly. I've fully vaccinated since early March. Truthfully, Delta variant scares shit thought way Delta started becoming prominent. ideology carried work last time. us normal ass people convince others right thing. one else going it.  hErD u/lilscammerthatcould fyi Curious know well That's unfortunate. Although, really extreme rarity bad luck. know immune system numbers places like Israel, story relatives. Thanks reply. Also people country can‚Äôt get medical reasons. still wear mask around strangers folks, everyone know personally vaccinated, I‚Äôm worried us catching other.  Get vaccinated suffer consequences long covid. Pretty simple.  Olympics 16 days. takes time vaccines effective. wife tried get tested traveling. symptoms, proactive. Two different places told us self-pay price test would combined $500. afford it, chose since sliced Papaya Coca Cola tested positive. clear choice support matter decides, worried hope make choice protect herself. wants talk fears. Supply calm facts believes things true it.

A good angle is: ""If still afraid it, get yet. decide ready. What's holding back?"" 6th 12th graders would least 12, excluding maybe incoming 6th graders.  minority thought Vietnam too. still made war end faster. surprised isnt way higher. 

Thinking life isnt going ""back normal"" global event lasted year pessimistic, realistic. 

Was world ever 9/11? still deal TSA every time fly. 

You hear people say ""since covid"" ""before covid"" generations. Long covid patients new emerging variants reasons try reduce spread. didnt realize it, talking wearing masks even vaccinated. would pretty much impossible see case counts 10x high previous peak. looking 2 million cases per day - 1 every 150 people newly testing positive every day. know infections higher cases, talking number millions people infected every day. That's reasonable hypothetical. And, present, we're like 95% LOWER previous peak. I'm 0.05 * 0.07 = 0.0035 (or 0.35%) risk then. I‚Äôm it, vaccines now. I‚Äôll still wear mask shit need I‚Äôm gonna go restaurants get drunk friends again. record, don‚Äôt actually believe get ventilators. I‚Äôm irked anti-vaxxers. Also, Lambda doesn‚Äôt escape neutralization well beta (and even delta believe). think Americans lose weight?

I think think   Wall St Journal reporting lower viral loads infected vaccinated people.

Viral load would different end point symptomatic COVID CDC stating people breakthrough cases 58% less likely fever spent two fewer days bed.

Right, real-world vaccines behave like hypothetical vaccine illustrated above. Instead 95% efficacy COVID 95% efficacy severe illness see asymmetrical divide, like Pfizer's MRNA vaccine Delta variant. see 64% efficacy symptomatic COVID 93% efficacy hospitalization. 

The reason looking symmetrical case first make clear measured. numbers lag, keep eye next 4 weeks.  Thanks, ""mild"". Re: feel like utter shit would probably 10X worse vaccinated. Thank much  3/10? actions, least 4/10 seem think never pandemic.  Yellow 1 9 cases per 100,000. MD uptick 0.8 1 metric puts median risk.

However June 95% cases unvaxed individuals putting case rate vaxed 0.1 vs 3.5 unvaxed.


So agree, northeast littlerly people get massive numbers again. Yeah. Austin‚Äôs pretty low entire time compared places like Houston Dallas. Houston what‚Äôs driving numbers much. (i know called English), muscles like ""lock up"" painfully

Sounds like cramp? used get calves (lower leg), foot would basically point lock straight calf muscle release half minute, definitely hurt like hell. socially sure here. rarely see masks doubt they're vaccinated. dont give shit. don‚Äôt fix stupid. don't. Public opinion like 70% delaying canceling games. certain point Darwinism. I'm vaccinated studies show highly protected normal delta. Death cases new cases massive decline US pretty much deaths unvaccinated. 

I'll wear mask I'm sick, I'm going go way continue pandemic life waiting anti-vaxxers finally get get shot high enough vaccination rate. fully vaccinated health refugees may declared independence COVID-19 disease still shadows lingering next strike. Thanks, too!  It‚Äôs over? looks like age groups 34 herd immunity, 25 34 kinda there, 16 24 big problem. Earlier school years seem relatively ok.  went street asked 100 people, bet would get exact opposite results. Hard feel ""normal"" can't get enough people vaccinated stop variants spreading keeping alive lingering fear infection. ...it's enough people getting vaccinated. familiar POTS? appears one problems called long covid.  would loved fly wall, top level meeting, led decision. Pandemic Florida. Tinder dates never even slowed.  NOT. spread fast Delta. Delta prob due SPEED. hit unvaxed breakthroughs Alpha (previous fasters) not, things settle. Vaccines, less effective, still neutralize variants. also limited amount mutations arise spike ceases bind human ACE2 receptors...so finite prob likely slow unless previously unseen advantage mutation stumbled upon (these errors replication - like virus thinking smart humans - current mutations popped independently different locations) 0.07% chance every time run someone rolled potentially 1000 times. making numbers hypothetical without justification. math come pretty absurdly high odds person eventually hospitalized covid. 100 ""rolls"" 7% chance hospitalization - roughly case hospitalization rate past year US (while people unvaccinated, counting confirmed cases universally regarded large underestimate actual infection totals).

The effectiveness 93% drop relative baseline risk unvaccinated. August 2020 July 2021, CDC tracked 2.3M hospitalizations. That's 0.7% US population hospitalized course one year. 93% reduction 0.7% would 0.05% chance hospitalized course year - hospitalizations common among older people 30s, risk hospitalization substantially less population average, let's say 0.02% chance given CDC hospitalization trackers showed age group less half hospitalization rate ages average.

That would estimate hospitalization risk next year 1 5000. Considering crude *death* rate someone age 1 500 per year, covid's risk point background noise. that's assuming we're likely exposed virus past year, that's unlikely case. reality likely estimate risk. I'll pass. Thank kind words. collapse still mostly contained Java, worst spot Jakarta metro area - although islands would definitely get fucked they're preparing inevitable spike, thanks lesser healthcare coverage.

We've locked since around mid-June, gotten first AZ shot also mid-June. Wish us luck! think need hug tolerate relatives like this. feel nephew though. teenager, maybe fully understand consequences pandemic he's forced participate things along parents, absolutely sympathy spread around willy-nilly. Someone's death could hands.  FL didn‚Äôt get extra time Covid post-vaccine time. use PTO both; I‚Äôm certainly fortunate could even that! You‚Äôll horrified hear 40% nurses Missouri hospital work don‚Äôt vaccine‚Ä¶. made mandatory we‚Äôll see people double quit give Yep. would 40% people answering never expect life pre-pandemic normal again. expect better. really think work home thing permanent huge chunk companies there. different pre-pandemic, much better go office anymore prob w delta spreads quick. two (delta+ lambda) nearly well. prob like antivaxers breakthroughs already gotten immunity.....there alpha+ Beta super evasive...they take hold anywhere. common mutations neutralization evasion seem lower ability transmit quicker.  tattoo I'm fully vaccinated right butterfly tramp stamp getting pounded dude knows Covid free virtuousüòÅ Well seeing beginning overwhelming healthcare capacity, seeing clearly hospitalizations done substantially age vaccines, seeing end month eligible willing people fully vaccinated, suggest this?

If vaccines good enough nothing be. unknown disease april went 65. 49   There's still kids 12, lot people conveniently ignoring.


But understand people left stay locked in. already 1 flu, we'd rather second one goes around year. Especially since people could get much worse health outcomes. mean one bad thing deal mean good news another bad thing top that.  That's joke. people know one kicked balls vaccine. feel anything, others got headache soreness. Ditto Georgia. Hell, governor opened state fast even Trump like, ""Whoa there, slow roll!"" No: UK AZ. EU used mostly Pfizer. AZ second used distant.  memes govern social structure (and mean memes proper sense). Unvaccinated groups suffer losses lose influence accordingly. rest us move without them. tragedy get witness knowing certain spokespersons blatantly acting bad faith dosed eyeballs vaccines since moment wealth got access. they've already polarised everyone, winning many new audience members whilst sacrifical pawns suffer consequences believing erroneous things.  Yeah, think continue wear mask now. can‚Äôt find it. 

I find several studies indicating heart damage occur COVID. 

I also found Hartford medical study 1200 COVID patients hospitalized 45% heart damage. However hospitalized sever cases. 

I also found study done West Va University 54 students mild cases asymptomatic evidence inflammation fluid pericardium author notes ongoing damage. 

I found two studies showing heart damage 19% 12% patients, respectively, patients hospitalized cases, indicating sever cases Covid. 

Nothing found indicated 19% mild asymptotic cases COVID heart damage. here, felt like death would preferable fucking delirium. Tried smoke pot relief, made feel delirious nauseous. Fun stuff. Germany extremely cautious right now.

Currently plans potential lockdowns restrictions cases rise rapidly.

The pandemic yet. I'm 27, American, decent shape (5'2, 145lb). caught covid November, persist thru December. started feeling better January first physical since 2019 May.

At point I'm saying virus, developed stage 2 hypertension. Like said, know probably never know virus, think there's lot repercussions people act like. clear: asking someone care potentially spreading COVID people?   &amp;#x200B;

Why can't use ""WHAT CHILDREN"" convince people get vaccinated? Women CHILDREN first? 
 
I know kids usually die COVID, longterm affects still unknown, especially variants. really want give kids covid? delta variant seems display milder symptoms people. even evidence new variants cause ""long COVID""? They're practically different strains point.  can't use ""WHAT CHILDREN"" convince people get vaccinated? Women CHILDREN first? dead? 


I know kids usually die COVID, longterm affects still unknown, especially variants. really want give kids covid? could conflation ""pandemic"" ""quarantine"" since restrictions lifted almost every state Still entirely true, even fully vaccinated.  agree, said months ago got downvoted oblivion 'brushing carpet' caring people die.

Also point trying make. easter miracle! onion tied belt? much depends US talking about.

I‚Äôm going wondering someone would sit act like better data it‚Äôs objectively bad date. There's plenty AZ shots locally. Anyone age get it, although recommended 60s. want one, go book appointment GP. Depends are. city, absolutely. parents little town, still several days. started restrictions later countries choice keep restrictions longer countries (they let third wave grow something it). also kept schools open unless 3 cases 1 classroom year, without testing kids massively. Spain closed schools easily quickly, limited movements regions months, France unless time limited containments. Maybe (and EU countries) better (i.e. less 'spectacular' rational) measures France, that's they've able lift restrictions earlier?

Jeez, that's sad. :( wonder whys behind answers like this. Like they're grieving super important person life world can't ever seem normal without person? tinfoil hat types still sanitizing groceries? front line workers much trauma they're sure they'll get it? Whatever reason, sad think many people outlook. Yeah lot dead count anymore. Cuz lol reading comments ""downvoted oblivion"" 

Why scarequotes?

Were able find downvoted oblivion? not, read point trying make?

That finds funny. Low vaccine rate, hardly anyone antibodies, delta variant. Seems like 2 choices lockdown till fully vaccinated massive outbreak.  Sophistry, designed confuse reader push nonsensical viewpoint. ashamed poor debate skills. Enough supply mRNA vaccines whole population coming last quarter, slow steady supply meantime. AZ recommended 60s, producing much it. What's definition ""cautious"" exactly ? I‚Äôll bet is, would suck happen People want vaccine got now. over. Would safe say 3/10 Americans live rural areas? vast majority people live towns close maybe see 10 individuals month max. people, pandemic seemed like frustrating time wear masks came city biweekly get groceries. potential outcome lasting effects make dangerous.

I've seen bad lasting impact people, health... Worries lot. Yeah, heard also 6 months-2 years. know come time 2-12 follow it. wonderful get emergency clearance September baby 6 months September. anyone else tired scared whole delta variant now? family vaccinated, Delta, bringing 2020 flashbacks terrified 65+ parents dying, they're vaccinated sinovac keep seeing people like ""my uncled died fully vaccinated sinovac!! they're usless"" 50 upvotes people claiming it'll 2020 again, feeling super confident going back normal.

I understand vaccine effective pfizer moderna (I'm fully vaccinated latter) sucks go ""phew! they're finally vaccinated"" ""damn im scared getting Delta dying"", they're torn getting extra dose right since got second dose 3 months ago might time booster yet (I asked last week since months they're worried soon).

I know scared clickbait media trying scare people us vaccinated folks clear, regardless vaccine have. 


We going vacation disneyland/universal studios next week making anxious excited, also trip planned august postpone covid first hit, want cancel time I'm scared downplaying things. suggested last year got told ""propoganda"" showing ""one side"" ""fear mongering"". less effective

The CDC disagrees Relatively little people hospital, vaccines open all, cases may rising that‚Äôs really relevant anymore - don‚Äôt lockdown cold. Common colds kill people too, know? again, updated late May go off, guess. Sorry I‚Äôd rather look data consider solutions settle shaming people shit obviously sort context for. Wonder approach effective? Right crazy safe, compared point since pandemic started, yeah agree!

And keep mind need 10x many total cases order read day 10x many daily infections previous record. 

The % growth daily cases quickly % growth decreasing gives information high peak be.  

For places recording 70% growth week week sustained period time, think near peak. 

I make prediction high peak get, UK example, would surprising end daily cases previous peak.  Makes relatively safe attractive place tourists tbh.  post euronews imo europe relevant since us already discussed posts  AZ. one produce locally. produce million week. currently recommended 60s dont need much. Pfizer Moderns need. Governor DeSantis, you? There‚Äôs difference Pandemic COVID still major threat.

I impression already officially downgraded Pandemic. main point still stands, info fucking April. Gee wonder vaccine access looked like vs. US? know want build kind overarching social narrative frankly excuse lazy. Lol yeah even close us government wants us think that. I'm sure ""want"" much they've convinced impossible.

Sure, things never exactly same. Especially lost loved one. took normal ""able live life way one wants minimal risk"" feel vaccine. I'm going choose get corona avoid risk heart problems. working year half hopefully keeps working. Failed give update: reflecting similar patterns. 15% stores around DSP wearing masks indoors. here, except mom's side family including mom never get vaccinated, can't make them. Oh yeah notice responded 2 places. dont understand travelling one top priorities  Pestilence. Famine next. Actually reading pre-print morning delta variant. Apparently viral load Delta greater 1000X original virus. also able detect virus earlier (between 3-5 days exposure rather 5-8 days). points greater replication efficiency. That‚Äôs great maybe want know folks aren‚Äôt getting it, it‚Äôs worthwhile ask listen responses. fact survey linked doesn‚Äôt even ask worries missing work due side effects clue maybe we‚Äôre asking enough questions reach/educate people. 

Similarly, rather straight assume everyone doesn‚Äôt understand lazy, maybe consider number people language barriers, technology barriers, learning disabilities, mental health barriers, etc mention well founded historic mistrust vaccination programs certain demographics country have. Sure it‚Äôs wildly frustrating inconvenient, welcome monumental task educating large populations healthcare issues. men still think women can‚Äôt get pregnant sexual assault, you‚Äôre shocked taking awhile sink folks? Hell, half us trained even think healthcare financially it‚Äôs wildly unattainable. 

Idk, seems like super arrogant tone folks take sub must great feeling superior people exactly rooted shitty realities healthcare messaging education US.  even varies zip code. county 50% vaccinated specific zip code well 30%. mom always behaved like never one. Could states undercounting? It‚Äôll totally worth it. know it‚Äôll expensive covid hope I‚Äôll get opportunity go there.

On issues:

Guns, said, American oddity fit anywhere spectrum.

Abortion became legal Northern Ireland 2019. fact probably surprising lot people England. Attitudes towards religion gay marriage also pretty similar NI US Bible belt.

In fact, support gay marriage fairy equal across UK US, legalised countries around time.

""Socialised"" (lol America) healthcare something I'd put ""economic"" category. spending taxpayer money. Additionally, NHS often framed ""national pride"" issue here, much like vaccines.

As issues we're right US, immigration one sticks most. US, standard claim right ""I'm illegal immigration, problem people legal way"", even attracts pushback. here, people talk massively reducing legal immigration 100k lower without seen outside mainstream, Tory politicians often so. would make real hardliner US.

We're also quite far right US drugs. legalised medicinal weed strict conditions, whereas US states liberal laws (de facto legalisation) since 90s. Many states also de jure legalisation. Public support also much higher (67% vs 52%) US.

In terms idpol general, tend *follow* US rather leading (this sometimes results blatant nonsense, like protesters shouting ""hands up, shoot"" unarmed British police). mean, caseload small use vaccines needed most?

Consider people need leave country reason. would nice second shot life makes one people. explanation super detailed, interesting biology what's going test. seem strange, could right reason there. 
 

But know evenly done throughout country. Aunt east coast get covid. uncle lived her, told quarantine never even tested him. such, fact providers also process NHS tests. done make sure tests available need I.e. symptomatic cases.

Better one need ready case do.  I'm sorry dealing that. empathize, also long hauler. worked 4 months afraid never going back. kind news, helpful, indeed depressing. feels so... final. Like, answer whether there's way out, answer hoped for. So, who's bashing us time surrender doses countries instead vaccinating people need back off. Beach still one safest things do. Nah. fall winter going eye opening people. December 21 months since vaccination trials began. That's enough data see long term effects vaccine may be. Trial participants 100% getting monthly tests, weird shit written down. Everything really bad rarely happened seen fast. Myocarditis, blood clots. vaccine causes autoimmune disease something, we'd see too. happened yet, won't. vaccine hesitant people (if truly taking vaccine fear fast) come around. antivaxxers, friends family start dying, pattern almost exclusively unvaccinated, come around. least 70% population immune Dec, Jan, Feb next year. Covid numbers went way last summer vaccine too, also giving people false sense security. gets colder again, capacity rules, masks anymore, see. gonna fuck around find out. US, vaccines administered pharmacists aide's local commercial pharmacies country, well doctors, officials drive centers medical centers, etc. nation would issue number practitioners comes delivering vaccine, numbers alone countries like US scale vaccination rates, disproportionate population ratio US NZ. Hugely disproportionate. issue numbers. issue institutional professional competency. Apologies, right reading back clear. 

Let elaborate bit meant ""at risk"" aspect, yes New Zealand done exceptionally well protecting virus they've working tirelessly catch every possible contact every case human nature experience nations previously handle pandemic shows delta variant different beast given increased transmissibility, take much quickly spread given relatively low vaccination rates tiny number people who've recovered due stellar work that's done. fact dispite success keeping virus they've still finding cases daily basis.

Of course hope experience we've here, we've decided let covid rip population many still vaccinated.

Would prefer New Zealand's position, course death disruption seen UK devastating. 

In ideal world there'd enough vaccine everyone matter moment viable route pandemic vaccine. Permanent quarantine facilities....ok then... get free Covid test kits health clinics UK colleges AU like that- hesitant deeply anti vaccine

'most' stretching lot. Amongst older age cohorts 70-94 able vaccinate while, take Systemic viral spread would cover possible mechanisms long covid, correct? CFR lower since vaccinating strictly age, age distribution infected skews young. 0.3% toward end Alpha, delta took over. Likely now, could change age distribution likely grow older (when young people vaccinated, still done) delta could different level mortality alpha, could measurable number breakthrough cases presumably would ~0 mortality. Wow Nature believes Russian propaganda. Well I'm 36 year old Brit I've never heard that....so knock lol vaccination rate eligible adults thusfar 67.1%, accurate possible. 18 states, 70%. Unfortunately distribution extremely polarized. really happened. Australia NZ politically mismanaged accept early offers vaccines get names queue early enough secure sufficient supplies later. another posted noted officemates getting vaccine, despite local supplies available, bad thing, vaccine fairly short shelf-life whatever doses unused wasted. opposite help countries ""that desperately need them"" cop-out political mismanagement locked two countries long. cannot produce vaccines lack talent facilities produce sufficient quantities, cannot secure lack political competence so. intended vs actual vaccine rollout numbers give away people nations unwilling admit, due lack humility. would vaccinate child? think vaccines negative risks? 

The thing changed amount vulnerable people like raising hand make known authoritarians tighten grip society name. throw ""conspiracy"" me, done throughout history.

TourismNZ year march 2019: Tourism generated direct contribution gross domestic product (GDP) $16.2 billion, 5.8 percent GDP.

Texas, can't require masks governor. 70% people; that's lie. 70% arbitrary subset people. issue doses tied state apply everywhere though. 1000% correct interesting. Thanks sharing perspective.  Sounded like calling loopholes phase 1 trials, single dose natural infection higher measurable immune response two doses without infection. many studies this; look ""previous"" /r/covid19. AU like that- hesitant deeply anti vaccine

Nonsense. 30% adult population already first jab that's without 40s eligible. vaccine reduces chances severe infection. meant keep hospitals becoming overwhelmed again. One still become infected - symptomatic asymptomatic - long covid. need sorry. level smug also ""because can't personally imagine government could possibly better"" angry response ""what could possibly do?"" find attitude wholly incomprehensible, live sf area (by large) people paid creative mope around say woe us.

One example government could possibly shared elsewhere thread. Another link posted today sub SK striking deal w Israel exchange vaccines allows SK benefit Israel's surplus Pfizer w promise resupply Israel future SK delivery. suppose government tell us working something like (you announce deal done)... anything? coasting?

Even it‚Äôs like flu don‚Äôt get hospitalized severely ill, still afraid something wrong several months possibly years. Fuck noise. only, what's point imagining impossible scenario? there's magic potion take stops getting covid. something like existed, course everyone would take we'd done, one would stupid they'd pass it. think travel hub roll roll food supply stuff true point put context government absolutely commited making zero meaningful change anything wherever Zealand fortunate deal widespread community spread, allows effective track trace (an area UK failed dismally). 

I would like say, New Zealand fortunate, big part fortune excellent governmental work policy decisions. would also like say UK's track trace failed high cases (something largely attributed dismal governing) also failed deeply corrupt poorly managed, technical political point view. 

I never forgive government allowing ""world beating track trace system"" thousands people contacted whole thing run outdated version excel. guilty corporate murder. Also, Pope shits woods bears Catholic, something like that. Canada pharmacists distributing vaccines, well firefighters, emts, doctors nurses. One facility Toronto 26,000 shots 24 hours. population wants get vaccinated people line up. numbers 

(1-0.00103)^(30 days x 8 groups day) 

Grocery store, mall, transit, workplace, sidewalk, etc

In 30 days chances getting Covid vaccinated 78% 60 days 61%. Crazy think taking trip ICU due COVID pretty much completely optional country, yet people still don‚Äôt take simplest action basically guarantees safety. Wild. poor boy. Show mask touched you.

There nothing wrong wearing mask keep others protected. Multiple studies confirmed protection even asymptomatic infections (i.e., sterilizing immunity) degree, 65%-92% efficacy:

I stand original point. Catastrophes disasters often indirect downstream effects. deadly, might actually save lives (for example, fewer people got seasonal flu last year.)

If look death rate county like US, subtract COVID attributed deaths, looks like deadly downstream effects outnumbered positive ones. 

‚úåÔ∏è man Darwin comin thru preaching vaccine One best friends works Mayo Clinic said he‚Äôs seeing young patients severe lung disease following Covid infections. scary thing says many cases conditions aren‚Äôt getting better, getting worse time, similar pulmonary fibrosis. said seeing patients like prior Covid many cases he‚Äôd begin bring options end life care, many cases younger patients without severe health issue history prior Covid, he‚Äôs unsure progression path. one convinced early get vaccine. mean rural counties can't outbreaks.

You could also get struck lightning sunny day clouds. 

The percentage people die Covid vaccinated vs unvaccinated miniscule, something like 1%, even worth mentioning. even close equal. Since ""long Covid"" related tissue destruction Covid expect vaccinated long Covid mild probably undetected.

I think existing antibodies vaccines means mild post-vaccination infections much likely *legitimately* mild compared unvaccinated infections, immediate symptoms may strong virus wreaking havoc behind scenes. risk infection *significantly* lower people vaccinated. So, one okay breeding ground virus, one get vaccinated. remove possibility, goes long way toward reducing close this. could end similar death rate. nowhere close highest death rate. Officially 21st highest lot countries lying numbers. anyone vaccinated could feel good locked position 18 months ago. worse variant spreading much contagious.   SARS2 become endemic, way eradicate (even good intentions - - - have), always variants. big word you? overhyped? two dangerous variants reaching contagiousness measles don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs terrifyingly contagious one contagious existence. 

The problem significant portion US isn‚Äôt vaccinated, could pretty bad people.

[From source NYT refers 57 cases reported date, six breakthrough cases. Breakthrough cases defined someone becoming infected 14 days second COVID-19 vaccination. Forty-seven cases youth adults 12 years older 10 youth younger 12 years.

There's 90 additional cases self-reported county's health district confirmed there's detailed breakdown them.

They give breakdown many 450+ people vaccinated though. positivity rate 25% among people attended gives good idea contagious is. one major thing concerned Covid, along obvious potential health implications. 

Like insurance companies ask smoke ever diagnosed (insert disease/condition here), Covid affect premiums possibly pre-existing conditions, especially ACA done away with. 

I‚Äôm lucky vaccinated without infected, rise insurance costs won‚Äôt affect people Covid.

I know condescending. everyones first language English. native language cold considered common flu. 

Regardless bold statement dont know longterm effects covid yet. get extremely sick mean internal damage. overweight? work essential worker? around vulnerable people? wear mask? questions must weigh vs fight off. Otherwise selfish pose serious threat producing mutations harm others already vaccinated. Great news, I'm still closely watching Delta variant others make sure evolve problem vaccinated.

Also, getting covid jab ‚â† anti vax. anti *this*vax  say wrong  That's probably true extent, see reason fairly consistent reasonably long period time. daily US cases drop 20k 10k expect cases generally going down, even true number actually amount higher.

Shocking. believe that, also sarcasm, know people believe this, dad really deep even trust it, imagine trusting Fauci. Yeah noticing sure. It‚Äôs misinformation pretend vaccination completely prevents transmission. super unpopular among North Americans, especially Reddit (bring downvotes y'all), fuck wish kept mask mandates longer. really hard turn back culturally never really whole 'mask sick' pre-COVID.

It's like celebrating race cross finish line losing arrogance. need 'maim' virus walk away still 'gasping air.' need stick around stomp boots turns dust. fucking game. Unfortunately, COVID done us.

Just guessing think downvotes super rude it. cheers read statements 'continue lockdowns' kind post, misread something. Largely I'm agreement you. Go out, stuff, I'd still recommend masks indoor public settings. mean, we've -got- used already. 

If want visit family/friends take masks off, that's decision forth. I'm surprised adamant people pulling back -all- safety measures now, usually based purely emotional reasons. I'm also often shocked many willing discount safety kids. work kids, lot parents bring public places socialize, (Under 12, unvaccinated) kids wearing mask. 

Like said, there's balance. Masks simple, cheap, effective, understand rush away them. They're -that- annoying wear. home throwed vaccinations. Estimates Texas 48% state‚Äôs population covid.

WHAT?! holy shit would even day twice likely get 100% transmissible   Absolutely. far much money interests stake admit anything. I'm cal guy. live house downvoted that's efficacy calculated. 93% protection mean 7% people end hospitalized. means 93% fewer people hospitalized unvaccinated group.

edit: think ""compared vaccinated"" actually capture this, missed first read I'm betting people missed well. yeah, 69% protection infection and, given infection, 80% protection hospitalization combines 93% reduction odds hospitalization. spinning negative, that's also going buy downvotes. Last study showed vaccination decreases transmission somewhere 40-60% This. Switzerland, Greece, France, Sweden lower vaccination rates much lower percentage fully vaccinated. That's major first world countries.

The US 55% vaccinated 48% fully vaccinated. Russia 18% 13% doses Israel tried send PA? really good news, considering rate new cases rising?

The estimates may off, seems like adults antibodies enough stop transmission. Hopefully provides wall huge increase serious cases, early tell. I‚Äôm COVID nurse exact experience well.

Excluding effect giving lower estimate still susceptible people. pool quite big nonetheless.  assuming worry comes hit side effects call work days.

Whose stats average Europe.

Their society can't reproducted anywhere else, choose, I'd prefer live rather somewhere else constant looming threat lockdown. entirely sure hating saying I'm bit shocked, given successful mitigating spread beginning. I'm aware USA Europe are/were hoarding, thought NZ would supply given relationship ""West"", OK took longer expected. haven‚Äôt sick, even sniffle well year now. also protects skin sunlight I‚Äôm treatments. love mask. ironic. age-group complained able anything, go ... and, way, responsible high infection rate MIGHT get everything closed again. difficult keep distance? well ... fun lasted. sounds like good number, even delta even newer strains infect even 20% vaccinated, 'only' 5% 'die', that's lot people. Thats dead (in US) already died. count unvaccinated. unvaccinated able mount immune response still fairly significant small % millions people.

Not majority people young great majority *them* mild symptoms. group constitutes vast majority hospitalizations well vaccinated UK. like *is* mostly Republicans. survey showed 57% Republicans surveyed think pandemic over, 4% Democrats think same. Vaccinated / recovered people still much catch COVID spread (especially longer take health precautions go community). much unlikely die even require hospitalization. It‚Äôs great article. Also covid decreased life expectancy 1.19 years US. Even decrease life expectancy higher US Vietnam. Yeah worries - mostly speak 40's look like we're mostly giving pfizer days. 5 cents forced stop Olympic games mid way along line. sizable chunk group wearing masks (I‚Äôm joking) think vaccinated people somehow toxic vaccine is... contagious? don‚Äôt know people think, apparently that‚Äôs new conspiracy theory: Wear masks, protect *vaccinated* people.

Whatever. least wearing masks now. Reduced risk compared unvaccinated population.

The unvaccinated population already level defence due natural immune system protection. Vaccination reduces risk.  fair, also asked people thought things improving, 89% responded yes.  EU certainly targeted AZ vaccine without considering risk getting covid outweighed risk blood clots opinion . 90% less lethal. also means month difference 1 case 50 cases day, month difference 50 cases 2500 cases per day.

Yeah, that's thing.

It's called employed. could try sometime. cares? harmful regular. Stop fear mongering. Fair enough Great know Victorians suffered 4 lockdowns nothing. Thanks guys. I‚Äôm team ‚Äúmask forever‚Äù - love they‚Äôre still required airports airplanes. 

I feel like used get cold half time I‚Äôd fly anyway. story Novax Covid deniers tell you.... birthday today. combination virulent, deadly strain virus, weaker vaccine, higher exposure, older person it. Geezuz would say freakin Neanderthals, would smear Neanderthals. Stupidity extreme scary hell. UK even chaos highly doubt be. hospitalizations surged deaths still single digits. makes sense. Got vaccines early game. wouldn‚Äôt put past California enact restrictive policies whiff increase cases. appreciate insight though makes sense me. society whole seems ok flu, see point trying make here. saying stay locked COVID even less deadly flu? got shots children's doctor. (Got 2nd ones today)

Also could get one next week work. right‚Äôs incessant moaning ‚Äúright‚Äù vaccinated 

Why ‚Äúright‚Äù quotes? Yes, right refuse vaccination. It‚Äôs thing, perfectly legal thing that.

You hand right force vaccinate wishes.

But I‚Äôm sure keep insulting expressing much despise them, they‚Äôll sure come around bidding. vaccine friend get? one would tell get instead? give shit. Acceptable who? thats mr. tribal chief you! Yeah, gives shit? Insurance refuse nonsense. infrastructure already there, use it? got 2nd shot today children's doctor. Vaccination Germany done ""any local doctor"" (even dentist would allowed - age limit vaccinations ""children's doctors (they legally limited treat &lt;18Yrs) - (Not sure registered nurse allowed though9. 

Also central registration also ""a mess"" shifting doctors decentralized lot, thus removing bottleneck. much easier ship 10 X locations (""just"" add drivers) get 10 times certified people (doctors) allowed perform jab.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall getting shot today took like 15 minutes (+ 5 minute walk), included reregistering 4 patients since new quarter. Might vaccinated southern state, still 54.3% least 1 dose 46.5% fully vaccinated. also count tourist, long stay snow birds, recently moved crazy housing market last 12 months census form 18 months ago. kill buzz skipping school pretty soon

In many cases, sure. times I've skipped school childhood avoid things definitely felt worse boredom. there's plenty kids ""worse thing"" every single day school, due bullying. Yea, severely deal damages organs nerves, you‚Äôll fine  told both? Asking medical professionals advice, asking redditers (who autoimmune disease) experience vaccine. wrong me?

Just keep you‚Äôve mask up/distance you‚Äôre considered full vaccination you‚Äôll fine. Honestly even reaching 10 day mark first jab gives solid protection work way second shot/full-vaccination.

Good job getting vaccine! immune issues shouldn‚Äôt taking precautions like covid? plenty things covid could affect immuno compromised people. P.S. epi might be, country X vax rate Y% (and non-vax rate 100-Y%, whatever reason), vax rate enough curb less transmissable variants, transmissable variants still spread.

We glad got it, even daughter (she **HATES** jabs) didnt fuss all. one customer told today skipped getting 1st shot today :( bit ""denier"" already didnt think would skip shot :( Big difference areas. county lot spare doses people signing appointments anymore, even though aren‚Äòt even 60% rate yet. confused, still hospitals surprised coronavirus patients? prepared??? Thank you. We‚Äôve super strict daughter due health. makes feel good choices making. see people going around acting like kids immune! kids screwed though.

Doctor told push I‚Äôll get better eventually lol I've never heard issues vaccines stored improper temperatures anything like worry it. thing goes old ""mishandled"", exact thing could happen J&amp;J.

Personally I'd definitely recommend getting Pfizer Moderna they've shown prevent 83-88% symptomatic covid infections, J&amp;J likely 60% lower. countries begging get vaccine people realizing privilege have.  really is, look US whole kinda par. wanna say pathetic half country counties pathetic, counties 2 levels that. lot counties sub 40% **65+**, sub 20%. wild. Still misleading. Likely see reports like future, important fact Well across pond news Delta Plus week so. talk Lambda variant, that‚Äôs one you‚Äôll hear winter. Dying libs‚Ä¶ try explain worried vaccinated friends frequently. important information seem common knowledge reason. Super low seems. vaccines protect heavy severe side effects.

I‚Äôd guess 10-100x lower chance.  Healthy 24 yo mexican kid already got covid, get vaccinated whenever shots get here, hopefully bye September, yes love mucho thankfully perhaps little todo much. Yea don‚Äôt really understand people keep acting like isn‚Äôt factor. many people US even left don‚Äôt antibodies, either vaccines, already Covid? It‚Äôs gotta less 40% population, right? completely missed major point entire thread. Japan really weird vaccines, industrialized nation; might say attitude conservative. Oh know 

But do? large fraction population doesn‚Äôt trust vaccines. don‚Äôt want mandatory vaccines, think opens door slippery slope,

Eventually, gonna get Covid, vaccine not. 

Those don‚Äôt get vaccinated get immunity infection. die. get long term effects.

If people don‚Äôt want vaccine, won‚Äôt get it. Maybe someone close dying getting sick change minds. I‚Äôm honestly surprised it‚Äôs week since WHO‚Äôs new guidance Murphy hasn‚Äôt either brought back masks, least publicly discussed circumstances he‚Äôd bring back mandates. ""chance"" - look dictionary know Moderna uses higher concentration mRNA shots

this honestly probably it. higher concentration mRNA = spikes created = body higher inflammatory response = antibodies memory cells etc etc. it? Lmao  guess happens people use powers common sense, knowledge, wisdom... (Õ°‚Ä¢_ Õ°‚Ä¢ ) wanted learn greek alphabet. economic damage avoided one enter leave country?  realize also 0% chance catching covid avoid people.    That's study, finding contract tracing Israeli government did, even data properly contextualized. Even Israeli Health Ministry says enough data currently determine happening Delta variant. meantime recommending masking abundance caution, think totally reasonable.

And *even if* assume studies par preliminary findings (they probably won't, studies Delta multiple countries show much higher effectiveness), chances catching covid fully vaccinated MRNA vaccine still tiny fraction suggested (the odds suggested actually worse odds catching covid completely unvaccinated). 

A drop 91% 64% sounds scary, reality could difference one two people testing positive studies. 

When there's body data showing Delta vaccine defeating, I'll change tune. little evidence currently, plenty evidence it. I'd say like 9/10 live. bars clubs full, masks sight distance anything still lot cases (on city least). kinda worrying tbh, weekend felt like lockdown xmas again.

i wanna optimistic amount people giving single fuck... stellar virus able spread well vaccinated communities. 
If case numbers able keep rising even vaccinated communities, means number cases little 4x high order deaths before. 
But cases absolutely could gotten 4x high past, implement policy/restrictions curb spread. 

I think 23% chance still means need implement policies curb spread able spread vaccinated communities. amount protection vaccine gives preventing infection super important, think, towards determining restrictions fully lifted, future still look like past two years. Definitely agree.  human beings bees

Imma need sources dawg ask 30% people think pandemic ever believed real pandemic first place? Yeah it‚Äôs basically extremism Yes.

I‚Äôll never consider small emergency fund sufficient again, I‚Äôll probably always pantry better stocked staple foods 2019. I‚Äôll remind anyone variety careers second set skills shift jobs emergency.

Hopefully people realize wills health insurance possible, too.

I feel really bad said dont get (yet) get many downvotes, bad mouthing. 

I really want civil discussion educate open minded it. mean lost close family member friend Covid, life ever normal you? Nope. COVID variants going love it. think strict crowd controls limit exposure case COVID. never COVID - YET.

Basically normal things. ordered pfizer late. rush sinovac politics. actually 40m doses Pfizer august. could used sinovac population used AZ, pfizer moderna medical frontliners. is, paying price mistake. countries like Singapore smarter get Pfizer Moderna great. think sinovac much expensive pfizer. grandmother one states she‚Äôs probably going die year COVID. I‚Äôm amazed hasn‚Äôt already. one family know gotten it. ‚Äúwaiting see‚Äù there‚Äôs issues. 

At point don‚Äôt say anything really. They‚Äôll either die won‚Äôt. I‚Äôm tired worrying it. liberating receiving vaccine remember risk remains rest world waits get vaccinated. biggest fear vaccinated people begin forget everyone we're still risk. extremely difficult, I'm vaccinated therefore I'm safe, family jabbed we're safe, country well way majority vaccinated fact remains vast majority earth's population yet get access vaccine. We've done well three billion shots administered there's still lot's go. western world want normality we're going bite bullet pay poorer nations help distribution.

I truly understand exhausting remember we're woods yet. seen data it, I've read claims conservatives moved Texas helped Cruz beat Beto.

Thankfully me, folks moving inner city neighborhood, seem prefer rural areas exurbs, covid restrictions ignored vaccinations warmly accepted. Pfizer recommends least week second shot. I‚Äôve looking UK it‚Äôs going weeks

How long happens Canada USA?  started premise head thinking pandemic ""is over"" bad thing, interpreted persons reasons seems justifying think bad idea.  


It's good thing pandemic over. good thing people returning normal. bad thing many people refuse participate keeping virus going, keeping dangerous lot people. matter liberal friends can't responsibility stay state ""pandemic mode"" neighbors spooked get vaccine.  Oh it‚Äôs referring adults vs general population, 58% adults 55% general population (not sure numbers exactly correct I‚Äôm interpreting numbers LOL) frustrating part anti-vaxxers understand: COVID unfeeling, uncaring, numbers game. 

Their claim getting vaccinated hurt anyone else wrong, every unvaccinated body another potential host coronavirus mutate. Enough bodies, we're eventually going something pop able defeat current vaccinations available - we're back square one, may dealing variant higher R0 fatality rate.

Epidemiology work selfish people. fail consider numbers we're looking entire populations. Much like lottery, individual changes winning low, enough people playing, someone eventually wins...or case, loses everyone. Even something theoretically ""low"" 0.5% fatality rate would mean 1.6 million deaths country population US. may dies, going whole lot someone's make statistic. seems healthy risk trade-off.

In country that's rich enough secure access vaccines risk COVID nearly zero, even 1 250,000 risk severe side effects could outweigh dangers waiting another couple months max protected.

In country infection rate higher, however, AstraZeneca well worth it. crazy stay unprotected crisis slight risk VITT.

Cambridge broke risks (albeit much higher infection rates; even ""low exposure risk"" case hundreds times higher Australia):  vaccine either ""works"" ""doesn't work"". vaccines efficacy 0% 100%. clear scientific evidence vaccines less effective variants, vaccines working well used to. Free get sick die. 

In general, I'm familiar snowbirds New York New Jersey nearby states going Florida (and Texas), insane reason go Florida (a state serious interest ever visiting again). I‚Äôm Austin, TX. We‚Äôve back normal since April. numbers dropping. We‚Äôre 51% fully vaccinated. point, people refuse get vaccinated ones coming hospitals. run remorse because.... way prevent literally millions people proven effective hope people say waiting ""Full FDA Approval"" actually finally happens.

I'm also curious see happens military starts enforcing it. health anxiety, figured risk covid outweighed fear rare clotting occurrence. (Yes, know part health anxiety person thinks rare case THEM. That‚Äôs it‚Äôs anxiety lol.) thinks calm place, hope realizes benefits getting vaccine. shame, sputnik effective vaccine, although low supply component secound dose generate issues. Since least end days Gerorge W. Bush administration (at least noticed it), 20-30% population seem latch stupidest idea possible? Probably 10% negationists answered ""they never changed!"" thinking clever comeback 1% redditors never went outside homes anyway. It‚Äôs pessimistic - depend son mean ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù

We discussions work going change things long term - fewer people office, shaking hands, etc. 

If ‚Äúnormal‚Äù mean ‚Äúexactly things COVID,‚Äù no, many people, things never return normal. 

My wife several long discussions pandemic lockdowns changed perspective life - locked country strict 14 months (didn‚Äôt even take food).

The faulty/fragile nature supply chain US revealed - able get toilet paper, meat, skyrocketing lumber prices, unavailability ammunition rifles, etc. etc. eye opening. 

Two major things changed us:

Being prepared next time something like happened. could live good 6 months without visit grocery store. two weeks water. We‚Äôre getting whole house generator water purifying system. fully believe things like pandemic, heat wave Pacific Northwest, loss power Texas winter, etc. going become common climate change worsens don‚Äôt believe depend government decaying infrastructure deal it. pandemic highlighted us.

We going live life like next year could another lockdown. We‚Äôve tried travel another country least year we‚Äôre going try ramp things like live concerts. I‚Äôm also looking achieve financial independence retire early enjoy much life without incredibly stressful job (I‚Äôm 50‚Äôs).

So, me, would say life never going ‚Äúreturn normal‚Äù think lot positive - self-sufficiency focus making life live freely. They're important though. 

If question is, ""How concerned cases rising vaccinated communities?"", important know percent cases vaccinated people result hospitalization. 

On given day 93% less likely hospitalized vaccinated. COVID decline disappear finite time, 93% encouraging. 
But COVID able survive even vaccinated community, cases rising, strategy accept new reality, 77.5% going start seem relevant. Maybe I'm pessimist, seem pretty open interpretation article.

Respectfully, showed poll graph/question actually measures optimism. 

It‚Äôs 89%.

That said, yeah, ya may disappointed people‚Äôs perspective ‚Äúnormalcy‚Äù moment, question wasn‚Äôt written gauge pessimism. was, would say question. ;) 3 10 probably never thought problem begin appears also depend whether you‚Äôre exposed new strain relative original infection isn‚Äôt shocking really. Articles im reading indicate really strong immune response get vaccinated previously infected great  30% call ""a minority"". vaccines referring to? widespread distribution completed human trials except young children. 

It seems like primary question largely rhetorical I‚Äôll leave be. impression Japanese govt want take L costs way go forward That‚Äôs true Working home, flexible reduced work schedules, curbside pickup (omg GODSEND, order groceries, pick up, still able put away! pass line!), stronger safety net I‚Äôm ever incapable working, stigmatizing young people need mobility aids ‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs lot.  Vegas past weekend. Saturday night packed house Bill Burr. Friday night packed house Cirque de Soleil show. vaccinated, pandemic over. Yeah, optimal would include wearing mask right. I've also encouraged everyone get mixed results. 8 man team employ I'm one vaccinated. Two got hit last year think they're immune. 

Luckily wife, mom, grandma local friends gotten theirs. Best hope country days. :( no, new babies born aren‚Äôt vaccinated born much faster anyone dies covid  refusal generally response seems Hegelian dialectic.

Masks clearly prevent transmission virus. Vaccine prevent transmission virus. I‚Äôm speaking either rather commenting folks seem hone notions they‚Äôre confirmed solutions got best answers question could gotten subreddit went way tell people rejected answers, clearly nothing anyone said going change mind  Right. even I'm guilty put spin it, I'm realizing problem open-ended question is. won't. store past weekend people mask vaccinations rate good 100%.  That's pretty much I'm right now. I'm vaxxed live highly vaxxed area. still cases course, point start living? 0 cases? That's never ever going happen. country least recommend people Covid get one time vaccinated mRNA vaccine 6 months later healthy bolster immune system. seems going though illness alone good prevention another infection compared people got vaccinated. FDA gives Novavax EUA, vaccination percentage probably go even more.  I've never sub. thread serious, sarcastic comment? I'm serious science... natural selection choose mutations thrive, soon mutation born (in unvaccinated person, since statistically happen) breakthrough vaccinated immunity, we're toast. long huge population unvaccinated people, happen eventually. don‚Äôt think UK anywhere close 88% *adults* fully vaccinated, never mind 88% people. see we‚Äôre 86% 1 dose, means September we‚Äôll around 86% adults fully vaccinated, that‚Äôs 86% population, matters herd immunity. first shot, mild soreness set couple new personal records weight lifting. second shot, arm slightly sore day, lifted get extra five pounds hoping for. horror! said soreness went away day. girlfriend said moderately sore two days. Isn‚Äôt 30% unvaxxed number?  Certainly. reasonable argument interpretation.  


Maybe problem vague poll question seems first place. It‚Äôs understanding Australia almost immunity vaccines natural immunity prior infections, make concerned going forward. Thanksgiving would telling fall mainly indoors compared 4th July summer mainly outdoors well thinking life wont also means know someone/family died life also mean damage covid taking care someone covid damage. know breathing way worse september, run decently enough comes swimming get breath one lap Based what? Comparing drunk driving wildly offensive basically every level one shifts hybrid WFH schedule available pandemic, returning ""normal""? USA population: 332,500,000

COVID deaths USA far: 606,000

Percent people killed COVID USA: unvaccinated dying.

It's plausible enough people die statistically significant impact %vaccinated. 60% current population become fully vaccinated COVID death count doubled 1,212,000 additional COVID deaths among unvaccinated, fully vaccination rate would 60.1%. that's deaths births. 

Currently birth death rates higher COVID death rate effect would even smaller. It‚Äôs weirdly non-specific question though. see someone thinking ‚Äúwell I‚Äôll probably wear mask every fall guess it‚Äôll never normal again‚Ä¶‚Äù therefore they‚Äôd say yes question even though that‚Äôs hardly pessimistic. came specifically argue, probably someone confused concept exponential growth thinks predictions new wave come true like 3 times row people hypochondriacs  I've already lost trust friends feel. cobbled together childcare son premie childcare advised also none area taking kids due limiting class sizes. I'm pretty much mental breaking point. lot friends anti vaccine anti mask both. one met child pretty much told thia undoing. Sucks. We've discussed moving past family loves snow activities, considering real. Hang there. new mom hard...being nee mom pandemic worse. That's actually stellar. ""Escape"" really right word here. Efficacy numbers revolve around whether get infected again. vaccines still allow body mount better immune response, even get infected, odds getting hospitalized drop dramatically compared unvaccinated. end day, we're trying prevent deaths hospitalizations.  Maybe I'm pessimist, seem pretty open interpretation article. Even says ""In addition 15% U.S. adults say lives already completely back normal, 46% think lives eventually be. However, 40% Americans expect lives ever return entirely normal existed prior pandemic."" 


Maybe gets clich√© ""new normal"" gets floated often, meant along lines Thomas Wolfe saying ""You never go home again""  Delta fall gonna ruin illusions. Wow salty... asks something gets demonised. ""40% expect lives ever normal again""

I think mean is, things never go back life 2019. experienced huge shift due pandemic. lot jobs lost, working home became pretty popular, etc. terms, life never again, ""normal"" 2019 terms. new normal, nothing wrong that, per se. think vaccine fully FDA approved people get it.. excuse hear most. risk dying covid without comorbidities 40 low. Getting stuck lightning low. gave older people risk dying much higher. video top: ‚ÄúI niece named Alicia works [at hospital] she‚Äôll come home she‚Äôll talk [COVID]. doesn‚Äôt really register it‚Äôs you. sudden it‚Äôs it‚Äôs like completely different.‚Äù

Some people really lack mental flexibility put someone else‚Äôs shoes imagine it‚Äôs like them. great example that. It‚Äôs mindset behind racism, sexism, homophobia, nationalism, general callousness peoples suffering.  Good know. wonder far efficacy rate drops variants. friend group I'm one thinks still going on. husband thinks cause already Christmas means dont need vaccinated. intend getting I've recovered surgeries.   anyone survey asked me, yes, would say it‚Äôs over, I‚Äôve sporting events full capacity, don‚Äôt wear mask anywhere, don‚Äôt see anyone else wearing one either (except food service workers old young people). 

I know people hate flu analogy, flu still goes around, nobody talks ‚Äúflu pandemic‚Äù way, constantly mutating newer infectious variants way, also kills thousands years. Corona isn‚Äôt going go away foreseeable future, it‚Äôs already become mitigated degree longer pandemic It‚Äôs till small businesses statues destroyed   Go to:

Edit unfortunately worldometers hospital #s. talking vacations. 2 kids work, average, 60 hours/week, often including weekends. average, employed Americans work around 35 hours/week. people might actually difficulty multiple jobholders, make around 5-7% workforce.

Compare months elevated heartbeat (read: heart struggling provide oxygen rest body), choice no-brainer. That's having, despite vaccinated.   Hm, north border vaccinate teenagers school, seems pretty common sense/easy. 12-17 numbers substantially higher 18-29 group (which least vaccinated age group still better overall US average rate). Oh no

Anyway‚Ä¶ First it‚Äôs April study published May 6, article picked late May. That‚Äôs pretty critical info: all, that‚Äôs 2 separate thoughts. access vaccines can‚Äôt get work totally different worried missing work due vaccine. 

I‚Äôm trying build narrative trying understand reasons people don‚Äôt want it. well paying job worried missing time due Covid vaccine. Doesn‚Äôt indicate don‚Äôt access slave wage job. Lol internet definitely us though France outside mask mandate curfew couple weeks ago. far know European countries similar restrictions June. you‚Äôre saying work one job, kids, afford take time off, job would let take time off.  What? told suppository. Wtf normal!  France one cautious countries Europe regards covid

Also France : ""Masks useless"".

You smoking good stuff man. Since pandemic, gotten sick allergies even once, lol.

No allergy pills, cold/flu medicine, codeine doctor. routine check things.

I'm tempted get bidet use toilet paper dry. Everyone vaccinated country? cases sniffles, one hospitals, cases increasing? That‚Äôs fantastic you. Edit add: world including entire continents aren‚Äôt point yet. would Kaiser Permanente study late May, far June survey. ‚Äúgood chunk‚Äù 48% worried missing work due vaccine side effects. doesn‚Äôt fit narrative you‚Äôve built up, guess?  think aware that. Thankfully longer issue her. least, now. Yeesh, like saying, people likely notice complain. people 40 double dosed then. vaccine works delta variant, worried? blame Japan . They've sitting stuff months . vaccines good enough nothing be.

Restrictions be. last 5000+ years.  Anyone US wants vaccinated, vaccinated.

But, see squirrel corpse (and possible blood smear) remains near road. applies viruses; virus dies surface (as I've heard SARS-CoV-2 tends do), able infect anything, still detect remains look carefully enough.

It looks like study done US Delta became widespread here.

The Israeli study Delta. Yeah basically. think concept looking ""evolutionary pressure""; Since variants go around vaccines much successful don't, adaptations ""pushed"" pressure create. see many things too; bacterial resistance antibiotics, small fish thrown back fishers resulting smaller adult fish. 

Still, virus adapted one type vaccine adapted them, ""adapted"" mean vaccine impact them. spike protein primarily targeted vaccines, thing, multiple layers defence stacked top one another. arms race, humans nowhere near done yet. Yes, not? 
And rest world back normal time soon. people seen families almost two years

It even close two years, unless talking China approaching 1 1/2 years. Quarantines travel restrictions start March April 2020. Well, currently pay (because everyone does). removal obligation get vaccinated, rather creation obligation don't.

I think there'll little sympathy 85%+ get vaccinated minority don't. overzealous. NZ bit nanny state like Australia. could force people wear helmets driving would.

Yeah that's fair!  That‚Äôs fake. point trying make completely ruined fact condescending ass.  Well aren‚Äôt school aged probably isn‚Äôt huge deal. great news tho. Whilst I‚Äôm entirely sure wording poster replied using, understand agree sentiment.

We‚Äôre reaching point U.K. think learning live right course action. early drop legal mandates? Yeah, think personally. think waiting start August get another month vaccinations belt. are. 

I think it‚Äôs right transition new phase everyone taking responsibility now. legal mandates going‚Ä¶ still works keep loved ones safe. I‚Äôm 30 double vaxxed. parents, grandparents, almost extended family members, friends work colleagues. Everyone else personally know care single dosed expecting second next month so. They‚Äôre also smart, decent people, won‚Äôt knowingly put people risk, still follow self-imposed mask wearing restrictions. I‚Äôve discussions, trust them.

What else do? NEVER try get back normal COVID isn‚Äôt going go away, people won‚Äôt can‚Äôt get vaccinated need constantly live fear? Vaccines shown clear weakening hospitalisation deaths current strains circulation. That‚Äôs point them; eradicate it, save everyone. course might change new strain wholeheartedly agree go back legal mandates killer strain negates vaccines.

And point around flu, whilst feel like ramifications COVID greater flu human beings, understand point. Flu circulates every year kill people. New strains develop, new vaccines brought out, people still die. Vaccinated not, there‚Äôs death. get flu vaccine every year (although flu fucking awful!), protect parents grandparents, others, don‚Äôt want spread it. get population good state ‚Äòhandle‚Äô COVID there‚Äôs immunity enough people, boosters enough need it, keep hospitalisations deaths down. people still die. That‚Äôs awful, it‚Äôs life, right? 

If it‚Äôs thousand, doesn‚Äôt stray far typical flu deaths winter, really something need continually shut lives for? Maybe become norm see x% deaths every winter flu+COVID complications?

Anyway, loved ones keep safe, keep right you. may law much longer, there‚Äôs decent people still want protect others much themselves!  45 days EVERYONE wearing masks, leaving house reason, getting people sick. 

So travel, anything‚Ä¶

Like that‚Äôs ever going happen. Eh, fuck ‚Äòem vaccines start losing effectiveness major news. many articles cases deaths unvaccinated. keep checking here. People already concerned delta variant. Anybody knows website chart variants stacked top other? chart shows covid variants country. lost link. uk cases high pick date centre, send sms hour, get get, picking vaccine get.

We something similar Poland although think appointment finder website lets pick vaccine want look may like results centers may desired vaccine.  Risk assessment personal. rather annoying everyone always either attempts shoehorn everything binary state (you either scared poopless over). zero appreciation fact we're different OK somewhat different risk assessment. play on, well funded operation warp speed Republican/Trump, getting shot letting Democrats win. main goal keep ICU occupancy manageable, currently case. also see would change near future (vaccinations + summer).

Yea, people die. Hopefully trigger people get vaccinated. Yep meant say 1.  tens thousands people. It‚Äôs possible. fire enough bullets, gotta kill least one virus. Yes that‚Äôs meant, thanks. No, don‚Äôt deploy grunts fight Covid. 

They send military doctors military nurses failing hospitals, equal vaccine uptake civilian peers.

You aware DoD runs one largest hospital networks world right? Probably not.

Yes, fist, heart, that‚Äôs whole reason hospital ships. Giant, floating, goodwill amazing doctors nurses happen military.   evidence happening yet even delta variant vaccine still works. something comes changes course, however continue live life unaltered. Darwin I've worked home since around 5th March last year, pretty neat life kids got easier neither wife could stop commuting think misconception ""gods will"" means. Gods basically another wording gods rules. ""will"" people try follow ""good person"". Hence following quote ""I desire will, God; law within heart."" . Yes there's gods will, God gives choice act wills free given people (if christian whatever). Like who? nobody risky get shot. people really can't get allergic ingredients rare medical exemptions. Especially since multiple vaccines (if mRNA vaccines issue, someone get J&amp;J vaccine). People underlying medical conditions actually need anyone else reason getting them. 

The main group people concerned got first mRNA vaccine allergic severe reactions get second. protocol place point get different vaccine.

There also many people get shot(s) effective less effective, including immunocompromised people, immunosuppressants, weak immune systems.

But thing exactly everyone ELSE needs get shot. reasons people say getting vaccine personal choice really personal choice.

But people hospitalized and/or dying covid, vast vast vast majority chose get vaccinated. always small percentage people got vaccine ineffective. perhaps get first place (but probably unlikely given multiple vaccines underlying conditions would still get vaccinated).  dont think 0% anywhere vaccinated ppl

I'd rather take .8% chance try gambling 99.2%. recent covid deaths vaccinated people, 99.2% deaths unvaccinated people.

If give cause concern think anything will. 99.2% unvaccinated people dying thing...  Yup. issue lockdowns beginning. inevitably next couple years.  Short version? still catch transmit. get hammered hard continue pass along helping stay alive long enough mutate (think delta variant) something worse. 

I'm longer wearing mask days since I've gotten shots cdc says longer necessary.  I'm delusion, however, I'm optimal. no. like vaccinating health care workers, kids gonna contact really high risk population. one way out. Full vaccination. idiot country decided way out. fun locking repetitively months end next 2-3 years. Could imagine showing comments, context, people last year? would seen madness is. feel bad people kids 12 want vaccinated.

Thanks. person situation I'm watching Pfizer Moderna clinical trials closely possible day get EUA 12 I'll start making appointments. another country trust somehow beats us punch, I'd even consider buying plane tickets two weekend trips get done. Damn, that's really good point think I've seen brought before: people think ""who cares antivaxxers?"", happens fill hospitals vaccinated people unable get seen heart attacks, cancer checks, surgeries, etc? get sick things COVID still completely screwed due antivaxxers. idiocy *can* still negatively affect others. Yeah never would spent travel Olympics year. could see coming long way back. didn't, implied based comment chain reads. Oh no. She‚Äôs wrong. takes couple weeks become fully magnetic.  know process works, lack planning looking start trials open schools.  know living america done me? first thought ""those poor people can't get vaccinated going die horribly that's awful"" ""man hope means get couple rounds stimulus bills pay"" specifically said group suffering.

The point paper linked (and vast majority research long covid) control group. say compare group who's infected group - without comparison zero way determine prevalent issue is.

Your allergy example exactly I'm talking about, actually. Someone covid definitely experience symptoms allergies, *so someone has* previously infected. background rates symptoms, can't say due covid.

Let's look insomnia. agree portion people covid experiencing insomnia, right? Let's say 10% people normally experience insomnia (made numbers) 12% people prior covid infection experience it. say covid causes insomnia 12% people, 10% would regardless infection. reality, based numbers, covid causes insomnia 2% people. can't attribute everything happens covid virus - that's control group for. trying accelerate vaccination lot. aim given days ago vaccinate 1.7 million (first second, dose) people 2 weeks, next. 17% 10 million population. Things obviously bit chaotic right now, whole staff vaccination centres health centres heroes.

BTW way goes, vaccination centres got one doctor staff plus nurses obviously. patient mentions conditions questions consult doctor - small villages towns likely familiar doctor health centre. Shot, patient waits thirty minutes waiting room symptoms it. Second shot, exactly 4 weeks later (or 8, AZ). Geez, people need invest actual personalities beyond Covid prevention absolutely cost. agree quote reasoning behind it. stated article, estimated 7 million people health issues able go hospital it. nuts long maybe extend lives unvaccinated elderly years, right? cares actual real, quantified, massive health threat face *extremely* remote possibility vaccine resistant strain even article admitted displayed actual signs it‚Äôs happening happen?

You people really need grow up. world calculated risk balancing things. health 7 million people means nothing you, though, face tradeoff deaths already frail elderly popular, right? presented big boy scenario, slap table throw tantrum it‚Äôs inconceivable don‚Äôt live gumdrop land everything always wraps perfectly. I‚Äôm saying, two years ago viewpoints would seen are: madness.

In conclusion, I‚Äôm glad guy seems actually talking sense. statement it‚Äôs healthy *only* think Covid offensive you, advise get actual personality. get reason, allowed eat co-workers would suck Masks work (ignore Fauci‚Äôs carefully worded denial last year), can‚Äôt vulnerable, need everybody, providing physical barrier output intake virus. Especially given higher transmission rates Delta versus vaccinated individuals, everybody‚Äôs interest. R0 Delta variant 6! vaccines still effective preventing serious illness, hospitalization, death, doesn‚Äôt help kids people can‚Äôt vaccinated. 

We could wear masks shutdowns, rolling shutdowns waves illness death. Choosing masks choosing future shutdowns way slow spread. Go CDC symptoms Natural selection, fuck yeah!!! would think people moving state, Elon Musk etc, increased percentage vaccinated. Fascinating. Remember debates VP candidate said wouldn‚Äôt take vax. Watch tape. tables turned.  go live life. Don‚Äôt worry two week thing. It‚Äôs extra precautionary 2 weeks used it‚Äôs easy remember b Obviously. Cases bottoming out. Deaths basically gone we've vaccinated vulnerable people. Missourian here. Evangelicals utterly ruined state. Thanks covidiots antivaxers New Zealanders were, last time heard, still *human.*  

This human problem, specifically *authoritarian* problem (or, want bit charitable, *control freak* problem). Yes, analogy may American, undoubtedly hundred analogies various countries cultures would fit. 

It boils to: *somebody charge instituted thing greater control; historically, humans wield power generally unwilling relinquish power without coercion, even original drivers action longer exist.* I'm pointing evangelical hypocrisy issue. That's I'm doing. wear mask fine symptom cold, COVID. highly doubt thing would ever implemented US 

My state -- happens Maryland -- responded question sent web portal, said plans create ""vaccine passport"". 

My *actual* question way load vaccine status Apple Wallet. reasoning is, can't expect never leave Maryland, reliable way vouch vaccine status (eventually) travel regions countries. Right now, though, can't find way prove got shot paper card gave FEMA-run site. Man, Vermont's numbers would enough make unmask finally. live hover ~50%. I'm fully vaxxed people disgusting, unvaccinated. mask stay get closer 70% numbers. Japan measures limit crowd sizes allowing international spectators, Delta raging, enough? 

I personally hate pressure IOC put Japan 80% population hosting Olympics year. risk athletes alone reason postpone again, let alone risk spectators even general population. 3/10 Americans fully vaccinated 

No, [**48% Americans fully Yeah, anyone thinks pandemic ignoring pandemic global phenomena. global basis, pandemic trending towards worst point yet rise delta variant tearing developing countries.

If fully vaccinated highly vaccinated jurisdiction, pandemic might currently feel over(ish) purely subjectively standpoint. claiming objectively truth. Natural selection Could start new variant? don‚Äôt know, wife spent months covid wards N95‚Äôs never caught CoVID-19. real replacement prevention exposure.

A cloth mask worn American barely bothered put on, yeah absolutely useless, there‚Äôs better option now. Cool Hospitals still getting packed unvaccinated sick people. It‚Äôs still public health concern can‚Äôt get hospital care unrelated emergencies don‚Äôt beds. yes suspect vaccine preventing illness thing proposed for.

*headdesk* Great, amazing, excellent.

I‚Äôm laughing point. Olympics event getting special treatment forced stay home, shut businesses etc. gov keeps wasting efforts greeds. It‚Äôs mistake, know doing. know decisions sacrifice lives. beyond tired bullshit. FUCK. YOU.  vaccinated feel like least far personally concerned....if didnt vaccination would definitely thinking that. Right, opens door businesses schools require vaccines, would push least get anyway. way instruct body's immune system easy non-invasive way... Bah, that's crazy talk...  It‚Äôs completely open here. need get vaccinated tested go bar without fixed seating example. Also need wear masks public transport places can‚Äôt keep 1.5 distance. Big events still forbidden. guess compared certain European countries it‚Äôs pretty open yes. got source that? highly unlikely afaik    what's really gonna happen worked EMS long time. Part mentality field trying decide thing going kill first. example, maybe got hit car eating hotdog. car broke femur, incredible pain. also threw heart rhythm cardiac arrest shortly nothing done it. Also, choking hotdog. 

So awfully unlucky scenario, issue going kill first. answer hotdog. Femur hurts like hell, eventually kill you, got ton time worry that. cardiac issue, that's much pressing, monitored, right now, alive. anything hotdog, dead next 2 minutes. Hotdog, heart, leg. 

You could take AZ vaccine, might get blood clot die, sure. still much likely catch COVID19 die. me, COVID likely kill me, I'll take chances blood clot. Docs treat that, watch warning signs, get help need it. sports village isn‚Äôt opened yet. Athletes training camps Japan village.  Germany numbers slowly increasing well wouldn‚Äôt be?

Honestly yeah, I'm kind surprised well. far I'm concerned I'm vaccinated wear mask, over.

Hi fellow New Englander! Similar spot CT, thankfully ‚ò∫ I‚Äôm going argue you. nice day. Let‚Äôs clear 30 percent think pandemic yet don‚Äôt see single mask anywhere public since mask mandate lifted. things don‚Äôt match   shown people vaccinated, please spread misinformation. conspiracy fantasists say videos staged labels doctors nurses actors. anyone know release stats vaccinated vs unvaccinated?    prime minister pledged scrap England's coronavirus regulations step four roadmap lockdown, expected 19 means government braced surge coronavirus cases, possibly around 100,000 day, restrictions lifted. feel 100%. second Moderna shot kicked ass. Felt like death. familiar church camps, know many attendees kids 12? 18-59 also first three priority groups. go age. Younger people illnesses people certain jobs bunch reasons could also get vaccinated sooner. Also younger people without risk factors could get vaccinated earlier decided get AstraZeneca despite official recommendation age group Germany.

For AstraZeneca especially pushed 60-70 years old. best reputation Germany. surprise 60-70 years old rather decided wait longer could get Biontech Moderna. 

Also overall numbers still lower UK think mostly result lack vaccine last months. also explains different numbers first second doses. lot cases people get first shot super long ago. getting better easier make vaccination dates. Germany weeks behind UK.  Haha nice there‚Äôs Lambda variant. hope long term impact (health wise) infected. Vaccinated not.  MO ranks near bottom list vaccinations. bother trying help them. refuse principal.

Ok, bringing confuses issue. topic unvaccinated people, 0.01% unvaccinated people legit excuse.   Yes watching hospitalization crucial. thinking cases precede hospitalizations weeks, vaccinated people hospitalized way things stand now. Yeah. 26 reported deaths, 10 vaccinated. total, 90% Indonesian health workers vaccinated, i.e. 9:1 split vaccinated/unvaccinated healthcare workers. means Sinovac (1 - 10/144) * 100 = 93% effective reducing deaths.

Wont hospitalizations deaths go usual time lag cases? Isn‚Äôt happening Springfield Missouri? 

Is idea everything good long doesn‚Äôt happen? makes sense me. States high levels vaccinations won‚Äôt see happen. 

People still concerned new variants due high transmission, infection worldwide, creating brand new variants doesn‚Äôt seem like US biggest concern right now.  seems might unlikely. virus mutates far enough evade vaccines, also means trouble attaching cells thus able infect us more. many ways mutate way beneficial it. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Different doesn‚Äôt mean bad. 

A lot people realized commutes aren‚Äôt necessary worth it. Lots people spent time family realized don‚Äôt want stop that. Lots people found new jobs don‚Äôt want go back old ones. People kids, people lost family members. People got married, people got divorced.

The real question many people think world go back time. never before, there‚Äôs precedent it.

Time moves forward. People too. Willingly not. months 2022. much closer 2019.

Those people think life go back really need get help. That‚Äôs time life works. Cases can't keep going forever. fresh hell this?

Give everyone vaccinated $200 probably 2/10 think never one begin with, hoax. understand type reaction/mindset,. one remember that:... ""There's timeline."" (IE = like ""Building House"" there's clear indicator Finish Line is."" 

That's argument say ""live fear forever"" (because would never argue that).. change objective reality simply cannot know future. 

Human hubris is... could stop wearing masks,. day week(s) Month new Variant etc come ridiculously high kill-percentage. 

Remember Covid19 first started.. ""4 14 days"" ahead us (invisibly) people could transmissive without even knowing it. 

There's nothing stopping happening again. ;) talking

The point remains studies like extremely limited usefulness, especially point plenty seem say happening *some* degree way conclude degree is. agree control important, I'm glad see that, think pretty irresponsible go around quoting numbers like mean something right now, don't. Uk can‚Äôt get 18s
And schools back full time remove restrictions won‚Äôt end well  Lol becoming like India. government learn shit happened India. people learn shit happened India.

I guess reaping sow. Fourth week lockdown counting behalf. There‚Äôs reason health officials saying vaccinated people still masking well

Some. There's longer consensus way used be.  know ventilator used *only* patient cannot breathe adequately supply oxygen, right? meds speak administered ventilation hopes virus subside enough patient self-sufficient. ‚Ä¢ 40% expect lives ever normal again

Thats fucking sad. This‚Ä¶ factual. Period. Pfizer guaranteed deliver 20 million backloaded end year, always deliver. Moderna promised 15 million, pretty good meeting deadlines even doesn‚Äôt get beginning. Maybe government slow roll vaccines there, enough vaccinate remaining Australian adults. 

This doesn‚Äôt even count 20 million Pfizer nearly finish October AZ many millennials taking since worried Pfizer supply. 

I swear y‚Äôall want shit Australia don‚Äôt read news. live. We're back school weeks. estimated 64% France's adult population received least one coronavirus vaccine dose, 46% fully vaccinated, according government data.

I hope vaccination numbers go months ahead. France got hit hard. 110k lives lost far. lost lot hope seeing many people truly care others. caused jaded struggle massive amounts social anxiety can't stop thinking selfish people are. know dramatic feel.

Because supply issues. EVEYRYTHING delivered used week delivery. 30 million people want vaccines 4 millions doses available week months people able get vaccinated.

Doesn't matter distribution method centers, GPs Santa Claus. construction site inspecting longer required masks since equipment wear heat didn‚Äôt wear mask first time public‚Ä¶ wouldn‚Äôt know got cold right away‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm going miss everyone wearing masks norm.  like AIDS pandemic forever.

Source: Empirical Reality country suffer vast anti vax propaganda news org pumping lies 24/7 like US? Ah okay care others around you, gotcha. There‚Äôs guarantee TSA won‚Äôt extend mask mandates past 9/13. may extend since we‚Äôve got extremely contagious variants millions children still won‚Äôt vaccinated. really don‚Äôt understand masks helping don‚Äôt anything else say you. Enjoy flight. Yep. see shift.

The ""other community"" similarly radicalizing moderates drop off. actually debating flat earth theory day. still wear mask even though I'm vaccinated keep hands clean. Less likely get illnesses well. scared, know people nasty  Yeah seems likely. Amazing since Boris hospitalized it. Ultimately machine must fed, regardless. good analogy belive natural immunity better vaccine  vaccines specially made tested use animals. approved use humans. company made donating zoos. That's true all, people wear mask public transportation. Sometimes badly, yes, really see people without masks subway. think there‚Äôs gap people doing, believe. pandemic US? Probably not, it‚Äôs getting close. 

Are behaving like it‚Äôs over? bet. don‚Äôt see problem vaccinated. I‚Äôm area 70% vaccinated, I‚Äôm vaccinated, whole social group is. We‚Äôve almost nonstop partying. me, personally, pandemic over, asked I‚Äôd probably say it‚Äôs America whole though. Yeah, true. CFR lot room error considering number cases probably go undetected. tough guess true number infections might area went confirmed cases. CFR usually trotted fear-mongering purposes trying go it. Ok stay inside want  Delta 0% hospitalizations Corona 0% deaths.  sounds like blanket plan exclude unvaccinated I'm worried people still unvaccinated U.S. anymore. damn fault get hospitalized point. long vaccine keeps reported effective said variants, we're good. Covid virus disease there. I'm vaccinated im returning back 2019. everyone's goal. hope so. We're - getting vaccinated encouraging many people likewise so. Vaccination orders magnitude effective helping protect anything else could do. large percentage people go get vaccinated orders magnitude dangerous anything could do. Covid's gonna keep spreading enough vaccinations plus infections stamp out. seeing vaccinations, we're gonna see infections. Anything reduce spread outside vaccination slow rate infections happen without reducing many infections eventually happen- we'll get amount infections, amount risk, spread longer period time. People get vaccinated need get vaccinated. That's matters point. daughter‚Äôs pediatrician said specialists children‚Äôs hospital area impossible get appointments filled children effects covid. don‚Äôt really care honest. I‚Äôm vaccinated. that, meh. like 99% TSA, Department Transportation.

Compliance certainly dropping remains substantial. all-or-nothing game.  Even little bit compliance helps.

September 13th special, pick day it, day come significantly need actually passed safety margin.  Good I'm wondering portion people experience repeat symptoms, actually getting infected someone else? words, understand symptoms dormant people infected, someone infected, say 3 months ago, makes contact someone becomes infected due contact.
I suppose could say similar flu, couple years ago get thanks contact, believe flu dormant people? Nah ... would simple ""Another stimulus check qualified last one reach 80% fully vaccinated x date"".  daughter‚Äôs pediatrician said it‚Äôs almost impossible get specialist appointments local Children‚Äôs Hospital. many kids getting side effects covid doctors slammed. Death isn‚Äôt thing worried comes covid. me, don‚Äôt want daughter injured fault can‚Äôt understand, effects covid entire life, we‚Äôll keep wearing masks (mine solidarity), she‚Äôs vaccinated.  anyone gives shit (in America). sympathy choose vaccinate. scary unvaccinated getting covid? country europe (nl) children age group didnt get chance vaccinate yet. mild infection carries risk People may thought disingenuous.  Yes understand, referring Christian Scientists Mary Baker Eddy sense. don‚Äôt know many, ones got vaxxed. know of. 61 deaths county looking online, looking would never even hear mentioned work/out people. I‚Äôm also younger guy lives alone work office 3 people big concern us. office too, 80 acre lot far away homes/businesses. 1 1 Delta variants say not. wear mask little longer

I‚Äôd rather not. I‚Äôm sorry hear scenario kids guys afraid catching covid, put N95‚Äôs call day. isn‚Äôt world‚Äôs responsibility protect guys, especially us vaccinated. time drop it, kids won‚Äôt even chance fully vaccinated anyhow I‚Äôm seeing helping Personally think inetivable daily infections going rise point. whole goal ICs overloaded likely happen fast since pointed people generally get less sick. completely responsibility whether want go stuff imo. still isolate afraid get sick. fuck whole event testing people 14 days since gotten vaccination could still make QR code it. rollout really bad. well places straight checking. infections probably happen clubs bars rather festivals generally get monitored better outside lots times. Pfft believe birds? That's use averages.  And, average number doses administered, CDC's data, one million per day (967k) since June 12th. Pfizer expects submit application around September. precise timing unknown depends certain number people control group getting sick naturally.

But expect convince many people. always soon, experimental, scary, suspicious. second daughter hits two weeks second vaccine (which she‚Äôs 3, isn‚Äôt time soon), start consider pandemic could ending, Republican state, though like pretend it‚Äôs over, there‚Äôs end sight.  160 people infected, six (about 3.7%) vaccinated

So yeah lets send kids camp pretend delta varant covid gone now. could possibly go wrong? DUH! Yep, cows considered sacred religion apparently shit cure covid. Watch video must, really wish mud. That's wild big spread state state, aware that. almost certainly right, then, overall difference states grow. It‚Äôs really interesting people react vaccines. cousin husband floored shingles shot. partner felt little tired headachey day. don‚Äôt know age matters - 10 years younger are. totally understand people tired masks. Especially vaccinated. I‚Äôm tired haven‚Äôt worn one quite time area good vaccination rates low Covid cases. I‚Äôm getting ready fly across entire United States Friday dread hours wear one. 

However, I‚Äôm also flying two children age 12 can‚Äôt vaccinated. Driving isn‚Äôt option trip planned since Covid. parent, I‚Äôm personally glad TSA mask mandate place everyone vaccinated I‚Äôm willing deal mask wearing know kids safe. 

I realize many skirt rules like mentioned would ask please consider young kids flying wear mask little longer. frustrated assholes won‚Äôt get vaccinate mask mandates. Nope. Let 'em enjoy deserve. Good points. personally believe there‚Äôs much media world thanks internet. People personalized bubbles every one truly think free thinkers.

Even best media outlets struggle good journalism speaks everyone regardless are. general public divided even dumb ‚Äúis covid vaccine safe‚Äù. don‚Äôt know break personal bubbles future sounds scary way things going. state nowhere near that. 40% people vaccinated. We‚Äôve got higher covid numbers 4 months ago. Yet, isn‚Äôt single mask sight. makes angry think people wearing masks actually vaccinated- plus none kids wearing masks, definitely aren‚Äôt vaccinated. daughter (who isn‚Äôt vaccinated, obviously), (in solidarity) usually ones wearing them.   parents awesome getting vaccinated low vaccinated area.. Hope get well soon..sending positive energy.  call ""birds &amp; bees""? Anti mask sentiment finest. inconveniences ‚Äúme‚Äù let‚Äôs put people risk. entire world wearing masks work.

Vermont, 66% 12-17-year-olds least one shot, Mississippi 11%.

I think see spike vaccinations west coast, northeastern, mid-Atlantic states opened younger kids, much increase parts country. geographic disparities vaccination rates grow even larger now. friends got JJ aside arm soreness tiredness fine. Funny works. Compared population it‚Äôs less. Thanks service Exactly. 30% never cared all. issue. can't get vaxed... fuck right : p point take burden { Bring able think one, 1st Amendment right} person place society....

Good bot! 3 10 believe over, 2 10 believe never pandemic begin with. Gonna need sizable school districts mandating vaccination school boards maintaining spines face resistance. *you* it‚Äôs incredibly silly. people, it‚Äôs large inconvenience.

My initial point they‚Äôre becoming enough inconvenience many spark issues. point pandemic, need choice. Airplanes also aren‚Äôt nearly deadly covid wise people make think point. people eligible get vaccinate got would hell lot closer over, least us Definitely part problem then. getting tested day leave go house one friends owns belgian/french border region ardennes spend relatively chill vacation maybe go dinner go supermarket. also fully vaccinated covid well. 

But sure people like part problem. Lol.  Lotta people long covid instance, click 'View Historic Vaccination Data' button see 1,161,081 (328,809,470 7/2, 329,970,551 7/3) doses administered July 3rd.

That number administered July 3rd. That's number reported July 2nd (4pm ET, think) July 3rd. doses could days back weeks back. Yeah that's me. vaccine free widely accessible. Except small number people legitimately cannot get vaccine, fault. change someone else maliciously stupid asshole. Israeli info flawed best unknown begin since haven‚Äôt even released actual study hey did! least 7/10 us aren‚Äôt idiots. It‚Äôs incredibly silly someone choose drive flying dislike masks much. hey would assume Boris staff would discuss opening things via meeting? sure held, something like opening back up, surely 2 person. That's me. pay attention daily positivity numbers. We've 200 state bit, maybe 1 2 city day, I'm pretty comfortable going eat around lot people know. want travel Netherlands couple months get second shot. Hope covid levels acceptable level then. numbers accurate accurate. talking about.  ever big problem community? Like hospitals beds etc? isn‚Äôt really something concerned unless you‚Äôre severely immunocompromised illness chemo. Vaccines aren‚Äôt effective people category (but still help reduce severity!) case yes... talking ‚Ä∞ finite thing (like pie), no.

Feel free reply want break further. love math.  us could better spot. boy 120 countries much, much worse spot. Listen fully understand relentlessness past 18 months trying berate you. longer bearing life.

As long people remain unvaccinated, US half yet double jabbed, poses massive risk that's half population depend everything stocking shelves policing making sure water electricity flows. covid case occupies doctor, nurse, emt hospital bed might needed someone love something completely unrelated covid. people vaccinations spreading disease,

They far far less likely spread still people vaccinations typically succumbing disease

Yet still odds underlying conditions exist meeting vaccinated people significant chance impacting anyone negative way.

Absolutely try safest possible manner summer outdoors etc. I'm incredibly frightened newer variants appearing may robust vaccines moment world still middle this. like look like neighborhood fire houses devastated managed save belongings, houses fires still rage houses managed keep fire bay worry embers floating air risking house.

Fully vaccinated folks nothing worry That's realistic probably unattainable goal. many backwards small pockets around world. Someone's even whole countries. fully expect middle eastern countries remain mostly unvaccinated forever due cultural religious reasons (they'll come reason vaccinated, somewhere world). political maintain embargo. Even were, borders always remain porous. Travel continue. country world full travel lockdown ever successful long period time. 

More realistically, get manageable level roll boosters become necessary. Pfizer big names testing efficacy vaccines terms longevity immunization current strains effectivity developing strains exactly mind. point reference, RKI states order reasonably able fight Delta-driven fourth wave, country needs vaccinate 90% people 60, 85% 18-59 year-olds. main goal keep ICU occupancy manageable, currently case.

That approach. judging results definitely one least impact society. know they're relatives sounds like natural selection trying thing. Seychelles, Gibraltar places yes. existence vaccine fix anything. *People actually get vaccinated - them.* far enough people vaccinated worldwide. covid vaccines straight happily married, im gay miserable. saw article data around 69% can't remember released it. thought Singapore maybe I'm mistaken. I'll try find sub. nearly everyone vaccinated 

Only ~48% Americans fully vaccinated. contagious disease spread air (that rapidly mutates) also ""Your body, choice."" died vaccines readily available tho. Could give age range? experiencing too. party tolerance everybody Also keep mind 4/10 American adults children, many us still waiting kids able vaccinated things back normal, hopefully September last heard  deployed vaccines drop risk noticeable least 50%. mRNA viral vector ones much higher. reduction severe cases much higher too. 

Very people gotten twice don‚Äôt think 3. visited Florida ... never plan going back. see appeal, realize lower taxes big deal older people fixed incomes there's many downsides ranging weather (almost always hot) higher crime New York (yes, Florida's crime rate higher NY) climate change. Also, there's sense community ... endless sprawl. Every time virus infects new host, chance bad mutation increases. 

Plus, COVID long haulers definitely thing, even among never see doctor. 

The unexplainable urge let club owners make profit paid whole society dearly. guess define ""being normal again"" means. means life like pandemic never happened, see anyone could think would happen. honest see anyone think we'll anywhere near point. sign SARS-CoV-2 ever completely eliminated. become endemic continue mutate, like Flu, deal that. fact can't get 50% people vaccinated giving away free tell us that. system Germany similar describe, booking software overly complicated phone hotlines always busy. lot people gave waited policians finally send vaccines GPs. lot free testing sites closing pandemic = False. mean high vax rates coupled anti vax care enough get tested (of course exceptions) lot demand it. mean tested several times last year unless need offical record going spend time money st like walgreens something. see Amazon one like $40 take days submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* actually prefer eating alone desk browsing reddit anyway (which I'm right 10 years now). me. Unless family members can't get vaccinated there's really nothing there's major reason worry. Covid probably continue ravage conservative communities refuse vaccine honestly that's problem. practically begged get fucking vaccine. want consequences them. provide source crazy claim like surge likely always be. happens every year around time.

The ceiling cases hopefully limited, rates severe disease, fits normal seasonal epidemic pattern sorta back old old.  Interesting.
I think hypothesis/theory? vaccines sars-cov-2 reduce viral load supported evidence time. 

I would like see viral load lowered variants well. hope studied/researched thoroughly lots data gathered this. 

Two studies CDC uses evidence 'tiny viral load' people vaccinated pre prints. would like see peer reviewed published expertise analyze them. also 4 directly linked CDC document.  life extends people realize. actions lead spread. entire subset people cannot get vaccinated vaccine them.. people 13 years age.. think cut last vaccines authorized.

Our actions directly impact people. think anything could put jeopardy. Normal perfect ways pandemic allowed us see that. flexibility work home something many people see good fewer people commuting everyday better environment. people conscious health others also good. one wants pandemic continue would great people better social distancing possible, washing hands regularly, wearing masks (or better yet staying home) sick, maybe even generally wearing maks flu season least interacting vulnerable populations. lots lessons carry forward make things better post-pandemic pre-pamdemic. time us decide next normal strive make things better rather settle old status quo.  people get significant symptoms vaccines, they're basically 100% effective preventing death. basically tell need know. agree whatever, reality \~99% people need worry either unvaccinated (they worried anyway) part at-risk group. normal vaccinated people life changing danger rear view mirror. question whether anti-vaxxers breed new variant finds way around vaccines one crosses border. They‚Äôre gonna start offering prizes motivate reluctant vaccinated.

Maple syrup sweepstakes, come! People think difference two things, isn't. vaccinated mean things could herd immunity achieved. Personally feel like ""pandemic 2.0"" pandemic vaccinated. worry protection.

Delta variant like 3rd 4th variant media covering. Unless goes major mutation, vaccine, well mRNA one atleast I've gathered, still hold strong.

I'm worried people refuse get jab. die, die. I'm worried people countries can't get children. it‚Äôs really confusing. You‚Äôre saying vaccinated group efficacy measurement breakthrough cases exposed people. 

So we‚Äôre taking exposed people comparing unvaccinated exposed control group. doesn‚Äôt make intuitive sense. even mild cases cause long covid major organ damage Fully vaccinated immunosuppressed here. doubt father, medical condition, able get back ""normal"" lives time soon. give hobbies due risks. Expect eventually catch COVID-19 since cannot stay home ""hide"" bills/other obligations. guess vaccine put test then, really hope fail.  True, cases excellent contact tracing slow spread, states US 50% vaccination much worse shape.  Ironically, many citizens aren‚Äôt getting shots country done good job keeping cases low‚Äîthey feel it‚Äôs necessary. Depends live. many states lot people probably vaccinated. many teens young adults say vaccine side effects worth mild case covid (if even get first place) Ok, I'll listen:

What's death rate people 40 now, drive evolution? think eventually go away. Usually takes 1.5 2 years types viruses die out. That's happen Spanish Flu hundred years ago. 

I think unvaccinated people continue get sick die. Sad, true. 

Hell, couple friends vaccinated. really hope get sick, do, them. Delta plus ain‚Äôt airline seat don‚Äôt know single person died First currently getting infected end hospital 1 2 week - premature make statements that. addition, youngsters live vacuum, get others infected (when asymptomatic, they'll risk others second leave house shopping visits). Even 2 shots protection 100%, COVID spreads, vaccinated people risk seriously illness. lastly, virus runs rampant, higher risk new variants emerging. partially vaccinated people get infected, higher chances vaccine-evading strain due selection pressure. nah, i'm never forgiving people post-covid era made fully vaccinated requirement get Lamberts, would take week son get area fully vaccinated. food atmosphere good. waiting area could serve vaccination site, people willing. Hahahah twist logic different directions believe true. So? work, take sunk cost stop using it. even offered one first. Makes sense buy them. 

The CHO needs resign absolutely terrible judgement rationale. sub overwhelmingly belief COVID over, mass downvote anything suggests otherwise. Well gotta keep covid dollars coming in; one dies ""covid"" another Porsche! CDC politicians now? Australia, 5 9 states territories shut level last two weeks. 

But Australia, first real brush virus year half.

The 7% fully vaccinated, 30% first dose vaccination rate great, largely failure Prime Minister Scott Morrison secure vaccines countries need lot more, due unwillingness get vaccinated. eat outside like done last year half. think helps stick local numbers. Check local health district state medical website vaccination rates infection rates. gets hairy fast looking globally. Israel says Pfizer less effective delta, Canada says vaccines great variants, Australia new variant lambda. like everything else feel comfortable. I'm super cautious still mask fully vaccinated go dine movies every couple weeks still working home. Life scary hopeful yin yang. people Bondi Beach Centennial Park walking around without masks close contact others. Meanwhile Newcastle, 2 cases ever, everyone wearing mask despite included lockdown area. daughters friend parent pedetrician said lost much business kids aren‚Äôt getting sick anymore  We've never shut society like pandemic society soldiered on. need new normal. Vaccinate vulnerable move on. rest politics frankly horrifying. Mental health issues enduring memory unless draw line step past it.  felt UK stance two fold. 

1. accept covid us like flu yearly vaccinations vulnerable.
2. might shake sense saying want vaccine. instances super spreader event get sick ones vaccinated. Perhaps one two might die anti vaxers rethink. You‚Äôre going ok.
It‚Äôs extremely unlikely covid seriously harm you‚Äôre vaccinated. much pressing health concerns worthy attention people. *The Economist* special report where, using data Office National Statistics, estimated 1% UK's labour force rendered permanently unable work due COVID.

1% loss manpower single event - counting things like turnover, retirement, etc. - single year *huge*. threat dying suffocation motivation enough anyone instinct self-preservation get inoculated. Must terrifying die way. One city, Sydney, lockdown week half. hasnt Australia, even state. live Sydney, first lockdown past 12 months. expected continue next Friday.

Note, even though lockdown, still able go exercise, work (If unable work home) shop. yep got ;) saw brussels times jumped 'brussels' wife daughter sick last week. Daughter got fever 103 12. Got quick test longer test negative. First time since 2019 either sick. 2 sick entire year. get sick even though around them.  Speak yourself, I'm teradactyl. That‚Äôs saddest part. countries people would love get shot people refuse follow science. Bless may stay safe  CDC begin track breakthrough infections among vaccinated since delta spreading? Mutations also adapt natural immunity. That's get flu every year 

The mRNA vaccines are, far, better mutations natural immune response.

Your statements are... Irrelevant best.

Most symptoms infection immune system response. catch thing, might find steroids suppress immune system.

Guess vaccine side effects are? immune system. Immunosuppressants, like ibuprofen, really good managing side effects.

It stands reason tiny number people get tough vaccine side effects would likely fared much worse actual virus.

On one hand bit protein starts degrading rapidly -40 degrees, can't replicate, cleared body couple days.

On self replicating, mutating monster natural selection that's discovered replicating penis, heart, lung tissue name few, year people.

This say ""natural immune response require vaccine,"" spreading harmful half-truth. same. vaccine far better safer, fellow humans.

You people would rather risk something turning body trillions imperfect, mutating copies rather body make defense see it.

The eligible unvaccinated absolutely villains. low level executive major retail corporation. dim-wittedness likely selective. Good luck that. Enjoy GDP plummeting isolate unvaccinated population rest world. No, it‚Äôs case common sense. excess deaths happening lockdowns. Go look data march 2020 also April 2020 lockdowns began. lockdowns caused excess deaths haven‚Äôt seen death numbers New Zealand Australia strict lockdowns yet kept virus control?

You don‚Äôt need say anything else‚Ä¶ Delta variant really loss smell/taste symptom all? Pretty much none were, statistically, one jab week before, judging vaccine schedule here. someone tell 3rd wave was? Looking case trends sure looks like 2 waves current cases numbers low, would dictate official 4th wave? Lol. Got em article Netherlands...  Covid give flying fuck feelings.

Perhaps Senator Hawley could help situation? Perhaps? Maybe?  seeing sub 1K weeks, California reported 5730 cases today. sure going one off. Even Santa Clara phenomenal rates vaccination(82% 1 dose 75.3% completed), case number seem go up. hope dont see Delta ++ suddenly making vaccination lot less potent.

The grammar make sense. trying say important parameter predicts risk, part globe, local vaccination rate? Cuz that's complete bullshit: high isolated community (e.g., New Zealand) less risk place ~20% vaccination rate, simply isolation provides much better protection (still low) 20% population vaccinated. Purge : Contagion Edition Well, nobody‚Äôs going stop undergoing measures. Covid going away *ever* that‚Äôs objective fact point, guess best bet lockdown deem safe enough standards.  potential partner declined political reasons medical scientific reasons.  clubs Brussels ask vaccine card door? turn away underagers, antivaxxers? free, easily accessible way prevent happening damn shame basically option resigned to. Everyone walk local walgreens get covid shot free yet there's tens millions country determined never take it. stuck path start. kept stretching definition ""herd immunity"" breaking point unavoidable, half country gotten shot get immunity old fashioned way. US developed vacinnes saving millions lives. Really couldn‚Äôt done more.what New Zealand Australia done? Sealed borders acted smug. Oof yeah that‚Äôs interesting read. Definitely good way put it: arms race. Issue is, whether it‚Äôs early things open (mainly I‚Äôm talking school). Last year HS, kids got covid, I‚Äôm sure way that. Wonder whether colleges reconsider exactly intentions fall, give students ability choose best terms going campus online  Except true!

I hate misinformation UK. starts vaccines amazing post supposed intended fear mongering people suck numbers.

I claiming are, example wise last time similar place (case numbers trajectory) mid December admitting people hospital day.

That true. real data would lull move back effectively zero spread months, new wave begins.

That December, Early September Late October.

There small reduction, wave got worse December. Moreover cases higher positivity, cases missed.

Anyway October - end October deaths spiked. Nearly 2 months beginning surge. 20-50 people daily, around October 20th jumped 70, following week hundreds.

Will happen wave UK? Well no, like said meant fear mongering. keep seeing ""30k cases 9 deaths, back December 1700 deaths"" look actual data, compare last wave actually started... (End august/beginning September) lag roughly 1- 1.5 months deaths started skyrocket.

Deaths also increase hospitalization, hospitalized overburdened. People would otherwise live, die crowded hospital. 

The wave UK started End May/Beginning June.

Like said meant fear mongering, starting see uptick deaths. vulnerable safer due vaccines, see waves 2k dead daily, mean upcoming wave going tiny. even seen deaths yet.

I hope wrong, people pointing UK right really wait least July August half way through. would love wrong, like said bad previously people forget cases missed cases(if get 10k positives, likely 12-15k actually infected, UK getting 70k cases, likely 300k actually infected, COVID death rate 0.6%... Well 1700 deaths * 166 = 282,000 cases).

Also October 2020 admitting 300-600 people hospital daily. 

Kinda like 3-4 hundred now! previous waves, cool UK numbers like 2 months using example proven yet? point legitimate cause think Moderna effective delta variant Pfizer? real information efficacy Moderna delta?

It doesn‚Äôt seem like information available conclusive. Dismantle anything Obama's name it, politicize pandemic, secretly get vaccinated, even getting bad case Covid.

1) supplies issue, but

2) govt sort dropped ball, made promises etc looked bit useless

3) ""targets"" met set local health authorities, set ridiculously low order achieve - vaccinated bugger people.

My dad's 68 cancer, given jab yet - they've vaccinated cancer patient bus driver (social carers)?

Basically much devolvement local authorities, run Pam Whakatane care wards almost full, health authorities said, adding situation catastrophic. one posted link study everyone's reporting want do? Made Va Gina   July 2020, 3 months pandemic hit North America‚Äîover year ago.

Covid everyone understood this. holy shit comment fucking perfect You‚Äôre capable still technically get Covid still, it‚Äôs disinformation suggest getting vaccinated doesn‚Äôt greatly reduce chance spreading virus. Research shows water wet *checks post history*

I think OP fails grasp lot poorer countries much choice, Western vaccines readily available them. ME/CFS. MS stands multiple sclerosis usually. 

Normalizing 3-4 day work week would make things accessible. However, 25% dxed me/cfs either bedbound homebound, 13.5% able work part time full time. majority people me/cfs, would able work 3 day workweek.  Yay! Finally something could actually good news. Aye. Woops, forgot *before* there. still tens millions get infected. Exponential growth starts slow increases quickly. UK 3k cases day little back 27k Boris Johnson said July 19th could 50k cases day. excellent delta single dose.

**Single dose protection symptomatic disease (delta strain)**: 
Pfizer; 56% 
Moderna; 72%

**Single dose protection hospitalisation death (delta strain):** 
Pfizer; 76% 
Moderna; 96%

Sure, younger healthy people safe group get virus, it‚Äôs pretty clear even far less safe get vaccine. square surfaces concern? 

It doesn't. HK, suspected cases delta variant transmission via formite. cases, detected transmission chains mass testing contaminated surfaces objects found  Nope late  mask avoid crowds. problem everyone wants rush opening up. Also corruption comes play developing countries comes vaccine procurement. Chinese companies likely offer kickbacks procure vaccines western companies. indirect effects Covid health services last generation. Yesterday query hospital appointment Liverpool‚Äôs main teaching hospital. appointments clerk said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll give direct number department I‚Äôm working home‚Äù vast majority people get Covid end disabled either. .8% recent covid deaths vaccinated people, 99.2% deaths unvaccinated people. dont think 0% anywhere vaccinated ppl We‚Äôve also using nursing students who‚Äôve likely never administered shot life giving Covid injections. dunno everyone acts like it‚Äôs hard give injection Ww22wwq worth noting Israel results somewhat anomalous though. results coming England, Scotland, Canada show much higher efficacy Israel.

That might countries use longer spacing however, overall results still good Try talking ¬£37,000,000,000 wasted Dido fucking Harding !! Lord really suck saying youre also wrong. Long covid diagnoses like POTS affect young people often statistically hey let's Olympics 10% population vaccinated. Right? system fine, people door nightclubs failed here.

When scan QR code, shows initials birthdate (w/o year) person QR code belongs to. check normal ID shown person.

These nightclubs looked green checkmark app completely ignored ID check. that's people able get copied codes.   Except you‚Äôre making things up. We‚Äôve eliminated small pox polio mandatory vaccinations. *BIG DOG* here!! friend mine got Pfizer months ago tested positive Covid.

Scared immune compromised ass straight. I‚Äôm vaccinated reassured careful family still need be. 

It‚Äôs crazy fast masks flew peoples faces soon could, even people higher risk category. people (well, us) fighting protect seem happiest ones toss masks.    There‚Äôs reason health officials saying vaccinated people still masking well. friend mine got Pfizer months ago tested positive Covid. Many J&amp;J, stupid reason, government issued fully vaccinated QR codes minute receiving shots.

Due great sequencing programme likely detect new variants first Europe. weird part really take many sequencing tests order statistically determine variants dominant given country, still shows new variants originate UK rest Europe Taxes income taxes. parties taxed least every single transaction ever. Everytime goods services exchange gov takes cut.

I can't think single thing I'm taxed somewhere Pfizer Moderna vaccines widely used Singapore.

Sinovac offered fee selected private clinics only.   Simple answer Canada‚Äôs data really incomplete, especially Delta. It‚Äôs admitted authors article. Also studied May Delta became dominant country. seems important.

What you‚Äôre seeing issue measuring small numbers. It‚Äôs Europe   realize probably clarify exactly meant there. ""a lot cases"", meant immunocompromised people. Which, condition taking medications weaken immune system, may fully protected even fully vaccinated. Yeah close friend family gave shit getting vaccine back March. talked shit covid flu bug, impacts elderly, 99.9% people get it, etc. well 3 weeks ago friend family went vacation Mexico, brought back covid. 5 9 family members currently hospital, ages 21-55. truly hope pull through.   Widespread discrimination unvaccinated worked pretty terrible historically.

I say things Darwinism going across several states.  nice Taro Kono said already knew Golden Week (in April). didn‚Äôt tell us?

Oh god already imagine pseudo-science idiots poo swap parties thinking that's works Haha even expressed single opinion topic. zero knowledge claims made me. Oh yeah I‚Äôm looking forward winter. course vaccines great, also need recognize seasonal nature COVID padding summer success numbers extent. 
I guess flu season worse people gathering (and unmasked). report combo COVID/flu shot seemed promising, that‚Äôs something future. 

A COVID/flu combo infection sound terrifying. 

Hey molecule username?  anyone know vaccine vaccines involved study? common use Singapore? Yes, people couldn‚Äôt safely vaccinate deserve die.

Are aware sociopathic sound right now? That‚Äôs one way look it, I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll end going direction people tried restrictions better understanding respiratory illnesses spread kill.

But end don‚Äôt see e.g spectator caps events even worst flu seasons. isn‚Äôt support (I‚Äôm guessing) inconvenience everyone even little bit it. People dying isn‚Äôt preventable, it‚Äôs possible shift flu deaths it‚Äôs typically shifted lot. Absolute death numbers perhaps discussed terms years lost.

Get injected vaccine, inject economy tourism money. Win win know Moderna uses higher concentration mRNA shots. saying though reason.  Yeah..BUT avoided side effects. Technically things true time. could arisen bats, scientists decided study it, accidentally leaked it.

But really understand matters either way. Either way here, either way, despite months warning, almost country anything stop it. 

Let's focus vaccinating every country move on. Kids always listen grown-ups giving advice things bothersome pay future. 302,916 today yesterday? slap face people want vaccines can‚Äôt get.

There's reason science dismisses anecdotal evidence uses objective evidence. Tbh saying make much sense me.

The number ""absolutely solid scientific facts"" like ""not airborne"" hold truly stunning. people push disproven knowledge long everyone knows always false, obscure reasons. go vendetta everyone points like bully truth remember defenders True Faith again.

Moderating mess must absolute hoot. 

We'll muddle somehow. bruh comprehend? Apparently opening borders vaccination programme ""forever"". Good work. Seems like it‚Äôs already control Actually COPPA still there, law sites obey. Sites targeting kids collect private information needs COPPA disclaimer (that supposed approved parent) might chose collect information.  always market high quality organic natural food, may well good NZ. say need plan. Refusing change wanting live 1960's plan. Yeah course! cautious mask least 2 weeks second dose.

Congratulations getting vaccinated!  percent healthy Individuals 50 suffer adverse long lasting effects Covid ?

Novel concept you. getting vaccinated stopping body participating walking petri dish grow another strain COVID - even mild case. one could defeat current vaccine, contagious deadly, making us start again. Every unvaccinated person gets rolls dice happen - regardless age health.  try go two weeks let vaccine take effect it‚Äôs ur second dose  really think magical way preventing variant created inside one america's immunocompromised? dice roll. One thing know america funny thing want vax high chance really unhealthy. developed enough compromised immune systems actually live longer countries, lot incubators.

 knows where, rule us weird.    Also, UK far Covid-19 genome sequencing country - something like 50% sequencing world done UK. international transport hub say, also likely become aware variant's presence faster countries.

[How U.K. Became World Leader Sequencing Coronavirus  echo chamber ridiculous. mean cheering *dead unvaccinated folks*. fuck right off.   Looking Data point 2:

Got poked J&amp;J 2:45pm today. 11pm holy mother God back hurting. opened blinds vaccine-arm whole back seized. vaccine side effect? far fever, headache, illness kind back legs brutal. 24M matters.  Nothing. one reason sensible kiwi happy wait. Interestingly pharmaceutical company Glaxo started NZ, left fit pique fallout government. Medical experts already talking potentially bad flu season year. Add Delta Plus, Lambda, ‚Äúwinter contingency plans‚Äùso winter lockdowns look happening. 

Get mini relaxing rules kick start economy summer months, close winter. mandatory? point? delta variant reinfect people already original strain even infect vaccinated. vaccinated though still unlikely need hospitalization.

No herd immunity right now.. also make non-liquids wet. forget erectile dysfunction. similar note like running theory vaccine form germ killer instead point direction favoring weaker strength instead killing strains may pop weaker instead killing weakest strains allow stronger flourish. think we‚Äôre feeling pretty good right deaths, hospitals places US still don‚Äôt enough ventilators staff people needlessly dying. I‚Äôm certainly going back states get things control. Oh well... First all, flu coronavirus don‚Äôt mutate change way. Flu changes much rapidly drastically. proof pudding. Look UK Israel right you‚Äôll know everything need know future living Covid global community Think missing week work sick take care family (most likely unpaid working kind job). Trusting luck good plan matter circumstances are. People cover other. Neighbors friends help kids. people juggling multiple jobs kids without sort support structure whatsoever, certainly nowhere near ~30% adults US still vaccinated. person already prescribed medication likely get vaccination go pick next refill. understand want slow evolution virus' ability evade vaccines, cause hospitalizations, become transmissible, matter inevitability becoming endemic, right? want worse worse variants become predominant endemic. coworker mine early 2020 sense taste *still* isnt back normal much tastes changed well watching much, need zone back sometimes. Yes can. happens flu. lucky deadly flu: thus luck. flu vax decent job predicting variants worst, flu us, prob long long time. 

We chance end covid, would taken everyone getting vaxed really isolating least month: everyone. planet planes.

So, unless know something Covid variants others don't... battling virus variants long time: Unless get, like said, Bizarrely lucky. Lotto, lucky. ya say Brazil threatened legal actions, backtracked claims. back mask Another wave September schools reopen seem unlikely, question level spread acceptable order return normal life.

By everybody 30-40+ wants (~90%) fully vaccinated everybody 18+ wants received least one dose. Even cases rise, highly doubt see even remotely near effect hospitalizations deaths previous waves. 24 them? Please elucidate conflicts interest. Thanks. Fever body‚Äôs reaction foreign invader. body increases temperature certain aspects immune system work better, well attempting subdue invader ridiculous, best option short term, hardly anybody vaccinated.

Around 60% luck  Folks heads sand think affected late. live Kansas City, although vaccination rates much higher rural Missouri, still many people around refused vaccine. work office urban core hosted two on-site vaccination events, yet I'm confident 70%-80% 500+ employee workforce still unvaccinated. here, wish still place. hope return winter trying get across living covid idea simply possible without mass death. far infectious deadly, evolutionary pressure become less harmful due long incubation period. left uncontrolled continue mutate away vaccine/natural immunity we'll periodic spikes mass death again.

Eradication, hard would take significant organized worldwide effort, real long term option.  wow report defenitely means something! We're several several months behind ""trying eradicate virus"". stay human population that's fact. hope there's easily transmissible lethal form becomes majority, fades background normal respiratory infections much people like think Vaccines 100% safe that‚Äôs simply case. lot people still skeptical vaccine variants may need modify keep them.

The problem lot people sub traumatized covid take ‚Äòcur√© that‚Äôs given scientifically much complicated that. People need see is, take much longer
to get past this. 2 doses pfizer vaxxed doesn‚Äôt mean safe this. Think Smart, many misleading headlines telling vaccines still preventing delta some
aren‚Äôt. 

Eventually need get third dose, that‚Äôs okay. get many vaccines need feel safe. may side effects that‚Äôs okay safe now! guess side effects we're temporarily? 

I've read around many sources say benefits vaccine outweighs risk.

I've asked doctor says get vaccine, I'm worried maybe it'll turn bad yes Iceland pretty well: 14 doughnut days last 3 weeks  Ohhhh noooo.

Anyways. How's life, guys? thing could said overweight preexisting conditions. Seems like bumpkins don‚Äôt want get vaccinated pretty vocal it. Even ones end getting vaccinated due work requirements gladly tell didn‚Äôt want to. NSW stuffed, states back normal running business selling health insurance companies would definitely increase overall premiums give discounts companies workers get vaccinated. 55% adults currently least one shot, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre getting 60% from. Considering third us working multiple gigs get by, I‚Äôm sure scheduling difficulty hard believe. know fact vaccinated and/or eouldn't opposed be?

It's less bad ever been. could still get worse though, likely (although levels seen 2020, hope). Excellent news, positivity rate creeping back (damn Delta variant). Hopefully start shooting again. Illinois' phase restrictions mostly tied positivity rate, it'd suck decided go back phase (also might feel need reduce often long go inside places gets high). hope mate. I‚Äôm struggling. That's true knew coming (I live Florida area anti- mask vaccine). mom works healthcare still require masks patients. masks thrown daily screamed anti- vaccine rhetoric. sad honestly. 
I worried 18 month old (born right pandemic premie...so one even met held outside family) going daycare go back work person campus. university going enforcing vaccines masks. know kids less likely die, worried non less long term effects. Sadly lot friends vacvinated healthcare field, teaching, ect. 2 months counting hope passes quickly  summer 2020 cases practically deaths ICU admissions Sweden. first wave died hard.

The reason may appear like looking cases, testing limited Sweden July so, much longer countries. Basically admitted hospitals tested first wave. Pfizer, jabs April, tested covid positive last week misleading report favor getting vaccine? that's unthinkable Quick question labs able detect Delta using existing testing available today? home tests? show librul......eeeek... previous job, guys US branch talking pandemic things going back normal. sure represent total population numbers much higher 30% news organizations need focus types stories.

Seeing real people affected effective CDC scientists currently unvaccinated.

Unfortunately, willingly ignorant find own... won‚Äôt people vaccinated Looking political affiliation breakdown poll, probably right. mind.my asking Lupus? Narrator: wasn't.  Fox News viewers: Government going door-to-door provide vaccine Govt Telling Do.

No wonder vaccines rollout lagging 48% fully vaccinated. Fox News pitching new door-to-door vaccine initiative intrusion peoples lives. Fox News would apparently rather let viewers get sick let vaccine rollout succeed. think situation UK enough US refer to. speed vaccines UK never slowed significantly, Americans speed up. structure problem though, doctors centers vaccinating had. think big issue media isn‚Äôt talking enough, weird sounds.

Fair enough, guess I'm following correctly. need drink coffee. Well 2nd jab next week given 2-3 weeks afterward effectiveness, I'm least going double masks 1 paper mask. I'm Scotland right now, they'll never let us masking. way could stopped somehow. Like kind medicine something. Oh ok thought defending country lol. like yeah numbers rough. Hang on... thought another study found single dose protection symptomatic disease like 30% Pfizer AZ?

If vaccines effective delta variant single doses, UK government would made serious push single-jab everyone. means 31% vaccinated pool back 'variant factory' business? potentially discouraging. One main point swift vaccination push head mutants, 100's millions carry delta despite 'immune' early strains. mean supposed do? don‚Äôt want get vaccinated, cannot force them. incentives, getting employed, losing family member isn‚Äôt enough get people vaccinated, done? Sometimes experience see dangerous is. Even then, doesn‚Äôt always work (ie Trump). know virus still around, I‚Äôm vaccinated fear dropped tremendously since then. feel confortable going public.  fucking shame restrictions placed whole society one segment people want behave like absolute bellends.

Never would before.   gathered outdoors True, couple points address. That's literally long covid is

I think we've established clearly asymptomatic cases Covid-19 lead Long Covid symptoms. Clearly, *is* long covid is. 

That established, know risk yet long covid breakthrough cases. people vaccinated long breakthrough cases pretty rare, considering take months Long Covid symptoms even surface, simply time analyze risk levels yet. can't dismiss assume there's risk yet.

You've making statements claim lack risk things simply not, know about. 

Given everything that's happened last year half, throw caution wind now. never worked well virus. True, good news n95s back readily available, $2/ea. wasn‚Äôt fully vaccinated, I‚Äôd wearing one everywhere went public, otherwise behaving like middle pandemic. Doesn‚Äôt Trump promote vaccine best thing ever? statement self refutes time Delta 50% Covid cases, it‚Äôs overall case rate went like 2K per day pre delta 10k per day.

I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true. Based GISAID data UK, Delta variant made 34% cases 3rd May‚Äî17th May, 73% cases 17th May‚Äî31st May estimate around mid-May became cases.

Daily cases (7-day average) lowest point 2021 2nd May, 2,020 ([data government May 17th (approximately Delta became dominant), 7-day average 2,301 (up 13.9% lowest point). May 31st, 3,853 (up 90.7%).

The first time 7-day average hit 10k+ June 19th (by point Delta made 90%+, likely 95%+ cases). Vaccines far effective masks. Unfortunately group doesn‚Äôt want vaccine group never wore mask. efficacy rate reflect? I‚Äôm claiming breakthrough doesn‚Äôt/won‚Äôt happen. I‚Äôm claiming variants escape antibodies likely lead mild cases t-cells continue recognize variants thus far continue so. state 150+ hospital workers quit fired mandatory vaccine policy employer. fucking hate living state sometimes. wish shared optimism. vaccine available 12 older couple months vaccination rate 18 less 10%. children vaccinated. don‚Äôt see school districts requiring vaccine. spike underwhelming approve vaccine 12.  get people difficult situations, believe many people manage make happen point last months sufficiently motivated. 

If one REALLY wants something, one usually find way, even significant odds. mean would easy, possible. would need miss three days' pay? Go work shifts, likely fine first dose one day second. one worst reactions second vaccine I've heard about, able take second day problem, to, could worked second day. think reasonable balance arguments. 

For you, people keep seeing ""world ending"" type headlines articles eventually become immune them. keep seeing news different variants new breakthrough cases. I've seen, cases resulting death hospitalizations. 

To person replying to, still follow science variant crops up, discover vaccines last certain amount time, need ready adjust behavior.

I tend lean towards person replying too. daughter niece nephew can't get vaccine yet. can, I'll likely cautious.

Anecdotally, know lot parents got vaccinated soon could, vaccinating kids. trust new, they've told government etc make kids sick. push reopen schools required lie risks children needed precautions safe school almost school actually do. government downplayed it, ""Can't 6 feet social distancing? Well three!"" they're surprised parents take children getting covid seriously, many younger adults taking seriously. Twitter Dr Feigl Dings feed Read comments post want immediate lasting depression. Article read yesterday said 2 shot vaccines 64% effective Delta. Apparently J&amp;J better one. 2 shot, what? 64% doesn‚Äôt make feel confident. ‚ÄúMOH's director medical services Kenneth Mak said experience infections, particularly Delta variant, vaccinated either mildly symptomatic asymptomatic.‚Äù

‚ÄúTherefore reasonable expect within vaccinated group, chances excellent outcome high,"" said. 

Again again, bottom line, need vaccinate globe. Countries excess vaccine (cough cough US) need helping countries don‚Äôt resources. Overall, don‚Äôt let article scare you. GOOD NEWS. one wants covid, asymptotic case mild excellent. Hang peeps. foretold. swear people don‚Äôt listen British &amp; Irish Lions tour South Africa placed threat one touring group's members tested positive coronavirus Lions already one tour match postponed, Bulls Saturday, Gauteng side recorded five positive cases. game could moved Cape Town later Africa's squad, meanwhile, hard hit virus, second Test Georgia Friday called Wednesday, 12 cases camp four Georgia's.

It‚Äôs rugby union seems like every team infected. idea decided go ahead games South Africa.   multiple family members even acknowledge pandemic. How? He's admitting incorrect position important topic, accepting wrong.

Are anti masker? 100% sure long term effects children getting covid. Brazil, Peru, places Latin America haven‚Äôt able fully capture virus statistics (like Mexico), parts Eastern Europe, Italy, UK, countries hit hard first wave.... Yeah people dumb guess covid going cull channel viewers next couple months... lot republicans gotten vaccinated liberal locations yeah won't. I'm annoyed pro-lockdown people much anyone brain, let's go crazy here. Antivaxxers league own, let hook. Yeah, that‚Äôs vaccine widely available. don‚Äôt think anyone put life hold give idiots time educate clearly interest. Even time still surprising much variation region region. least 95% people grocery stores still wearing masks, even though 80% 12 vaccinated. data coming Russia. San-Marino vaccinated Sputnik one covid case entire June. Mexico used several different vaccines, including Pfizer AZ, Sputnik [didn't others (or maybe even fewer, 8 serious cases side-effects 800K administered Sputnik doses, 108 serious cases 7.8M Pfizer doses). Sputnik widely used Argentina found safe. ongoing independent trials [in UAE trust Nature's article, Since then, as-yet unpublished study **from Buenos Aires health ministry Argentina**, involving 40,387 vaccinated 146,194 unvaccinated people aged 60‚Äì79, found single dose Sputnik Light reduced symptomatic infections 78.6%, hospitalizations 87.6% deaths 84.7%.

Which 79.4% single-dose efficiency claim developers. really, claims ""fake Russian data"" getting old. results Russian study different independent results.

Sputnik safe effective, Anti-Sputnik narrative nothing, FUD based Russophobia competing interests. blame gov lot things, case smearing perfectly fine vaccine global pandemics political reasons them. (Russian gov smeared perfectly fine Pfizer AZ vaccines Russian media instead, lol) No. Highly vaccinated states problem. Lowly vaccinated states large problems anything, always. Get shots stop worrying. Yeah that's 3/10 seems weird cause areas I'm hoping it'll 7/10 (the vaccinated people). parents fully vaxxed still go places without masks obviously think lots age obviously think over..I've seen people ages wearing masks stores area gym went yesterday saw maybe 1 mask 100 people There's lots photos mask noncompliance crowding coming Bondi, see states.     
The problem leadership promoted anti-lockdown stance strongly even wanted divert course now, they've raised citizens oppose them.  Unfortunately half country listens -- says something half country. General hygiene mask wearing reduced seasonal colds lowest they've decades wiped multiple strains flu almost completely US. think helping keep others getting sick spraying germs people terrible take question empathy humanity. 
 
If cold, even allergies, absolutely wear mask about. dumb even something cry large group Americans. make case mandates stronger need interact - either directly indirectly - people, die. (Groceries, salary, etc.) No. places higher vaccination rates large going avoid massive outbreaks result that, places lower vaccination rates generally state/local governments care first place Fortunately almost shortage vaccine point US. I'm even vaccinating Canadians weekly basis border starting open up. wear mask shot room one pocket case get close customer. wore N-95 entire pandemic (40-70 hours week) took mine weeks mask mandate lifted corporate policy required it. fully vaccinated employees allowed take masks off, did. 


I'm putting mask back I'm forced to, coworkers fell same. original risk hospitalization death original wild type virus? Feels like approaching restrictions get lifted, yet another case pop restart process again. Locking long term solution, thing reliably works vaccinations. eager without excitement personally. worried I'd get sick, did. Still worth 10/10. 80 year old Pneumonia, sepsis, C. difficile, covid. fella lucky made it! am? Yes. 

If live south 15 minutes outside population center? people find quick praying Jesus keep Covid away instead getting vaccinated going shit. go don‚Äôt expect go planned. Nah, we're used humour much days all, I'm sure smart heck! established cases vaccinated people uniformly ""harmless"". There's still lot learn whether asymptomatic cases result long Covid. know people would revel loss sense taste smell, even symptoms stop there. bet church camp curriculum named ‚ÄúUnmasked‚Äù something equally ironic. read day fully vaccinated people UK died delta variant. Darn it! come use line LOL Darwinism work Ok vaccinated people... wait July 26th full efficacy also work tons tourists honors system. Sucks wait long.  Canada &amp; UK published data deemed it‚Äôs effectiveness‚Ä¶ numbers different? time point protection severe disease/hospitalization isn‚Äôt completely addition protection getting form disease people mass downvote you. 

In mind pandemic over. think get COVID there‚Äôs almost chance serious. don‚Äôt even want parse estimation actually contains rosy outlook others. Well reading comments ""downvoted oblivion"" seem air ""I care covid"" insults someone lives miss information.

So point trying make? really going let Olympics go planned? Really? ‚Ä¢ **29%** say pandemic done; **71%** say ‚Ä¢ **62%** say lives ""somewhat"" back normal; ‚Ä¢ **54%** say lives disrupted ‚Ä¢ **40%** expect lives ever normal Although **a record-high 89% Americans say coronavirus situation improving**, yet ready declare pandemic U.S. **More twice many think pandemic yet (71%) think (29%)**. Republicans far likely Democrats say pandemic over, significant differences also exist gender, age region time, diminished majority Americans, 53%, expect level disruption occurring travel, school, work public events U.S. continue end 2021 longer that, marking nine-point drop since mid-March. Fewer, 47%, say expect degree disturbance society last weeks months.

More link.  Meanwhile organizations governments US giving money, food, alcohol, even weed incentivize people get vaccinated.

That's actually one biggest things forgot - Federal govt done absolutely nothing stoke supply, know can't deliver, trying shown up. wanted us blame complacent, rather attention them.

It's also worth mentioning Australia's *good* part response entirely delivered states, basically run country.

The Feds basically one job, screwed up, we're bit bitter it.

I'm really glad US turned around, incredible watch. case? think authorities idiots. 75% people lived self chosen lock year 25% lived like normal. neighbours Finland Norway took one month lockdown could meet elders live much like normal hear Ibiza already moving ban again. terrible take. I'm idiots wiped gene pool, need push vaccinations un-vaxxed take medical resources beds could used save responsible citizens get sick something Covid. 

If wanna go un-vaxxed that's fine, sign agreement forfeit hospital treatment Covid symptoms severe. Fair's fair. Don‚Äôt even need go far ‚Äúso 100% get vaccine full approval?‚Äù won‚Äôt answer that.  Israel vaccinated earlier rest us? maybe vaccine worn little bit more? think comparing original They‚Äôre adults choose get vaccinated that‚Äôs them. worry vaccinated people. thing seatbelts, grown people choose wear deal consequences. Let‚Äôs move on. Every kid 12 isn‚Äôt vaccinated huge population able catch spread unvaccinated adults. Also vaccination rates universal pockets low rates create clusters virus spread. post history person look like bot. Except major exporter it? Got sources that? depends are. Leeds quite badly student areas. neighborhood (not Leeds) people going door door testing. We're going fucked couple weeks idiots celebrate ""freedom day"" stop wearing masks public transport. Well compare numbers Norway Finland similar population densities. guys want recommend people work home mid March last would unfair everyone can't that. stated bird flu much worse Let tell story country called Sweden‚Ä¶ makes sense totally agree. really hard people access primary care. think see extra pressure NHS wave rise unfortunately, due people vaccinated breakthrough cases vulnerable people. coming conclusion might alternative. Hopefully system manage!    still can't figure anyone believes conspiracies also see many countries - let alone - would collectively agree throw countries' economies bus get vaccinations people 'control them' harm way. Like - REALLY!? weird weird thing. Jabs 4 Throwed Rolls Ok. country biggest population antivaxers then? missed them. app could reserve books go pick up, juggling kids literally parking near library, books needed homeschool ended buying ebay.  Cases asymptomatic counted... Even mild cold like symptoms counted talking vaccinated people. Yeah cases go delta cares? stop life covid cold? No... now? spreading matter 100% vaccinated people get sick covid asymptomatic? doesn't. many 10 Americans think never existed? well yeah, pay pensions, social security old people die. kind wonder amount medicare/medicaid paid covid treatment though. Thanks detailed response. knew complicated thought didn‚Äôt know complexity. 

I say always need remember lucky live USA. supply chain wealth allowed us one first line vaccine, even fucked actual containment disease. course country want vaccinate citizens first sadly came expense countries without access withholding.

My family lives Ecuador aunt 50s allowed sign appointments. even it‚Äôs unknown. Meanwhile organizations governments US giving money, food, alcohol, even weed incentivize people get vaccinated. client told wait final chemo treatment immune system can't build immunity virus right now.   gotten AZ western vaccines healthcare workers. decision use sinovac healthcare workers coming back bite ass. point really don‚Äôt care. vaccine widely available don‚Äôt already it‚Äôs don‚Äôt want it. probably supply constraint driven demand, UK vaccine speed halved last months... Yeah still doesn‚Äôt address Bill Gates injected 5G chips vaccines despite smallest microchip large come syringe. vaccines weren‚Äôt given enough time reveal long term side effects. 3/10 Americans fully vaccinated covid over... that. Idk everyone thread thinks Republicans... mostly people fully vaccinated thinking covid over... Cause us. problem still truly locked down. guarantee point NZ would Level 4, true lockdown, retail restaurants including takeaways closed banned drive car except supermarket. banned meet single person outside household bubble. couple weeks numbers would drop off. mean blame them, held mine still anti bodies natural infection. 

But last antibodies test showed lower result happy with. want Pfizer, I'm willing compromise that. real world data testing. Plus everyone know minor side effects got moderna got fully fucked terms side effects. 

I cancel two far day offering moderna. Third time lucky Monday hopefully pfizer. problem they‚Äôre fully vaccinated?   work you? 1 million cases population 10 million?    matter. happens full approval see places mandate it. especially true military federal government. large work forces get ton people vaccinated, federal rules prevent mandate general approval.

People still choice choose avoid working studying places mandates, majority won't. Fair enough. work kids, daily issue me. mask mandates went away recently, I'm fine adults walking around maskless, I'm shocked many parents bringing unvaccinated kids without masks. vaccination incredibly deadly virus.  kind stretch call 55-65% total population fully vaccinated herd immunity. highly vaccinated states around number. Vermont 66% think. way, want correct, need figure 2 weeks ago, takes 2 weeks get full protection.

On top that, variants also plays factor. Whereas Pfizer vaccine (the effective vaccine) showed could prevent 94% infections (asymptomatic + symptomatic) previously according Israeli data. However, delta changed 64%. probably previously enough prevent cases, enough anymore. top that, virus become much contagious variant. new delta variant almost 2 times contagious original variant. original 70% herd immunity threshold even enough anymore. Herd immunity going happen anywhere current vaccination levels, efficacy contagiousness virus.

The thing keep spread lower make sure vulnerable protected. vaccines still work near perfect severe disease, hospitalisation death. goes vaccines like Pfizer AstraZeneca. keep deaths hospitalisations low, need extremely high vaccination levels vulnerable population. Euro countries including UK well better highly vaccinated regions US. look hospitalisations deaths come countries. NL: 1.9 death per day average 109 currently hospitalised population 17.5 million UK: 20 deaths per day average 1,905 currently hospitalised population 69 million. US fares worse overall. looking highly vaccinated states, like Massachusetts, looks similar. around 1.5 deaths per day average 81 currently hospitalised population 7 million. Keep mind UK month ahead terms delta spread. really refusing then, you. extenuating circumstances. I'm talking people refuse vaccine good reason, people countries situation would *anything* get vaccinated.   unexpectedly. dominant UK awhile probably arrived March earliest.  time give lockdowns Jesus christ imagine unfortunate ones got covid std night  That's like 0.01% people  didn‚Äôt fear side effects yeah would take it. kinda question lol  sounds like vaccinated people almost 1/3 chance contracting passing someone else isn‚Äôt vaccinated. Covid continue mutate spreading amongst unvaccinated. New mutations could worse better, could make current vaccine ineffective.

So longer allow vaccine spread, worse situation get. important vaccinate entire planet.  Yeah, right say: heart goes unable get vaccinated whatever reason)

I kids, reason make lifestyle kid friendly. non issue me. 

(To perfectly clear, I'm one people forcing others return normal. thrust upon well. wish children harm. ) born three months premature &amp; reactions, would take refuse take it?

Basically: want take it, can't? Evolutionary biologist here. Evolution goal-driven. Nature ways anything... nature indifferent ""is"". Viruses also goals. ""successful"" proliferate, spread, continue mutate find new hosts.

That said, obviously size human population overconsumption sub-set population (read: developed world) hugely problematic, likely directly contributed severity pandemic (1) Intrusion over-exploitation wild places, (2) Dense concentration people urban areas allowing much greater spread. really good answer here... humans obviously destroying natural systems Earth, anyone half functioning brain see that. natural systems react purposeful malicious way defend themselves... nature, exists, indifferent, evolutionary forces (including evolution viruses fungi) indifferent. anything comes nature impacts humans goal, impact side effect existence. already number vaccine efficacity lambda? completely understand you‚Äôre saying, original comment point saying thinking anything covid somehow wrong. article said, 7 million people need sort healthcare, can‚Äôt continue ignore find even bigger crisis.

The flu comically unstable. Seems like guy farming downvotes also many unvaccinated-by-choice die, endanger cannot vaccinated yet, namely small children.

And them, regardless die not, incubators evolution even variants.

If selfishness stupidity continue much longer start see escape variants endanger even vaccinated. International tourism used bring 16 billion year. used take 10 billion straight back New Zealanders travelling abroad.

Of international tourists, half Australian, travel bubble mostly open.

There's also big expenses involved servicing tourists, instance imports Avgas way down.

I know 'cool' pro-vaccine, important let egos get way science summer. Last year infection rates went way too. There's false sense really over. starts getting colder, social distancing, them, friends, family members, get covid. saying will, stories shared. ""John got covid, John got sick (or died), vaccinated."" story overr over. really get that, well, else know we'll almost certainly safe, they'll deal it. Oh well. hope spread immunocompromised young get vaccinated yet. No, testing contact tracing capabilities good (unlike Australia) hesitation locking temporarily necessary. I'm confident Delta escape community, we'd able get top quickly. Downplayed who? It‚Äôs dominating news coverage know vaccine less effective mRNA vaccines? insanely high effectiveness virus reason mRNA favored. argument people saying ‚Äú God wanted people fly would given us wings.‚Äù think like places (all?).

The reason virus discriminate illegals also spread it. abused course, created vaccine tourism countries. fear could skew estimates, many people got vaccinated, I've told negligible. Hopefully vaccination program takes more, hoping do. Jesus christ thread filled hate outrage.


Can well understand everyone different risk tolerances social needs? 

Not seeing human faces long term negative emotional effects. numerous showing importance subtle facial features.

Vaccines also effective, 100% effective. pretty good.

Masks effective too, whether admit come drawbacks.

Excellent voluntary control group DDS Mod mah freedumbs!  neighbor sounds like could run office win Glad help! Guess get sick die then. would anyone rather get sick poorly known virus potential long term effects rather vaccine that‚Äôs given hundreds millions times? That‚Äôs quite coincidence. studies work say vaccines work delta X% effectiveness?

It seems like difficult thing study since random trials, seems likely vaccinated populations would behaving differently un-vaccinated lot people going die result economic fallout 

Total nonsense, economy running hot RBNZ likely begin raising interest rates Christmas, years ahead schedule. full employment wages rising, business confidence way up.  know numbers seeing looks like barely half country gotten vaccinated less . states approaching high 70% select many around 30% .  


So people statistically likely state 30% vaccination completely relax safety measures because70% populations fears vaccinations refuses get one right . 


and reason idea strain infecitous last one lock going peoples heads 


Think bad covid lockdowns fewer restrictions , fewer safety protocols, summer people roaming visiting new dominant strain spreading like wildfire .  


I wish people would stop making rest us crazy masking generally concerned . I'm bored quarantine mean I'm willing risk life pretend I'm safe form COVID also killing vaccinated still gonna play safe value others lives .

Multiple vaccines available types used half century, even mRNA works decades. vaccines tweaks multiple decades baseline. wearing masks avoid contracting coronavirus disease (COVID-19) walk zebra crossing Seoul, South Korea, July 5, 2021. SEOUL, July 7 (Reuters) - South Korea reported 1,200 new coronavirus cases past 24 hours, highest daily count since late December, Prime Minister Kim Boo-kyum told COVID-19 response meeting Wednesday. Kim said social distancing measures extended next days officials consider whether toughen existing rules country battles fourth wave pandemic, fuelled highly contagious Delta variant. They're saved! üôè Ding ding. There‚Äôs biggest problem pooled payer system. every person pay 100% medical costs OOP, would much different response pandemic. Hunger games. plus side, cases going bit US, isn‚Äôt going nearly fast UK comparing timelines. time Delta 50% Covid cases, it‚Äôs overall case rate went like 2K per day pre delta 10k per day. drink kool-aid immunocompromised. get killed. moment soon. 2.2 million people vaccinated. number people infected. Sure, ever waste time podunk? Lol Lol. say stopped reporting? numbers gave seems consistent article, numbers wrong? deaths low list‚Ä¶ maybe worry concerning numbers? saying. That's partly second dose vaccinations went quickly, despite booking systems far perfect.  Ikr! like last fall targeted white house! CDC really people dont follow guidelines. pay medical bills? Nu people polled Japan wanted cancelled, government steadfastly support. Nothing US far lower kids 12. Overall fatality rates resemble flu. ratio cases hospitalizations/deaths changing lot, really much data really say exactly much change relates vaccine uptake at-risk populations different countries. UK advanced wave high vaccination levels. see UK average daily deaths increased 6 20. previous waves, deaths lagged cases 3 weeks, last 3 weeks, cases increased 3.5x, could expect 70 daily deaths 3 weeks now. Cases still 40% peak January wave, cases go high again, would mean 170 daily deaths. However January peak 1200 daily deaths. ratio cases/deaths might increased 7-fold. would say actually huge improvement thanks vaccines, UK gets 100+ daily deaths, still equivalent bad flu season (and flu put (or used to) lot strain health systems every year). Now, UK, older people got vaccinated. Netherlands vaccine uptake good great, somewhat lower UK. countries current waves like Portugal Spain amazing vaccine uptake (+97% older populations), would expect cases/deaths ratio different them.

I know mean ""waves mentality"". clearly waves before, even characteristics changed. blow cover troll happens type Joe Biden?

edit: interesting... Anybody know amount weeks shots Singapore? Every side effect vaccine also caused COVID, fact COVID likely cause side effects I'll keep reading agree you.  vaccinated? Idk what‚Äôs harmful knowing cases. want know too. need blast every second television? No. able see numbers. Duh. Scary getting downvoted. young daughter? ages vaccinating? Gordon Freeman flesh. rather, covid 19 variant shots vaccinated months ask? know risks getting shot. feel like getting downvotes attention today?  Yep, see missed that! Totally agree everyone needs vaccinated either way.

I think numbers paint much rosier picture reality would hold. Simply there‚Äôs many variables unique region (vaccination %, mask mandate, masking general), livelihood (grocery store worker, office worker complex large building, doctor, farmer), individual risk mitigation (masking, social distancing, often go public), primary means transportation (public, private).

The unvaccinated farmer middle Kansas isn‚Äôt wearing mask going daily life nothing going (can confirm), risk much different vaccinated office worker LA taking park ride large building downtown wearing mask. Population density population exposure also included. It‚Äôs MIGHT possible calculate aggregate risk percent, it‚Äôs massively moving target taking consideration variants, masking, regional vaccinated %, exponentially transmission. Rolling numbers cover almost 4 million square miles reduces meaning.

However know vaccines reduce risk infection 80% (or 64% Israel saying). whatever baseline risk is, there‚Äôs still 20-36% relative risk infection inoculated.

Your numbers essentially say chance getting Covid (long short) aggregate US 14% six months vaccinated. 

[(1-.000103)^1440 exposed 8 groups 50 day]

Keep mind last summer vaccine saw significant decrease cases well. base rate calculation big variable.  American evangelicals peculiar rest us. evangelical Canadian. vast majority congregation vaccinated, views science gift God, etc. try hands dry human skin fingers rounded tips. figured use moisture produce grab (I grab one item produce, I‚Äôm stroking stranger‚Äôs broccoli) open bags, though. kid played neighbor went water park two weekends ago. I'm sick cold(negative test confirmed). That's real outside world interaction we've since March 2020. (Everything else masked, wiped, socially distanced) I‚Äôm heading Tulsa Little Rock weekend, surges (likely Delta) reported. going dad, we‚Äôre fully vaxxed Pfizer. loving recent Israeli data lower Pfizer efficacy rates. worried would be? I‚Äôm Chicago, 3 10 seems like huge underestimate brown shirts coming less I'm at. I'm fully aware still spreading, already caught covid I'm fully vaccinated now, think/hope I'm good.  Let guess, 3 10 voted Trump/GOP Yeah family included. know it‚Äôs false. Zombies would ignore since brains. dumb? article say ""67% American adults least one shot, 58% fully vaccinated, according CDC"" chart shows US 55%? tangent, someone lives mile National Guard base got F-35s couple years ago (about year moved here), *fuck* things. also live mile airport, noise difference F-35 commercial jet huge - even previous F-16s much less disruptive. fly overhead can't hear TV participate Zoom calls minutes time, week fly overhead times day, sometimes even evenings. scare pets, wake babies naps, even make people's houses shake. Let's ignore population density. Also probably  much larger Indian population UK suspect people traveled India UK point. Funny left part out:

Ok, compare peak cases january hospitalizations 2 weeks that, case, hospitalizations around 75% lower January, that's great progress. know reporting single dose effectiveness vaccines require 2 doses effective. I've continually said beginning see true effects COVID friend's co-worker prime example mean ... going hundreds thousands people may unable work cases, people chronic expensive medical conditions, etc. Also, there's still lots businesses fiscal danger well people months behind bill, unable pay rent mortgages, etc final CDC eviction ban expire 3 weeks.

I want point two acquaintances lost mothers South America last month.  2% us population 6.5 million that‚Äôs large number humans harmed. nothing scared. Vaccines work yes, new variants may become less effective. Similar antibiotic resistance. General hospital floors filled well areas hospital trying avoid that. Yes things aren‚Äôt awful now, process future look ahead. see variant potential lead similar situation need curtail it. said impacts care across specialities. Take care respect around you. best thing life educate good resources. Stop listening others parroting information, people well educated telling you‚Äôre wrong, chances wrong. medical community isn‚Äôt harm keep safe keep safe either way. know knows medicine epidemiology best? I‚Äôll give hint, It‚Äôs average joe opinion tv comment find self fulfilling aligns views Internet. great example danger media based algorithms. People wear pants ones without sunburnt legs.  don‚Äôt get based on. mask requirements anywhere month, besides I‚Äôve heard every holiday special event thanksgiving Christmas super bowl Easter etc  Even widely available, rural Midwest county live 36% vaccinated, last heard.

That 70% number keep hearing we‚Äôve achieved nation nowhere seen rural Midwest‚Ä¶ correct, think easier understand use efficacy numbers instead. numbers show vaccines being:

69% effective preventing infection
93% effective preventing hospitalization

Combined, equals 77.5% effectiveness preventing hospitalization among infected people vaccinated compared infected people vaccinated. vaccine shots one? totally reasonable worry! Personally, feeling even got point made sense lockdown it‚Äôs gonna happen. Maybe watching/reading help. Specifically 2 mins daughter talking.  think form thinking it‚Äôs over, whether mean not, wishful thinking. part problem many people vaccinated national level global level means thing going keep mutating. continues increase odds current vaccination efficacy goes down. 

I really hope doesn‚Äôt happen, I‚Äôm yet saying thing over, even me. however enjoying thoroughly level normalcy now. Fox News cancer country. Don‚Äôt forget previous infection. whole house Covid last summer. big deal us. Kids completely asymptomatic. Wife mild colds. 

For us, Covid well rear window. lost hope


The poll doesn‚Äôt actually show all. hope number incorrect

Pushing aggressive vaccination best thing government done. many friends rejected vaccine. Like India.  would surprised, since tourism main industry, bit we'll see. moment allowed in, fight Delta.

Yea, Vermont probably swing that, Southern Missouri Panhandle ripe thing burn like nothing they've ever seen before. last years virus much less transmissible variant, people guards up. Things wide open now, something Seattle NYC really dealt initial introduction virus last spring. We're gonna see something like last fall again, vaccination rates good enough many regions, especially among age cohorts greater risk. 
 
We call people community idiots getting vaccine, vaccinated folks regions going unfairly face consequences neighbors actions. mention long term economic effects prolonging pandemic aggregate individual losses. Vaccines free, accessible demographics months US now, safe, effective. exhausted healthcare worker dealt ICUs capacity idiots bitching wearing masks months‚Ä¶good fucking riddance ridiculous thing say. amount lives saved economic damage avoided immense. means everything pandemic Australia's situation. country fared better other. congrats!! probably helped clean reservoirs finish inflammatory response instead limbo.

Good riddance! article read shed little light aspect conspiracy theory. Apparently CIA agents targeted specific high powered microwave beam, intended steal information electronic devices, instead gives terrible headache. earned nicknamed ""Havana Syndrome.""

These microwaves, course, nothing 5G specifically, certain unnamed people probably briefed incidents wholly misunderstood happening. quite literally definition freedom. ability make choices responsibility consequences.

It sad many people made bad choice, particularly since many based misleading information, good right make choice. Vaccine rollout everyone getting dying unvaccinated. part that?  Red = Dead  patients hospital covid unvaccinated. 100% agree time give full approval mRNA vaccines drive vaccinations people nervous EUA status

Also means workplaces schools mandate vaccination racism  Popcorn time. families? care. young person? vaccinated ? concerned you? must love you. kinda shocks NZ far behind. Northern Ireland close 90% first dose, 65-70% second dose, pushing 18+ get it. anti-vax crowd outliers. gonna lie though, help travel probably get it... Still makes sense, Pfizer main vaccine used Canada, many cases dec may single dose Pfizer 56% protecting symptomatic disease (and much lower astra Zeneca), Canada logically drowning cases right like UK is, instead we‚Äôre heading towards single digit cases per day Scotland released study well recently Pfizer still 88% effective delta- wonder something amiss Israel study? mean..yeah that‚Äôs kinda virus works lol. Weird headline give idea timeline this, May 10 numbers looked great there. May 20 small increase significant waste water detection. June 1 could tell solid problem. month June, Missouri's case counts doubled. July, expected double triple. 

I'd love blame rural Republicans urban areas bad vaccination rates they're sending rural patients hospitals fill. Columbia pushing capacity Springfield overflow Northern MO (Linn, Livingston) counts increasing. local STL hospitals seeing increased patients ECMO outskirts state. We're inevitably going see counts full spread happening next couple weeks. 

I never stopped masking indoors health condition week state's 10% positivity rate (over 30% SW MO) that's threshold doctor gave lock down. can't go indoors more. I'm glad issues least got haircut, eye doctor visit, gallbladder removal post-vaccine. antibody levels nearly halved losing protection right worst timing. Stop science.

If learn science stuff realize potential variants unlikely threat vaccines, would keep watching news?  read comment reference ""oh no"" parody account gold though get vaccinated walking pharmacy anywhere time 7 days week. There's chance people issues finding time. something straight work day off. really fast simple.  vaccine got stored improperly variant detected last August least data vaccine performance variant. Generally speaking, yes. info spondylitis specifically (I recognize peer-reviewed research paper): search random stuff comes may may significant: may wish find information specific autoimmune disease question, though.

There question effective vaccines taking immune-suppressing medications autoimmune diseases. understanding likely somewhat less effective, still decently effective nothing bad immunocompromised people. FWIW go maskless basically dropped precautions, despite immune-suppressing medication. also live SF everyone's vaccinated there's little covid. Every single person huh? quoting person Yeah, people believe literally anything see random know-nothing YouTube don‚Äôt trust actual professionals. makes sense would choose protected virus killed millions little year. Thanks dominus, heartfelt. difficult share, hoped could save one life here, would well worth it.
I'm fully vaccinated relieved. 
You take care thanks again. strangest maybe dumbest profile I‚Äôve seen site time. Seriously click persons username. Loves: promoting game called alien ant world. Hates: masks vaccines. Wait that‚Äôs real name!? get bad states they‚Äôve chosen get vaccine? supposed feel bad people? every step slowed recovery. ..If way prevent getting virus! üßê see, totally makes sense.  know CEO Cox hospital reported last 2 weeks they've multiple children hospitalized. Last week least one child 1 year age. Springfield School District freaked requiring masks school again. ‚Ä¶But people get sick overwhelmingly putting position choice. That‚Äôs Biden‚Äôs fault. point don‚Äôt feel sorry people passed vaccine come - that‚Äôs totally them. yet see medical reason someone cannot get vaccine severe reaction first dose average IQ. Unfortunately, don‚Äôt think second reason counts much. Yes may small number people whose doctors told get like said, still yet see medical reason can‚Äôt get it. may work well certain people like people immunocompromised I‚Äôm pretty sure people still recommended get it. 

I‚Äôm US live walk appointments Pfizer Moderna yea get rest world like that. lucky. Quality control?  failure people leader ever pulled person houses attend rallies

Horse shit. get leader, tell people jump cliff claim fault following commands. That's excuse conman, leader. get pull card admit conman never leader. People put faith leader, especially since claimed looking best interests. literally blaming feel people (in masses) arrogant lacked common sense stay home.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes. job leader nation stop people stupid shit. leader supposed smarter could see bigger picture vision improving lives people. think got elected first place? can't even that, failed job applied got appointed for.

&amp;#x200B;

And another thing: people already able make informed, rational intelligent decisions every time, what's point ""leader""? put everything vote, every time. need appoint leader decide stuff you.  cough three months last year mystery virus. felt gross sickest I‚Äôve looong time. Covid anything like that, hard pass! Yeah did. said ‚Äúone mRNA vaccines‚Äù meant one brands mRNA vaccines. didn‚Äôt want specify brand received. unvaccinated enemy. 

They discriminated might new mutations thanks good chance mutation becomes powerful vaccine start affecting vaccinated people. 

We'll back square one bunch psychopaths decided take vaccine Pandemic. I'm guessing can, especially hospitalized. read 19% long covid patients asymptomatic acute infection. wrong caring people endless opportunities get vaccinated, haven‚Äôt, get sick? Good them.

Meanwhile sitting home progressing towards hypoxia letting window passive vaccination close.  pandemic over. it‚Äôs time Darwin cleanse antivaxers. seem slippery sloping ‚Äî pretty clear, people don‚Äôt get vaccinated coronavirus shouldn‚Äôt treated it. I‚Äôm comfortable stopping there. Someone day asking ""Phizer varient"" ""efficiency"".  Makes skin crawl. you‚Äôre argument goes back ‚ÄúI‚Äôm inconvenienced. mask isn‚Äôt comfortable‚Äù. That‚Äôs valid argument well-meaning scientific question trying downplay variants (especially unvaccinated people)-- remember reading comment made someone said relevant expert virus would likely evolve time become contagious less deadly. rationale made sense me-- virus sort ""unsuccessful"" kills host-- stops spreading rapidly.

Assuming that's true-- evidence evolution taking place now? typically take years kind evolution occur? misunderstanding comment person made entirely? Im glad least 7 10 Americans least paying attention 3  Indeed, problem. certain area ""trying find"" delta instead randomly sequencing dramatically skew results. Rumor military requiring September, may around time.  news, roughly 3 10 Americans brightest bulbs certain point, life needs stop covid. It‚Äôs way past 15 months it‚Äôs become exhausting. logical scientifically sound reason continue. Enforced Protection group statistically risk vaccinated risk

Alright, yeah proves you‚Äôre dramatically overstating much threat virus is. ever watched Fox News? really feel like alternate universe; it‚Äôs strange surreal watch. calculate efficacy number case? I'm skeptical. got source? Yes many employers going need change policies. 

I shitty employer would say things like ""you can't call sick without doctor's note"". Like supposed 1) get doctor's appointment 2) pay $200+ say ""yep got cold!"".

I worry now, want sick day sill use vacation since employer sick pay. calculated risk allow people go clubbing day shot. recently decided turn back decision, right people get qr code day vaccine anymore. infection death rate absolutely roof right? probably left ghost town, right??? Pfizers sore arm (5 days 1st time w/ much pain kept waking every 2 3 hours, 3 days minor soreness 2nd time). sleeping well (Internet usage keeping wee hours) days leading shots slept 11h straight 2nd one. Felt fine directly 2nd shot spent 3h walking around city still masked 29 ¬∫C. would wipe package it‚Äôs proven virus doesn‚Äôt transmit surfaces? It‚Äôs one thing beginning pandemic know it‚Äôs transmitted, safe without acting like hypochondriacs. don‚Äôt think take account significance mental trauma living terror long. end mental hurt people physical. definitely personally.  basis hope would give people? convincingly predict point Corona variants die out, we'll allowed live normally again? ""zero risk"" new normal, virus, including flu, necessitate lockdowns? address specific question ‚Äúwhen lift mask mandate airports/planes‚Äù don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm suggesting it‚Äôs covid 100% eliminated. I‚Äôll defer experts top data make determination. 

But you‚Äôre reasoning flawed. Inconvenience valid reason abandon masks. risk‚Ä¶ well everyone. large portion population believes vaccine experimental, dangerous, listen politicians doctors, etc. obviously increased risk. 

But even vaccinated risk. average effectiveness vaccine 90% little higher. Even vaccinated, don‚Äôt want sit next someone covid. Holy fuck *what*. would fucking furious live Australia. That‚Äôs true guess. People get choose news much now, probably contributes problem. could still found creative clickbait style ways get people hear truth. Like YouTube whatever, titling video, never thought could happen him, one man‚Äôs fight covid aged lungs 50 years. That‚Äôs hard title ignore clicking. didn‚Äôt see enough type stuff. makes angry.  False. Pfizers vaccine shown 93% effective keeping hospital delta variant. 7% zero   Sweden MUCH worse neighbors. can't point ""success"" Sweden without also looking much better Norway, Finland, Denmark done. see that, given similar conditions, Sweden's approach worse approaches. Going club basic social need. basic human need die infect others. 

If think social contact important, great 4/8 people house.   average across vaccine types used? data individual vaccines? also brother COVID denier, idea why. rest family wearing masks, social distancing, vaccinating! I've yet look long covid , know lose smell taste. There's also lung liver damage? What's standard care ? EU still banned? whole three digits huh? much this, except 3 year old 3 month old take little longer me.  right worried. That's one way we're together another reason (besides basic humanity) need work make vaccine available worldwide whoever take it.  That's true, NZ economic growth pandemic third best performing economy world last year. economy depend tourism. Certain parts country whole negligible impact.

Most NZ happy rollout realise we're position make informed decisions things managed way. We're never going able outbid countries people dying economically tanking would immoral us try. Sorry, diet. want Delta Lite. defining ""surge"" positive variance case numbers... sure feels like wrong metric. Case rate per 100k give us better idea things ""surging"".

[I went ahead graphed case rate per vaccination rate state. x-axis case-per 100k. trend looks pretty clear me, states far right (higher case counts) lower vaccination rates. every poorly vaccinated state midst outbreak, none highly vaccinated ones are.

Of course complicated even this. Look state like Colorado fairly high case load right now. Yet dig county county data see case counts Denver area extremely low rather serious outbreak raging western part state. Wanna guess vaccination rates look like respective places? Colorado's overall vaccination rate respectable, remains risk infections distribution vaccination rate even across state.

If question ""do vaccines correlate lower case rates per 100k"" think answer clearly yes. Like mentioned, Pfizer likely going ask EUA September. That‚Äôs 2-11 year age. think 6 months 2 Q4. That‚Äôs latest info read, least. it‚Äôs not. opinion doesn‚Äôt weigh facts. chosen poorly, deal results. sympathy stupid come rain common, young people died serious side effects covid. There's also protecting others. Getting vaccine means less likely catch spread covid, means less likely give someone may healthy are, risk serious illness death. know infection hospitalization odds general population though. 
These reports list rate infection unvaccinated population, well rate hospitalization general population. 

If divide rate hospitalization rate infection, chance hospitalization infected. 

That vaccinated group around 22.5% large unvaccinated group. 

All need calculation is...  
Infection rate unvaccinated 
Hospitalization rate unvaccinated 
Infection rate vaccinated 
Hospitalization rate vaccinated

These reports list those, usually calculation within report well. Pandemic refers global outbreak beyond expected levels infectious disease. Compared 2 years ago 1 year (hopefully), US still experiencing higher expected levels COVID-19 infection. Further, increasing numbers ‚Äúbreakthrough‚Äù infections vaccinated people becoming infected delta variant. way pandemic US. we're waiting full FDA approval. whole bunch parents going jump drops. beautiful statement. thank sharing this. haven‚Äôt worn mask work 2 months, working retail, eating went times etc. vaccine works, works really well. want move bunker that‚Äôs choice.   Im sorry may sound stupid im currently suffering trough second covid infection (as hadnt chance get shots yet)

But shouldnt vaccine technically also protect ""delta variant""?  Unfortunately vaccinated enough.

In UK, higher levels vaccination US still elements lockdown exploding again. Expectation peak higher peak had.

You month behind us seems likely worse (certainly states) here,

Hope I'm wrong. Unfortunately, parents. also live NE. husband vaccianted. considered high risk leave house vaccinated. keep buying concert tickets fall would willing eat restaurant.

However, toddler vaccinated, best case scenerio 8 months. I've started bring places (like grocery store), hours mostly empty, check case counts every single day try figure odds given stranger COVID bring indoors anywhere. going send preschool fall, keep fighing MIL wants sign indoor group activities fall (ie: swimming, gymnastics, ect). Sure, maybe cases dont increase fall, loosen up, can't financially commit things like watch cases climb back fall schools reopen without vaccines precautions. 

It sucks weird limbo. Czech Republic here. numbers increasing too. naisu Cry harder customers saying glad June 2020 Except everyone get vaccine tomorrow want to- lot children can't. delta variant becomes prevalent, increases chances vaccine-resistant strain pop probably fine. people report minor fatigue like (about 2/3rds people). severe reactions like fever vomiting actually relatively rare (~20%). many people report systemic side effects all. know archived link is. x'D went Publix couple days ago sub. Literally employees wearing mask. Exactly. like anti-doping tests, covid tests managed IOC, interest resides providing entertainment making money. absolutely way trust situation...

EDIT: independent tester power enforce restrictions would work. see happening. Awesome, here. moderna, would tell get J&amp;J different type.  Yes, it‚Äôs wrong. part get vaccine. Vaccine fatigue? Jesus, motherfucking babies. get serology test done measure IgG levels. Much quantitative ‚Äúfeeling terrible‚Äù.

Like article says people don‚Äôt get physical response vaccines, doesn‚Äôt mean aren‚Äôt immune. clarify, comparing vaccinated infected vs unvaccinated infected people?

Person A, vaccinated infected, 77 percent lower chance hospitalized vs person B unvaccinated infected.

Is accurate restatement post? could least used first dose use ""better"" vaccine second dose. [Looks like Bill Burr thought 10% looked low. trouble finding good vaccination rates age whole USA. know find state. like, ""Think second. Just, really stop think words let come tumbling mouth seemingly thought all."" Mind = Blown think high level, say public policy. general tolerance regard. Obviously spectrum, personal. example unvaccinated person going business 2019 vaccinated person going business 2019 may view ""over"". tolerate either, tolerate one, yet someone might OK both.  quite literally definition freedom. ability make choices responsibility consequences.

The definition Liberty makes lot sense too. bad people think means whatever consists freedom everything injures one else**; hence exercise natural rights man limits except assure members society enjoyment rights. limits determined law.  Errr.. really get vaccine case.

No masks, previous immunity, large group social contact = good chance get infected suffer. Health insurance companies probably power impact folks most. vaccinated? Rates go roof. Employers would get employees vaccinated face justified cost increased premiums given expected increase cost caring unvaccinated. another. things always mutate till gone. too, im vaccination. 99.2% highly affective. guess ppl assuming im vaccination stating facts published papers. actually believe covid numbers.

Had old friend tell everyone got vaccine going die that's happened ""studies"". 

She also said hospitals fudging covid death numbers get money.

Her husband nurse want vaccine, hopefully he'll fired soon (anyone health care industry fired refusing without medical reason, imo).

She also said covid numbers would drop vaccine. idea Epoch News telling (that's gets info). That‚Äôs north vs south Florida right there. Let‚Äôs split Florida two states. know sounds defeatist, COVID beginning, lived like hermit long time, got vaccine... sort feel like, Delta gets me, gets me. I'm tired I'm done worrying it. Seattleite here. city first hit 70% vaccinated, believe zip code 88%.

I know pandemic over, things open feels.... pretty safe. 

You know, feels good man. much different 99% scientists saying climate change real sure talking about. express opinion whether parents vaccinate children. stated expect school districts do. get vaccine. best effective protection get  We've reached herd stupidity. difference ""an official government proclamation pandemic over"" ""vaccinated people getting back normal lives despite COVID new virus present community stay"".

The former, helpful regulatory official purposes (ie emergency funding timelines, rules travel, etc), actually end pandemic (in practical sense) people outside regulatory/administrative world.

The latter real marker practical end pandemic, although perfect measure. true ""end"" likely different depending one decides measure it.

I think that, things, bit regional cultural nuance play here. Link study? numbers rising poor indicator interested number cases result something severe. think we're happy link cases severe outcomes apparently largely broken, still concerns. cases means going transmit people, especially unvaccinated. also know extent long covid comes breakthrough cases. Well that's sad 3/10 think over.

To fair, [ya might consider reading OP accurate perspective numbers actually represent. found prolonged physiological impact COVID-19 infection, lasting approximately 2 3 months, average, substantial intraindividual variability, may reflect various levels autonomic nervous system dysfunction potentially ongoing inflammation. correct. 10% chance every exposure. 

We can't put number chance/exposure like that, many variables (how long exposur?, close person you? indoors vs. outdoors, etc)

Efficacy relative risk vaccinated person compared unvaccinated person. such, proper way frame is:

If 10 unvaccinated people would infected, instead 1 vaccinated person would be. Make like 4:1 3:1 J&amp;J, perhaps 4:1 Delta mRNA vaccines, that's still unclear. Winter bad right, vaccinated people much safer year last. We'll wait see suppose. Stay safe! Unfortunately think that's tiny minority anti-vaxxers. simply want anything differently all.   feel same. I'm going focus health immediate family myself, beyond long people creating new strains break vaccines, I'll fine. willfully unvaccinated friends family, get get sick I'll feel bad would donate single cent GoFundMe campaign anything like that. people around world would almost anything get vaccinated point, many people privileged access still reject them. work testing on-site, wanted get tested badly enough let walk get test normal shift. 


I'm sure new rules are, required vaccinations everyone stopped surveillance testing. still get test want one, I'm sure keep clock anymore. read around 90% can't remember where. I'll look it. Arkansan, feel obligated apologize People also suffer long-lasting consequences, 15 long covid clinics NHS building [for given pause concern approach tbh. comment got automodded, why?

A huge problem missouri people literally afraid shots. Springfield high 'needle-drug' use area. Meth Heroin use like walking around arizona iced tea, biggie here... except made \*huge\* portion population absolutely terrified needles due PTSD. real thing, excuses simply hide PTSD. Sufferers think they're perceived 'sissy' 'coward' say they're afraid needles, fear debilitating justify crap excuses... took good day lot personal family support, i'm lucky family wanted get shot -- took one us standing fear get us vaccinated. 
 Hey Missouri, Afraid! Believe Fear Based Propaganda! missouri me, go get shot, right now! safe, tested, real, HURT - biggest problem anticipation anxiety!!!! Yes, understand fact symptoms come variety causes. However, oversimplifying things multiple levels.

For starters, insomnia example, can't look difference 2% test control groups declare difference Covid responsible. always natural variations test control groups, ballpark figure, exact one.

Secondly, seem assuming medical professionals involved studies know symptoms come sources. study linked, everyone involved classified long covid sufferer. admit know details, highly doubt designated Long Covid sufferers first step. If, use allergy example, people developed insomnia weeks months covid infection, doctors treating likely instantly assume runny nose result Long Covid. Chances high common causes associated symptoms ruled classified Long Covid.

I agree complete data needed determine actual levels risk Long Covid, there's much still fail understand it, seem taking approach assuming doctors immediately assigning symptoms Long Covid without ruling alternatives. That's safe assumption make either. kid's daycare, time kid class tests positive entire room shuts 2 weeks PCR tests required return. hesitant (I'm not, I'll calling pediatrician second approved kids), I'd vaccinate able avoid arrange last minute childcare miss work accommodate policy. Unfortunately huge vaccine hesitancy Japan that‚Äôll impede numbers rising much further. Frim read, dd control unvaccinated persons instead used data hospitalizations positve tests without accounting vaccination status Thank God websites. FINALLY able convince girlfriend get vaccinated (getting doses without adverse effects helped!) get registered appointment without needing set account something lol. So? Never have. hospitalizations/deaths should‚Äôve counted Thank answers it! Great job everyone. think going exponentially worse considering took like 3-4 months variant vaccines super great pop up. Winter going another bloodbath sadly. 1) Stuff like gets upvoted time....including one. 

2) data date pre-Delta plenty indications vaccines less protective Delta (though much still know). actually concern first second Pfizer shots. twisted way looking forward action couple days shot. got sore arm, little tired occasionally drowsy next couple days. Nothing like getting laid take day work, muscle pain (above beyond normal muscle aches anyway). partner AZ Moderna, knocked feverish them.

How effectively body incorporated vaccine? less worried catching actual COVID come across it? Thankfully low COVID area moment travel would change that.

(Edit: grammar) We're tracking asymptomatic mild breakthrough infections

To clarify, US ***scaled back*** tracking research asymptomatic mild breakthrough cases. [Some 25+ states still report type sore arm got tired early evening doses, that's it; subjectivity symptoms confusing felt like doses I'd get shot every week way easier thought. 

But feel like hard tell people mean ""it's working."" considered over? vaccines widely available they‚Äôre shipping tons abroad. everyone going get vaccinated everyone means be. don‚Äôt see getting dramatically better years come time it‚Äôs really bad anymore. pandemic everyone wants never people don‚Äôt care. Yearly vaccines like flu shot carry on. Yes completely agree. sense peace normalcy. Totally agreed, though many areas reasonably high vax rates, think would even feel comfortable eating inside busy restaurants. Hey guys, need advice. know convince mom get vaccine.

I can't say anti-vax took get shots growing try convince get COVID vaccine (Moderna). going get J&amp;J blood clot issue made news scared it. severe health anxiety.

I want get it, especially places starting open pretend business usual. I've told want get it. No, they're effective ""not hospitalizing"" also gets downplayed. Latest Israel's study yesterday ~60% lower effective. reason many vaccinated infections continued spread. One point contention ""risk assessment personal"". COVID contagious, personal risk depends behavior others. others spreading virus, risk me. stressful part last 15 months. 

I state incredibly effective vaccines personal risk low regardless other's behaviors. let's forget we're part society. wasn‚Äôt fearful started. 3 I‚Äôm vaccinated masking point useless Lol good ole confirmation bias cases great poor indicator. Jan 29th UK 1300 deaths. Today 33. That‚Äôs true, that‚Äôs say may paranoid worry. even still, it‚Äôs portion long haulers recovering, them. would like know much recover. Back baseline? 90% 80%?

I‚Äôve always been, personal safety perspective, concerned long covid prospect dying covid. someone who‚Äôs concerned long covid, would nice answers. Yeah debating myself, bit hesitate since live Midwest nobody wearing anything despite low vaccination levels, it'll definitely cause reaction. Cool cool get ""I Legend"", vaccinated people hiding away trying escape ""zombies"" actually people realized need treatment late... Even you‚Äôre saying true, it‚Äôs extremely rare.  9/10 journalists redditors seem entirely unaware ‚Äòpandemic‚Äô is. Apparently ended within country‚Äôs borders now. Yes, see mistake now. Hospitalisation compared general population, infected population.

But 22.5% still incorrect. need know infection&amp; hospitalisation odds general population calculate chance getting hospitalized you‚Äôre vaccinated infected. Can‚Äôt fix stupid  significantly slam hospitals/cause deaths (as UK) ""waves"" mentality outdated Wait, what?! 

I told pandemic over!  year thing people still thinking fomites. virus airborne guys... shower pool too. never safe Fauci dropping mind blowing FACTS! 

I understand many young people (18-30 years old) refusing get vaccinated. I'm saying age group one seems LOT age group compared others. 

They refuse get shot they're biggest/loudest complainers wishing life would get back normal. THAT'S GET LIFE BACK NORMAL! Lol understand understand. 

Is getting vax scary? Sure! guess what's scary? 
You get *cough* 1 guess *cough*. 

I want understand reasoning really make sense me. think people get vaccinated good enough, they're safe? That's works. Covid killing currently unvaccinated people &amp; amount people we've taken INFURIATING! please stop losing more? lot people Covid already though going go forever.

Time get healthy keep wearing gear susceptible. numbers speak themselves. 102 country handled well, 600,000 country didn‚Äôt. Sorry dude. know actually got approved vaccine? I'm worried fall School starts since kids 12 can't vaccinated yet. School year starts mid August.  know someone got covid. many symptoms disease, afterwards developed tachycardia slightest exertion. walked 20 feet, heart rate jumped 150 bpm. 

Pretty much took guy used active made could barely walk seconds time.  also hope one groups responsible also responsible enough cancel games start likely see spike majority competition completed first (and maybe second) group athletes left Japan. need remember Olympics two week long event. Olympics becomes global superpreader event there's going time event respond.  ill take ""things never truly happened"" 1000.... agree but. Covid polio. 99.7% chance die, people even notice covid. vaccine 95% effective, horrible side effects far. Cost benefit analysis strong suit it? 23/06 UK:

*I bot, action performed automatically.

Antibody levels slightly lower double dose Pfizer/BioNTech, T-cell levels much higher. Yeah honestly understand many young people (18-30 years old) refusing get vaccinated. I'm saying age group one seems LOT age group compared others. 

They refuse get shot they're biggest/loudest complainers wishing life would get back normal. THAT'S GET LIFE BACK NORMAL! Lol understand understand.

Like said, goddamn frustrating!  Portugal currently 4th wave, fueled thing, delta.

Delta really seems somethign different think whoever lives place hit, thought much vaccinated ready world go back normal taking seriously enough.

Everybody better vaccinate, vaccinate fast possible going get delta sooner later. bet money that. US countrywide stats flat. one anecdote one extremely localized data point. Lol one 2 people Facebook page keep saying random shit like that. Apparently vaccine spreads people somehow. Makes sorta mad sad time. won't, least area (midwest USA). havent seen single person besides store employees wearing mask couple months. intents purposes looked like pandemic months. Nobody talks Covid havent precautions taken awhile. Although cases stayed low far that's good.  can't wear mask? simple non-invasive. Telling people stay home stop clinging reactionary positions rather progressive feels incredibly unreasonable me. mask antivax crowd mask help slow spread potentially protect risk people lack legal protections let stay home. 

I high risk people keep saying ""well keep wearing mask stay home"" enough protect me. need collective action amongst people get control situation. also failed offer solution losing income stay home plan getting green card wife without income. feed house lose job isolating mask mandates? Every day accept risks people choose yet get reasonable answer can't keep simple preventative measures. ceiling likely 80% so. arent even close. Yet another paper absolutely zero control group. 

You can't say 32% suffering ""long covid"" without comparison group previously infected. There's little doubt *some* people experiencing something, also know background rate symptoms 0.

For example, paper link finds 30% kids suffering, [a actually compared seropositive kids seronegative kids found *no difference* rates symptoms. you‚Äôre vaccinated don‚Äôt kids, understand largely you. Especially prior normal wasn‚Äôt big going bars whatever. wouldn‚Äôt clamoring crowded bar restaurant able see vaccinated friends family pretty huge. course correct infections young people, higher prevalence society tend move age groups too. argue wave much manageable due widespread immunity, UK shows us also hospitalizations death increase. 

We already see NL hospital admissions ICU occupancy stopped dropping dropping many weeks.  They're summer break now, several provinces kept open nearly entire school year. Ontario shut couple months since overall transmission got control, Quebec schools open pretty much entire year except couple weeks around Christmas break. Cases increasing countries, unless result high hospitalizations/deaths (which increasingly unlikely get vaccinated) doubt see new lockdowns.  Congratulations. Delta! it! TX

32% fully vaxx, 36% one shot. pandemic certainly Taylor County, TX. There's risk involved anything do. risk probably used take Flu season.

Congrats getting WFH. I'm really hope never go back! masks guns divergent way, using logic? numbers take get. Also routine testing. required routine testing done got vaccinated. I‚Äôm required symptoms. long make . . .  push back months 100th scary variant going work.

I hope right. canada's schools still open summer break? Schools U.K. open another weeks summer believed greatly influenced outbreak. based numbers, safe word I'd use. Low risk feel would apt. 

&amp;#x200B;

The fact vaccinated people still contracting Covid, even dying means still risk involved it.

&amp;#x200B;

That's enough say I'm gonna work home.

&amp;#x200B;

We office almost week, asked WFH, week half since then... there's covid scare already, team officially fully WFH foreseeable future tomorrow. UK vaccinations AZ vaccine. ""Driving drunk improves driving. listen MSM. "" 
- conspiracy theorist deep south rural parts country, 30-40% people vaccinated though. also much cheaper vaccines much easier transport. know got downvoted. went DQ get ice cream worker decided wipe hands pants scratch head proceeding touch food. 

That's unsanitary even original commenter saw unsanitary.  listen progressive radio station Sirius. WAY ahead game Covid starting well aware going anywhere.
So ""media"" spot throughout pandemic.
My ""faux"" news family keeps saying ""no one knew coming"".
Yes. did. propaganda machine chose ignore play it.

As market, knows. What?! No! Impossible! /s Foxnews watchers.  probably late anyway. 

Even get vaccination now, still wait 3-4 weeks second shot. reach full immunity couple weeks second shot. someone getting first shot mRNA vaccine reach peak immunity mid August. virus lot damage 6 weeks.  I'm sure dinosaurs thought same. need let asteroids meteorites flow us finally leave. Keeping distance irrelevant indoors. matter far away someone, share air. moment they're talking giving 50's vulnerable people boosters, likely Pfizer Novovax ever gets approved. 

I AZ early 30's that's live someone who's classified vulnerable, expect get another booster.

From understand people double vaccinated either vaccines getting Delta variant large fine. people need go hospital dying, numbers far way lower previous waves. specifically Evangelicals, seems least vaccinated wide margin groups. group less vaccinated would Christian Scientists 100% anti-vax look data children covid it‚Äôs actually really positive Yea, exactly. speed unvaccinated/un-previously-infected people that's helping Delta get around. It'll harder anything else overtake Delta due immunity amongst herd.

(wrote above):
 
Delta plus spread like Delta...it problem. ""Alpha Plus"" - where'd go? Yes, better evading vaccines/immunity, certain mutations evasion, ability transmission slowed. People got infected variants first, developed immunity, limited spread evasive variants.

Beta (S. African) still best lowering neutralization moment. That's stuck 2% overall cases US many months.

The idea we're going constantly seeing worse worse variants fearmongering. limited amount advantageous mutations. Many mutations popping independently different areas. like virus ""learning"" - arise chance. Speed seems biggest danger. Delta super quick spreading.....will another come along that's faster new antivax infections/breakthrough cases add immunity herd? point, no. We're likely close point. Moderna updated booster evasion anyway - fall (mRNA 1273.351) Runny nose isn‚Äôt symptom. people know wear masks vaccinated. crazy thing person take COVID seriously enough get vaccinated, also someone probably wear mask. probably people see wearing masks US days indeed vaccinated, anti-vaxxers refusing masks vaccines. That's feel like mask wearing much now, ones need wear one ones refusing anything help end pandemic.  office 50+ people work USA, even entertain idea requiring masks. I've surrounded maskless morons past year half. got vaccinated soon able to. Wishful thinking. Essentially zero Yet hospital cases remain stable low. Nothing worry about. young folks getting infected probably care it, shouldn't. really amazes me. people climbing get appointments. get shots arms fast enough pressure let months. 

Now we're living place COVID really minor issue, yet people places really struggling hospitalizations death care less getting shot. 

It's amazing zealotry ignorance people. Never miss opportunity 69 nice. UK variant, double transmissible original covid. True. difficult say joke accusation.  feel like people like push fact mind make feel better. think know variant becomes dominant new case counts going hospitalizations deaths stay flat go down. sign we've turned corner vaccinations potentially mutations make Covid less deadly, transmissible. becomes like seasonal flu another bad cold... over. Delta might one. know month two.  think new thing say hospitals intentionally killing patients putting ventilator. that's probably they're Thanks response! Makes sense now. People clearly interested rate deaths vaccinated vs unvaccinated. say deaths amongst unvaccinated one vaccinated really tell much. Yeah, might qualify, mean lasting negative effects. like Memorial Day spike everyone predicting? you‚Äôre talking Australia New Zealand, combination low natural immunity (which great they‚Äôve minimized contagion deaths, really bad getting herd immunity) poor vaccine rollout high vaccine hesitancy puts really tough place actually ending things. 88% near enough amount people vaccinated end month. (since 18s going currently).

And September UK starting 3rd doses.

So reach herd immunity quickly enough. Unless vaccine resistant strain comes. madness see real-world reports like one Brazil top sub.

It‚Äôs effective, available $2/dose, world ‚Äúnah, we‚Äôre OK Covid instead, thanks anyway, maybe try country next door‚Äù. Ever heard story God giving man boats etc save with? That‚Äôs logic you‚Äôre misconstruing. data back up? looking info around recently curve new cases least steep curve winter spike, one vaccinated. think post fully convincingly explains we're seeing there. high infection rate matter? risk ending hospital fully vaccinated young people get hospital. infections lead hospitalizations anymore whole point vaccinations first place Yes, understand long haul issues? Thats is, media wants cling long possible. people scared, people watch. people living lives, watching.

if fully vaccinated, go live life, listen doomsayers. Okay, think masks don‚Äôt work, don‚Äôt think vaccines enough uptake, want then? Perpetual shut downs New York people Missouri get 70% vaccinated rate? Oh no!!! us vaccinated folks do! horror dying! Oh nooooo! one find infection demographics? Yeah, l like ""Are guys sure afford considering abysmal vaccination rates?"" WELP, is. personally, pretty since fully vaccinated. kids, really restrictions occasional mask wearing.

For people vaccinated, definitely even think is. feel bad people kids 12 want vaccinated. 

I feel like longer thing goes on, risk variant kit kids harder. think it‚Äôs pretty clear less hospitalizations per case mass vaccination. 


Yes, that's true. also mean case levels completely irrelevant, tolerate higher amount.

It difficult balance, really think there's much Netherlands. pretty much open everything. 911 expensive.

Wait take one repairs lmao. counting per capita, US population 300 quite large. OP said ""largest population antivaxers.""

40% antivax US 160 m.

The entire population Russia 144m

But yes, lot wealthy countries large antivax populations predating Covid. Japan France two stand ones. think conservative/republicans jamming bars/clubs back 2020?

I'm Texas too, I'd say could probably find people sides acting like COVID. anyone tell current mutations increase ability enter via GRP78 receptor? make difference. News ran stories year comment sections filled ""stop fear mongering"" ""China's paying spread agenda!"" 

They care unless effects personally ""how supposed know bad?"" Right. You‚Äôre protected, protection also helps folks around you. Thank üôè 

At time, point vaccination programs isn‚Äôt protect immune (the vaccinated). They‚Äôre designed strengthen *community* immunity, too. 

You‚Äôre part. 

Fact remains, 40+ million kids 12 completely unvaccinated. They‚Äôre reservoir unmitigated spread, variants concern, escape immunity, unfortunately. unmasked antivaxxers. :(

Additionally, 48% Americans fully vaccinated rn, although we‚Äôre getting closer goals every day. 

But yeah, you‚Äôre still safe vaccine protects you. 

Millions folks jab even risk variants, millions folks 1 2 jabs markedly lower protection breakthrough infections escape immunity.

All things simultaneously true. ;) Thanks link, come handy arguing antivaxxers. I've showing proof mRNA vaccine human use since 2017 CMV vaccine, link helpful show even longer use case! Also less 1% cases. Athletes already entered sports village, way change plan way. would read article, actually seems thought through. follow Singapore's lead stop counting cases. purpose serve point fodder fear mongering got source claim mRNA vaccines? I'm pretty sure millions vaccinated people come contact pathogen they're vaccinated immune system overload kill them. permanent temporary measure. mean signal booster shot? :P Based knowledge average American, pretty sure 50% moronic population believes never started One example disprove claim. Polling vaccination rate state shows disparity political parties. actually study line UK study Israel study. latter two looked symptomatic Covid. Uk said 80-90, Israel one said 60ish. study shows 80-90% symptomatic Covid.

This study far precise also looked asymptomatic Covid, got 69% from. generally accepted vaccines pushed asymptomatic Covid 70ish percent. It‚Äôs hard know much spread comes that. 

This Singapore study pretty small sample size tho. obviously part plan eliminate unvaccinated! 

/s agree. don‚Äôt mean sound cold, point longer sympathize refuse adopt vaccine. tell it‚Äôs Darwinian evolution. won‚Äôt use brains, species move forward without them. vaccination rollout still progress countries. Mod abuse real. Hows pfizer efficacy variant? data available? No, quite opposite, promising trial. went far many GPs set private vaccination centers inviting everyone grandmother get vaccinated collecting lots money per shot government

WHAT? 

This thread interesting, idea vaccination systems different.

I Portugal, got frills system. Vaccination centers, two ways setting appointment (health centre calls people done mostly elderly vulnerable) site opens according age group. 

You pick date centre, send sms hour, get get, picking vaccine get. second date fixed, 4 weeks first dose mrna, 8 weeks AZ. payment ever, nothing. 

After certain time, anybody certain age received first shot show vaccination centre either get shot told close date get it. Next time make counterpoint else admit you‚Äôre wrong :) Run like NBA Disneyworld bubble may contagious, likely lead hospitalizations deaths? UK, infections spiking, deaths budged, looks like good sign. Get everyone infected contagious less deadly strain, it'll give immunity strains. guess is, huh. point God gave us tools save with. Guns masks, thing case. You‚Äôre understanding me, you‚Äôre bashing ‚Äúreligion bad‚Äù. mean expecting doubling every two weeks, feels much faster (but kids summer break little idea day is). argument old Christianity (possibly predates it, ignorant Judaism)

How God's exist time free will? God's plan, punished go hell sins? let us sin? God *let us* go Hell, damn us since born? Total tangent, life hack anyone trying open plastic bag: hold bag thumb index finger rub thumb finger together. Quick, easy, spit required! Well, begin with, mixed number things here.

Your study looking children determining percentages infected noninfected children claim list symptoms. 

The study linked limited children, looked exclusively people suffering Long Covid, checking percentage developed symptoms asymptomatic infection. study linked, entire test group Long Covid sufferers, infact say suffering 'Long Covid.'. 

The two articles saying different things, unless trying deny existence Long Covid I'm little uncertain point aiming here.

Also, concerns article linked: read full text, shaky methodology. Nowhere say symptoms tracking, say whether removed people reported symptoms new cause outside covid.

Allergy sufferers report symptoms shared Covid, example, children parents would reported symptoms, accounted skew results. California, unvaccinated employees still wear them. public places going elevated risk delta hitting children harder previous variants, yet aren‚Äôt vaccinated masked, ubiquitous public settings protocols lifted. I‚Äôd mask around places children right now. Thank goodness, tackling real hard hitting issues.

/s  limited study Pfizer alone, maybe quite proper, mean run know, limited study.

My wife‚Äôs advice, followed since getting vaccinated, wear well fitting surgical masks indoors.

N95 level kids, surgical masks rest us.

She watched time time staff would get sick community, one else clinic wards would get sick even prolonged close contact due 100% mask utilization policy eat outside car.

I haven‚Äôt seen study masks done Delta, maybe enough gets masks launch infection, great stopping whatever variant got clobbered used properly.

I‚Äôd probably minimize time inside, inside I‚Äôd mask keep distant others, definitely eat outdoors only. Nothing top. There's 4 tiers outcomes, asymptomatic, symptomatic, hospitalization death, make sure looking number represents. 

Then there's confidence intervals makes total sense good know. feels like everything happens UK/Europe covid, aren‚Äôt far behind US, it‚Äôs good get foresight, even completely sucks (which doesn‚Äôt really seem to, you‚Äôre unvaxxed vulnerable). No. Vaccines available every corner pharmacy anyone wants one. Plus, many people can‚Äôt stomach walking back restrictions everything opened up. Also, CA‚Äôs governor facing recall putting restrictions back hurt politically.  be, won't. 

Abbott gonna drool something personal responsibility base seal-clap. think people Sweden France can't get vaccine want to? people choosing get Americans. France debating makin law health care workers get vaccine many want Without title 1 money, public schools rural areas would big trouble That‚Äôs terrible basically idiots list waiting get sick think it‚Äôs pretty clear less hospitalizations per case mass vaccination. 

What miss bit government clear goal posts. 

There always people scream zero covid, people wants everything open, matter death toll. It‚Äôs incredibly difficult balance opening society much possible keeping healthcare operating normal level. threshold always herd immunity rates vaccination bar stop pestering people. say ""me wearing mask helps much"" means incredibly different views helping fellow humans. easy, simple solution shown help even huge help need cover bases. 

I would argue even small benefit low effort even question hit tipping points vaccination rates.That minority unvaccinated people still expanded range influence infection vaccinated people still spread refuse wear masks. 

I'm sorry feel called literally skipping helping minor inconvenience. parts even small parts. 

The antivax crowd educated least shrink remaining % herd immunity. 

On topic respiratory diseases lots countries already mask flu/cold season wear masks feeling well. normalized minor inconvenience U.S. see good reason adopt preventative measures moving forward especially seeing masking made flu season nearly non-existent lot U.S. past season.  exist too! lot wear masks want know didn‚Äôt ‚Äúsuccumb‚Äù government ‚Äúploy‚Äù  mean troops ~50% vaccine refusal rates? wait till hear climate change (LMAO, we're doomed)  Eventually probably infected Covid whether vaccinated not. Multiple times.

So continue strive Covid zero figure out? *you're I'm sorry think misunderstood meant Antivaxers. I'm talking people vaccinated yet. I'm talking people REFUSE vaccinated  media idiotic politicians want face criticism care cases sadly.  Good thing banned runner since smoked pot!

/s say ‚Äúless,‚Äù it‚Äôs actually small amount ‚Äúless,‚Äù don‚Äôt tell headline earn click. that‚Äôs predictable. wasn‚Äôt foreseen amount vaccinated refuse wear mask given still spread virus, especially Delta.

Even frustrating increase rate infection amongst young children, yet aren‚Äôt vaccinated wearing masks. 

Meanwhile Pfizer drooling killing they‚Äôre gonna make ‚Äúendemic covid‚Äù  Delaying what? delayed whole year already, cancellation anything. Depends go, Hungary, Denmark Poland fully open believe, imagine neighbouring countries well. Sucks whole continent yourself, still island. [Brazilian city reports 81% drop COVID-19 cases AstraZeneca first dose mass vast majority people. comments really make sense. there's ""gods will"" whatever jargon using mean can't control individual lives lol. Christianity literally states god gave people free comment make sense, ignorant religion making fun of. Quit bashing people religion something productive. Yeah, New England really crazy think pandemic over. Yeah can‚Äôt live something unless there‚Äôs lot immunity.

Australia hasn‚Äôt done vaccine thing well. Tell anti statistics without quoting statistic like corona tore Texas mask mandate lifted? Saw coming, admittedly quicker expected.

Glad I'm vaxxed! Yay science! Singapore, Taiwan, south korea. they're great. cuss anyone breath hear it. There's really ""planned' situation. There's established FDA process demonstrating efficacy safety requires injecting certain number participants either vaccine placebo, waiting certain number study participants test positive ""unblinding"" study see many people tested positive placebo compared actual vaccine. try give best chance getting faster result trying find participants places think see higher infection rates, gets tricky. days, article says ‚Äúmore‚Äù ‚Äúless‚Äù without elaborating *how much* less regards vaccines, it‚Äôs likely clickbait. good. Let spread. about, don‚Äôt know, July 4th?  non digital proof like yellow card.  Yup. specific source handy, I've seen articles, average age fully vaccinated people end breakthrough infection requiring hospitalization mid late 70s. One week later new cases sevenfold. hope new wave hospitals coming, bit early completely demolish /u/Gomorritas comment. Paywalled. would call doctors nurses deployed failing hospital failing hospital fraction civilian market value? population 50% fully vaccinated still hundreds deaths every day there. we‚Äôve living life pretty much normal past two months, massive concerts, masks schools, masks planes. overwhelmed hospitals hundreds thousands deaths unlike lol It‚Äôs gonna suck cuz athletes gonna catch games barred competing. made whole trip, chance life time, sitting room quarantining. also true year ago Here‚Äôs thing, media relies headlines unvaccinated people testing positive ruining things everyone‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm thinking would jump chance well vaccinated  Singapore also tests every contact positive person, expect pick high number asymptomatic infections.

With mind, think 70% number infection surprising, 80-90% symptomatic infection pretty much confirms UK's 88% number. Seems clear Israel's 64% number wrong.  course, yes. year half, would think immunocompromised people world bit handle keep safe. talking them. talking selfish assholes put people risk point I'm making 0-10 days exactly long time period. think conflating analysis 60+ days statistic 0-10.

And yes, allergy sufferer pulled - either seropositive seronegative group. group, first time allergy sufferer (or, know, person experiencing anxiety first time due state world) assumed due long covid. That's problematic, I'm glad agree that.

You drew conclusion paper linked meant significant portion asymptomatic cases result long covid. can't determined basis evidence have, fact best evidence (the one control group) points significant exaggeration. Uh, maybe 58 million kids 12 vaccinated? I'm 40%.

And less ""Oh dont wear mask now"" everything view world whole forever changed. ""exhausting"" wear mask keep polite distance strangers?

Must tough living Uhh overlooking something obvious? I‚Äôm 5 pints deep it‚Äôs entirely possible. though? Numbers time lows. We're even seeing days deaths single digit infections.

I'm anti vaxxer anti masker anything ridiculous like that. Possibly ignorant. Someone please explain considered over? job become mandatorily 100% remote, things going back ""normal"" me, that's necessarily bad thing Back 1980s Scuba Diving Keys, nice area, rest it, nah. fly Jacksonville work one time, head Georgia. frustrating solo parent child 12. still can't go places people pretending wearing masks. fully expect Delta variant rage US fall force mask mandate again. friend mine thinks world never return normal now.

It's upsetting me, that's clearly case Extremely unlikely youre vaccinated. Less simply getting sick pandemic.

Not vaccine drastically reduce chances getting it. massively increases bodies ability fight even notice OP article says 3 125 (2.4%) delta variant. Totally agree. Plenty people selfish, rationalize masquerading ""Libertarians"". Yeah, technology already place huge! worry though, even modify vaccine new spike protein get approved weeks, production rollout still going take time variant rages. anticipate could bit public trust issue, too, people hesitant get first one going hard time going back variant.

Now it‚Äôs presented like booster first shot, might one thing, god help us start calling something new lol. That‚Äôs weird. got without sign pay know things fucked plan along Japan, can't even keep lid it. Well, also immunocompromised people others can't get vaccine. make really unable sympathy 

lol let get idiot refuses wear seat belt, loudly proclaims seat belts cause cancer problems, dies car accident I'm going feel sympathy. death 100% preventable stupidity they'd alive now.  still consider Galveston part greater Houston area, church camp Galveston County, know church's locations Houston, League City, Friendswood. folks lost jobs Methodist, sure specific location at, Methodist Houston area. took covid seriously June year. distanced, barely saw family, go eat, go vacation, pulled kids daycare managed juggle schedule work, got tested times, got vaccine soon age range allowed around April.



Now over. Everyone wants vaccine get one live. Regular life continue. Obviously there's things like long distance traveling border crossing taken cautiously... normal every day life possible without distancing mask wearing. university Mainz tracked 10,000 people course 10 months.

According results 40% people caught Covid idea, asymptomatic therefore never got tested. [This roughly confirms earlier German study, set number 30%.]

Surprisingly, number undetected infections lower young people (35-40%) higher elderly (50-63%). course, among young people asymptomatic cases, likely get tested (maybe work; friend Covid, etc.). 

The elderly less likely get tested; especially already vaccinated get test get ill feel reasonably sure possibly Covid.

Men likely undetected infection women.

.

Other results:

- Women likely report side-effects vaccine men.

- people living cramped conditions (e. g. poverty), 60% likely catch Covid. wouldn‚Äôt entirely fault days vaccine.

You die completely preventable needless death order receive Darwin‚Äôs honor, quite thing natural selection. They'll marked essential workers were/are first line vaccines believe yeah die. like 98% survive tho unfortunately we'll likely share planet them.

&amp;#x200B;

edit: 99% main goal restrictions NL?  here. people know. one sister get vaccinated, tell rest family getting together. Sad, rest us getting life choice. loaded question though. Like perspective, live small town Western got completely overrun outmigration NYC housing market insanely high, town overpopulated traffic higher ive ever seen (25 mins drive half mile town pick kids), restaurants completely overfilled everyone doesnt staff handle surge. guess would say myopic standpoint, don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going return pre-Covid norms. Ôøº  like old joke bible thumper caught flood - praying God help.

Soon man rowboat came fellow shouted man roof, ""Jump in, save you.""

The stranded fellow shouted back, ""No, OK, I'm praying God going save me.""

So rowboat went on.

Then motorboat came by. ""The fellow motorboat shouted, ""Jump in, save you.""

To stranded man said, ""No thanks, I'm praying God going save me. faith.""

So motorboat went on.

Then helicopter came pilot shouted down, ""Grab rope lift safety.""

To stranded man replied, ""No thanks, I'm praying God going save me. faith.""

So helicopter reluctantly flew away.

Soon water rose rooftop man drowned. went Heaven. finally got chance discuss whole situation God, point exclaimed, ""I faith save me, let drown. understand why!""

To God replied, ""I sent rowboat motorboat helicopter, expect?"" Yes, immunity level higher. many studies measured antibody levels. know correlates actual protective sterilizing immunity, also higher. I'm going honest. I'm fully vaccinated, family I'm still pretty vigilant point. state I'm already reached 70% I'm still paranoid I'll catch COVID bring house. time, realize we're still pandemic, much better last year seemingly starting slow down.

I want done it, feel like still look shoulder. wild single parent child &lt;12 even fathom thinking we've gotten CLOSE kids vaccinated yet. Absurd.  Really expect like worse common cold going forward: there'll booster shot every year choose get life largely go Oh yah sure seems like legit site... many teens young adults say vaccine side effects worth mild case covid (if even get first place)

Except wrong, vaccine fewer side effects virus. think framework thinking way complicated needs be, I'm misunderstanding you. 

How studies work single population (Israeli citizens) broken cohorts (vaccinated/not vaccinated) [if good study] controlled demographics (age/employment/health/etc). look many group: 1) tested positive COVID; 2) COVID symptoms; 3) hospitalized COVID (aka severe COVID); 4) died COVID.

So measure efficacy see number like 95% efficacy, means observed 20 times cases (controlled size) unvaccinated group. people understand pretty easily, look severe COVID people get bit mixed up.

If hear vaccine 95% effective preventing hospitalization/death, might think that's **on top** protection symptomatic COVID. not, that's similar comparison many deaths/hospitalizations unvaccinated control compared vaccine cohort. 

So happens get COVID vaccinated vaccine that's rated 95% effective (generally) 95% effective preventing severe COVID? expect symptoms bad likely hospitalize unvaccinated, protection severe COVID would solely coming reduced chance getting form COVID. 58 million kids age 12 US. None vaccinated. pandemic **IS OVER**.  takes ""few"" sequences get relative prevalence within percentage points. US thousands tens thousands sequences week. misleading part using word ""now"". samples weeks ago, infections could nearly month old. US India travel UK too. they're bad is. state NY vaccinations 70% rising ..? Yeah. over.  Amen! Thanks, followed:) south. Unfortunely even initial 2.5% death rate enough natural selection. thing needs 25% death rate people wake fuck up. decent smart people already vaccinated  post sounds strong you? virus could also mutate less transmissible/lethal. virus host live (aka infecting people/causing positive case) virus far weaker opportunity mutate stronger variant mutations occur living host. Vaccination end pandemic completely significantly increases worlds chances defeat (assuming majority worlds population participates vaccine efforts). realize deadly serious many are, know problems getting better time soon. really, americans health insurance happy policy. people uninsured underinsured need help, circle jerk medical issue America guaranteed bankrputcy bullshit people actually know anything. worry happens recall I'm curious France lock back down, follow UK model opening back since people vaccinated.   Interesting perspective! Thanks sharing. pains say yes, does. love make hard sympathetic keep bringing themselves..... over. Lol hotspots. I‚Äôm PA last week lowest recorded week since started. Therefore anything eternal decrease impossible guaranteed take PA green dreaded yellow growing hotspot potential. Fwiw believe increase 6%. could go 500% still even near winter peaks. transmissions? odd mandated masks. Even LA county made recommendation (which even line threat country).

That's norm USA. Sure, whole picture, remember. Population pools host vaccine unchecked develop new strains due viruses virus. means increased rate new threats may get lucky march straight vaccinated population (no guarantee current vaccines much help later strains - mean maybe probably help, nobody knows).

It also discounts ""long covid"" issue - may survivable trigger longer conditions aggravate pre-existing conditions. hospitalisation rises may also mean fewer facilities treat chronic conditions.

Deaths whole story, that's :)  think will. One mother (lives far away her) older health problems. point she'll want see person. mother vaccineted ""it's devil's work"". wish joking. lot institutions like military K-12 school districts currently mandating vaccination emergency status. much potential blow back.

But full FDA approval obtained, expect mandates start pushing numbers again.

And lot rural areas problems currently see need. high percentages at-risk people like stack firewood -- waiting match. virus hits spots, lot opinions might suddenly changed.

Lastly, immunity standpoint, someone recovered Covid nearly category vaccinated. one knows many people is. said 1/3 1/2 population, can't proved without LOT randomized community testing one seems committed that. point vaccination totals may accurately represent immune country really is. Yep, work software there's reason need office. Outside Corona, would good air pollution, traffic congestion, climate change also quality life family relationships much less people commute. really enjoy around 1 year old son every day! sacrifice productivity? Shut get back work, hygiene time! /s 28,334 cases UK yesterday. learned viruses fungi nature's way controlling dominance one species taking ecosystem.

This true. Viruses fungi even 'nature', feelings intent maybe reproduce. may easier viruses spread dense population, intent ""control"" population.

It sounds like ""just world"" fallacy. literally told office I'm comfortable going back. I'm vaccinated wore mask unless desk (I phone support currently). 

&amp;#x200B;

no way hell going anywhere yet. mechanisms immune escape besides changing structure spike protein: could asymptotic carrier. wants participate society like, buying groceries, running general errands, get vaccine prevent spreading others. 

If lives grid cabin plans never rejoin society, sure. Otherwise he‚Äôs spreader. since access vaccine chooses - malicious.

He every right choose get vaccine - so, reveals selfish uncaring nature.

For reference, least one two best friends (both groomsmen wedding) yet get vaccine girlfriend said isn‚Äôt planning it. used refer ‚ÄúUncle‚Äù kids. 

If doesn‚Äôt get vaccinated, he‚Äôs welcome house. Otherwise he‚Äôs good guy. phrase ‚Äúapart danger young children, he‚Äôs good guy‚Äù, makes things immediately clear side road wants on. wonder make people realize can't freeload got vaccinated. even then, immune. still catch it, nearly likely, symptoms mild compared unvaccinated. must local then. US countrywide stats flat. people refusing vaccine. letting rip helps focus health issues pretty disingenuous.

This would make sense year ago. link cases hospitalizations pretty well broken. unlikely hospitals overwhelmed highly vaccinated countries.  get covid vaccinated like booster shot. 

No, no. makes sound like good thing get breakthrough infection. not. Yes, end immune reactions it, still risk serious disease, figured enough Long Covid symptoms know risk. Plenty low symptom asymptomatic cases suffered them, know risk breakthrough infection. tiny percentage may get vaccine becomes mandatory jobs, military, etc. otherwise yes. area similar numbers. Honestly, consider go big family holiday without surge. December sees surge Thanksgiving, over. ""he said data also showed vaccine's protection symptomatic disease ‚Äúbetween 80 90 per cent‚Äù.

‚ÄúEffectiveness vaccination severe COVID-19 disease, requiring oxygen supplementation, ICU (intensive care unit) care death, 93 per cent,‚Äù added.""

So 5 100 unvaccinated ends hospital, 0.35 100 fully vaccinated ends hospital.

Even Delta protection Pfizer pretty good. Imagine one overworked ICU staff trying save patients, knowing 90% could gotten vaccine chose to. look death rate excluding Victorian wave far lower though - got old age homes vaccines really stacked numbers, unfortunately involved.

But see similar concern NSW. really meticulous tracking, yet hospitalisation rate around 10%, figures hospital. 14 55 years old. 8 35. 1 30s ICU.

I high confidence NSW identify vast majority cases, giving reasonable threat assessment delta largely unvaccinated population. I'm pretty sure Pfizer given AZ now. also midwestern progressive it‚Äôs over.  office dropped it‚Äôs mask mandate last Thursday provide proof vaccination final day ‚ÄúCOVID calendar‚Äù. I‚Äôve flown packed Las Vegas, ate inside restaurant, hugged fully vaccinated 85 year old mom. think worried Delta Plus Lambda variant, Idk gave name ""Delta Plus"" cause theres little evidence thats sort jacked version 

I impression plus simply similar delta get letter.

It simply Delta one additional mutation, K417N. ""Officials India say added mutation necessarily make Delta Plus dangerous Delta.""  sure right forum ask, I'll ask anyway I've never gotten answer yet peculiar topic. learned viruses fungi nature's way controlling dominance one species taking ecosystem. said Covid-19 precisely? example, learned Planet series Netflix fungi spores Amazon constantly infect decimate populations insects means prevent proliferation one insect species dominating Amazon. 

Given large human population, pandemic inevitable nature simply taking course control human population? everyone wants protection vaccinated.

Except kids. people bother exclude thinking whether 'It's over'. Covid positive patient get hospital get MRI? US requires Covid test. Breast cancer That's different refusing vaccine.  Watch out.. seasonal flu coming! one fkn cares, seriously 99% chance survival avg Joe. hosts? Many times compare oranges apples. 60% adults fully vaccinated. ~209Mln means ~125,477 Mln. Assuming vaccinated recovered/dead ppl 100% immune get pass disease, means still ~150 Mln people aged 10yo able get pass disease (partial vaccination proved poor performance delta). currently 13k tot infections per day now. know super rough estimates, looking orders magnitude think still room messing again. Well prevalence variant likely higher initial estimates. US sequence COVID19 samples much countries, takes bit longer us realize prevalent variant is. thing happened UK variant. ‚ÄúLive‚Äù   Thanks referring I‚Äôm vaccinated.

So, pre-existing conditions all? keeping little extra weight around midsection? Perfect blood pressure? keeping cholesterol checks?

We‚Äôve mRNA vaccines injected people test cases since 2008 trying stay ahead pandemics. long, exactly, need, feel gut it‚Äôs safe? Israel reporting Pfizer losing efficacy?

Yeah, seems many countries Asia Pacific region simply necessary things Western world stuck debating procrastination. Risk everyone getting infected. Even vaxed carrier. Might kill you, pass someone might kill them.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

Meanwhile we're 3+ million deaths still going simultaneously creating breeding grounds virus mutate. limited research done long term effects virus body. 

No not. everyone reddit 24/7. reality longterm effects virus known know new variants do. downplay severity make bold claims based current literature. 

It's fear. reality situation. lot people still dealing fatigue, memory loss, myocarditis etc result contact virus. simply dont know yet effects different age groups severity plays long term. early say true, IMO.

The numbers previous days really tell us much holiday weekend. look days prior would see vaccinations actually increasing - average 750k (6/19 6/26) one million (6/27 7/3). first time doses also increased going 320k 460k periods time.

The vaccination numbers definitely coming stopped. And, one million doses DAY still pretty significant number considering almost 60% adults already final shot. That‚Äôs works. didn‚Äôt eradicate shit. Delta variant beat variants contagious. actually sign losing, winning. So, assumption true?

February felt like cold, January said bronchitis. Might covid. coughing lungs every night nearly month. Anti body testing area really available right summer.   Simple answer: Delta variant.  quite. Vaccinated people less viral load, fight virus faster. It‚Äôs harder mutate dies much quicker.  I‚Äôm similar situation - 15 month old born 34 weeks needed pacemaker. I‚Äôm trying cobble together childcare I‚Äôm scared send daycare. older children going back school person (hopefully masked!) full classrooms, college also requiring masks, social distancing, vaccines.

Imagine paying extra money opt Sinovac recognized effective vaccine several nations. Vaccine 64% effective COVID, though still significantly reduces severe hospitalizations. Ivermectin would idea though. Delta variant ridiculously optimized spreading environments like office, you‚Äôve lucky past every indication points luck running 2022, even 2023. I‚Äôm going sit tell 10%+ chance dying it, chances getting sick enough regret getting vaccine much, much higher risk death. Uhhh would like see study that‚Äôs extremely hard calculate  boggles conservatives (I spent weekend some) absolutely admit private conversation that, ""Trump badly mishandled pandemic rhetoric certain news stations absolutely resulted extremely low vaccination rates.""

The US could exporting donating longer problem.  many places going back ‚Äúnormal‚Äù despite spread delta, worried potential long term organ damage asymptomatic covid cases?

As parent two young children (2 4), particularly concerned lack data long term effects children. understand severe cases hospitalizations rare young children, seen significant studies check lung, heart brain damage.

From link posted:

GARCIA-NAVARRO: clear, studies seen, asymptomatic people actual effects could feel?

TOPOL: all. No, silent. idea. got results CAT scan lungs, surprised felt perfectly well. thing people heart inflammation - idea.

Anecdotally, best friend‚Äôs coworker asymptomatic case covid (regular testing pre-vaccines, surprised result). Healthy 25 y/o marathon runner. went run felt particularly winded mile 11. Apple Watch warned abnormal heart rhythm. took Uber hospital scanned heart found significant scar tissue. advised stop running. 

My daughter loves dance. fear one day tell cannot dance covid damaged heart. Lol, oh, they‚Äôre scientists?! suppose they‚Äôve got data back claims up? suppose data gathered clinical experiments repeatable results too?  2 1/2 people Florida. It‚Äôs since March Olympics haven‚Äôt started yet. think. people gotten vaccinated, we'd close done shit. no. Crybabies gotta cry. tons people moving NY Florida specifically Florida implement restrictions COVID thus ""free state"". answer nothing. IMO anyone refused vaccine refused hospital treatment Ive contemplating ‚Äúdifference‚Äù that‚Äôs seen numbers asymptomatic infection delta vs previous variants (approximately somewhere 64-79% range based varying data/studies) could largely function much easier delta find way people‚Äôs systems technically ‚Äúinfect‚Äù show positive highly reactive tests, intents purposes really ‚Äúcatching‚Äù covid.

If delta transmissible takes minutes (or even seconds Australia reports indicate) transmit, think stands reason viral particles circulating around transmit easier air might end people‚Äôs bodies therefore lead positive tests, really ‚Äútrue‚Äù infection. even so, probably keep viral load way lower clear infection faster.

What really keep focusing symptomatic disease, especially mRNA vaccines since that‚Äôs trials focused on. 94-95% efficacious symptomatic disease older variants, they‚Äôre 80-90+% delta, that‚Äôs really huge difference problem. 

Yeah, would nice 90% type infection, 64-79% still quite good may even number really along 90%+ type infection cdc study found may function relatively lower transmission rates viral prevalence. submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Yup. county 70% vaccinated. Im licking handrail wonder bubble 11% living in. think Vaccinated people ""shedding spike proteins"". Fear. virus. going away.

Nope, generally seen restrictive thing people tend try reducing it.


If fine it, whatever. saddest number ""40% expect lives ever normal again""

I certainly think number would zero, strikes incredibly pessimistic. hate many people seem lost hope. hope number incorrect. There's already 7 million fewer them, hurting demographics. Yes, so? suggest something state's horrific energy system. said states changed reporting. That‚Äôs outdoor holiday, virus seasonal, wouldn‚Äôt expect see surge anyways. I‚Äôm vaccinated work restaurant kind necessity. try safe one cares anymore I‚Äôm 20s point you‚Äôre vaccinated that‚Äôs you. said done, gonna 38%. basically make choice getting vaccine getting COVID. fact work maskless office probably puts risk 90-100% range considering Delta variant twice infectious original version Could provide link something this? true that‚Äôs huge oversight AU NZ mess much getting vaccines? like felt border controls could kick feet lazy it. YAY! IT!  [Here's CNN Can't find actual study yet since believe gets published later week, numbers yesterday. already see NL hospital admissions ICU occupancy stopped dropping dropping many weeks.

We grand total 212 corona patients Dutch hospitals (109 hospital clinics 103 corona patients ICUs), 236 yesterday. 

Hospital-wise things going great? think concerning thing individually may gotten symptoms even vaccine. know that‚Äôs unlikely. hurting you?? Think like this: people unfit profession fired left. slot open new people coming in. get refresh new doctors nurses hopefully newer wave people stupid.  don‚Äôt mask, you‚Äôre around others could potentially spread virus. You‚Äôre freeloader. Right?  ‚Ä¶ what? isn‚Äôt true. Please state fact. Fully vaccinated people spread virus Singapore. 

It‚Äôs thought fully vaccinated people spread significantly less  worked 12 hours yesterday I‚Äôm self employed phone whenever want. yes thing many ppl died life altering side effects make living disgraceful. genuine Q, youre vaccinated, go crowded bars/events (if thats thing)? really sick fucks site Agreed. morons get sympathy me. want ride atv hammered kill yourself? God bless you. endanger health stupidity? Fuck. You. mean, idea many Americans believe angels? That's completely wrong. Several variants gave least enhanced immune escape. Especially ""weaker"" vaccines like Sinopharm J&amp;J. pandemic epidemic infectious disease spread across large region, instance multiple continents worldwide, affecting substantial number people.

So maybe local epidemic control saying pandemic like saying dark everywhere don‚Äôt directly see sun right now.

Every unvaccinated people incubators new variants lot young people still don‚Äôt know uumderlying condition. father didn‚Äôt still passed away virus.

So bottom line it‚Äôs better save sorry. base pandemic restrictions groups extremely rare (adults can‚Äôt get vaccine) groups incredibly low risk. 

If adults risk rate kids wouldn‚Äôt bat eye, there‚Äôs thing ‚Äúkids‚Äù decide ignore everyone else think irrationally connotation children top cost care astronomical compared free dose. Actually 69% real lead cause didn‚Äôt know much stopped asymptomatic spread. assumed around 70% wasn‚Äôt really known. good know.  Cancel it! Major super spreader event waiting happen!  necessarily. used hold summer winter Olympics year, every four years. could go back that. Oh lot higher that. Huh, see heard Memorial day guess - spike less people vaccinated then. weirdos subreddit want pandemic continue badly. ""Freedom free"".

If afraid get one two doses vaccine, afraid expose family deadly virus every day, excercising freedom poorly. Hospital staff particularly bad lot medically uneducated, highly opinionated work. ""I know better doctor see every day"" argument. capitalizing word pandemic  yup... point, protected NPIs able make foolish choices like large unvaccinated gatherings amongst vulnerable people. stuff open, staying open cases allowed rise. I'd suggest anyone vaccine hesitant quickly change tact save could crippling bout virus. started lie last year! 

""Wearing mask prevents becoming socialist"" stand corrected ... said also remember places vulnerable (Republican leaning states low vaccination rates) essentially zero testing. We're flying blind. could like VIP room. 'Only vaxxed allowed' way people room would feel safer, surrounded smart enough get vaccine. Girls might go 'ah, vaxxed?? sweeet :)' Yeah get that. that‚Äôs vaccinated people‚Äôs fault. there‚Äôs hospitalization problem live cause live place high vaccination. bad fever muscles hurt 1 2nd Pfizer jab. time time (i know called English), muscles like ""lock up"" painfully, feel like I'm weaker. know what's that, going away slowly (the lock ups happen less often). variant develops far virulent current variants we're going pay heavy toll stupidity. fair, israel study came recently shows Pfizer 64% effective delta. 

So vaccine effective, still see outbreaks mid-high vaccinated parts country news - restrictions months now. study hasn‚Äôt fully released, right? leaked? often need tell people possible side effects vaccines *less risky* diseases themselves? *nothing* thinking ""cool"" pro-vaccine (which I'm sorry, juvenile, *idiotic* thing suggest). know CURRENTLY vaccinate children ? Here's quick rundown Canada's current regimen vaccinations (which believe similar US):

Diptheria, Polio, Hepatitis, Tetanus, influenza, rotavirus, bacterial meningitis, chicken pox, measles, mumps, rubella, HPV. 

Do need go on? COVID popped 50 years ago, would list above. never polio never known anyone who's it, take granted (well, *I* don't). mRNA vaccines *safer* technology available us circumvents need live virus vaccines vaccines *are dangerous* begin with. Certainly risks associated diseases *and* COVID outweigh dangers vaccination. Again. often said people get it? delusion, however, I'm optimal. 

Eh, define optimal. we're talking terms maximizing public health safety, sure, behaving perfect manner. we're talking terms reasonable person's response COVID, though, think behaving quite optimally.   

You got vaccinated likely encouraging vaccination others. That's optimal behavior. everyone behaved way, we'd track tremendously minimizing disease. think fair burden vaccinated people consequences COVID alternative holdouts simply getting shots.  Someone told seat belts actually increase likelihood die crash. I'm 99% certain person refusing Covid vaccine. conversation never stops there. top-level. Vaccine released 8 months. time get it. ploy opinions either mass neurological manipulation/mind control develop impressionable populace WEF‚Äôs Great Reset begins plant roots. AI era known 4th Industrial Revolution.

Oh truly believe this. Check view  guys US vaccines readily available everyone aside maybe Israel. countries far exceeding rates despite readily available vaccines far later. Certainly seems hitting ceiling that's sadly way low. contagious, personal risk depends behavior other

I get saying, point contention interesting twist describe it.

""...my personal risk depends behavior others"" vs ""...my personal risk low regardless others.."" proof personal. fact nearly eliminate chances death choosing get vaccinated powerful choice taken. could argued others choose get vaccinated care health. So, care health, you... especially since still protected? 


Granted, assume US everyone access, believe case. not, please correct me. 


As children getting vaccinated yet, tricky topic. However, fact death rate children extraordinarily low. anyone know death rate children 12? lower death rate vaccinated people? Thank this. Journalists always trying bury lede. possible vaccines actually work?  me, think view people completely changed. seeing many people didn‚Äôt believe covid/wouldn‚Äôt take precautions, lost lot faith humanity, don‚Äôt think coming back time soon. 40% realistic outlook public health. officially screwed pooch response virus dealing generations come. 

We short period put cat back bag like Sars. continue mutate spread point seen like typical flu, lot deadlier.

In Sweden countries. countries 1st wave died quickly, 2nd wave started rise quickly well.

I feel like part. get sick, feel bad. US plenty supply someone refuses it, that's completely deal consequences. Normally I'm fairly empathetic person comes people refuse get (I could understand early hesitancy think passed millions exceptionally rare issues). So, probably sounds crass, care point get sick die refused vaccine.  think over...for vaccinated people.

If anti-vaxxer holdout, may odds ever favor guess.   Typical outlook certain population. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs problem doesn‚Äôt impact personally‚Äù  happening flu.

its title ONE AMERICA number 1 Hospitalisations increasing, slowly before. means would good thing stay cautious instead becoming adventurous.

Nothing say contradicts fact common sense approach would keep mask mandates social distancing place situations public transport.

Polls show 71% British public support continued mask mandate public transport, 66% shops, etc. can't see government still pushing risky strategy.  mean long supposed live utter fear? 

If you‚Äôre vaccinated you‚Äôre safe ever be, really don‚Äôt blame say it‚Äôs them. Almost 100% hospitalizations deaths refuse vaccine.

I simply don‚Äôt know anti-vaxxers problem. I‚Äôm personally giving another second 20s stupid people.  would teach me?  data internal medical university I‚Äôm faculty. I‚Äôd assume it‚Äôs written peer-review. Public data reported county shows increase test positivity like 4% week two ago 11% currently.

Really? Isnt risk 12 ballpark flu? zero, back envelope might risk driving to/from airport covid.

Looks like 82 deaths 0-10 lets say 35M kids, 82 deaths. Thats 1:427K chance, basically year, MUCH higher covid rates wed expect next year. morality rate driving roughly 2:100M miles. drive 234 miles get kid vaccinated (plausible airport ends), kid would risk drive. Obviously kids big risk factors, godawful driver YMMV.    areas refused take action bear cost travel nurses doctors.

There‚Äôs emergency anymore. surge manufactured inaction people sick. military doctors still regular deployments regular patients care for.

My family got sick inaction, moved spring much better area hospital.

Nurses demand. Leave rural idiots ruin.  Israel announced Pfizer efficacy rates dropped 90% around 65%. high vaccinations rates. Olympics tens thousands athletes. sports mentioned plus more. new cases strains aren‚Äôt happening 5 months straight. commenting asking people whether fine want get it? must troll. hope get it; it'll good learning experience you. Sure do. Every time virus multiplies, chance genetic mutations. mutations likely relatively benign, one could cause virus resistant vaccines. Vaccines already lower efficacy delta variant (it still decent effectiveness, lower). gives virus chances mutate, potentially become even resistant vaccines daughter Indonesia's first president founder largest oxygen company passed away due Covid-19  Wait, mean three times separate instances, actually three times? vaccinated? get belief neither masks vaccine prevent transmission? I'm middle finding new job. way company dealt made realize give 2 shits me, would happily work death.

In fact, horrible inconvenience take care myself. strong! Congrats bet 7 others think pandemic hoax ""If cases rise vaccinated communities, that's bad.""

For sure. sad might think. among 40% intend wear mask public among strangers probably rest life.

Its bad. I've enjoyed getting sick year half. don‚Äôt want think I‚Äôm fine.   said anything world? US able walk Walmart get vaccine like four months. get chose to. restrict life indefinitely it. Everyone wants protection it.

And under-12s risk what? runny nose? dont think Pandemic.  think also air distrust Hillbilly mentality around.  40% probably sub lol üòÜ Im grateful born introvert half half American voted Donald Trump, doesn‚Äôt surprise me.

Meaning comment way one discussed correct, many people trying say. always correct, clarify 55% relative transmissible UK variant. risk goes directly proportional number cases area though. 10x many cases previous peak, much risk ever been. 
What I'm trying argue case number still matters, people still interest taking measures keep case numbers beneath certain level. see, make sense. thanks essentially is. everyone aside kids get vaccinated has, let rest antivaxxers get die. finally gotten first house 2019, pantry set aside, used COVID coming stock last Febrary. remind grandparents pantry, lived depression. way parents never pantry. wonder common become generation this.

(The ultimate irony? house fire March 12th last year. spent first 3 weeks hotel, anyway!) 3 ten 3 ten refuse get vaccinated? Because, well, pandemic never going end.  Normal necessarily better. life normal pandemic. better now. get i'm lucky i'm alone either ""3 10 Americans stupid"" Solidarity, friend. I'm also immune compromised vaccinated. Weird times. seen Him. 42. Elderly vaccinated people still get sick die covid. Yes, less before, still can. large portion youngsters haven‚Äôt vaccinated yet (not fault) spreading much elderly could die still despite vaccine. 

So government waited even 4 weeks, would represent something like what: 6 mil extra shot? possibly 3 mil extra fully vaccinated people? Basically would mean bunch people would less likely spread, etc etc. 

Anyways find Dutch government dropped ball one. isn‚Äôt like governments share mistakes well.  blame honestly. sign negative mental health effects pandemic caused. Larger numbers unvaccinated people basically breeding ground variants, though. takes one variant doesn‚Äôt use spike protein vaccine covers, we‚Äôre back March 2020. I'm getting worried delta variant. I'm vaccinated fools already gotten CDC. I'm fearing pandemic 2.0 absolutely incompetent leadership along way combination people refuse vaccinate.  first side correct. second side wrong, dangerously so.

Stop false equivalence nonsense. hope managers stop treating people like getting badge honor come work sick. work? outcompete? Especially there's immune evasion, can't get Delta Epsilon?

Theoretically, future, fight viruses creating strain safe ""outcompetes""? Yep. stupid-ass survey everyone keeps touting say 1 3 Americans definitely get vaccinated gets full approval. says 1 3 Americans would 'more likely' get vaccinated gets full approval. weasely language meant explicitly allow one backtrack commitments. 

Absolutely none 'vaccine-hesitant' people get shots full approval. Zero fucking percent. 3 billion doses administered worldwide, surprise surprise keep finding vaccines safe effective, end story. much data 'hesitant' people need? Three fucking billion enough? 

There thing vaccine 'hesitancy'. Anyone claiming point closeted anti-vaxxer want persecuted bullshit.  mostly agree that! 

If 70% reduction chance infection include decreased chance transmit infected well, would probably already able say even 100% vaccination, lot areas rising cases opened up. 

If good data estimating much less likely transmit are, would really helpful making predictions. think right sort ""If cases rise vaccinated communities, that's bad.""  Things see daily life still exist. never seen Ghandi daily life; mean exist. old you? 2 10 Americans live Texas. think pandemic over. feel like longer thing goes on

Do ever think going away? don't. Covid here, like flu... mitigate important. things, really much care/worry personally. I'm boat. life back exactly like pre-pandemic now. Attended grandmothers 90th bday couple weeks ago, planning vacation now.

Of course care still dying horrible disease, particularly people can't get vaccinated health reasons. see stats show people getting sick 90%+ people vaccinated (most _can_ vaccinated), hard worry vaccine readily available US. removal restrictions. bulk cases unvaccinated single dose people  Cool, curious.

Huh? dont understand this. would delta likely vaccine resistant?  test. hope don‚Äôt go back normal. hate office commuting work. South Korea gets vaccinate citizens earlier, israel gets vaccines later expiration date. win win everybody. sister going vaccinate kids full FDA approval - got vaccinated right away lot people harder jump vaccinate kids. literally never see people wearing masks. like 1 thousand people. mean, ratio gotta assume people political parties deciding wear them.  Anectdotal, parents currently sick Covid fully vaxxed month. not. rule law anything else says schools employers cannot currently mandate vaccinations, whether EUA otherwise. correct answer, jesus. working right now, there's suggestion delta may reached peaked fitness, idea probably minimum 6 months Travel us apply vaccine cvs Nothing life zero risk. 93% reduction serious harm covid reduces risk level things accept ignore regularly. Yes many employers going need change policies. current job worked places missed days counted missed much gone. never went merely fake points needed to. hope even jobs deemed esential policy still sick stay home Ah, rechecked article estimate, makes sense. standard tests come positive either variant? need take different test? Well... go. Understood, think people say pandemic aren‚Äôt really speaking clinical definition. 

When say selective pressure, mean virus circulates among easy targets (the unvaccinated) winds penetrating immune systems vaccinated? AMA virologist guy seemed suggest low possibility limited nature coronavirus‚Äô ability mutate. really case? avoid risks even high incidence rate country. waited Pfizer J&amp;J. avoid unnecessary interactions wear N-95 mask. Chance won‚Äôt get virus. lives never 9/11. certainly want continue wearing masks rest life whenever big crowds. alone means life never again. increasing numbers ‚Äúbreakthrough‚Äù infections vaccinated people 

Do source this? CDC stopped tracking total breakthrough infections months ago, able find solid source tracks information since US.  Thanks! appreciate it. huge relief.  understand liberal vaccinated say over. Yes may closer normalcy someone's vaccinated, still see social distancing encouraged stores people still wearing masks (especially store employees restaurant servers). think theaters back 100% capacity yet either. still parades fireworks yet Disney World.  ‚ÄúHeavy restrictions lockdowns‚Äù? It‚Äôs joke.

Nope! 1/3 adults state vaccinated even close. Except grown people don‚Äôt wear seatbelts get fined wearing it‚Äôs law.

Regardless let anti-vax people get sick. It‚Äôs them. inevitable uptick cases US, think we‚Äôll see walking back opening up? I‚Äôm CA feeling like things largely normal really struggling idea everything shutting again. children barely affected virus. death rate near zero them, asymptomatic rate extremely high.

Pretty messed happened poor staff afraid actively remove (they tried awful lot passive measures though). mates basically planning go every establishment Nottingham night. Herd immunity something. criminal.  That's literally recovery rate many groups people get virus itself. Yeah.. super super weird thought process (I hate even call that.. think there's lot ""thought"" behind it). 

The rich get richer tanking economy (and devaluing things process). That's nonsense (for dozens different reasons). 

There's many different conspiracy-theories share contradiction ""Believing X-group smart enough pull complex conspiracy,. simultaneously dumb enough allow discovered"".. Like.. make sense all. 

It's also hilarious conspiracy-theorists always seem follow attitude ""Well.. smart enough figure out"" (variation old ""I know something don't"" meme) 

I've always wanted make cheat-sheet Cognitive-Biases.. troll Conspiracy sub-reddits pointing particular cognitive-biases arguments representing.. always figured I'd get banned pretty fast :).. Sounds like Farnsworth ""Good news, everyone!"" setup. Even Japanese people don‚Äôt want Olympics. whole thing sad. hated masks first. hope stay normalized. Nope. vaccinated person gets virus viral load virus small even pass someone gonna tiny amount either get sick they'll asymptomatic body fight virus pretty quickly. include deaths spanning back vaccines approved/administered, sample like month June? I'm curious, expect high proportion  travelling around Europe - good time?  vaccine work passerby sneezing relatives carrying covid, immune system cannot deal gigantic single dose acutely ill patient, even can, doctors see daily basis. means come point stadium 33% full next round fill entirely

Math nitpick (sorry): 

That's quite accurate. doubling exponential rate, would jump 33% 66%. follows growth initial drops: 1, add 2 = 3, add 4 = 7, add 8 = 15, add 16 = 31 (close 33%), add 32 = 63. increment basically running total point + 1 whatever starting unit was. 33%, next increment would 33% + 1 drop, giving 66% + 1 drop.

If 50%, would jump 100% (+ 1 drop). get 33% 100% need 3x exponential growth instead 2x. heard today children private boy's school Abbott 10 top tier LNP leaders attended, recieved pfizer vaccination ahead rest us. rollout truly rich mates priority Strong **community** immunity still important. It‚Äôs vaccination programs exist. 

When people say Covid becoming endemic like flu, remember: 

We hundreds years endemic immunity flu, **plus** half-century vaccine development, **plus** seasonal vaccines billions people take every year. 

Covid novel disease **without** benefits; that‚Äôs getting vaccinated Covid **right now** matters.

We still unmitigated spread kids age 12 unvaccinated adults, example. Escape immunity already happening.

e: vaccines definitely working then. current 7 day average new cases Maine 18 per day still trending down. either Delta made yet vaccines nearly completely solve problem.  Cases already going up. 14-day average US 14%.

And children. many young children can't vaxxed. current pace vaccination, October we'll almost full coverage. still useful exports such, benefits vaccination campaign quite limited, mostly second doses potential third doses, needed.  live county California high vaccination rates, order 85% eligible population. Yesterday day before, California reported 0 deaths COVID-19.

It's bubble can't remember last time ICU beds availability topic discussion. kid 12, unable get vaccinated yet, going many things indoors, avoid places people wearing masks indoors sake. rate hope sweet well fall/winter cold flu months, hope vaccine available kids 12 soon fall (might wishful thinking early).

I cannot understand people vaccinated getting vaccinated point. beyond insanity divide. God deemed so. Send thoughts prayers (eye roll). Protecting endangered risk animals sounds like good idea. is, zoo animals, agricultural animals, pets received various vaccinations decades. sure wear car yourself. Thats gets people! Yep.

And normalised used things, too:

On days air pollution high.

On cold days makes breathing outside ""warmer"".

Girls wear want put makeup; common around exam season university students wear baseball hats masks. See, unvaccinated type people also stay home pandemic. excited tend think virus either real way overblown anyway. Anecdotally, I'm starting see hold-outs around finally get vaccinated. know Delta variant enough time passed they've seen people around get vaccinated fine - both, probably. 

But last couple weeks, I've started seeing hesitant people finally stick arm - including MIL, honestly thought would never get it. Granted, texted husband picture vaccine card text ""I hope make this"" - hey, least got shot. 

Once vaccines approved younger kids (hopefully early fall), expect we'll see pretty big spike too. know friends young kids, kids able get vaccinated they'll consider pandemic officially them. So, letting anyone UK then? Oakland Zoo begun vaccination program inoculate highest risk animals COVID-19 experimental vaccine authorized United States Department Agriculture (USDA). Agreed dumb dangerous say over. true mRNA vaccine (as right least) puts people risk greater bad chest cold people live lives normally again. long Covid still tiny fraction world vaccinated, going run problems.   Yeah, whine restrictions refuse thing could end would ridiculous, right?  THOUGHT‚Ä¶ hope so, unfortunately small number people unvaccinated able mount immune response still fairly significant small % millions people. healthcare systems workers still suffering previous waves backlogs PTSD etc. Hopefully cope. know there's alternative think prepare tough. Again? Really? there's multiple free effective vaccines?

I like events

I like seeing elderly family members

I like later eight pm

I like living Paid testing? time home? Sounds like took advantage system bit. USA, testing free local pharmacy you‚Äôre expected get tested time. dumbasses would wear masks. many lives sacrificed put risk. Alpha became known December. first stuff alpha. science ignoring. spout data fit narrative. 

Did know 84.7 percent statics made up? dumb listened to. Even way UK letting virus burn young people elderly risk majority vaccinated, it‚Äôs clear herd immunity going achievable‚Äîsome estimates indicate we‚Äôd need something like 88% population immune, delta variant‚Äôs current R 8. think UK get there, 2021. 

However, UK continue reopen long NHS handle hospitalizations generated current spread, seems like continue do. Sucks anyone vaccinated that‚Äôs probably it‚Äôs going go down. *peep delta‚Ä¶* what's boy Pfizer  Honestly, PRECISELY motivation. crazy getting vaccine soon able breathe far away biggest fear. 

The threat suffocation enough override hesitancy.  Yes, Netherlands small densely populated. Germany, always rural pockets somewhere vaccination centres elderly people found difficult travel far. becomes issue ""rural"" area gets - like mountaineous regions Eastern Germany, example, higher share elderly people potentially even less developed public transport infrastructure.

The issue trust. lot people, including elderly particular, want GP given shot, stranger warehouse.

The final straw booking system vaccination centres overly complicated always overwhelmed demand. Again, people find easier contact local GP, etc., etc. Mine elevated since recovering June 2020. Even medication, doctors hard time getting close pre-covid numbers. Please take care yourself! feel like live year half life-changing events expect everything go back would weird thing. It‚Äôs slow process HIPAA concerns. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll get out. Peer-review also slower. Information deluge concern since beginning. Thankfully, mRNA vaccine tech near miracle level.

It would take Moderna/Pfizer&amp;BioNTech like week modified variant vaccine covers strains. far longest delay red tape waitng approvals. think mRNA tech require changes approval process.

Stuff like influenza could literally wait see variants currently ramping combo vaccine shortly after. need wait year approvals case. 

If release vaccine COVID slightly modified spike protein, right away manufacturing/distribution. Yes Singapore too! hope even thought aggressive flu go outside infect others. feel like that's major problem taken COVID seriously. spreading around regard anyone else. everyone taken seriously vaccines, might even now. do, data coming studies UK Singapore show 80-90% reduced symptoms match Canada‚Äôs study. Israel outlier far. doesn‚Äôt make sense. 

Let‚Äôs say 93% reduction serious harm comes 0.07% chance dying hospitalized covid age group. 

Imagine every time run someone covid you‚Äôre rolling many, many sided die 0.07% chance landing side says ‚ÄúGo Directly Hospital‚Äù. 

This fine you‚Äôre rolling dice twice even two dozen times day. Ultimately 99.93% chance hitting unlucky side roll. 

But start running hundreds thousands people covid, you‚Äôre rolling many dice, many times. 

So eventually you‚Äôll hit unlucky side. much likely high community spread. likely thoughts. push comes shove ventilator engaged, patient usually put induced coma. Delta significantly transmissible though? higher R0, fewer eligible vectors needed rapid spread. see, thank clarification. 

Im sure plenty reasons don‚Äôt make data available public, definitely annoyance it‚Äôs easily able viewed. lower end jobs definitely. there's also culture higher end stuff. Americans even tend take vacation days much less sick days. great thing wishful thinking virus listens cares. think lot people left sub last weeks lot left obsessed COVID.   Agreed. on, anytime cold, wear mask. probably also wear one planes on. 

Never aware viruses spread.  positively delightful cold year. never, keep waiting Right. see pessimistic statement fact. Life really go back way pre-pandemic. may positive change like always mask I'm sick keep mask good week symptoms gone. not? help prevent spread illness others takes mask that's easy decision. No. üòé Obviously new variants appearing - among immunocompromised people. delta variant already mutated somewhere. question future viability new mutations. new mutants encounter people vaccinated, maybe vaccine didn‚Äôt provide full protection person whatever reason, mutants ‚Äúescape potential‚Äù privileged find potential success subsequent people/hosts. already know virus mutated multiple times, I‚Äôd understand expert‚Äôs opinion. I‚Äôm likely defer virologist viral potential long coheres available knowledge. Also, hear regularly expert virologists university uninformed *their* views viral mutations future concerns. It‚Äôs novel scenario hard prognosticate about, even folks decades experience - much me. Getting rid virtual options longer requiring masks lack planning really shines. Except place live 80% fully vaccinated rate, even unvaccinated people extremely minimal risk contracting disease, especially vaccinated person. exhausting vaxxed places country, still stigma wearing masks, even restrictions lifted.  I've told, R0 changes based precautions take. original strain, precautions (no mask wearing, social distancing) taken R0 high 6 studies. curiosity, testing done States? free? I've abroad whole time.

The biggest impediment getting sick time lot jobs I've US always getting doctor's note. Seems jobs really make also provide insurance pay enough afford visit. Granted left ACA came in. Narrator: vaccinated people Sounds pretty opinionated objective piece Isnt risk 12 ballpark flu?

Perhaps, get kids flu shots Looks like 82 deaths 0-10 2020.

Deaths COVID fairly rare general. What's much common long-lasting perhaps permanent problems due long COVID. Here's [one fairly known Evidence first study long covid children suggests half children aged 6 16 years old contract virus least one symptom lasting 120 days, 42.6 per cent impaired symptoms daily activities.

In general though, enough research know exactly symptoms likelihood kids face terms long covid. personal level, know kid athlete high school, got COVID early year, still breathing problems. know adults got last year still things like near constant headaches, breathing problems, etc.

So me, like anything else vaccines for, seems like best course action get children vaccinated soon possible. Obviously, ""possible"" part includes sufficient clinical trials completed data evaluated point seem mostly focused dosage children 12 rather general efficacy safety.  know statistic citing (32% asymptomatic) symptoms 0-10 days post-covid, right?

I see medical records self-reported symptoms different self-reported symptoms - clarify? tell doctor I'm experiencing insomnia, accurate answer study survey saying same?

The point absolutely zero idea scale here, *only* study control group scale nonexistent, indicating extremely small group who's actually experiencing long covid (among children, least, among cohort actually experienced minor symptoms). trying draw conclusions something zero way provide conclusions. absolutely true research required, another dozen papers control group tell us anything. Yeah like corporate become years people rehashing again. God knows what's put people years intended be. That‚Äôs shoe sadly expect drop sometime winter. Could I‚Äôm super pessimistic though. fucking lolzy. reasoning wins Self-Awarewolves forever variants start feel like Shepards tone Yeah, consider far I‚Äôm concerned. point, vaccinated, it‚Äôs essentially risk personally. also concerned passing high risk person ‚Äî vaccine freely available anyone, months, still unvaccinated, made bed far I‚Äôm concerned. also seeing data kids, thing really basically ‚Äújust flu‚Äù, it‚Äôs longer worth keep kids locked home, missing crucial social development time (they 1 4).

So depending question phrased, could answer either way ‚Äî pandemic obviously over, far I‚Äôm concerned, over. never going right now. I‚Äôm guessing 30% aren‚Äôt vaccinated  agree sentiment bringing. also willing US sponsor number countries free vaccines. fact strongly encourage obvious reasons. longer bearing life. people vaccinations spreading disease, typically succumbing disease, meeting vaccinated people significant chance impacting anyone negative way.  Old busted: Delta Plus

New hotness: Lambda variant folks libertarian. requires degree consistency thinking approach lack. people thread mindless regurgitation talking heads part broad cult personality ""anti other"". 

While get ""true communist"" ""true libertarian"" ""true whatever"" argument, vaccination - even government mandated vaccination - entirely consistent libertarianism one takes consistent viewpoint around non-aggression principle foundational libertarian perspectives. cannot control cells; getting vaccinated inherently aggressive act *do* get infected - outside completely locking away society impractical - harming others. Paradoxically, chances life going back normal improves people acknowledge problems persist, even post-vaccine. claim abruptly return-to-normal decreasing chances long-term return-to-normal. Perhaps unavoidable appetite preventative measures waned, live fact we‚Äôll never get back before. Pretending problems exist national pastime. end, realistically? 

When children get vaccine? that? even then, people less likely inject something government kids still relatively ""new"" virus that's consistently mutating. 

What's end game? send kids back school? still pods? pods Delta 4x infectious? go back wearing mask. long??

I fully onboard wearing mask, point, - exhausting. I've done ""right"" thing still fucked up. people want nothing get ‚Äúback normal‚Äù. Yet won‚Äôt take hour time (and cases, free PTO work) go one extremely small free thing help us get back normal sooner. topic explored quantitatively. There's relationship, hardly reliable. see Figure 2:

[Can reactogenicity predict immunogenicity COVID-19 [Figure Two data points - one internal; one public. 

The internal data show increasing number breakthrough cases - is, cases among people vaccinated. source declaration. 

The implication increased public trend, one, cases increasing publicly shared data. ancillary point. understand right fully vaccinated reduces chance infection 30% -ish.

Does catching virus raise percentage? people going get covid like 7 times? Probably he's neither vaccines pro drunk driving.
I'm totally pro vaccine best educate friends even strangers matter get vaccinated.
But I'm also totally forcing anyone take vaccines. body decision, counts people too, including uneducated stupid ones. I'm fully vaccinated still wear mask work. So, I've kept habit. places city signs say fully vaccinated wear mask. But, enforced. judge many people city fully vaccinated observing would think high 90%'s. sure point trying make shifting words around. But, meant risk dependent others past 15 months. Yes, vaccine powerful protection, others still spreading still mutating. 

As children, please, death negative outcome COVID. Cases long-COVID children rising, Delta variant looks like worse children. pretty much everything going back precovid mode, sure France many countries fear covid I‚Äôm really lost understanding efficacy measured reduction compared unvaccinated control group. 

You‚Äôre saying actually don‚Äôt compare breakthrough cases unvaccinated control measuring efficacy? 

Rather group vaccinated people tested positive well didn‚Äôt long similar exposure virus? measure group unvaccinated people tested positive? 

You‚Äôre saying severe disease rate breakthroughs high you‚Äôre vaccinated. know case based mountains data opinions doctors. Three separate times: March 2020, June/July 2020, June 2021 (they still sick 3 weeks later). three sick time. instance actual positive test followed negative recovery.

No, anti-vaxx, anti-lockdown, (were) anti-mask. Even this, still think/treat COVID nothing aggressive flu God protect from. arm hurting 2 days tired 3-4 days first Pfizer. curious 2nd dose bring. Singapore study asymptomatic infection small, said prevented Delta asymptomatic infection 69%. 

I know doesn‚Äôt sound great that‚Äôs actually really fucking good, since it‚Äôs much harder pas virus don‚Äôt symptoms. 12-15 data shows us anything parents going vaccinate kids. 1/3. 2016 Trump got least 1/3 vote. Corruption aside, even Hillary won, Trump absolutely got 1/3. Coincidence? problem countries papers faked like hell, difficult check them, many enter probably protected Yeppppp. I‚Äôm vaccinated, family vaccinated, life torn apart covid fallout. I‚Äôm zero percent limit exposure anything - I‚Äôm traveling, going dancing, living life fully.

I give zero fucks protecting people chosen get vaccinated. pandemic basically US vaccines widely available months. get sick didn‚Äôt get shots, it‚Äôs you. Three ten Americans never believed existed first place. essentially 1st world countries. rest world? Ummm, long shot. pandemic probably beginning 3rd world.

Will ever economically same? No. I'm even sure culturally ever again. 

Certainly, international travel tourism never same.

Maybe 10 years might sort paradigm shift medicine sort technological shift doubt singularity, overall effect industry certain point, something akin hyper-automation basically automate shipping to-door.

I think might hit brick wall mineral resources climate change. mean, depends mean ""normal"". things opened like use without restrictions? Sure. personal level? pre-covid life over. never coming back. pandemic greatly affected personal/emotional level point see pre-pandemic almost entirely separate person. Plus rent's point get roommate now, 30+, that's going change go back ""normal"" either. 

And expected ""get therapy/meds"" replies, already that. fact never part ""never normal again"" me.   things think always stay me. Frequent hand sanitizing greater sense social distancing public. enjoyed even cold 18 months. 

This one things 50 years younger people explain quirky things saying ""they lived COVID"". 
Yeah vaccinated fine manage tradeoff beyond level expertise, would guess ability manage risk depends things like: 

- job: example, hospital workers still get sick even N95s, albeit much lower rates

- wait time till different vaccine: pretty short US could months countries.

- living situation: avoidance lot harder housemates may cautious are.

Glad worked you, though :) top isn‚Äôt effective delta

You know know foggiest clue heck talking about?  see variant evades vaccine anytime soon

Definitely not, media fearmongering unfortunately evidences rule long Covid effects great majority vaccinated people, using FFP3 (equivalent N99) spend hours people. Better spending years home see accept even low risks right away Fear death, yes. Thats me. Corona stay decades. wont kill many we're vaccinated 9/10 acting way seems Three reasons: 

* Japan's current vaccination rates low compared countries mentioned - going rise materially games.
* Delta changed game relates threshold herd immunity (and, lesser extent, vaccine efficacy). 
* scale Olympics much greater events (for part) - although limiting international spectators may help last bit. global south access Pfizer see variant evades vaccine anytime soon? stress variants quite often. Ill getting JNJ vaccine 2 weeks nice world isn‚Äôt saying that‚Ä¶ first world countries tons mRNA vaccines saying that. Okay, things here.

1. right article symptoms. non-PDF version 'full text' omits tables, looked PDF version found them. 

2. There's still critical distinction two studies. one linked take steps screen much could non-covid symptoms. end, required symptoms persist 50 days more, and: ""...symptoms reported within year prior testing positive SARS-CoV-2 excluded analysis,"". study used existing medical records, purely self reported. important distinction.

3. point could confusion contamination Non-Covid sources valid. claim two articles rely methods information gathering not. important distinctions, admit 32% number one I'd consider unquestioningly accurate.

4. said, worth pointing original intent posting article correct someone claiming Long Covid could come Asymptomatic cases, 'that covid worked'. still feel confidant claims factually incorrect. may actually 32%, enough cases diagnosed 'Long Covid' asymptomatic infection bear cause osme patients, even actual percentage question. Many probably lost someone pandemic. mean, course nothing ever normal case. agree completely. Almost breakthrough positive cases vaccinated people caught routine testing (mandatory testing travel, schools, media, etc) people sick. people testing positive really sick‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs point shouldn‚Äôt matter anymore. We're terrified dude. basically habit issue wear one, especially I'm around people know they're vaccinated not. (More safety mine) yeah, near impossible get hospitalised unless obese asthmatic sounds really scary note covid hospitalizations still 95% January. January 60,000 cases day 40,000 people hospital, right 25,000 cases day 2,000 hospital. great progress.  Yes, we've already established incredibly stupid people US watching last 4 years antics. Well that's sad 3/10 think over. Also sad 4% democrats think over. guess asked full USA locally live covid that's matter. can't care people get vaccine anymore. That‚Äôs I‚Äôve saying, except raptures away brains. Lol askreddit thread masks day people unironically thinking life lockdowns distancing forever part Georgia people think everything fine. Many relatives still got vaccines. Many still wearing masks etc. I'm looking MD dashboard says 12-17 50% vaccinated (at least one dose). Netherlands! totally right!

Any new predictions? likely. Japan vaccine rollout slow. indication Olympic workers vaccinated. athletes tested positive vaccinated according reports. turn affect AU whole spiral control.  People acting like guarantee get infected vaccinated, minor symptoms. 

I think people's attitude towards it, descriptions it, reflect 80% reduction chance hospitalized infected. 

People saying rise cases longer matters, people vaccinated. accurate say rise cases vaccinated people matters like 20% much before? 
The number people absolutely discrediting number cases important anymore seems reckless me. true. vaccines still effective delta variant. Friend friend connected public health high level said there's already prepwork winter booster year. Idk it'll required, least they're preparing it. let‚Äôs gooo baby. work decent number people long covid reported feeling better vaccine. One assume vaccine helps prevent long covid then. course breakthrough infections. end world something one simply come terms with. potentially sway number breakthrough infections little bit there, we're still years away likely COVID literally non-issue. mentally accept that. People hate hearing true feel exactly way. dastardly ploy too, keep people safe deadly disease...

Reddit diverse site. absolutely nooks crannies contain awful, stupid people. I'd bet house average Redditor far intelligent compassionate people post Fox News. Still waiting something concrete long covid breakthrough infection. know kind info takes time collect, 6-7 months least give us hints.

Maybe concern paranoid degree, know asymptomatic mild infections lead long covid, mild asymptomatic infections completely prevented vaccination. We‚Äôd need answer whether there‚Äôs something different immune response vaccinated individuals uniquely prevents long covid. course, we‚Äôd also need know mechanism long covid first place.

This may end like strep throat, name game decimate moment it‚Äôs detected. may best way prevent long covid first avoid getting covid, get it, throwing kitchen sink right away, ASAP, whether vaccinated not. feel like don‚Äôt full kitchen sink yet, though we‚Äôre close. still lack one tool covid, accessible reliable antiviral early infection. matter time variants blow vaccinated population.

Oof. would love post form question r/COVID19 daily thread. survey cited seems greatly disagree good chunk can‚Äôt get time work worried missing days work

Man, job Poland hooked us Pfizer vaccines could go Saturday day get jabs. Good thing got vaccines huh  Ah yes table doesn‚Äôt take account vaccines obviously imagined. 

Apologies error, thought read article last week Pfizer vaccines overtaken AZ UK. We're going able definitively answer longer. Yup, might good idea. selfishly good thing people vaccinated since many idiots America want vaccinated, soon booster needed/available, get immediately. 

I feel like personal protection always remain really high, idiots want vaccines eventually get hit virus. Well lucky? know, seems like sizable number people moving California Texas lean conservative, and, such, less likely vaccinated. always going happen. never going 4 lockdowns. going indefinite indefinite period time. liquor store begs disagree. NZ govt far less authoritarian US. never even mask mandate. refused one despite scientists urging repeatedly. Even high alert levels recommendation. 

The govt also quick reverse previous restrictions. They've surrendered control repeatedly. Even highest levels govt refused charge blatant rule breakers. Police arrest people blatantly broke lockdown rules front them, gave verbal warnings. 

On borders relaxed opening Australia public even wants. keen open much possible. govt system ranks least corrupt transparent world multiple watchdog surveys many years. worries abuse powers this. 

I grew US would never trust federal state govts lived there. worries NZ govt. gonna full blown though. Vaccinated people fine, we're gonna see get bad last year. bad though unless something changes.

Remember we'll also likely get vaccine approval 12s soon, make situation better. rest world gets access vaccines, expect things like new variants slow also.

Things looking up, slow. Could care less people refusing get vaccine, ‚ÄòBill GaTeS PuT trAcKing deVicE iT‚Äô dies.

There every reason take vaccine. outcomes coronavirus infection far worse outcomes vaccine AGE GROUPS. indisputable fact. 

Furthermore virus contagious disease. pass vulnerable people kill them. vaccine contagious disease. Thank height pandemic, easy worry strangers would give virus. new study happened people‚Äôs birthdays suggests people trust also common source viral spread.

Private gatherings harder researchers measure big public events ‚Äî they‚Äôre private, all. been¬†[a fierce months among epidemiologists big factor coronavirus moved person person.

But researchers Harvard, RAND Corporation Castlight Health used creative method finding them: Using health insurance claims data, looked Covid rates families two weeks one birthday. Overall, published Jama Internal Medicine, found recent family birthday increased Covid risk nearly third counties virus widespread.

Their theory increased risk almost certainly explained birthday parties. Though insurance claims don‚Äôt show whether individual Covid patient actually held birthday party, several aspects data strongly suggest connection.

For one, researchers looked days year randomly assigning birthdays instead using actual birthdays, examined diagnoses weeks birthdays, found pattern. But, perhaps significantly, found biggest infection risk weeks birthday child.


‚ÄúMy wife I, certainly didn‚Äôt see need gather indoors birthdays,‚Äù said Anupam Jena, professor health policy Harvard Medical School one paper‚Äôs authors, said study inspired daughter‚Äôs birthday. ‚ÄúOur kids might disappointed.‚Äù

Birthday parties, course, often involve groups huddling close quarters, perhaps watch child blow candles cake.


July 5, 2021

The study considered data last year, Covid much common fewer Americans vaccinated. conclusions still relevant Americans unvaccinated today ‚Äî group includes children 12. may especially true new, contagious Delta variant begins circulate states.

Many political debates managing pandemic centered public spaces ‚Äî like whether restaurants allowed open, whether masks required. Public officials harder time policing people‚Äôs behavior home. They‚Äôve also struggled measure effects.

K.J. Seung, chief strategy policy Partners Health‚Äôs Massachusetts Covid response, helped set contact tracing system, said hard contact tracers clearly demonstrate people contracting virus small private gatherings.

Public exposures, like factory wedding, easier track. Individuals often didn‚Äôt share nights cousin dinner drove friend home work, whether shame forgetfulness ‚Äî did, reluctant name names.

‚ÄúSmall social gatherings difficult locations trace,‚Äù said. Yet ‚Äúwhen talked contact tracers around country, like: Yeah, people getting infected small gatherings.‚Äù

So much behavior around pandemic ‚Äî including¬†[mask the¬†[uptake appears differ people‚Äôs political party. study found birthdays led increased Covid infections similar levels Republican Democratic areas country. suggests although Democratic-leaning households may likely wear mask walking dog, may differed less Republicans comfort trusted friend visit.

‚ÄúThere definitely element home safe place therefore friends family home, doesn‚Äôt feel risky,‚Äù said Dr. Ashish Jha, dean School Public Health Brown University, described paper ‚Äúcreative‚Äù finding unusual way capturing disease transmission otherwise hard measure.

For many Americans, birthday parties gotten much safer recent months. Centers Disease Control Prevention says it‚Äôs safe fully vaccinated people gather indoors without wearing face coverings.

But remain unvaccinated, study reminder even activities feel safe pose threat infection. many parts country, unvaccinated people clustered region social group, meaning birthday parties ‚Äî festive, private occasions ‚Äî still risky. Yeah, people situation along: limit interactions mask up. sounds strange pvcs maybe ask yr Dr beta blocker could help. since started taking metoprolol. started medication pvc would drive nuts. sleep everytime started drive heart would skip gallop. sleep like baby  basically trying say. Sometimes feels like sub rooting vaccines. think depends at. fair friends, local clinic Sinovac, said AZ.

I basically zero side effects worth reporting. funny almost \*everybody\* know said got sick, put lot older them.

I've bit skeptical Indonesia reporting - media clearly hard outbreak - starting look genuinely bad (though still third per capita India got to). I'm particularly surprised increasing numbers Bali, there's high vaccination percentage high immunity based last year's seroprevalence numbers. science peak Bali soon, doesn't, think look Sinovac's weak first jab effectiveness Delta explanation. think would consider PA terrorist organization (they Hamas) definitely corrupt beholden purse masters Iran. must've received serious pressure Tehran back deal addition pressure internally support Hamas...    Simply true. Singapore high vaccination rates mRNA they‚Äôre still seeing tons asymptomatic spread even via fully-vaccinated tracing/tracking infections US truly know much spread via vaccinated individuals. think OP referring population, population fortunate vaccine available them, refuse it. Delta plus spread like Delta...it problem. ""Alpha Plus"" - where'd go? Yes, better evading vaccines/immunity, certain mutations evasion ability transmission slowed. People got infected variants first, developed immunity, limited spread evasive variants. 
 
Beta (S. African) still best lowering neutralization moment. That's stuck 2% overall cases US many months. 
 
The idea we're going constantly seeing worse worse variants fearmongering. limited amount advantageous mutations. Many mutations popping independently different areas. like virus ""learning"" - arise chance. Speed seems biggest danger. Delta super quick spreading.....will another come along that's faster new antivax infections/breakthrough cases add immunity herd? point, no. We're likely close point. Moderna updated booster evasion anyway - fall (mRNA 1273.351) Herd immunity coming. either come easy way hard way. said we‚Äôd full blown shit hitting fan August. far I‚Äôm wrong. Yep. majority people world aren‚Äôt yet given choices get vaccinated matter much desire get vaccinated. throw privilege die, it‚Äôs natural selection. It‚Äôs sucks decision hurts society though. That's fair point, know full get, would imagine distancing do, go somewhere less known crowded. &amp;#x200B;

[UK reports highest number new COVID cases since Jan. Agreed. access primary data? Pfizer vaccine, effectiveness preventing infection calculated as:

1 - (%vaccinated infected / %control infected.)

Whereas effectiveness preventing hospitalisation calculated as

1 - (%vaccinated hospitalized / %control hospitalized)

Wait, you‚Äôre right. Well since alpha ~50% transmissible original wild type delta ~%55 alpha 100% yes twice much original. know particular ""news"" station thank that. mention separate slices eat. One always grabs crust adjacent slice plan eating, separate slice plan eating.

That's global pandemics work, American ideology aside. vaccines seem holding well, great news, enough people taken US seems reckless uncoordinated response outset. We're even tracking breakthrough infections, compared countries like Israel, basing handle suppression tactics kind close monitoring. sets us dealing ongoing consequences vaccine tearing half country that's unvaccinated ill-equipped deal new developments, domestically globally.

The pandemic likely ""over"" sooner countries Pacific followed strong suppression strategies getting populations vaccinated. suppression strategies likely remain place time put better position rapid response toward localized outbreaks dangerous variants. What's LoD though? met qualifications, approved. met qualifications, be. approved necessity - makes approval carry meaning, IMO Yeah, lot factors here, trusting Israel's data. wait see verdict data actually released. seems doubt amongst experts, actually eyes data- picture become clearer.  like attitude ‚ù§Ô∏è  7-day average daily new case count shot 1,300% end May now. July 6 UK reported 28,000 new cases. So.... reconcile? vaccinated? guess based assumption organizers Olympic games Japanese Internetional one would responsible enough stop games cases would skyrocket high enough especially cases Delta Delta+ variants continues show Japan.

But im ready proved wrong parties deceide go way end competition point. Also mean 1% people 50 FULLY vaccinated still get die variant... need reach herd immunity people need wear masks shit again... Yeah awesome wait 3 months yet government send 2.5mil Indonesia plus even aid kill people PNG sly Australian government fucking joke. two parties ones ever get voice? you‚Äôre either right wrong? either money not? either wear mask not?

People see black white every aspect life think like contrarians inconveniences  considered fully vaccinated 2 weeks second dose COVID: ‚ÄúJoke‚Äôs you, I‚Äôm still testing mutations you!‚Äù Reddit news service. social media platform. thing. moved country high vaccination rates required athletes coaches vaccinated. seems like wrong way go things.

Nice hehe So, exactly delta variant? anyone ""TLDR"" versus SARS-COVID-(2) think? commonly called COVID-19 Overblown. spread nearly quick (similar Beta) - going compete Delta, time reaches states/etc people pretty good immunity.

There good enough argument require masks vaccinated Americans right now. I'll mask distance friends varient becomes notably deadly vaccinated people.

I'm going mask anti vax crowd. hanging around immune compromised crowd. group people knows stay home due anti vax crowd. No, that‚Äôs wrong, look primary data. You‚Äôre making mistake he‚Äôs highlighting comment. 

They look outcomes across pools people (vaccinated/not vaccinated). 100 cases severe disease distributed across two evenly sized groups (10000 vaccinated/10000 unvaccinated) we‚Äôd expect 93 non-vaccinated group, 7 vaccinated. extra frustrating shit happening Houston area expect people act know better. can't look percentage 18 vaccinated people aged 16 17 eligible 2 months ago, still people 12-17 eligible. Looking 12-15 group, 32% vaccinated. great, could see larger portion younger kids getting vaccinated doctor more, getting vaccinations already, going places health professionals encouraging vaccination. age 12, really going doctor matter routine like younger.

All said, people expect huge boom vaccinations, we're going see overwhelming coverage among young kids. little late You‚Äôre Reddit sir, heck would expect opinion downvoted I've many comments removed using name even funny, even context ""Trump said _____ press release."" thought might shadow-banned something, lol.

Well, guess Reddit spoken, fifth wave coming! 55 % people sounds bit low. really hope end 2022 80 % plus whole world. ideally USA rich developed country world average then. Would unvaccinated severe disease? infections happening almost entirely among unvaccinated population, due part fact younger adults (who likely gather groups get infected) became eligible quite recently. think largely Canada observe Delta-driven surge, provinces opened 18+ cohorts mid late May timeframe; 12+ early June. may proven early enough get ahead curve, literally figuratively. Competitive exclusion principle entered chat. 0% bold claim  ""heroes"" Tell selfish without telling selfish reality rest world hits sort steady state well. still exists place world variants could mutate either enforce strict quarantine ""not over"". You‚Äôd better waiting till next year Getting fully vaccinated mean you. virus keeps spreading eventually find ways defeat vaccine. reckless uncoordinated American culture nutshell.  think say yet UK cases still increasing. Netherlands arguably open fewer people vaccinated. Oh good. they‚Äôll fine, support staff, cleaning crew, food service workers, etc., Japanese, get infected  think Walgreens promo get gift card least 5 dollar coupon getting shot. Free money shot' not? thought trump endorsed taking vaccine. ""It's great vaccine, safe, something works"" Yup, that's wife. We're able small family friend gatherings like do. shop safely, go work necessary etc. fully understand we're far - effectively life returned normal minus going concerts. Switzerland requiring COVID tests vaccinated departure arrival, seems concern addressed. no, reported successful campaign Oh seemed improved lately. Still rather risky low infection rates Japan had. masking extremely low margin help toward solution problem. math risk assessment think forcing vaccinated people wear mask feasible. extremely diminished return risk avoidance. extreme danger face without masking anti vax crowd.

Sadly avoid public either way anti mask people catch get vaccinated. Asking vaccinated people continue masking even going help situation. big ask macro level small result. 

You already know safe 30%+ Americans vaccinate crowds unmasked. put me.

Stuff won‚Äôt give population preaching choir. doubt  trying make case zero instances people vaccine Trump? might best grammar least enough common sense get Springfield.  Thank laugh. :) would love hear know certainty. definitely would rather worry getting booster! barely makes sense.

What could see flare ups smaller lockdowns/event shutdowns certain areas. number states even gotten 40% fully vaccinated yet. cases spike areas they're going lockdown in, say, Vermont around 66% fully vaccinated 75% one dose. Can't believe often heard this. monumental level mental gymnastics. Almost impressive. Depends part country, though. VT, worries. MS, shitshow. data behind statement? 

Look demographic stats deaths covid across age groups. 

There hundreds deaths COVID vs vaccine. remember hearing last big holiday Texas lifting mask mandate. Didnt really amount much. 

We got get used fact life now, covids going anywhere going get it, probably multiple times, throughout rest lives. Mitigate can; wear mask want to, get vaccinated, time move on. Ah yes, masks effective blocking virus. /s

They‚Äôre stop transmission, reception COVID. wearing mask selfish. Thanks antivax fucks  you‚Äôre gonna delete ‚Äúgotta libs‚Äù? We're tracking asymptomatic mild breakthrough infections, we're concerned asymptomatic mild infections. Hospitalizations deaths metric we're using determine whether need take additional precautions, that's perfectly acceptable. 

Flipping restrictions like light switch every minor increase mild cases fly American public. Even result stopping asymptomatic spread, would ALSO much intense effect suppressing vaccine uptake hesitant. soon start proclaiming vaccinated people need take additional precautions, chance getting people board goes window. 

From risk/reward perspective worth effort stop effectively non-issue mild cold vaccinated person nearly circumstances. 

As Australia New Zealand, they're rough year. Unless get vaccination rate up, constant lockdowns going wear real thin (they already are). 

You pontificate day people ""should do,"" like give comfort freedoms indeterminate amount time protect people know can't see, make likely going happen. need focus people ACTUALLY do, start there. new cases younger crowd became eligible first dose vaccines around month ago, infections combined vaccinations giving antibodies age bracket quickly, also note adults only, 18+ assume, means overall immunity UK population probably around 70-75% instead, cusp overall herd immunity based experts saying Delta. really important part 50 old age group, around 97% testing positive antibodies, that's keep serious illness down. Looking vaccination rates, guaranteed lot people still die thing Texas. Well still declined still incredibly unlikely catch even less likely get symptoms all, there's that. Get vaxxed, wash hands often, eat well exercise.  Yes, disability dynamic too! really bad flare, use cane. Now, don‚Äôt. days brain fog worse others. Yeah imo belive difficult registration system led initial drop. simple system changed numbers dropped 80% I've monitoring since worked said every site LA experienced too. Yes localized 1 city, also second largest city US. 

From heard effectiveness virus lasts 6 months. least that's coworkers experiencing. that's also many fully vaccinated people saying too. Look understand anecdotal something bigger going here. authorized get booster shot future, please do. I've read delta variant effectiveness vaccine dropped 30%. Please stay safe. want lose anyone anyone lose dood Yes haven‚Äôt handled anything. isnt Vietnam here. Good luck work Vietnam propaganda? saying nonsense. population 80 percent vaccinated get back us. Right haven‚Äôt even started bragging game started. already wasted 18 months. started vaccinating last year. 9 months later vaccinated one. going sports stadiums , museums, bars restaurants traveling around world. Meanwhile locked down. hope sight,   education race political leanings though?

Edit - getting vaccinated part Yep.

It's important ever keep healthy fit possible.

It people's responsibility keep safe. America Yeah, article debunks commenters whole shit.  lmao took Unless talking kids, currently 32.9% US adults first shot yet! 

But suppose intend destroy country vaccinated, too, maybe makes back 40.  Tell there‚Äôs epidemic children 12 dying hospitalized relative risks. Misinformation. vaccine risk children virus - chance myocarditis lot higher kids catch virus. kids MCIS vaccine virus. deaths vaccine deaths virus. Well like said somewhere els, gonne only/one eu nations red. means want travel need quarantaine 10 days. nation even let us in. earth would travelling bigger priority basic human needs(social contact)?   Well family vaccinated up‚Ä¶ us‚Ä¶ sort is. Terrific news! I've heard moderna also causes symptoms people Pfizer, could anecdotal. seems incredibly unlikely.  cool! Awesome initiative then! 

I elected lead, read... Yeah really sucks. cardiologist thinks go away time, I‚Äôm trying patient. also got test results back appears heart doesn‚Äôt damage! I‚Äôm free get back exercise least. Hospital admissions increased much lesser extent before. parts UK well Ireland still seeing full effect Delta variant. Keeping level restrictions meant got hand Scotland, case England. group responsible transmission still fully vaccinated result breakthrough cases among vaccinated. Blablabla. fine. problem everything opened bit early. young people getting first vaccine shots already going infecting other. Luckily less likely get ill get hospitalized 77% want get vaccinated.  Also probably least 20 adults crowd manage kids, cook whatever godly things do. That‚Äôs least 14 many vaccinated. Yeah like once. Vietnam saw Americans dying combat every single night, upwards 50% daily news programming. point I‚Äôm making it‚Äôs seeing. 50% media coverage covid depth way, would never able escape it. media sugarcoating bad since day 1. Always perspective people don‚Äôt virus. cost lives. government took calculated risk. weighed social needs covid cases. Covid cases skyrocketting hospital numbers still declining (for now). future tell us risk wise. soft drinks culprit? Asking friend.... annoyed news anchor made statement ""We'll see many people flew post-pandemic skies 4th July weekend"" cardiologist said post covid patients heart issues fit young people athletes. Hard true So, easy easy enough let people die doors hospitals? taking smoking? getting prostate test? Driving wile sleepy? die without medical care? Everyone? mean like less ten 1% people? meant? Yeah symptoms consistent POTS. cardiologist doesn‚Äôt want test POTS thinks go away own, there‚Äôs real treatment taking beta blockers, I‚Äôm interested in. regimen increased sodium fluids improve symptoms. Healthcare professional, I've wearing mask non-stop (except 30 min meal break) 12 hours time, least 3 days per week year now. I'm getting ready fly east coast Hawaii wear mask 11 hours never really crossed mind. Spelling word 'shield' phonetic? Certainly, close 40% America's lost someone close. Maybe 10%? real county averaging high double digit low tripple digit numbers pre vaccination, post vaccination double digit day new cases month. Point vaccines fucking work fastest way return normalcy. Going around city really even know there's pandemic going on.

GET VACCINATED PEOPLE!!!  Hospitalizations lag substantially less deaths, hospitalizations undeniably rising slowly past waves.  calculating number above?

You took 308,112,728 June 12th subtracted 331,651,464 reported today divided difference (23,538,736) number days (25), correct?

I get 980k, I'm sure same, I'm guessing pulled 7/6 data since that's had, 7/7 data came me.

But important since still looking average number doses **reported** per day since Jun 12th. That's data telling us. telling us number doses administered since Jun 12th, telling us number reported.

If got shot Jun 5th, state tell CDC Jun 13th, I'm showing number calculating, chart show Jun 5th.

You tracking?  AHHHHHHHHHH Ruining things everyone?

How fucking dense even utter words? plenty fear porn lol. I‚Äôve seen body bags lied stadiums, people respirators hospitals. like think tho may botched process, future pandemic hopefully smoothe systematic process get control.
Maybe losses experienced pandemic save lives next one occurs. learned alot I‚Äôm sorry reinstate precautions. smart get appointments taken care of, especially gallbladder surgery (ouch)! I‚Äôm overall well-vaccinated state rather poorly vaccinated area I‚Äôm trying get appointments taken care well fall. Take care! People CAN'T get vaccine, sympathy.

People REFUSE get vaccine, none. doctors got Pfizer AZ also got infected delta variants.  Please keep mind. 

 
""It already known Sars-CoV-2 continue spread among partially-vaccinated individuals ‚Äì although risk much lower unvaccinated people ‚Äì recent weeks, new information appeared suggests Delta still capable transmitted doses. Doctors Clalit Health Services, Israel‚Äôs largest health care organization, found around half adults infected new outbreak Delta fully inoculated Pfizer vaccine. news prompted Israel re-impose indoor mask requirement reassess Covid-19 regulations. 
At time, study released team infectious diseases specialists University Cambridge found antibodies blood samples taken individuals received two doses AstraZeneca vaccine much less responsive Delta variant original strain Sars-Cov-2. thought explain virus continued spread among healthcare workers hospitals across India, even though fully vaccinated AstraZeneca jab. One report eastern state Odisha, reported 274 cases fully-vaccinated healthcare workers March 1 June 10."" feel like getting vaccine easier pretty much anything, whereas breaking food addiction isn‚Äôt. much less (actually zero) empathy it, plus harms people including hospital staff higher risk getting sick result. Soooo don‚Äôt know, think maybe there‚Äôs line, it. typical American response. ""it's care""

Wanna travel anywhere outside country? Still get covid test. pandemic still happening good idea means üôè  Yeah there‚Äôs nothing them. group people won‚Äôt stop rest country living lives normal. antibody tests specifically detect natural infections look non-spike antibodies. Hopefully whoever requesting test clarifies one need. Yeah, live people don‚Äôt really go doctor they‚Äôre sick. Think old grumpy farmer men think it‚Äôs waste time lol. It‚Äôs regardless vaccination status. wow ok sporting events full capacity? 

step inside school. still happening That‚Äôs rather callous, given thousands people want get vaccinated, can‚Äôt due medical history existing medical condition life certainly never ever again. Sure I'm getting back activities used enjoy pre-covid, people I'll never look way spent 2020 ignoring rules, partying posting social media. Conversely, know in-laws still hold grudge wife choosing stay home keep family safe last year. nightclub receive fine legal. People need either vaccinated negative fast test enter nightclubs, dont guarantee people covid. Fortunately necessarily issue allmost adults already vaccinated netherlands.

Basically opening nightclubs ""Testing Acces"" taking calculated risk. yeah definitely move onto next excuse haha.. it'll convince least well we'll know 2 weeks. wish breakdown based age, see who's getting infected &amp; hospitalized. tried make NCAA football happen US army's games West Point. COVID consultant site. audience tested regularly army, compound stadium public access, unlimited resources.

We 2 successful games know fucked everything up? teams give shit, took 1. 

Japan interest hiring people experience like Olympics, government thinks handle alone, burying heads dirt entire year. large group nurses protest earlier year olympics obvious what's happen. need place travel sanctions immediately, allow olympians return they've properly isolated cleared. They're really fuck us over. lol even vaccinated? still face restrictions unvaccinated travelling. there's virus going around kill mean happening people?? vaxx widely available anyone wants get it.

There still large portions population eligible. understand sentiment, sentence entirely false. 

Aside cannot (and mean legitimately cannot) get vaccine, millions children 12 wholly ineligible. Then, there‚Äôs Delta variant affects children greater degree success causing breakthrough cases vaccinated. 

Point being, haven‚Äôt able attain herd immunity (and won‚Äôt likely ever) it‚Äôs important still follow protocols, especially public areas children. I'm also NY (no party affiliation) vaccinated live upstate. changed almost nothing. Places open illegally whole entire time restraunts,bars,gyms, partys etc. worked entire time march 2020 ( im finish contractor paint/drywall etc) single customer asked crew wear mask once. wear masks around us protect kids us. live NEPA border PA even open business. attended dirtbike race sept 2020 500 attendees single covid precaution site. Christ attended race Virginia year 1200 people attend single covid precaution site. Besided reddit everyday interactions tell people considered long long time. county 18 active cases 0% tested positive yesterday .03% positive 7 day avg safe say regardless vaccination status political affiliation us, id love see try convince otherwise ill add county 58% fully vaccinated age groups   California conservatives fanatics‚Ä¶. several relatives. Lively discussions quarter given. 48% Americans fully vaccinated well. full lockdown unlikely, vaccinated people reluctant accept it. discussed add restrictions unvaccinated people, limit risk contagion promote vaccination. example require vaccine recent test (which would longer free...) activities. Pretty close vaccination rate care yourself

This true. got vaccinated protect around me. don‚Äôt wear masks anymore fully vaccinated care themselves, too? I‚Äôm sorry, simply disagree notion public policy based around low risk danger. Kids die car crashes drown, aren‚Äôt closing pools shutting roads. Personal responsibility risk assessment real thing ‚Äúeveryone else‚Äôs problems mine‚Äù attitude that‚Äôs stemmed pandemic obnoxious IMO hopeful may make bigger difference despite possible small overall percentage increase. given current situation even percentage points make huge difference. course full authorization means there's weight make mandatory. Sounds like county NC. think last 7 years proven 3 10 Americans dumb shit. governments gently break bad news people. ""To me, pandemic over, I'm vaccinated"" navel gazing, dare say, American position take.

It's wording issue. doubt people taking survey knew definition pandemic means disease spreading across several continents. definition, yes, pandemic still ongoing. people 1st world countries, they've seen months loosened restrictions, drastic reduction cases/deaths many cases already going friends/family living life like pre-covid. sense, pandemic ""situation"" essentially them. positive news, sure. 

I think, general, Americans follow government certain point (contrasted cultures traditionally place absolute trust government), lot folks go ahead consider ""government hint"" green light go ahead consider pandemic over. 

Just opinion. PA averaging like 1.3 cases per 100k now, also averaging 165ish cases per day, like 1% positivity rate. 

Idk standards articles use determine ‚Äúhotspots‚Äù PA ain‚Äôt hotspot lol Sure, vaccinated ass isn‚Äôt problem. Foreign spectators banned months ago. one's travel plans disrupted. 30% probably ones called hoax  serious? Numerous studies shown ventilators rarely change outcome. Anti-viral meds Convalescent plasma obviously better treatments. Yes, 700% absolute mostest.  mine Friday evening, Netherlands unlimited sick pay right even weekday I‚Äôd good. 

More worried weekend. yea, fully vaccinated!   What's point information give you, disregard fake misleading. Bringing analogies compare science ridiculous itself, admit ""my information internet better institute professionals is"". Covid completely going away anytime soon. number people hesitant get vaccine along variants passed along easier. shut downs created slow spread uncontrollable otherwise. 

The vaccine adds massive control, lowering number cases little little time, drastically decreasing deaths serious infection requires hospitalization. 

Look United States higher average vaccination rate pretty much opened 100%. seeing delta variant making impact even vaccinated, serious cases deaths non vaccinated, even deaths hospitalizations improved drastically vaccine rolled out. 

I agree fully opening regionally decided based vaccination rates availability, may increases infections areas open up. going hardly interacting going crowded places again. People get sick, it‚Äôs important don‚Äôt crowd hospitals though Doubt. Because, naturally people getting back social gatherings, vaccinated not, lead positive tests. many hospitalized worse? seeing positives less less hospitalizations vax working serious risk worry about. gon feel like shit. Hope take day work!

I've heard crazy stories sure like villagers worshipping 'corona' goddess also true? specifically covid ? consider called 'piss' 'shit' bath kind ritual? sure source reliable? hear you. tend vote Democratic abstain (never federal level, there's Green Democrat docket), considerable antipathy toward Republican party. used Republican, 2008, threw hands them.

I like either party neither matches values, Ds closer, least they'll listen science often. many people france fully vaccinated now? Nvm less 50%.

This church actually least 2 campuses within Harris County memory serves correctly(used live side city). main office church 1 mile Galveston County Harris County imagine that's Galveston handling data regarding outbreak. downvoted? legitimate question.   may right that's they're telling themselves, rationally folks would admit case COVID would likely keep far longer. 

I can't help feel like lot people making excuses fact really wanted first place would find way.  better treatments? Absolutely right. Japan cancels, pay steep penalty. IOC cancel. IOC cancels, forfeit sponsorship money. much money lost. way hell going cancel willingly. way, overwhelming majority Japan want cancel Olympics. ""had relatives"". know mean. point I'm making 0-10 days exactly long time period. think conflating analysis 60+ days statistic 0-10.

I'm certain point trying make. look 0-10 time period initial test results, that's time person going continue active infection. Day 0 day test. someone goes 10 days following test without showing symptoms, means asymptomatic case. 10 days individual almost certainly recovery disease, weeks months follow ""Long Covid"" symptoms show up, check 61 days. One set symptoms active infection, another set virus run course. Where's confusion here, what's issue drew conclusion paper linked meant significant portion asymptomatic cases result long covid.

Once again, backwards. study linked exclusively looked Long Covid sufferers found 32% symptoms period initial infection. made claims percentage asymptomatic cases turn Long Covid except say greater zero. understand importance distinction, continuing debate. jobs give sick days. day miss day paid, everyone afford that. think 3 10 don‚Äôt give fuck.   Give stat suggest categorically epidemic 12 folks relative risks (like driving passenger car)

Spoiler: can‚Äôt it‚Äôs rooted science, facts anything fear peddling. original virus 70% population needed get vaccinated, 65% adults (first shot) around 59% total population.

With Delta variant (R0 6) need closer 85% vaccination rates actually fake vaccines Please tell exactly wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúhigh quality‚Äù post feel I‚Äôm going change opinion. I‚Äôm saying shouldn‚Äôt get medical care, ventilator, there‚Äôs shortage. Ventilators shown much help anyway. There‚Äôs much better treatments. Yeah antivaxxing I'm gonna risk new variants biggest concern Seattle travelers.

A lot people travel area countries vaccination rates. say nothing tourists.

Things definitely looking up, get wrong, still think it'd good us kind keep heads weeks least. 628,000 Americans shut permanently Yes, it‚Äôs pretty clear failure. 40 hour limit low enforcement QR code‚Äôs means rule pretty much useless avoid infections venues. 

I read people went clubs without showing anything door man. looks exactly me. History(?) repeating . 30% disapointed advocating for, specifically, death. 

Did feel way flu vaccine Covid? flu dangerous well, taken lot seriously. 

Do feel people smoke tobacco drink alcohol allowed medical treatment get sick? increasing chances death, well others. die it?

Do feel people wear bug spray turned away catch West Nile virus Malaria? know... promoting death death others preventing it.

Do understand ignorant comment is? is, quite literally, single situation type hateful bullshit could applicable toward? 

Look, people US allowed stupid (clearly). allowed *not* things. realized, exactly country known solidarity citizens anymore. People going different views, that's fine. I'm telling you, hate speech like bit let open going push people apart. Spend much energy educating ostracizing see make change, rather trying cancel people out. ‚úåÔ∏è Georgia 50 COVID deaths last week...

(Or honestly patient plain ""gross"")

I think people also take sick days much least hope do, past many coworkers still show work sick ""it's cold"" go take care elderly person running low grade fever minor cough, etc.

While think life headed back towards normal, think new normal. definatly tell I'm getting plane sitting next someone coughing back day would think ""well sucks hope dont catch that.""

I also continue using hand sanitizer get back car coming shopping. 

I always kept basement pretty well stocked non perishables extra water emergencies dont feel like going store, craziness early pandemic shelves barren changed this, purchased chest freezer prep extra meals real, healthy, homemade food incase something crazy ever happens again. still rotate eat prepped food big deal, ""normal"" before. whole incident changed things life permanently, good opinion reasonable changes.

/s hill pride weekend full 2019 crowd levels. kind freaking I'm like ""I guess us vaccinated fine???"". Felt kinda good time. close friends hit cheerfully told got full vaxxed. Quite left field considering personalities expect tin foil hat vaccine roll out. are, totally unwilling get simply felt like rushed. talk despite Covid FAR worse vaccine side effect. get it.  want protect yourself, ditch surgical mask get ffp3/N95 respirators instead. 

Surgical masks designed protect around you, respirators designed protect wearer.

Last time said got lot experts telling wrong, easily check yourself, here's pdf 3M. 60+ numbers seem super low, idea why? Clearly they've already vaccinated bunch 18-59's surely longer problem enough vaccine supplies?

I know exact numbers I'm pretty sure UK something like 95% 60's vaccinated 90%+ fully vaccinated. know Christian Scientists gotten vaccinated, FWIW. need get vaccinated tested go bar without fixed seating example.

We saw well worked. 600 party people led 190 infections reported far.   could see medical facilities requiring masks going forward. actually makes lot sense settings. pandemic voluntary now.  don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs extremely likely, don‚Äôt know odds. isn‚Äôt quite like though. Presymptomatic asymptomatic could viral load, it‚Äôs former increases latter stays same. It‚Äôs presymptomatic likely higher viral load.  roughly 160 people infected, six (about 3.7%) vaccinated, said Dr. Philip Keiser, Galveston County local health authority.

‚ÄòNough said Come much deadly ""variant"" is...a days ago report came UK proving 2 months Delta dominant strain , major increase across board. Data comes yet somehow never talked about. 

Coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/healthcare I'm Canada vaccination centers well! Working pretty well. dad works restaurant two employees come covid last week. began feel ill, go tested. Almost four days later, mom developed symptoms got positive test morning. live highly unvaccinated area country.  know statistic citing (32% asymptomatic) symptoms 0-10 days post-covid, right?

There's bit unpack here. First off, 0-10 days 'post covid', 0-10 days first positive test, read paper. Someone symptoms primary infection period DEFINES asymptomatic cases, **of course** understand statistic. even bringing see medical records self-reported symptoms different self-reported symptoms - clarify? 

It's fact they've gone back prior year's medical history, found people matching symptoms existed pre-covid, removed pool analyzed. way, lifetime allergy sufferer getting counted long covid.

As far tell, study relying that. it, lifetime allergy sufferer counted amongst number reporting symptoms without ever covid. Accepting people match profile going skew data way that's going make 'symptomatic never infected' pool larger needs be.

I'm saying insistence control group bad thing, right want one. I'm saying study picked significant *other issues* make question methodology used got accurate result. fact is, studies flaws. They're different flaws. America's largest problem always third country empathy. None whatsoever. Sorry bearer bad news...TL;DR definitely spread it.

I guess say evidence wrong?  admit basing decision feelings rather evidence. completely irrational. want make informed decision; want people baby you. Testing wasn‚Äôt widespread don‚Äôt know Covid. January 2020. thing is, can‚Äôt get +90% vaccine uptake, they‚Äôre back square one natural immunity, suck big time. virus becoming contagious allow amber green countries, someone end bringing virus causing outbreak one point.

Life short live isolated. humans Earth, it‚Äôs ours. Many us want explore world, see different cultures meet new people. would concerned living New Zealand. green countries probably handful developed high income countries huge vaccine uptake, would never able see rest world?

That aside, need make sure population fully immune virus. Europeans traveled America wiped whole continent centuries ago since Natives Americans weren‚Äôt immune smallpox. Covid becomes like cold rest world New Zealand still highly susceptible fully immune, pandemic actually begin then. Instead debating this, really plan vaccinate everyone open up. need vaccinate everyone. mean 600k people dead US that‚Äôs lot morons probably. I'm UK. say NEVER.. certainly feel like properly ""normal"" i.e. like pre-covid maybe 5 years now.

Not based hard facts, personal gut feeling expectation. kids vaccinated, rest achieve herd immunity old fashioned way care. hope produce escape variant disease infested bodies. Oh right... bad assumed PCR tests easily accessible everywhere. guess countries don‚Äôt much testing capacity per capita sg. Oke check, exemple need quarantaine 10 days france netherland fucked up. go car that? border checks endangering people.

If part problem. Article seems fall trap guy replying to, drawing conclusions developing data. Hospitalizations deaths lag cases, we've known start.

Third, demographics play huge role too, know younger people much less likely suffer serious issues.
