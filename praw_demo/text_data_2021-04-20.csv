We also one state half total population least one shot (NH) another 5 states 48%+ (CT, ME, MA, VT, NM). Yes! Astra manufactured Argentina sent Mexico complete process. lot $67 hasn‚Äôt one worlds largest economies built domestic vaccine production?

Because can't overnight. Canada drew plans make covid vaccines domestically last summer may start rolling vaccines fall. Well, that's wrong Yep..

Unfortunately, people confirmed pre-pandemic (judgry) opinion. let kids choose college lol difference, go ahead fully approve vaccines? elaborate, stopped stop lights cars front me, nowhere go. could wrong, believe seeing incoming collision cause tense contact, actually make injuries worse. elaborate, stopped stop lights cars front me, nowhere go. could wrong, believe seeing incoming collision cause tense contact, actually make injuries worse. Covid treatable. Please educate many deaths occurred area past 5 years? know they're already using Pfizer Hong Kong they'll probably start using mainland soon. Distinction without difference.  ""We're afraid legalizing cannabis may lead uncontrollable consumption.""

""Of drugs?""

""No, doughnuts."" sooner everyone gets vaccinated sooner shit opened back masks go away

yeah CDC needs explicit rather ""the worst yet come"" bullshit. messaging far entirely hunker down, mask up, keep social distancing even vaccinated, zero indication endgame. 

It's fine waiting certain threshold vaccinated (or appropriately, certain threshold vaccinations *available* want imo), messaging needs much clear. is. already pretty hard average Indian get visa US. need prove try stay situation clear won't. get work visa sponsored recently become really hard impossible. Whops, mean Doug Ford. can't believe one smoke crack. really ban export vaccines countries blanket ban (de jure de facto) export them.

I'm fine exporting vaccines, even production issues cause deliveries EU cut (as long deliveries cut equal percentage everywhere) recipient country allows exports production capacity themselves. vaccine doesn‚Äôt stop getting transmitting virus


It stop getting infected transmitting.  say otherwise dishonest. Put drive-through vaccinations every fast food drive-through. Put nurses front grocery stores ready give shots enter hand 20% coupons (ID req'd prevent idiots getting 20 shots, course). get rid appointments, put vaccines people rather making people come vaccines, bet get another ~20% population. studies say statistically significant, marginal. exactly strong data. People wearing TX mandate, tho. see gender mentioned? ‚ÄúMost adults vaccinated‚Äù

Currently 26% Americans 16+ fully vaccinated according free healthcare though!!!! great 40+ use remaining AZ vaccine though, 40+ getting Pfizer/moderna yet reasoning. Itll nice choice necessity course lol. I'm confident personally resources figure next Patient Zero is, everyone's suspect far I'm concerned - far, mean, silly mask, I'm hardly scrubbing skin bloody something patiently waiting day I'll longer wear mask indoors, period. I'm obedience, choice. Rob? Argentina sent batch locally-produced Sputnik Russia homologated. works out, start production locally. 


Edit: testing less higher positive rate. really walking around expecting patient zero? absolutely watching mirrors though... going high fructose corn syrup unhealthy foods isn‚Äôt enough, like reduction smoking wasn‚Äôt coming hard tobacco companies. 

Doctors, public health officials, others telling people years quit smoking - happens equivalently tell people quit fat? That‚Äôs ‚Äúfat shaming‚Äù. Smokers exiled buildings little bus-station huts 100 feet doors, smoke outside rain cold. equivalent making obese people get told eat outside?

Obviously extreme examples, point LOT reduction smoking making smoking much socially unacceptable was, putting pressure smokers *themselves* quit (or start). pressure put obese people make change. YIKES.   call ""ploy""? one trying deceive anyone. plainly marketed incentivization. Like. That's whole point. fairness, says ""safe"", means get food-borne illness (assuming stored properly). Beef, pork, lamb know very, small risk food-borne illness long exterior cooked. 

As long FDA requiring restaurants cook meat safe temperatures, whatever. Admittedly would nice added nuance safe vs. effectively safe healthy people. least would stop kids served rubber 16 years parents always cook FDA guidelines. check too. thank you. really traumatized years getting trip NYC. Even prefer camp rather stay motels. Awful experience! technically wrong, direction! 94, 90! Good know! Dude, get excited free soda. I'll never get tired free shit, matter lol true knows things work out. call success yet given ""Researchers Texas A&amp;M University week reported new strain coronavirus called BV-1."" Time tell New Zealand ""beaten"" covid multiple times. described true little social cohesion buy-in many countries have. establish benefits? system consistently determine vaccinated, can't grant special privileges been. got reported false, wanted clarify -- actually supported data! actual clinical trials test this, studies Israeli rollout, Pfizer vaccine found result 94% decrease asymptomatic infections! See: ever industry could benefit vaccine passports, cruise industry. understanding (and may completely wrong) stronger response vaccine, stronger immune system, would opposite theory. also get lovely experience people coming see complaining masks hard work around can‚Äôt breathe they‚Äôre going keep chin fifteenth time you‚Äôve told pull back up? Bonus points ones come front door knowing damn well tested positive two days earlier.

I hate people whole lot time last year. would know color are? know color trolls even modest vaccination target dropping restrictions would least motivation people.

This I've thinking long time. ""When state hits 70% vaccination restrictions dropped"" something appropriate state question. lost war even started glad finally drop mandates, personally ima keep wearing mask indoors. extreme weather events indication, pandemics scale longer ""once lifetime"" occurences factors pushed zoonotic jump still full swing. 

Plus nasty folks walking around horrendous BO public health disaster. Wash ya ass, people declawing cats haha Huh?  Stupid brain here, too. husband got days. second, chills fatigue went bed early. stayed extra late, waiting side effects never happened. course totally exhausted next day. bad knee hurt days later, rainy happens. I'm thinking really sore arm. Congrats getting vaccine! Everyone know ages either planning to, big hurry, among educated population. WFH, low risk, pain get appointment wait. Outreach minority groups entirely different problem, least city pouring resources that. Shocking see Alabama last nationally ranking üôÑ takes year build type factories. money thrown. Canada literally capacity all. truly disappointed get sticker, I, like Homer Simpson genuinely enjoy free donut. I‚Äôd take donut J day. said, grateful. vaccine doesn‚Äôt stop getting transmitting virus, what‚Äôs point healthy/fit 15-45 year get it?

It though.  Friday honestly 7 days extremely (90-95 percent) protected.  actually believe vaccines work? Even though concrete, incontrovertible evidence do?

Less 6000 americans gotten covid since getting vaccinated. 6000 84 MILLION vaccinated. That's massive reduction cases.

No one ever thought would prevent 100 percent cases unless know vaccines work. work decrease amount cases deaths, strain hospitals. Covid going away, vaccines proven actual real world data bring manageable levels.

Sunday felt 80% better. still feel little drained today experience definitely better lot I‚Äôve read places. can't get herd immunity via vaccination seems like we'll get naturally. Unless herd immunity also defined ""covid going extinct.""

Oh look Cuba think really want Freedom right now. Students get vaccinated campus. know lot people feeling anxiety like me, know lot people like struggling deep resentment towards lax dismissive pandemic. magical cure either things you, know wife children also much you, country, world would:

* (Practically) lock family away house year more.
* Wear mask go makes wretch feel like I'm suffocating.
* Join COVID vaccine study get treated like pin-cushion science.
* Sacrifice relationships family friends begged responsible feel grief ridiculed, rebuffed, dismissed.
* Spent many hundreds hours educating best educate around virus, vaccines, safe behavior.
* Gave thousands charity feed strangers fell food insecurity, house homeless, get jobs laid off.

However, fills full hope **so many done things much more!** **heroes** me, **friends deep meaningful way** even though we'll probably never meet. We've bled together common cause want know fill full hope inspiration. could hand medals awards would get them, meantime sincere prayers promise I'll keep trying help small way.   2000 deaths per day single cause still higher matter population. 2000 number. might father, mother, friend, sibling on.

Right shot felt really warm lightheaded could anxiety getting waiting 15 see gonna bad reaction. super mild headache rest day fine next. notice weird burning sensations again, severe anxiety that's exactly new. Also arm pain like get flu shot every year. 

Hopefully 2nd shot mild lol atleast I'll know normal feel like ass fine couple days. unknowns worried, still getting regardless though. hope outright remove fucking thing.

Shall update. yea mean, jan 20th obviously wasnt lofty, important contexts sake mention biden made promise month earlier people definitely skeptical time Google search term literally ""cannabis covid complications"" test follow up, we? think /u/revets saying Jan 20 wasn‚Äôt loafty. Hmm, bad breath, don‚Äôt like wear mask... Cruise ships huge waste fuel. climate emergency alone reason stop unneccessary travel, nevermind weird diseases.

Correct. approved Moderna Astrazeneca despite months since filed. We're also sitting millions vaccines. Yesterday ~3000 elderly vaccinated whole country vaccine approvals promoting ""indigenous"" vaccines. 

Which rejected? Aight guys lets get real, many cases worldwide really think been? India alone wouldnt surprised 300-400M+ people already got covid, know fact 2M 'estimated cases' Mexico LEAST 20-25x higher real terms. 

Over billion exageration would it? 1100 cases today. Hopefully curfew gets pushed back later 9:30pm like while... gonna say number infections decreasing compared rest country due us curfew, apparently it‚Äôs hurting. Pretty lame living life, though! recent discovery way diagnose treat rare blood clots, risk vaccination reduced. people know India said everyone stopped careful couple months ago.

Suggest Correction Noooooo, reallllllllyyyy ?? everyone does, shrill debate outdoor masking tiresome. It‚Äôs indoors outdoors, it‚Äôs masking courtesy close proximity someone else.

Waiting outdoor queue, barbecue, seated next someone baseball game? Wear mask, time proximity could outweigh protective factors ventilation UV light.

Passing someone briefly sidewalk? It‚Äôs probably big deal, maybe hold mask face temporarily courtesy, give 6 feet berth possible?

Walking empty block nobody around? need mask whatsoever. US entirely different culture. think lot office buildings Silicon Valley going remain vacant year... It‚Äôs undercounted. Correct title *New, antibody-resistant coronavirus variant discovered Texas* Lol done developing countries. Really feels like hard part over. We‚Äôre end stages. news articles read that? would like hear whole town lined punch dick. Canada received 13 million doses now.

Baffling Japan handled far. basically it. volunteered clinic ‚Äúscribe‚Äù vaccination cards.

Holy shit, really say vaccines cause herpes. read article meant shingles, means people previously chicken pox... could prevented another vaccine. 2000 deaths population billion nothing. 2000 die 365 days year still less 0,1% population. So, since we're making stupid reductionist comparisons, uk then?

Or germany, develop shots anyone? Ugh great damn song head, thanks evidence this? US *has* exporting raw ingredients: fact, nearly every worldwide dose Pfizer vaccine begins raw materials produced US soil.

Don‚Äôt confuse short supply due massive domestic demand export ban... Sam Adams already tried free alcohol one budged. budweiser think... people scared lot last year stopped caring year unfortunately. Aussie here......we similar boat. AstraZeneca recommended 50's now.

I'm rural India last year covid barely made dent rural parts. mostly urban phenomenon. year tho.. disgusting, selfish, pro-covid could probably travel UK/EU Europe general. Probably Canada aswell. depends though. May? bit early maybe, we're looking something like 40-50% vaccinated end may EU think. July sometimes? Probably closer 70% adults vaccinated. quick math though take grain salt.

Given vaccinated, + summer last year led far fewer cases + somewhere around 70% EU vaccinated probably bit UK would feel pretty safe traveling atleast. submission linking independent.co.uk automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

EVERYTHING POLITICAL 

Especially called ""apolitical."" suspicious news, state retirement accounts projected black. Yeah

I double take that's serious overkill current vaccination rate even cynical experts saying we'll largely back normal fall. 

I hope moonshot cover asses plan cut early vaccination shows real effect. supplemental healthcare care covers 80-90% prescriptions costs, covers eye glasses, pyhsio, massage, chiropractors, 500 whatever health costs etc etc.  So. Maybe. health insurance covers things to. 


It‚Äôs thing though.  

How much pay healthcare taxes dependent income snd many people family.  family four make 40000 per year aren‚Äôt paying 6000 taxes healthcare.

If want non-merge surgery fast us system going better.  rare conditions us going better population means Probally cases specialized dr treat it.  that‚Äôs case Canada health pays visits understand. 


But matter happens many times go ther dr (me kids adhd meds doses dialed month) , costs us nothing time go.

Explains UK got bad tbf. still wear mask too. Definitely helped bunch flu, that's sure! FL people seem wearing masks much large crowds though. question actually popped head recently. 

Covid-19 vaccines continually developed. 

How Phase 2/3 trials pandemic highly suppressed already existing vaccines? new variants keep popping could overwhelm current vaccines immunity pace vaccinations doesn‚Äôt pick around world.

Btw AIDS pandemic still here. Totally agree.

In early March, **before** production US plant ruined, Leiden plant facing production problems, J&amp;J asked US ship doses EU make shortfall here, request ultimately denied. Since then, \~11 000 000 J&amp;J doses shipped Leiden US, exports way blocked.

This big scandal EU's part, especially since Leiden plant producing since February, first batches delivered April. believe protectionism, point put interests first. It‚Äôs crawling rancid personalities saying things like ‚ÄúI think don‚Äôt *want* over‚Äù working non stop since pandemic started. Glad deal 1st world problem. right man, lets stay locked masked 2023, together/s question is, could corona spike DNA entering cell nucleus causes problems blood clots?

Source : Plotkin SA, Orenstein WA, Offit PA. Plotkin's vaccines. 7th ed. ed. Philadelphia, PA: Elsevier; 2018. cities states strictest rules also highest vaccination rates. states lowest vaccination rates, like Mississippi longer mask mandate businesses fully open.

You mention Chicago, demand vaccine rest state people still fighting get vaccine. 3rd wave? Michigan entered chat...

Only matter time spread states unless people get vaccinated quickly. I‚Äôm confused. risk blood clots young people significantly lower J&amp;J AZ? anyone point data? Yes. China whatever want disregard individuals. Good news NL, rest EU get soon. Don‚Äôt despair. 2% Canadians fully vaccinated, lowest rate G20 mask mandate expired 2 3 weeks ago. single thing different. rural parts state nobody wears mask, suburbs people mostly do. true mandate still true afterwards. Every chain store still signs need wear them. TIL. Oh thank goodness. India needs good news! AZ supply going expire soon, that‚Äôs reason age bracket lowered, even NACI recommendation stays 55+ vaccine Arguably India needs doses much right USA does. end global pandemic, nobody benefits rampant spread India. 1.3 billion inhabitants run ""golden opportunity"" virus mutate, something might come back bite us West.

The question also much act helps US vs much affects India rest world negatively. may create arbitrary shortages certain materials, leading heavy detriments Indian capacity marginally helping US (depending limits US Like everyone else raging epidemic hoarding

Other major producers like EU China exporting plenty. India exported lot recently situation got much worse. UK may exporting vaccines, exporting plenty raw materials.

You could argue US right decision limiting exports heavily affected pandemic, fact USA restrictive major powers comes vaccine exports. Half world uses , thousands separator rest uses .

It‚Äôs endemic, it‚Äôs never going away, always chance variant emerges somewhere. Better get used it. way visualize Covid vaccine supply demand per state/county? 

I hear lots anecdotes supply big one area demand big others. Would love see via data. 

I tried vaccine spotter shows ‚Äúrecently‚Äù can‚Äôt tell trend holding hours/days right now. issue insurance. Even though government said restrictions lifted 21st June festivals invest lot money front. government shown hesitation change rules little common sense notice.

Well yes, people die doesn‚Äôt happen soon. 

It‚Äôs happening already US hoarding AZ vaccine won‚Äôt use, come back Biden deliberately withholding supplies sabotaging supply chain selfishly before. 

He doesn‚Äôt seem like kind president. see. Important note second infections 99.99% mild covid. overwhelmingly severe covid cases. Maybe go study English Actually, lot support quite lot measures, compliance 70-90% measures except visitor rule 40%). probably good accepting rules, following them. also see lot, people think somehow excluded rules ""one time"" (sort count others mentality).

We society can't take responsibility sadly. mostly lot measures full ICU's society, difficulty behaving according believes follow measures agree personal level. Certainly failure society. yes, people complete lack personal responsibility country. 

Also, limiting amount COVID patients ICU cruel. Healthcare meant take care people want receive care. right have, expect capacity needed. third world country cannot take care citizens health needs (if that's rooting for, I'd guess would love live country almost healthcare facilities). want take away right people survive restrict treated, basically let people die. much taking away personal freedoms temporarily. kind country live in, luckily never ever will. play music loud?

Here's link again: Great, good US importer/partner vaccine Ocugen (OCGN) r/ocugen based Pennsylvania.

You find news press release waiting data apply FDA Emergency Use Authorization. They've said want import 100m doses year produce domestically US next year. 

This vaccine kept standard refrigerator 2 years room temperature 2 months! 

This classic old school way making vaccine give piece dead virus. Unless they're hiding dead bodies infections remained relatively low. WHOA old school way making vaccines? 
Can anyone tell side effects may compare likes using mRNA Adeno virus vector? Again, Biden administration incompetence. ""Masks work virus desperately need protect health care workers virus?"" That's prime Trumpism doublespeak right there. really annoys people continue advocating AZ saying stuff like ""it's still safer catching covid"" ""you chance dying car etc""

That's assuming binary choice AZ vaccine catching covid, works all. Catching covid, especially UK right now, overwhelming unlikely chances dying young even less so. even wasn't, moot alternative superior vaccines exist.

I'm also quite angry hard doctors pushing people UK get it. received another call today doctor saying appointment get vaccinated available acted shocked told would prefer wait Pfizer Moderna instead getting AZ vaccine. always try guilt trip accepting them, dismissing concerns excuses like ""you'll back queue"". Fair enough. I'd rather wait weeks/months take something proven serious risks death, MRNA vaccines don't. people obviously rejecting vaccine number I'm late 30s (officially, 45+ get jab here) they're going list, desperately trying use existing supplies. 

The UK effectively bullied getting on. people want roll dice it, best luck. I'm willing take chances waiting getting something better. no, apologise it. Michigan hit pretty hard first wave. know handled ""well"" people ones push back longer restrictions. keep meekly accepting them, they‚Äôll never end. Eh - old people understand, think also seeing letting run like wildfire contagious age group also problematic due mutation risk negating vaccination efforts...

At point shots arms important mind. Wrong. one study showed almost efficacy SA variant AZ mild/moderate symptoms (no data severe). Totally makes sense US wants look population first. world leader please publicly ask timeline export? answer always ""soon"". classic old school way using whole dead virus make vaccine like polio. Supposed near side effects. They'll run problem prevented SARS vaccines making Phase 2/3 trials back 2003 - insufficient disease circulating population. There's huge amount randomness states super spread incidents when. newsworthy best vaccine, newsworthy another vaccine going public.   Take upvote. left got come back lol mean, individual country doing. course does. letting businessmen set health policy?  Wrong. plenty data, UK, Germany, Denmark, Norway shows AZ vaccine small (\~1/100K) chance inducing rare clotting disorder. Similar results found JnJ US. vaccines paused assess risks, whereas mRNA vaccines not. Bharat Biotech already FDA certified lab made several US vaccines. US partner Ocugen Pennsylvania. BB committed manufacturing 700m doses year! Ocugen looking import 100m end year make 200m next year domestically. Feel way US one! guess there's data seen support that. would consider death severe. 100% good? It‚Äôs certainly better catching covid without sort protection, hope that. Meanwhile two new strains wreaking havoc throughout country. Less 10% vaccinated sadly. Hope situation improves soon. landing head. I've seen lots stories people getting knocked die brain injuries head hitting concrete...although suppose tornado good chance landing field. Well maybe good...but chance. I'm Philadelphia, work suburbs, people know drive Lancaster somewhere like get dose.  similar Chinese vaccine _Sinovac_ vaccine VLA2001 phase III trial made Valneva. vaccines use dead whole SARS-CoV-2 viruses.

It nothing J&amp;J AZ vaccines, use live (but non-replicating) _adenoviruses_, entirely different virus family, genetically modified genomes produce SARS-CoV-2 proteins instead copies adenovirus. Maybe - hope so. Kentucky governor stated get 2.5 million people least 1 dose, restrictions lifted we're sitting vaccine appointments can't get put arms. that's long con!

There‚Äôs evidence night curfews anything first four years experiment, published Journal Wine Economics, showed typical judge‚Äôs scores varied plus minus four points three blind tastings. wine deemed good 90 would rated acceptable 86 judge minutes later excellent 94.

Plus minus 4 points seems reasonable me. It‚Äôs like judges loved wine one minute totally hated got second glass.

The scores within small range rather exactly reproducible, probably it‚Äôs difficult thing do, pin wine exact number 0-100 based taste. genuine question, scientists keep saying last year virus mutates really slowly? slow?a new variant concern every week? got wrong actually mutates fast constantly we'll living forever trying outdo vaccines? anyone know expected endgame is? hope corona disappear entirely enough vaccinations yearly shots needed deal mutations? everybody vulnerable? would say something like 4-5x number actually reported cases. numerous studies estimating this, early much higher much 15-20x. possible early spread area far unreported cases gradually declines spread slows testing awareness.

Probably getting downvoted bots now. healthcare system collapsed lack masks, we'd fucked. Toddler mentality. already Ah. Makes much sense. take pride getting wounds healed best doctors world born wealth lmao

The next stimulus check (if ever get it) 100% tied vaccination proof. Create Uncle Sam posters promote &amp; ads.

There way this. politicians messaging dumb AF. cite me? found things saying around 40%. reports there. German health minister said Curevac. Trump got lot people killed. Fair, I'm hoping restriction Janssen, least something like 40+. 
 
That would massively speed vaccinations, provided able deliver sufficient volumes. take account J&amp;J shot, due single-shot, way benefits AstraZeneca vaccine, especially slow deliveries are. since AZ shot already given people +60 doses cover that, would make sense give J&amp;J +60 too. There's enough 60 people worst people still taking seriously. live Mumbai one worst hit cities country, still see people rooming around roads morning exercise, sitting public gardens happening even state government imposed curfew. 100% seems asked anyone would rather die you‚Äôre 20 70, basically everyone would say 70. apply people well? brother dying tragic great grandfather dying.

There less-than-perfectly-rational line thinking says virus gather mutations allow evade vaccine induced immunity (like Flu viruses do). people shouting loudest ignoring T-cell immunity, focusing entirely antibodies. Turns T-cell immunity important antibodies, great. 

 SARS-CoV-2 generate mutations nearly rate flu viruses. Willfully ignorant history. Lol hate weed Exactly. gave 18 negative votes. ""Don't change behaviour vaccinated!""

""huh, strange. people willing get vaccinated?"" like one develop condition year wearing mask? lot less likely get outdoors indoors. Less 10% covid cases contracted outdoors.

That's states outdoor mask mandates mandate unable stay 6 feet away others. seems reasonable. Macron urged EU countries send 5% vaccine supplies developing countries help bloc regain initiative Russia China vaccine diplomacy.

This seems extremely reasonable indeed probably way global crisis. rich countries keep 95% vaccines share 5% developing nations, drop bucket rich countries make world difference ones receiving donations (since they'll able prioritize health care workers vulnerable). study‚Äî that‚Äôs important. Pfizer, Moderna J&amp;J also reported 100% death rate people died, it‚Äôs astronomically small number (.000something). probably people die even vaccine, number going extremely small.  may help you. Right sounds like bro ""vocal antivaccine"" stage, means longer way ""acceptance"" 2 shot What, lab created drugs, alcohol, tobaccos?

I'm honestly sure texas big problem. felt getting rid mask mandate premature risky, Texas numbers still going down

It seems like people still taking precautions enough places still requiring precautions, even government requiring it

I've read people concerned cases texas explode soon. might right, hope they're forget that, even somehow manage get restrictions place, sheriffs refused enforce previous orders. two choices. call panic train top medical experts deciding stop AZ vaccinations something look right. something started FB/WhatsApp. Another thing people obviously aware what's going they're several months behind news science. recovered acutely feeling sick (such fever) longer meet requirements quarantine. pharmacies vaccination sites using rule 14 days first felt sick tested positive. get one, likely fine, something can't say sure getting COVID

Yes, clearly one unresolved feelings self worth. thought entire cornerstone UKs lockdown strategy prevent hospitals overwhelmed, eliminating covid altogether. Given almost vulnerable people fully vaccinated within week two, concern? understand graph all. US bought enough cover 455 million people. That's bad somehow?

That's completely irrelevant argument. article nothing whether ""infringing rights"" sufficient argument. article people believe react attempts convince otherwise.

Whether argument right change fact believe it, according study even attempting convince wrong actually opposite affect intended. trying convince wrong, reinforcing belief right.

The question is, actually trying convince people wear masks, trying win argument? $11 billion rounding error we're talking government budgets.

given consequences funding vaccine development production we're seeing around world, I'd argue countries can't afford spend money understand annoy you. choice vaccine vaccine B, vaccine vaccine B unspecified time future. 

If offered vaccine UK, either older vulnerable age group. declining it, run risk getting hospitalised Covid time wait vaccine choice. arriving current guidance, UK health authorities concluded people like (meaning people age condition) \*more\* chance catching Covid hospitalised next 15 days bad affect vaccine. that's next 15 days. wait longer vaccine, odds go higher.

In refusing vaccine \*now\* therefore taking bigger risk health take it.

I see way bullying NHS, I'm glad say would appear vast majority offered vaccine country, clearly think either, they've accepted it. Doh! Haha way japan's administration handled whole covid situation almost par brazil, lucky folks wear masks anyway prior pandermic.... type blood clots people get birth control, pregnancy, post partum, different type blood clot less lethal easily treatable clots vaccine give.

Do realize poor discourse here? start admitting lockdowns correlation positivity rates, especially long run? anyone even studied stay home notices preventing people gathering outdoors herd immunity? admit none worth cost going keep pretending Texas Florida exist? suggestion metrics used? personally think 60 percent full vaccination country would best ease restrictions, all. understanding metric proposed Fauci, except said 70 percent vaccination. Media management. Undertesting, undercounting deaths common. Even today, officially 2 deaths day due Covid districts crematoriums waiting list - people dying get in! furnace frames made metal melting burning non-stop week. Well we've repeatedly told inferior healthcare system compared everyone else. would anyone want help? We're incompetent, focusing ourselves.

The rest world looking pillars healthcare competency, like Europe.   incredible video I‚Äôve seen describing shouldn‚Äôt base vaccine reliability efficacy rating given them. J&amp;J tested much worse time pandemic tested time also protect people new variants compared Pfizer tested case numbers lower weren‚Äôt worrying much vaccine resistant variants confusion ? small chance blood cloth question still take vaccine ? cuz care die tough balance. suspect stroke, standard procedure STAT head CT make sure there's bleed brain, give anti-thrombolytic (clot buster) try dissolve presumptive clot that's causing stroke.

Benefit early enough might dissolve clot, restore blood flow, minimize damage stroke. cases someone dense stroke symptoms like garbled speech weakness affecting entire side body gets tPA within minutes function restored.

BUT, ordinary medication. functions dissolving clots, also means may cause bleed. That's urgent CT first make sure already bleeding. stroke, benefits dissolving clot far outweighs smaller risk bleeding. bunch people showing Bells Palsy, getting mistaken stroke patients, receiving tPA, got benefit, risk, people may suffer catastrophic bleeds head good reason.  I'm responding vent attempting talk things going way many others want go.

Forgive bristling bit ""wear masky uwu"" line sounds similar lot antimaskers talk situation. pay people $100 get shots require kids attending public schools like vaccines.

Those two things would probably get us 90% immunity.  find explanations satisfactory. Daily new cases daily new deaths 15X month ago.

I quick google found 12 million Germans age 25 35. gave AZ jab get 36 deaths (based 3 deaths every million). compares 153 age range die next 3 months (that calculated). risk benefit still vastly favour given jab. 


As said 30s UK much much less covid Germany risk benefit changed AZ. thing happening Brazil. political war going judiciary reopening churches massive crowds zombies give minimum wage psychopathic religious leaders like Edir Macedo also owns second biggest tv channel close ally Bolsonaro.

And pharmacists haven‚Äôt always giving shots themselves, that‚Äôs people got fewer shots. Pharmacists giving people routine vaccines 20 years now. That‚Äôs brand new thing although pharmacists still don‚Äôt all

In like two months, yeah, it‚Äôll make sense individually packaged doses you‚Äôre bringing minimum six temperature control time. make sense doctor‚Äôs offices hand freezer cold anyway. 

But still distribution drug. prophylactic drug treating condition preventing it. pharmacy appropriate accessible venue choose, keep booking get offered one want. one stops this. 

You book, turn up, hear vaccine have, cancel rebook actually kind get choice.

But enough supply people able actively choose, UK government won‚Äôt offload supply countries UK citizens unvaccinated India hasn‚Äôt vaccinated nearly large portion population compared America. Jerk snap too, apparently.

I wonder crackle pop also increasing... Consider ""following science"" rapidly means public tolerate whiplash data comes changes understanding...

Don't think public that. Hence policy decisions lag significantly.

I love quick data spread also hate it. Love me, hate general population/media. general people suck changing views data comes in. Makes important wait saying anything. flu totally different virus. different versions flu type A, B C. Covid19 caused one virus only, although different strains similar genetically. vaccine flu targets likely seasonal strains. Vaccine covid targets one specific coronavirus.

Can't find vaccinated truck drivers? they're ones spreading Covid, make requirement. Remember, US everyone eligible. gotta get done. prove second dose chance causing issues first fine take otherwise imagine statistics suggest risk second dose UK follow Sweden/Germany/France recommend different second dose. Several states ended religious exemptions vaccination last decade. completely religious gatherings election rallies. People stopped wearing masks giving fuck long time ago. Schools, colleges, local trains everything else opened zero regards mask wearing social distancing.

Anything that, really isn‚Äôt viable us. It‚Äôs complete sh*t show area. Walmart site near didn‚Äôt even updated vaccine schedule(like 16+ etc) couldn‚Äôt even try there. It‚Äôs call cutting reduction oxygen brain horrific. I‚Äôm sorry loss pain family going through...    really annoys people continue advocating AZ saying stuff like ""it's still safer catching covid"" ""you chance dying car assuming binary choice AZ vaccine catching covid, works all. 


That assumption implicit latter claim, true. higher chance dying 20 mile car journey taking AZ vaccine, people generally think nothing risks. presumably wouldn't, example, insist nurse come house give Pfizer jab, rather make 20 mile journey get it. So, agree reluctance strange one.

For reason, I'll happily take AZ offered. though like. people seeing what‚Äôs happening India.. densely stupid coolest door opener seen sensor wave hand front of. touch door automatically opens. know deliberately hidden. know Netherlands vaccination fill form tick box agree information used research privacy laws. everybody gives consent precise figures per age group/gender known. rough idea though. GP get contact JCVI talk giving patients whatever vaccine choose. 


I suspect get far. I'm sorry dude, one answer you. one. Epidemiology many variables. on/off switch that's gonna get flipped weeks. could make something up, ethical, advisable, one variables fucks trajectory, people pissed.

A good example variable foresee pause J&amp;J. That, thankfully, pretty small one, things considered, cause vaccine rollout slow down. actual research done Leiden Dutch, production handed Belgians add top :) outbreak involved variant virus multiple mutations spike protein, kind make vaccines less effective. Vaccinated residents health care workers Kentucky facility less likely infected vaccinated, far less likely develop symptoms. study estimated vaccine, identified Pfizer-BioNTech, showed effectiveness 66 percent residents 75.9 percent employees, 86 percent 87 percent effective protecting symptomatic disease. 

 Unvaccinated people act incubators mutations these. actually rare. 6 young people died 140,000 AstraZeneca vaccinations Norway. really think 6 people killed Norway every 140,000 car journeys. would work every car Norway allowed one trip every two half years. ridiculous comparison. extreme underreporting. Two reasons:

1. Numbers fudging govt.
2. People know covid positive obvious get tested.

I family state Gujarat, numbers reported easily less 10% actual numbers. Cases &amp; deaths.

India likely least million cases day right now. surprise 2 million, even. can't imagine guilt nursing home worker must feel get readily available vaccination, and/or failed use correct PPE.

The fact variant even ""one concern"" informs us getting vaccinated ASAP paramount importance.

We saw first recorded death P1 Pasco, Florida reported week: 96 year old female. *This starts.* 25% Americans planning refuse it

Only 8% prison guards getting it

About 40% marines refusing it

I'm curious formula used spit 50 percent number. ideas produced fakes?  really understand this. numbers continue fall, news never positive. love phrase ""Covid endgame"". Get rekt, Covid! greatly reduce likelihood death, eliminate entirely. search 1 Clemson/Georgia ticket Charlotte September. 

Man it‚Äôs gonna feel good full capacity stadium Honestly, global vaccine production ramps lot countries preemptively secured supplies vaccinated, rich countries like South Korea end perfectly fine. thing Korea community spread low *can* wait months. Meanwhile, NA EU, two orders magnitude people die per capita, daily lives interrupted pandemic more. +1 me, too. got home second jab. It‚Äôs already me, don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre talking Thanks info

Surprised catalent got AZ manufacturing USA - catslent fill&amp;finish J&amp;J catalent indiana plant. guess j&amp;j still merck manufacturing usa (Biden's partnership plan) catalent manufacturing italy.

So even though AZ got kicked Emergent, theyre totally usa manufacturing, much urgency find replacement (no doubt replacement helps increase total covid doses available) missed news way back Aug main hurdle knowing exactly take wane yet. 

Likely want positive immunity lasts least 12 months granting full approval. study tracks vaccine recipients similar control group timeframe environment spread. I‚Äôm Canadian US work today. Walked grocery store appointment gave one (thank you). really weird. Maybe Sinovac isn‚Äôt really effective? l plan keep mask afterwards. covid, though. went mask frequently pandemic, never allergy/flu/cold/fever whole pandemic.
I hope people around judge, like first put mask Feb 2020 Based E484K mutation, would say relatively good vaccine news. Obviously sad people died, gives good idea expect mRNA vaccines variants mutation, seems ‚Äúthe‚Äù problem mutation far vaccine efficacy goes. Yeah, guy work tantrum saying forced wear mask would leave never return. loudly publicly.

He still works there, he's forced consistently wear mask. Tyra Banks, you? Vaccinations need mandatory health workers like nursing home. That's ridiculous! higher efficacy Pfizer? positive note: USA ascend Covid Hell, country can. wait vaccines ramp look who‚Äôs telling us health, Bill Gates, Bill Nye, Albert Bourla. one even see problem? 1) That‚Äôs single case report knows exactly complications patient post therapy. still doesn‚Äôt explain fact currently IFR 20%. Diagnosis incredibly difficult

2) said, literally enough data second doses, particularly amongst risk. actual fact, last yellow card report actually reported 1 case post second vaccination.

3) Countries sensibly restricting vaccine based cost risk analysis. political move would like be, steeped science public health. world pandemic lack vaccine drastically changes risk analysis, weren‚Äôt pandemic could get access better vaccines risks course vaccine would chucked (Denmark) indeed medium term be, it‚Äôs good junk medium term developed world. fact UK lucky countries picked issues, it‚Äôs reporting system obviously doesn‚Äôt work Europe nudged UK realised also happening there. UK herd immunity much greater vaccine related cost Israel, US, Germany probably end France oh variants going fuck UK AZ.

Anyway damage done vaccine, it‚Äôs dangerous Covid alternatives sizeable chunk population that‚Äôs lucky health authorities power restricted unlike would happily see unnecessary death healthy young people get pint pub Oook low united states sooo bad need vaccine supply genius? recommends children get four doses polio vaccine. get one dose following ages:  months old  months old  18 months old  6 years old

Hmmm.... kindergarten starts around age 5. Probably last polio vaccine age 4. need vaccine need schools require it.

Also Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) polio vaccine given United States since 2000.

If anything, governments US far loose restrictions statistics would suggested prudent. fact right Michigan that's case - numbers alone, totally locked again, least weeks. Whitmer locking us down, likely we're vaccinating quickly, also deaths bit due vaccination.

I get impression somewhat forward looking - expect see issue future sort thing (based behavior vaccinated now). technically speaking whole state doesnt residency requirements. vaccinated california matter residency status citizenship status, thats actually works vast majority states. also cant deny getting vaccinated dont show id, thats also state works. said, facts arent well advertised people still get spooked getting asked show id even tho dont actually Yes that's need right SEAN PENN! \s think attributing exclusively anti-vax bit misguided. concerning growing cohort mindset, suspect real motivation laziness lack care, particularly younger, healthier individuals. fact, expect would find flu vaccine far worse uptake group covid. Bay Area come Central Valley get shot pretty easily - niece got one CVS yesterday didn‚Äôt even appointment. near LA try Riverside - hear lot people luck too. CVS, Walgreens etc don‚Äôt residency requirements. real truth universal healthcare people Reddit refuse admit. 

It's also possible lot Redditors universal healthcare also supplemental insurance realize bad things without it. say hesitancy, would say apathy. People want schedule appointment something almost definitely kill they'll still wear mask. ""Better safe sorry"" attitude behind restrictions created ""Why bother"" attitude public, politicians want people get vaccinated better catch up. me, hate say it, there's lot resentment way around. people go party congregate without masks like big deal, thus prolonging everything responsible among us; wife, took precautions extreme let order takeout go office year; courts (I'm lawyer) anxious force attorneys start trying cases courtrooms early June 2020 safe congregate building; politicians Florida US prior January 2021 willing sacrifice health family's health improve economic numbers political ends; news outlets fanned flames fear sell clicks point hard even know seriously take news more.

I mad hell almost everyone, feel like year+ life stolen me. Got Covid, Cautionary Tale: 

I'm 23M works poker dealer. received first vaccine two weeks ago thought nearly invincible living covid-free year. Two coworkers tested positive started experiencing mild symptoms (mostly cough tiredness.) took antigen test came back negative, still slightly symptomatic.

I stayed home work night thought chance false negative, room desperately needed another dealer (because two home sick.) felt pressure manager come didn't. next day took PCR test got result: Positive.

I wanted share young people may think disease because: 


* symptoms far milder they've seen news
* already gotten first dose vaccine
* took antigen test shortly exposure symptoms returned negative
* They're young immune system somehow deal it

It's worth getting PCR test! takes minute, free, uncomfortable. Especially cases rise, important get tested soon feel symptoms. many illnesses going around rn masks feel sick there's good chance corona. 

 
Thanks reading almost shit myself. Wasn‚Äôt stress. happened middle night  counties many Iowans traveling order get vaccine month ago. counties vaccination residents while.  people even reading beyond title? rule basically asking create hybrid work environment. work done remotely, let employee remote needs person, work person.

I know theory AstraZeneca perform well due immunity viral vector itself. So, let's say someone able get two doses either ChAdOx1 AstraZeneca vaccine, Ad26 J&amp;J vaccine, Ad5 CanSino vaccine.

Would one able expect similar level efficacy Sputnik V vaccine?

In thread, could combined Sputnik/AstraZeneca trials Russia Azerbaijan example planing 3rd adenovirus booster future immunity wanes? thats definitely true young. however, young constitute everyone hasnt vaccinated yet, lot 40, 50, even 60 year olds havent gotten jab. them, cant really blame laziness much hesitancy since well, probably tell aint getting lol mean, one hand agree pushing benefits vaccine rather playing risks.

Correct, majority population vaccinated. missed key word-household density.

I agree seasonality huge issue well. course lockdowns work.

No, popular Twitter Twitter-user sphere well. ironic true. vaccine passports directly linked government IDs. America, basically scribbles piece paper.

Foreign ships (all cruise boats) cannot carry passengers exclusively within US Thanks dude hope guys start better go back normal. I'm obedience, choice.

I think majority Americans, always ""because law says to"". Theyre foreign ships staffed foreign crews. cant dock US soil lol great thank much!!! I'd curious see implemented could go back time. series shorter ""hard"" lockdowns instead months half-assed lockdowns really resorted to. We've seen effective last hard lockdown UK winter, case decline happening well vaccines took effect. Imagine month long hard lockdown last April, another August, short pre-thanksgiving lockdown, pre-christmas lockdown, additional longer one Jan/Feb. Especially could timed targeted stimulus business support. Gov. Dan McKee said state ready lift mask mandates. also said Tuesday that, 70% Rhode Islanders fully vaccinated, restrictions may loosen. McKee expects happen June 5.

Credit credit due, giving potential end-date. feelings exactly. widely-distributed vaccines, restrictions lifted. someone still afraid leave house, that's prerogative. Please let go play. know state apparently DC one that's ""all time"". stop world isolate every individual techniques used isolation rooms hospitals...now practical that?

Grow up. wore masks public places. Viruses get around. Try working hospital see fucking impossible stop organisms escaping single room everybody goes super careful.

The idea simply lockdown highly infectious virus widespread global village simply ignorance simple biology. course guys like Fauci going encourage mitigation use brain. can't stop thing wearing masks.

Pretty concerning IMO. people‚Äôs finances I'm paying it. lol like optimism changes, good, im telling you, likely wont block IP law

This nothing IP law, countries (including Japan course) enforce has, apparently, fueled US's for-profit vaccination research. every company made vaccine unwilling partner Japanese companies make them? Japanese pharma company capable putting together candidate vaccine join dozens/hundreds around world?

Vaccine production purely monetary economic issue. Many wealthy countries just...chose ignore it. 2nd oldest population country along fairly unhealthy too. two main factors. They've actually less 65 plus die per capita states. 

As someone said economy open pretty well. equation covid cases Public doesn‚Äôt want make vaccines mandatory enter football stadiums Dude didnt read read responding. countries travel right Fox news appears use pretty consistently text stories doubt expensive, I'm saying housing crisis US need affordable housing well, especially larger cities. salaries white-collar professionals high places like NYC silicon valley, high cost housing priced working class. actually outdoors mask ""mandate"" doesnt apply social distance, unless protest something, nobody expects wear mask. afaik pretty much cdc recommendation Jesus protect me! Yah florida currently flowing tourism completely open. They're testing entire college population weekly like california either. cousin dorms gets tested twice week school. Florida coworkers know get tested they're sick. Heck work many people need get tested every week still clients. think thats really issue here. Likewise, even defines ""hint anti-masking"" ""bad faith"" here? Let's say, hypothetically, hit point June July community spread minimal vaccine hesitant form resistance covid section scientific community saying continue wear masks covid 100% eradicated another saying social costs high. allowed weigh views scientists recommend masking? happens ""science"" we're supposed follow begins disagree amongst itself? Hopefully Israel well. one calling 100 mil 100 days ""lofty"". pace Biden took office, even vaccine production ramped up. speaking specifically Covid-19 vaccinations...

OP: E N E R N G agree post, someone needs tell Biden CDC still saying part even fully vaccinated, keep wearing mask, stay home, gather crowds/groups, etc...

I think going make people get vaccine figuring, ""why get vaccine still wear mask rest life, avoid crowds, stay home, etc., etc"" read area wants drop mask mandate 50 percent vaccinated. Given 30 percent vaccinated we've already hit demand wall warned could last end summer 12-15 year olds get vaccinated. Personally I'm dropping mask next month. I'm it. Gottlieb boy question wuhan got hit bad? Maybe wuhan infected since like summer 2019 people asymptotic. what's states like Florida Texas basically piles dead bodies months locked really enforcing much mask mandate? think hospitals would full 24/7 point. Correct. 

99.3% them. Curfews odd one. one hand, concentrate people actually may counter-productive. hand, make awkward go about, reducing contacts.

I think focused much indoor vs outdoor. course raises uncomfortable questions offices classrooms. Boston-based partner Atea Pharmaceuticals (AVIR.O) hoping AT-527 pill could offer anti-viral therapy treat COVID-19 patients would easier administer cheaper prospective treatments, antibody cocktails Gilead Science's (GILD.O) remdesivir. interview Swiss media early March, Roche Chairman Christoph Franz offered tantalizing prospect data AT-527 ""within next weeks"", saying dreamed able fight pandemic pill year's end. Britain's success reducing case numbers swift vaccination programme strict lockdown meant taking longer expected collect data trial there, said Bill Anderson, head Roche's pharmaceutical division. wish could upvote more. kind disturbing American hear CDC director say almost everyday ""The worst yet come, yet long time, expect get worse"".

It's even alarming message complete vaccination still - ""stay home, keep social distance, eat inside restaurant, etc.. etc.."". type messaging worry telling people ""why get vaccine? already stuff before. get one change anything"" ? Jesus man! intentionally playing dumb something? US hoarded multiple times supply needed manufacture 300 mn doses. Thats whole point argument.

Let's say need 100,000 pounds RAW materials produce 300 doses. US hoarded 3 million pounds RAW material since late last year.

Even US lifts ban starts exporting, create single dent wave rollout. still going get 200 doses Pfizer Moderna, 100 doses JNJ.

That's world urging US. Atleast resume partial supply let companies like Serum Institute India start manufacturing large scale save thousands lives months.

Is really hard understand America selfishly hoarded RAW materials despite securing receiving majority doses according deals?


And PS5 commodity Luxury Vaccines aren't. PS5 made one company, vaccines made many.

Are really dense comparing PS5 vaccines? Christ! Y'all really blinded individualism. Nobel would go scientists original mRNA research. famous persons today used mRNA COVID scientific significant. hope right, really see it. think masks public part life America years come. Maybe necessarily outdoors outdoor gatherings, inside stores, restaurants, etc. remember even government one day changes mind says ""We think need mask anymore"", NOTHING stop private businesses stores require it.

Some states already made masks part permanent law workplace safety. Texas dropped mandate, individual stores still said ""we still require them"". divide right there, still think one day government require per say, private businesses, Wal-Mart, etc., still will. see Denmark full speed ahead Coronapas.

How Europeans feel possibility rolled across EU? I've spent lot time Germany individual privacy really important I'm struggling gauge go there, example. manufacturer orders countries fulfilled them. Govt India often using deliveries PRb exercise. 

Plus place big enough order help manufacturer funds increase capacity. 

Now they've asked manufacturers, SII, stop fulfilling commitments. Technically true (although much longer?) got fight realize it. Hospitals healthcare providers keeping quiet billing patients families usual. need start thinking plan vaccinations continue slow down. simply cannot case restrictions continue wait get 60% vaccinated 80% vaccinated, happen glacial pace. 

Someone (preferably federal level, coalition states would good start) needs say: We're opening everything July 1st. Get shots own. need help getting shots, fill form we'll send appointments nearby. loved roller coasters....not tho mutated little last year number infected relatively small; however, greater number virus hosts, greater number mutations.

That could known last year, people decided burry head sand. sometimes impression history pandemic history denial. U.S. entered precarious limbo period pandemic, nation teetering edge tipping point win battle virus, succumbing yet another deadly surge. India vaccinated less 9% population first dose. Plenty unvaxxed newly vaxxed people, young old suffer this. people really good following rules, even rules stupid. probably never fully eliminated, serious smallpox polio largely eliminated persistent vaccination campaigns.

Covid affects elderly far young, time elderly either vaccinated, recovered die, leaving next generation least partially fully immune, cases among less severe, like common cold flu.

Depending happens variants serious could booster shots, maybe one maybe annually every years. Many believe turn common cold flu. Got 2nd shot Pfizer yesterday. Arm kinda sore around injection site thats it, side effects far. Similar Delhi well Hysterical hyperbole helpful. anyone panics, ""major"" similar mutations current escape variants (e.g. Brazil, South Africa, India). ""vaccines useless"" ""reinfection certain"". really early draw kinds conclusions though, especially considering many mitigation measures still place we've never used flu. 6 ft wife too? Basically West Bengal Bangladesh, nobody ships oxygen long distance. SF everyone wears mask, indoors outdoors, exception eating drinking proud city this. Meanwhile went back university Socal year, like third people saw wear masks outside. surprise Socal terribly entire pandemic. Prime minister's target make India manufacturing hub, think way show world India capable mass production. got vaccinated Sputnik V, antibody test came back positive. fair UK hardly vaccine manufacturing capacity prior covid invested heavily getting whatever running. still exporting tons raw materials necessary places' manufacturing.

USA hand, sitting tons unused unapproved doses may never actually even approved blocking raw material exports leading hugely reduced manufacturing capacity primarily India. works people it. California barely anyone uses mobile Covid app, making basically pointless. CA one US states would expect used most.

Of course go Singapore/Taiwan/Korea route making mandatory probably fly Western countries... exception MBBS Vaccine envy real. Sitting around seeing appeared friends getting vaccine even get appointment disheartening. Finally got second dose late March. 

Still going out. Spouse cancer still needs stay away people. envious. CZ still waiting... 55 vaccines??  really botched Fukushima cleanup--they're planning releasing nuclear waste sea; maybe gov't inefficient mess. They're sitting lot vaccines. link tentative timeline Jan. probably one US state double country's gdp imported virus make sense take time spreading rural areas less travel.

""You always count Americans right thing they've tried everything else."" pretty old saying, there's nothing new this. Basically vaccines matter made stimulate immune system way. different ways deliver thing get react way. cook potato oven microwave saucepan looks tastes different still potato. UK blocking export vaccines. technically EU (though technically country) is, even though them. Putting aside ignorance lack information, easily accepted Government India enough preventing wave. However, country exported 65 million doses, could've easily used people.

Do understand term herd immunity? pandemic truly unless share supplies.

India little still shared world. US covered majority vulnerable population still hoarding supplies. 

I swear sometimes look americans' perspectives world lose faith humanity. long richest greatest country world. Now, US participates vaccine diplomacy supply outpaces demand, think it‚Äôs something worth applauding.


They will, otherwise they'll hundreds millions doses sitting freezers. US ordered &amp; paid billions doses need send where. dis? new variants seem appeared countries particularly bad virus outbreak. Lithuania seems confirm rule since country one worst outbreaks Europe December.

Unfortunately, article clear mutations variant whether import, recombination local variant. China macro example is. get 2nd dose tomorrow kids get first doses today Friday. interesting week.  I‚Äôm visiting U.S. summer

Unless US citizen getting in. US still bans travel EU past 14 days. may change way right US passport, green card married American. get frustration around interruption manufacturing use Pfizer/Moderna vaccines, happened J&amp;J (they've problems), vaccinations US would abruptly stop. AZ backup plan one week's supply current pace.

I hope US turns corner start sharing vaccines Canada rest world. think we're yet. Im yet see single picture India without hanging noses even talking about? literally comparing two different things! problem EU world getting vaccines time due US banning exports hoarding supplies.

This nothing pricing funding. Although EU specifically invested 2.7 bn BionTech. Stop peddling misinformation. EU month behind striking deals vaccine makers getting fucked ""*months*"" delay deliviries due US hoarding.

Read comments person explained thread. spouting nonsense again. Let give example. 


If book car day american friend manufacturer says get car 3 months later american american hoarding supplies needed building car, inspite booked day, rightfully pissed.

Stop peddling misinformation man! read comments sources given reputible news outlets. EU going beyond limits bring pandemic control. add this, US loaned 4M doses [sitting ""tens millions"" yeah, lot US doing. We're already starting hit point supply outstrips demand, know anyone justify US sitting AZ. First Moderna shot, arm pain insane. hurt like hell going days afterwards every time moved it. honestly wonder whether woman screwed somehow because, 5 weeks on, still bruise hurts move certain way!

Other that, headache felt flu-ey utterly exhausted 24 hours.

Right schedule, week later, got ""Moderna arm"" lasted couple days.

Shortly 2 week mark days feeling awful - weak, exhausted, nausea generally feeling like shit. unusual really, especiallly right period, 2 3 full whole room spinning dizzy spells really scared I've never, ever experienced before. period seemed much heavier usual. honestly idea vaccine side effects entirely unrelated.

I got second shot arm though sore nowhere near bad first. got ""Moderna arm"" reaction 3 days nowhere near bad which, again, apparently people.

The headache exhaustion bad first shot, got chills pretty badly first night lot body aches first days.

It's week hope worry much side effects I'm bit worried next 2 week mark/period brings... Reality often terrifying uncomfortable one ignores long. 

I hope everyone pays attention time actually works together collectively rather individually. global community poor job taking seriously first time around stuck triple mutation realities multiple continents God knows many animal human bounce backs.  Also wear mask nose well, limit amount viral exposure. Damn sounds bad. likely either intermittent booster shots (1-3 years), mutations relevant, herd immunity keeping epidemics local sporadic, waning immunity time. Complete eradication really plausible, likely bounce back animal reservoirs. mask (N95) risk getting acne saving life sounds like hysterical stand defend something that's still clear me.

just like covidiots hard classify kind people come absurdities like one.  hope car. can't see anyone smokes much able safely operate motor vehicle. doses question purchased owned US government. contracts US signed include clauses saying cannot exported used outside United States; US got discount better terms exchange waiving manufacturer liability.

The US working solutions using doses anyway; ‚Äúloaned‚Äù Canada Mexico, skirts contractual clause. US also providing vaccines neighboring countries ways: one example, also begun vaccinating Canadian truck drivers (North Dakota currently piloting idea). Northern Beaches Sydney (where got caught one tiny corner Australia Christmas 2020) would maybe upper limit micro, Victoria definitive macro possibly realistic upper limit that.

And probably possible Victorians take execute quite seriously states slammed borders shut effect tight transit controls.

And still took months number persistent pockets disease flare ups finally months later dropped zero stayed there. Border area residents may wind crossing getting jabs US sites already seem make rules. Soon vaccine appointments go unfilled point get across border, like chances. lot friends got vaccinated ahead schedule put right place right time. Expiring doses find way arm. gotta put -- wait someone contact you.  Sorry meant opposite. can't really imagine outside enough room stay 6ft others  DC too, pretty rad Doesn‚Äôt mean fox reporter wasn‚Äôt stupid enough call lofty I‚Äôm selling water portable pee toilets.

I‚Äôd still say need empathy. Even you‚Äôve WFH entire time, you‚Äôve still made sacrifices, you‚Äôve still aware ramifications pandemic, you‚Äôve still effected way.

Not belittle sacrifices essential workers, healthcare workers, etc, recognizing we‚Äôve lived pandemic, believe deserve empathy time get back normal, whatever may be. Yes Travel advisories Americans traveling country. people traveling America. think happen NZ really lot say it, going back office boss? Ok, see there. guess idea point making article supposed support it. Japan rich country, btw: one ones funding vaccine production entire world, instead spending (?)nothing.

I'm making point merits IP suspension. nothing incompetence many rich nations funding vaccination population. Friend mine side effects kick like 14 hours second shot Pfizer. second one next week, thought side effects would kick right away, sounds like I'm gonna need day off. first one bad, kinda tingly like comin something. Oh get pesky facts! /s

Seriously though, that‚Äôs point many miss. even tried get company here, said no, wasn‚Äôt facility could use. Hence facility Novovax won‚Äôt ready end year (maybe fall, we‚Äôll see). built first.  Melbourne (Australia) we've recently removed mask mandate everywhere except public transport/rideshare many healthcare settings. 

Life pretty much returned normal here, except need wear mask train work. I'm currently getting covid (isolation ended week ago) lost filling tonight. odds seeing tonight? 7 day rolling average 950,000 day Biden took office. cracked million dose day average mark two days later. 100 mil 100 days foregone conclusion already. vaccinated effectively means spreading virus. benefit wearing mask vaccinated negligible. think CDC needs learn thing two you? trust they're correct say vaccinated effectively eliminates spread.

And getting vaccinated somehow *doesn‚Äôt* protect COVID, what‚Äôs point getting vaccinated?

I agree current messaging poor. I‚Äôm vaccinated ready go back normal.  someone isnt going wear mask *save people's lives*, really think they're gonna spend extra 30 seconds flossing?

Yes, do. I'm sure people post stuff like this. do. peer reviewed. widely available. lawsuits, full indemnity vaccine manufacturers. yes I‚Äôve asked multiple times insert kids‚Äô vaccines, yet see one. licking machine :) say NYC hits new low. Pretty much yea. see people without masks outside far between. 
At least Honolulu. fairly clear vaccine production longer bottleneck US, no? Moreover, J&amp;J / AstraZeneca doses piling use-able Buzz mulatto 3.3million day total number shots given day vaccines using (well right now) 2 shots. that's like 7 weeks rather 3 weeks best case, yeah probably slow approach closer 80% said.  blame lies entirely Japan's government thinking COVID would never get bad enough require mass vaccinations. they've caught unprepared - oh there's global sporting event 3 months. here.

Also, lot people even get tested. die, reported man think saying thing 4 A380s crashing every day coast Bombay. mention, reliable data reporting India lately, would slightly surprise death figure missing zero. average house county around $800k 2 bedrooms. America Ohio Arkansas. Gonna ease back I‚Äôm excited 1.5 hours outside LA $400k would would still amusingly cheap. Like...stupidly cheap. You‚Äôre funny clever, LOL! think that's pretty unclear people who've it. Poor communications. Goodness, forever! I'm confident vaccine tech outrun nature one day. couldnt jack Spanish Flu think convinced world medical research woefully under-funded. 

And anyway, like shave often, coffee stained teeth nobody see, face isnt data mined security cameras everywhere, throw bandana top pretend I'm wild west train robber - list goes on! Masks dope  sound stupid. Indian coworkers tell grossly understated. Like 10x more. I‚Äôve actually read dozens comments Canadians last week calling Americans ‚Äúselfish‚Äù vaccinating population instead sending Canada, please don‚Äôt act like speaking Canadians. Plenty guys salty it. think CDC ever intended things act vaccine passports. They're glorified appointment reminders. 

Just like we've bastardized SSNs abomination now... DoEsN‚Äôt SpReAd ScHoOls‚Äù,

It spread schools much. certainly spreads children, especially adults. confuse children infected children infecting others school environment. Correlation causation. That‚Äôs one opinion. list countries high enough vaccination rates college-aged people would getting also using FDA-approved vaccines vanishingly small.

A lot countries using AZ substantial portion vaccination efforts. I'll shocked AZ ever gets approval US. college-aged students gotten vaccinated *now* need think about, college-aged students vaccinated fall semester starts August/September. Aruba open. going make joke Montenegro never closed borders, list actually short 6 months ago, I'll [share this] . reality, UK consistently ranked among healthiest teeth world quite now. Mind sharing get masks? potential source N95s dried up. joining masking forever respect lot connections teams Pfizer, Moderna, Biontech. could probably collect 20 names involved development commercialization mRNA vaccine. want Chinese vaccine? we're 38th First Krispy Kreme guys, I'm pretty okay people coming vaccine rewards programs. Outdoor mask mandates always unscientific Scope =/= education

Scope =/= respect

Scope =/= hard word

Scope == tens millions dollars spent state lobbying practice privileges

Check [this posted comparing education family medicine physician family nurse practitioner. going see huge difference. difference education FM physician FNP greater difference RN FNP. call game second period. Half battle vaccine acceptance states seriously plateauing 40% US gave 1.2B Operation Warp Speed.

We're 20 days behind states first shots track 3rd major country finish using western vaccines (probably second doubt USA gets 70%) Oh we‚Äôre closing anything Michigan. Whitmer admins traveling abroad. We‚Äôre done. Here's hoping open voulentary injections Norway may 10th announcement. Yeah OP put indigenous scare quotes Ayurveda vaccine government promoting Surprised didn‚Äôt get downvoted oblivion saying this. legal weed vaccines NZ :-( Biden's fault came late USA marketed masks vaccines pictures Uncle Sam branded serving country akin WW2 would whole different story. Oh that's wonderful, American usually check FDA situation Brazil likely get **much** worse gets better. :/

And India. Thailand. God knows what‚Äôs really going China Russia right now. 

Global vaccinations need step significantly. sides 100% true. feel you, second tomorrow I‚Äôm nervous. Sending good thoughts way side effects minimal. Mississippi stalled 29% almost week now. states definitely starting saturate 

That's mortality rate 1.2% breakthrough infections, quite close general mortality rate virus. Neither.

Also people go crazy I'm progressive showing actual science..

Edit: Here's one Pfizer vaccine. Every vaccine FDA authorized page like don‚Äôt think formal studies, March 14th, 780 people submitted yellowcard report tinnitus like symptoms getting vaccine UK. 

Roughly 1 32,000. However reports, survey, it‚Äôs likely higher many people don‚Äôt go way report side effects. [Apparently people Prague 'ignorant' enough believe live Texas, btw. Never left, lol remember March April calling mom upset ex-boyfriend resist us actually staying home first two weeks complete isolation saying ""I told specific household seriously quarantine - like bought month's worth groceries- stay home full clean two weeks symptoms, I'd say good go visit something, clearing mark 'do it, spread it?'"" agree said overreacting. 

Well called mom informed me, gonna two weeks. friend group cant stay home expect world stop enough? organized enough widespread. said ""it's gonna MONTHS, maybe even year need vaccine take time"".... heart sank readjusted expectations. 

I realized normal life come back soon, emphasized important strict rules meantime... draw line No. nurse. RN become NP. Also majority NPs MSN. difference formal medical knowledge RN NP minute. majority NP curriculum nursing leadership nursing theory.

Are NP married one?  Oh yes agree . Gross . Well done ruining it. wasn‚Äôt hospital. 
I don‚Äôt see optometrist hospital, either.

Edit: think misleading. 

I think optometrists, chiropractors, pharmacists, etc misleading. I'm Texas New York bit bad time Covid.

My wife teacher knows teacher come Covid receiving vaccination shots. reminder us even vaccination still risks. variants might get around immune response levels exposure might simply overwhelm immune system vaccinated.

But also reason personal experience optimistic. wife received first shot come Covid did. Obviously, exposure pretty high living small apartment first Moderna shot never developed symptoms weekly Covid tests negative.

What concerns polling data showing people yet vaccinated plan get vaccinated.

People need get vaccinated. actually administered doses per 100 people given average 5% population first dose compared EU

Canada administered almost equal amount doses per 100 EU, 27.1 vs 25.7. big difference EU vaccinated significantly people 2 doses Canada allowing first dose vaccination rate 24% vs 18%. layperson hears ""doctor"" medical setting think physician. Full stop. admitted hospital someone walks room introduces ""Dr. X"" going assume physician, disagree, lying yourself. hospital, going guess person physician, MD DO, nurse practitioner DNP, physician assistant DMSc, physical therapy DPT, pharmacist PharmD, psychologist PsyD, audiologist AuD, chiropractor DC, dentist DMD DDS, medical physicist PhD. medicine doctor = physician/surgeon. Got 2nd Moderna yesterday (Tuesday). Hitting way harder first. Glad part. Wish would same. I‚Äôm getting downvoted expressing re-entry anxiety post re-entry anxiety. Where‚Äôs compassion? may scientifically rational response human one. republicans best kill strongest rural voting block.... Exactly called BS. People don‚Äôt know regulations around vaccine approvals throw away statements like govt promoted local vaccine. Yeah like local vaccine water.

Both vaccines used India proved efficacy trials. It‚Äôs crazy simple yet it‚Äôs rarely stated. Hopefully CDC starts saying soon.  Oh nice, could link? 100% right. needed follow rules. WWII ton rules people actually followed. Today got people pissed able go Applebees. worst mocking tone call overly cautious. judgement it. Treating cautiousness hysteria order justify decisions. That's good idea. lessen coverage amount covid related stuff vaccine refused. Well, considering actually lived country universal health care, think one judge. clue talking about.  indian, concur

Journalists gone person visiting crematoriums burial grounds etc. counting number deaths

The covid related deaths see one place actually official figure whole state (these large states, dozens big cities n hundreds crematoriums/burial grounds)

The authorities asked mark deaths due causes. certain deaths pnuemonia classified covid, everything else marked generic illness sth else.

Noone knows extent deaths, sure way way way 2k day UK peaked 1200 per day bunch restrictions mask mandate place. India 20 times population.  Two months notice international wedding asinine. Even normal times wouldn‚Äôt go. 37 states higher per capita testing Texas. Look worldometers. 

If test 2/3 less, get 2/3 less results. truly truly feel people cultivated massive amount anxiety fear. it‚Äôs hard stay patient claim back science use logic completely contradicts real reason data. It‚Äôs like reading onion article headlines. Yes, is. EU putting big pharma population?? What's crazy many countries exporting far less issues COVID number EU member states. I'm sarcastic. spreading false information corrected you. hospital clarified died incident unrelated vaccine administration.

You need brush difference correlation causation. get vaccine die week later due unrelated incident, there's reason assume they're related.  oh stand corrected. Savage. I've never food stuck teeth... world would ever happen? Corn thing I've eaten would use toothpick that... Nothing else. eating? I'm vegetarian I'm guessing even meat round, vaccine efficacy 78% recorded mild, moderate, severe symptoms Covid-19 based 127 cases.The efficacy severe Covid-19 disease 100%, reduction number hospitalisations. efficacy asymptomatic Covid-19 infections 70%, suggesting decreased transmission Covaxin recipients.  Glad mentioned it, that's like world data. good news is, numbers also 'on rise too'. Finally seems noticable improvement long ways off. might nearing (globally) billion shots per Bloomberg, estimate vaccinate everybody thing 1/14th way there. even know yet, last checked 600 million shots. probably less one shot vaccines, that's estimate. think world data says 2% world fully vaccinated. countries really started. Plus countries areas within countries certain hot spots right always changing.

In US people say state vs others, that's true. Aside Hawaii Alaska, hard keep people traveling. US pretty restrictive foreign travel, still foreigners coming others leaving country last year plus. people going state state throughout entire pandemic, various reasons. they'll bring them.

The reason Alaska Hawaii different, get Hawaii boat plane Alaska two plus car, drive Canada might difficult do.  Despite certain states stringent border checks times many people going places. That's IMO US important number CDC state. waiting listen to? post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Getting vaxxed extremely low risk tons upside, ohh....like living life normally again. choice though. say like that's bad thing. Need internet stranger tell I'm ridiculous. 

the tl;dr: Vaccinated. US. Friend sent save date last year wedding Poland. Yesterday, 2 MONTHS he's getting married, received invite. wedding Poland. global pandemic. I'm terrified losing friend this... ain't going Poland

The longer story:

So buddy's fiancee changed bit. difficult stubborn, works well could difficult stubborn. They're type hold going international wedding. 

So last July got Save Date wedding Poland. thought ""you know what? done Christmas! (lol) I'll owe - I'll trip Europe, swing Poland days... it'll great!"" 

Obviously go planned heard thing while. one friend finally pushed group chat month ago asked going on. said still planning stuff out, *was* happening, figuring guidelines all. 

DIdn't hear thing since then. Yesterday got invite. Now, I'm vaccinated, also understand US well, rest world not, makes uncomfortable. Second, job asking us return office July 1st ‚Äî know... Thursday July 4th. Unreal. think it'd bad optics go back office this, week later turn around like ""going Europe! See ya 2 weeks!"" 

I think I'm going explain return office, it'd bad optics travel internationally right now, I'm gonna able swing it. Simple that. I'm happy celebrate get back.

Also crazy seeing ‚Äúmy family vaccinated. safe us hang out?‚Äù think point getting vaccinated is?

I still understand caution we‚Äôve plenty time see outdoor transmission isn‚Äôt risk. I‚Äôm anti-mask happily wear one store subway return normal point. Shush now. died due unrelated cardiac event. hospital already released comment. Stop spreading misinformation. hope never flown life, ever surgery, done long distant road trips, female birth control give far far far higher chances blood clots AZ vaccine. 

Not mention extremely high prevalence blood clots get covid. shame many people eating fear media laying Yeah friend, couple drinks told probably got covid December get tested county would required quarantine. would still go restaurants work. Next door Illinois positivity rate starting go down. 7 day average peaked 4.4% (knock wood) 4%. happening way round, act high mighty it. US actively blocking raw materials exported pretty low bar clear. article appears paywalled me. someone transcribe suggest free workaround? Many thanks! Sorry hear that!
Getting mine tomorrow. Hope case reverse happens, looking forward considersble worse side-effects :-) I'm saying Illinois' current plan allow businesses reopen full capacity distancing, masks. gym, packed nightclub, indoor weddings, stadiums, churches, schools, stores, etc. open full capacity, everyone required wear mask drinking. water gym, ok. drinking club, ok. dancing, wear mask. Eating wedding cake, ok. ceremony pictures, wear mask. Outside zoo require mask, eating cafe won't. hypocrite incompetent? Find next week!

I unsure trying say ill refrain upvoting downvoting. Seems like Africa always answers phone Chances test negative, also use proof recovery instead. CDC recommend getting tested three months positive viral test, long person symptoms COVID-19. positive viral test past 3 months, met CDC‚Äôs criteria end isolation, may travel instead documentation positive viral test results letter healthcare provider public health official states cleared travel. positive test result letter together referred ‚Äúdocumentation recovery.‚Äù Correct. end socially politically. took nice policemen yo teach can‚Äôt imagine would impossible this, think Biden must aware implications doesn‚Äôt happen soon. hope USA starts loaning 20 million AZ doses sitting there. Maybe South Korea, Canada Mexico? still see people pushing ‚Äúyou still spread virus fully vaccinated keep double masking!‚Äù lines too. They‚Äôve made identity it. mean, India, realise india shithole, least india indeed export ton vaccines, USA, despite broke n poor currently scandal Romania regarding how/if declare current number deaths caused covid. 

So record number now, necessarily mean first time many people die covid. Arrogance, dereliction duty. He's kowtowing interests want invest safety measures institute stricter safety protocols.

There things lie about, new killer virus one, need new leadership institutions failed us Pandemic. vaccines effective safe, blame someone doubting AZ‚Äôs safety Europe‚Äôs response it? blame someone doubting Sinovac‚Äôs efficacy given negative media coverage?

Instead parroting they‚Äôre effective safe, maybe give OP information support that. (See comment him.)

Calling someone doubts ‚Äúthe problem‚Äù makes problem. want hesitant population choose vaccine, need willing dialogue, shame people. dedicated anti-vaxxers whose minds won‚Äôt changed? Sure. also people might misinformed? Absolutely, they‚Äôre same. year comments along lines ""haha stupid americans die"" guess care. pandemic highly suppressed already existing vaccines?

That seems like good problem have.

We're yet. Israel basically declared victory 56% population vaccinated, even started kids. Remember every reported case, probably least 2 3 people become immune (because many unreported cases). Israel believes got finish line, 15% people recovered 56% vaccinated = 71% enough basically halt spread. really need stick together get facts straight here. facts: would, national domestic vaccine passport never going happen reasonable time scale. states finished rolling Real ID compliant IDs yet, bill passed 2005. think there's also subset people get one easy walk-in appointments. Either want figure make appointments, crazy work schedules. want get point way lunch swing CVS, get shot, way. simple lots masks = cases, masks = lots cases. things play. virus path area people affect lot less think. Remember original goal ""flatten curve"", ""prevent every case"". Nobody ever thought masks would perpetually prevent spread... did. reason everyone else slow recognize obvious, respiratory virus mainly spread air, course would need stricter safety protocols governments beholden want forced adopt stricter measures invest new ventilation N-95 otherwise effective masks.

It's shortsighted, investment could re-open quicker instill confidence, leg countries follow suit. Bad leadership around. add, vaccination also lagging effect since takes 2 weeks matter immunity. reported cases reflect vaccine data two weeks, deaths two weeks that.

IMO, think May we'll see real difference we've waiting for. Oh, good hear. headline, situation sounded worse. ICUs (almost) full capacity entire year. scared stay home Poor oral hygiene like, highly correlated everything bad. research common pathology patient questionnaires stated periodontal disease. pathology something would think related all. 

Anyway, that‚Äôs began flossing daily. exactly addled one believe wearing mask equal restricting freedom? 

asking friend Yes, Chicago far demand rest state. entire state already hit vaccination target, single person motivation. Pritzker set 65% threshold removing mask mandate, would potentially see people downstate motivated again. might enough Chicagoans carry us goal. Yeah, also killed famous actor India, maybe calm throwing around numbers like that? reasonable takes covid time. really seems understand proper communication shape says people get whats going on. Seems don‚Äôt know much scope pharmacy. great news virus get you‚Äôre waiting, think issues you‚Äôre citing overhyped media.

Sinovac 50% effective mild infection, 84% effective cases requiring medical intervention, prevents almost moderate severe cases get Sinovac get protection, especially serious complications? mRNA vaccine eventually becomes available country, get that, too. There‚Äôs nothing suggest multiple COVID shots bad you. issue US still stubbornly high cases (e.g. relative UK we're still nearly 5 times higher new cases per capita ignores positivity / testing rate differences many regions). optimistic finally truly final ""mini-peak"" (which barely peak - thanks vaccinations) pretty solid national downward trend out. cases still uncomfortably high states (especially ones like Michigan, albeit looks like peaked well). 

The issue public health messaging hard. People want ""when over?"" date. think message ""when X% population vaccinated less cases per 100K per week"" standard threshold clears (well, probably multiple thresholds: masks probably last go given low economic personal cost wearing them). 

Unfortunately data abstract I'm sure much helps. People understand means relevant. 

The issue simple message ""oh vaccinated, fully protected!"" misleading well. Case load matters. vaccines highly personally protective, completely. 90-95% efficacy symptoms 87-99% efficacy hospitalizations (depending data looking at), mRNA vaccines great. put things perspective: last week, safe eat New Mexico restaurant unvaccinated (50 cases per 100K per week) eat Michigan restaurant vaccinated (500 cases per 100K per week). better protection low case loads. 90% reduction exposure risk roughly ""effective"" vaccines (of course, vaccines also enable us reduce exposure - vaccines - getting many arms possible - important). 

I think get 25 50 cases per 100K per week high enough vaccination percentage, brainer fully open everything party like 1999. again, messaging complex. Yes tested positive week ago mild symptoms. doctor told Friday last day isolation, won‚Äôt contagious. 

I family trip planned Bahamas May 3. realized might fucked, negative PCR test required, tests pick false positives recovered covid people THREE MONTHS. 

Should even bother crossing fingers hoping negative test? cancel hotel portion offer cousin something? basically sacrificing people üòë Preach Urban always wins types things, right? Calling NP doctor far greater misnomer. DNP degree requires 500 clinical hours training, standards training looks like (you need someone sign - could merely shadowing another NP). That's par 3rd year medical student complete 2-3 months (although medical student *does* requirements patient care fulfill), can't graduate many times amount training. That's complete 3+ years residency, too.

Strictly speaking, NPs nurses prepared work bit autonomy RN, disingenuous call doctor hospital clinical setting would call pharmacist, lawyer, professor english doctor. Patients already find kafkaesque medical system overwhelming - business misrepresenting training obscuring key differences professional degrees. Cringe. don‚Äôt remember sick year. Wife REALLY sick last March traveling NYC, never tested positive antibodies. Imagine guy caused that.  bet it‚Äôs bureaucracy. watch Shin Godzilla really think something wrong you. Wtf? üòÇ Texas average US rate infection throughout pandemic. similar. fever shakes (which got 1st) prolonged feeling becoming sick. Lasted 36 hours. second night good! Arm pain went away quicker too. ...do think it‚Äôs *not* possible blood clots form actually diagnosed damage later much later on, skewing data commonality adverse symptoms??  I've heard (anecdotally) Pfizer Moderna, get big reaction first shot already COVID, get second shot COVID vaccination.

My older brother COVID April 2020, got first dose (Moderna) couple weeks back, next day - pretty much slept entire day off.

Everyone else know family got moderna (grandparents + father) reaction first dose whatsoever, second. UK. UK zero production vaccines. Zilch. Nothing can‚Äôt cured bathing magical river/toilet. wear masks? fair, Israel using Pfizer, OP says aren‚Äôt getting vaxxed right country‚Äôs vaccines AZ Sinovac.

But UK largely using AZ great results. UK gamble 1 vaccine, gambled several. AZ fastest come out. know two guys work second shot knocked ass. One guy said even remember day second shot. pretty much experience J&amp;J. also know one guy got J&amp;J said got sore shoulder. completely fine 30ish hours shot well would go back second one knocked ass like that. Floss occasionally cause harm. Careless flossing damage gums, teeth dental work. Though frequency unclear, floss dislodge bad bacteria invade bloodstream cause dangerous infections, especially people weak immunity, according medical literature

I'll leave there. going post that...but tried nice. Thanks. get US? Bro, don‚Äôt start days. Anyways Bharat biotech denied news sting data. Honestly, seeing numbers, understand young, healthy people would hesitant take vaccine, risk getting seriously ill dying COVID smaller 1/70,000.

My worry may many clotting cases yet reported.

Important forget 2020 federal government refused make deal 70 million doses Pfizer vaccine, would made huge difference vaccination progress, even fully delivered. Good results another vaccine helps us fight virus worldwide. Nope, wont let secure first appt without second one. Trust me, I've looking every day. Frys, Walgreens, Kroger's etc first aapts, asks select 2nd dose date order confirm first. I‚Äôll provide proof statements. occasionally cause harm. Careless flossing damage gums, teeth dental work.

Literally bad people still it... I'm surprised people believe science sub... Genuinely.. like amount downvotes I've gotten people hating getting suckered company sells product nothing....I food stuck teeth reason cause keep flossing making space teeth making easier food get teeth...I problem unless go dentist floss teeth next two days I'm worst pain cause it... guys literally making teeth worse worse hilarious me.

It's like falling Nike armour scam worse... end, Novanax Valneva going come bit late, make tangible difference. EU seems focusing projects seem reliable us, terms effectiveness reliability deliveries. 2022, using mRNA vaccines: Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, Curevac.  know Germany, town US tripled number ICU beds ran 100% capacity months. similar thing happened non-ICU patient beds. triple load healthcare system, end using lot supplies quickly. 0.0014% I‚Äôm 24 hours second Pfizer dose. currently headache arm still bit sore. Woke 2:30 morning soreness wanting little bit heavier blanket. able stand wash dishes (no dishwasher apartment) without major issues morning. 

I got offered job back minor league baseball team, I‚Äôm thinking returning. I‚Äôm thrilled outdoor masking, loved job COVID missed lot last year. It‚Äôs shorter season (60 home games) normal trying hope restrictions relaxed summer goes on. also feel would probably benefit mental health good, consistent reason leave apartment work home feels never ending. Maybe ask get tested?  wider scope legislation sponsored health insurance companies hospital cooperations lobbied let practice wider scope.

That's wider scope. I'm talking FPA. I'm talking ability prescribe, diagnose, treat something NPs across board always done. scope always higher regular nurse, saying they're ""just nurse"" disingenuous misleading. NPs held higher standard nurses. Patients need know that. race covid cases going vertical homegrown vaccine (and possibly imported doses) getting administered fast enough arrest growth. mainly due lack skilled personnel, atleast Germany that‚Äôs main reason pro-restriction public health folks pound table children/people certain health conditions able get vaccinated reason keep place. think work though. point, number people serious risk COVID death/complications unable protect low people really start question cost/benefit sort mass restrictions. brutal lockdown led 75 million slipping back poverty. worse outcome. wait.......wtf correct. Yes, confused leadership country setting example asking start course little longer avoid many deaths possible final hour.

It's like said ""if vaccinated need mask"" people would lie vaccinated... Right? voted Trmp, need proof. That‚Äôs awesome! Even better trials. Agreed.

Do support mask mandates annually flu season? think even simplest measures could help saves lives flu. disinformation. There‚Äôs evidence SA variant efficacy either way either. global perspective. Free trade allows less arbitrary shortages effective manufacturing, meaning doses produced total globally.

India also one main contributors COVAX, meaning doses primarily exporting places badly needing doses well.

From Indian perspective (taking account also far behind US UK vaccinations), yes, wrong choice. global perspective, right choice. possible now. spread joy. encourage people get vaccinated ASAP. Also, hell not? Life difficult is, might well relax bit something good community. That's why. misconception common perfect example media science misconstrued they‚Äôre super careful present studies. day, aunt said friends (in 70s) telling vaccine lasts 6 months regretted getting it.

I saw plenty articles social media saying ‚ÄúStudies found vaccine lasts 6 months‚Äù headlines. add ‚Äúat least‚Äù? even better, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs 6 months studies found vaccines still effective‚Äù. shit like doesn‚Äôt get clicks. \*than 
You ignorant fool. Everyone know bad pretty shitty side effects J&amp;J, without previous covid infection. wanted Pfizer wanted mRNA vaccine Pfizer real world data. first shot uncomfortable. ran slight fever experienced muscle pain. second fatigued, fever muscle pain. pain injection site times, wasn‚Äôt debilitating anything. 30 hours shots felt totally back normal. He's Tamil comedian named Vivek. Although watch Tamil movies anymore, thoroughly enjoyed comedy growing up. lot movies social activist too, encouraging everyone take vaccine even day death. one good ones, RIP. Taken soon 59. really weird see people believe science sub... guess guys everywhere point.. man sucks.   OP probably speaking Vivek Tamil movie industry. died Arterial block day later got vaccine shot. Using running disinformation campaign. 

He good activist. could see would crying death used as. far know dentists legally allowed tell floss anymore scam... man... Lol looked name... STRINGS attached... Funny. That's Kentucky I'm sure we're gonna get there. like keeps us vaccinated beholden anti-vaxx dummies. much hope whole US reasonable number vaccinations, I'm hoping state (PA) surrounding states do. looks like happen, demand still seems high. think discussed all... treatment things question, likely would spoken doctor it. correct. de Blasio state legislators want mandate lifted NYC, emergency power removal make difficult Cuomo block wishes. Also, de Blasio almost always bigger restriction advocate two throughout entire pandemic. Well important point there's difference vaccine rejecters, vaccine hesitant, vaccine apathetic. vaccine rejecters never take it. hesitant untrusting it, still take necessary. apathetic lazy, see point nothing change.

The key target apathetic hesitant. Give people goal work towards, open privileges vaccination (travel, maskless, dining) people get vaccinated. OMT clearly stated purely political decision one based data. OMT opening now, suggest wait now. Also, projection wrong multiple times, optimistic pessimistic. models are, certain. could completely wrong decision, guess government taking.

I understand, clue curfew still doing. 10 pm curfew really stop lot. Understandable compliance high, basically almost one currently urge go times clubs pubs closed anyway.

Also, opening outdoor parts pubs restaurants decrease amount people parks meetings even based on? thing probably ensure amount people parks people terrasjes. people about. specifically bad thing (being outside), people meet indoors less keep following measures outside going places. see happens, gamble.

And higher education understand well. Even though primary schools high schools proven huge corona factories wave, could happen higher education. one day per week measures, mandatory distancing voluntary mass testing (low compliance anyways), maybe keep highly doubt it, high schools basically set measures successful.

Look, let go measures separately completely understand them. measure let go without significant consequences. assuming measure sperate people follow rules. However, case, people always follow measures cannot see measures separately. Everything separately makes look like makes complete sense, everything together still means lot contacts lot movement, thus lot chances spread. fact science subreddit believe actual science horseshit... Oh dunno. Home maybe. 1 70,000 fairly similar UK 1.1 100,000 absurdly high, indeed high numbers Denmark speak volumes much disaster vaccine is. [covaxin 1.1 crore covishield 11.6 crore example country used wealth handle virus well? message needs (and been) get vaccinated, go back normal. case, would make Belgium blow US water. CDC needs declare fully vaccinated individuals drop mask. would encourage many people get otherwise won‚Äôt. already said can‚Äôt carry/spread don‚Äôt get point mask shots. wrong, none variants shown meaningful vaccine evasion. vaccines working extremely well. Good day sir Ontario :D Literally everywhere did. anywhere else put people. first wave brutal lockdown. hundreds thousands people gathering. least Sweden saying spread happens mostly at: work, within families private social gatherings - according contact tracing. think probably pretty common last year. People want inconvenience themselves, spread others. killed 560,000 people. Would taking Prozac make vaccine less effective since acts anti-inflammatory? Similar advil, etc.? wearing mask outside get signal everyone else. Nah use existing inactive viral ingredient.

However time, spread rural urban areas unlike last wave. Mumbai functioning normally March. wave spread rural part Maharashtra entire state spreading entire country.

Side note lockdowns seem disproportionately affect POC. States longer harder lockdowns higher number minority deaths percentage population (Michigan I'm looking you..). think herd immunity plays well. seeing articles everyday least past week so.

My question that's India year, now? come disease spread population already last year like Europe Americas? India's covid deaths peaked 1k level September went (and rising rapidly). 1k course big absolute number, 1.4 billion people tiny. UK 1/20 population higher daily number deaths January that. something add up.

Tendring ladies gentlemen! hard get vaccinated even situation control February March. So, India helped everyone else well. time rest world help India.

Sharing resources ups downs best ways get together. Nationalism export bans cancer making everything worse. health care US top notch.

It's paying/billing part we're criticized current vaccination rate 3 million per day. brings 460 days population 1.38 billion. 1.3 years max. 

Edit: actually scratch 120 million already vaccinated. 420 days.  mean, we're worst, look worse us metric, confidence boosting live work Sams club vaccine. think stall people strong opinions.

Also, note still takes week starts current infections actually week ago (5 days incubation +1-2 report results). every infections higher ed lockdown feel like opening week vroeg unregulated meetings us students locking 12m2 hang ourself loneliness. restictions *terrasjes* feel like mostly crowd park meetings. doubt opening stores like much effect open similar less strict terms smart lockdown. may 1 vaccination open 18.

We see large number ppl getting vaccinated coming months sept oct think 55 percent herd immunity due vaccination plus previous infection.

Still imperative hold masks,sanitizers physical distancing till reach herd immunity.

Another note first wave media said herd immunity reached doctor ever said reached herd immunity. 20 percent ppl antibodies first wave every international arrival? I'd understand US situation New Zealand Australia are, namely low infections inside country, US's infection rate tens thousands per day, make sense quarantine international arrivals. could still make sense quarantine arrive countries worse situation US, India (probably). 

In fact would make sense quarantine parts country infections high restrict travel parts low. would probably effect quarantining international arrivals. UK, almost nobody wears mask outside, think completely fine unless large crowd. spread outdoors minimal. Crazy think even rate take another 997.5 days 2.73 years give everyone else first shot, fully vaccinate everyone India could looking 4 years easily!

Michigan peaked going downward trend, country. gives hope get consistent messaging going forward. point 60 - 70 percent adults fully vaccinated, hoping messaging still ‚Äústay home, wear mask, avoid crowds, etc‚Äù much love headline. ""offer"" it? much ""offer"" nice afternoon waterboarding? ""To protect troops"", lives people held detained without court without hope matter, right? 

Seriously, believe giving choice. did, would surely accept vaccine order protect captors. wonder country going receive shipments... shipments already made facility. EU recognizes one's best interest impose export bans private international companies. complain companies fall behind agreements EU, otherwise understand global nature pandemic. example, EU complaining Pfizer, meeting exceeding contract goals, still exporting millions doses EU plants. 

America country (besides UK, production infinitely lower) decided allow exports. different sharing doses! private companies told can't fulfill contracts nations America. invested companies discovered vaccine. BioNTech German Germany put money vaccine US did. AZ British/Swiss, got money UK US. Janssen Belgian. 

The reason America gets away wealth regulatory clout allows bully. Plain simple. love American, that's fine. is.  I've got severe doubt point 100% reduction severe Covid claims 

And should. going 100% real world, like others. 

I'm sure getting downvoted. Yes, people idiots socially divisive choices self-reinforcing. findings originally published study titled ""The Sneetches"" Sorry, ""pretty much"" eradicate disease. Coronavirus never eradicated. need booster shot 6 months complete first round vaccination. Breakouts come go kind ""herd immunity"" reached. Especially number population refuses get vaxxed remains high. answer likely multifaceted. Climate geography probably big factors. northern mid-west states like Illinois Minnesota getting fairly hard hit too. states better, could got hit weeks later vaccines (and Illinois probably naturally immune people too). 

Other northern dense areas like PA, NJ, NYC still high, got hit harder first several waves immunity. 

Don't try reduce cause single variable. likely many. variables random luck. Gather privately vaccine made for. also thing protects from. made society return normalcy. current data shows risk vaccinated people live pre pandemic lifestyle small. fact CDC wont acknowledge science part using abundance caution leads eroded confidence using honest science based approach. leads skepticism vaccine effects. Spinning truth saying everything prevent deaths may actually increase deaths less people overall vaccinated. Why? second dose reinforce antibodies spike protein, matter spike protein delivered via mRNA adenovirus/DNA? might even better get two different vaccines slight difference spike proteins body react mutations. (Hypothetically, [actual starting IIRC. Except Michigan exact peak cases Indiana fall (same average case numbers)....but Michigan 3 million people. less natural immunity. nice hear someone currently experiencing every vaccine side effect lol. Definitely worth Catching covid, especially UK right now, overwhelming unlikely. 


Because vaccines (AZ used) driven down. think Covid disappeared itself? think *special* worthy taking tiny risk vaccine side effects everyone else help us get mess?  
 
It's selfish attitude, really is. you‚Äôre seeing track trace eyes *your* experience USA. think everywhere attitude tracking tracing, you‚Äôre wrong. Americans don‚Äôt like it, won‚Äôt want going countries. What‚Äôs laughable thinking everywhere like America. Typical, still laughable. Wait, true? thought odds Covid death amongst young low, low. Yes, forgot them! aliens suddenly appear nuke humanity surface Earth. Considering lacking data scenarios, impossible tell likely. I'm worried too... Herd immunity take hold we're top sigmoid function gets worse exponentially fast even cutoff herd immunity starts.

I think need like 85% covid herd immunity starts. Also fall 85% get worse FAST again.

Obviously hope I'm wrong. Bad comparison.

The chance getting struck lightning less static number based years data.

The % vaccinated people got covid continue increase. stat snapshot time. Hell yeah, thank you. start trying that! fuck talking lol? It‚Äôs immune mediated thrombocytopenia, ‚Äúblood disease‚Äù. I‚Äôm sorry medical school go again? treat it, read article you‚Äôll find 12 people got died, it‚Äôs like even kills every one gets it. think 1st one worse lot people Covid article dated 3/12 today 4/21. awesome downvoted bringing actual math discussion. 

I‚Äôm talking MIchigan RIGHT NOW. That‚Äôs question - Michigan spiking?

My point comment replying invalid logic. historic cases per capita similar MI big states. good news cases clearly peaked. What‚Äôs amazing also reflected US cases, downward trend. hilarious once-scary, never tried ""DNA vaccine"" Moderna/Pfizer super safe refuge vaccine scaredy cats, vaccines using older, tested technology avoided costs. ok efficacy severe Covid-19 disease 100% 

Which likely means issue trial really high. Ah. Try WalMart scheduling midnight. make first appointment. need realize variants concern thing nothing person said irrational. also effect keeps people can't get vaccinated safe.

Educate yourself. Frustrating is, phrase ""follow data"" means policy always cautious end lag couple weeks behind many people would like.

Friend mine India, dad (in India) two shots vaccine still got symptomatic covid. dad's coworker who'd also two shots hospital. Apparently variant strain. It‚Äôs crazy simple yet it‚Äôs rarely stated. Hopefully CDC starts saying soon.

They experts infectious diseases, human behavior. expect continue avoid topic state local governments straight ignore them. it‚Äôs like people *only* ever seeing people wearing masks. home, vaccinated people, people pod, people outdoors, hell, even TV, kids adults presented unmasked people majority time. going Walmart time see people psychological issues well beyond masking. curve cases + positivity rate Michigan begs differ? Covishield covaxin see, things get worse within 29 days. Well upper limit observed sample size, knows disease evolves lot people gets serious months? Also 59 cases vaccineted before/earlie April, 4.2 million jabs reference mid april total vaccinations. totally misleading calculate risk based numbers. People would rather ignore examples cited directly address them. That's probably symptoms thrombosis listed side effects vaccine (feeling coldness headaches).

I got vaccine days thrombosis reported exact side effects honest, known see doctor that.

But aware symptoms thrombosis know take seriously go doctor. I‚Äôve using paper towel open bathroom doors years know least 50% people aren‚Äôt washing hands use bathroom. I‚Äôm putting clean hands handle know two posts incorrect risk assessment. Take look [this UK's Winston Center Risk Evidence Communication. folks age 20-29 bracket, risk calculus getting AZ vaccine waiting different vaccine clear cut. low-risk, expect wait significantly less 16 weeks, waiting might even safer option.

You make argument level risk worth fretting about, think argument still little murky. risk dying AZ vaccine seems order 3 micromorts so. Possibly 2-3x risk concentrated certain age groups. England, average person's risk dying ""non-natural causes"" [a bit 1 micromort per 300 year. So, year get AZ shot, increase total yearly risk death ""non-natural causes"" around 1-3%. That's small, negligible - sort risk take there's good reason take it. country case rates high vaccinations low, think that's good reason take it. young person country high vaccination rates, low case rates, supply vaccines, might reasonable wait weeks. Crossover planned - trial crossover explained back January. believe plan start crossover they‚Äôre almost ready send data FDA I‚Äôd expect announcement soon. pandemic me. Michigan even begun peak, peaks Philadelphia gunna feel it. nothing considerate anti-science. add fuel fire anti-maskers things like would need see number men vs women actually received vaccine. reason younger age bracket mostly healthcare workers did, tend skew female. 5000 people 77 million people gotten infection people mild infections. Also, according logic, JJ redirect vaccines EU, since US blocked two weeks.

This 5th grader‚Äôs logic. AZ (if approach) dumb case mentioned entire school shut quarantine like ""nah. get tested, I'm gonna go see TON family."" think basically said ‚Äî three choices: make people get vaccines, implement way check vaccine status, mask little longer everyone eligible. People still stubborn get vaccines numbers necessary, people screeching vaccine passports, option left mask slightly longer. troll. totally missed point high PR tend react attempts persuasion hostility counter-arguments, believing defending freedom.

Regardless whether believe ""anti-maskers"" wrong, *they* believe right attempt persuade wrong simply reinforces belief rights infringed.

The question raised article ""how convince people refuse convinced?"".

What work. dumb pointless article lol...do expect people look past headlines anymore? difference vaccinating 18-year-old American brat can't arsed wear mask another month wants party 60-year-old underlying health conditions another part world risking life going work support family.

You're completely understanding situation India right now. reason bad exactly they've mentioned first part sentence. COVID theater demonstrates lack understanding science especially recent studies show vaccinated people don‚Äôt spread virus.

Its small studies announcement CDC.

Nothing change CDC say OK drop masks. add bingo... Also, think considering seeing people's faces affects humans psychologically developmentally children. face important communication literally part brain devoted recognizing interpreting faces. 

There harm mask wearing, height pandemic harm far outweighed benefits wearing masks preventing Mass death. mass death stopped, need stop wearing masks. There's also big chunk people *excited* get (like sub) *willing* get it, overly convenient them. Basically readily available exact location usually get prescriptions filled, walk-in basis, hour day week, happen rush get home work (and remember it). 

If heard mad dash appointments March, went lives really looking May going ""Oh wow, May already?"" realizing dash pretty much over. might check pharmacy see what's up. Hopefully! Yep. E484K E484Q mutations. Nothing new. Carry far I‚Äôve heard state (NC) free public options two statewide virtual charter schools, significant waiting list. think presence list suggests state probably open third. CVST pretty treatable caught early, I'd imagine everyone receiving adenovirus vaccine told report A&amp;E develop persistent heading lasting 24-48hrs.

Also they're avoiding demographics CVST common cases occur probably less severe. Yeah, day got first dose (about week ago) day started letting people come mass-vax site without appointment. one hand widening availability cool since lot people volatile schedules able keep set appointment, kind worrying sign demand appointments filling available doses entirely. 

In places administered lot shots compared elsewhere seems like things already starting top out, way hope things top out. Even so: Germany 59 cases 4.2 million doses given. 

Janssen 8 cases 7 million shots, translating 1 875k. AZ would roughly 1 70k. That's huge difference, especially consider US vaccinating much diverse age group Germans are. said EU halted use AZ. didn‚Äôt.

Five six countries 27 did.

Also, main issue UE whole AZ don‚Äôt get enough orders. happening turned AZ causes clotting issues. situations children must brought places ‚Äî inadequate childcare one. also ‚Äî children deserve sequestered homes tiniest inconvenience others could mean participate society. also two shot? (Covaxin)

I friends got two shot there, sure one got rofl yep, tobacco utterly disgusting Florida (assuming Texas).

I see less maskers suburbs last weeks whole lot. Sayonara Olympics üò• reason would fully vaccinated adults continue wear masks? point essentially enforcement mass policies problematic people fake vaccine card etc

I think make good argument kids schools continue wear masks get vaccinated, we're honest vaccinated people continuing wear masks asymptomatic basically virtue signaling point.

Again I'm saying asymptomatic vaccinated person. reason person wear mask social pressure. stop propagating lie vaccines prevent severe covid 100% efficacy?

None trials enough positive cases make claim, observational studies Isreal US Pfizer vaccine show hospitalization death rates among get COVID vaccinated similar get COVID vaccinated. factor ~15 reduction getting COVID great reason get vaccine, vaccinated immune death, dangerous say so. going everyone never get vaccine wearing masks it‚Äôs hard enforce.

We've learned CDC great hard science absolute shit managing/encouraging human behavior. 

They super concerned early mask hoarding, told people wear saw ended opening anti-maskers make political.

There going subset lie sure, feeling going small percentage. bigger problem continue push vaccines = still need wear mask, social distance, going get lot apathetic non-vaccinated people see point getting shots especially virus danger themselves.

If simply health policy concern, CDC would absolutely correct continue encouraging wearing masks lot factors play beyond simply health policy, societal, economic, political consequences factored frankly CDC good stuff. really? CDC says Federal government distributed 272 mln vaccines states/wherever deliver to, 260 mln number listed article.

Unless you‚Äôre using number 260 mln listed article? actually like ""irrelephant"", misspell attempt use conversation. like new way referring elephant room... confidence intervals wide could anything 0% 55% based 2000 people handful infections. really work, surely places vaccinate heavily AZ like UK start seeing large uptick SA variant cases now, they? Oh also, white house also issued guidelines states says 14 days decreasing numbers lossen restrictions... metricy enough? seem saying government can't tell license date, government can't tell license drive virtual schools operate many states child living state attend free charge instead local school. parent would around support kid, kid would teacher video chat would lessons would done computer. Israel also enforcing vaccine passports, makes easier declare victory.

No vaccine passport? Ya staying home... WV WV vaccines crawling halt, according WV Department health website vaccines slowing,

March 26th 16,826 first doses, state vaccinated 687,045 first doses, people getting now, every since governor opened everything up, Monday removed masks mandates, people assume covid get back it, state seeing average 400 cases day last 14 days, 1 county WV health officials contacted 15,000 people telling vaccine ready 15 people made appointments. well, would rather die smoking weed

Here‚Äôs don‚Äôt get though. mean started one person China. spread little bit seems pretty much inevitable going reach practically every part globe capacity. Immunity, whether it‚Äôs past infection vaccine, may last long time, won‚Äôt last forever. top that, good chunk population never going consent vaccine. In, say, 10 years, less half population immune, wouldn‚Äôt 4 infections turn 10, 50, 10,000? don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd really believe said people going disciplined getting regular booster shots.

I genuinely don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm talking about. I‚Äôm saying expect events play way, don‚Äôt understand wouldn‚Äôt, someone help please. read data, AZ shit. German, source article 'Bild' exceptionally bad journalism. well known misinformation fear mongering. Please take credible source information. know, that's ridiculously **bad**. main number probably want look preventing hospitalizations/severe cases. think main vaccines pretty much prevent severe cases. Indiana's 7 day individual positivity rate 13.6% today rise Well pumping vaccines kinda India here‚Äôs hoping!  Agreed think happen sooner rather later. already happening rural areas much South.

We'll position could theoretically give shots large cities couple weeks (if added supersites, etc.), even unlikely last long.

By time May, average suburban Walgreens going able fill slots. don‚Äôt understand. you‚Äôre vaccinated still masked silly paranoid. point still masked pandering refuse vaccine they‚Äôre crazy antivaxxers something. chances still able transmit virus fully vaccinated low none. say fully vaccinated individual meets another fully vacinated individual.

Which, main benefit masks/distancing protecting general people know (e.g. public transport, shopping etc), change times people would actually wearing mask socially distancing. Everyone forgets earlier year forced guy fixing subway crisis funnel money cronies without oversight. guess you‚Äôre right? I‚Äôve read article German University explained detail handle AZ blood clots auto immune reaction closely resembles comparably common side effect heparin, blood thinner. 

I‚Äòm sure treatment makes less lethal though (like eg. official late stage rabies treatment, 0% success rate).  [EU/EEA product information AZ (p. address manufacturer(s) biological active substance   Maryland, Inc  Harmans Road  MD21077  States got J&amp;J too. least virtually guarantee get serious illness huge imho. Also, many people seem asymptomatic J&amp;J vaccines really, that's really good too. Although sounds really hard quantify.

I'm sure need get booster something later on, we'll get word it. 12 months TV experts making claims proven ridiculous months later, think everything massive grain salt. plain couple obvious ones, year ago everybody proclaimed reason coronavirus cases high New York high population concentration, wins award highest case counts Covid now? North South Dakota!

Two months ago everybody reclaiming reason case counts low India young also exposed kinds germs head natural immunity, two months later? Cases freaking roof! real logic work people say things like that. pure emotional fear coupled boatload misinformation.

I know someone willing get vaccine ended getting covid. realized bad symptoms really (not ""just flu"") even sick enough need hospitalization, willing take antibody therapy available. took actually getting virus become real them. get argument, really do‚Äî- sitting 20 million AZ vaccines aren‚Äôt using? ship out? 

Why isn‚Äôt WH administration working developing plan ship vaccines hit threshold? won‚Äôt tell us threshold is? No, good. 70% time get infection. would interesting find men hormones transition. would explain anomalies. Eight billion Petri dishes. successful ones get try again. Intellectual property nothing really it. India vaccine, could force release said IP divert funds towards it... isn‚Äôt. there‚Äôs little reason letting Moderna J&amp;J vaccine let go would increase vaccine flow. would let companies profit it, make mistakes increase vaccine hesitancy. Texas's mask mandate one weakest country relied businesses enforcement begin with. Businesses generally chose continue enforcing even mandate lifted.  Well. F‚Äôd Pfizer shot 2. fever, bad headache couldn‚Äôt stay awake. Started 12 hours got it. Ended 12 hours started. got this! second shot absolutely painless first felt like I'd mashed shoulder cinder block. strange. Mandatory vaccination quite common here. child (and baby) go set mandatory shots want able go kindergarten, school etc. 

The problem covid mandatory vaccination new quite people don‚Äôt trust vaccines safe. 

If covid stays around, could see years would become mandatory part shots get kid, hope don‚Äôt try force soon. biggest issue morons won‚Äôt get vaccinated. convince take absurd losing even credibility treating vaccinated people like received shot saline? Good. People chance get vaccinated then. people want wear masks feel better themselves, that. Could worse. could Cuomo. take EU 6-9 months vaccinate enough people relevant, lines Share take care own? way stop acting like should. Cases low summer, though, evened out. Yeah, thought too. mean, get flu shot every year, difference make get Covid shot too?

For matter, mRNA vaccine makers getting flu shot business. 2-3 years might getting annual ""respiratory virus booster"" cover both. collapsing variants developed. Covid fine variants began ravaging countries people really want wear masks already wearing them. Depends goal though. deaths - absolutely elderly first. overall spread, would argue younger first. 

But I'm statistician. waited turn patiently number called. everyone's predictions businesses drop masks restrictions? Places like Target, grocery stores, Starbucks allowing people sit inside again, etc. drop states drop restrictions? Even states mask mandate places still require masks, even enforced. Honestly go fuck themselves. I'm sorry. Even rural people go church/restaurants/grocery stores/work/bars. Tbh it‚Äôs major problem. US needs start sharing vaccines, variant worse India Brazil‚Äôs gonna set us back. Tell amazingly powerful conspiracy could pull off, he‚Äôs flea back rat titanic thinking kind say reaching Tahiti. downvoted lol literally doesn‚Äôt happen. Read article past year warning consequences intellectual property vaccine. There‚Äôs reason happen greed. Get head ass. Don‚Äôt forget 0.03% mortality rate coronavirus itself! 2 days im 2 weeks second shot. I‚Äôm pumped. live tourist town it‚Äôs finally back couldn‚Äôt come better time  demographics people getting blood clots? bubonic plague pandemic ended, took 400 years. Ok gave away since still sitting tens millions reason. No. different vaccine make initial trials made people *test* positive HIV, give HIV. caused false positive HIV tests essentially. Development vaccine stopped early. think makes sense sides. EU negotiating deal ASAP. Therefore focussing companies delivered promises, far biontech Pfizer (and hopefully CureVac) (Moderna also delivering don‚Äôt know deal there). 

On hand urgency makes sense individual countries negotiate different vaccines want to. 

While I‚Äôm mRNA, hope keep traditional vaccines market people confident new tech. merrier. 

Also I‚Äôm interested seeing progress regavac (I think that‚Äôs name) based yellow fever vaccines bring research Leuven. apparently could game changer third world could transported frigo box, expect life time efficiency understood. Oh would also work yellow fever double win. rarely seen jerk! understanding asked reimbursed way get around contract law. think would liability issues flat gave vaccines countries. person replying to, I‚Äôm someone teaches wears mask 40+ hours week think adults whine masks acting like toddlers. Don‚Äôt assume everyone wears one long time agrees you. Oof. 

I hope eventually convince him.   TIL? health host replicative drift?? Yeah, fact it‚Äôs something uneducated morons believe telling. You‚Äôre prime example dunning kruger effect. Technically there's guarantee fair, India stopped exports well. People vax cards. Carry around, like driver's license.

Show card entering gated, crowded, public spaces, like theaters, concerts, public transportation, ball games, etc. except unattended entryways (e.g. subways).  Otherwise wear mask.

For air travel require either 2 shots + 2 weeks, recent test + mask. Sounds like pandemics end too

Nah jokes aside covid never going end human species Good news picked better image? Kinda cringey wearing mask right. Ah shit, go Indiana much higher moment. Thank goodness. 17 year old son tested positive yesterday. Last week first full week person classes. father fully vaccinated crossing fingers. reference I‚Äôm 33 years old slightly overweight. constant fever 99-100, chills off, back pain 3 days. lost smell days luckily got back recovered. cough minor, felt like scratchy throat, chest felt heavy like get mucus avail. Also constantly tired 24/7 tried best get walk around times every day heard it‚Äôs good lungs. recovered 10 days got wind back full 2 weeks. also went entire case water, think constant fever makes dehydrated. 100% marketing thing say effective specific variant, pity textile looks interesting, need insult intelligence. EU delivered 100 million doses EU Q1 deliver well 400 million Q2. That's 100 million doses delivered EU first half year. Considering EU exports around 50%, actually deliver well 1 billion doses first 6 months 2021. Deliveries production, production even higher. many US planning produce first 6 months year excluding everything 2020?

Add 750 million deliveries EU Q3 600 million deliveries Q4. That's around 1.35 billion deliveries EU second half 2021. Considering 50% export, probably around 2.7 billion deliveries EU last 6 months year. almost 4 billion vaccine deliveries 2021. exported, EU needs around 800-900 million doses (considering everyone wants vaccine including minors). Breton recently said expects produce around 3 billion doses EU 2021. 

So pushing vaccines like ""space race"". Maybe China able produce match figures. big difference US supply supplying 330 million citizens, EU supply supplying 450 citizens + billions citizens outside EU speak. ...And? mean overkill.  That‚Äôs point. 

Japan isn‚Äôt getting doses ordered Pfizer last year, supposed start getting coming weeks. South Korea, Australia, New Zealand similar situations. Yes, this. it‚Äôs harmless. It‚Äôs called ‚Äúcovid arm‚Äù. ""Stop trying make others same"" this. push lockdowns gets ridiculous can't anymore . history many people sacrificing nothing won‚Äôt exactly change it.

Ridiculous amounts plastic chemical pollution two reasons. big picture. Pandemic date, fared better average statistically US, despite closing economy like states. success buddy. bought, expect delivery. see begging this. like this: buy something someone expect receive tomorrow. receive it, person buying decided keep decides give things later agreed upon. Theft basically. US buyers EU buyer. bit nuance here, US government deciding steal bought supplies, suppliers directly. 

And something else, implies EU capable producing things themselves. probably true. lot vaccine critical supply production EU. probably CureVac decided buy US, made sense business wise (e.g. cheaper). getting it, must sourced EU instead.

This also implies US need supplies China/Europe. know case, Europe China let private companies produce deliver whoever bought them, instead taking production c mmu nists. US companies complain supply Europe China, getting it.

Everyone preferably dependent other, makes things cheaper. happen trust. two way street. US broken trust made one way street (critical supplies in, nothing out). everyone knows never ever get anything important/critical US cannot trusted. bad all. already seeing EU. Previously mind getting critical supplies US vaccine contracts made, trusted US even though domestic production. 

The trust completely gone, thus EU wants critical materials vaccine production sourced within EU future contracts. already see Janssen, supposed filled finished US. moved EU. even new BioNTech contract 1.8 billion doses critical supplies must sourced within EU now. Previously first step BioNTech vaccine happened US (DNA plasmid production) could done EU well.

Two three variants triple mutation seen immune escape responses, meaning resistant antibodies. much known yet effectiveness vaccines. Scientists believe new variant ability escape body's naturally acquired immunity Covid.

Fuck yeah it‚Äôs started warm pnw last week so, think we‚Äôll start see case reduction reflecting surge vaccinations next week two sound like jerk, think we're measuring owes what, US vast amount credit South Korea generally... That's pretty pessimistic. pandemic advanced infectious disease research way that's like 2 decades advancement pre-pandemic research year. looking pretty certain virtually infectious disease immune system capable mounting effective response make even effective vaccine immunity induced natural infection.

Yes, HIV, tuberculosis, malaria still remain challenge even long time challenges see benefit scientific advances made now.

Overseas travel heavily restricted moderated last year, may delayed onset second wave here. like another person replied, since January everything opened country forgot pandemic. Half people stopped wearing masks, majority wore would show, like covering neck.

The vaccination drive incredibly slow, government bothered exporting vaccines PR, rather vaccinating citizens. govt arrogant allow non-India developed vaccines imported , days back situation dawned them.

South korea still low corona virus infection rate. that's totally different story gaining full immunity vaccine, dumdum. Let‚Äôs openly challenge nature again, please. That's bummer. live super red area half people believe masks probably vaccinate, they're already taking sign ups virtual school 2021-2022 school year. keep pharmacy accounts getting vaccine? lot pharmacies required registering accounts get vaccine.  think people expected huge problem there, last year, reason, wasn't. entitlement dripping comment. fully expect see little darlings posting r/RaisedByNarcissists time now. Oh yeah, first batch doses. never said ordered zero. chart linked clearly shows orders hundreds millions.

May lucky. wonder Florida deaths begin decrease, feels like stagnant month course looking strictly individual level. benefits vaccination go far beyond protection individual. 


Of course agree benefits need outweigh risk, I'm suggesting many cases people hearing risks far overweighting risk ultra rare side effect compared usually would, calculating risk benefit calculation correctly. 


Many people even think twice risk dying bloodclot whilst taking birth control (because tiny) yet media concerned ultra rare risk dying blood clot due AZ despite risk even smaller, putting numbers context. Yea countries like Canada limited supply first dose strategy makes sense. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs really applicable U.S isn‚Äôt significant supply shortages. vaccine development first started project ""Warp Speed"" felt way waiting wild pretty good long time. I've kept vaccine news trying understand every aspect going vaccines, become much comfortable it. Especially mRNA technology. I'm scheduled 2nd Moderna jab tomorrow. Production vaccine linear - producers get experienced yields materials get quicker - shown UK's supply 20 million? come comment says it‚Äôs 4.2 million? Yes right. India situation dire outside family forums groups countless 50+ vaccinated people getting severe disease.

The ability virus mutate much scares me. Vaccines need constant tweaking continues Ok im india question.

It‚Äôs foolish point make. could easily become something doesn‚Äôt go away don‚Äôt make go away. Wishing away ‚Äúpandemics end‚Äù won‚Äôt work. think referring immediate hospitalization Covid symptoms vs hospitalization effects Covid body. in, hospitalized ventilation typical Covid issues, months later stiffening heart lead heart disease required hospitalization kidney failure led hospitalization, etc. 

My sister nurse Trauma 1 hospital seeing lot people Covid months ago permanent heart lung kidney damage Covid hospital Covid (and Covid positive) damage Covid organs. 

So wonder vaccine works keeping Covid majorly affecting organs long term Accodring state Florida persons age 18 elligble recive vaccine 5th April. supplies limited, limited enough warrent giving people full benefits. moving break neck speed might agree partial coverage, running problem people wanting it. Florida problem problem non less. think they're contradicting themselves. Sure vaccine confer 100% protection that's risk covid cases exploding around you. However perfectly suitable situation large portion population vaccinated, end goal anyway. clicks go? article UK today saying variant that's blamed debacle around quite time seen countries early last October. mostly excuse government one blames lack effective policy outbreak. restrictions protect \*those\* morons, people vaccine take (its 95% effective, 100%), kids can't yet take etc

Not sure restrictions would still make sense vaccination risk levels, think 'no restrictions' right answer right now. Cases dropping removed one thing helped drop, seriously bad republican educated politician. 

Damn even hard thing do, cry forced lockfown losing thousands lives every week Well humans faced plenty pandemics 200,000 years. far, ended. I've pretty strong side effects well. thought better 1 day guaranteed recovery 14 days possible effects rest life. already largely happened area cases keep dropping here. Third post I‚Äôve seen study week. doomsday variant narrative getting old. virus doesn‚Äôt seem learning new tricks markers.  Unless UP, would expect able find next day appointment within 50 mile drive matter live Michigan. UP, might 100 miles.

Use one vaccine spotter websites. There's tons available appointments Michigan right now. Theoretically it‚Äôs closed.

Good news. 80k friday concerning surprised see cases fall days after. wonder time hold 50k day hopefully make progress go lower that. Last time surged back 70-80k pretty quickly.  cases exploding Kumbh Mela though cases stemming likely start showing around now. going pretty.

However look epi curve report see cases declined tremendously vaccinations began nursing homes great! Really? Name one. solution pay people get vaccinated. essentially three groups vaccine holdouts - completely getting vaccinated due brainwashing/propaganda, people fence/sort getting vaccinated due brainwashing/propaganda, merely indifferent lazy.

I‚Äôm starting realize I‚Äôve using venting space get validation myself, ask legitimate questions virus, could productive things time. Paywall source numbers no. Solid article. Here's another similar conclusions, bit sciencey. nice.   term restrictions

It depends restrictions, things like hard lockdowns definitely feasible. mask mandates hospitals doctor's offices? That's feasible. Fair enough, first country LatAm produce covid-19 vaccine. didn‚Äôt care flu airborne illnesses. makes COVID different people vaccinated?

If concerns much, you‚Äôre free wear mask. fairly significant nausea J&amp;J, starting 30 minutes shot ending six hours later. drive NYC? it! Sounds like coworker better negotiator you. Republican leaders definitely emphasizing fact. It‚Äôs half country returned normal. knew stoping Covid without vaccine willing stop lives forever long took virus .7 ifr.  First country Latin America produce Sputnik. worried reason could Googled ... Yes, know, produced Brazil. Sputnik Russian would produced Argentina. Also heard Argentina producing components AstraZeneca vaccine one point time. THANK YOU! I‚Äôm even vaccine 100% safe efficacy bad compared others, never using except people could make two appointments.

Additionally, HAPPENED SOMEONE TRIAL. 25 YEAR OLD MAN PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. trial 35,000 experimental group! 29 DAYS shot. 

This 1/1,000,000 incident. J&amp;J knew possible side effect vaccine.

I‚Äôm antivax, got Moderna, people still pushing J&amp;J mess minds. I‚Äôm sorry, mother died J&amp;J vaccine would heart filled vengeance. single person die vaccine. agree good idea, lot workplaces forcing people jump once, absolutely thought care exact situation (REA) gene sequencing strain circulating New York New England initial outbreak literally Italian strain. Anyways country going ban citizen entering, agree travel ban doesn‚Äôt work. friends moved California Florida wanna wear masks outside we‚Äôre vaccinated back Florida like wtf madness Sinovac Chinese. Best luck mate. shitty year(s) across entire planet should. piece cloth, save lives. cares they're permanent? That's good. fragile can't wear fabric face? must've renewed 15 seasons EU producing anything American/British companies factories Europe. Yes know biontech German. 

Leadership government programs like warp speed China doing. read EU mobilize anything let private companies thing. anything EU warp speed program?

Chinas government communist magic retooled lots factories produce medical stuff. EU debating leadership government. live EU experienced confusion bureaucracy firsthand. can't think anything specific EU politician done fix production issues.  Typically, people who've covid noticeable side effects vaccines. Especially first shot, people covid often feel little for. feel it, likelihood. worth, second dose went way easier first. definitely hard say may happen, second dose effects went away fast still expecting something happen weeks later. arm extremely sore first dose. lasted 4 days. second dose, arm less day. Maybe 18 hours so. Nothing else. expecting least fever extremely tired, arm pain. Bump Wow first dose shots cratered... know Pfizer/Moderna listed common side-effect J&amp;J, overnight first night, bad enough wake couple times. vaccines anything related it. global supply chain disrupted even tiny components like plastic tubes can't exported US. Huge issue, harmful countries' manufacturing.

You can't talk here... I'm surprised they're still receiving them. Latin American first? Brazil already producing Sinovac's got wrong? Nah, cus dumbasses would welded homes. wonderful news. :) I'm hoping schools continue follow route. Probably stress induced It‚Äôs much contagious deadlier *right now*. Widespread vaccine deployment reduce infection mortality rates. vaccines we‚Äôre using US 100% effective preventing deaths trials, example.

Again, COVID mortality reaches flulike rates, don‚Äôt see restrictions continuing. think micro scale better chance working Victoria, Australia good example macro scale doable, least sustainable future. Especially goal zero covid. Yes.

The decrease maybe 70-80% due J&amp;J peaked sure. still high rate injected room temperature stay temp hours injection. Wouldnt operating permits insanely expensive? anyone like stomach pains side effect? got second shot stomach pains right ‚ÄúThe worse it‚Äôs ever been‚Äù quit lying Younger groups able get vaccinated seniors mostly vaccinated, right? so, they'll wait two freaking years turn. That's insane. needed distance people anyhow (chemotherapy), braced appalled dealt ""there's law, do?"", ""He's good guy"" ""I breathing problem"" bullshit.

I still know I'm going deal humans full time again. really miss, others think I'm going zero tolerance bullshit them. even get past initial ""I'm wearing mask because..."" then. easily prejudice group people. Ivy League. us get right back old routines without issue, others going need take time, maybe even require therapy/medication set aside anxiety they've living last year.

So long don‚Äôt expect wait go back life comfortable going back theirs, I‚Äôm happy whatever personally want do. Oh. Unfortunately 14 lab tests Sputnik Slovakia good. 
After detail questioning pharma regulator mean same, long hesitancy avoiding answer confirmed difference packaging - 2doses Slovakia 5 doses vial Lancet.
Technically strictly formally true, political background regulator issued political science statement. US hit peak already? Seems like decrease cant explained lack J&amp;J shots get night, turn vampire !! We‚Äôre third vaccinated country G7

Or G20 want go Hospitalizations seem going recently. Fortunately cases deaths still decreasing. Says one using bunch tiny nations people could never find map? terms actual doses Canada 3rd among G20 nations. Behind US UK. Tied Spain considering less half days difference us. FLU. Stop comparing flu. 1000x contagious 100x deadlier. Maybe find source Michigan's restrictions, couldn't. furthest date recent changes far-too-long extension prohibiting office work, 2021 thing friends social media criticizing media

I trying suggest probably listen people.

Pfizer readying booster shots case they're needed. panic variants coming clickbait sources; every major news outlet repeat every new variant find ""has health experts concerned immune system evasion"" ""so far appear reduce effectiveness vaccines."" want technical explanation that's likely continue, check [this  conflating who‚Äôve lost who‚Äôve done nothing? Maybe US, tell know lot Antivaxx Stoners France... sure term used politics, term ""memory-holing"" would pretty accurate case. Ranch Dubois? need fat blunt! stating ‚Äúintent‚Äù isn‚Äôt removing outcomes actions. It‚Äôs like people die car accidents didn‚Äôt wear seatbelts. Avoidable. Thousands people die every year flu never cared enough society enact restrictions, though. think COVID reaches flulike mortality rates, things back normal. Canada literally going 2nd fastest pace G20 right 

Lol kind weird cherry picked statistic this? important number doses administered per capita, Canada currently 38th place. glad!  He‚Äôd stated intent make money rather make sure it‚Äôs made correctly - see AstraZeneca messing J&amp;J doses recently. It‚Äôs perfect could better black white make seem people looser were. I‚Äôm surprised ppl really think this. they're like vaccinated (planning going myself). 

This might shock people r/coronavirus vaccinated people going back normal lives slowly surely. ""A survey 2,600 industry professionals Union Oenologists showed among caught COVID-19, third said disease affected ability work."" news ~~can't~~ cover ~~the whole country~~ news makes Modi look bad.   [Babies dying Yes, pesky .008%. thought high efficacy preventing getting all? big issue going finding way replace staff would refuse get vaccinated.

I find overlap people *say* ""I'd rather fired get COVID19 vaccine"" would actually stick paycheck actually risk actually pretty small. prevent getting virus, lessens chance severe reactions far understand people American want hear may realizing giving incentive ""okay, get shots p\*\*s back pre-covid behavior"" take combat vaccine hesitancy.

An unschooled truck driver could told geniuses CDC that. much talking heads CDC paid realize now? Actual death rate least, repeat, least 3 times currently reported 2k/day. despite you‚Äôd like believe, vast majority people stupid, selfish pieces shit. pf entities even slightest bit backing cautions warning, we‚Äôd dire situation terms third wave.  I'll pile mention one thing holds promise...

The fact (it *looks* like) variants underwent efficiency mutations independently (example E848K), different parts world, would indicate ""dictionary possible new tricks"" smaller might been.

I suspect EU they've seen warning signs vaccine hesitancy US want nip bud providing clear incentive people get shot. That's unreasonable. even reasonable seems like they're focusing private gatherings, public spaces (where people definitely still masking least set example).

Right, exactly doctor‚Äôs office inappropriate venue focus new vaccination campaign never documented super-spreading event people masked distanced. impossible transmission happen there, unlikely. vaccine manufacturers need 6 months data apply full approval.

What's current consensus natural immunity, anyway? Feel like article fails address that. One question you. correct: viruses (including one causes common cold, including covid virus), contain mRNA makes way person's cells, mRNA instructions tell cell produce viruses sent back outside cell? We‚Äôre third vaccinated country G7 vaccinating faster U.K. even past week two.  I‚Äôm
Happy US getting vaccinated fast finally getting handle case numbers isn‚Äôt seeing huge uptick cases.  smug articles American media telling us Canadians jealous though, could go without.  We‚Äôre getting there. Yup. ""Gifting services"" popping NY. ""Buy sugar cookies 50 bucks get eighth fun free "" hilariously cheap compared many places US like California (where lot Canadians). 

Yeah thing ... guess why? Cause said worth pay much home pay less place California make LOT more. That's pretty damn cool true. understand, want make clear don‚Äôt need everyone eligible remove restrictions. mailed? Yep, last week I‚Äôm pretty sure have. Canada fair study issue. US seems everyone's looking way avoid hurting airline industry. None facilities built 2020.  Want start pissing contest lol. Take Metro Vancouver. said expensive city North America. guess is? Canada ... obviously salaries FAR lower would get Silicon Valley. That‚Äôs accurate conclusion. Remember whole land doesn‚Äôt vote thing? thing here. Land doesn‚Äôt get coronavirus. places don‚Äôt need doses, it‚Äôs good selfish hogging doses exasperated, Canadian government allowing us lose sovereignty build vaccines act fast enough get back. 

The US anybody else owes us nothing. high tech country allowed get predicament. certain time stop smoking getting vaccine? fine. I'm sure fine. That's great approach. 20% hike. Everything fine. FINE!!! bedbugs, anxiety low risk activities exactly them? People seeing you? follow CDC guidelines: get average joe somewhere keep pretending data, PhD, deep understanding immunology scientists doctors work CDC NIAID. data update recommendations, risk health family's health.  getting long way ELI5. Viruses store genetic information different ways, actually classify based genomes look like: called [Baltimare classification 7 different groups. details always complicated, yes, one groups stores genomic information something pretty much mRNA. 

'mRNA' specific way storing genetic information. (human) cells used temporarily carry genetic information genome (DNA) parts cell produce proteins. carries 'message', hence 'messenger RNA' short 'mRNA'. 

Some viruses contain DNA (that would group I), get cell behaves like genome - DNA read, mRNA produced sent carry information protein make. viruses bypass step, already contain genetic information looks pretty much like mRNA. would 'Group IV: positive sense single-stranded RNA viruses' link above. Funnily enough, includes coronaviruses. yes, cell hijacked made viruses, leave cell spread around. 

One last addition: vaccine mRNA contains small part coronavirus genome (the information make spike protein), whole thing. absolutely impossible mRNA vaccination lead virus production. even Jeff Goldblum's level optimism/pessimism ('life finds way'). cases. testing like crazy florida isn't. Deaths hospitalizations matter. pretty much per capita florida. 

If lockdowns worked California worst country extremely locked month? eat outside LA worst country. Something like 1 3 people LA got covid. till medical staff elderly vaccinated dropped majorily worst country. Guess disagree, sure looks like vaccinations infections huge portion CA drove cases down. ""Stopping"" virus slowing down. Slow R0 &lt; 1, wait case numbers drop. way truly ""stop"" viruses tracks problem. coworker female. guy tried ‚Äúanxiety, WFH‚Äù excuse they‚Äôd fired. MediCal insurance poor California great. cheap People talking herpes, ""strains"" instead variants,

Ironically, time people say variants mean strains. Experts bullied everyone enough using term strains knew strains they're afraid use all.

No joke would probably work better anything else half state. Yes. lasted 2 days me. reasons favor date : 

1. definite dependent general public


2. Let's people know clock ticking getting vaccine. Might motivate get sooner. still wearing masks? obviously causes ton unrest public. Canada become US state get extra doses ;) Also, research shows getting vaccinated covid gives extremely high levels immunity. dunno, living disability, MediCal realy damn good Many world's industrialized countries predictably added US 'do travel' advisories many months ago. date. vaccination level. ""Everybody else protected, get sick unvaccinated point that's damn fault"" necessarily politics every case. lot people I've spoken genuinely afraid vaccine media's coverage horror stories circulated them. Blood clots, anaphylaxis, swelling arm, flu symptoms. enough information available vaccines yet alleviate fears completely. lot people seem irrational fear government actually trying kill people thin population. Despite attempts point idiotic sounds, hold firmly belief government lying everything trusted. Despite evidence previous vaccines well worked eliminate deadly viruses diseases, people still simply trust vaccines work. get second shot tomorrow I'm nervous hell. I've read second shot worse. 


First shot felt like effects wasp sting 4 days. 

My mom fine, however dad flu like symptoms. 

Just want get with. time? not, minimizing efforts, genetic study, one thing... control personal risk think. divide proactiveness get vaccine danger self, might even come favor. Honestly, need pick date restrictions drop. got vaccine, good. want it, good luck. Soylent. Sounds right lol are, except pride america Good point.  think drill provincial stats toggle different reports it‚Äôs Canada. 

The covid data collected provincially submitted federally published canned / preset public reports ‚Äòquick stats‚Äô. 

Decision makers definitely get much depth group reports based larger data sets presented experienced data analysts. 

If regular person wanted analysis believe submit data request - usually isn‚Äôt instant - still actual humans process requests strict process ensure data accurate de identified etc. 

It‚Äôs balance transparency privacy. Giving enough info much people drown it. know. Pfizer refused local trials approached Indian gov. someone followed rules, also struggled year find job, resent worked home, partied large groups reward mental health ""they major exposure grocery stores visiting one 10 bubble households"". 

Who moved family homes essentially private wing, putting rent money bank, stressed dwindling checking savings accounts, worried would run hired extended benefits. 

I stressed living grandmother, grocery shopping her, taking appointments, terrified bringing Covid home occasional babysitting gig picked make ends meet, point wearing mask anywhere house except bedroom ten minute showers took shared bathroom. probably worry problem now. someone close gets sick can't pay for, sudden becomes real. 
 
And would rather 37th 30th, know tell buddy. get sick guess. far know shitshow rollout there. husband's family 60+ week got appointments getting next month, ones closer 90 told go 50+ km get theirs... without provided transport too.

TIL! agree transparency regarding scope essential. anyone really ignorant enough think pandemic would last months? think anyone believed that. least one knew did. live? particular virus type might give name like SARS-CoV-2 less ""species"" constantly shifting sea variants. viruses variants. normal &amp; expected. people vaccinated immune system kept date thru community exposure. stay good physical condition fight like variants cold &amp; flu viruses, etc. people downvoting I'm sure looked Italy Jan/Feb 2020 thought ""Sucks them"" ignored it. physician doesn‚Äôt demand called *doctor* either. 
When go see optometrist year, refer ‚ÄúDr. Smith‚Äú thinking it, think may best healthcare professionals introduce credentials, like posters said.

That way patients know type ‚ÄòDr.‚Äô treating them. Yes, credentials white coat badge, patients going read understand letters mean? Yah employees realized could job remote, abandoned expensive apartments barely large enough live in, let alone work in, since timeline opening back offices still air, least delayed reopening many offices can't force someone move instant like that... 

Plus renting office space expensive smaller companies pay desk equipment (they anyway) pay person's WiFi bill. Let employee pay rent office space lol Well live Mexico can‚Äôt imagine level frustration government üò£ scope practice entirely different nurse nurse practitioner. Nurses diagnose, prescribe, devise treatment plans.

Nurse practitioners things. Calling nurse practitioner nurse misnomer. Disingenuous. doctorate degree mean demand called ""Dr. x."" Go hospital guarantee find pharmacists physically therapists demanding called Dr. unblinded? people go 150k debt english degree

sometimes mama papa need little bit say, considering gonna co-sign loan country beat 2 times (it kept coming back immigrants neighboring countries) year trouble due one variants. countries part, many extremely contagious variants. People stopped caring Sept / Oct itself. New Hampshire's ""mandate"" teeth anyways, wore masks choice implemented still are. I'm really sure user keeps obsessively posting state move completely meaningless. kind unique vehemently anti mask pro vaccine time, makes think capable understanding everyone wants vaccine gotten one yet that's masks still polite thing (until everyone waiting vaccine gets one).

Like least third post I've seen OP topic, would really appreciate would stop trying advertise NH kind safe rude people. arent. Yes that‚Äôs want do. Spread conspiracy theories Florida. ü§£ü§£ nurse...a nurse practitioner. nurse practitioner still called nurse advanced practice nurse. 

Also difference master science nursing doctor nursing practice handful administrative leadership classes. additional medical knowledge. So? assume everyone sees ""new variant"" reads ""new antibody resistant vaccine"" point tons new variants found time, ones matter thus get reported antibody resistant. 3 Lakh = 300,000 health insurance won‚Äôt cover COVID treatments decided get vaccinated. mean Florida actually seen actual increase Texas saw decrease. important point, one things note California's COVID cases ticked lower TX FL. none 3 states *spike* like winter. CA settled 6 cases per 100K, compared 10 TX 29 FL. Positivity rates 1.0, 6.7, 10.5 respectively per random website found.

Now there's always randomness involved (you predicted Michigan not, say, Ohio would worst surge January), possible CA better FL worse pure randomness. think suggest reopening probably *does* effect, common sense would imply.

But vaccines natural immunity mean 50% population susceptible virus, odds exponential growth much lower (though, low probability mean impossible Michigan revealed). So, sense, exponential spread feared March ended less likely expected. Given politics constituents, think modal resident three states reasonably satisfied. did! came back completely normal. got sent home explanation, I'm thinking problem.

Unfortunately it'd probably late Olympics. large swathes American populace genuine morons throughout entirety pandemic stop now? don‚Äôt disagree, however take issue say nurse. She‚Äôs not. doctor nurse practitionership. Also IIRC Japan ordered lot moderna vaccines US company could significantly help Literally zero evidence provided. researchers said mutations could make resistant antibodies. bet it‚Äôs got E484K/E484Q mutation that‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs trash article I'd say helps much give antivaxers point vaccines turning people zombies, own. both, ""All restrictions gone starting July 4th weekend 60% country vaccinated, whichever comes first."" run NS IV. one industry spread covid passengers other....remember ships struggling find port offload passengers many caught virus could get hospital.....
Tens thousands stranded sea people seriously want type environment ....Good luck expect special treatment deaths door  doses % relevant extremes, small changes expected every state basically hovering around number. top that, number based many factors, logistical vaccines arriving delivered inoculators, vaccines kept reserve whatever reasons to, vaccines transported 1 place another. again, useless stat unless ridiculous extreme course could done things better. see think country wealth handle COVID better. obvious countries who've experience dealing pandemics countries compliant populations fare best. Also countries already naturally isolated (New Zealand) natural advantage too. wear masks stop spread virus think they're fun look vaccinated effectively means spreading virus. benefit wearing mask vaccinated negligible. think CDC needs learn thing two you? trust they're correct say vaccinated effectively eliminates spread. India exception take right steps chance. SII begging funding increase production. got approved yesterday. surge contained, head politician upfront taking credit instead strengthening medical system.

The utter neglect healthcare government brought here. surge totally avoidable. know, people I've talked younger plans getting vaccinated seem apathetic hesitant hostile. feel they're much risk think worth hassle. stupid. yea, saying dont follow science, got lol Scientists correctly tell us masks reduce spread infectious disease. They've known decades. Politicians never acted knowledge viruses like flu concept acceptable risk. Biden encouraging vaccinations saying mask mandates apply vaccinated Americans would likely result reducing apathy. I'm sure explain clearly.

People like masks. getting vaccinated meant wear mask, people would eager get vaccinated. simple see what's making confusing. ridiculously stupid. never 100% efficiency supply demand NEVER field. \~10-15% homes vacant time yet homelessness. people want homes?? No. there's buying selling people moving, etc. 

Same thing vaccinations, need distributed matched arm. There's whole mess logistics happen get shot arm lag time inefficiency gap see.

Another point: Polling indicates least 70% people willing get vaccine right now. We've currently vaccinated much much fewer that. issue demand. Agreed. extremely divisive. see you‚Äôve never tried find care Medicaid easy wear mask though, wear annually flu season regardless. I'm sure would save lives. headline extremely disingenuous. first one hit hour 103 fever felt like drug almost, never covid, never even left house year, saw friends since covid started, still haven‚Äôt, it‚Äôs weird, hopefully second one doesn‚Äôt anything cause pretty heavy Lol guy telling people read understand things getting schooled policy analyst pointed understand source citing.

Man's complains redditors uninformed that. comes tool lmao. point travel ban doesn‚Äôt work Covid, much silent transmission, unless country completely shut border like North Korea, it‚Äôs going stop virus. seem agree me, don‚Äôt know trying argue? Well, message consistently get vaccinated, social distancing masks still required. So, there's lot apathy. So, see benefit vaccine. Nothing changes. Agreed. better let tens thousands people die flu rather wear mask. pointless? even gave 10% discount supply logistics transporting doses. I'm sure else able tell state supply constrained, declaring like are. 

And states using larger percentage doses consistently 85% even 90%? That's point. People get mad people can't simple thing like wear mask COVID, also 'simple thing' flu season. somehow doubt many people biden cult lol. cdc says masks arent necessary fully vaccinated, thats that. then, follow science rather random dude r/coronavirus *regardless Honestly I'm happy discussion ü§£ talked mom phone morning decided get one vaccines. conversation would much nervous even though know people gotten issues. 

So thank relieving mind even knew needed relieved. know there‚Äôs concerns variants, since people vaccinated almost guaranteed get sick die almost everybody risk America then, cases longer hold weight don‚Äôt hold nearly much potential harming people. soon come time barely mean all. Americans get increasingly vaccinated, yes cases, soon almost always mean sniffles likely nothing compared death disability like used to. Hospitalizations deaths matters, they‚Äôre reason ever cared Covid first place. root cause suffering. they‚Äôre gone, cat declawed longer feared exists. live El Paso, never affected :)  unfortunately people listen politicians celebrities scientists. Fix electric grid get back us. know Canadians must absolutely livid Americans better something. That's way things always be. never get point zero risk.  biden that? let scientists make decisions, politicians statement implies died virus must stupid. Nice one. nation does. [Mitchell Webb Really good post, posts really insightful general. It‚Äôs frustrating see media coverage have:

Vaccines extremely effective safe, know worst voices get amplified, there‚Äôs much misinformation coming ends spectrum. Went backyard BBQ recently much anxiety even though outdoors literally everyone fully vaccinated. Yea, moderna stopping well IP law. anxiety disorder, afraid everyday situations norm many people, add pandemic top get people hard time letting go extra anxiety over. 

Thankfully I'm scared grocery store anymore panic/flight mode still kicks hear people cough public, particularly wearing mask. hope goes away knowing probably won't. People downvoting sounds reasonable me. everyone going feel way course. vaccinated means keep wearing mask, keep distancing, keep dealing restrictions. people vaccinated absolutely serious risk. motivate people get vaccinated Fauci Biden keep saying ""It's safe so"" absolutely interest explaining they'd consider safe restrictions go away.

The supply problem. availability problem. messaging problem. right messaging vaccination change anything anybody. Anyone expect result large scale apathy would completely insane. D614G made wild type wuhan extinct within months due much infectious was. mutants wildtype wuhan US seattle chicago. sure I‚Äôm misunderstanding wrote you‚Äôre misunderstanding works. clarify: shot gets cells make spike protein.  immune system reacts protein.

So yes, vaccine causes immune response. shot body fighting invader. It‚Äôs harmless protein body doesn‚Äôt know that.

Biden needs say vaccinated means wear mask people wear masks say they're vaccinated!

They already wearing masks. hardly matter. new concern people feel vaccinated accomplish anything. Telling getting vaccinated means another year masks, distancing, tells bother. time stop amplifying apathetic attitude. must USA. 

Ikke rigtigt.

The problem EU want pay price nations outbid us. nothing bullying. Israel payed whopping 47usd per pfizer vaccine, whereas EU negotiated 14.7usd per pfizer Wasnt 100 million 100 days Biden's initial goal called lofty? doubled couple weeks spare. math completely wrong tho. even hesitant states, seeing significant amounts people getting vaccinated, means smaller % people lazy like say people completely hesitant anti-vax. therefore, bigger issue hesitancy anti-vaxxers, apathy. dont get wrong, issues, hesitancy anti-vax far bigger % population lazy apathetic Lets put way... ""evenly"" distributed like detergent. Even so, plenty available appointments pharmacies (that's including state-run ones listed).

And currently 7M excess vaccines California. Let's say hitting 90% usage realistic logistics large state. leaves us 6.3M excess doses still able used.

If bump average 550k day, there's still around ~11 days supply. next week's allocation coming minimum 2M doses.

I definitely think California may state increasing daily average though, could easily become supply-constrained next days (even NH, Maine, etc trending daily average)  I‚Äôm guessing hepatitis shot fully approved FDA, unlike Covid vaccines correct?  California here, you‚Äôll get ‚Äúfree joints‚Äù quickly, despite insane sounds üòé should‚Äôve paused unforeseen complication determine best course action. Fortunately one rare enough it‚Äôs best continue using vaccines. bet salty case we'd going consistent rate hit least 60% adults even hesitant states. fact we're seeing slowdown early indicates many, many people consider pain ass process getting vaccinated worth benefits. I'm sure lot people going say people stupid selfish whatever, attitude superiority going help get people vaccinated.  disagree all. fly NYC show vaccination card? yes withdrawal, pass. know vomiting, definitely headaches fatigue pure depression. go away.

Not really. always exponential, numbers small enough take us notice fast actually growing.

But COVID-19 quite contagious, around 1.4-3.9, could infect hundred million around month starting one person. think still mixture new variant mixed lax shutdowns recent days. OH HUMANITY Idk word chose. mean anything necessarily bad - use anecdotes make generic conclusion
- commenting research actually denying vaccine, they're employed (and whether employed all).
- legitimate reasons distrust vaccines many minority communities particularly black community subject government experiments. government actually needs win trust. Ah reading az. thought same. Yeah, don‚Äôt give shit. Can‚Äôt get back normal soon enough. study rated US ""responsiveness"", quality service individuals receiving treatment, 1st, compared 7th Canada.

In U.S., patients Medicaid, low-income government programs, wait maximum 12 weeks see specialists (12 weeks less average wait time Canada).

Healthcare providers required law clear training credentials. misleads public put trust you. show data. Today's number hospitalized 372. Ten days ago 312. That's 60 person increase, 60/312 = 19.2%.

(Before someone mentions -- yes, 7 day average 20%. hospitalizations one metric 7-day average likely worse daily count, stable case hospitalizations. Meanwhile, 7-day average undercount cases rising overcount cases falling, reasons self-evident.) meaning Princeton? I'd think answer question would obvious.  Hawaii one well.

India, Brazil, Philippines, Chile name few. making joke...Holy hell ""study percentages work"" - Jesus Christ ... wtf even trying say? love people get worked joke. wear mask time leave house. good portion country completely stupid treat pandemic seriously. okay face reality massive under-reporting expected allowed/approved? since phase 3.

Is efficientie measured vaccine? figured 2 weekly pcr test, biotech/moderna test symptoms. Wow, guys unbelievable. Even everyone dying streets would refuse admit potential risks mutations. literally care long kiss you. I'm saying whether science says not, tell makes teeth look cleaner removes bad tasting smelling crap. boss's boss. said vaccines protect maybe 3 mos. means want maintain good base immunity office would need schedule people shots sooner 3 mos. means rotating people every couple weeks. shots making lot people sick that's rotating chunk workforce sick shot every week. sees masks really reasonable thing prevent virus thinks office require times go back.

FWIW, also reasoning getting shot himself. Since, according him, gives 90 days immunity, maybe 6 mos tops worth get similar results wearing mask. Yes, it‚Äôs mega depressing - numbers like mean it‚Äôs anti-vaxxers right-wingers getting it. There‚Äôs big chunk people lazy saying they‚Äôre going bother. 

Even I‚Äôve seen number ‚Äúwell I‚Äôm afraid vaccine I‚Äôm young won‚Äôt die virus I‚Äôm going bother.‚Äù totally missing point herd immunity virus mutations. stark reminder west far over. Even richest countries world cusp herd immunity seems like disease starting get hold poorest countries. massive global vaccine shortage right now. taking vaccine need. breath completely fine cause brush teeth .. cleans teeth...as said flossing CLEAN PLAQUE... that's lie faked flossing companies sell products... that.. called placebo effect... Fauci said that's really rare least Covaxin seems effective Indian variant, according data today. there's good possibility vaccines also effective (even though can't extrapolate much vaccines).

I feel like sadly, hope end pandemic Covid19 limited number possible advantageous immune escape mutations, see globally slow virus mutation speed. Unless vaccine manufacturers miraculously produce faster...our endgame covid's limits mutating. I't eventually reach treathening variant, vaccines still protect it, we'll fine. AZ delivering whole fiasco EU. Germany, France rest defamed AZ hard threatened lawsuit last 3 months. look ty treat J&amp;J treated AZ, vaccines come Ad6.

Its normal want investigate halt AZ EU 1 250,000 chances clear bias. EU slapped that. Seems fine dont whine now. UK btw. wear mask bank? jail

dont wear mask bank? also jail 3 million new Covid cases first 21 days April. put perspective, India 2 million new cases Jan 1st March 31st. good sign. clear large percentage adult population never thought much vaccines past months. Texas according CDC 26th per capita gun deaths. nice freaking try. üò≥ ignorance! Texas second populace state...so yes...they gun deaths..: say Connecticut. LOL, trust me, he's sociopath! guy probably also claims Covid deaths inflated car accidents suicides still insisting unrelated heart attack vaccine's doing. simple answer vaccines around 6 months people certain effective 6 months. mean ""only"" 6 months. vaccines effective years, usually basically entire life. Could imagine blowback within US started giving vaccines population vaccinated? people morons. US definitely start sending vaccines near future, don‚Äôt want cede influence China Russia. No. fully vaccinated. pretty middle pack comes vaccinations. 

It look like worst new cases. Positivity rate daily cases dropped 8-9K 6-7K last week. However vaccines working experiencing quarter deaths winter surge definitely spiked given previous surges. crap one making appointments definetly think walk-ins probably best way reach alot people. Pretty wild imo walking street able get vaccine problem. scavanging sites. I'm happy getting available slippery slope. People stop wearing masks outside, forget home car, mask compliance goes even necessary. wear mask outside near others numbers waaay down. Well, masks first suggested last year, nobody knew COVID could spread easily outdoors. now, research, know outdoor transmission without close contact rare. think 80% Americans wearing masks outdoors come summer. clearly stated complete block vessel. thai due vaccine completely ruled out.

You really need stop spreading assumptions misinformation kind facts. Bell's Palsy early possible side effect (debunked think) MRNA vaccines, also mimic stroke. wonder symptoms related, literally coincidence. 

Or could something totally unique sinovac obviously, idea.

No evidence brain scans something seriously wrong though good news. New York lawmakers put finishing touches piece legislation mandating extensive new workplace health safety protections response COVID crisis.

The New York Health Essential Rights Act, NY HERO Act, sponsored state Sen. Michael Gianaris (D-Queens) Assemblywoman Karines Reyes (D-Bronx), calls fines businesses fail adopt enact new standards protect workers stem spread coronavirus airborne diseases.

‚ÄúToo many workers already sacrificed health community‚Äôs benefit,‚Äù Gianaris said Senate passed measure Tuesday. ‚ÄúThe New York HERO Act honors efforts giving workers tools protect job.‚Äù

The union-backed bill directs Department Labor issue airborne infectious disease standards businesses that‚Äôll include protocols testing, face masks, personal protective equipment, social distancing measures.

The standards crafted industry-specific worker committees, bill also includes strong anti-retaliation provisions allow workers call employers without fear reprisal.

New York State Senate Deputy Majority Leader, Michael Gianaris (D-Queens)¬†(Hans Pennink/AP)

‚ÄúThe devastating infection rate death toll continues ravage New Yorkers, result COVID-19 pandemic, shows status quo broken‚Äî workers must meaningful workplace health safety protections, real enforcement,‚Äù said Dennis Trainor, vice president CWA District 1. ‚ÄúThis legislation long-overdue step ensure workers protected job, call Gov. Cuomo sign bill law.‚Äù Yes do. list kinds dates, government us. made promises cannot uphold believed (we know better now) many people follow rules (look RIVM compliance metrics google mobility trends) put us shit now. 

Also, opening schools mistake. schools closed little longer, know would hard, would much better position could reopened weeks ago. trying UK, much higher number infections significantly lower vaccination grade.

The hospitals currently extremely fragile position. max regular capacity since October last year (including COVID non-COVID patients mandatory BOSS beds). Currently around 1,400 beds needed ICU everything. means currently 28% regular capacity ICU. occupancy increasing currently. 

They ""expanded"" capacity, farce, amount ICU nurses physician increasing. putting even bigger workload them, calling ""extra beds"". accept extremely busy last 6 months change time soon. 

And think care? care postponed now, people get ICU, postponed. last week's constantly decreased care make sure could handle increase COVID patients. decrease regular care take even long postponed care stack even more. postponed care done wave well, means full ICU's wave even longer. 

All terrible situation ICU's. Currently many COVID patients ICU mid-May last year regular now, many ICU patients total since end-April.

And audacity ask people ICU accept risk extra load ask audacity ask government wait letting go restrictions? ... Go back school study percentages work. Idiot. Yep, always say. look Brazil, India Italy beginning would like. per capita, Texas highest number gun deaths. nice try argument hinges entirely ""personal experience"" instead facts figures point to, throw bombs like ""you clue talking about""? feel like would happened already  even talking about? Throw shit front doors?! serious? Looks like seriously repeating sort talking point heard once. Houston, reaching point far doses demand. kind concerning despite stat saw said 43% adults gotten least one dose. 


The demand bottomed completely major vaccine sites taking walk-ins. wonder covid came 1918 many people would died??? many people carrying get variants regardless fast mutates. Since virus prevalent countries like Brazil india right lot opportunities virus roll lucky dice develop mutations gain advantage previous strains. keep happening countries currently spreading uncontested get shit together get top it. took dog long walk yesterday wearing mask outdoors nobody within 500 yards 99% time. time approached someone, got dirty look slowly put mask glared me. swerve way give distance mind you, kept walking line really wanted know much affecting them.

So tired nonsense. mask mandate outdoors. human beings radioactive death traps.  Good. 

Let‚Äôs fools like India help going around saving world.  advice lines CDC well state‚Äôs health board. mild symptoms, aren‚Äôt contagious ten days first symptoms. don‚Äôt think NYS would tell it‚Äôs safe resume life didn‚Äôt honestly believe that. 

I‚Äôm playing safe still anything 10 days positive test. don‚Äôt even plans see anyone anything family trip. 

I also second shot flight. Every bit immunity helps. don‚Äôt understand point here. Fully vaccinated Florida woman here, wear mask required make fully vaccinated yet feel comfortable wearing theres. month two unvaccinated adults (mostly) unwilling get vaccine, ditch thing. Lol, people get shot Texas America. Texans also regularly throw shit front doors homes. weather also, disgusting Texas. No. SH battlefield started WWII. hate name many people allover world. fear, us Hoosiers fuck folks months. Oh man I've super spicy indian food kept coming back day, breath horrible see point thing grows exponentially. 10 days number death going least 5000, continue double burns out. daily deaths could like 80,000 per day more. course crazy numbers.  I‚Äôd feel comfortable going domestic wedding fully vaccinated chance I‚Äôd go international one right now, mostly wouldn‚Äôt want get stuck Poland anything borders happens. Also, small chance got COVID, I‚Äôm guessing wouldn‚Äôt want deal foreign country. guys still going 4 million? That's less 20% AZ vaccines presently US. US absolutely plans use domestically. send literally anywhere else. Well sounds like got year's notice originally get updates meantime. made edit ya. would ashamed live place named like that. probably read article 6 month update phase 3 studies. 

They still found effective immunity 6 months post vaccination. cannot say longer sure cannot see future. 

That said highly likely immunity lasts much longer 6 months, likely years even decades.  go covidactnow longer Well good news flights cheap.

I dunno pretty complicated, personally would probably go. vaccinated would feel safe, I'd eager travel, companies asking people come back work certain date going expect people phase back time various reasons, example might vaccinated living situation may changed knows what.

But friend's perspective, else people coming wedding, big going be, indoors? US UK probably best among large developed countries example they're going get people Europe, sounds risky people, unless get vaccinated somehow. I'm sitting desk work typing this. liberal AF Connecticut. I'm wearing mask. see others desk mask. hell people comments even exist? really exist? thing people break rules order party issue ignoring curfews well. one thing rebel against. not, every ""compulsory"" voluntary vaccination inside body, last one flu autumn. Yet 100% agree post replying to. risk individual level kicked de rug ""overall good"" age split far published UK.

And one showed clearly risk inverse age, risk serious covid goes way. looks Ontario, rest Canada far tell. wear mask outside businesses? False. nice try. showing ignorance. moved California. third world shit hole. watched shit hole happen past 43 years. cal dirty full trash. Texas cleaner, better air, work done infrastructure, waaaay better schools, safer. Woot! difference schools insane. California amazing district California... doesn‚Äôt even compare Texas. thought process baffles me, exactly experience correlate literally anyone else? Glad get anything stuck teeth? come extremely unlikable using toothpick equivalent using floss. also packed comment full contradictions.. maybe sit one out? Restrictions many places already removed 10/10 would preferred month strict lockdown bullshit year. look big states similar levels infection per capita past year. Michigan relatively less reverting mean will. Specifically less ""herd immunity"" going spring compared California, Texas, New York Florida. natural immunity goes away. people catch COVID-19 twice. Seems like 3 months norm. invitations go six eight weeks wedding. gives guests plenty time clear schedules make travel arrangements live town. destination wedding, give guests time send three months ahead wedding‚Äù That's sounds incredible, I'm almost considering jumping plane answer. frightening 
\- derivative total number death increasing (2000/day).  
\- derivative derivative also increasing (142/day\^2). That's acceleration daily deaths. 
\- derivative derivative derivative also increasing (20/day\^3), that's acceleration acceleration daily deaths. 


Yep, that's look exponential. Also high % taking vaccine? one really knows. People ""obeying"" restrictions maybe like worse state right now.

One big contributing factor youth sports restarted routine testing become required participants. like less 10. OMG AZ delivering doses ordered. Poland we'll getting around 30k AZ next week, 1.2M Pfitzer, even though ordered roughly similar amounts never halted using AZ. that's mean best. I'm pretty sure vaccines exported countries months back, really approved India. Better provide countries leave rotting freezer.(Obviously vaccines ""rot"" believe get gist). I've talking several people work 100% convinced vaccine gives immunity 3-6 mos. They're saying means may never able really get back office we'll required wear masks desks 8 hrs day reasonable precaution take. Keeping kind database who's vaccinated practical need new shot ever 3 mos. anyone idea idea coming shot good 6 mos tops? risk seems similar (essentially close zero) supply situation fact J&amp;J single dose that's potentially effective SA variant would lead prioritize AZ. think mean would hypocritical ban AstraZeneca allow J&amp;J, thought problem blood clots. 

It would incompetent ban due low incidence blood clots leaving country limited vaccine options. got second shot Monday; say wait two weeks state decides drop mask mandate. would y‚Äôall recommend do? need continue wear one shopping stuff since would fully vaxxed would even worry? want get back normal possible also don‚Äôt want part problem alter headline ""a little"". wrote entirely new headline. see anything death reduction? read pdf couple news articles see explicitly listing death hospitalization percentages. Reddit user extra qualifications tell others think. Believe them, perform research! ""might be""

Pretty sure case. It‚Äôs frustrating still people alarmist see picture video pedestrians without masks outside. ‚Äúyeah science rocks!‚Äù people there, still don‚Äôt seem realise outdoor transmission incredibly low. think anti vaxxer doesnt mean aren't.

You refuse vaccinated due pseudoscientific arguments exaggerate risks. anti vaxxer. Sorry say. also Sam Adams sending beer money people get vaccinated, Krispy Kreme giving away donuts! Come America, get vaccine, receive joint, beer, donut :) thinking massive contingency people think changes DNA radio chip it. get nonsense from? I,m sorry usually nice polite fellow spreading BS international forum stuff comes behind.

Now say sorry, delete edit false post again! anti-vaxxer. Texas: 3,297 new cases/day 
2,855,052 total cases

The numbers available anyone willing look up. don‚Äôt see successful campaign covid. Texas increasing currently. Well least Kejriwal seemed somewhat honest situation. That's least good start. doesn‚Äôt. many factors play claim you‚Äôre responding true. Sure infections play role clearly important factors person ignoring. takes 3 weeks first dose work (real world data based Israel, clinical data showed 2 weeks). there's lag even works. Add re-opening + people refusing get vaxx + death lags hospitalization lags getting sick lags getting infected... *will* come down. People say Texans still wearing masks, that's usually business asks to. Restaurants busy while, packed last weekends. make wear mask go Rangers Ballpark, nobody really wears game. People still meeting homes maskless about.

I've Pfizer shots last month choice I'll go maskless store mask mandated store. point, got let go. vaccines available everyone, couple months away old normal. Cool. Canada still allowing flights India daily.. sad Health Canada (and associated orgs) repeatedly said spread air.

This guy, Ionnadis - arrogance assholes. That‚Äôs one data point also. Texas trickier component New York...vast rural populations etc. second number vaccine case load per capita Texas much lower new York! reported blood clot issues happen within two weeks administration (this true AZ well) occurring within 10 days. We're getting closer window additional issues occurred. Therefore, number could still go (we're days away 10 days cases happen) *increasingly* likely - we're running time cases appear. 

There's really cause action could cause issues line simply virtually residual vaccine material residual spike protein leftovers body get weeks out. blood clot going happen, going happen early. Agree. last 24 hours 300,000 cases reported country. 2000 deaths big lie created government seem like control. mean, 1.4 billion people, easy vaccinating everyone. least that's something govt's best.  stopped testing. live Texas. Testing available place. get test anywhere everywhere. kid said headache day got kids tested 29 minute later. That‚Äôs complete BS.  course it‚Äôs old white dude living Calgary, center redneck conservatism Canada. probably also denies climate change. 

I born Calgary never live again. know, vaccinated also symptoms survive yo  It‚Äôs interesting dilemma, risk healthcare system ends. One could argue masks pushed, would reduced case count thus alleviating potential collapse due demand. hand, medical practitioners taken out...you supply. Since latter much smaller, specialized workforce, chose healthcare professionals. detriment long term public health trust. win situation. Actually Texas pretty bad. New York, nearly 44% population gotten one shot vs 35% Texas. Texas essentially stopped testing. Nobody really knows caseload there. know masks slow rT 1

Nobody thread except expects masks, single measure, bring reproductive number 1 own. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

That said, certainly AIDS fear crisis resulted demonization Gay Men Black people persists day. stigma already began affecting Asian people time around.  Boston University   think synonymous turning lights Britain WW2. people would definitely said, ""You turn lights afraid, I'm going live life fear."" putting energy respond something 7 Days later really terrible argument pathetic. Take mine, burnout. mention Texas almost testing relative population size ... idea true state virus there. also know widespread variant may may be.  blood clot thing... 

About 300 million vaccinated world wide. Less 100 reported blood clot issues, think fewer 20 deaths. True. don‚Äôt recall worldwide lockdowns anything. it‚Äôs transmissible air. ? said ""they power whatsoever give carrot stick."" absolute narcissistic psychopath single handedly destroyed country. Belive me, makes even Trump seem reasonable. strong effect? article say.  look doses percentage population, US blows Inda China water. California opened 50 6 days ago. lot states opened everyone. think we‚Äôll see big jumps 50 soon. Agreed. Notice didn‚Äôt respond case load too. Texas isn‚Äôt problem child right now. I‚Äôm two weeks second dose. Sorry, I‚Äôm done. understand empathize sentiment, but, individual perspective, really do? see many people trying spread positive vaccine information helping friends family get appointments. People trying help influence.

Once situation US control, start exporting vaccines. Well, live suburbs, it‚Äôs hit miss. I‚Äôm opposed crowded downtown area cross paths multiple times someone. But, go normal walk cross maybe 2 people it‚Äôs easier cross street. somehow biggest 4th quarter collapse Michigan history. Second largest population. Makes sense. say, inactivated vaccines moment, Covaxin consistently looked best. press release also claims protection asymptomatic infection 70%, excellent. I'm definitely one cautious ones sub, I'm coming hard...

But there's HIV vaccine. think might confusing science arm political arm. 

Restrictions political thing, science thing. Scientists power require people anything. could see unusually large set scientists get year. Perhaps five six sharing prize developments done many teams many years saved millions lives. I‚Äôm you.

Soul crushing Ontario restrictions. Lol, none things listed currently permitted Ontario!  Hey, Canada guys fell asleep vaccine rollout, vaccine manufacturing capabilities, mooch US get trouble. Something like that?

edit: made PC. think good plan. treated anxiety issues past, doc told work building little successful events - diving headfirst problem. So, week second shot started going restaurants patio. Safer, still step toward normal. Also, patios awesome. Source?? Masks playgrounds idiotic. Outdoor transmission covid extremely unlikely. Plague Games small number people infected say one way other. Sometimes moma papa need let kids grow make decisions it‚Äôs life. Even less motivation get then. lives barely changed. bother vaccine Chili‚Äôs still open there‚Äôs mask mandate? Lots people getting get semblance normal life back people already normal lives without vaccine. hate it. Unneccessary annoyance opinion furthers divides us people vaccinated unvaccinated group. People anti-vaxx get strengthened view vaccines evil government wants force us.

A brief intermediate period like 70% vaccination rate, say 2-3 months, kind acceptable scenario. defense cell vaccinated people infect others vaccinated get ill die since cells work slowly AFAIK. leads believe they'll ""bite us ass""? nobody stores long term either since steel tanks cylinders cost gas. Tokin rest us sitting thumbs asses. ‚Äúthis number could go looking increasingly likely not‚Äù - getting info? Side effects over-represented reddit forums line due selection bias. vast majority people sore arm. Curfews solution often-repeated meme infections growing due people organising secret parties night homes. 

I seen data proving significant location spreading infection. happen? sure. significant activities people getting infected essential workplaces, shopping, medical facilities, schools... sure, least seen data exists.

Judging despite curfews infections still growing NL, think assume helping much.  You‚Äôve got point. Perhaps it‚Äôs set young people (not every young person gives shit environment) I‚Äôm sure least overlap there, would hypocritical indeed. many hate filled losers thread. 

Anyway, Korea feeling love soon. vaccination United States mostly done next four weeks, leaving tens millions rerouted friends allies. 

There special bond Korean people bravely stand shoulder shoulder boys protect liberty freedom. true friends. close friend dating loser, tell them? Someone still feed them.. Trucks still show food that's enough get least one person sick spread it. virtue signaling, politeness. know science outdoor masking different point, since state outdoor mandate lots people wearing masks outside, too. less pain wear constantly take off, especially headphones on. May first state's mandate ends, I'll taking then. Sure, emergency we're experiencing yet seems bit premature worry about. Pleasantly surprised minimal side effects far. stomachache last night sore arm I‚Äôm actually pretty good, least better expecting. 

I‚Äôll see today goes. I‚Äôve taking Tylenol help arm hydrating lot friend are. ‚ÄúDo say can‚Äôt friends‚Äù. mean, think it‚Äôs pretty dumb keep covid restrictions place protect lazy, apathetic young morons. they‚Äôre lazy get shot catch covid concert something, that‚Äôs 100% them. shouldn‚Äôt trying protect people won‚Äôt protect themselves. Aside posted lot easier getting food un-stuck teeth gums floss rather stabbing toothbrush. health official draws dose AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine manufactured Serum Institute India, Infectious Diseases Hospital Colombo, Sri Lanka January 29, 2021.

Coronavirus infections also rose record, increasing 295,041 last 24 hours, data showed. time throwing away nationalism long ago, world heading direction. yet proven effective


So like... Israel UK count eh? Ahahaha

Get bent vassal states imperial periphery, imagine would risk American human capital... mean ""lives"" extent. supposed move India summer. However, program receives funding Department Education. Since U.S. government COVID-related advisories place, program's administrators decided move online. 

Sort sucks. know India's getting hit hard, fianc√©e lives able meet year now. Yeah nothing burger far article concerned. AstraZeneca delivered vaccines NL compared Janssen deliver. AZ easy replace assign certain groups, Janssen not. 

They talking giving AZ people 60 agreed GP - currently AZ doses reserved group 60-64 probably single AZ dose available mid May. He‚Äôs right often most. That‚Äôs long winded way saying you‚Äôre anti-vaxxer. problem didnt dont give shit article reeks Eurocoping, guess case, Indocoping.

You'll get turn. pretty freaking clear goal 60-70% population vaccinated. becoming clear could completely end summer. people get shots.

It's insane others arguing ""people want get shot messaging told get enough people shots things go 100% back normal""

It's self defeating. that's actually people thinking answer we'll go back normal unless virus mutates less virulent infectious strain burns out. long wait covid get vaccine? Thank contributing vaccine apathy. appreciate prolonging pandemic. /s They've said meet domestic demand India international contracts. important remember source national pride India developed vaccine want well commercially export. 

Also vaccine manufactured distributed India population reliant one. rotary club met first time person year. One baby step normal.  
Thankfully don‚Äôt think anti vaxxer believe Rotary Club simultaneously since pretty much eradicated polio Africa.  
Next stop: Afghanistan Pakistan yeah sorry, explained bit better. COVID concern. I'm vaxxed ready go. Booking flight potentially shit hit fan concern. 

I know someone else mentioned concerned going back office, take time right wfh international wedding feels like bad optics. 

Do time money? Sure. wanna spend PTO days money saved vacation Poland right now? offense Poland, no. started building places I'd much rather see around United States time being, I'll start making way back international travel. leaving type blood clot, though. much dangerous type clot. Michigan still average infection numbers per capita basis. Even past two months high numbers still 40th country. 

Basically avoided lot 2020 catching up. don‚Äôt disagree all, issue people think nurse practitioners nurse. It‚Äôs inaccurate assessment.

Totally agree advertising medical doctor. idea getting pass anyone-including people care about. risk/sacrifice worth them. 

But yeah don‚Äôt know everyone‚Äôs background. bigger chance covid, that, isn‚Äôt case some. 

As said above, would choose observe 14 days vaccine rather 14 days every time feel something off. imo burdensome people care left without giving vaccine chance. I‚Äôm guessing didn‚Äôt want AZ go public early they‚Äôre 100% sure, they‚Äôre going radio silent now. Wow, guys unbelievable. You‚Äôve decided pretend it‚Äôs nearly quarter population (children) yet eligible vaccine.

And know replies be: kids don‚Äôt get sick, vaccines coming, etc, etc. Doesn‚Äôt change fact it‚Äôs ridiculous claim it‚Äôs ‚Äúover‚Äù it‚Äôs still circulating widely lot population. It‚Äôs good news highest risk people mostly vaccinated, thing ‚Äúthe pandemic over.‚Äù UK vaccine portfolio (or rather, soon be) broad enough cover UK population, without need AZ J&amp;J. need take additional risks supplies exist. Everyone covered. lived elsewhere, obviously risk assessment may differ.  fact hasn‚Äôt updated since like March 8th makes even impressive said. I‚Äôm complaining clear metrics fully lifting restrictions. don‚Äôt need date, want clear metric metrics. hard understand? aggressively defending fact states clear metric indicator lifting restrictions? It‚Äôs really data driven approach. 

If ‚Äújust seeing percent vaccinated needed‚Äù, well, needed what, exactly? Lower hospitalizations deaths cases assume? set clear metrics then? niece's boyfriend anti-vaccine he's MS. Super smart guy studying science, surprising sensed deep anti-vaccine thinking MS, peer pressure friends neighbors. Thankfully, niece gave got vaccine since way could travel back home Nepal infect parents there. Probably causes cancer too... amirite. Exactly. Michigan locked down. Vermont also super locked throughout pandemic, difference Vermont major metropolitan area like Michigan also Vermont probably MUCH liberal (and likely follow covid rules strictly) much well (meaning Vermonters likely able afford WFH effectively social distance). Michigan Detroit, well bunch covid deniers rebel covid restrictions (and also attempt kidnap governor due imposed restrictions). serious doubt rises level literal PTSD. believe 3 cases Canada seemed recovering home one, dangers long-term consequences flu already understood, treatments developed, understand annual flu vaccine best mitigate flu, non-selfish people get that. We‚Äôre months away Covid vaccine children ‚Äî months away total flu vaccine, wouldn‚Äôt seem reasonable ask experience minor discomfort could happen? India really going whole hog ""US hoarding vaccine materials"" misinformation.

Seems like every single publisher country pushing narrative US sitting mountain raw materials using.  200 people dying Covid Germany UK every day right now. 

A good chunk reductions deaths Uk due lockdown, deaths older lives followed reduction rates younger lives rather reducing really fast due vaccines, UK would still seeing 200+deaths per day too.

It might enough Pfizer around could save 240 people delays cost lives too. Ok. saying Texas big problem not? likely US buying Ocugen places order Bharat Biotech ships back US humanitarian aid countries. 

Ocugen company getting FDA approval US rights US market, since need vaccine, however Covaxin able kept room temperature 2 months standard refrigerator 2 years - ideal candidate ship around world places can't distribute vaccine like Pfizer's. can't get second dose like Canada. first dose spots only. Youyang Gu absolute legend predicting mini fourth wave getting day peak cases within two days. Called shot month half ago comment extremely irrational. Efficacy greater AZ isn‚Äôt factor consideration. vaccines used. Original commentator typo they've since fixed I'm worried saline injection, I'm looking math equation. 8000 shots produced made idk 10:1 ratio saline vaccine. one realize extra shots, people get injected whole lot vaccine been? stressing United States ‚ÄòA friend need friend indeed,‚Äô‚Äù minister, Chung Eui-yong, told reporters Kwanhun Club South Korean journalists.

Lol.

We surplus vaccines since decent amount anti-vaxxers - give shots someone else would appreciate them. mandates vaccine, personally think going happen vaccines officially licensed approved rather ""Authorized Emergency Use"". would hate become standard. That's fine. obviously meant disrespect war vet. pretending serious mental consequences pandemic shortsighted. outstanding news. scale production quickly? India use help get. Forever? Jesus. Thank God


As soon read headline cr@p pants heartbreaking applies pretending every single part process bottleneck.

For example EU planned fill finish EU produced J&amp;J doses US, US said would likely confiscate EU doses cross US border.

So US decided would rather fill finish production sitting idle rather EU getting vaccines. essential worker problem. essential worker working area 50 percent neighborhood got it. one store got it, wearing masks January. People neighborhood acting like real, cracking jokes us wearing masks. People fake coughing eachother. Bars packed. get shit together word got neighborhood one highest infection rates nyc, also everyone started seeing bodies elmhurst hospital. feel like vaccination goal end mask mandate. Like 70% eligible population fully vaccinated mask mandate ends. would give people something look forward to, goal work towards, light end tunnel. first shot Pfizer sucked, second almost nothing. haven‚Äôt COVID know ‚Äî hopefully similar experience. got Moderna 2 last week super mild too. Sore arm mild head cold symptoms ~8 hours it. enough Pfizer vaccines right cover whole population. Every single day 200+ people die COVID here. Maybe (and big maybe) there's argument people 30 take AZ. argument pretty much falls apart approach people 40s though. There's calculation even made 40+, AZ vaccine worth ""risk"" almost immediately. honestly compare war zone going public year? Seriously? war vet I'd fucking insulted. Pfizer, Moderna Novavax. combined cover enough jabs entire population UK. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've hearing year still seen rapid test used. Really? What's end point? certain number vaccinations? certain number new cases? hospitalizations? vaccine available adults? available children, too? \*is\* messaging around this, pretty weak inconsistent across state even county lines. 

I absolutely see ""over time"" communicated - think extremely poor message. vague, explain expectations getting point nothing encourage people already hesitant. there's one misconception wish would go away ""The British bad teeth."" 

They might place enormous emphasis ""Straight Bright Hollywood Teeth"" public healthcare system lets anyone go see dentist get procedures $20-$50. 

Compare America, simple trip dentist cost hundreds dollars god help need dental surgery. Children death rate very, low. lower flu kids. Around 22 gets worse flu obviously MUCH worse older people.

So always accepted certain amount risk infectious disease unless arguing risk general change diseases justification masks indoors really gone away everyone vaccinated.

Also keep mind nearly much problem overall case numbers much lower virus able replicate spread via vast majority population. school offer virtual option. half students chosen it. also mask mandate. think plenty protect kids school year. concern fall, school already announced virtual option. I‚Äôm worried mask mandates also end kids 12 still can‚Äôt vaccinated, anything protect kids. Johnson Johnson known questionable morals pursuit money way surprised numbers seem ambitious. hope pull area lockdown nearly 6 months. much, more, impact vaccination, still 45.

As selfish, I'm giving spot someone else. sure logic stands, regardless, peace decision. body, rules. cost masking? never understood position. complaining there's dates complaining newyork set date capacity increase?

So damned do, damned don't?

I'm really sure others hard time understanding - impossible predict future put date things.

As metric, we're seeing percent vaccinated needed thanks Pfizer running giant ""trial"" israel. number pretty consistent - somewhere 60-70% vaccinated needed. kidding me? flu seriously much bigger danger children's health COVID is, never forced children socially distance wear masks prevent flu transmission didn‚Äôt cite anything. espoused view interview Dr. Fauci didn‚Äôt push back all. anyone know Novavax approval taking long? vaccines heard lots speculating approval timelines, Novavax turned radio silence. possible trials deemed insufficient we're seeing crossover? supply/demand tipping point super concerning, keep scrolling hit next article, change behavior vaccine.

Both things true though. every individual jumps back 2019 behaviors right away get vaccinated end pandemic.  People need stop thinking vaccines magic bullet. important part ending COVID eliminate short term need masks distancing individual level.  don‚Äôt get stopping it. would actually sign waiver get one area hotspot. Nobody discussing chances/effects someone getting covid spreading eventually dying without option vaccine. 

in mind, got vaccine day one pandemic deaths would 1% sure. won‚Äôt overcrowded patients actually focus 1%. Wouldn‚Äôt anyone take compared year suffering? 

instead observing possible covid victims 14 days, observe vaccinated 14 days. risk less imo health workers would definitely choose option more. right put harm‚Äôs way make people‚Äôs faces comfortable.

So take children indoor dining facilities? sub used anti-indoor, maskless not, we're saying risky kids indoors masks? lack education Even everyone is. Masks good lower spread effectively free easy. aren‚Äôt effective‚Äî especially day room. 

You vastly overestimating well masks work. intricate bags (you can‚Äôt slap one together.) different disposable bioreactor systems different bag configurations. supplies super low too, many companies giving priority ‚Äúwarp speed‚Äù accounts even thin. It‚Äôs pretty cool think day vaccination period, immune system stronger COVID yesterday. 

I‚Äôm beyond excited 10 days away completely worry-free catching stupid virus anymore! also plot point Contagion? legislation required keep restrictions expires 5 months, already grumbling passed March, much doubt would pass threat imminent. face slightly comfortable‚Äù 

You certainly way building strawman, that's sure. Dont suffer tough. Tylenol worked really well me. Also avoid holding sword head screaming ""I power."" Results lightning strikes 100% time. know you‚Äôre saying. I‚Äôm NYC. believe science showing even crowded cities, virus spread outdoors. Period. We‚Äôve seen article study study showing similar conclusions. 

The exception may folks standing shoulder shoulder hours time, yelling, like nascar event somewhere.

The politicians left seem leaning towards ‚Äòbetter restrict restrict‚Äô think that‚Äôs issue leads erosion public trust gives credence conspiracy theorists.

If seen science evidence spread maskless folks passing busy sidewalks, would love see adjust views accordingly. article everything I‚Äôve seen says not. Sorey That‚Äôs said ‚Äúmetric date‚Äù. Picking metric, like percent vaccinated hospitalizations, lift restrictions means events like JnJ pulled would accounted for. states metric plan. Mask mandates literally ‚Äúindefinite‚Äù states, definite end plan end them.

Also don‚Äôt think saying ‚Äúby July 4, good chance you, family friends get together backyard neighbourhood cookout‚Äù really clear message ‚Äúmostly normal‚Äù considering pretty much everywhere US already

And additionally, think lot people interested ‚Äúactual normal‚Äù rather ‚Äúmostly normal‚Äù, in, mask mandates capacity restrictions. It‚Äôs well past time us talk plan exactly get actual normal, instead of, like, setting random dates movie theater capacity increase 8% (that‚Äôs real example coming state New York) wait 6 months

Fine me. [Here's Derek Lowe article written year discusses various vaccine types developed COVID. far COVID, mRNA (Moderna), deactivated virus (Sinovax) DNA using viral vector (J&amp;J). Novavax Phase III protein vaccine (e.g., manufacture spike protein factory inject you. Yeah. get vaccinated probably eventually get it. isolated people vaccinated. (Rural) work larger portion public facing jobs live much higher density housing average? Yeah it‚Äôs baaaaad right downvoted? It‚Äôs truth. Theres Like 3 rich countries almost over. Rest us eyeing vaccines. Whereas poorer countries probably think 2022  generally pro relaxing outdoor mask requirements, NYC people constantly forced advocacy crowds street corners waiting lights turn. think makes sense require outdoor masking metrics really good. 

Indoor, don‚Äôt see reason budge community spread basically eliminated. cost mask wearing almost zero benefit community spread pretty high.  know long term effects Pfizer Moderna vaccines yet, either. completely new technology.

Sure, point extremely unlikely long term side effects high prevalence. school offer virtual option? school district many families chose remain virtual year. Adults vaccinated really much risk children, even without mask.  plenty deluded comments people world Reddit accusing governments loving lockdowns. Unfortunately, people actually think way. You‚Äôre right ! got mighty naive view americans think, man. people vaccine skeptics *were already* private gatherings. 

'now thing, shame it, seemed bothered think anyway, definitely still stuff already doing, like wearing masks social distancing, so, since already, get vaccine start?' best pr firm business able pitch that, much less 'masks make things worse, wait, lied you, please wear two' biden/CDC/fauci trimvirate. UK, seems sign phasing Astrazeneca vaccine safer options going forward anywhere world...too much politics money involved. imagine second happening Russian vaccine. INFECTED  source antibody test statistic? opposite. He‚Äôs saying CDC hasn‚Äôt provided science justify vaccinated people wearing masks ‚ÄúBecause say so.‚Äù Texas fully open. Imagine favorite quip ‚ÄúVirus gonna Virus‚Äù You‚Äôre really naaive gullible think that‚Äôs real death count, likely it‚Äôs 10x that. Can't send people home come home we? still need treatment monitoring.

Downvote want, happened lot even places like KY OH relatively well things. happened literally every state - that's fact, opinion. What's big, grey, matter?

Irrelephant  literally saying one thing demands personal behavior evidence (which know) suggest. Vaccinated people wearing mask minimal impact transmission. want people wear masks people potentially lying. dishonest order get desired outcome.  


It's said people need wear mask. said work, reality, wanted prioritize masks healthcare workers.  


One could say motives right, said above. can't shocked people distrust showing untrustworthy. sure upward bias people experienced symptoms likely take them. hand, doubt many people vaccinated taken one. agree. think lot evidence increased transmission variants based case increases less actual scientific proof. seems assumption cases go need explanation. So, MI saying lower levels infections due high restrictions, infection gets go...and assumes B117 made easier, seem assumption. cooler weather another assumption (assumptions start crack compare neighbor states like did). 

I know sounds crazy, almost like virus little clock turns periodically. problen this, POS better put photo every death certificate Finally, someone understands statistics. There‚Äôs still ton people cross work Detroit Windsor, think it‚Äôs closed tourism article literally says officials say variant responsible rise cases India. Well dangerous outcome blood clot death right.

According article: quotes Dr Sarah Hardman, Deputy Director Faculty Sexual Reproductive we're looking maybe three 10 per million women dying result clot attributable use combined hormonal contraception.

So chance death bloodclot birth control 3-10 per million.

The figures Germany put death toll blood clots due AZ jab 3 per million UK figures put 1 per million

So even though type bloodclot dangerous AZ occurs much less still less likely die dying bloodclot birth control.

So take birth control take AZ jab. honestly think average human shit comprehending tiny risks. Despite people think, majority Americans following rules good society. believe me, look Thanksgiving/Christmas/New Years/Super Bowl/Easter surges never happened make sacrifices. 

Now, narrative needs change. We're 13 months people getting antsy ""endzone."" stayed home, masked up, cancelled vacations/weddings/birthday parties/holidays/etc, social distances, getting vaccinated virus 0.01% chance kill people affected restrictions most. 

I know me, least, I'm getting vaccinated I'm afraid virus, want life back. office 14 months, cancelled multiple get togethers family look forward to, missed weddings funerals... need feel like friends/family getting vaccinated understanding vaccines endzone. science says be... rhetoric ""Just little bit longer"" ""Just mask up, hard"" making people like me, still holds ""follow science"" narrative, seems incredibly dangerous actually saving lives long run. vaccine hesitant starting say ""Why get vaccinated nothing changes?"" something encouraging. export. know China also produce deliver vaccines 1.4 billion population. add 200 million vaccines top 260 million exported.

US numbers similar tot EU, produced around 250 300 million vaccines well (export + use). absolute amount China produced more, per capita US EU produce more. Wait, exporting vaccines countries bullying?

Geezus. Virus blast mutating left right.  many countries it‚Äôs difficult legally say can‚Äôt guests. work around curfew thus making awkward guests socialising. states, now. states, while. Ironically enough states larger vaccinated populations may restrictions longer states smallest percentage vaccinated people i.e. Alabama vs. Massachusetts (I'm latter). delivery pace two doses would arrive long cease useful. Lmfao **US:** We're leaders free world, pre-eminent power, righteous protector democracy freedoms, stand friends allies!

**Ally:** helped early pandemic, help us vaccines?

**US:** LOL. No. find interesting notes Michigan never stopped mitigation efforts - doesn‚Äôt go say likely spike occurred. says B117 biggest factor, still cold. explain Indiana Ohio aren‚Äôt also fire?

Less natural immunity thing explain neighboring Indiana Ohio also fire. wall force field separating them. linked article talks specific kind thrombosis: Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis.  

This one problematic bloods clots/thrombosis.  Depends state, I‚Äôd say summer early fall. Still think masks planes like might required.  $11B spread around multiple companies, many even produce vaccine. comparing apples oranges. 

If look Pfizer alone, US's largest supplier, Germany invested way development. Indeed Pfizer took exactly $0 Operation Warp Speed vaccine development. 

Germany also pre-ordered doses per capita, couple dozen countries. 

So... US spent less Pfizer vaccine development, less pre-orders. tell they're first line? (Hint, already gave answer post above). Yes, fully vaccinated wanting go back pre-2020 life essentially risk = doorknob licker. opposite new normal, though. folks probably get vaccines. 

If two individuals fully vaccinated bit silly keep wearing masks distancing them. English translation Got 1st moderna shot today. Im set. Ty support suggestions. Please downvote comment. Truth id care. you‚Äôre vaccinated risk contracting spreading incredibly low. health officials experts telling it‚Äôs ok vaccinated individuals loosen bit, listen them? Well that‚Äôs also said, original comment people would board still following restrictions clear end goal, maybe stop making arguments me

It consistently messaged need hit 6-70% vaccinated. majority states official goal metric lifting restrictions. want metric-driven plan fully lifting restrictions. saying I‚Äôm agreeing necessarily target metric, target metric 65% vaccinated, can‚Äôt state officials just... say make official goal fully lifting restrictions? 

Why absurd ask defending complete lack metrics-driven reopening plan states? please get little specific wink nod coupled ‚Äújust hang til enough people vaccinated‚Äù know that.

I scheduled get J&amp;J. pause, switched Moderna pretty seamlessly - appt time, location, etc.

I think we're starting bump threshold capacity give shots given current infrastructure. course, places could add supersites, etc., think would happened without J&amp;J pause. know mean I‚Äôm less concerned this.

Truth is, received emergency use authorization FDA clearance, isn‚Äôt mandatory, probably never be. opened shaky rollout much red tape much efficiently soon people needed most. Nationwide number vaccinated people staggering, ESPECIALLY since it‚Äôs risk. results pretty good.

The ones remaining younger therefore probably healthier. may feel it‚Äôs worth getting since risk much lower. may care. may put initial roll out. people even get probably won‚Äôt admitted hospital tie resources.

So, vectors. Hopefully, HOPEFULLY, risk majority vaccinated safe despite younger unvaccinated ones acting vectors.

If happens, see hospitalizations deaths continue trend down. Incidence case numbers become less meaningful, point.

So, all, plateau expected, unfortunately unavoidable, necessarily roadblock progress.  flu! /s say chief. 6 months shelf life. even much time since SII started manufacturing. Happy help! Insert scary variant talk. sub loves 500,000 doses mid-June lot one spread across multiple countries. nice gesture, everything vaccines EU, thought action earlier. mean, clearly give ""I need right justify purpose life"" kind vibes, kind asshole time. people wanted get vaccine already got it

in Philadelphia get appointment within next 10 minutes time since Monday possible, please re-submit link ~~reliable~~ left-leaning  Got moderna vaccine today. Ty kind person internet. Yeah test. wanted see get upvoted downvoted. I'm pleasantly surprised downvoted heavily. months ago think would've top comment lot support. bother signing extra doses ones original contract delivered first place? AstraZeneca first deliver doses promised first second quarter 2021 get extra EU business. goes Johnson Johnson. AZ probably able deliver promised 300M doses end year. already 60-70 percent behind schedule, next year Pfizer looks delivering 1.8B doses. Pfizer consistently underpromised overdelivered commitments.

So exercising options makes sense.

AZ J&amp;J able focus efforts elsewhere world. free weed getting vaccine respiratory virus seems like strange flex Whatever fits narrative guy.
Btw fully vaccinated greatly lowers risk catching covid eliminate it. So.. fun that.

Last read data shows 80k fully vaccinated adults roughly 6k still infected showing 90-95% effectiveness. joking. 

I don‚Äôt know flossing prevents cavities gets bits food teeth can‚Äôt bad Yeah get choose vaccine get. 


You can't simply wait different one works, like intend ensure get different one? 


Once we've offered everyone UK we'll donating excess supply elsewhere mopping refused vaccinate AZ giving personal choice, works. 


The choice get vaccinated not, pick one personally think best.  Holy heck, that's good rate! Y'all remarkably well So, actually got first pfizer shot last Friday (5 days ago)...I felt like symptoms pretty much went away end next day. I've muscle aches upper back, pretty high like shoulder blades. strange bc symptoms stopped pr quickly 1st shot, I'm stuff come 4-5 days later. this, too, many bathrooms don‚Äôt paper towels resort using one finger shirt sleeve. wish bathrooms foot handles. Exactly this. bother certain folks much people wear outside? weird. mask harder wear outside something concept basic human decency consideration alien some? Make appointment week later definitely set! good luck! Makes sense, point vaccines remove need masks distancing. Amazing news! Stop parroting reddit talking points. spreading misinformation. Check twitter. He's face nation every Sunday retweets soundbites put interview. Almost always on-point reasonable. still count really changing anything? bit performative.... 100% this. self quarantine disabled mother keep safe last year can't help feel angry give year life stupid people could ignore pandemic prolong it. Even going get 2nd shot yesterday made feel extremely uneasy.  It‚Äôs better think four categories:

**Nucleic acid vaccines** 

These messenger RNA type vaccines like Moderna, Pfizer, phase 3 Curevac fall. use genetic material (like RNA, others pipeline using DNA) hijack cells producing antigens... antigens produce immune response. It‚Äôs completely new technology rather costly times appears working best.

**Viral Vector Vaccines** 

These AZ, J&amp;J, Sputnik V are. work way nucleic acid vaccines work (hijacking cells produce antigens) use harmless, altered viruses rather RNA/DNA. don‚Äôt seem work well mRNA counter types generally cheaper produce.

**Whole virus vaccines**

This group contains inactivated virus vaccine group (Like Covaxin CoronaVac) also contains weakened live virus replication group. tried true method, often little side effects, although production storage pain.

**Protein subunit vaccines**

These vaccines use piece pathogen order invoke immune responses. Novavax‚Äôs case, it‚Äôs protein spike. also limited side effects last much longer don‚Äôt tend invoke strong immune response. He‚Äôs GOAT. Ty got moderna shot #1. Anger subsided logic returned. Pretty certain odds late 30s similar 45.

On hand, odd sort way, quite honourable jump queue. see might choose wait age group comes see knowledge available then/ vaccines offer. He's ""Has total meltdown even bring up"" stage. gotten away meddling redditors Dr. Fauci: everyone get vaccinated 

Also Dr. Fauci: won‚Äôt eat inside restaurant variants

... can‚Äôt wait people like go away. Cap Spanish Flu happened today, would also nowhere near deadly 1918. Modern medicine truly gift. really. enough people vaccinated R0 remains 1, time number cases dwindle towards zero. likelihood % vaccinated people get covid actually decrease... he's trying help stop pandemic? opposed doorknob lickers new normal? little late.

A lockdown option, probably. least huge festivals gatherings.  ton travel experience, view it. book flight, make sure connection okay (it's probably AMS) crazy restrictions. think things get better Europe out. US finishing supply allies getting production effort shortly. Otherwise might surprised nice Eastern European countries visit. Worse comes worse, take train Prague Vienna get visit city par Paris. previously Covid well. side effects dose. Sore arm, mild mild fatigue. Nothing cup coffee couldnt fix. I'm getting second jab week... Got first one 2 weeks ago. nope. wanted vaccine months ago wait cause comorbidities anything... wish could gotten done earlier. I'm fully vaccinated I'm hanging fully vaccinated friends without masks going bars restaurants stuff living life. Fuck covid. 

So no. believe said thread...I'm progressive. I'm trying teach big floss evil big glasses big clothing... companies help steal money. buy used clothing (unless socks underwear obviously) glasses get online cause I'm paying $200 something get $30... boo. Maine similar California lot people think comes COVID policies. feel excessive sure especially hiking trail example. remote, huge chance encounter people it.

Adding links noting proof policies Maine  .....why? Massive travel restrictions countries implemented 100 years ago. got second dose Moderna. got felt like sinus infection day two first shot. Anyone else get something similar 1st shot? second shot easier worse? think Hindu sects require cremation, burial. sure strict it. Also lot land hard hit regions. top scientists believe masking vaccination completely unnecessary factor vaccination apathy seeing. idea entire scientific community believes masking post-vaccination necessary correct, many actively speaking requirement every study seen ""experts"" points vaccination significantly nullifying asymptomatic spread. Whatever CDC happens saying moment necessarily representative entire scientific community necessarily scientific consensus. Again, ""experts"" monolithic group CDC infallible. mean right they're simultaneously saying schools need 3 feet distancing safe also stating exposure withing 6 feet needs treated presumptive positive quarantined. exactly also need behavioral scientists sociologists weighing scientific community communicating public shaping policy. Scientists policy experts, scientists, expecting individually shape complex policy. three jumps hoop make rain. matter slight major inconvenience, science that, works doesn't. 


Are children risk spreading dyeing without masks? same, let's dispense masks. get choose second vaccine is.

It's likely AZ none. maybe 1% vaccinated, lost race now. Pfizer/Moderna also showed 100% efficacy hospitalizations death. know true. demand bottomed completely major vaccine sites taking walk-ins.

While great much demand good sites taking walk ins. lot people opposed getting vaccine willing deal anything extremely convenient walk ins big step direction. Plus also lot people able schedule things advance due work family commitments swing site get opportunity walk ins way better situation. That's quarantine seriously (as overall demographic). literally data J&amp;J's efficacy South African variant. like tested it. part trial, showed efficacy 64% it. number based age? numbers compare people 30's? Try get Pfizer can, seems like symptoms less prevalent Moderna, pretty much everyone feels fine day two. Way way way better catching covid. do? agree completely, disagree strongly guy's original statement he'd rather get COVID.

I think statistic demographic shows risk levels vaccine anywhere near high. deaths Covid different age group deaths vaccin. older people risk would much lower one 70,000. young people might even higher. know number UK Netherlands one woman 35 died Covid. Vaccinate group women 35 Netherlands AstraZeneca would result least 5 deaths 10 cases brain damage. older person think fair sacrifice lives health young people unnecessarily. alternative. ethical question. Young people already tough time Covid. really make much difference overall result wait weeks longer alternative vaccins. think UK also bit grip ridiculous race beat EU vaccination. Sending possible surplus AstraZeneca countries elsewhere world shortage would much helpful get control worldwide pressurize young people UK taking particular vaccin. way know outbreak article happened. news would‚Äôve it. Personally consider Covid problem. fully vaccinated, put concern away. money time work this? Now, go Poland massive hassle? fly there, flight connects Amsterdam Paris, massive hassle there? quarantine?  anything else open Poland. flying way there, take week go touristy stuff open. restaurants bars open?  Yeah, know meant way phrased made look like ‚Äú20% chance dying AZ vaccine‚Äù straight lying. Oh wow prove you‚Äôve vaccinated get places? whole thing dumb. ""need"" system money pay things could come global consensus ""money exist right now, need get handle bug"" able people stay home, people need go stuff would go stuff, would spread far far slower. people would gone ""hey need money then, need now?"" well...there's that. mention people go work would all, ""Those people got sit ass this...what get this."" big mess around. 

I keep envisioning something like happening Star Trek universe there's money everybody planet going oh...okay. work serving people food stay home spread farther. Or, need go work help develop vaccine, I'll wear mask I'm exactly know spreads yet. redshirt dies somewhere ""had"" go away mission.

I imagine every country world going severe debt done...I surprised there's global blanket wipe debt everybody get numbers down. know outdoor transmission without close contact rare. 

Yep, make less 10% infections. key needed unable stay away people, like outdoor party something. reasonably able distance, needed outside. 

 a¬†[systematic published studies transmission novel coronavirus respiratory viruses, Razani colleagues found less 10 percent cases described spread outdoors. also found frustratingly papers detailed settings clearly compared indoor outdoor situations.  takeaway it‚Äôs impossible get infection outdoors, even though published, clearly proportion happens much lower,‚Äù Razani said. added: ‚ÄúIf going beach ‚Äî beautiful thing ‚Äî avoid times it‚Äôs crowded, mask, Plan B.‚Äù Yep really held higher standard nurses. time something goes wrong always run right back attending point fingers. 0 accountability profession coming someone worked physician multiple states multiple hospital systems. personally seen nurses get reamed things wrong. really know seem believe graduate masters degree nursing suddenly nurse become psedodoctor.

I tell spend least 30 minutes day correcting NPs orders make sense clearly shows lack education receive. intended scut work physicians nothing else. Same. Social pressure helluva drug. getting downvoted? It‚Äôs truth.

Anyone says posting prediction deserves downvoted. Washington state re-instating restrictions certain counties due rising cases, that's worth. I'm pretty sure Israel everyone beat. 

However start talking countries hundreds millions people can't name one better US. No, argument ""it infringing rights"" sufficient argument itself. already displayed willingness wear fabric parts body society / government's behest, refuse additional one (ie: mask) incumbent upon person make better, coherent argument. People listen public statements key Dr. Fauci says time traveling‚Äîeven vaccinated. could still carrying virus nose, including transmissible variants, spread it. Dr. Rochelle Walensky, Director Centers Disease Control Prevention, said two words sum up: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt travel,‚Äù told JAMA. do, could end spreading COVID-19 variants. ‚ÄúI mean, learned one thing MMWR (that‚Äôs Morbidity Mortality Weekly Report) Minnesota, experience B117 variant, several came California. travel California. really, really would advocate traveling right now.‚Äù

IIRC statements within past month. one going scouring CDC website dude. one going attempting reconcile CDC website language something hit headline Fauci Walensky. messaging confusing disjointed. understandable science changes, need make **very clear** public has. Ending AZ completely Netherlands give 1-2 week delay. due small expected deliveries. Due delivery failures EU it‚Äôs replaceable vaccine exponential growth. next million cases probably take couple days  Scary hypothetical mutation boogyman.  amazing number people personally know getting vaccine say....oh need get job fly plane go concert I'll get it. Jesus self serving. 12 59 20% believe that's did. 

You less 1% chance happening 20% chance fatal happen. know numbers given, appointments still really, really hard find Indiana based Even rural parts state almost completely full.

In comparison, places like appointments available state.

I would wait appointments full anymore sounding alarm bells. think that's it. That's California. feel bad too, fuck government. They're fucking reason situation bad country. Letting Kumbh mela continue, holding rallies West Bengal, blaming everything states politicising issues main reasons suffering badly; that's ignoring oxygen shortages, full hospitals, fake numbers govt peddling. even though year prepare second wave, done enough. 

Initially happy strict lockdown govt did, everything post less joke. 

We need help get, looks it, getting votes important getting help chance related large uncontrolled outbreak Ontario? miss it? know vaccine even good? Several family vaccines abandoned low efficacy. 

mRNA seems vaccine wars. Next area competition best booster cover known variants fall winter. don‚Äôt need taught thanks much :) catch asymptomatic? get tested randomly happened catch it?

But seriously it‚Äôs awesome none major symptoms (or symptoms case!) Thanks! Thankfully I‚Äôm careless flossing :) Part problem really know exact rate age group clotting problems occurring. 20 something man *may* lower chances dying covid, 20 something woman *may* not. think next couple weeks may start get better understanding exactly risk, hard way unfortunately. 

There's also aspect control. Maybe men women lower chances clots dying covid, individuals level control risk getting covid. take vaccine true complete roll dice, terrible waiting game. There's also better chances survival covid, compared clotting disorder (despite lower chances developing disorder). 

In US, two effective, widely available alternatives risk complication. us, seems easy younger person simply wait get access mRNA vaccine. 

Considering developing situation, treated prudunce caution. justification think vaccination rate low. could everyone eligible year vax rate like 10% something opening foolish asking massive outbreak. vax rate high case counts falling there's reason lift restrictions including masks. Apparently really need start using /s 

Thought quotes would it; guess not. Wait, second dose isn‚Äôt already scheduled, even it‚Äôs farther date recommended time frame? 

You get first dose send say good luck finding second dose? mean way get second dose faster? Viral vector vaccines also pretty new. used Ebola vaccines far know. lockdowns prevent spread; delay it. really. People move out. 

Now ADX Florence another story. might safest place world pandemic. take social distancing whole new level. day walk dog wear mask night much quieter might chin pull fast need 

That's exactly do. Turns lost filling turned emergency root canal today. Fun fun. women. Curious. aggravated see media types like Joy Reid saying vaccinated people ‚Äúirrational‚Äù don‚Äôt wear mask saying going double mask isolate even though fully vaccinated. 

Just COVID theater demonstrates lack understanding science especially recent studies show vaccinated people don‚Äôt spread virus. Exactly. treatment like flu. ""Take within 2 days symptoms lessen covid"" He's anti vaxer looking valid excuse. 3 months comes NY, put something back said travel quarantine 3 months getting vaccine. states, like NY put insanely cautious guidelines, really harm feeding bullshit like this. worry, even managed convince almost scientists think vaccine last years, he'll fall back onto ""it's fully approved FDA"". get fully approved FDA, he'll say side effects worth find excuse. cumulative. spend day around people, even different people, add up. 

Yes, much safer thing indoors. live really crowded place, makes sense mask on. like big burden anyway. recommends fully vaccinated people travel low risk themselves""


I really feel like lot "" guidance showing optimism"" baloney people bother actually read guidances... US export ban. little idea happening ingredients beyond knowing they're exported. Yeah scary news articles gets clicks. tipping point always expected around now, vaccine outreach would important enough supply. ends successfully suppressed Covid. kid otherwise. study small &amp; limited study. 

Oxford Vaccine Group, Department Paediatrics, University Oxford, UK involved different study. two-dose regimen ChAdOx1-nCoV19 show protection mild-moderate Covid-19 due B.1.351 variant, however, severe Covid-19 Funded Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation South African Medical Research Council; ClinicalTrails.gov number, NCT04444674). Exactly.! Tuesday higher rest week. understanding, Whitmers hands literally tied stripped authority make public health rules legislature. using health department orders that, head fired replaced legislature won‚Äôt use authority make rules. yeah, don‚Äôt really know want do. She‚Äôs lost power concerning COVID. Lol ok. Ohhh, burn someone can‚Äôt even spell ‚Äúirrelevant‚Äù. still higher chance getting blood clot Covid 1 shot AZ vaccine getting blood clot AZ vaccine itself. problem still numerous restrictions place limit social activity travel.

The risk vaccinated person unvaccinated person, including risk credibly spreading others. able help assess risks far properly reading research plan accordingly.

I say someone wearing KN95 airport, fully vaccinated type this. Getting shot helped remove restrictions, people willing honest differences help encourage uptake. start pushing message quickly, hit threshold needed save lives time. Problem India large population. honestly know going stop spread there. need much resources. insane. Sending vibes family 2 weeks feeling ill, 4 weeks me.

I can't make guarantees know you, age.

I hope mild case, get better soon! article sheds light little spread outdoors, says it‚Äôs known year (as many us known). *why* theatrical mandates? Ridiculous. EU export vaccine love people world. strategy attracts vaccine manufacturers. 

Russia, China, India exports vaccine geopolitical reasons, true bullies here. Well, country recently allowed massive religious gatherings celebrations, didn‚Äôt help matters. never really avoided outbreak Covid, start year India 10 million ‚Äúconfirmed‚Äù Covid cases, know dubious official cases be. however keep healthcare system relatively check, starting fall apart. Really, India needed/needs vaccines, thats best way mitigate spread virus long term. San Francisco workday, mass gathering. impossible distance. What's happening India right give idea pandemic would 'end' (in West) vaccines, rich enough physically distance ourselves. keep mind herd immunity parts, people got vaccinated people got sick. get 70% people vaccinated 85% herd immunity still reached half remainder gotten illness retained sufficient antibodies. official border crossing needs, wonder require US crossers show proof vaccination, antibody test showing past infection. that's got half country, impossible locate safe truck drivers etc.

As far locals leaking back forth across border...I doubt much that. What? U.S. doesn‚Äôt enough vaccines stockpiled vaccinate whole country. people think this? somewhere around 270m vaccines shipped 213m (plus likely bit more) already administered. sure something different shots vs flu shot nurses day good at.

It's definitely nurses good it. first shot feel needle all, second shot nurse definitely less skilled felt go little bit angle, stung bit more. bit mental fog kind body high type feeling nothing else. 1st shot worse me, still totally manageable. start. fully vaccinated 40 pooping bricks thinking getting airplane summer first time nearly two years. CDC reassuring would help morally. We'll need therapy PTSD well ""get back normal"". Yeah remember though mRNA vaccine production. Mathematicians invent new function describe number cases India \+1. ones family shot #1 side effects cousins already covid. number risk getting blood clot. risk dying one much, much lower (especially doctors watching it), nearly deaths also occurred older people. also firm grasp long-term impacts COVID young, whereas long-term effects blood clot resolved basically nil. thanks! added good point. 

Walking around middle San Francisco middle day means constantly near people. much different lonely hiking trail mountains. consensus pandemic ends, end.

everything ends eventually, meaningless statement. So, careful using word ‚Äúlive‚Äù ‚Äúvirus‚Äù. ‚ÄúLive‚Äù reference virus means it‚Äôs capable replicating, like electrical socket ‚Äúlive‚Äù. Virus not, *alive* *dead*, *live* *inactivate*. also use term ‚Äúkilled‚Äù distinguish ‚Äúattenuated‚Äù viruses, *are* live longer infect (but might still infect something else), longer reproduce effectively.

Types vaccines think off-hand are:
* mRNA
  * Messenger RNA codes spike protein riding fatty acids get delivered cells injection site, produce protein immune system freaks starts attacking it; means attack *specific* spike proteins future, including viruses
* Vector viruses
  * Adenoviruses ones use; deliver DNA cells make produce spike protein, similar net result mRNA
* Attenuated organism
  * viruses ‚Äúkilled‚Äù, deliberately mutated denatured become largely harmless, unable infect you, etc.; equivalent tying hostile enemy using target practice
* ‚ÄúKilled‚Äù vaccine
  * viruses ‚Äúlive‚Äù (active) deactivated, longer infect cells; attenuated vaccines tying enemy combatant using target practice, rounding dead enemy combatants using *corpses* target practice
* Conjugate vaccines
  * vaccines don‚Äôt contain viruses/bacteria, instead use something use ‚Äì following enemy combatant simile, would like dressing dummy actual clothes/armor/whatever enemy combatants using target practice
* Toxoid vaccines
  * Contains dangerous toxins produced organism, allowing body‚Äôs immune system target that, get infected, renders organism harmless; think Princess Bride poisoned goblets, someone survived many poisonous bites harmed (or harmed) bites time goes on

Currently, Pfizer Moderna type 1, J&amp;J AZ type 2, Covaxin type 4.

Attenuated organisms usually effective vaccines, IIRC, it‚Äôs looking like mRNA might take cake. take lot different trials, applications, types, diseases see well vector vaccines stack outside COVID.

As far vaccines go, Covaxin ‚Äúold school‚Äù. AZ J&amp;J use vector vaccines, studied (particularly vs. HIV), actually approved use (vs. Ebola).

Really glad see mRNA working well, hope we‚Äôll see applications biotech future.

Some general information distinction re: live/alive:

A virus falls two categories:
* Genetic material surrounded protein coat (capsid)
* Genetic material surrounded protein coat (capsid) partial complete layer lipids/fatty acids (envelope)

Genetic material DNA RNA, depends virus.

That‚Äôs it. There‚Äôs ‚Äúlife‚Äù them, aren‚Äôt actually alive ‚Äì there‚Äôs activity bang cell infect, inject genetic material cell, overrides cell function (immediately future point time, e.g. HIV reservoir cells) makes begin producing new viruses.

Honestly, best comparison IMHO they‚Äôre basically little robots, built DNA/RNA proteins ‚Äì occasionally wearing skins victims, too, since that‚Äôs lipid envelope (cell membrane host cell ruptures release virus). Need least another 2 months. We‚Äôll get there. Well certainly way tell, access it. states information passports could created, various reasons. said ""safest"" thing may may ""safest"" long term. incentivize people enough, might end much higher vaccine uptake mid term. really need know audience. got better! got 2nd shot!

Yay!

Its weird felt first one one even know got :)

I mild first dose, hope mild second dose, even though already covid. situation know worried it.

I spent weekend town friends &amp; family (everyone fully vaxed one shot in). found yesterday friend's (two weeks post dose 1 pfizer) boss postive, even though boss fully vaccinated. small company &amp; wear masks office. friend around boss Wednesday - Friday, us weekend. 

My gut reaction odds low friend infected boss even lower friend tests positive, infectious weekend. Wow, got appt tomorrow thru walmart. Wtf, thank u much /u/zaidswith read, US doesn‚Äôt even enough bags. facilities started reusing supposed single use materials. thanks much! added :) heard compulsory travel vaccination? It‚Äôs new.

Of course. I've Yellow Fever, Hep B many vaccines it.

There's huge difference requiring annual vaccinations though. Like said, we'll lucky get 80% now. We're going convince 80% people get vaccine every year.

Not sure point smallpox. smallpox vaccine (despite traveling developing world) suspect either. smallpox virus mutate quickly, able eradicate it. Makes sense, agree. US needs use wealth help rest world vaccinate we're going keep dealing forever. Love that. I'm getting Moderna #2 Friday I'm lowkey nervous side effects. (not enough make get course, mile, nevertheless) WI, ND, SD, MT, NE, IA, IL, OH, IN, WY, ID...northern states similar worse climates MI, much better according map article. matter could include states climate still heading south appealing many spring (KY, WV, MO, etc.)

Spring travel could factor, hard say whether main factor even significant one without detailed data. Take moment put shoes someone live uber-wealthy first world country. remember everyone Germany got Pfizer/Moderna AZ J&amp;J remained shelf, would still pandemic raging elsewhere, variant avoid Pfizer/Moderna vaccine arrive absolute inevitability. 2nd dose Pfizer in. still can't get feel needle all. sure something different shots vs flu shot nurses day good at.

Final ""just wait 2 weeks"" political rallies hosted Prime Minister Home Minister paying off. me, pretty crummy, far ""terrible"" anything. E.g., nearly bad flus I've recall lasted night day after. Woke next day feeling fine. Can't compare island nation population bigger metro area Europe North America. true. Ah, agreement then.
I misread statement USA would fault. India too? ""reported"" higher. Yes U.K. approved Monocolonial antibodies expensive produce highly doubt everyone tests positive U.S. receives treatment. contrast, pills intended sent anyone positive test U.K. Also requiring hospital visit administer treatment huge deal. Wish we‚Äôd Germany feel like COVID exposed weaknesses Western nations' roots classical liberalism individualism far social cohesion battling common threat.

I think combination influences classical liberalism, accelerating political polarization, internet providing safe space every opinion rather broadcasting scientific societal consensus. began, friend Walgreens told cannot wear mask work gave bad image. 

""If wear mask people think sick vulnerable may shop here."" like watching first date someone react treat someone 
 like server restaurant, year slow motion. litmus test friend group, holy fuck. thoughts go direction. AZ sold vaccines US US can‚Äôt unilaterally gift resell them. means AZ essentially gets take second bite apple sell again. Maybe US wants countries reimburse whatever paid initially, perhaps AZ also wants additional payment. sensitive three-way negotiation could lead ugly headlines.  Oh, definitely virtue signaling. well off, left leaning privileged people love wearing masks public giving looks disapproval us wear masks outdoors. Wow pretty epic, +1 reddit gold zinger subzero iq neanderthal resentment moved past people think need tighten restrictions even vaccines. That‚Äôs whole point vaccine, get back normal. Research every field? Sounds like need research yourself. vaccinated means keep wearing mask, keep distancing, keep dealing restrictions.

I hear time either way, still health restrictions. Skipping shot doesnt invalidate guidelines, sort pointless rebellion light. incentive getting shot planet returns way much sooner. I'm elated US seen major reversal covid trend, many places still thick long road ahead. Sure, would imply parties want change one part distribution reason.

Since already started guessing, here's attempt explaining AZ might fault:

Since negotiations (in current understanding) held secret, guess current state, AZ wants money changed contract, EU deals getting extended they're holding destribution clause hostage? That's good. wish efficacy better. Massachusetts requires one times outdoors. Even you‚Äôre going grab mail... obviously one goes extreme, I‚Äôve witnessed people walking alone one around wearing mask. chalk equivalent wearing one car alone. Centre Cellular Molecular Biology (CCMB), forefront sequencing SARS-CoV-2 genome, culture double mutant strain B.1.617 variants concern check antibodies vaccinated recovered persons neutralise virus. ‚ÄúIt take least 10 days process,‚Äù Dr Rakesh Mishra, director CCMB, told Indian Mishra said population study, someone‚Äôs antibodies put cell culture virus unable infect it, would mean vaccine worked. exercise particularly significant India opens vaccination aged 18 May report Ministry Health Family Welfare Tuesday, 20,000 cases reported January 1, country reported almost 10 times number cases (over two lakh) daily since April Mishra said whichever variant state, spread depended lack Covid-appropriate behaviour. multiple variants location, one spread would become dominant and, among existing variants Maharashtra, double mutation ‚Äî E484Q L452R ‚Äî efficient, monitoring much variant spreading process collecting 5 per cent samples state see worse better places. may may dangerous, spreading fast bad sign; needs urgently contained want dangerous version virus,‚Äù Mishra said scientists also monitoring hospital deaths due particular variant and, hence, important culture variants. ‚ÄúTesting vaccinated people‚Äôs sera infection help us understand prevents growth virus,‚Äù added. borders countries closed travel limited pandemic. expect much. ""not willing stop lives forever""

You mean ones die. It‚Äôs likely export ban removed soon realise India needs vaccine materials run soon. 

Otherwise US killed lot people. sure tbh. 28 day check mentioned struggling get trialists due big drop cases UK. may look European countries extend trial. yet people still pissing moaning fast enough. I'm going lie, I'm nervous getting vaccine. I'm anti-vaxx guy, attempting persuade others get it. I'm 110% going get next month. I'm nervous side effects people it. unnecessary fear get vaccine, I'll one rare cases death. :( Came say this. New Zealand country either. 

And variants tons deaths otherwise. 

The idea responsibly handling virus business economy still running/mental health mutually exclusive. side. 

Countries handled better cooperated better economies less mental health issues much less deaths. Deaths trailing metric also don‚Äôt consider complications (like COVID long haulers). would CDC withhold information though regardless it‚Äôs hard enforce? messaging terrible would harp return normalcy reason vaccination would lot effective. Probably bed icing massive injury already diminutive credibility. miss pompous face his. So, two points:

**One:** Yes, agree, *but* always find kind argument somewhat short-sighted, insofar views vacuum. ‚Äúproblem‚Äù ‚Äúreducing SEVERE COVID mild/asymptomatic infection‚Äù **definitely** saves lives right now, *may* reduce spread, also creates environment dangerous mutations selected ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt take many people vaccinated, get infected, **AND** develop mutated strain evades current immune defense built current vaccines reboot entire pandemic back day one.

Note, emphasize ‚Äúand‚Äù three need occur together, reducing spread via percentage population immunity mitigate (but remove) risk this, yeah: people vaccinated (who also immune response) still get infected *does* create environment selects strains evade immune system‚Äôs current antibodies. Meaning, someone COVID body randomly mutates spike protein (all?) vaccines target ‚Äì way largely ignored antibodies vaccines produce ‚Äì we‚Äôre back square one. Well, square one half so, since know Pfizer Moderna highly effective becomes matter swapping mRNA another codes new protein.

Mind, 70% total immunity 100% protection vs. severe immunity metric **fuck ton** better nothing, better vaccines preventing *any* infection, effective mitigating risk strains evade immune defenses.

**Two:** therein lies rub, one hinted claim, (emphasis mine): ‚Äúif catch COVID *but don‚Äôt chance transmit it* don‚Äôt die we‚Äôre going lower overall ... transmission, ... mortality rate, etc.‚Äù

That requires lot self-control people have. Nobody going know mild cold mild case COVID, don‚Äôt know someone mild case vaccinated (with immune response) *definitely* spread (or *cannot* spread it), seems likely (infection implies virus replicating system).

After horrific social experiment we‚Äôve seen play last year change, dollars donuts, **many** people aren‚Äôt going stay home mild sniffles cough ‚Äì lesson learned *without* vaccine, never mind belief immunity *with* vaccine.

And that‚Äôs shit scares still. I‚Äôve definitely fucked isolation stress last year, I‚Äôll dealing while, can‚Äôt escape impending dread combination of: vaccines less effective preventing COVID infection, people giving entirely cautious symptoms, put us back months year dealing this. Typical main stream media. headline touts great progress daily vax rate, include graph shows rate taken significant nose dive last week. point mentioning facts counter message.

Curious decline coincides opening entire country everyone eligibility. think would make rate climb higher. Hopefully fluke spring back positive slope like big winter storm. There's already 100 million aquired doses delivered September. THIS!!! guarantee happens around April 30. That‚Äôs first 100 days administration done. already paved way recent briefing trumpeting effective vaccines are. Overly Cautious tone transition becomes cool relax restrictions since 1. first 100 days 2. Cases decline (they already starting) due 50% adults first dose/natural immunity/seasonality (also Michigan peaked, helps). Jesus Christ.

Did know drinking water isn‚Äôt 100% risk free either? goes absolutely everything. fear phobia. Seek therapy. enforced though, jog around neighborhood days, never wear mask, one said done anything it. remind one day end, one way another. Somedays see falling amount vaccine demand think, thing ever fucking end? thanks reminding eventually. outweigh benefit vaccinated? You‚Äôre looking bigger picture. 

To take extreme, let‚Äôs cancel doses AZ wait supply chain MRNA alternatives ramp up.

Walk math please. What‚Äôs prediction model either scenario? say like people actually started things. area seems like one even aware pandemic happening. Someone said spike protein , vaccine work . I'm somewhere camp, slowly leaving it. I'm fully vaccinated tomorrow, I've wearing masks outside keeping space people year now. 

It's tough habit shake, know I'll get next weeks/months know intellectually silly. emotions/anxiety make tough. 

Hopefully compassion people fade speed. intentional sure still big problem media channels. [Here's brain trust telling us supply/demand tipping point super concerning, keep scrolling hit next article, change behavior vaccine. Dude said 100 days masking. think it'd smart mark 100 days reduced restrictions benchmarks eliminating restrictions. FOLLOW LEAD PHILLY one asking American vaccines, they're asking America allow private companies fill existing paid orders, instead de facto export ban get away they're biggest richest kid block. Except quite true. CDC said fully vaccinated gather fully vaccinated people. also dont need quarantine exposed infected person. two big changes announced like month ago.

I'm worried apathy. people sort serious risk want put effort scheduling two appointments driving getting ride *somewhere* get vaccine. would they? They'll still told wear mask keep distance, still able normal lives. They'll told virus profoundly small chance harming even smaller chance harming them.

The government needs start addressing apathy directly something better ""Do told."" doses. They're free. They're pharmacies. issue people caring much, even something small saying ""There's medical reason vaccinated people wear mask"" would go long way.

Obviously would people lie vaccinated, God damn, simply care all. get sense people willing *lie* avoid vaccination either never getting vaccinated already infected- Probably lot cases Within weeks adults fully vaccinated, CDC said vaccination dramatically reduces chance spreading virus. We're approaching point majority people medical reason wear mask. Basing policy messaging around would go long way combat ""Why bother"" attitude that's predictably become common. either first dose 2nd dose. find open 1st dose appointments, wont let confirm date without 2nd dose date appointment, can't find of. live Phoenix, theres tons ppl trying get shots.

If vaccines 90% effective, exposure risk 10X higher (e.g., New Mexico versus Michigan), relative risk same. That's exactly said, exactly article linked says. 

It completely incorrect say ""your chance getting COVID .04%"". First, data citing incomplete. CDC's breakthrough data incomplete requires voluntary reporting. starting industrialized testing centers testing data. Secondly, timebound risk (which efficacy *is not*). Every day passes (while case load exists) increase number people infected. 

An individual's chance getting infected still dependent upon exposure risk. non-vaccinated exposure risk month 10% (i.e. 10% chance catching COVID before), vaccines lower absolute risk experiencing symptoms .5-1%. 

It *safer* highly vaccinated, low case load population unvaccinated vaccinated high exposure risk area. example, vaccinated measles low measles vaccination community, likely get measles unvaccinated person lives area high vaccination. Exposure risk mitigated efficacy, exposure risk 100X higher, even 95% effectiveness means risk still 5X higher.

Hopefully happens sooner! India‚Äôs Health System Cracks Strain Coronavirus Cases Surge

At least 22 people died loss oxygen hospital accident. Infections hit daily record. government faced criticism allowing enormous Hindu festival continue.

NEW DELHI ‚Äî India‚Äôs health care system shows signs buckling strain second wave coronavirus infections, authorities reported nearly 300,000 new cases Wednesday accident Covid-19 hospital killed 20 people.

The accident happened hospital western state Maharashtra leak hospital‚Äôs main oxygen tank stopped flow oxygen dozens critically ill people. Televised images showed family members wailing wards nurses frantically pounding chests patients.

All week, hospitals across India warning acute oxygen shortage. Many hospital officials said hours away running out.

‚ÄúNobody imagined would happen,‚Äù said Subhash Salunke, medical adviser Maharashtra government.

India home world‚Äôs fastest-growing Covid-19 crisis, reporting 294,000 new infections Wednesday 2,000 deaths. supplies hospital beds, oxygen vaccines run low, criticism government building.

In televised address Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged people careful said lockdowns last resort. States cities increasingly going lockdown own, critics say government‚Äôs mixed messages making matters worse.

As examples, point recent political rallies held Mr. Modi drawn thousands, well government‚Äôs decision allow enormous Hindu festival continue despite signs become superspreader event. days ago, Mr. Modi indicated wanted Hindu worshipers stay away year‚Äôs festival, called Kumbh Mela, held banks Ganges river considered sacred many Hindus.

But worshipers keep coming ‚Äî 70,000 showed Wednesday holy dip, bringing total 10 million since festival began January ‚Äî government officials ground little stop them.

Event organizers said worshipers required produce negative coronavirus test result tested spot, also acknowledged huge crowds, participants could slipped without tested. Photographs show sea worshipers packed together gray waters river, many without masks. 1,000 tested positive site 48 hours, according reports Indian news media.

Nasty Astra's J&amp;J's vaccine mortality rate extremy low are, people fucking selfish. drugs/medicine least deadly? People probably thinking get Covid, also able prevent getting shot. Completely leaving infecting others account.


I'm happy parents got Astra vaccine week, neighbors got put IC yesterday. eligible vaccine sensational news headlines scared them. Transparency good thing, fearmongering going right also lot damage. people's fault getting sick 99.9% cases. Covid cannot solved personal responsibility. Yeah think they've hit top surge really wanted help would lifted export restrictions easier manufacturers India produce large quantities supplied developing countries.

Instead, press secretary white house avoided question gave non answers asked directly. Whats technology used vaccine? (more similar J&amp;J, AZ Moderna &amp; Pfizer?) live city unusual. Especially go around corner, pass doorways alleys can‚Äôt really anticipate person walking out. day walk dog wear mask night much quieter might chin pull fast need *They since recovered given stroke treatments blood clots found.* 

*Brain scans six women showed normal results suggest stroke, irregularities found vaccine batch six doses originated, Kulkanya said.* 

So big nothingburger inactivated vaccines. bit funny give stroke treatments without even investigations though. There's one another Germany, 59 cases sinus cerebral vein thrombosis reported mid-April vaccination AstraZeneca's Corona vaccine. reported Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI) homepage. affected vaccinated 13 February 31 March.

59 cases roughly 4.2 Millionen jabs absurdly high number Chile already plateauing cases I'm gonna bet cases going start dropping end April predicted since Israel started continual case decline hit 68 doses per 100 people, Chile achieved. UK's results actually impressive Israel's whatever reason. Chile put ton it; efficacy Sinovac ramps enormously second dose works well. messaging starting flip encouraging people get shots. think we'll see campaign kick high gear next month.

Expect see PSAs talking importance getting shot, community outreach (including mobile vaccine vans, home visits, etc.). idea get apathetic shots.

It's time concerned yet, need see 2-3 months. point that's left (hopefully) folks outright refusing. Results already available!

‚ÄúResults United Kingdom study showed Novavax vaccine 96% effective original virus, 86% UK variant 60% South African variant. Thirty-thousand people enrolled US/Mexico clinical trial.‚Äù

It‚Äôs regulatory approval processes want know! Got first shot yesterday. symptoms whatsoever, arm isn‚Äôt bad Thank you! really appreciate it. No, think Pandemics end, even without vaccines. everyone/most people it, everyone amount immunity. spread easily, deadly. Covid disappear, people continue getting forever, it'll another routine illness like flu rsv. us entering transfer portal. soon gather data, analyse come reasonable conclusion. confirmed Dr. Krishna ella Bharat biotech today. keep drinking ‚Äòatma nirbhar‚Äô koolaid. EU exported 39.2 million doses Japan Jan 31 Apr 13, actually used. 67% according huge real world study Chile recently. Right. commenting things like restrictions? would like asking mechanic comment whether heart surgery not.  That‚Äôs simply late! That's great, hopefully approved UK soon since production already started others said COVID animal reservoirs, elimination like smallpox feasible. Smallpox affected humans, worldwide vaccination campaign able wipe out. small pox able infect bats, like COVID can, would still there.

For reason, zero COVID realistic goal, opinion. Instead, shoot high vaccination rates prevents large outbreaks. high vaccination rates also lower severity disease most, fall background common respiratory viruses there. So, think endgame relegating COVID endemic respiratory virus rarely think population immunity high enough limit severe illness. Thank you. informative. Can't wait get second jab... It‚Äôs really bizarre. I‚Äôm trying picture teeth must look like üò¨ think generally 10-15 hours. got mine 5pm woke ‚Äúhangover‚Äù next day Technically ordinance county reads ""masks required public place"".

I try understand logic, can't. someone scared dying vaccine, virus? one better other? read article someone posted (as well articles) regarding Prozac possibly benefits Covid anti-inflammatory properties.

My question is, covid vaccine effective people Prozac anti-inflammation properties? Similar told avoid taking advil covid shot since could reduce effectiveness? I'm sure point here. Mayor control mask mandate hints end-time irrelevant.

He's overruled time time numerous reopening actions mandates already. this. don‚Äôt know exposed. got vaccinated 2 months ago, never got exposed that, 12 months pandemic. Im mid 20s, good health, anti vax rush get it. risk family members double vaxxed getting wasnt big concern me. thennnn new york decided mandate negative tests vaccine proof go baseball games. figured would become norm concerts, events etc made sign get vax. havent gotten flu shot decade. wasnt going get negative test every time wanted go event, getting vax changed mind. disagree direction NY going mandating tests/vax proof things, feel choice go youre willing take risk (same goes others go vaccinated coming contact arent) but, think so, itll get people age, similar situations get vax werent originally planning Yeah. see comments acknowledging things blame.

The whole world sniggering US Trump. literal joke. like movie Idiocracy come life. one friend owe another pull aside let know ""your girlfriend fucking another dude"" etc. make world. pointing results.

1) Might good read CDC international travel guidelines. Poland‚Äôs vaccine rate starting accelerate think gov still thinks won‚Äôt hit people end august. probably feel similar going US wedding April 1st? know safety measures follow?

1) part wedding party? it‚Äôs probably easier come excuse.

2) Chat boss it?

3) Maybe suggest throw local party well. could make sweet offering pay. Im sure friends can‚Äôt afford travel Poland would great include well. Oooo VAP!?

From article. lawmakers one. Where‚Äôs data Chinese? India (some cities) one - friend keeping loop curfews lockdowns high community spread there. correct take imo Yeah, also thing needs done get need be. improvement layer. heck live people act like that? That‚Äôs annoying.

Texas highest number people MLMs per capita. wondering Pearson's r correlation coefficient would be. guess undefined, no? SD would zero, numerator would also reduce zero. Division zero undefined. Thanks brain exercises, Reddit! What? Also vaccinated Florida woman. Another reason wear mask company policy. worked retail years there‚Äôs reason make service worker‚Äôs job harder fighting them. 

I switch blue disposable though. Makes others comfortable much comfortable wearing. It‚Äôs choice year ‚Äústolen‚Äù you. I‚Äôm thankful didn‚Äôt stick head ass year stay home nothing. Honestly, last 6 months best months life. hang friends time, go bars time, going gym 4x week, see family time it‚Äôs wonderful covid last March got shot pretty severe side effects lasted 24-36 hrs done. glad got J&amp;J though anything else would gone back second jab given bad first one was. 100% also hospitalization death write explicitly. Death risk reduction like #1 efficacy endpoint. think interim results Phase 3 trial, full data released get around 300 (I sure exact number) infections trial.

However, already approved India doubt would exporting vaccine anytime soon manufacturer struggling keep demand locally. also manufacturing standards might Western standards there's too. Could honestly see indoor mask mandate ending sometime summer too. ~55% antibody tests coming back positive lately 40% city's population already least partially vaccinated, expect cases absolutely plummet next month. 7 day average confirmed + probable cases fell low 250 last summer, community protection fraction now. could realistically see cases fall sub-50 per day time around. think mean would hypocritical ban AstraZeneca allow J&amp;J, thought problem blood clots.  would incompetent ban due low incidence blood clots leaving country limited vaccine options.

The thing country detailed data people get infected. Yes, numbers highly incomplete inaccurate, specially countries numbers got high. 

So it‚Äôs really possible rules based data require. know fundamentals people gathering mingling high risk scenarios try make rules avoid that. 

Also since one rule isn‚Äôt done isolated it‚Äôs possible draw conclusions ‚Äúits working‚Äú not. don‚Äôt know cases would double curfews weren‚Äôt implemented.

This easy it‚Äôs pc game see numbers, adjust, roll back, try again... Meanwhile country, according social media posts people believe conspiracy, 'praying' away virus. 

The Brazil variant found days ago. factor 5 ""just bad""? even pulling IFR from? Perhaps India gone back complete normal 10 months ago? Irresponsible. thinking vaccines started rolled worldwide effort vaccinate everyone age 75 soon possible move younger/healthier populations goal mostly met.

Is case? seems pretty universal countries I've looked at. I'm Colombia vacation they're way could avoid extremely high death severe illness rates reducing ability virus mutate sickest populations.

Note viruses actually mutate faster populations resistant disease still spreading.

But keeping alive longer still really bad. that's without even taking account 127K deaths mostly older people, mostly big waves incidence much lower.

UPDATE SITUATION - New measures, new reports highlights: update latest developments Covid-19 pandemic around world.

France fallen 33,000 daily cases, clear decrease, "" *fragile* "", Minister Health Olivier V√©ran, evokes territorialized deconfinement.

In United States, soon India, vaccine offered citizens, idea ‚Äã‚Äãa compulsory vaccination passport international travelers.

5,984 people intensive care France

43,098 new cases recorded 24 hours France, according figures Public Health France published Tuesday, 6,696 day 39,113 last Tuesday. test positivity rate 9.8%.

The pressure French resuscitations continues increase. 5,984 patients Covid-19 hospitalized services Tuesday, including 601 people admitted last 24 hours, 5,970 day before. total, hospitals 31,086 people affected Covid-19, including 2,404 admitted 24 hours. 375 people died last 24 hours French hospitals, bringing number hospital deaths 75,413.

Regarding vaccinations, 12,999,655 people received least one injection since start campaign (i.e. 19.4% total population) 4,845,217 people received two injections (i.e. 7.2% total population). total population). last 24 hours, 418,766 people vaccinated: among them, 248,557 received first dose 170,209 second. Thank you. needed hear right now. Everyone survived. stroke. Chill. cases affected overwhelmingly women (45 women vs. 14 men) comes deaths, men equally affected (6 vs. 6). Giving vaccine men suggested sometimes, look like good idea either. Sharing always fun, kids Stomping variants takes general mass vaccination population though, 75+. That's lot vaccines.

It's unfair, rich countries mostly vaccinated supplies flooding poorer ones. don't, would truly failure. literally Fauci said though... article says lot truck drivers (they follow quarantine). Sadly, there's lot that. Buuuuuuuut U.S. getting vaccinated massively, Canada eventually protected.

That also states decided give vaccines canadian truckers.  mean, took look actually can't find experts advising wash goods (other produce, course, covid reasons). imagine *someone* saying it, overwhelming majority experts indicated even March 2020 necessary. thing pushed washing hands, course still good do, also know likely makes little difference virus. Wild speculation: he's afraid needles. German Dutch regulator also published risk assessment AstraZeneca vaccin. German regulator basically said risk vaccination women 55 greater risk Covid. Hence decision give people 60. Dutch advising body said used AstraZeneca younger people would mean 70-90 people would side-effects. 20 would die half would serious mostly lasting health issues. also said use sixties. Worth mentioning context one woman age 35 died Covid Netherlands year now. 
The age split UK still published roundabout way. Saying risk 1.1 100,000 (so 1 90,000) offset risk ending intensive care. British figures updated since published that. European updated figures show worse figures this. Scandinavian countries -with possible exception Sweden- using AstraZeneca time being. Norway four young people died 140,000 vaccinations AstraZeneca. hope figures turn better Johnson vaccin total vaccination effort delayed. sure would go USA without using vaccin. also wonder able enroll enough people separate stage 2 3 trial considering people receiving Covid vaccines moment. may reason propose placebo group well. Quite unfortunate stage 2 3 could combined. 

They would probably need trials outside Canada able enroll enough participants. would go get pcr test today - might get lucky. patronising dehumanising. Oh, risk young death team! Yay science! Nope, thanks. long safer alternatives exist, wait one instead. pretty much experience It‚Äôs reality. can‚Äôt equally effected every death. Yes, nonzero *and* compounds time spend proximity asymptomatic spreaders. 

In crowded urban environment passing near one two people walking around outdoors--at least anymore. plenty crowds outdoors again, state Massachusetts cities like NYC *daily* case rates match worst single day first peak. 

In cities, outdoor masking still makes sense cost/benefit approach. crowded. Sucks burbs rural areas state, also seen sign outdoor mask mandate enforcement outside urban areas. really, even *in* urban areas. mom works department India apparently things bad they‚Äôre mixing dead bodies send funerals simply many. Germany looks heading way based new legislation. current VOCs UK, Brazil, CA, NYC, India, etc., particularly bad outbreak, SA highest number HIV positive cases. Immunocompromised patients ideal hosts virus mutate in. Yes, India's people getting sick dying another Covid wave. I'm sure people happy dying government international good will.  Well accept rules theory don‚Äôt actually follow them, I‚Äôd say haven‚Äôt really accepted them. personally, others you‚Äôre talking about. literally equal IFR. still bad really, least can‚Äôt choose get Covid actually get safer vaccine elsewhere. fucking disaster vaccine Don‚Äôt disagree, it‚Äôs need continue better practices, masks public places, social distancing.. growing global population movement areas planet daily need adopt better standards personal group hygiene worsening spread new global mutations many diseases. Humans need clean act we‚Äôre going massive future issues. Another Floridian here. wear mask required. I've also downgraded usual KN95 grocery shopping light cloth mask. individual businesses drop mandates longer wear mask.  Lmao Canada last country stop looking US world leader. US much protect help Canada government wants help citizens first longer see leader?

Here truth: Canada choice follow US tells do. Death falls ‚Äúsevere‚Äù umbrella friend. I‚Äôve felt like work variants. live county another state finally started see case numbers going vaccines ramped April we‚Äôve back January numbers end sight. Seriously? dangerous obviously hard know sure Everyone countries, many countries that's get infected taking vaccine Oof ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Eight years selected Gov produce vaccines... Epic fail. Also there‚Äôs way tell vaccinated unvaccinated, safe thing treat us weren‚Äôt control. doesn‚Äôt justify outright lying people. Even helped preserve masks, it‚Äôs eroded confidence CDC saying. Recently CDC said can‚Äôt spread getting vaccinated next day said oh wait (even though basically cant). Messaging mess whole time across administrations. got second dose Saturday, also Pfizer. decent amount achiness fatigue 36 hours first one concerned second, symptoms basically same, even bit milder. 100% normal even residual arm ache Monday morning. hear horror stories, forget people reporting side effects something like less half total. TROUBLE guess Brazil variant, contagious likely reinfect mild asymptomatic case before. variant currently blowing Ontario, Michigan nearby, probably came Canada, started spreading Michigan widespread vaccines started fighting back. Hopefully rest country's vaccines kick block spread causes spikes states, seems likely.

Edit: saw reply B.1.1.7, also contagious, maybe one. fuck masks on. I‚Äôm favor huge restrictions forever, don‚Äôt understand ‚Äúcost/benefit analysis‚Äù benefit ‚Äúmy face slightly comfortable‚Äù cost ‚Äúchildren immunocompromised get sick die.‚Äù example data highly incorrect, understand vaccine efficacy works.

You anywhere near 10% chance getting COVID vaccinated. **With mRNA vaccines, approximately Outdoors doesn‚Äôt mean socially distance others. aren‚Äôt distanced, course using mask benefit.

Again, ALTERNATIVE VACCINES EXIST PROBLEM. hard people understand? binary choice get AZ get COVID really wish people would stop making false equivalency. far everybody run production problems ... would awesome one goes smoothly. First all, 7 day average NYS vaccination rate remains fairly robust 200k despite J&amp;J headwinds. Also, city laser focused increasing uptake harder reach communities opening mass vaccination sites increasing walk appointment access. probably need get 55-60% vaccination crisis basically end NYC, seems totally doable current baseline. huge source spread california full lockdown.

Well thank people like az doses help limit spread covid people like could safely choose decline covid disappearing.  Well, look matters binary, still questions enduring protection vaccinations (including risk mutation). overall optimism vaccinations allow pretty much return normal adoption high enough.

As evidence suggesting vaccinated people spread - yes, true, vaccine cuts back 80-90% infections. There's still 10% protected. low vaccine rates still, high community spread - advising people they're totes mc goats safe they're vaxxed would ill advised.

It's late vaccine front. already exported half production currently facing shortages due western countries prioritizing precursors production.

If Michigan could stayed strong little longer vaccines could prevented hit little soon.  anti vaxxer

Strange, rest comment says otherwise. Among larger states, comparable rates time period 201.1 Florida 65.9 Texas.

Totally unsurprising Florida low testing per 100,000 Israel better keep working wall. We‚Äôre gonna need it. Congrats! Vaccine buddies :) Wow. almost like something important happened months ago changed situation people rationally altered position accordingly. exactly seems lie. never production facilities capable producing amounts. AZ needed european facilities end Q1 instead end Q3 2020 produce 40 mil doses total (EU+UK). sold 30 mil doses September mean could produce them. Again: According EU subcontractors AZ shortfalls production EU. AZ never able produce amounts sold. see real CFR looks like without medical support whatsoever.  understand CDC nothing FDA CDC (was both, looked up) putting pause country paid produces it. going ignore especially since EU already paused AZ due blood clots. Dang we're ~40% vaccinated (probably due delayed data) assuming 50% antibodies, puts us around, means overall immunity roughly 70% (assuming half vaccinated people antibodies half unvaccinated people antibodies). Maybe don‚Äôt want home office though. best friend misses buzz hum office life. want optimistic, worried. experts.
The surge see India Wednesday, July 22, 2020 - agreement, U.S. government receive 100 million doses BNT162, COVID-19 vaccine candidate jointly developed Pfizer BioNTech, Pfizer successfully manufactures obtains approval emergency use authorization U.S. Food Drug Administration (FDA).

Liar question remaining blinded. know crossover. Holy hell. Get grip go study immunology. don‚Äôt think good understanding adaptive immune system functions. I‚Äôm getting mine 4.5 hrs! excited barely concentrate work haha! agree, always better approach topic caution rather immediately go angle ""surely something bad happening, look it"". Don‚Äôt sorry. isn‚Äôt setting health policy. setting experts pharmaceuticals medicine?

Conjugate vaccines? fucking good hold expiring vaccines storage? literally intention approve Astra Zeneca holding enough doses completely immunize Canada. expiry dates May.

I say, first time, point US went ""America First"" ""America Only"", totally unclear thinks beneficial. live UK, many family 20 mile drives jabs; could alternatively waited another 6 weeks closer appointment...but bother? Who's worried hour's worth driving? downvoted whining downvotes. Also, maybe try framing opinions fact clearly aren't. Wednesday, July 22, 2020 - U.S. government pay companies $1.95 billion upon receipt first 100 million doses, following FDA authorization approval. U.S. government also acquire additional 500 million Wednesday, September 09, 2020 - Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX) today announced concluded exploratory talks European Commission proposed supply 200 million doses investigational BNT162 mRNA-based vaccine candidate SARS-CoV-2 European Union (EU) Member States, option 100 million doses. 

Liar beginning trial looking symptoms injection. data 2/3 given vaccination compare 1/3 got placebo designed study.

The 2nd part research checking antibody levels periodically next 2 years (or do) ifentifying breakthrough Covid infection measure viral load nose swabbing infected vaccinated get info it‚Äôs even possible spread Covid vaccinated. I‚Äôm primates, showed little virus nose - need observe humans. vaccinating last 1/3 trial participants, data regards.

We already know vaccinated people going get Covid exposed. vaccinating (or unblind get approved vaccine) give us pertinent information first round shots given side effects measured. Plus wants extra unvaccinated people walking around otherwise able get it.

All data symptom parts clinical - temperature, positive Covid, antibody levels blood. data isn‚Äôt subjective like symptom reporting first 11 days vaccination. Israel Britain reached ""effective herd immunity"" (cases/deaths drastically dropping) ~50% immunized. June 1 seems reasonable: maybe even week two later needed. Here's question I've wondering. know vaccine can't cause someone get infected cases someone got infected vaccine clinic? I've seen run really clean strict. UK first it. Canada already implemented nationwide March though Quebec started January. 90% shots first doses. meant enough vaccines mid-July. first days July every willing adult first dose comes model actually given shots. big difference given shots delivered shots. 

Vaccines get delivered, go quality check couple days. go sort ""emergency stock"" days. go available stock. place found vaccines, delivered stored place used. used. whole process took 3 4 weeks ago, currently brought back 1 2 weeks. 

However, beginning July deliveries limiting factor anymore, waiting second dose given limiting factor.  really like Macron policies general. WILD dragon! symptoms? asking got AZ short ago quite headache rn... understanding coronaviruses mutate rate influenza.

We seeing lot mutations many people infected. virus replicates chance dangerous mutations.

But get control pandemic, think mutations yearly concern. U  firms selling valuable commodity needs met, every reason allow firms sell said commodity countries want (including South Korea).

I see what's scandalous that, fact SK managed far fewer deaths maintaining personal economic freedom countries last year. presumably wouldn't, example, insist nurse come house give Pfizer jab, rather make 20 mile journey get it. So, agree reluctance strange one.

I live America. UK, local GP's walk away, drive away. biggest risk would face going see GP trip drain. I‚Äôm sure good systems place make sure subpar medicine approved. point systems place make sure extremely limited resources wasted/destroyed questionable companies. I‚Äôve got ongoing issues COVID year ago. I‚Äôm pretty pissed Covidiots insist it‚Äôs big deal people don‚Äôt die.  happened us. Sick two weeks. Wife fully vaccinated, seemed unlikely it. Nevertheless, got tested negative. Back getting sick little kids.  true. terraces open mean forced flock them. definitely wait another month even get long awaited cold beer sunny terrace. I'm gonna lie, thought go terrace takes away yearning go :)

Also, teahouses forest, plenty space around. terraces equal. remote worker since 2006. idea separation valid, also possible working remotely. took like solid 2-3 years figure work home. work/life structure never better, takes time get right. people still know handle it. year. poor, even privileged ones can‚Äôt find oxygen tanks. 
This shit dystopian disturbing. Meanwhile Canada..... thankyou get guy internet's housemate's dad's coworker pretty strenuous link, got phone call. exponential numbers India scary that's one thing, things feel real personal connection it. fact got doses scary, yeah can't like extrapolate that, guess driving home vaccination bulletproof individual level. Hopefully population immunity kicking soon. dad coworker doctors vaccinated, also likely exposed. problems first.

That's point...

The UK could around 30 million doses everything went well September last year. took time production optimised now. Hence UK given 40+ million doses, majority AZ. Vaccine production takes time perfect production sites across world improve time. may spread quickly, enters country, would still spread. People still traveled internationally back even without World War involved. You‚Äôre one seems whine, I‚Äôm merely saying truth. better comparison population two states similar climate since temperature huge effect spread. 

March 1 2021:
S Dakota: 13% confirmed, 52% Covid*
Michigan: 6.5% confirmed, 26% Covid

*relies CDC‚Äôs estimate three unconfirmed cases per confirmed poor testing, SD likely closer 60% MI closer 20% back March, speculation without enough available fine-grain data. 

Anyway, vast majority people Dakota socially distance came Covid longer spread virus. significant fraction people Michigan spread disease many gave social isolation Spring vaccine widely available high-transmitters. Hence MI spike infectious variants came United States. 

Hope politics-free fair comparison based proven facts CDC‚Äôs best estimate true extent pandemic. going get lots hate comments might get banned mods, everything factual unbiased get. judging state better, sad Michiganders couldn‚Äôt wait another couple months save grandma. bet there's alot Canada adopted first dose strategy. 25% Canadians received least one dose. 30ish percent eligible population. way vaccinate people fast enough make difference immediate term. Vaccines work.  GP Pfizer, currently stock. I'm reserve list becomes available again. I'll also book appointments vaccine centers become available cancel preferred vaccine available. Well urban (SF LA) areas lower rates rural San Joaquin Valley, I'm guessing last year's infections heavily hit urban areas also keeping rates low. - everything went right UK could around millions doses storage approval. production plants producing UK issues start now, say producing 2 mil week far measly. Hence UK given 40 million doses, majority AZ. Here‚Äôs thing, actually know treat AZ blood clots know look them. anyone else gets AZ vaccine watch symptoms blood clot get ass ER ASAP. Tell doctors got AZ vaccine save life. get Covid might die might live, straight up, can‚Äôt actually treat cute Covid, support patients wait body kill infection. Sometimes works sometimes doesn‚Äôt die. Well plus surge lack infrastructure chances cases even diagnosed.  worry US system finding cases.  whole group fully vaccinated mid-July get first shot beginning July? mean fully vaccinate finish administering first shot group? FDA approved drug biologic production mean company actually *authorized* *produce* drug biologic. FDA inspect license facility production.

Additionally, approved biologic made approved facility, mean company actually *distribute* sell biologic. company run bunch tests every single batch make, test results run past company scientists, test results samples batch sent FDA. *after* FDA's scientists reviewed test results, optionally run sets tests samples, FDA scientists agree test results acceptable, FDA give approval biologic distributed sold.

Source: team wrote systems tracking approval drugs facilities monitoring status different batches drugs.

Please note direct insight what's happening specific plant, know production monitoring systems outside US, assure there's absolutely chance vaccines made plant legally released US. Alright didn‚Äôt know that, thank you! could say vaccine lot targeted could eventually eradicate virus unlike flu? parents anti-vax fun basement buddy company makes Covaxin cannot suddenly make Sputnik V. makes sense produce both. No, we're seeing percent Israel.... Otherwise they're guessing may well say fuck it.

If waiting specific number get vaccinated, a, well can't say without uncivil. Great explanation thank  also believe helping spend 4 years laughing misfortune turn around ask us good neighbor.

OK utter nonsense. front-line COVID nurse Brazil, 70-year-old grandparent South Korea, school teacher variant hotspot India, bunch idiots internet - *most American mind you* - saying?

I think seasonal cold. totally understand could gotten lockdowns everything people tell cold virus remain dormant system months. Anyway, wondering it, get tested. Japan's vaccination program practically non-existent. see graph various countries doing, Japan even graph. infection explosion waiting happen.

Feels bad man... idea that‚Äôs it‚Äôs better no-one perceived benefit receive benefit seems newly dominant U.S. political discourse. see discussions ‚Äúgifted‚Äù programs schools many areas now. Apparently equity requires suffer same. sounds like sour grapes. guess want blame someone, AZ doses US amount one week's supply US, India 4x population. vaccinating rate US would 2 days supply. like owing $100k debt getting mad brother law give $100. yes right way. super slow pre-ordering vaccines use clout bully way front line anyway via export bans.

If fuck something absolutely fix issue whatever means necessary ability to. Especially worst outbreak world nominal lipids mRNA vaccines come EU, UK, Canada.

You're confusing companies produce lipids headquartered production is. several facilities producing lipids US. CordenPharma example plant Colorado. Croda one Alabama US company acquired last year anticipation need. also confuse someone hypocrite issue: I'm also German dual citizen complain EU, Indian, UK export also interesting see thrilled Americans country imposed export ban private companies. guess people suddenly like Communism convenient.

I'm last person would call government intervention export bans Communism. National emergencies call marshaling resources available country worst one country faced since World War 2. also believe helping spend 4 years laughing misfortune turn around ask us good neighbor. it‚Äôs really not. numbers within CI‚Äôs Damn really? thought biggest source would British people swimming across Atlantic. Unfortunately going politicized issue hard get good studies it. seems like lockdowns actually necessary based similar states like Texas California looked, hard present data without conservatives gleefully declaring right along. Sure, US there, ain‚Äôt. People shitting US long ago topic numbers weren‚Äôt even close caught up. People mad country isn‚Äôt helping well US, shitting US last year. It‚Äôs tired annoying point, shows propels think high mighty aren‚Äôt America every bit bad Americans mock. think policy decisions lag conversations medical community...? Got 2nd shot today. covid over? However FDA unlikely approve US unless trials done locally difficult since people getting vaccinated.  I'm trying convince anybody wear one... I'm simply stating think way disagree article's premise.

Have ever tried convince somebody quit smoking quit drinking, religion wrong, world flat, go moon, host conspiracies people believe in?! would try convince people wear mask know mindset?! Good luck that.

I miss point, that's point. Remember Squidward moved Squid village everyone like him? enjoyed clarinet activities, quickly got tiring actually wanted go back Spongebob Patrick.

That's like comes Zoom + exercising home me. analogy, well aware actually declawing cat unethical. mean, look me, else could said, ""Once 60-70% people vaccinated, whatever want. Live like 2019 lick doorknobs care"". kind statement people want.  True, reiterating lots us ready ditch masks. yes, important group people see benefit getting vaccinated restrictions still place. I'm envious pace. think regardless one felt US' export ban initially, there's strong argument made relaxed soon. US starting reach point supply exceeds demand. US producing vaccines faster consume amassed comfortable stockpile (a weeks supply?), think there's defensible reason start exporting surplus countries much greater need. Oh right - bad - confusing two. check product information Janssen one seems using Emergent plant. dumb decision prolong tbh. Thanks! agree, right thing everyone‚Äôs sake. know people don‚Äôt want vaccine tell that‚Äôs choice, may matter time get exposed virus, since it‚Äôs disappearing. They‚Äôre raw dogging pandemic. Since lot vaccine hesitancy seems would make sense use effective vaccines. think lot people forgotten mutations, fact vaccines necessarily work mutations. Getting vaccine end COVID. Amazing civil discussion compared similar proposals states like FL TX. official border crossing needs, wonder require US crossers show proof vaccination, antibody test showing past infection.

 Truckers. Yeah, that's meant disposal. That's going bite us ass line. thought area would back normal June mayor saying need 50 percent vaccinated ditch masks 30 percent little demand vaccines left. case I'm ditching masks memorial day. I'm it. benefit hindsight explain CDC saying can‚Äôt spread vaccinated people walking back next day? 

This problem, messaging based trying illicit certain outcome rather telling truth. doesn‚Äôt work eventually people catch don‚Äôt trust anymore. Combination of:

* generally hit Christmas wave every state was, way due wave
* things relaxed people really starting go more/pandemic fatigue
* B117 variant Oh god, yes see now. quickly went article 2 graphs back mind (which showed China produced exported vaccines planning produce huge amount vaccines year). assumed quickly going article. 

So vaccines Sinovac produced. 260 million total, 156 million exported 104 million use. 100 million vaccines China used must Sinopharm Chinese vaccine manufacturer. Sinopharm exported quite lot well, exact figures that. production vaccine possibly others make rest. No, Catalent Maryland, Emergent Baltimore.  Exactly. Osterholm spent entire pandemic pretending like worst possible outcome also likely outcome. Seems like got little overconfident category 5 Covid hurricane prediction though, screaming rooftops realized wrong. heard since.. Yes will, UK government always put citizens rest world  Ocygen manufacturing plant already? fill-finish? Anything lying around probably already retooled existing vaccines. Sounds like pretty normal progression someone got mild case. I'd assume it. Take test really makes difference act. wouldn't. preach.

I wish would understand this. like masks, concern people hoarding versus getting people wear massive fuck up. 

I feel they're this. Friend mine air right going help parents it. sure people really thought problem there. perfect place spread something like this. hope deal it. friends flying week parents relatives etc. Probably pretty tough situation there. provider low demand states get it, rather mass sites.

Wait, providers aren‚Äôt getting yet? mass sites help get lot people they‚Äôve shipping directly pharmacies quite  Might suggest India Brazil admit numbers already higher thought would be. thought demand would taper 60-65%. Looks like 65+ slowing 80% see big surge age groups starting week.  live UK live rich enough country afford Moderna/Pfizer absolutely completed irrelevant here! also depends state mask mandates though. california talking keeping effect even restrictions dropped, know states planning well. suppose depends person, wife got 2nd day (2 days ago) basically couple hours apart. night started symptoms: Chills, body aches, headaches, hallucinations, basically bad head cold type feeling. Next day aweful haha 3 kids, regretted getting time haha. Day 3, today, im good. Head still little fuzzy, im 10x better. greater cause would much rather Covid day week! prepared worst dont surprises haha whole thing knowing one thing person able judge weird me. Like yeah may wear mask you‚Äôre owner rescue shelter. yeah wear mask beat wife kids. National chains like Target drop mask mandates quite time. They'll drop country-wide avoid patchwork restrictions. people like deserve? catch COVID die? Here‚Äôs really don‚Äôt understand people kin, exactly want? Cases hit 0 forever? that‚Äôs gonna happen. want life like forever everyone closer miserable sad are? Like, what‚Äôs endgame? Because, truthfully, want go dinner friends giant pre production get cocktail pasta... Great source. seen evidence major outbreaks last NFL season allowing limited person fans? numbers hospital admissions deaths. like soothsayers prophets predict future... nobody keeps track predictions happen right they're geniuses. Yet question still stands 50% population 25 years old lots logistical challenges every year face. new normal, thing gone. soon lowest point since beginning 7 day average goes 600/day (not much longer). nothing pharmaceutical companies. vaccination administered public health care workers, data collected too.

Gevernments Europe seem quite open wanting treatment save many lives possible avoid unnecessary deaths. chances getting covid mrna vaccination 90-95% lower would vaccinated. chances getting severe covid, dying, spreading someone else vaccinated 99%+ lower.  Oh, numbers symptomatic infection?! Vaccinated people even get tested mild case. probably domino effect, soon first grocery store says 'fuck it' others soon follow, hopefully US least happen July actually Dutch :) vaccine partly developed Leiden, Netherlands. IDK company organized exactly think Janssen dutch subsidiary Johnson Johnson. year multiple stories Canadians continuing travel US holiday.

The US treated better Canada sure, coming back tan fully vaccinated, go BS Canada winter still quarantine ... Lol know right? - simply 100% serious knowing well worked one fascinating article neat idea they're background checked solid smart people. Yup, that's me. I'm fully vaccinated wearing want end fight grocery store. social pressure real. I'd drop heartbeat someone told could. Pfizer Moderna? No, I‚Äôm pretty sure get full FDA approval point. They‚Äôve extraordinarily safe far. Don‚Äôt know J&amp;J though. probably safest assume Covid get test. Hopefully vaccine time work, usually starts giving protection around 14 days might make less severe them. Keep monitoring try get medical advice concerned. Stay well.  Watched replay day. Hope nobody got fired hide anything time. able get FDA approval side effects deaths occurred. want open sued. 

We need people vaccinated emergency order lifting it. Yeah chance getting depends effective vaccine is. prevalent virus is. frequent exposure potentially infected people.

If reasonable we'd strictly limit movement willfully unvaccinated people.  true.

Ocugen contact FDA since January India trials done accordance FDA guidelines. Bharat Biotech's first FDA vaccine. FDA already said would accept trial results Ocugen's Senior VP Regulatory Quality worked FDA ""Office Clinical Pharmacology Biopharmaceutics U.S. FDA, received several awards, including CDER Outstanding Reviewer Award, FDA Outstanding Achievement Award, Awards Excellence"" still Americans may receptive mRNA vaccine could interested traditional vaccine. first right step incompetent government last 6 months   Behaving like spoiled brats. 


""BUT MUUUUUUUUUM CAN'T???"" necessarily BS, cases people getting vaccine, nearly ill would otherwise. MIGHT need booster shots ... know yet.  Exoect problems deliveries too. vaccines fight resources currently. look data mrna vaccines neutralizing antibodies time (like Google search, pre-prints peer reviewed, showing similar results), steadily declines time remains far(very far) elevated compared seen natural infection. enough time passed yet assess like long term, seems apparent variants evading immunity become problem long waning immunity will.

But that's mostly virus spreading around world infecting many people rapid pace. pace infections slows genetic diversification virus slow . long everything take do? simple, cockmeat sandwiches NC resident here. I'm super happy Gov. Cooper forward-thinking CDC/Dr.Fauci regards lifting COVID restrictions mask mandate. announcement create way incentive people get vaccinated currently put forth federal government. use help sway people know gotten vaccinated yet go ahead so.  Reading specialist here. I've noticed middle schoolers harder time distinguishing /f/ /th/ phonemes. Normally I'd direct look mouth sounds, little bit tricky masks. they're really struggling, I'll give keyword ("" /f/ fun""). end world, certainly another unexpected hiccup. ""Most infected coronavirus despite vaccinated develop symptoms require hospitalization, one vaccinated individual, resident nursing home, died, according study released Centers Disease Control Prevention.

Altogether, 26 facility residents infected, including 18 vaccinated, 20 health care personnel infected, including four vaccinated. Two unvaccinated residents also died.""  robust idea effective second vaccine shot (Moderna, Pfizer) day? Like, immunity looks like day one shot versus day nine day fourteen?   silly. 

AZ works pretty well. 2/3 reduction preventing symptomatic infection, nearly 100% effective reducing risk severe infection (hospitalization/injury/death). 

Sure, given all-else-being-equal choice AZ mRNA vaccine I'd go mRNA, everything equal globally. feel comfortable relaxing precautions, still wear mask crowded group setting.

why still wear mask crowded setting? trying polite feel 100% certain vaccine effectiveness?   don‚Äôt demand it. article says 170,000 tickets sold 33,000 returned thus far, puts pretty close 135k number.

Regardless, I‚Äôm happy say I‚Äôll one 135,000 attendance. Fully vaccinated masked course! kid immunocompromised well? child danger covid anyways Philadelphia: FEMA vaccination site got point go grab pedestrians, guess that's phase 2 means, expected flood people get vaccinated, apparently anyone wanted get vaccinated already got vaccinated phase 1b. Good luck getting magical 70% herd immunity maybe 2025 Nothing wrong it, like there‚Äôs also nothing wrong *not* needed, dirty looks stop people aren‚Äôt virtue signaling. think also prevent virus mutating something MUCH deadly. virus already mutating attacking children. Death result, yet see destruction going see long term effects.  makes like zero sense, closed wtf Congrats vaccination ! Well exactly. problem India Manufacturing vaccines logistics how/when/where make accessible general public. Especially rural areas. add this, US loaned 4M doses  ""tens millions"" March  yeah, lot US doing. We're already starting hit point supply outstrips demand, know anyone justify US sitting AZ.

I think AZ good reputation vaccine right now. sun bright Won‚Äôt even lie, don‚Äôt know. Texas small businesses opted still keep restrictions, full right. I‚Äôd say maybe around summer time people get vaccinated. Went Kroger long ago saw Decent amount people wearing masks wonder part reason WA much like handful liberal, urban areas smothered rural, conservative areas. CA rural areas resist vaccines masking well, they're afield less likely see much travel areas. could nothing it, but, someone lives north Redding troublesome area, wonder that. said would easy? Going moon easy. Fighting wars easy (any them). lots hard things, worth doing, not, hard factor them. Sure oxford... mean guys trying save face adenovirus based vaccine crap like adenovirus based meds before? study ridiculously flawed btw. Maybe help government use 2M doses storage get swamped new deliveries. dropped one last places comes speed vaccination government can't logistics. That‚Äôs true workplaces. anti vaxxers gonna basically jobs require it? December bought fewer vaccines Germany. article.  Meanwhile ‚Äúexperts‚Äù keep pushing people stay inside even fully vaccinated, dad watching YouTube video doctor last night talking effectiveness coronavac (sinovac) vaccine said still go little possible still wear masks social distance everyone times even you‚Äôre fully vaccinated cause might still die, parents gotten doses discouraging hear words. 

I understand doctors experts lot weight must think speaking still making people fully vaccinated scared going fair. Yeah I'm kind wondering theory mean Pfizer Moderna's purchases might cut half? half amount required?

I've seen numbers high 80-85% dose one, really know long term is. Regardless weird looked considering J&amp;J mid 60s. know 1:1 fair comparison point one dose seems show high level efficacy least period time. care search sub Reddit articles person speaking plastered front page, feigned ignorance good look Yes, quite yet. far mass vaccination clinics getting people come in. Mass clinics efficient way get people vaccinated, long get people come push them. people making appointment clinics need drop something walk-in friendly. mostly elderly people people health issues. younger healthy chances would even less. here. last job reasonably long interval paper towel dispenser minor inconvenience. movie theater though awful, short interval paper towel touch rinse soap off. came idea?! Oh right someone Covid advisory board Biden. Wow, got me! Let retract point opinion worthless guess. guess know him. thinking? must live somewhere different, literally every public place requires masks here. unmasked people going find home outdoor places, even parks playgrounds require masks.  Seriously mean? mean trolls internet can't imagine relevant scenario. foreign diplomat something? Ngl, saw VAP immediately freaked thinking ""ventilator associated pneumonia."" like better.  Ocugen planning shipping 2021 supply India (Bharat Biotech manufacturing facilities already FDA approved) they've already seeking partnership manufacturing plant (we expect announcement literally day now) they've already begun technology transfer India/Bharat Biotech Ocugen committed making 2022 doses US. 

They've added new VP last week oversee operation.   First line infinite doses first line 100M?  get think Europeans kind, China Russia India reasons bullies?

Because rivals NATO. end? Serious question think many ""vaccine passport""? want anyone get vaccine, ability something prove offends them. That‚Äôs US government official. can‚Äôt even. Exactly.  better move, better dance! utter nonsense. front-line COVID nurse Brazil, 70-year-old grandparent South Korea, school teacher variant hotspot India, bunch idiots internet - American mind - sentiment everywhere disgusting.

I‚Äôm hearing may soon too. read May 7? I‚Äôm hoping state moves aggressively know already vaccine surpluses state. kids (and kids know) eager get vax. Thanks India completely setting world back year.. way strain going around India right contagious. Shit's ridiculous. hope every country completely shuts travel India. people get exposed misinformation get exposed understanding virus vaccines work beyond overly simplistic ""vaccine stops virus"" understanding. Like simply knowing vaccines US target spike enough disprove concept natural infection better vaccine people *any* understanding works.   Dude don‚Äôt even think you‚Äôd need 500$ check. lot people would probably free Pizza something like haha **recommendation** made STIKO, PEI. Honestly? think anyone knows.

Simple straightforward bit oversimplified, get headache life get take pills another year plus likely won‚Äôt get protection vaccine either. know look yet still get couple deaths (12 6 females 6 males quite equal) like seeing numbers, look percentages versus percentages state Georgia get discouraged again.

I feel like need plan hesitators needs implemented soon. it, yes. restaurants they'll visit, hotels they'll stay at, facilities speedway they'll use.  situation pretty terrifying. new positive case 21st April alone 290k. increasing spread virus increase chance mutations. triple Mutation resistance vaccine, imagining happen quadruple quintuple mutation occurs terrifying.. disagreeing all. seem sold 5 6 times could reasonably produce. loved movie! *If alive means avoiding humans life indefinitely want it.*

The short sightedness youth. one year - many people need die others take serious? need hit personally? Take children?

If people listened scientists FOLLOWED recommendations, would near ""normal"" mutations would chance take hold. fear cloth selfishness make bad ~~American~~ Spanish flu. weird. indications points india probably suffering countries came lot better many. genetically predisposed catch covid-19. massive population lives densely populated areas people using mass transit.

imo due humid climate many people spend much time outside.

is possible india already dealt similar virus like sars much population kind immunity covid-19? Pretty easy interpret meant. way see difference administered vs on-hand vs upcoming production? Early 20's. Dang. COVID SHOOTING FIRE US There's lot anti-vaxxer nonsense even subreddit always doubt effectiveness it. ""You still get spread others, doesnt work mutations, works like 3 months"", bullshit like that. county little bit 3rd wave last month.

But 9 days ago hit 50% 16+ population first dose within last 5 days dropped 7 day rolling average 15%.

I heard seen places around 50% mark, cases start drop like rock seeing action county (at least last 5 days) hopeful last final drop. Interesting point. think number might change individuals see people taking vaccine acquire long term data? countries pay receipt drugs.

The UK unusual paid upfront, wanted help AZ financing trials getting bioreactors running know, totally possible, people crazy days Ivy League schools move lock step. isn‚Äôt surprising. one said _equally_ addictive. 2019 seems long ago. checked car battery thinking gotta four years old now.

Canada may actually catch US end May due hesitancy US. believe EU pursued vaccine nationalism international cooperation important controlling pandemic. trying vaccinate many possible ""giving entirely""? That's *literally* way end public health crisis. 

If risk getting COVID abysmally small fully vaccinated, odds getting it, infecting someone else fully vaccinated even microscopic. Therefore vaccinate many possible watch R value plummet. may turn long-term agoraphobics...  isn‚Äôt case. UK similar assessment AZ vaccine, comparing probability hospitalised vaccine probability individual (per age bracket) catches hospitalised Covid next N weeks.

The EMA made assessment.

i.e. risk calculation based high low spread currently Pfizer shots literally nothing except give sore arm. hydrate something healthy within days leading up. made smoothie morning tons antioxidant stuff feel like helped.  healthcare workers 70 eligible?

Do loan providers discriminate based major eager trap new customers web? rational world order delivery would per contractual stipulations. every single contract every single vaccine provider world works, including Canada, Europes, everyone else's.

The problem US bought ""all vaccines"" prevented going anywhere. fast and, whether luck good judgement, happened back two better horses Moderna Pfizer.

Switch Pfizer AstraZeneca Europe would US' position US Europe's.

Why hard understand? Hello,

I apologize know place medical professional ask GP retired wanted get vaccine going see new one. scheduled vaccine 1st dose tomorrow 4:30. migraine afternoon around 1:30. Reading articles say take aspirin Tylenol OTC migraine relief. 24 hours enough time cancel days?

Thanks see jumped ship another forum lie there.

You really conscience you? delivered multiple citations clearly demonstrating wrong are, hop, skip, jump somewhere else perpetuate lie there. There's lot whinge program look [government see precise figures can't spread lies like that.

There's 450k storage precisely moments like Astrazeneca rest either ready jabbed transit. There's 900k doses ready jabbed one weeks worth Pfizer deliveries arrive beginning week. think cases need drop another 75% present level. I‚Äôm gonna guess 6 weeks. accurate word someone qualifications understand properly means. Joe Schmoe hears talking ""mutant"" covid versions, going think thinking. Hence word reality best use, even though vacuum might be. Dude posts one single thread we're far buried comment chain one earth except two us reading this. 

But sure whatever, God's work! True, California's vaccination rate substantially better states. success likely due good social distancing / mask wearing behavior following big Dec/Jan spike. guess easier standard hospital procedure rather individualized. Also, currently great way looking someone's vaccination status beyond card would difficult verify someone's status emergency situation.  sound like 20s fully vaccinated still wearing mask face shield. Honestly might want seek mental help anything.  literally higher chance death hospitalization car covid right now. Maybe time re-adjust go back living normal life. vaccine cards/proof vaccination became mandated evolution mask-wearing social distancing mandates, might help \*some\* fence. course get folks want wear mask bellyaching needing vaccine attend event, see movie, eat inside restaurant, etc; several states already dismissed concept outright. way Fauci talking last interview CDC revisiting guidelines vaccinated people completely turning us loose might come sooner later

Next week two weeks 2nd vaccine. point, masking mostly theater. I'll gladly toss aside rules.  Good news! California continually lifting restrictions, plans lift more. feel pretty safe myself, there's good way indicate public vaccinated, think settings continue setting good example, everyone masked. also clear whether there's risk carrier someone unvaccinated even protected, case that, wear mask. End May seems extremely unlikely, given 26% us fully vaccinated point.

They're always sources. 2021 thing friends social media criticizing media, permanent restrictions thing media mention even layman put two two together; vaccines lower case counts/hospitalizations considerably, Americans vaccinated rather quickly, ergo...

Not even close, hence we're much lower government's priority list. things equal, share vaccines, too. ‚ÄúDuring lab tests, research showed ""several neutralizing antibodies ineffective controlling variants genetic markers BV-1,"" university said.‚Äù

This data coming yes. mean never cases someone die get severe cases covid getting vaccine. data comes available, precise India downplaying death numbers significantly. would also wait indepedent 3rd party review.

Fair enough, however I'd surprised researchers access independent data patients enrolled trial. big contributing factor youth sports restarted routine testing become required participants.

Can't know really test it, know we'd get benefit one dose. Certainly benefit dose. get cocky... Oh, thank taking time explain. make sense. appreciate it. actually biggest fear... feel like everyone eligible (which now) ample time get shots, reason keep restrictions. hold people hostage anti vax/ vaccine hesitant part population exists sets bad precedent imo.

Every restaurant went to, willing spend much money buying food order use washroom.But washrooms closed everyone , even customers.I places told us

Seriously, know diseases make people use washroom often .How people survive time closed economic reasons, covid restrictions? feel like it‚Äôs actually happening, might subdue thing Weird California's West Coast pals (Oregon &amp; Washington), frankly kicked ass whole time, seeing cases rise. think hard read much particular area well poorly given moment.

Sorry makes sad. people fence need little motivation. know vaccine produced Europe EU also paid right? pretty much boat. Got shot Sunday evening feeling better. Terrible aches chills, lymph node arm got swollen super painful. You‚Äôll probably start feeling better soon really referring Canada think Canada issue paying back. Moreso Mexico. Mexico certainly rich. charge poor neighbour stock going throw anyway really bad taste. hold stock government officials say even used even worse. think everyone would, truth is, know future virus. Sorry, that's truth. Like anyone else would like definite end date. However, nearly 40% county (now 40) I'm sure queue 'first shots' could good place come Memorial Day. July 4th could well lift state restrictions. could situation last while, hard tell. states opened pull back, countries. new hot spots (like India) before....

It's difficult predict, bet money 'over' least US. hard. Unfortunately, issue 3-4 weeks shots 'full protection' first dose (which still pretty good actually) 'full protection' two weeks later, six weeks. likely two weeks behind state CDC data. there's real hope sooner rather later vaccines may starting show seriously working (in view). Likely 20% country-wide US, largely cases starting go slowly (we hope).  seems extremely illogical say true. would reason countries pull away AZ vaccine. 

I know nitty gritty. seems extremely illogical pull given Covid also cause blood clots higher rate. 1918 Spanish flu World War related soldiers travel across world would like word you.

At time, one sort idea against. More. MORE. seems excessive Fair enough someone explain many young people getting hospitalised India (as opposed infected)? exact opposite usual pattern. According state, CT, essentially non-existent. 86% 75+ population one dose, 77% fully vaccinated, hospitalizations mostly occurring younger people.  free vaccines, open anyone, understand hospitalization rate high.

No. course not. seems argument you‚Äôre making. might true you. true vast majority world. Pfizer Moderna vaccines brand new technologies extremely expensive. Try thinking beyond skin. Yeah, make sense, guy says he'd ""rather get COVID"".

If get COVID, 0.0014% chance dying, matter age. IIRC lowest percentages I've seen 0.02% 10x 0.0014%. (Note modern statistics may updated 0.02% number, please link better number).

If want include risk getting COVID risk assessment, believe less 10% chance getting COVID numbers make sense. Hopefully mRNA tech change that. ‚Äúproblem‚Äù ‚Äúreducing SEVERE COVID mild/asymptomatic infection‚Äù definitely saves lives right now, may reduce spread, also creates environment dangerous mutations selected for

I totally agree I'm concerned considering issue people refusing take vaccine too.

However, mutations we've seen far seem spike protein efficiency mutations mutations increase mortality. Hopefully I'm wrong please correct I'm wrong. develop mutated strain evades current immune defense built current vaccines reboot entire pandemic back day one.

I suspect happen due fact covid prone mutations coronavirus. mutations we've seen tend focused around spike increase efficiency. 

We also seen mutations completely evade current vaccines. seen updated R numbers yet though keep around 1-1.5 like flu we're pandemic. Mind, 70% total immunity 100% protection vs. severe immunity metric fuck ton better nothing, better vaccines preventing infection, effective mitigating risk strains evade immune defenses.

I think we're page endemic mutation scenario frighten history viruses eventually domesticate species jump see again. 

We're freaked covid novel. 

I'd strongly prefer us kill though everyone get program get vaccinated. Two: therein lies rub, one hinted claim, (emphasis mine): ‚Äúif catch COVID don‚Äôt chance transmit don‚Äôt die we‚Äôre going lower overall ... transmission, ... mortality rate, etc.‚Äù

I think clarified point here. Sorry.

If lower mortality rate, total impact infection, almost certainly going reduce infection transmission duration. think right 10 days average onset symptoms. 

So lower 5 immune system mount stronger faster response going lower R that‚Äôs shit scares still. I‚Äôve definitely fucked isolation stress last year

I admit seriously underestimated impact would family. 

I family members therapy long term isolation severe anxiety due covid. think bothered people responsible.

A times got serious arguments people wearing masks peak pandemic. border closed? See post. There's clearly end point talking about...

Oh and, understand ""i see vaccinated people"" turns ""i see everyone enough vaccinated"" time clearly there's something wrong. funny, anytime got home felt bit sketchy using gin mouthwash, brushing teeth. probably good move. Dallas County doesn‚Äôt report Sundays numbers Monday anymore. report Sunday Monday numbers Tuesday. imagine counties something similar. math would prefer then? I‚Äôm trying cherry pick statistics. Give different mathematical model consider. 

How long take MRNA rollout mathematical trade versus taking AZ now? right. It‚Äôs pure theater. Yep. would surprising US. think issue seems endpoint, messaging may discouraging people would otherwise get vaccinated. What's point getting vaccinated life going improve beyond seeing vaccinated people? promoting return normalcy numbers reach certain point (X number cases X number hospitalizations) every single person (children included) vaccinated. we're supposed follow science, outdoor masks needed. 

Depends. passing someone? nah. Sitting next people talking hour, yes. Depending level community spread, is. Yes traditional vaccine technology. side effects vaccines general bodies natural response pathogens. vaccine technology cause side effects. That's, frankly, nonsense.

And thank mask wearing.  German parliament Wednesday passed potent new legislation control coronavirus pandemic across country.

The changes Infection Protection Act could watershed moment Germany's fight third wave COVID-19.

Up now, federal government technically charge restriction measures ‚Äî country's decentralized federal structure, 16 states free implement guidelines saw fit.

Increasingly, states diverged implement guidelines agreed on, leading huge disparities across state borders rules place. states opening up, despite exponential infection growth, others remained closed. Although may state premiers popularity among voters, also seen infection numbers soar.

Faced inconsistency, German Chancellor Angela Merkel's government introduced legislation legally obligate ‚Äî rather cajole ‚Äî states specific action certain circumstances.

It described German media move centralize power Berlin, however, move would require change constitution.

What happens next?
The 16 federal states could still block Thursday Bundesrat, Germany's upper house parliament. However, expected. 

If passed houses, affected districts immediately required implement new rules.

At point, law could challenged Germany's Constitutional Court.  Makes sense all, unless surge caused vaccines Actually wrong original post, quoting wrong IFR figures. reading 0-19. delete comment IFR death equal Willful ignorance? mention may misclassifying illness cause death. Good. Keep coming. total 10,775,817 people given doses either Pfizer Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, according figures published Wednesday. slightly 20 per cent UK‚Äôs adult population, estimated 52.7 million. Oh, yahoos? Nothing going change mind except possibly told fired without vax.

And think still lot mildly persuadable people get vaxed futz them. Interesting, know that. US fully vaccinated (everyone refuse, anyways) produce donate poor nations/nations trouble securing vaccines? think wealthy nation high production capacity owe global neighbors... Hopefully others learn this. Anyone talks herd immunity unironically taken seriously. Hello! please send link source? *Greece, Iceland, possibly France entered chat* Dentists Japan also incentivized insurance system work three visits could done one visit. everyone Germany took vaccine 240 people would die

Or could take Pfizer instead enjoy immunity far lower risk vaccine-related premature death. Exactly plan do. NJ, really enforced Ok, right same. Still worth taking imo, reducing right definitely worth tiny risk. laziness India stopped producing meds?  year? guess that‚Äôs next big problem.

Yeah, careful around street lamps night! New York City health officials estimate nearly quarter adult New Yorkers infected coronavirus catastrophic wave last spring, toll even higher among Black Hispanic residents.

The estimates, based antibody test results 45,000 city residents last year, suggest Black Hispanic New Yorkers twice likely white New Yorkers antibodies coronavirus ‚Äî evidence prior infection.

Hispanic New Yorkers highest rate, 35 percent testing positive antibodies, according study, whose authors include officials researchers city Health Department National Institute Occupational Safety Health. Among Black New Yorkers, 33.5 percent antibodies. Among Asian New Yorkers, rate 20 percent. white New Yorkers, rate 16 percent.

Antibody surveys segments population become useful way gauge percentage people infected groups risk, especially since limited testing virus first wave.

The new paper, accepted Journal Infectious Diseases, substantial limitations: 45,000 New Yorkers study, fewer 3,500 Black, major underrepresentation. participants recruited partly advertisements online, study‚Äôs authors acknowledge may attracted people believed exposed Covid-19.

But study adds experts‚Äô understanding disproportionate toll pandemic taken Black Latino people.

Its findings also come amid push vaccinate people United States. recent survey conducted Kaiser Family Foundation found number Americans, particularly Black adults, want get vaccinated continued increase. According analysis last month New York Times, Black people still inoculated half rate white people. disparities especially alarming Black Latino people Native Americans dying twice rate white people.

In New York City, 44 percent white adults received least one dose Covid-19 vaccine, 26 percent Black adults 31 percent Latino adults have, according city data.

Yes is. take vaccine yourself, take sake community. 1/350.000 risk dying pretty much negligible. vaccinations stalled, so...

I hope mean import India? shape work whatsoever. ran fever 12 hrs shot. utterly exhausted next day. Getting go bathroom left completely spent. Walking couch left breath. felt like death entire time well. Oh worries think got wires crossed.

I believe ban lifted soon. Bioreactor bags. Pfizer approved 12-15yo key. There‚Äôs crap ton community spread among age families ages literally recourse protection. that‚Äôs offered help families normalize.  can‚Äôt see mask mandates lasting strongly past available. people led think they're perfectly protected severe illness thus drop precautions. 78% efficacy infection means 22% mildly infected contagious others help keep pandemic going restrictions lifted soon. Unfortunately 22% mild cases start talking tens millions people going looking hundreds Covid deaths amongst vaccinated people many times unvaccinated people catch carefree vaccinated folks. get x2 stack hit point bonus J&amp;J That's reasonable explanation - less herd immunity many states, couple relaxing restrictions right time UK variant exponentially growing

Probably lot factors too, weather, whichever combination factors led Michigan early hotspot 2020 (likely combo weather, international travel via DTW manufacturing industries, etc) It‚Äôs 100% wild. could least sent text soon knew. want people gotta make effort. shouldn‚Äôt matter think real time updates anything, site think referring best thing I've found.

You run state see glance appointments available, changes literally every minutes. Yesterday saw dozens appointments open Safeway area gone literally 10 minutes. ‚ÄúThe British variant‚Äôs warpath‚Äù

The level fear-mongering anthropomorphism Covid virus ridiculous true. protests happen later summer. small group idiots protested represent 10million people live state. 

It's Whitmer thrown hands claiming hands tied seemingly given trying enforce restrictions, despite CDC recommending shut down. blamed white house sending vaccines empty appointment slots cities northern MI barely fill them. 

This pattern behavior saw last year masks issue. Although, think actually bit certain former administration. 

Basically, unfortunately, government - right left state MI - made political suffering it. I'm referring NYS legislature. Post power removal, ability block modifications extensions outstanding restrictions. One realistic scenario could Cuomo tries remove mask mandate everywhere NYC (in similar flavor past winter's indoor dining ban). De Blasio could proceed encourage legislature modify directive include NYC well. Oh... okay... bad then. interpreted comment wrong way. thought saying right thing. That‚Äôs completely false, Pfizer still 90 percent tile  kind joke, live Korea everyone proud well corona contained first, barely anyone getting vaccinated. current rate going take 7 years vaccinate everyone sore arm, nothing else. really happy since competition worry lol. Thanks Thanks man! Dude.. Brazil India‚Äôs healthcare systems collapsing variants. mind specific? Killed vaccines usually less effective overall, spike protein one stable parts virus, think? everything else targets it.

So could, theory, could also less effective (targets part virus). recall correctly, spike proteins common targets immune system anyways, renders virus innert disabled (can‚Äôt dock cells inject genetic material).

That‚Äôs bit in-depth, me, though. Lol 80 MILLION fully vaccinated people 6000 got sick 60 died... MILLION thousand... That's 99.9992% chance getting virus... yeah safe virus completely. number 80/6 would agree not... 80 L L N. made clear health authorities ‚Äúthe vaccines key ending this. reach population, end mitigation measures, please stay cautious.‚Äù aren‚Äôt explicitly communicating continually waffling! needs transparent. nitpick, generally agree, except one thing:

This purely anecdotal, largest spike post-Halloween here(big house party holiday). Insane spike. don‚Äôt think enough people right things NYE/Super Bowl Sunday avoid new spikes, observations. think already significant herd immunity amongst wrong things.

Thanksgiving, seemed pretty split. house party days, seemed close normal activity. giving away donuts. It'd go much faster could get holdouts Southern half go get vaccinated. Dumb rocks, them. Hold up, there's actual Warpigs taproom Copenhagen?? thought production collaboration, rules!  Maybe that's experience, NPs legally held higher standard role different nurse, wider scope practice. That's truth. Conflating NPs nurses bedside misleading. never said nurses they're pseudo doctors, disingenuous recognize differences roles scope standard nurse APRN. Ok.  TWO vaccines? opinion discussion thread even exist? asked legitimate question. Google thought head I‚Äôll come 100 different versions facts. also implicitly good news natural immunity often go dismissed ignored conversations. Similar thing going message mistakenly ""up to"" [amount time] instead ""at least"" [amount time]. 

The reason can't claim longer either case virus literally around long enough it. asked mom nurse keeps telling story coworker tested positive post-vaccine try guilt trip anyone wants masks come off. sign bathroom washing hands, that's staff, right? ""When fully vaccinated individuals meet fully vaccinated individuals, physical distancing wearing face masks relaxed, European Centre Disease Prevention Control said set guidelines published Wednesday. rules relaxed even vaccinated meet people still get shot, long risk factors severe disease lower vaccine effectiveness anyone present.""

The CDC literally said like 3 weeks ago work mrna way Why? doesn‚Äôt make sense Well, vaccine passports would resolve easily. many people cause ‚Äúmuh freedoms‚Äù Like Johnson Johnson? LoL like AZ that's banned dozen countries? like Pfizer Moderna still Emergency Use fully approved FDA? 

Bharat Biotech published results Lancet peer review. God hope so. vaccine available everyone I‚Äôd love indoor mask mandate lifted next couple months, though maybe that‚Äôs pipe dream. I‚Äôve worn mask diligently entire pandemic, I‚Äôm tired wearing gym particularly. understand it‚Äôs helpful also understand it‚Äôs soon moment lift vaccinations recently opened all. Idk guess I‚Äôm venting, hope end sight mask mandates that‚Äôs all. Looks like might back downward trend cases. time good. Thanks! got mine, hope went well also!  anti-vaxxers distinguish vaccines. said, rejected move UK part perceived unfair lock everyone ages protect oldest members society allow oldest members much freedom potentially months younger people. LOT anger UK covid sub time suggested measures might relaxed vaccinated people vaccines offered all. I'm massively either camp--I think fair everyone exit restrictions together, I'm really mad alternative suspect vaccinated people likely mingle regardless--but worth noting strength feeling evoke . Given Trumpy contracts OWS signed, exports filled finished doses open contracts fulfilled. ""number doses produced"" driven demand driven.. unfortunate line previous administration's policy goals.

The good news production going stay ramped up, orders completed floodgates open Canada. end

This kinda dumb statement, pandemics wipe entire species. brushing... know liquid brushing get teeth right?

And I'm joking. Big companies suck. Big clothing like nike armor better competitors ""name brand"" neither type glasses cause made luxxotica... Big glasses sucks!! Hopefully since Covaxin inactivated virus, therefore doesn‚Äôt specifically target spike protein, immune response comprehensive give virus less chance immune escape. US completely given restrictions since last summer like India has, facing crisis asking rest world send materials, every country would telling us go fuck ourselves. apologies, I'm discussions several people thread confused arguments.

Thr 60-70% absolutely consistently said goal line cross herd immunity. I'm sure argue otherwise.

As easing restrictions, WH said 14 days downward trajectory cases occur anything loosened.

As 100% ending things-metric. Maybe paying attention conversations? reality there's multiple arbitrary metrics use.

I also question logic ""people complying there's set stone end date"". suspect people complying ones whole time, just, lack better word, assholes. incentive get damn vaccine! likely caught someone symptomatic got tested precaution. Unfortunately think there's anything do. ... what‚Äôs wrong vaccinating everyone year? Like, people upset this? Two shots year freedom seems pretty great me. point vaccines point masks &amp; distancing, save lives.  appears like vaccines effective extra protection masks/distancing unnecessary, enforcement point presumably restrictions stay in-force vax adoption high enough. many countries would give anything oversupplies. hope used expired go buddy Lucky. second Pfizer shot took count. But, personally wants keep wearing mask not? something allowed mean mandatory. 

I‚Äôm glad recommendations right anyone could pretend vaccinated. understand hope person want lower his/her guard. 

Once fully vaccinated allowed enjoy lowering guard I‚Äôm trusted settings understand may prefer remain careful virus circulating less talked sooo many times. chances extremely small. miniscule percentage people tested positive vaccinated. Walking around maskless post-vaccine reckless. there's zero reason staying home much possible. people speech pathologists, foreign language instructors, teachers deaf. one seems care struggling. Awesome. Roughly order IMO:

The population India skews younger US/Europe, healthcare options vary widely (meaning systems become overwhelmed you‚Äôll see severe cases management options become limited), currently lack data variant strains differentially affect age groups indications variants severe progression younger people. us small nation, wouldnt ever pull something like this. free market awsome need impose others. Meaning take CDC FDA 6-9 months reach conclusion! one tell exact chance. 

I tell average risk dying covid post vaccination order even likely lower flu. 

If stay home avoid flu, need stay home avoid covid post vaccination. facility authorized FDA manufacture distribute Johnson &amp; Johnson‚Äôs Covid-19 vaccine, none doses manufactured plant distributed use United States. average r/coronavirus user would rather 1000 die covid 1 die extremely rare side effect.

1678 died coronavirus Germany last 7 days, worrying 12 deaths due extremely rare side effect looking wrong thing. Even vaccinated whole Germany AZ (which happening) looking 250 total deaths, currently get every day COVID. 

Now argue risk benefit young people given drastically lower rates UK close risk benefit 30s here, I'd surprised Germany better everyone get first vaccine offered regardless whether AZ not. becoming increasingly convinced COVID become virtually eradicated NYC end May. world-leading natural immunity concentrated communities disproportionately low vaccination rates, getting really hard see virus spread much longer. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Hospitalizations still waiting see drop first. really, assumed someone can‚Äôt even spell probably doesn‚Äôt necessary education understanding needed weigh scientific debate Even entirely agree someone's original post, soon start complaining downvotes, downvote them. obnoxious. can't stand discussion variants always pegged ""fear mongering"" (by conspiracy theorists fear monger government control ironically). basically news anything ""everything fine, go make strangers street"".

We could try nuanced here, western vaccines still great job, feel free closely keep eye variants cause feeling little nervous. however become threat science finds one fully evades immunity. think helps differentiate country government. think US great country, government mostly sucks ass. truth patent sharing stuff? I‚Äôve heard spotty reports it‚Äôs effecting developing countries. may totally asking two different things also. Lol Japan joke. Moderna #2 last Thursday mild headache chills lasted 12 hours. Efficacy way poorer best, adequate stamp pandemic India could get beyond slow vaccination program. pretty much is. insignificant number people test positive. Virtually nobody ends needing hospital treatment. IMO types people would lie vaccinated get wearing mask types people wearing mask along, really change anything. countries travel connections India talking affordability housing, take account differences salary especially disposable income. USD$800k means something different two countries. Sorry really understanding authors want happen Nashville? Nashville, like American cities, super uncentralized. I'm sure different music orgs whatnot heading city, Mayor resumed business-as-usual (aside slight capacity constraint) almost month ago onus establishments recapture demand. 

Not really sure NPR wants municipal government state government that. Intervene personally call musicians/fans come play/watch establishments? Could make sense. 1st dose popping ears couple days. 2nd dose, got 2 days ago, got 1pm. night got chills, body aches, hallucinations. next day felt like got hit bus lol! Fever, body aches, headaches day long 4pm. fever broke felt much better man, havent felt like YEARS. dont get sick often. Im 36. No, that's works. Efficiency calculated vs placebo group; infections means quicker data, impact relative infection rates two groups. Nobody problem anyone chooses wear mask outside makes feel safe. you. 

We problem government telling us also scientific reasoning says ought to. risk nowhere near high enough justify outdoor mandate. Weird, cause 50% vaccinations UK AZ look numbers. Yeah fully vaccinated here. Still wear mask public exactly thought, chances getting spreading covid extremely miniscule, even variants. got J&amp;J shot seems like might slightly better protecting variants. think people keep saying ""oh know much post-vaccinated data still coming in"" think data pretty clear. vaxxed good. Masked virtually impossible. HIV really weird virus makes terrible comparison virus. Covid insert DNA systematically destroy immune system, makes significantly easier vaccinate against. far none variants showing total vaccine escape, even slightly better chance infecting vaccinated people, herd immunity still going slow point need worry much. mean yeah, isn‚Äôt vaccine for? yeah reinfection based around body fought first time, people fight producing specific anti bodies instead simply take care tcells humanity problem, religion removes common sense. dont think religion thats problem, religion real pain ass world wide pandemic. 

If god doesnt understand need take safety precautions virus created, maybe god worth worship. guy Indianas struck lightning. Fox news site I'm sure probably says vaccines shit. They've saying long time... followers went health summit day burn masks hangout inside... crazy. websites telling .0008% 6000/8 million number... Yes, BJP that's conducting election rallies India. parties quarantining. /s Osterholm still job? January 27    said. ‚ÄúYou know, worry next six 14 weeks could darkest weeks pandemic.

3 months later deaths lowest point since October people motivated lie, cards cannot used proof DC metro mask wearing general compliance restrictions high, also suburban place generally pretty easy people.

That said, people wear masks kinds nonsensical situations understand. Alone car windows rolled up, jogging biking kayaking, inside houses. forget wear mask public place get scolded and/or glared staff people around you. little top.

I outdoor mall hangout type area 50 foot wide TV normally plays ads random videos whatever, PSA played every minutes voice droned, ""I wear mask love family"", ""I wear mask keep us safe"", ""I wear mask stay healthy"", etc. swear felt exactly like propaganda video 1984. also get vaccine Washington DC CVS Walgreens without using pre registration website preventing hospitalisation primary concern? even care COVID society kill cause hospitals overwhelmed.  speech therapist students could use face shields speech lesson. would reduce risk somewhat, though would important speech therapy well ventilated space, ideally fast action test could taken earlier day risk transmission student therapist reduced further. paying pretty close attention conversations complete agreement waPo article, I‚Äôve seen before, lay recommendations clear metrics restrictions-lifting. proposed article sounds great me! want something like what‚Äôs proposed article made official restriction-lifting policy state. unfortunately, people wrote article doctors ones making policy, remains detailed official reopening plan states. really wish state officials would listen reasonable people making recommendations like this, like Dr. Monica Gandhi, seems like not

Sounds like mostly agree problem still fact detailed, official, full reopening plan, vague promises upon vague promises nice. hope comes true

would lovely Huh, didn‚Äôt know that. Interesting Islam exact opposite requires quick burial. How? group who's going lie vaccinated probably wearing masks anyway. 

Midwesterner here, confirm people act yes, people lying vaccinated much smaller issue people getting vaccinated feel nothing change do.

change national messaging Yeah whats Danish vaccine? got second shot, I'm fine wearing mask public little longer, intend start hanging maskless vaccinated friends soon hit two week mark. problem efficacy, problem given utterly slow AZ fulfilling contracts, doses would come years late. Possibly mRNA vaccines safer effective, important, Pfizer Moderna track deliver exactly promised EU. 

You best safest vaccine, delivered decent quantities worse candidate. case especially AstraZeneca. Found randian. I‚Äôm saying I‚Äôve seen several people assume everyone wear mask full time job hates it, that‚Äôs true.  No, weld inside 2 weeks time. logistical challenge trying vaccinate everyone annually daunting. many extraordinary steps taken first round shots? Might end single combo flu/Covid booster, mandatory hospital staff encouraged anyone else wants it, like current flu shot program. Janssen????!? Doctors knowing expect something lethal untreated lethal treated first drug would usually reach makes large difference.

Patients knowing *can* stroke like event even makes sense makes *huge* difference. Never mind chance actually getting covid passer-by within range 3 seconds hit lightning, even CDC advise wearing masks outside.

It makes realize based fear paranoia many people are, willing self-righteous it. gas, brakes better. Another 100 mil AZ doses take 15 months produce current speed. 260 mil still delivered another 39 months. EU buy doses likely recieve 2025?  yes  *are* saying vaccines working. They‚Äôve unambiguous that. You‚Äôre redefining working means mean preventing community spread individual‚Äôs vaccination that‚Äôs work

If actually said instead reformulating wished said, you‚Äôd find lot specific Good government right thing, right way.

Ah yes right way. super slow pre-ordering vaccines use clout bully way front line anyway via export bans. confusing ""the right way"" ""the American way."" 

What every country behaved way? vaccine doses raw materials needed make them? lipids mRNA vaccines come EU, UK, Canada. largest syringe exporters EU China. list goes on. every country employed US-levels nationalism, even US able vaccinate everyone. 

It's also interesting see thrilled Americans country imposed export ban private companies. guess people suddenly like Communism convenient. Build wall! Yeah understand mean, works limited time. start productivity gains due learning. certain point stop significantly improving. least half year (probably 9 month so) production start. teething problems solved. processes optimized. Still AZ delivers 6th sold. target 300 million delivered end Q2 ... might make bit 60 lucky ... talk epic fail. SF outlier much city work home. Uncontrolled spread mitigation efforts place many people acting like 2019 vaccine rates around 50% makes unsurprising deaths would sticky. Lol shit . take masks off. point vaccine? Data, please definitely eradicate virus lol. Sorry, mean come across underprivileged said ""poor"". meant ""unfortunate"". days really matter money anymore. coworker works pretty big corporation lack money, slowly deteriorating there's lot family do... 22 mild symptoms 15,000 vaccinated. great numbers.  Brad Pitt? ok? safe? Well means it‚Äôs working they‚Äôre getting severe cases! think people going find places going require vaccine go forward. feel like everyone/almost everyone option get vaccine waiting 2 weeks-ish start dropping restrictions vaccinated would good thing. decent compromise provides incentives get vaccinated Yeah seems bit complicated. Question would cross border travel deemed essential going get vaccinated. Yes, cosign loan. Damn, it‚Äôs really slowing down. figured slow would start weeks. guess we‚Äôll soon hit point everyone wants them. Yeah otherwise what‚Äôs point said, true US government official said they're never going use anyway point still stands.

When US government official say they're **never** going use honestly see arguing hard helping poor country without asking something return....

Mexico poor country there's least 50 extremely poor countries need assistance Mexico does. money pay it, orders Pfizer, Moderna, AZ, means negotiate expensive contracts global pharmaceutical companies. 

I'm saying Mexico need help, Mexico country world needs help.   Anyone critical thinking skills would come conclusion year ago, good scientist also report it. 

I think societies ready eat cost completely revamping ventilation systems want induce mass panic, exactly would happened. 78% efficiency getting symptomatic infection

Which shit. Again: repeat don‚Äôt understand get efficiency matters wether get symptomatic infection

For gods sake, quit playing dumb. plan verifying vaccination? cards give worthless verification. 100 upvotes said ""And wait people like you, get deserve."".... interpret ""what deserve"", problem. sold UK 100 million doses - deal. 

Kate Bingham, UK vaccine chief, clearly knows me, said 30 million target presuming production went perfectly. reality producing new vaccine components comes difficulties. Hence 4 million approved. time difficulties get reduced produced within factory machinery. big issue going finding way replace staff would refuse get vaccinated. early numbers showed around 20 percent staff would quit company mandated COVID vaccines. Almost nursing homes perpetually understaffed can‚Äôt take kind hit maintain federal state staffing requirements. way see vaccines becoming mandated state/federal regulations require (a possibility nursing homes). Otherwise, organization going mandate it, know hemorrhage staff companies scoop staff heartbeat.  shortage vaccines least coming 1.5 years. Thus need vaccine production world. virus could add extra production using currently unused (for COVID-19) whole inactivated virus vaccine production lines Europe America. Currently China producing whole inactivated virus vaccines, European manufacturers might prefer produce Valneva vaccines instead Chinese vaccines.

Valneva might turn work well variants. vaccine hesitant people might fine vaccines, quite lot folks calling mRNA vaccines certain extent vector vaccines experimental. might able get vaccination grade even higher vaccine. least one order 100 million vaccines, something produce anyways.  saying year. Mexico reason huge spike cases along border United really wanted found reason go get last month. Everyone qualifies something, work public, obese, ever smoke, pretend like baby sitting nephew qualifies educator. Wait, turns people telling us fools wearing masks shutting indoor activities full shit?

No kidding. Wheres wife fully vaccinated due give birth June. doctor today informed would wear mask labor. Given data vaccines, effectiveness extremely low transmission probability, still hospital policy? Even J&amp;J likely still get approved, warning label and/or contraindications. valuable significantly easier transport administer mRNA vaccines. Pfizer one blood clot risk? tell do.  Lol dude, misinformed comment merit. 

There export ban, defense production act saying US companies must prioritized US suppliers. companies need, supply companies. 

And COVAX point... US doubled funding COVAX. Come back ready discuss things actually are, fantasy world sees them. 10 - already got vaccine primary. using morals/ ethics. NEVER wish death ANYONE. go right ahead project hatred.

FYI kind deserve... EDUCATION! U.S. plant making Johnson &amp; Johnson's **(JNJ.N)** COVID-19 vaccine must fix long list problems including peeling paint unsanitary conditions practices resume operation, according highly critical report Food Drug Administration. phone call itself, 30 minutes. ask basic info like name, date birth, social security, address deceased. info like date expenses, address deceased passed away, etc. need really death certificate, copy funeral contract would help well. end call give address mail everything, registration ID number, email links want check status application creating account. mail copy death certificate receipts invoices bank statements whatever proof payment.

Further, people grew take cannabis long car trips. beleive heavy smokers get intoxicated like casual users would love see data. 

I always mentioned smoked cannabis job interviews. I'm willing work job fire anything performance.
Smoking = getting high doctors update vaccinations regular checkups. However checkups tend less yearly vaccinated yet (the 16-30 group one vaccine numbers low enough worry right now) problem literally cant get vaccinated(talking EU here). Me, 19 yo person, get vaccine july vaccine delivery projections met, probably wont even happen. mild uncomfortableness 2 months worth losing thousands innocent lives over.

Another change 1-2 punch mass gatherings: mass once-every-twelve-years pilgrimage called Kumbh Mela, number political rallies tied upcoming elections. Sorry. fault.  anyone know organizations need volunteers vaccinating developing world? I'm get second shot looking travel Guatemala May. could help vax effort, would love so, also mindful voluntourism pitfalls (e.g. want take local nurses job). medical training would happy train jab assist paperwork whatever. sure would enough running around make work apparently need worry, lol We're talking nursing home packed full vulnerable people immune systems severely deteriorated age.

A perfect recipe finding hosts vaccine response less ideal plan plan pray Rona away, like gay. Wtf mean tens millions doses already made AZ J&amp;J vaccines?

The peeling paint issue indicates facility needs extensive work, throwing possibility facility getting approved time soon question. Wednesday, July 22, 2020 - U.S. government pay companies $1.95 billion upon receipt first 100 million doses, following FDA authorization approval. **The U.S. government also acquire additional 500 million doses.** BEGIN?!? 70% end domestic restrictions.   unwell seek medical treatment. vaccine protect too? are. felony fraud convictions would it. hard either, go eBay, buy card, sent USPS. point mail fraud crime many years, hard track sent them. need convictions whole thing disappear (go underground enough bad parts many try)  ""Exponential Decay"" going lit phrase summer Good. need carrots stick move along vaccine hesitancy/apathy. nice carrot. probably see sticks. companies scoop staff heartbeat.

That may happen, I'm shopping place one parents, might exclude facilities vaccinated employees. enough people demand services employers shift. hire unvaccinated people.

I'm advocating for, employers requiring this. I'm suggesting businesses market driven employee pleasing.

If want see this, employers need incentive, avoiding facilities fully vaccinated may way push shift.  lot people today upset vaccine mean ""tadaa"" back normal. got yelled someone wants go get pasta friends. Priorities guess Like said, using word ""mutant"" average person invokes fearful uncertain response future society combating pandemic, extent emotional reaction grounded reality situation today (all things considered, well).

Some people (typically fear-mongering sensationalists) aware effect intentionally use types loaded words, hence originally asked commenter put source claim.

Being molecular biologist, I'm assuming bad actor topic. talking people emerging types COVID, I'd recommend use neutral pleasant language. ""Variant"" seems accepted term mainstream media.  deaths attributed mrna vaccines? care search sub Reddit articles person speaking plastered front page, feigned ignorance good look

So abundantly clear, someone say something counters CDC, provide source back up, everyone believe it?

Sounds like operating pretty intense anti-science bias. Black Plague erupted every decade *hundreds* years threat. Check page week find out. data stays low wasn‚Äôt reporting error.  Many countries simply small able produce 100s components required create cutting edge vaccines lack specific technical expertise produce said vaccines scale unless massive country like USA can't expert everything.

Yeah get choose vaccine get. 

My GP disagrees. Cue Bill Pullman independence day speech take birth control take AZ jab. honestly think average human shit comprehending tiny risks.

That's works though. determine whether take risk, want weigh benefits risk, compare unrelated risk. give people lots drugs dangerous AZ jab, that's benefits outweigh risks. 

To determine AZ jab worth risk, want compare odds developing suffering serious complications VIPIT, odds would catch COVID develop serious complications could get MRNA vaccine. 

This risk totally different person person. long would need delay get MRNA ? What's life style ? pre-existing conditions ? What's prevalence COVID life ? old ? 

For lot people, makes sense get AZ jab. safer waiting. lot people, safer wait MRNA vaccine. person may also take birth control relevant. them, benefits using birth control (ability safe active sex life hormonal benefits) outweigh small risk blood clots side effects. 

It makes sense say ""you take risk life, what's one similarly sized risk."" based percentages would around 0.5% chance. there's correct answer question based individual. think purposely aggressively expose someone Covid even chance getting it. Heh, guess thought number would bit higher. No, could relevant summer. Many EU countries track vaccinating adult population mid-July. latest developments deliveries makes realistic goal.

Is also accounting chance getting COVID?

If 39:1,000,000 chance getting blood clots *after* get COVID, also need include chance getting COVID fair comparison. Yeah, nice people well, anyway.

Mask wearing real hassle pretty soon anyway community spread levels go down. like able go store movies anything. big burden. risk passing Covid kid can‚Äôt get vaccinated yet

And people mind stop using mandates end.

I think goes without saying.

No one suggesting ban masks, personal decision. chime say ""some people mind masks"", I'm sure that's anything endorsement since mind it, people either mandates remain place perpetuity. politicians leaning also exactly this.

Also reimbursement anything funeral related! asked lady questions, said could submit receipts funeral, burial/cemetery fees, death certificate fees, even gravestone. Hmm Please explain two current situations similar? Sorry, health minister President South Korea specifically laughing (as per story)? interaction talking about? Canada rich country. Canada reimburse US vaccines? realize Canada needed donations now. happened thiRd wOrLd CoUntRy GuCcI bElT? Got first dose Pfizer today! (19f) far haven‚Äôt symptoms also hydrated like crazy (16m) brother slight headache tiredness we‚Äôre great! Can‚Äôt wait finally unsubscribe sub ü•≥ one thing keep thinking related spring break travel. exception florida, northern states.

And Florida would make sense since that‚Äôs everyone goes spring break get complimentary COVID. Technically, yes could get Covid vaccine Tony Blair jab? first hated also, turned hated neighbours hated colleagues. moving another apartment WFH perfect. aMeRiCuH BaD Poop smells Yeah, they‚Äôre going try say there‚Äôs light end tunnel tell us exactly deem necessary remove restrictions. probably long 2020, weren‚Äôt you? I'm MN live IL same. Fingers crossed keep dropping summer best time year states. gotta andhbhakt. Could allergies depending live hitting hard now. millions people already identified. New York testing one internally. It‚Äôs certainly perfect find information easy card. Logistically isn‚Äôt problem look map, Florida literally southern state currently ‚Äúvery high risk‚Äù category. anything, we‚Äôre pretending don‚Äôt exist try claim they‚Äôre great right now. Oh I‚Äôm fairly convinced it‚Äôs certainty well. Hopefully it‚Äôs done effectively see substantial boosts vaccines administered abroad. Honestly, care conservatives say right along, especially were(at least part)? Repeating suboptimal pandemic response spite political ideology textbook idiocy. would hope public health scientists petty. 

Let clear, I'm saying original comment perfect strategy. confidence public health scientific community study massive amount data pandemic move forward improved strategy next time. I'm confused. know herd immunity sliding scale spectrum. usage, ‚Äúfully vaccinated‚Äù simply reflect doses two-dose series, +2 weeks reflected data? 21 year olds who've never worn mask lives refusing leave house without two masks on.

Oh, hu^ma^ni^ty Upstate towns movies still closed. got drive another town see movies. anti vaxxers covidiots would get vaccine, would end it, nooooo. much think mask-aversion dumb hell, summer heat masks bit like water boarding sweat. everyone gets work (and live) air conditioned environments. misery worthwhile last summer, I'm fully vaccinated would really appreciate able unmasked work whenever heat index gets high risk zone.

I think mask guidance loosened summer recommendation people wear something enclosed air conditioned environments many people. reassessed fall kids return school mask wearing would create heat stress potential brought back covid risk remains high otherwise recommended feel comfortable wearing rest pandemic.

We also maybe reassess timeline trials kids, biggest concern vaccinating kids really antibodies produce given vaccine (honestly 100% #1 reason vaccine immediately killed trials pulled market historically), risk auto-antibodies far lower exposed spike alone rather whole virus. seeking minimize exposure whole virus using vaccines US using whole virus inactivated vaccines. work death side medicine (transplant) (this probably kind confirmation bias brain salt) I've noticed lot ""dropped dead"" cases lately ""COVID positive x months ago"" annotated somewhere.  got second dose Monday, fever 102-104 range Tuesday. sleep move arm. Woke Wednesday 101 fever massive headache. Finally started calm little. telling worth it. easy. Among many problems, how'd identify millions people who've vaccinated, give passports? whole idea vaccine passports vaccine cards get pharmacist insecure (as are), can't people show get passports. delete comment?

I don‚Äôt think good understanding virus‚Äô R number mutations.  concrete information exactly countries place orders respective vaccines? I've trying find search skills failing usually CT first case hemorrhagic. guess procedures vary worldwide. emerging infectious disease. need reach statistical point data. X number total cases. compare placebo vs treatment group(s). 

You minimum time requirement, ensure adequate enrollment therefore math work.

Trials things like joint replacement certain duration planned since need know long device last. Blood pressure diabetes short term goals, endpoint studies approval marketed things like decrease stroke death.
