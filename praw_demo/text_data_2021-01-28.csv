0,2021-01-28," Yeah data going lynchpin later year around international travel landscape looks like. there's clear evidence sterilizing immunity vaccines, expect countries heavily dependent tourism rush welcome vaccinated travellers (even they're developing nations domestic population vaccinated). hand, getting vaccine basically makes possible asymptomatic carrier, international travel restrictions probably continue deep 2022 countries hit herd immunity internally.  Probably messing around dead mammal. way people got 1000 years ago. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article  might fine, Oxford vaccine think 60-80% efficacy still translates 100% prevention serious illness 65 year old anyone severe condition, would absolutely unconscionable. healthy adult 50 hell, even 60, really isn't. Vaccines rolling slowly, that's fact can't anything about. Letting healthy teachers 20s 30s 40s stay home kids fall behind unconscionable exposing teachers precautions essential worker miniscule risk young healthy person. I'm saying teachers deserve special treatment essential workers, especially given low risk environment stringent precautions. Sanofi France going help, 
1. They're unlikely export doses outside Europe

2. able start pumping doses later year. ranking full shit. saying Brazil horrible, really badly made. considers redundant indicators deaths cases. again, difference testing regimes countries extreme possible make straight comparison.

I Swedish, big defender countrys position baffled see 35 90, front countries much lower death rate Canada, since study factor economic damage collateral effects lockdowns. Considering purely cases deaths, can't see Canada far behind Sweden.

Anyway, remember first semester geography student, lecture demography. teacher said country rankings full shit, made subjective criteria, exist press loves useful research public policy. far find case disagree counties giving teachers. got first dose last week. Riverside County allowing 1b includes educators. Feeling badly getting vaccine means working. would worried felt great getting it. fruit flies = virus particles? New Zealand Australia us beat.  China developing world? Bizarre. That’s also true regardless whether start smoking pack day. Doesn’t mean that’s good do. going early Summer; believe South African variant air whether vaccine actually work not, vaccine development likely fast point. one’s saying don’t work. get vaccine mean stop wearing mask. server restaurant, already see going issue soon. Look, probably get vaccine. know that? Anybody lie say got vaccine don’t wear mask. courteous please it’s stressful past year working, don’t get paid enough 60%, Novavax. Pfizer Moderna effectiveness likely higher. Also, booster shots prepared, things completel normla given out, see everything open 75% capacity masks, booster shots given Everybody always seems forget currently billions people less developed countries got hands vaccines yet, going need cheap unchilled. understand “long-term” means? Scary stuff. I'm saying great, basically learned watching movie tv show character undergoes extended period isolation needs avoid going crazy, worked me.

I'm operating 100%, I'm also feeling ""disconnected, constantly dream-state severe brain fog."" parts day play online games friends call/Facetime family members substitute in-person interaction still good keep connected world. pets take care of. CDC broadly supported, vested interest getting right. support CDC, trust every single fucking word say. Please spread good word. current vaccines still effective new strains far. already working new vaccines variants may third booster shot even line. 

Worst case scenario, short zombie apocalypse, pandemic becomes endemic, like flu creating updated version every year. 

But pandemic, personally expect new technology make vaccines - like flu - able create specific vaccines faster therefor effective.

Also, may wrong I’ve heard variants contagious lethal all. Sure guess could say contagious means people die, scientific standpoint, it’s different measurements. companies make boosters vaccines variants ...what kinda testing go through? countries really gonna make go phase 1-3 again? post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Got first Pfizer dose today. Vaped little weed. Feel great. Hope get ill 2nd missed two days second dose. Worth overall, likely feel like shit afterwards. I'm American wants vaccine, I'm even able get waiting list yet. Anybody thinks we've got shots sitting around delusional Yep, days feeling like shit bouncing back fair price avoid death disability. Absolutely, find people hesitant adverse effects proactively ""doing"" something. especially true comes vaccine fears.

For vaccine risk something bad happening so, much higher unvaccinated get disease compared getting vaccine. getting vaccine proactive choice making, getting virus passive since trying avoid anyways (or assuming bad/not real). due respect care, get vaccine wait two weeks open season, sue 60% still good protection flu vaccines offer less 50% protect pretty well Yes it’s oversimplification since virus didn’t initially spread people eating infected bats. initially spread because:
1) Vendors allowed keep slaughter live animals shops, often kept close quarters making possible viruses one animal jump spread others including humans handle around them.
2) Exotic animals sold markets including bats, known carry many potentially dangerous viruses. It’s important note bats aren’t animals carry transmit viruses humans. animal can, really. 

So maybe better suggestion would stay away bats general demand vendors stop slaughtering selling live animals shops especially exotic ones wild. I’ll take weekly shots mask wearing, gathering restrictions social distancing.

Yearly shots? big deal  see mutations we'll keep updating vaccines like flu. went nothing vaccine less year. It'll faster tweak vaccine (and I'm sure figure EUA stuff approve vaccine booster/tweaks. bet already thinking it). Part issue public health experts going tell us exactly absolute minimum risk. Society though going take recommendations adapt consider acceptable level risk inevitably higher experts aiming for. every single day many areas lives. indoor human, I’m perfectly content staying another year. US real world vaccine data shows 50% effectiveness strains. enough herd immunity. Yeah, sorry Dr. Fauci, wish best absolutely not. hopping train second* shot

*2 weeks get second dose Enjoy sucking Rupert Murdoch's dick.

I wonder dick emitting that's keeping people stupid complain ""globalist conglomerate"" jerk stories former imperial past scream UK (as UNITED Kingdom) sentence talk breaking even further.  God want live Israel bad. win lottery first. Spent twelve days seriously considered absconding private tour. ;) Yes, real problem obvious solution (social support payments) would require putting anyone risk. Indonesia prioritizing people 18-59 specifically go work, transmit COVID. good news is, there's plenty vaccine available US, lot easier guys come get Probably vaccines. early outside countries. reaction first dose, second dose reccomended. data probably available didnt react first time likely react second time unless develop allergy ingredients time between. I'd like blame snowbirds, already here. I'm boomer, I'm going blame myself. Oh! Look state leader! Could possibly mask mandate??? Feel free tell risk parents infecting children worth benefits 5th birthday. mind different opinion me, skin back. boomers!  drop number daily new cases worldwide anything vaccines? would happening anyways? Yup, grandfather tested positive early December pass away mid-January. could another two weeks even death gets reported daily numbers bc paperwork...  Vaccine manufacturing plants EU used UK supply wanting vice versa give fck others think. Covid took job, sobriety, fiance, sanity, ect......  Fair enough. get this. Yeah, go near zero 15-20 days now. people die ones want get vaccinated. Otherwise, management optimum. absurd people expecting teachers go back work unsafe working conditions risk lives health somebody else's kids.

They quit then. I'm sorry nature fucking job supposed EDUCATE children own. fault them, simply happening online. expect fast food workers far unsafe condtions far lower wages, times, tough decisions made teachers get special treatment bc powerful unions. young healthy like majority teachers, really extremely low chance dying even infected, exactly ""risking life"" want hear whining abt ""long term effects,"" virus human history randomly killed people recovered it. may justified september know risky schools were, we've established schools republican states opened really spread even absurd sense entitlement people thinking demand teachers go back work unsafe conditions. Like sort say ownership labor. Fucking Karens. lot them.

I think might karen think teachers allowed continue collecting paycheck sitting ass ineffectively educating kids. Unsafe conditions relative, pretty much every essential worker greater risk lower pay. Taxpayers pay labor continue collecting money educating children. one insinuating people labor, free quit. appreciate y'all do, I'm gonna sit support giving special treatment lowest risk class essential workers literally can't jobs home. Cops, firefighters, grocery workers faced decision either quit jobs effectively, time teachers make decision. I'm sorry like make decision, kids can't fall behind. Public health experts called reopening schools, can't pick choose listen them. arm hurt much first shot. second one breeze me. slight chill/headache woke next morning, fell back sleep gone couple hours later.

My wife, however, felt like hit truck 48 hours. way never disparaged anyone wanting things get better. That's bummer. least educators get it. sucks school breeding ground disease read articles quoting scientists warning coinfections potentially allowing variants share mutations. one theory UK problem variants developed. fair UK might one country much longer, might well start getting used that. Odds Scottish independence united Ireland within next years negligible. Fucking shit Patio heaters lives. Wonder got patio heater contract. Good thing people could gather together outside &amp; warm...while gathered together... contract UK signed first mean honour contract EU. failure AstraZenecas part overstretching bother warning reddit virus experts possible fact call fear mongering even though genuine possibility backed science past pandemics. lack perseverance mental fortitude proclaiming refuse live another year like choice viruses. Even meant new concerning variants (they didn't), still win race. Vaccination speed far behind. Variant's already circulating know spreading speed beat vaccination speed. Making easier virus likely reckless least likely vaccinate sooner. 


Setting wicked March/April. loosening happening right making outcome likely. 


By way, Osterholm truly hopes wrong. Unfortunately probably isn't. Lol doomsday news according whatever source reading tbh phrase ""purple monkey dishwasher"" implies person saying random words nothing discussion had. did. True not, non sequitur.  agree, great news cases dropping, we've done anything special last 10 months. Cases dropping - part driven fact many people already virus (nearly one ten people US COVID, actual number, probably double that).  led catastrophic loss life - 426,000 people dead, climbing 3,000 day. WWII numbers. bad. want see good looks like, check Vietnam, Taiwan, Japan; infection death rates countries three orders magnitude better US. fantastic vaccines effective starting distributed mass, amazing science rescue - certainly behavior actions citizens, policy makers, politicians.  think scientists developed miraculous mRNA vaccines get world-wide fame, recognition, money. Probably not. Novavax vaccine much less effective SA varient original strain. far, Pfizer Moderna look like they'll still effective. even then, Novavax still 50% effacicy SA varient. That's nothing. although theres enough data say firmly, Novavax appears effective severe disease well. good news, they'll booster months bet. Remember flu vaccine 50% effacicy good year well. get enough people vaccinated we'll still alright. months covid-19 time Good know thanks Alright.... wtf?

First all, posted 3 weeks ago people would fucking shitstorm looney toons town batman bananas fit.

Second all... True? so, why? obviously due anything Trump would assume. BeSt!@ stuff right? answer?  EU didn’t prevent nobody ordering vaccine. Germany fact set separated order Pfizer 30 mln doses. distribution proportional population.

Nobody else done so, Germany actually something illegal. commission want ones tried cancel vaccine order nobody are, usual, spreading misinformation.

Both variants are, fact, significantly slowed antibodies original strain. back square zero. 


You get downvoted frequently post things true. misshape news worst possible interpretation it, go several degrees falsehood beyond, whatever motivations cannot imagine. Absolutely agree. Here’s great OP-ED thing probably ok based comment history. way aggressive confrontational.

Since Ontario, know psychiatrists covered OHIP referred primary care physician. psychologists also covered family health team primary care physician.

Consider asking help. Life lot better you. Good know. Oops, correct. 
I corrected original text. What’s cost? standout memories last March people, 100% agree. time, much wish reality different, we're here, know? I'm trying throw shit wall see keeps going day day herd immunity

:laughs loudly:

:begins sobbing: doubts. people may privately hold views, think lot people going want express publicly appear support publicly want seen anti-science.

People worked position going difficult back down. Antigens fall rapidly cells longer, cell test good people wanting know March 2020 versions English, understood phrase ""the good news is"" implies overall news mixed bad, subset news actually good.  unsure, every year flu vaccines, clearly make updated flu vaccines go full trials. agree. point, telling people, ""watch game outdoors raining, please open windows space out. would reasonable. say want Chiefs win. lol instead, bullshit worked work. amazes keep mantra over. Awesome hear. Glad you’re feeling great. Thanks insight, I’m glad you’re feeling better now. lucky me, first case US found right live 🙁 think agreed upon undercounted. estimates like excess deaths models, including excess pneumonia deaths, etc.  could go back further: Trump Republicans much damage CDC, particularly yanking embedded people China.  better forwarned use time wisely ramping domestic supply cloth paper freaking face masks. Statistician-in-training + medical doctor here. It’s interesting brought confidence interval fact 95% confidence interval classical frequentist statistics misunderstood. 

Incidentally, Pfizer vaccine paper, actually adopted Bayesian calculation range vaccine efficacy, presented 95% *credible* (rather confidence) interval. Bayesian statistics, 95% credible interval think probability range contains “true” effectiveness - though sets assumptions behind calculation may may valid. Sorry, term used ambiguous. ""hospitalization rate"" mean percentage people who, infected, end hospital. data linked percentage people hospitalized - note, example, hospitalization rate 85+ demographic ""only"" 0.8%. 

Unfortunately AFAICT one great data hospitalizations/cases age group. look hospitalizations see ""80-90% illnesses people 65+ serious pre-existing health conditions"" way mark. 

[Roughly 50% US COVID hospitalizations people younger US COVID deaths people younger ebola - nowhere near death sentence. younger 65, chances extremely good survive. still much worse cold flu. former teacher, care students co-teachers got vaccinated not, want return classroom asap. depends location varies. location anything site response time ambulance couple minutes. meant required site. outrage US vaccination aren’t happening fast enough worried enough got date second dose (Sunday), requested following Monday Tuesday.

I got pretty tired Sunday afternoon Monday felt like hangover day. Woke Tuesday feeling fine.

The arm pain *was* lot worse, though. hard time sleeping kept rolling onto night.  EU countries 4-7 years older median. US EU number cases, EU would deaths simply due older population. Finally... orange genius way got Pfizer vaccine today. second scheduled 2/28. side effects yet. work school that's inside PMIC facility, city's Phase One plan. I'm so, relieved. easy, maybe, lot it.

The camp went letting people extra year. last year going last year, that's it. I'm sure there's considerations ages enrollment levels whatever, there's lot kids never ever get back. weird .. Australia ran less crowding can’t even breathe one mask let alone two. lung nodules asthma. Yikes! Back previous comment, Ohio plans vaccinating February mean happen.  Yep. messaging never ends, work either.

The LA County health official would better changed messaging ""The Super Bowl 10 days, many like watch friends, here's recommendations safely it.""

Abstinence-preaching policies NEVER work. work teen sex, drug use, prohibition back day. wont work now. Yeah, people risky occupations taking stupid risks got infected... fact immunity means R goes simple cross section population. Wasn’t America number one, least Trump? How’s America Biden? FOMO real thing, though.

I think lot holdouts, see vaccinated people living lives, hanging out, getting infected en mass, they'll start creeping shells again. think happen people, definitely people never get hypochondria past year. coworker buying one space helmet like things fans N95 filters installed. mentioned probably months vaccine available response along lines ""But variants, diseases, etc. etc. Personal filtered air future..."" guy going well without therapy.

Australia vaccinated anyone yet. we've closed borders world (including citizens overseas) protect citizens home. first country achieve sufficient vaccination herd immunity way ahead Australia today terms returning normal life. won’t call beat Israel occupied territories vaccinated. Likewise, America owes vaccines countries occupying established puppet governments.

Friends another name Bullies. True, even relatively rare, no? thing even know point percentage vaccinations need herd immunity... important enough people vaccinated wont really work. Thank comment. suppose “do us in” relative term Immunity entitle travel. Sensibly, yet traveling allowed per time. Little done that, prudent measures observed.

Of course, many advocate downplaying risk favour expediting easing travel restrictions.

Interstate come soon, provided Victoria NSW fuck rest us again.
If rest country followed WA's example, we'd now.

But yes, traveling, life fairly normal quite time. pay attention day day, that's always volatile. weekends typically less reported numbers (because people take weekend off) part catchup weekdays more. 7 day average looking at. go today almost everyone saw also also double masked. bonus - noses hanging out! way mutant Covid strains popping faster deploying vaccine evolving ways get around vaccines, may never arrive safe destination imagined.

Some teachers able work remotely considering quitting retiring. Obesity increase risk nearly much advanced age. I'm sure two people described higher risk (do data this?). But, 90% deaths people age 65. Getting people vaccinated fastest easiest way prevent deaths. federal level yes, many states restricted normal life. 

I personally fully blame public health apparatus. one thing probably agree on, messaging subpar, put mildly. Moving goals rationale objectives, begging people buy masks, begging people buy masks span couple months(even believe ""we health care workers messaging still terrible) blaming public growing apathetic bunch noise.

I think that's man, thanks discussion devolve insults. Uhh… what? hope tho don’t see happening tbh  fall rapidly check CDC website, personally use Bloomberg's. got 5 think? forget honest. worked defense research lab. Good times. Awful vaccine. lot Europeans also laugh US governments dysfunctional though  english great, least think need put anymore! mistake made ""etc."" (short et cetera) native english speakers :p tests fall rapidly. cells still testable still operating SARS-COV-1 2003.

""antibody testing identify people infected relatively short""

""Once infection gone, antigen disappears. "" Good thing fitness instructors effectively making food policy then. Change wording article title friend ""social interaction"". There- fixed you; need iamverysmart comment. Double masking headlines hurt, help, public health officials. makes mockery guidance even there’s support they’re saying.

Argue N95/KF94 two pieces homespun cloth equivalent. Double masking nonsense means people aren’t laughing public health officials believe double fabric mask good enough. that’s they’ll used Get messaging straight people need wear real mask protection. Change public discourse masks. yeah, no. Masks going thing vaccinations happen. Streets gonna full they're gonna hire street sweepers. Shame powerful motivator. please god say ""flattening curve"" again. like we're coming full circle punchy catch phrases ultimately become obsolete within weeks. actually do, considered western governments run, based western european nations. willfull ignorant excuse a@#hat possible, especially Johnson Johnson vaccine gets approved. would ambitious realistic goal. Yeah, that's tax dollars going, overpaid teachers people always hearing about.

I forgot part teachers contract agreed go school person risk lives pandemic. all, guy paid taxes! “Scientists estimate number Covid cases 3x much confirmed” - New York Times. 

So there’s likely 100 million cases America add vaccinations means 1/3 America immune. Israeli education honestly total shit synthetic pathogen changes immume system genetic modification. tested fairly large group people.

Just look peer-reviewed publications available efficacy severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines. know sure.

[Link lancet starting point. Well depending accurate serology studies are, 50% Indian population already COVID, numbers going without vaccine. 2/3 way natural herd immunity now.

Maybe Indian government feels sending 100 million doses abroad worth politically using poorest members Indian society. They'd still enough doses inoculate middle upper class citizens. number week ago Everyone else selfish living lives, course. *You're* selfish one expecting whole society alter daily lives specific needs. 

Literally everyone selfish degree something. categorical trait. Basically job way. put household risk going work, put risk enjoy things SII already given vaccines Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, Brazil I’m sitting shithole America there’s least 4000 deaths day now, seen family months, you’re complaining can’t go plane kill planet more. Fuck kangaroo rode on, idea lucky it. Wanker. nice coordinate momentous effort without hangups everywhere else world Take away land homes, tell go buy vaccines. Seems legit. People seriously forgot pandemic US: ""Thank god Israel Western nation."" slightly doubt not, considering (1) course 15 hours, (2) Dodger Stadium parking lot 16,000 spaces.


The stovepipe amount people administer them. parking spaces. Look many comments article got. many clicks article get? think person wrote headline pretty proud selves.

To bad metrics success include informing public. \^This actually hot take factual. Terminology weaponized throughout thing, correct term something can't proven spread virus. wealthy school district area paid health care company get teachers vaccines could reopen schools. Teachers told could get vaccines specific office lied said health care workers. health care company longer allowed get distribute  Wont happen 50% Americans dumb toast bread. Type google : ""adaptive biotechnologies cell test"" Seriously, going way slow. good prioritize health care workers, time wasted trying convince get it. parallel line open anybody wants it. Pretty handy site.   
You click top column sort.   fine less would lost following rules, win. long definition “normal” doesn’t involve traveling interstate overseas, seeing anyone there? Aside wife son, family state, little rest Australia.  That's article said. said 16 371 got hospitalized. would write lie? Clockwork, angry unions protecting workers pandemic, pretending care underprivileged students.

They use lever, they're asking battle pay they're trying protect families deadly virus. think everyone China got anally swabbed consented? fair restricted nothing. issued suggestions advisories. Also times war emergency government tell anything except do. arguably could time emergency yet choose infringe.

Part even get something like unified federal front masking would actually build political it. Part like think government trusted people would try part. issue nothing sort situation. Either quarantine losing battle.

I agree government could done better educate us guess. I'm sure dashboards meant used analysis public. Rather threat level indicator course everyone already made mind disregarded start matter said. said really needed standards federal level least everyone measuring thing. 1137 per million. That’s 23rd highest. Written like true poet! Take upvote! go buy vaccines Way premature considering right now, though. It’s okay, there’s supply produced they’ll ban export already telling countries supplied factories! think jumping gun. Plenty scientists concerned South African Brazilian variants. 

You’ve got mighty fine hopium. UK definitely western country.

Israel western country geographically sometimes considered one similar western countries.

Australia also considered western country Same!

Wish narrative “bungled vaccine rollout” would update itself. concept much older that, probably going back least split Roman Empire. It’s application continuation concept modern day find weird. you’re stuck overseas, it’s nuanced distinction without meaning. tens thousands citizens, borders effectively closed. vaccine, encounter SARS-COV-2 fight since antibodies already ready fight, could kill cells. vaccine encounter virus wild, immunity exceptions natural one robust response types antigens. may know minutiae Swedish anti-pandemic measures, wont know CDC vocally sceptical towards masks - new mask rule says ""wear mask taking public transport specified hours."" almost like ""oh, guys shut bloody masks put limited recommendation?""  Thanks doctor explained almost everyone gets level protection, it’s like 4% left nothing. also said it’s possible 4-5% exposed Covid vaccine could take full effect. Classic paternalism.  
We government often lie protection.  
I'm gonna go Snowden Assange one.  overlapping different things. OECD even includes South Korea Japan. Thank hopefully next 4 years go back best friends together anyways good luck everything going right Would rather lie? know saying, America always what's right, they've exhausted options.  believe great mind, Huckleberry Finn said that. Almost half Jews Israel Mizrahi, meaning ancestors never left Middle East. People warned early second wave could even worse, expecting restrictions first spike defies common sense. Well could actually sign we’re getting back normalcy. Pandemics gotta end sooner later. numbers support end pandemic, sure, lift restrictions.  Perhaps. seen nothing zoom built all. built professionals speaking one two time.

However agree young kids online learning work. They're young. need interaction. I'm sorry position.  agree, “without huge spike”? graphs looking at? need socialized day care start returning everyone work. Parents tend work, ya know? 

So fleeced taxes teachers hide behind kid's safety ""teach"" home. stand corrected, lockdown single city one national lockdown hardly counts “endless lockdowns”. NJ. put groups, suddenly everything changed. wife teaches person 1B, 1C. suddenly moved ahead lot essential workers. shot give matter even get people still weeks/months behind me. joke. right government nothing prepare this, surprised? government left office transition plan handover entire pandemic, expect DeVos would handled end differently. Regardless, we're there's changing short term. exception international travel (and interstate travel somewhat Australia) nations back normal. restrictions they're limited stopping super spreader events. Well new York got crushed initial wave people even wearing masks. Since new York better California per capita. person teaching, job, imo. made western people. Pretty much Jews European ancestry. think we're going see one last big spike cases new improved variants make way around country. However think vaccines job we'll see many fewer hospitalizations deaths. We've already vaccinated many oldest vulnerable, many vaccinated coming weeks. profession teaching exists teach. discipline. many countries outcomes better sense shame parent student poorly. America. America teacher gets yelled underperforming parents way around.

This kind issue expectation. poorly parented kid even perform well person point. go remote learning seeing issue exacerbated. core issue though parents simply take responsibility seriously.

Now person better? Yes. always parents fault? No. one thing saw even growing parents present applied pressure kids perform ended kids motivated perform. parents absent, less so.

Now also right society messed wealth inequality screwed parents, especially single parents, bad barely make work all. That's whole issue though. One also need tackle.

Edit: also discussions many teachers job often use money pay supplies work well 8 hours preparing lesson plans etc. Teaching already overburdened (maybe lots useless procedural lesson plan stuff) demanding mold child morally build work ethics well insane.

In personal life big problem too. Sometimes people really think one friends smartest wisest everything. end taking one many pieces advice life gets destroyed.

Edit: References ones thinking though. update find them... virus Australia right like full tasty gourmet dinner waiting devoured. It’s you’re locked door damn virus working it’s way it’s set keys trying figure way in. they're still letting tourists? like US Third country you, we’re still western country cabbage 😂 bullshit. can't believe people accepting this. elite laughing us.

I’ve seen many fake ones internet, never seen real one. find them? pretty negligible. would least 5 years now. think issue assuming people similar mental state you. plenty people whose entire lives centered around structure day day lives seeing people loved liked throughout structure. 

To structure people torn away ever-changing atmosphere public health policy, brief stints hopefulness followed dread, again; gets bit depressing sometimes. 

So forgive us still following rules lived lives people saw day, unique scenarios moment presented. That's what's given purpose lives. 

That's certain people adverse reactions lockdowns. still follow rules understand reasons need keep virus spreading further; however, tough sometimes things valued cherished life taken away.

You'd think ""you get things back summer though, matter?"" Think way: past little year, people existing without reason live current moment. things made happy often taken away replaced nothing. Grief takes place something like happens, something important taken away know getting back.

I'm advocating risky putting situations could spread virus. I'm saying people break government mandates around areas.

Second, puts percentage terms. Half percent country vaccinated single day. democracy science. Lots non Europeans west. People made western culture today. southern CA city live like. Masks standard even people walking outside suburban neighborhood. Going see people two masks places go (pharmacy, doctor, dentist, school, etc). But, don’t go regular retail places like grocery stores, home depot, etc know it’s like there. Neither New Zealand Australia Western hemisphere.

Cases dropping week that. real leadership like?? 
Or another hoax?   give people 2000 dollar stimulus checks I’ll bet many people it. 

Give 2000 dollar monthly checks year I’ll guarantee everyone it. Yep you’re technically correct ... government hasn’t closed borders citizens. would illegal all.

I’m Aussie overseas family three would cost around $40,000 get home: that’s flights aren’t cancelled last minute, are. airlines forced caps fly aircraft would normally carry 400 people 30 people board. result even economy ticket like $12k, each. $5k hotel quarantine get there...

So yeah. anyone isn’t mega-rich lucky enough one limited locations government running charter flights get people home from, effectively barred coming home quarantine system ceases (which imagine Australia origin country flight question fully vaccinated). almost like ""oh, guys shut bloody masks put limited recommendation?""

Okay. see two small island nations easily closed borders, major population centers, warm climates. sure anyone thinks comparable us. wear one fucking N95 mask like since Day 1 🙄🤦🏻‍♂️ think heritage countries, alliances allegiances there's answer :) neighbors similar rules, get high initial number cases. Well vaccine basically guarantees mild totally asymptomatic case get right? woud likely mean far less people tested course means far less positive test results, effectively reducing symptoms prevent spread. like national guard come point keep people home.

It's like actively screwing EU here, issue EU EU plants production capacity. involved EU plants underperforming, that's AZ EU. 


Of course along vaccination schedule expect UK AZ plants export vaccine EU doubt Q1. What's point confidentiality clause later ignored.

The EU asked AZ publish it, meaning longer care half confidentiality agreement.

At point ball AZ's court, said yeah ok. Since choice AZ's, would say feel confident. know chemical cultures make Pfizer made UK?

Your 99% dropped &lt;1% won’t open sufficient numbers people vaccinated. quite risk-averse, health wise Australia comes public health standards.    Democracy work... /s active ingredient certainly nothing new, however may different dose different secondary ingredients would make effective. Ahem.. New Zealand would like word. This. Brexit mess UK suddenly become adult room EU degenerated bunch moody teenagers.  positive test rate 8.9 percent. 
Anything 1% huge number everybody concerned about. Fascinating article, thought crept me, least articulate isolation I've done share thinking relationships friendships. realize miss types interactions much friendships. full introvert pandemic, go often probably have. resolved change pandemic try interact people. Kind sad highlight week going groceries. Well, certainly exist really believe people disagree politically caused coronavirus spread though?

No, mean sensible people voice opposition restrictions long gets lumped right-wing nuts. lost Spahn set replace Merkel. 

Big LOL. want disrespectful really show misunderstand German political landscape.

The contract entails simultaneous delivery. Pls dont respond best effort nonsense. didn’t. agree need decide metrics close things Fauci politicians celebrity epidemiologists clearly consistently changed reopening requirements time time again

It one thing early pandemic it’s another thing fauci starts saying need 90% people vaccinated versus 70% week prior.   started increase amount vaccines offered delivered two weeks, EU one rejects offer insists publishing contract. Anyway, hopefully contract published EU AZ happy. super trivial. Anyways you’re even Swede poster whatever two case described mild. Two cases good stastics, encouraging. Got mine yesterday well. arm significantly worse side effects came sooner harder. Currently curled front heater bathroom floor. minutes fever need walk outside. body aches. know what? Totally worth it. GET VACCINES PEOPLE. virus contagious lethal?
Is booster coming out?
Because 20% pretty crappy What's point confidentiality clause later ignored.

I'd wary signing future contracts knowing party likely ignore significant clauses. “Excerpts contract EU Astra-Zeneca seem confirm this. According Deutschlandfunk, agreed ""that, contrary company claims, two plants UK also planned production vaccines EU"".

According broadcaster, Astra-Zeneca even assures contract ""that group entered agreements third parties"" stand way delivery first vaccine tranches EU. contract thus contradicts statements Astra-Zeneca chief executive Pascal Soriot, said British plants reserved exclusively supply vaccines UK.”

That's even thing know it. UK banned exports. UK pre-ordered first 100m doses facility. There's nothing else sell anyone.

On hand, Pfizer facility Belgium contracts EU, UK, Canada, probably Israel. EU threatening block all.

The UK's position expects paid for. EU's position willing take others paid for.  Aussie, spot on, we’re basically 80% normal, checking numbers everyday bus worrying potential outbreak something want rest time spinning earth poor guys went take vaccine still got covid19 anyway Everything I’ve read says novax vaccine lowest effectiveness compared vaccine original strain. doctor talking 90-95% efficacy research phase. 20% original effectiveness, 20% effectiveness reduction. Hope true Agree. AZ one messed it. UK taking care citizens. Thanks response! clear, cells unless you’ve fought virus? vaccine doesn’t cause cells form, antibodies? Thanks again? dont really care winning online discussions. see theres nothing learn person, withdraw. number meaningless without control group compare and/or time period. Luckily, article specifies numbers control group resulting efficacy 92% day 7 day 18. That’s important number here, 0.04%. Every study mask compliance shows USA runnof mill average among countries gotten impacted. idea USA say “a monopoly” laughable

Especially U.K. France example noticeably higher rusted anti vaxxers decades. things didn’t magically change joking you? We’ve already come side economic recession. ability fund adequate vaccinations. Low natural immunity issue- addressing said vaccines. obvious relations we’ve damaged China need held accountable cover start pandemic. sucks Australian universities can’t exploit many Chinese students, since student places un-capped, quality education dropped significantly. used care students staff, care profits alone - used entice high paying international students. receive virtually support get short straw basically every time. 

Any country upset shut borders less jealous country failed didn’t. 
As safe well managed country pandemic, imagine tourism far better somewhere like US, obviously shit job handling (and still handling) pandemic. don’t hold resentment NZ agreeing travel bubble ways lot better us. suppose (am sure) follow large group people ages vaccination, months probably next year, maybe longer. this, especially new variants coming around. EU's position one hypocrisy.

This. Uk's position one hypocrisy.

On one hand exporting vaccines made country countries. another receiving expect continue receive doses countries. Efficacy isn’t 70% 100 people take impact Yes, vast majority are. twats like piss us Yesterday, contract EU ""said nothing"" comminent AZ. Today, commitment exists, UK ""has right"" doses. Let's see tomorrow looks like.

The UK's stance changed. contract AZ guarantees first output facilities UK, UK paid for.

That much dispute here. chances UK made doses leaving shores EU approximately zero. 


We contract Astrazeneca states vaccines produced UK go UK first. 


Once UK mostly done happy use production help EU. 


The EU focus anger AstraZeneca UK. read effective old strain Moderna Pfizer, something like 96%. probably see contract today. AZ looks worried, according started increse offer vaccines...

If AZ vaccine low efectiveness people 65, take blessing timing. modify vaccine stratregy account this.

And race. Honestly, happy ISR, USA UK advancing greatly vaccination! preferred taking time maximize safety effectiveness. choice. fine it. mean, would love immunization advanced yours, kind accept trade chose. anyone ever said anything phones possibly risk we've largely ignored? We've went hard masks handwashing never really mentioned thing pocket/hand time constantly touch never clean. bother, try steal UKs supply (and fail). least three studies shown average Covid victim lose 11 years life, co-morbidities adjustments. one papers: Australia NZ think US Europe seriously fucked up. ""Shoot first ask questions later"" instead ""prevention better cure"" bad unfair, incorrect. testing asymptomatic people? personally know two people tested positive Covid vaccinated. nobody would known “caught” Covid nobody tested them. 

I really hope nobody assuming vaccinated people don’t contribute spread Covid-19. I'm using disposables every time take mine off, throw away. Even take I'm riding car. also sanitize hands take off. One fifth reduction sucks, I’m happy knowing could happened fuckup EU side. see political games EU playing, perhaps media got you.

They've ordered late multiple vaccines receive shipments later countries. already deal like UK's table, Commission took three months delay changed nothing.

They want countries share equally shortfalls, today sign law allows block exports EU's shortfall made first.

They want vaccine nationalism, playing nationalistic games.

Germany elections soon. One candidates replace Merkel Health Minister.

EU's vaccination rollout way behind UK US.

The optics terrible. Internally huge political mess they're desperately lashing trying cover making countries companies look right stop export vaccines companies fucking EU UK still insisting receiving quantity, rather sharing success. 

This hypocritical statement. UK due 30m doses AZ September. We've got nowhere near that. right EU stop export vaccines recover shortfall? right UK same? Clearly joke. 

Regards, Australia. own, somewhat significant hang-up, though absolutely similar rules Sweden. Absurd. 

It’s fully possible believe authorities outright manipulative talking this. still true. 

You’ve open shopping malls, gyms, bars, restaurants, etc. along. practically still mask recommendations. test less recommends. You’ve practically border control except recently towards DK, U.K. schools open along. practically don’t contact trace, practically don’t believe presymptomatic spread. Etc. Etc. Wrong. vaccine wasn’t effective others original strain either.

It’s good vaccine. doesn’t mean Vaccines ineffective.  community north Canada impacted alot numbers surging up... asked try read materials online guess solid answer question. looking estimation reinfected ppl. 1 person know caught twice sure far apart first time caught second time caught it. Ill look cause second time caught virus passed away. articles found doctors interested type topic. ppl worried catching virus second round gonna complicated thanksgiving didn’t significant increase case rate increase already rising. Christmas New Years holiday showing bump evidence vaccine prevents infection. likely also prevents transmission, data say anything it.

To put another way, vaccine definitely reduces getting sick lot. necessarily prevent someone getting someone else sick. probably does, conclusive data yet (as much trickier show). Slovakia, country 5 million, rounds mass testing 3 million people tested using antigen tests weekend. autism? 🌝 Actually, y'all wrong this. I'm Swede I've seen least 50% people wearing masks outside, least 70% public transit. one avoid wearing masks due treated wearing summer, NOW, perfectly acceptable. Literally one 2015 even though 2019 record low. even slight difference mortality rates people different ages, exactly prudent first vaccinate 30 year olds chemo, 50 year old hbp etc. Thats screwed many states begin with, overall u gotta prioritize getting vaccines arms say trying find exact order many population niches. odds also stop working due mutation. vaccines based original, different parts yes face different mutations beat reduce efficacy. Canada getting help India. Especially golden cu*k PM sided Khalistani separatists. 60 million doses month waiting administered, going bad used within next four seen contract. know commitments made.

The point is, EU acted slow, acted slowly every vaccine ordered. UK get J&amp;J vaccine EU acted quickly. Severity seems little infection itself. something makes immune system go self destruct mode. Yeh like Trump bit puzzled went ""The last administration plan distributing virus."" one week later, ""We're better anyone else.""

where getting from?? Wow. It’s notnincivility say “I haven’t seen objective data variants deadly”

I legitimatly upvoted comment replied agreed Rememeber doctors ""anti vaxxers"" (though one specific vaccine, like covid, pro others make someone anti vaxx).

Doctors spent almost decade learning maybe decades practicing.

So say them? illiterate? unscientific? lvl 99 virus killers reason Swedes think wearing mask inherently like giving freedom ”not democratic”. people giving shit summer would changed nothing. I’m sure book cooking lot areas. live state believe cooking books overall.... county, example, might be. didn’t great transparency health dept get go. local reporter uncovered 30 deaths (from combing public records, isn’t first time) gone unreported month Dec. None “covid positive car accidents” either. Another 8 since new year also unreported, obviously data lag little. much lags around here... idk. Suddenly, dump 24 deaths announced health dept yesterday following investigative reporting.... I’m sure slowly others added. reporter goes poking real data. clinical program wait 30 mins get checked doctor after. Hi Worried 82 year old parents getting shot. area gives Moderna. health issues. doctors site shot given? worried something bad happen rush ER really risk catching Covid. dont go out. want shot see children family again.   worries unfounded, think? couldnt live guilt anything ever happened shot. right now, indefinite. Since pandemic testing widespread. (Roughly March) evidence covid reinfected rate higher every disease consider “provides immunity.” Previous coronaviruses provide around 10-15 years more. 

There zero reason worry losing immunity unless know doctor diagnosed terrible immune system trouble cell imprinting and/or antibody production respiratory ailment mink mutation popped Germany.

I’m debating trying get tested every often sake science. expecting 3 million dead year mitigation efforts probably correct.

Except we've seen several states, *entire countries* imposed next restrictions, none saw proportional death tolls even remotely close that. Surely epidemiologist, aware US' per capita fatality rate outlier even compared many Western countries imposed harsh lockdowns. fact people want deal with? Yep. EU signed contract, much choice. ’s surging third coronavirus wave driven highly transmissible variant first detected UK , according country’s health minister, daily death tolls continue rise sharply. light sustained rise new cases deaths, parliament voted extend Portugal’s lockdown week mid-February, prime minister shouldering blame world's worst coronavirus surge seen country’s health system verge becoming overwhelmed. Mr Costa said coronavirus situation deteriorated part decision relax measures Christmas New Year, surge number cases caused new variant. Hell no! Let’s wait whatever wait ones didn't. They've production delays. still able produce numbers claimed, different schedule. may future even exceed planned capacity still meet final deadline. long first second shot?

The variant first detected America isolated eastern Colorado tip-off fairly widespread USA. Well, United States already purchased 100 million doses it. think it’s better administer doses Americans, donate needier countries? Good analogy. vaccines combined enough stop pandemic. honestly quicker get better. J&amp;J/Novavax imagine ease supply quite countries. booster take time. Possibly lot time.

And also results taking away one major advantages vaccine. (Single dose) Sure, still lower cold storage requirements, Moderna's (or Pfizer's can't keep straight) already oppressive.

I'm saying makes whole thing failure, concerning since going variants emerging coming time 66% efficacy mild cases, vaccine allow much higher potential mutation others allow much replication/mutation.

Why take 3 months longer France, Germany, Italy Netherlands ready sign June? don’t want us used justify making worse. Believe I’m well aware what’s going states, family there. don’t. Well, think know looking good... studies done severity infection catch covid-19 getting vaccine? evidence suggest infection vaccination reduced severity? Interestingly, Florida slightly fewer Covid deaths per capita average US state despite elderly population. important vaccine produces peak antibodies 52 days unfair compare 85% data vaccine antibodies' peak. Saying avoiding 85% severe cases 4 weeks like saying Pfizer avoids severe 60% cases COVID one dose. assume stick what’s recommend RKI. also think netherlands/France/Belgium neighbouring countries could follow RKIs advice well respected. whole thread seems brigaded PR action - positive things allowed. middle-aged adults know who’ve didn’t require hospitalization, therefore technically count “mild” cases, several said sickest they’ve ever entire lives didn’t seek hospitalization advised doctor due local hospitals overwhelmed.

So yeah, survived without going hospital, felt sick enough go. One said, “There times thought updating will.”

None “mild” cases sounded like something I’d want go through. probability exam. failed. really hard say world want imagine. I'd argue eventually us would grown tired restrictions. guess people would grown tired restrictions say end year latest point governments would probably look implementing much tougher border controls avoid importing new cases. 

Although even get vaccines may instead developed treatments significantly reduce risk covid. really matter point brawl actually get vaccine? I've trying 75 year old copd suffering mother since eligible luck western PA. everyone wants one vaccinated half year since first people got shots larger portion population see vaccine safe likely take it. 0 concern right idiots want it. fact happy take place line....and mother. They're first countries world, first global north. people too, stupid rest us. sister nursing school believes every conspiracy theory tik tok tells comforting OP relaying anecdote recovered (still signifiant) after-effects completely different virus, without veering conspiracy territory stating “COVID bad media portrays it”. US, media often show challenging circumstances occurring hospitals, population accurate understanding virus it’s risks (arguably part media amplifying disinformation right wing politicians, etc.), impacted overall response. fact downplaying unhelpful statement, better approach would direct OP verified sources show lower (but still 0) risk complications based age, mitigation strategies keep safe vaccinated. that's think too. variant first found UK what, September October? Flights never shut Heathrow US. pretty simple concept months, we've shit sequencing tests officially ""uncovered"" now. 

Unfortunately, media health authorities - media clicks reprehensible health authorities least noble reason spreading caution - reporting found ""landed"" last week, scaring dooming people even though cases going constant rate. attribute idea UK variant months, that's doubly good sign. play board, opinions things. shaved shit back march. YES. Thank you. People left right trying tell young healthy people need take ASAP without single thought long covid.

I know mildly infected formerly healthy person sees cardiologist.

Maybe data doesn’t exist, that’s problem. 

Excellent vaccines exist. need them. meant ""we never go back old world"". low cost vaccine ~$2.. sold EU profit.. still coming, little less early on.. UK also received much less hoping receive, sucks try expand production. 

Many countries faced similar delays shortages.. 

All talk seizing vaccines toxic and, case make shortfall. 

Certainly seems like last time company going risk putting headache real reward, even pandemic times, good deed goes unpunished that. EU imposed export restrictions make sure vaccine producers delaying shipments EU fully shipping countries. UK blanket ban. Yep, called ""heterologous boosting"". combined vaccine approach may fact generate broader immune response best way go view newer variants. It’s stopping exportations, it’s monitoring British people longer part EU, choice. people 27 EU member states are. EU act best interest, best interest British people.

The fact even needs said boggles mind. think people bother flu shot never bad case flu. point I've H1N1 covid (I work hospital), H1N1 order magnitude worse personally.  correct, obviously.

The good thing J&amp;J vaccine would still reduce R0 would fall 1 eventually, even happens slower vaccines.

I suppose could use Moderna elderly, Pfizer maybe AstraZenica people risk, use J&amp;J everyone else.

The J&amp;J vaccine made larger quantities (hopefully...), end whichever vaccin available may one used. Oh honey, Americans talking Jews kind space laser- nothing could say would make difference anti-semites around here. America done lost mind. Social end pandemic even ardent social distancers give up. 

I think we're seeing mixture social end (Superbowl fans, restrictions lifted) actual medical end vaccines. much I'd like see standard 4-day work week agree logic Would want 66% vaccine now, 95% vaccine half year?

This issue EU. US gets 95% effective ones everyone. EU bother order those, we'll make garbage. video, proof. telling opposite seen videos posted shows PROOF.

So far showed nothing.  Wow, one single worst papers I’ve read months.

If BLAST protein proteins human proteome, shit you’re going find lot overlap. That’s negative selection antibodies. authors like... never done protein biochem before?

That’s genuinely appalling. Like, that’s “review pubpeer send retractionwatch” level terrible science right there. Thanks sharing, wow, that’s something else. Seriously stop received doses Pfizer. 2nd shot gave body aches chills next day. nothing bad. yeah, could gone wring? Seems brigading happening. Maybe commenters J&amp;J stock, lol. reason mention UK, Belgium, Italy?  think big takeaway Europe’s functional response still virus run rampant. account fact US tests more, earths per capita cases per capita aren’t different Europe US. Maybe marginally better Europe close enough could due differences techniques rather true differences.

It’s certainly possible difference real due government action don’t think there’s strong enough evidence suggest that. Keep mind although US didn’t strong centralized plan, many states led Democrats really strong plans put place. saw extent Europe, countries like Sweden much meanwhile, everyone working grocery stores gas stations risk educating children isnt important ?

No. post spreading rumors, distrust fake news. Listen people make vaccine say. Important data 66% number really tell us

\- 85% efficacy regarding severe cases 27 days injection, 49 days (though mention much)

\- 100% efficacy regarding hospitalization death (so probably around 90-95% reduction hospitalizations COVID 97-100% deaths)

\- 66% efficacy 27 days injection there's comment much efficacy grow day 49 day 54. Phase II results showed significant antibodies increase day 27 day 54

\- 57% effective South African variant, means second-dose regimen (that's tested phase III right now) could significantly powerful South African variant

So there's chance J&amp;J better two shots. right saying Vucic promised help neighbours. establishing domestic production Russian Sputnik V, make Serbia main supplier vaccines region, hopefully SOON POSSIBLE. also likely EU approve Russian vaccine well, help whole Europe AstraZeneca even working Russia combining two vaccines. im sure post this, girlfriend’s coworker’s boyfriend tested positive. coworker left go get rapid test. apparently sometimes clients office work, gf coworkers sometimes pull masks down.

im sure do. fortunately deal virus directly. gf live one else. go grocery store. quarantine? get tested? still things even coworker’s rapid test comes back negative? ive told trust rapid tests.

I personally would not, that's I've recently Covid recovered it. I'm good while, someone else could use jab instead. going get vaccine, situation affords ability wait 6 months get best vaccine possible then. people satiation. never Covid, shoot ASAP.

Yeah. mother thought test vaccine gave shot gave COVID-19. 
""That's works, Mom...""

It's understanding everyone got placebo 'unblinded' secure FDA approval, got placebo offered chance get vaccine. I’d like know means people severe allergies. get point afaik vaccines probably wil stop transmission (there isn’t enough data moment). 
They said get infected right now, approx. 2 days get first symptoms transmit virus. Johnson Johnson vax stops severity, might chance get sick meaning transmit that. wrong? see lots people one thin layer loose bandana seems pointless.

No one going shut sniffles. Eye prize: knock hospitalizations deaths we're acceptable level risk full return normal. elderly relatives would vaccinated moot point GenPop likely choice while. Pre-existing conditions elderly folks prioritized mRNA vaccines imo. really think roll J&amp;J exclusively younger populations (obviously without pre-existing conditions). Seems like win-win go route, I'm far expert support idea conservative covid, testing still massive shitshow. would support they’re going offering rapids check in. Otherwise going huge headache, states already dropped testing capabilities focus vaccination efforts thus leaving us little options cheap tests trying scrounge private clinic costs.

Depends definition overwhelmed. ask nurse Sweden, probably get different answer.

In August, reports healthcare staff quitting due pressure enough time recover reports people operations postponed elderly denied treatment.

Just number reach limit - mean overwhelmed. I'd prefer sputnik fear Sinopharm big quantities near future Honestly. subreddit fucking shit man. Fuck modz **purpose** 5.4, 5.4

The purpose is: 5.4 **Manufacturing Sites** work months mRNA vaccines widely available? choice get? distributers start upcharging mRNA version? mRNA version restricted high risk people?

Im excited time Im pretty cozy WFH job dont mind hanging bit longer mRNA vaccine. hope actually becomes available. That's great spread parents spread coworkers. overweight coworker dies 4 weeks classes start again.

Hard pass. People die this. need block exports materials required produce vaccines - would petty, lives line. think way late strategy work. Zeka, MEARS, Ebola, Sars even get raised eyebrow distancing year ago even though reported cases U.S. thing clearly different. I'm sure warrant better attention 1000's positions could different outcome. Thank work. watched videos saw news. know random reddit thread connected celebrity. 

In video talk issues around counterfeits. point place least likely buy counterfeit? really makes feel privileged getting Pfizer vaccine. ""According figures first reported Wall Street Journal, AstraZeneca paid university up-front fee $10m (£7.4m) promised $80m (£59.4m) ""milestone payments"".

AstraZeneca take profit COVID-19 pandemic, decision says based views range independent July 2021 figure something bounding pal. I'm standing officially reported leaked. I'm going say bullshitting that's fair neither us knows.

Sometimes need second reread type mean. change substance comment keeping message clear normal medicine something works 100%? prevent “long COVID” issues? worry taking getting moderate severe case COVID lasting issues. immunocompromised worry lot.  better MH competent govt. ...no one gives fuck covid 19

Not true. Everybody know care lot risk spreading virus, even majority say follow recommendations put out. disappointing see much disinformation here. Correct, hoarding physical doses, placed orders enough vaccines vaccinate populations several times over, makes impossible countries access doses time soon. Also, important mention Covax' goal 2021 ! provide enough vaccines immumize 2-3 % country's population. talk global cooperation lie ones lying hypocritical rich countries. think 2-dose requirement fundamental requirement mRNA vaccines. mRNA vaccine, 2 steps required body- first cells start transcribing mRNA, second body develops immune response new proteins.

But right- 2 doses may better one here. Perhaps J&amp;J vaccine effective may well patients developed strong enough immune response 1 dose, 2nd dose may significantly improve things.

US leading world coronavirus cases deaths attributed lack national coordinated effort utilize face masks, social distancing, school closures, testing contact tracing, said. Hotez cited forecast Institute Health Metrics Evaluation University Washington predicted 95% public wore masks, 130,000 lives would saved September 22, 2020 February 28, 2021.  make big deal we'd sitting every minute reminding students keep masks cover nose. We’re talking something reason. It’s virus. mitigate risk spread stop people dying. taken strong steps early everyone complied best abilities, could basically like Australia right now. Basically open whatever want long spread stays small. we’re important fr America. Bunch selfish children. probably kill 1 million people said done. thank fucking god didn’t wear piece cloth mouth couple months.  unprofessionalism astounding.  course initial 300 million does, that’s contract about. 

5.1 simply states AstraZeneca give best effort produce within EU. can’t need use UK sites per 5.4. idea vaccine passports dead EU. least dystopian fantasy gone people still sense. Death hospitalizations rate children literally less regular flu. given appropriate PPE.

At school given 10 disposable masks bottle sanitizer. It’s isn’t RNA vaccine. 

This stupid reason, able recognize stupid reason. Boo hoo someone commenting public forum life *in relation subject post*. take someone talking life mean think they're person struggling this? dick reason. Right. COVID would like endemic COronas, literally noticed long time. Coronaviruses inherently bad, cause severe symptoms death EU requested AZ supply vaccines UK sites (which reserved uk) make shortage. contract demonstrates, request this. 

You need stop getting facts comments think it’s totally justified disappointed bit angry you’ve home year like have. understand risk groups need vaccine do, it’s definitely okay feel way. I’m perfectly fine waiting extra couple months honestly. waited long, want best best. fucking way I’m going lose sense smell taste early organ failure 50s inferior vaccine. Sure may die go hospital that’s something I’m willing risk/give shit I’ve past year. vaccinated mean completely immune virus cannot bring home contaminate family members disagree position.   would see local GP ask flu shot one kids, 'ld litterally ask ""Why?"". post above, copy-pasted guideline flu shots kids actual official healthcare website.

Child death flu something like 0.00006% per population here. seen undectected immune condition instead lack vaccination. Children known immune conditions get list contacted yearly vaccination. Pediatric deaths also countered vaccination. 

The US EU approach seem different probably causing similar discrepancy regarding covid19 vaccines. least know I'm downvoted now. get vaccine.

Also, said celebrities politicians publicly getting vaccine, true. would “severe illness” qualify nobody ended hospital died?  never said implied think, think anyone else thought, *only* ones struggling. people mental health issues man...? clearly goes beyond people talking anxiety covid. Canada not. Canada theoretically bought enough doses. Canada bought many knew supply disruptions may occur. Like story thread commenting on. every country. think teachers vaccinated ahead daycare workers prison guards instead time?

Inslee agrees state epidemiologists. think good company. That's stupid. on-brand him. worst argument I've heard while.

""you're analyzing things much! care raw numbers context whatsoever!""

Let make clear. One country learned early mistakes improved. One continued get worse. latter opportunity every single day save lives future, nothing. 

If one cared grandma, one would take lessons learned year ago apply them. Ignoring context inevitably means death. France's deaths way last year way short term increase Fall. US's time highs. think two comparable, proving point exactly. America failure regards pandemic apparently failure teaching critical thinking skills. Also: 


*""Poor Latino neighborhoods highly susceptible spread coronavirus dense housing, crowded living conditions higher proportion essential workers unable work home.""* guess good mine - perhaps profit made Pfizer. EU seem gone insane recently. Like said, depends closely related strains are.

They speculation people SARS-CoV-1 recent coronavirus-based cold immunity SARS-CoV-2.

If get weird mutation year likely candidates closely related actual spreaders, that's going limit effectiveness.

And also hard tell anything partial immunity data wise, people really go doctor minor illness. can't really quantify bad ""it would been"" without vaccine.

I said intentions dishonest wouldn’t prove anything; chiefly main point anybody Reddit knows nothing look stocks yeah could it. Hope so! DVTs fucking terrifying lol measures response new variants spreading. laws broken, they're enforcing contractual obligations people touting wanting get ""traditional"" vaccine spinning wheels. mRNA superior option tweaked easily provide boosters. Yeah, weird. Maybe nobody developed DVT despite within moderate category? Exactly, always knew December January would bad things tapering off. J&amp;J start shipping? find paper want least three hinted actually understand why. I've really busy time dive much. Yeah I'd much like know too. It'd nice information already could know many people get pneumonia covid groups, that's harder diagnose, though hard (need X-rays).

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* lower effectiveness, seems like best start high-spread groups rather high-risk groups. Save hardcore vaccines 65+ high-risk, give vaccines teens young adults already survive could use 2/3 chance get infected. known DVT going hospital though, I'm pretty sure. get true.

Anyways agree, I'm glad vaccine exists Yes 5.4 doesn’t expressly tie 5.1, doesn’t provide additional obligation use UK plants relation initial order. best say 5.4 general, applies Initial Europe Doses Optional Doses Additional Doses. conflict, Initial Europe Doses specified produced EU. specific provision prevails, resolve reading UK sites relevant Optional Doses Additional Doses. without consideration “best reasonable efforts” language, help AZ here.

There issues drafting, don’t really help basic point. either trust scientists medical professionals not. 

Dr. Fauci others promoting J&amp;J's vaccine effective important addition significant public health benefits. citation article right here.

You either trust scientists medical professionals not. “aMeRiCa BaD” 

Just lmao people say shit like this😂 Absolutly will.

By getting vaccines opening enough got decrease hospitalization rate. 

Should around Spring J&amp;J vaccine.

If don’t open, problem point one government overreach rather biology. None vaccines shown sterilizing. means vaccinated individuals plausibly transfer virus non-vaccinated individuals. yes, plausibly increases risk spread COVID. Makes sense! Thanks detailed reply. Seems like we’re looking pretty good timeline one way another. tbh really care since limited availability initially anyway, eventually enough mrna vaccines anyone US wants them. people want johnson johnson happily get april let move end line. 

it really becomes issue supply outpaces demand, would surprise since doubt people reddit even understand different vaccines developed. messaging campaign probably prudent becuase never know take social media, time i'm worried. misunderstanding mild case actually means. days symptoms done. problem virus physically damages organs, take months organs heal afterward, long virus totally gone. some, damage potentially years, even serious case (which happened bird flu). cases athletes getting heart attacks month got sick? highly symptomatic actively virus point attacks. takes heal damage, way takes heal broken arm. people put hearts lot strain post-covid damage, heart attack happens.

I've tested clean month yet still suffer odd fatigue stomach issues. true, mild case. Choose believe not! I'm interested getting virus again, even mild. Export, like do. Funny thing one gets anything. Lol. EU one actually exports vaccines.

Do people read Russia also exporting. Same. yeah expecting provide answer haha They've never sure vaccines stop transmission anyway (we constantly see articles may still able spread virus even vaccinated), see plan always go immunizing vast majority population virus simply dangerous anymore. rolled single dose make possible much faster. open everything country, already! one dose. widely available weird frozen storage. 85% effective preventing hospitalization death. evolution proven?

Yes.

The fact ask proof problem. Surgeons also dedicated training mask usage, specially sanitized pressurized rooms, generally mask surgery prevent liquid transfer, exactly aerosol. can’t really compare medical professionals masking admitting general public does; there’s much goes wearing mask two Idiot guy Idk man that’s trial abstract said. Jab daddy Shhh... think here. vaccine perfectly we're going back ""We yet see peak""?

CDC already claiming 90,000 deaths next four weeks, data calculated restrictions loosened nationwide. It’s amazing you’re able breathe information! ( lol) though would *like* believe we’re together, can’t bring believe that. 

You’ve got rich getting richer, millions literally jobless brink losing homes. (not all) government officials don’t even follow restrictions! especially pisses end. 

I’m tired. That’s really bottom line. Even though probably won’t necessary, fight freedoms need be. *not* losing senior year high school restrictions (class ‘22). important realize success MRAs set bar incredibly high... first vaccine announced single dose efficacy 70% would keep 100% recipients ICUs caskets, would lauded immense breakthrough. We’ve gotten lucky Pfe Md, people; especially us youngins, take WHATEVER vaccine get it’s available lack understand :)
This company sells good twice. absolutely zero signing contracts first, last moon.
I think biggest lesson learned self interest importent - coorporation. Thats sad reality. sure Biontech J&amp;J setup production UK needed. True, DVT severe. Wondering put complications could arise DVT severe DVT itself. Kinda weird though. 

Still. 100% prevention hospitalization death. great vaccine general/young/healthy population. see there's room. Partisanism empirical question answer to. Biden's approval goes 62% summer seriously surprised. Sounds like people still getting pretty sick enough go hospital. I'd shocked coughing/sneezing/having trouble breathing *not* contagious. responding post reports. responding post article. 

Are testing people symptoms randomly? schedule random people vaccinated group control group tested comparison?

As point, exposed virus get infected, yes. also exposed virus get infected, show little symptoms. means disease, caused virus. Testing positive indicate developed disease. Diagnosis disease requires medical professional.

You also probably need doctor (or even test) tell likely coughing, sniffling, can't smell taste. AZ contract, EU partnership Oxford, outright say company can't make profit. publicly traded company people know try. Suggesting EU good thing bringing price disingenuous. haggle price question saved. cost drug.

There 5 contracts + 2 potential contracts. AZ contract one EU made. based argument nothing said part quoted disingenuous. Actually looking numbers absolutely essential headlines ridiculously misleading. means nonexistent data.

 trials targeted younger volunteers since much speedier process vet elderly people many pre-existing conditions dealing extra isolation requirements individuals.

Imagine Macron around Edward Jenner injected child cowpox - ""the data suggests vaccine ineffective anyone age 8"" lol think everyone thread would love get Moderna. Lucky one Impressive target Two poorly fitting masks won’t make difference  love everyone place nationalistic tendencies lmao.

""The UK funded manufactured vaccine""

no, UK country, country cannot things, governments companies can.

if mean citizens UK, again, would simply living location guarantee supposed everything comes place, like vaccines? 

I love countries used synonymously people lol. Even edit pretty bold claim. saying this? remember thing. think thats likely. Summer probably one ages. know. I’m happy. situation changed. excuse, explanation. Sorry, bro. 

&amp;#x200B;

Party police station too. sure telling that. really subject discussion, since bringing up, fully support UK they're doing. proactive jn signing contracts took greater risk placing orders early on. paid off.  Nobody cares, care death rate lesser extent hospital capacity. got """"""""""mild"""""""""" Covid got long-term/chronic effects, well, problem. 60% time, works every time. 🤣🤣🤣 EU bad guys! Honestly, I'll take damn vaccine got point. Cuomo relying science pick earliest date open safely. /s agree 5.1 5.4 separate obligations. 5.1 use best reasonable endeavours deliver initial doses manufacturing within EU. 5.4 use best reasonable endeavours set necessary manufacturing capacity UK EU manufacture generally. 5.4 clear references EU include UK purposes Clause can't read UK 5.1.

So two distinct obligations:

1. AZ must try best deliver initial doses manufactured EU per Clause 5.1
2. AZ must try best set manufacturing capacity EU UK per Clause 5.4

Just second refers UK impose obligation respect first deliver UK. obligation still try best fulfill order EU manufacturing. could presumably choose provide doses approved facilities (which part 5.4 getting at) there's operative provision requires deliver UK, definition best reasonable endeavours contemplate AZ breach contracts (or behave commercially unreasonable manner) fulfill obligations UK facilities.

Also, yes 5.4 refer initial vaccine doses also optional vaccine doses. That's think reconcile two - 5.4 talking establishing manufacturing capacity generally initial doses optional doses. 5.1 talking delivery initial doses specifically. 

In terms likely intention parties - imagine 5.4 ensure set manufacturing EU UK contemplation UK capacity might used fulfill orders (particularly optional doses) line (e.g. UK order fulfilled), 5.1 commit AZ use UK capacity fulfil initial order (given UK contract parties knew time required AZ use UK capacity initially fulfil UK order). 

I think that's logical way reconcile clauses. EU considered this. actually done so. clear, 25k-40k day Canada like 200k-340k day US. Still really slow, though. makes feel better, we're jealous Israel. Wow biggest increase yet! administered vaccines (known) cases US.

IMO, vaccine distributed evenly. got shitting me. Child abuse? shit around forever. There's millions children exposed COVID may dealing long term health effects. That's fucking extremely concerning. Britain accused wanting “to start vaccine war” European commissioner Brussels claimed contract signed Astrazeneca proves right UK doses.

The European Union, mounting pressure stuttering vaccine programme, threatening block doses produced Europe going UK deepening row whether UK help meet shortfalls supply Astrazeneca vaccine.

Didier Reynders, Belgian EU commissioner, said: “Our goal European countries receive, time, vaccines proportion population. Transparency needed, vaccine war.

“Britain may want start vaccine war, programmed vaccines European countries partners.”

He added Brexit, UK taken decision “turn itself”. added: want help Europeans. would happened 27 gone ahead vaccine research? big countries would got something, others would stayed sidelines.”

Resentment UK’s relative success also made clear Croatian prime minister, Andrej Plenkovic. said: “What witnessing vaccine hijacking. countries didn’t united approach like EU obviously offered money vaccine doses.”

Astrazeneca insists cannot divert vaccine made Britain EU make shortfall caused production failures EU-based plants grounds bound promise prioritise UK government order.

The pharmaceutical company bowed pressure today published agreement bloc includes promise commitment third party prevents fulfilling EU order full.

Lawyers divided strength Brussels’s case, however, argument centring far Astrazeneca protected clause limits liability consistent “best efforts”.

The worsening spat came reported Astrazeneca vaccine set approved adults EU despite Germany saying would give jab over-65s insufficient evidence would protect them.

The bloc’s medical regulator said expected shot effective older adults basis antibody studies performance vaccines.

Emer Cooke, director European Medicines Agency (EMA), said vaccine “magic wand” would help ease crisis.

The authorisation came month EMA’s British counterpart gave green light vaccine.

Dr Cooke said delay caused complexity AstraZeneca’s results, spread across four clinical trials, two contain enough infections statistically meaningful.

The controversial element decision approval vaccine people age 55, make bulk priority groups many countries’ inoculation campaigns.

On Thursday German government’s vaccine committee published analysis trials showed two over-65s fallen ill Covid-19, rendering findings age group unusable. EU countries, including Belgium, may yet follow Germany’s example.

Bruno Sepodes, vice chairman EMA panel assessed evidence, agreed hard judge trials well vaccine worked older people said results suggested would effect.

“We don’t much information efficacy over-55s, data,” said. “Protection group expected based immune response results younger participants people given similar vaccines.”

Details failed effort compromise row Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical firm bloc sudden cut Covid supplies emerged today.

EU officials said cuts, blamed production problems Belgian plant, meant 31 million doses would produced period end March, 60 per cent reduction significant blow 27-member countries already lagging vaccination campaigns Israel, Britain United States.

The EU official told Reuters Astrazeneca offered increase deliveries possibly 39 million doses first quarter, deemed inadequate. contract agreed August, company supplied least 80 million doses EU period, official said, possibly even 120 million “depending read contract”.

A senior UK government official said nothing published contract alarmed lawyers.

Separately, plans give EU member states power block exports “risk triggering retaliatory actions third countries could rapidly erode essential supply chains,” International Chamber Commerce warned today.

“Such chain events . . . would devastating implications supply vaccines globally, including across EU member states,” wrote John Denton, ICC secretary general, letter EU commissioners health trade, Stella Kyriakides Valdis Dombrovskis, charge setting vaccine export licensing scheme. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

One prosperous decades history. think professor 100 percent correct. Bottom line - vaccines effective known mutations, getting vaccines every day. political ideology pushing urban density. Saying urban density= mask compliance vs burbs  dead wrong. Urban density objectively, making people living *dense city* comply? Promoting political ideology Urban density, whenever conditions immediately harmful puts vulnerable populations high risk catching covid witnessing community suffering, eyes. fun hear propaganda like place time... That’s good analogy. EU took parachute, happen crashing plane US booked every seat earlier flight. beef right EU you’re exactly covering glory here. Board members.

So investments I’m talking myself.

Most people things, whether work realize something like 60 percent Americans live paycheck paycheck.

This means nothing. know people make 200k live paycheck paycheck never stocks traditional savings. stock market means dick Americans. money given corporations reach them.

Incredibly wrong. Stop getting news reddit lol Pregnant women something like 18 times likely die COVID would think that's right call. 

I'm breastfeeding OB said recommending patients get offered. got mine last week (health care worker). | Big difference. even close example

Hawaiian residents travel outside Hawaii get tested return home Hawaii, too. Home Hawaii them. Hawaiian resident asked pay hotel California test comes back positive different example Michigan resident testing positive California pay hotel? Eeeh. could've boosted efficiency 85-90% two shots, think maybe focused that?

On hand, huge part world much easier time administring one dose. Good news you, USA, definitely option waiting little longer get mRNA vaccines. USA purchased enough. Raids factories? must missed that.

Astro Zeneca deserves blame promising. US UK implemented export ban 2020. EU also got export ban. Funny, yes? Estonia think ""thing past"". 

The way people talk pandemic interesting, least internet- people speak invented word ""pandemic"" March '20, we've never faced anything similar before, degree *forever ever change things life*. 

Think way- things around since dawn human civilization still around COVID. Int'l travel, getting together groups get drunk watch music/performances, vacations, etc. come back. We've dealt devastating Pandemics before- everything want come back happened those.

This sociology prof. predicts another ""roaring 20's"" boom entertainment, leisure, travel, etc., post COVID. think thats case. much easier solution would send disease spreaders boarding school 3 months, vaccinate adults absence, let return new world free virus. immunization required. called every single cvs east bay lol, everyone said can't manage it. grandmother go much all, worse comes worse it'll happen next month I'm sure.

שאלה לגבי משהסברת על ״לימד״: אם משתמשים ב-״את״ גם לפני המושא הישיר וגם לפני המושא העקיף, אז יהיו פסוקיות בהן מופיעה המילה ״את״ פעמיים, וחשבתי שזה אסור. בגלל זה השתמשתי ב-״ל-״ לפני המושא העקיף.

כלומר, אם שני המושאים במשפט שלי היו מיודעים, המשפט היה ל-״לימדת אותי את המילה החדשה״. האם זה מותר? keen insight obvious. operative word. hear horror stories media thrives fear, super common. Weren’t given substantial funding pursue vaccine? another company? spike mutations similar yes, what's troubling ability spread faster/escape immunity probably driving convergent evolution first place. Obviously. Belgium includes suspected covid deaths counts, whereas countries count deaths positive test. 

They've counting deaths differently begging people aware see articles. One shot makes smallll really quite unknown right now---the actual degree infection Manaus inferred, based empirical data, already demonstrated cases reinfection. good man. Sorry, reddit feeling particularly snarky today. US trial still open &amp; signing people up. giving 2/3 participants vaccine, 1/3 would wonderful reduced length illness virus shedding SA similar variants well would reduce spread &amp; save lives way well.

""Past infection early variants virus South Africa protect infection new one,’’ Madhi said. ""There seem protection derived.""

However, Novavax said starting develop version vaccine could specifically target mutations found South Africa...  Yes, however worth pointing Manaus strain South African strain, may similar mutations due convergent evolution, common ancestry. might possible infer mutations evolving part escape immunity original infection.

US? Yes butchered ways. company also let us go home theres way going shut plants haha.

My point sympathize also think 'only one friend' sees 'only friend family' family give shit sees everyone. Sure better seeing everyone, much better think.

It's people care really ruin it... 👍 Elvis Presley liked this. No, life nothing it. year two wearing mask, social distancing getting shit faced bars enough raise ""mental health stakes"", nothing anyone you. judging comments history master troll LMAO Italian variant?? Hahahahaha forgot thing  New Zealand island 5 million people. True.

&amp;#x200B;

Btw, true Italian variant early last year lethal South African/Brazilian/UK variants? think read somewhere. could explain masking appears work places others masks example worn visits.

The science behind masks working worn properly question always see practice.

Wearing mask nose example one common reason I've seen masks could lot less effective too. Though still help speaking somewhat.

Perhaps places require masking people closer together distancing important masking far effect?

We either need better way data make good conclusions exactly confounding factors are. time analyze data depth.

I'm glad tracked times government man would easy raw data social separation everyone every city data mask wearing appropriately mask worn. that's data science side itching haha would actually okay that. normal times would way hell AZ vaccine would get license 65+ olds. reason MHRA authorized pandemic perfect enemy good. Bleach mean Chinese vaccines? Curious 🤔
Because Chinese vaccines sure look like bleach+saline know that, bad. Nothing, see ever best case scenario vaccination better case countries closed effectively. countries also get vaccinated. People angry EU trashing vaccine, threatening steal it, also threatening block exports another vaccine UK paid for, EU got giant mess, ""Brexiteer trolls"". hope fine ever living shit do. 

I sick ignorant dumb fucks screwing economy dragging out. exist. India. think serum institute intentions selling doses EU AZ. understand three - masks, social distancing, handwashing - needed avoid covid. Masks need distance work best, plus want avoid getting eyes, handwashing (plus touching face) needed aerosols/droplets land hard surfaces like doorknobs, plastic packaging, shopping carts. Risk reduction cumulative, neglect one them, risk goes up. sorry hear falling :( 


It's really fair agree. effectiveness vaccine hospitalizations? everyone wants vaccine one, risk minimal time get life. turn vaccine get sick die, them. can't get enough doses. Still, vaccination rates per capita US three weeks ago. restrictions? Iowa open. Always been. Everybody expert problem. indeed committed supply certain amount vaccines, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said German radio. defense pharmaceutical company contract EU states must utmost correct, according committee so-called best effort clause applied period clear whether AstraZeneca could develop working vaccine. that, concrete quantities vaccine deliveries committed December 2020 first three quarters 2021, Von der Leyen possible outsiders check interpretation contract correct; EU AstraZeneca agreed keep contract secret. EU wants get rid agreement. contract may still public today, say insiders, permission AstraZeneca EU also working scheme stop export vaccines produced EU. suspected AstraZeneca solved production setbacks United Kingdom vaccines produced Netherlands Belgium, actually intended European market. EU paid AstraZeneca hundreds millions euros produce enough vaccine pending approval drug authorities. Later today, European Medicines Agency (EMA) decide whether vaccine approved use Europe.


Source: 
'AstraZeneca zegde EU wel vaccinhoeveelheden toe' - (Dutch) different vaccine

Is though? using spike protein expectation would developing antibodies identical sets epitopes. 1 kind vaccine using 4 different delivery methods.

To clear, agree point guy. Taking 'novel' novel coronavirus key reducing severity even develop perfect immunity. variants concerning, damning. EU average skewed Sweden France others terribly? What's median?  Denmark would like word you. infuriating, US bragging efficient vaccination... 
I polite saying slowing down, country, make new vaccination make sure people second shot...  Ah yes, notorious China propaganda arm, Lowy Institute! *Looks around Iowa.*

Source moderna effective SA variant? wouldn’t developing booster case.  Well, risk getting downvoted oblivion gall saying something negative teachers Reddit, here's think.

I think person learning dramatically effective distance learning school-age kids, especially younger ones.

I think prove especially true poorer kids one parent households, distance learning increase education gap there. think we're going see lot data come next couple years bad kids.

I think teachers' unions refused go back schools even attempts make safe possible used lever get front vaccination queue looked themselves, kids.

The next time teachers city (Chicago) strike better wages, benefits, etc, let mayor know oppose it. abdicated responsibility society. got first dose today, arm sore!! Interesting, friend older staying home, careful many problems gotten covid would expect bad first shot seemed way worse her. Yup super annoying, ads stuff trying convince everyone get vaccine point demand way outweighs supply really they're teasing everyone wants it.  Unfortunately know. appropriate covid subs frequent focus different type material.

Just know, got removed automod manual review youtube. posted mod discord server (because funny) one mods said remove good conscience left mod queue. Wherever post feeling going quite popular. really well done.  Professionals jobs. See: Cops, firefighters, healthcare,grocery, majority teachers want navel gaze....

And again, completely dismissing available science subject. Forgive causes question 'don't know'. Back first comment, starting vaccinations next week taking week two awesome March 1 start date. Particularly use Pfizer vaccine, would second doses start date. EU ordered 3 months latter needed to, problems tooling partner EU picked (being cheap) output lower. 

EU saw UK vaccination rates Scotland published confidential figures delivery numbers MI5 advice (as well secret storage location - Muppets). EU public hissy fit look bad.

 EU demanded AZ steel UK factories make numbers. got No, threatened stop different vaccine export UK Canada.

EU demanded publication confidential contracts prove hard figures deadlines, AZ called bluff on. Thursday sudden EU working together happy numbers getting Monday.

Germany best ignore huge amounts conventional wisdom enough people 65 getting infected trial, best ramp anti Vax feelings saying useful younger people.

UK Brexit remain people united theiving, lying EU.

Or EU may telling truth dull. Germany probably point well, point approving a.vaccine have.  Got second shot last week, 4 hours next morning sore joints fatigue. literally nothing, fared way better lot people. Good luck you! mention ton places straight impossible, infeasible (think anywhere eats hand mouth) eradicate. happens then?

Truth. don’t know wanted allowed talk us every day would better understanding bigger picture. Instead headlines dominated president talking HCQ. Fauci damage control point, setting agenda. damage bad. still bad.

Everyone acting like vaccine going save us sudden. things that-

The new variants spread faster. collective cognitive baseline 150k day caseload 300k day. best estimate able get 12% country vaccinated next months. Add roughly 25% natural immunity, give take waning resistance earlier exposure. That’s 1/3 portion resistance. Plenty room virus find new, unvaccinated, unexposed hosts *less time* used to.

You want some. know sucks means working. work known variants unless there's another SA variant heard of. Unfortunately, long-term effects even relatively mild case. feel bad COVID long haulers, especially ones otherwise young healthy.  USA! USA! USA! So.. vaccines recommended pregnant women now? Thought CNN headline writer sec need nasal spray breathe daily fml hard enough past year finding (and ridiculously expensive).  Exactly.

Many European countries sweep corona deaths rug. Plus, states testing easily available, many people tested multiple times. MN jobs requiring bi-weekly testing employees, tested repeatedly others never tested once. skews statistics. early go right ahead try make people angry. No, pandemic oven get vaccinated Feb 2021, millions still waiting line get protected.

Everything else madness.

We can't flush sacrifices everyone made last year Tokyo hellbent little sport spectacle like spiteful toddler. Silly me.

Big Pharma ones thank! many people expected attend? ever state views discussion\[?\] plainly stated Osterholm views deviant epidemiologists, meaning take views face value instead \[we should\] scrutinize them. That's literally logical science works, scrutinizing something show true untrue. Explain blindly accepting worst case less likely scenarios entertaining likely scenarios. make sense claim ""worst case"" view common sense. good portion US since Thanksgiving. come still 100% now? obviously gone way since dec 2019, 100 yet? 1M look back history books. Could 10M probably laugh suggestion long Covid bad. sure fucking hope everything else going country can't speak anyone else, use zoom much work I'm zoomed time I'm home. mentally exhausting way forms communication Masks least taxing option. Even without pandemic good reason wear one think might sick.

The fact western culture falters small piece cloth really speaks volumes. bunch people Biden's inauguration wearing two masks. Someone asked Fauci interview wearing two masks effective one, like ""yeah, probably"" two masks thing. Well, since one major comorbidities obese, mayhaps reopening gyms order. everyone room home safe parks exercise in. would go long way making whole country healthier.

Nah. Better keep gyms closed instead. Fitness healthy life habits bad. Pills, fad diets, surgery good. think realize many people risk groups. Quit selfish. ZA variant? Seems right - young population, less obesity, lots sunlight, BCG vaccine, possibility self medication steroids prevent serious cases. Lots factors going India compared Europe. maybe stupid idk

I teach title 1 fl required hybrid. kid class tested positive covid-19, kids within six feet quarantined two weeks. kids get quarantined access computers internet, they're getting education two weeks. county resources hand either. 

What's proposal? plan 

A. Providing child care 1o1 instruction k-5. need someone ensuring they're learning. can't expected sit front screen learn. That's stupid
B. Provide every child united states computer internet. Reliable internet, too. 

Otherwise, admitting willing fail generation kids offense, that's awful. whole thing gone long enough actually finished degree kitchen table, they'll mailing diploma sometime next month. ever go back campus alumnus, guess, far enough away distant anything else need visit seems unlikely short medium term. Still, knows? lot fun there, sometimes.

In case, hope find things enjoy WFH transition same, world come still offer new unexpected opportunities friendship us both. Thank sharing thoughts; least we've got platforms like this, good ill, appreciate people like making it. 2% Americans antibodies Dec 2019, year ago. Covid already around world Dec. done done even Chinese tried cover up. 

Give up. Wearing 1 mask 15 masks put covid away lifetimes. Also experts warn new Pyongyang variant  supposed get first shot 3 weeks ago, there's fucking vaccine available, another god damned lie make sure keep risking life make ""essential"" employers happy. whole thing bullshit. care low income kids pandemic? Also, guess disproportionately worse health outcomes disease? Low income folks.  failed every possible way least extreme death rate serves warning everyone decrying lockdown overreaction. reason worried people life telling wearing two masks sudden? question law diminishing returns didn’t apply masks? Yeah, that's science works. can't go back change trial parameters fact order get better number. I'm guessing yes. friend like well hard accept. best person could ever know miss wedding maid honor friends 27 years want postpone wedding anyone wear masks. young kids fly almost 2000 miles away pandemic. wanted postpone wouldn't. seen parents years plan visit time wedding, pre-pandemic. Same. Feels like I'm movie, Groundhog Day. Thanks explanation  11% weakened experience Covid.

Of course protects too. fact, vaccines far completed phase 3 clinical trials, think single person vaccine groups severe case COVID. It’s 10 versus 10. school half person half online (parents choice) it’s exact number kids send back person. wear masks teachers getting vaccinated next week testing plentiful close community spread picks up. 

Is risk? Totally. decision that’s quitting job is, it’s calculated one. visiting friends husbands parents haven’t met granddaughter 1 year old. haven’t haircut year get groceries curb side pickup. didn’t quit job guess hate kids terrible person. SC governor pitching fit demanding schools open 5 days f2f yet moved people line ahead teachers 🤷‍♀️ people it’s even *family members* going road. Even people formerly thought tethered reality, reason, compassion. don’t know hell happened, it’s heartbreaking see. Oh, yeah. don’t really kind thing. 

Be careful! It’ll okay. inconvenient. Fauci said get 60% reach herd immunity. response poll said said 50% people willing take vaccine. new poll came said 60% would take it, upped number 70%. new poll came said 70% would take vaccine upped number 80%, 90%.

He finally admitted giving percentages based science fact based thought people needed hear. longer scientist trying convince public things. vulnerable immunized hospitals longer strain zero reason economy cannot open back up. free continue make whatever personal choices want minimize risk, everyone else same. Incorrect. current working belief cause severe disease higher mortality rate.  Even Fauci commented study now.   see headlines August. Americans died COVID last five days, experts warn progress could undone people stop triple-masking grocery store! Stupid article post comment removed suitable r/coronavirus.

Please know alone frustration many people feel same. glad venting finding space share thoughts unfortunately, remove comment best-suited sub type discussion.

Well would depend positivity rate. positivity rate also low would say even low testing rates sufficient capturing infection rate.  Perhaps could offer vaccines buildings charities homeless come get food clothing. 


Happens metropolitan region Canada well.

Shelters apparently depressing somewhat unstable. people understandably depressed.

 Apparently theft rampant. Violence sexual assault apparently unfortunately uncommon. Also homeless people personalities many regular people would unwilling and/or unable stand around hour, much less several hours.

Also many shelters person security belongings. 

They also privacy.

Many people also able work part time due leave work 1 night order get sleep local shelters fill night. wife got moderna vax upset stomach well, said could ate lunch.lol   Everyone watches Big Game place.  titers convalescent serum also much higher Novavax Pfizer. Unless used significantly different panel convalescent serum, might indicate something... happening Yeah. saying subreddit wants hear ""shut stop upsetting people"". 

Except he's talking subreddit, he's talking rational adults capable listening opinion epidemiologist without crying incessantly.   never said could easily done. contend kids home working, zoom etc... saying government sincere getting thing draw close would necessary see done. quickest way get many people home x amount time virus choked off. stand statement people want put out. Recognizing difficulty families juggling speaking people even want wear mask two different things. said, parents grandparents made depression world war, it? need put heads together come solutions reduce amount time fighting thing. End summer/fall vaccine 50% people wanting take going rid us virus toll taking us. thread someone given example vaccine prevent transmission, Whooping cough (pertussis/ tdap) going change shot stop transmission. They're summer. Yes, fact got winter means past worst part. thought Rams lost Six top ten test per capita countries Europe, give larger countries testing much per capita many states. Pfizer 69% effective SA it? entire ethics commission political spending stopped commission early declared done. got re-elected. NYS doesn’t care (well downstate doesn’t) chance Pfizer completely unintentional supply issues, screw countries contracts set rule set? we’re back line...

Also nice try pinning Harper. You’re right conservative government, you’re well decade one. Mulroney rolled back vaccine manufacturing ability. Since liberals held government 18 years nothing change Mulroney did. Good stuff. I’ll see y’all there! Someone downvoted get. worries! I'm angry anything think one things lived see whole different side people expect.

Definitely keep staying home sick! That's great. totally understand people without paid time go work anyway begrudge people it-- that's system/governmental policy issue nothing people keep jobs.

My broad suggestion would get flu shot annually encourage others get it. Hopefully, post-covid, it'll easier explain important people. know able convince couple people finally get flu shots *for first time* year explaining flu vaccine works way covid vaccine work (in terms preventing serious illness lowering transmission risk)-- get one other? Sure. meant US certainly world leader response (to put mildly), I'm glad pandemic coming end country anyway. agree anyone wants vaccine able get vaccine.

(It's way, though, one main points article: ""A combination vaccination **and past infection** may immunize two-thirds America’s population virus middle 2021"". people behave recklessly also bringing us closer herd immunity.) Yea feel you, “friendship” end flames. party kept ditching zoom calls didn’t really make effort communicate months. happened beginning pandemic everything states getting scary. I’ve since moved on!  live Arizona.. :( work Youngtown, Arizona part largest county state, Maricopa. Wait thought said known deadly not? Preprint articles require higher degree scrutiny rigor accurately evaluate many types articles. kind discussion would appropriate strictly scientific subreddit /r/COVID19.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Hes one making policy frankly shut stop upsetting people. Yes, exactly. endgame make dangerous flu even less dangerous. That's pretty much it. got pfizer vaccine. felt great! highly recommend Get first dose 2nd February  I'm NYC lot people discussing reopening completely.

Schools open elementary students students disabilities.

I teach High School little 'parental intervention' whatever may lol Carowinds NC isn’t opening May 22nd gonna fuck ton restrictions does. fuck would necessary then? I’m mentally exhausted shit feels like it’s never going end I’m never gonna get enjoy anything again. got Moderna #1 day man arm hurt. thought reacting literally couldn’t move much. tried hahaha one year agree one well. part career gone job loses much enjoyment meaning. yeap, think thats best test, rather every1 hop plane roll dice Thankfully already states ever close normal since summer. many places children school, participating sports extracurricular activities, theme parks open, church service indoor person, restaurants bars, name it. Even many (most?) NFL teams college football, thousands fans seats, next weekend super bowl 22,000 including 7,500 vaccinated health care workers. 


In CA, among places, feels endless it’s not. Even New York restaurants schools opening, Chicago thing. least got outdoor dining week. worry new normal crap US going refreshingly normal summer, spring probably too. got second dose Pfizer vax Tuesday. felt awful Wednesday. bad couldn’t work. It’s similar reaction sometimes get get flu shot. slight shortness breath. Nothing major.This morning felt fine. Maybe bit tired . said wouldn’t hesitate again.  work hospital number people choosing get vax mind boggling. Almost 10 doses per 100 people US. Vaccination going better thought would tbh. Things slowly getting better 😌 Pfizer Novavax roughly compared GMT, also VNT MN 1 1 comparable. Moderna used GMC  job tell want hear honestly believes. something subreddit fucking incapable wrapping head around. fun

Answered question. Colorado governor epidemiologist? flat lie. Us still allowing travel Europe March 12th. Nobody flying fucking ridiculous. Sorry kids acceptable percent get one several-to-many covid mutant strains die disabled!
This sub swamped start disingenuous people shit posting somehow protect businesses beliefs well. derive lot meaning life expression music dance. Living like starved soul, exaggeration.  That's including HIV positive people. 60% without. Wow, even think camp - went week-long summer camp every year 8-18 kids arthritis, would've devastated miss that, especially since time saw people. Yeah saw NYT article 12-18 million, also heard White House briefing increasing 8.5 10 million. able find numbers. commitments Pfizer Moderna like ""100 million March"" give daily weekly figures. digging appears correct, nothing far suggests that. herd immunity pipe dream. way 25% country gets it, long hospitals overwhelmed we'd chilling anyway. going spread theres gonna new normal, we'll living like humans every period time becomes manageable. Im one them. enjoy going festivals fairs nothing look forward takes joy life. China deserves criticism get. I'm vaccinated; personally really give shit people long hospitalizations remain low, trying articulate Fauci saying since thread full outrage headline without listening Q&amp;A. young people hospitalization rate nowhere remotely close 5-10%. one data set.

0-4 0.02%
5-17 0.01%
18-29 0.08%

So many people completely exaggerated idea serious covid healthy people age 60. i'm reading far vaccines works least UK mutation even possible others, separating new virus? know transmits easily, vaccinations taking off, think panic much. U.S. vaccinating 1.5M people per day. Canada: essentially cutting reading wrong? general it’s even close. vast majority Europe low testing rates. friends flying sunday UK two weeks ago took PCR test friday got negative result (48 h flight). Saturday night dinner sister partner one them. Thursday knew partner sister positive one fever, tested positive weekend. Considering don’t know many Covid positive cases happened friends, makes think hundreds similar cases everyday, although 72 h prior testing better nothing. Nobody track trace contacted even try contact isolate people sitting near packed flight. Rightfully so. trivialize things people may prioritize important part lives. people may set activities keep fulfilled restrictions socialization, others don't. Maybe ball game concert matter lot people, others lives seem less fulfilling without things.

Music sports two things exceptionally influential society. They've reduced things life. trial US, approval depend likely choices aren’t either “literally don’t go outside all” “go huge parties friend’s houses every weekend” friends bought Xbox games game almost daily. There's always 4 6 us online. said hate photos videos taken myself, would say hell zoom. Sometimes play pokerstars chat discord. Basically audio,yes, video lol. also refuse video work camera video conf calls. 

So part making question friendship, worry it. mentioned three countries part EU global powerhouse Serbia using completely different vaccines. Death rates similarly bad metric here. rate death covid gone factor 2 3 due figuring treat it. countries cases last spring would look much worse. think \~75% estimate infected population might overshoot Brazilian virologist team (this might true, hoping best case scenario us). really reinfecting people, afraid vaccine stop one. getting vaccine let take mask public? opinion either way, kinda predict reddit respond something trump would like hear? want hear probably bad contradicted link. says downplayed herd immunity needed people give up, exaggerated it.

Also, that's non sequitur. deflecting away fact made moronic comment. Got first Pfizer shot last week. Nothing, nada, zip. pain, crappy feeling, nothing. even pain injection site. endless lockdowns? Nowhere Australia locked down. /r/askanamerican titers different papers cannot realy compared, used different assays Dr Fauci tell anything get wants.. lied us March last year want jeopardize ppe supplies... used excuse clear evidence masks effective time countries like South Korea effectively stifled virus mask wearing.
 
Im sure saying cover ass, maybe think telling people get free pass cause things open fast, maybe think people low priority rush vaccine think carblanche travel. case, placed near top priority list vaccination? I’m sorry, can’t imagine feeling right nobody deserves that. person dealt suicide stuff family, please hang there. It’s truly catastrophic everyone loves isn’t worth it, going end soon.

I hope heal this, realize weren’t enemies, people trying make time earth. You’re weak, you’re human shit sucks fatty. You’re alone. mind asking, bad upset stomach? opinion : Isolate father whilst maintaining social distancing / wear mask meet him. that, don’t scared don’t angry coworkers aren’t wearing masks. guess aren’t wearing masks mask advice place. saying 2 masks, saying cloth masks ok, saying N95/KN95, others saying 3 masks. Finally, don’t snitch, snitches get stitches. get second Pfizer dose anywhere 19 35 days first. 21 days “recommended” time. Wish college professors. Unfortunately university’s mom Facebook group seethes threatens pull funding thinking, tf would LA commenting Tampa Bay India better beware UN. UN Asia = China mouthpiece. african strain? mention, 131k people easier treat, thus decreasing mortality rate, little.  schools teaching right now, I'd favor putting line right elderly.

But demanding prioritized they're even school teaching bit much.

I obviously referring school teaching right now. next elderly. US doesn’t blanket export ban too. US, UK, doesn’t export anything. Poor Canada must import vaccines poor EU. what? direct ban. additional allowance. legitimate. 0.04 must PISSED  region that? guarantee open smaller Pacific nations first New Zealand.

No idea Asia Europe America tables fully vaccinated. Drive through? Damn France! don’t know we’re high list, 95% people consistently wear masks even outside... many things closed many people teleworking Yeah. And? Sweden made sound like harm good

Any benefit would better none

And honestly saying isn’t effective false narrative lot Asian countries western countries disproved. 

The actual effectiveness debated wide spread use lead lower slower cases call law primacy. People use persuasive speech education it’s effective. Stupid right?  US: within half year, rest world.. sadly could quite sounds like complete bullshit, we're worst probably shave beard want good seal. Get grip oh god lmao You’re idiot really believe 5+ years lol problem is?  That's happens let rip population. first dose Pfizer, little fatigued arm quite sore day, felt better day. 

The second dose, side effects 12 hours, suddenly got hit *everything*: fatigue, nausea, chills, migraines, muscle pains. felt like absolute shit. I’ve never flu imagine that’s like. symptoms lasted day, woke next morning 100% fine.

I heard second dose could worse first, still hit lot harder thought would. classmates types effects, others symptoms all.

If you’re getting second dose soon prepared potentially whole day. Still worth it! May 2021 likely vulnerable groups (especially people age 65+) fully vaccinated. keep hospitalizations deaths low permanently. point, see reason continuing restrictions, including mask mandates. 

But, hard predict future. trajectory vaccine distribution lot predictable public opinion. people decide done masks May 2021 mandates go away. thought MOPP suit civilian/industry equivalence, Type 3/4 coverall indeed tried it. problem I'll pass hot Australian summer and/or pour sweat shoes. advantage MOPP suit Type 3/4 coverall, wet decon.

I decided split difference wear long sleeve hoodies, long pants, gloves, respirators goggles perform dry decontamination door (strip outer clothing leave door) head straight showers. Basically [CDC's self-decontamination radiation emergency.   subject line made laugh ass off. Maybe hold horses considering history here. KN95 KF94 better speak touch mouth. They're also sturdy enough wearing cloth surgical mask top collapse them. much trouble, maybe I'm loudmouth. moment, lot countries slow vaccination rate vaccine available...  literally everybody specific instance, one it. 

Does someone need explain antibodies work? Wait, Australia New Zealand count Western countries? hemisphere thing cultural? \*billions CNN cover it? Welcome geographic purgatory countries debatable locations like Turkey hang out.  won’t be. UK variant dominant, really bad thing since vaccine works good it.

Also, Pfizer vaccine works really well SA variant.

If anybody tells wear masks forever, tell go fuck themselves. Oh, makes sense. countries making risk-reward analysis around deaths per day. Australia's risk-reward analysis going different.  wish teachers would we're getting sent back 5-day week school Monday area almost 15% positivity rate ???

The US certainly lockdown since April. periods areas/states restrictions and/or stay-at-Home orders, yes. claim, however, US experienced real lock hyperbolic best. article say “large” western countries See response. came say exactly that. would ironic. Gets hit hardest, recovers quickest. Also seems American.   wow longest estimate read far...so Covid news would still dominate Biden's first term think so. think self-reported thing. told go cdc website report it. ""gotten around"" it, think I'll her. NP saw night, however, said seeing lot Moderna vaccine particular. actually happens right two-week mark first shot. Luckily I'm RN caught airway restriction could occur. advised still get second shot completing prednisone dose taking benadryl solid week. instructed take benadryl second shot. Monday. Flu like symptoms, swelling, facial flushing uncontrollable itching entire body. I'm still watching like hawk. well could much prevalent reported, first round vaccines went medical staff, RNs, MDs, ect. half dead get RN MD go doctor something know treat home OTC meds. pride thing. We're stupid lol. delay ffs Oregon, last time checked lowest case count state territory island. losing businesses left right. One restaurant owner talked digging deep emergency savings try stay afloat. Portland's famous restaurants gone business, one lost head chef big draw coronavirus.  North America best America. Moderna going start producing Spain EU soon. worry, envy Canadians everything else. guy says nationalism relatively new totally correct. look history nationalism, won’t find anything city states in-group loyalty, etc. Nationalism historical force tended destroy city states dynastic entities focus prenationalist loyalties replace new, distinctively national states. Think unification Germany Italy, dissolution multinational empires (Ottoman Empire, Habsburg empire etc.)...  hoping diving helmets mandated next sorry losses. North America? doubt it. People still behaving, vaccines comparatively far between. It'll almost definitely 5+ years back pre-covid life. Ugh sucks I'm sorry. =(

I university classroom (before Covid) least TA could help keep chat. adults. mic long cord could move around. would still miss comments at-home students feels bad. 15-20 students together days. 

So sad Americans can't see stuffing ton students classroom going get education smaller classes will. 

Anyway late I'm rambling, good point computer still think worth considering outdoor classes places remote learning. I’m trial! Glad help gather data (hopefully vaccine saline!).

I wonder find after, save doses others? mean total worldwide graph? We're certainly past December peak, that's sure, personally encouraged first time daily cases genuinely decreased. disclude possibility another spike happens larger last one. said, vaccinations going way are, consider unlikely- we've hopefully got couple months refractory period, hope vaccinate enough next spike happen, least accompanied lot deaths.  curious - got pfizer today - 2nd one 21 days? typo comment 2/18 instead 2/28? laughed loud brainwashed Fauci. Anybody still listens point fool. numbers showing decrease infections. lift restrictions.

“The patient starting get better! Time stop medication.” politics: competent messenger often valuable competent technician.

This revealed near sighted people wore glasses China less likely get Coronavirus. says there’s enough info conclusively recommend wearing eye protection. think that’s bad recommendation. wearing eye protection causes harm, might provide protection virus, opinion would pretty logical protect eyes. best mask world would meaningless end getting infected virus particles landing eyes causing infection.  took 400k+ lives better those, I've gone full [NBC Someone else mentioned r/covidvaccinated Maybe it’s retirees get actual risk hospitalization and/or death Yes confused? topic mask mandates. allow people go safely, claim want. like odds.

So no, misleading. arrogance win lot discussions you?  Yes be, collaboration much better. Let's assume Us EU fully vaccinated end summer, best case scenario, give vaccine less developed countries end new variant next winter. one basicly understands it. Originally first world countries countries allied US cold war, second world countries allied USSR third world countries playing game. definitions obsolete now. Still targetable new vaccines therapies though. Also, variant presumably evade natural antibodies post infection. I'd rather sit fence go far that. long immunity last done covid 19 isolation? company's preliminary analysis indicated variant first identified U.K., called B.1.1.7, detected 50% confirmed cases. Novavax said results showed vaccine 95.6% effective original COVID-19 strain, 85.6% U.K. level protection lower smaller, mid-stage trial conducted South Africa. study enrolled 4,400 patients September mid-January, time B.1.351 variant, contains critical mutations along virus' spike protein, spreading rapidly Overall efficacy 49.4% trial, figure rose 60% among 94% trial participants HIV-negative. False. Pfizer CEO son Holocaust survivors. Also Israel struck deal Pfizer provide data exchange doses. [here's politico article said much first time saw Reddit day.

And one guys found already dead? ... 
Uhoh.. European Commission today makes contract pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca public, sources confirm NOS. Parts contract blackened. ""But interest parties keep disputed parts legible, prove right,"" said correspondent Thomas Spekschoor.   EU previously asked AstraZeneca make contract public. two sides clash delivery vaccine. Earlier month, AstraZeneca unexpectedly reported pharmaceutical company deliver 80 million, 30 million vaccines 27 EU countries first quarter.   AstraZeneca, contract EU merely states must utmost meet promised deliveries. EU suspects vaccines produced Netherlands Belgium used deal production setbacks United Kingdom.   offered EU additional 8 million doses first quarter, according Reuters news agency. According EU, enough, still much less agreed delivery.

Contract tussen EU en AstraZeneca vandaag openbaar - (Dutch) Sweden scarcely populated much like Finland Norway, similar kind epidemic level. Yet sweden 10x deaths Norway Finland, 5-6x cases Norway Finland. familiar term ""western country""? post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Well, AZ going make contract public today, we'll see. Absolutely loving living EU get benefit rolling, never-ending lockdowns curfews mental health destruction, absolutely stupid vaccine roll-out schedule. economy, hospitals, never overwhelmed, goal.

As economy, ample science negative health effects economic crisis:  Nah, discussion ends here. Thats smart response. I've wearing double masks since May, paper masks keep getting mask acne plus cloth mask top forces paper mask closer face. Don’t tell kiddo!...LOL! Read response German Health Ministry says PISA Israeli education. Israelis know world map evolution works. Standardized tests good studying standardized tests. They're two independent contracts bearing other. timing signing matter all. AstraZeneca signed contradicting contracts, fucked big time. Certainly. EU take doses UK, also short. AZ explain everything. way, use term steal quite imprecisely. always figured properly fitted N95s much better anyway, zero connection healthcare industry know available not. Buying online seemed shady. 1. logical one
2. No. German government source released false information. Anonymous briefings happen great deal. 
3. agree promote ""anti-vaxx""? cares? dominant vaccine Pfizer Moderna. give shit Novax it’s even widely used anywhere? Really don’t understand “we rush get vaccinated” mindset Australia NZ. disaster waiting happen. know covid hits basically everywhere point it’s bit silly rest laurels this

I get it, island hard lockdown was/is fantastically well done. still doesn’t mean shouldn’t trying vaccinate risk asap Bullshit, seen fucked America beent whole time. may well recover covid byt missed mark crushing covid long ago. Still doesn’t mean EU fucked anything. think UK fucked WAY giving elderly vaccine hasn’t tested them. Absolutely ridiculous IMHO criminal. 

Oh please. may lack efficacy data lack safety data. extremely safe vaccine, giving 65s therefore extremely low risk. protection point better protection. efficacy turns low, revaccinated something else later. fact lot vaccine available right now, criminal act would put people's Still doesn’t mean EU fucked anythin

The EU delayed three months. production could three months ahead situation would even exist. EU bureaucracy slow that's vaccine programme far behind US UK. *still* negotiating things like Novavax. mistake AZ. committed many doses. EU would fine - even hapy - signed 30M doses. signed 80M - 120M, angry. Really dont time teach utilitarianism engage circular discussion. 

The EU citizens die fuckup thing.. brilliant. Smart dude. Read really fucked point. 

Also really smart comment contract read it.  Highly unlikely. question EU going steal UK's vaccines not. That's higher education small handful go there. look PISA results 2018 (international assessment 15 year old student reading, science math skills) see Israel well OECD average way USA

 That’s basically never messaging *will canceled. first countries open borders basically natural immunity another massive hard lockdown months Aus. need decide vaccination rate needed risk opening borders legitimatly potentially reset EU long history lying asses cover dysfunctional are. trust used car salesmen EU. there’s 4000+ cases 90+ deaths per day. Jesus article link bloated ads shite Oxford vaccine 60% efficacy. Might ones lose end. What? There's confirmed SARS survivors actually know ""immunity""? cross reactive antibodies isolated SARS patient used SARS2 monoclonal treatments could possibly assume least people may developed cross reactive immunity. also similar virus. 

I meant endemic coronaviruses, OC43, 229E, HKU1, NL63. live??? majority people around me... yes, contributed problem bigly. EU claims contract. contract revealed. AZ denies said facilities mentioned increase deliveries UK's order fulfilled.

Arguing what's contract matter fact pointless published. Like what?  Yea saw tall mean mugging douche bag NY license plate NJ vax clinic. Australia 'Western' nation? normal American propaganda. know. look detailed plans country, think. Looks alright you’d wanna layer something little better  think Australia obviously much better right now, one legitimately concerned looks like vaccinations really take lot time. There’s real reason think essential transport won’t nring back every month Astra Zeneca needs decide British company international one. words. 

Its right stop export vaccines companies fucking EU UK still insisting receiving quantity, rather sharing success. see fuckup side EU think pretty interesting UK media perhaps nationalism influenced there. People really F whole New Zealand example. 

NZ tiny, remote, island nation. fucking course able get near zero cases early. Dont pretend like could handle better NZ size US Yes, EU claims relevant best effort clause, AZ since admitted exact delivery numbers dates. say EU messed up, mean took months actually place order. they'd ordered early, production would three months ahead whole stupid situation would exist. visited Israel, definitely western. love Israeli brothers tho (and amazing falafel). think mask ordered good one? really want N95 mask cause pain clean find hard breath (I've tried one before), figured I'd get cloth mask that, according study, nearly effective N95 mask. AZ isn’t we’ve bet on, trouble. Maybe Novavax, ability scale manufacturing unknown.

 Official details actual agreements here: post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Cost what?  keep seeing this, really clear means.

Because cost produce vaccine sell twice many doses.  Things like staff costs, equipment amortization cost raw materials different depending quantities.  

Considering fixed prices agreed upfront several contracts; see AZ benefitting financially selling more. best effort clause, EU comes last, knew signed. never changed. best effort clause. immunity works. Herd immunity always well slowing it’s massive tipping point spread nosedives Yep, remember US pumped trillion stock market barely helped week? dragged it’s feet getting real people help? remember.  rather sending 3rd world countries neighbourhood, SEA, Africa Latin America. pharma industry one hope.

EU rich enough buy/manufacture vaccines sheer incompetence shown. Fatty McFuck Face get fucked. Australian coastline length - 35,877 km.

United States coastline length - 19,812km. 

It's also generally easier monitor land border entire coastline.

But credence due, United States Australia. fair compare them. There's many variables play even ballpark. study find efficacy 8%. enough data study make claim efficacy. confidence interval low -1405%! equally valid headline would vaccine *promotes* infection rather protects it.  feel like new plan huge slap face people disabilities essential workers like (albeit young) still go work everyday random person in, say, 50 age bracket could probably working home 65+ older probably retired stay home. absolutely agree 65+ first prioritized though understand greatest risk dying COVID-19.

And hit nail head here, tough decisions made, vaccinate reduce total destruction covid, peace mind essential workers miniscule tangible benefit highest priority. Also, mortality rate making case, 80% deaths 65+. Clearly still massively destroyed Covid, *in spite* rationalizations put supposed Tier 1b, looks like I'm getting pushed back end line based age (29). Seriously, say high-risk people still work?

So proposing vaccinate essential workers get microscopic cohort like chemo quit already? pretty flawed argument vaccinating essential workers. flaws vaccination plan probably always small cohort screwed over, targeting populations devastated sound strategy. main argument forgoing plan reduces deaths revolves around essential workers getting repeatedly screwed over, argument rethought. really fair, EU throwing temper tantrum get want, really shocked tbh. think missed word ""parties"" Super Bowl.
Oh wait, didn't. click bait. I’m lucky enough heavy duty n95 mask it’s definitely one plan wear even said that. Boris Johnson said, ""we confident contract supply"".

It's refusing export. UK already ownership first 100m doses produced there. Agree. chance get AZ UK.

But give 99% chance EU export ban vaccine. fair. 1. Assumption

2. No, ""secret person government"" (have link original article, btw?) representative German state. Thats dumb shit assume much. government make official communication random magazines. realize government communication goes specific channels every elected official (and barely individual elected official) even right speak behalf Germany? assume not.

3. make claim propaganda true. Whenever husband wears mask (a lot), say “oh wow, sexy man makes public health problem” 🤤 

(It actually me, though). 😁 UK placed order first. Almost immediately order, AZ spun EU production, could UK paid it. EU production would even behind UK hadnd't ordered.

Also, plants refer to, owned AZ, British company. implication UK's tiny shipment December stolen EU totally false. even stolen, nowhere near enough explain shortfall. like UK got 75m doses meant go Beyond that, UK already vaccinated vulnerable far ahead Europe

No hasn't. vulnerable groups done April long ""friends"" try steal would pretty stupid UK try cooperate here. FAR weaker party, too.

In terms vaccinations, much stronger position. EU one desperation here. even appear approached UK directly. Instead publicly imply they're going take it. really poor diplomacy, they're great job making look like villains. They've also sent clear message companies reliable place build new pharmaceutical facilities they're quite willing block exports prevent fulfilling contracts. Stop shaming people this. 

Vaccines arm always better vaccines trash. Yeah, parents crank kids, responsible all.

The hilarious part argument pretend make women's rights issue. fooling anyone.  logic, it’s unconscionable worker works face face. Yet many throughout pandemic. Vaccine limited average teacher lower risk profile groups currently vaccinated. 

It’s unfortunate situation everyone can’t get vaccinated yet. yeah, makes sense choose self isolating prevent getting virus injecting untested vaccine themselves, they'd pick isolation. seems logical point game get data vaccines pregnant people specifically. Nah, flamed reddit told selfish sociopathic hypothetical grandma killer see anyone. Hey make mistakes. I've always struggled addiction. I'm trying better quit years. fuck judging. I'm sure always perfect. Wish people would understand this. saying people aren’t brain fog comparing early dementia wild accusation. Sure can. Granted, kid home useless parents, there's polishing turd. Guess what? Even population school kids underperforming same.

Is remote instruction person? Obviously not. It'll safely open schools though. necessarily supply chains. EU signed buying vaccines, get guaranteed delivery dates part contract. specifically issue Astrazeneca/Univ Oxford vaccine. UK signed first, guaranteed delivery dates frome existing manufacturing facilities. EU supposed get deliveries upcoming factories, behind schedule. Even goes on, vaccine (Oxford) approved EU medical authorities (expected today/tomorrow). that’s despite bailed summer July holidays. social events home issue. seen several articles linking severe covid-19 genetics. Here's I’d like see changed 100M *people* vaccinated 100 days. 

But may even possible supply-wise.  Vietnam never outbreak like Melbourne Wuhan. point, strict lockdown city would seeded outbreaks people left area, either avoid lockdown isolate comfortable quarters, happened everywhere else major outbreaks. Lockdown becomes less effective even first city eliminate it, would inevitably reimported. Locking entire country evenly breeds discontent cynicism problem 1000 miles away. time virus gets people, they've already stopped caring. like holidays dude. People gonna get together party. *A cleaner pulled plug vaccine cooling.
*The largest vaccine factory India fire.
*Some Oregon moved teachers elderly.  sunset conditions met? 

(Your ICU demand absurd btw) It’s outdated term Cold War. Basically means North America Western Europe (Australia/New Zealand debatable would consider western due association UK) Chronic dandruff? Believe not, COVID. called getting wait-list, damn receptionist primary care doc's office said getting vaccine heard size effects ☹️ heck can’t delay Super Bowl late spring, people could watch outdoors, instead early February pandemic??? Greed everything, Amiright??? Mine scheduled 2/6 10:30 p.m. (They give vaccinations 24/7 AZ &amp; managed grab late night appt.) going public places &amp; then. highly contagious strain floating around, want catch go appt. can't defend position? even one.

Teachers teaching remotely effectivity pandemic. three kids, I've seen first hand.

Are populations need person schooling others? Absolutely, schools limit attendance demographic prioritize vaccinating teachers school staff members first. accommodate special needs, daycare requirements housing/did security issues.

Nobody gives shit tantrums taxpayers willing pitch. Teachers started striking get worse people start forcing choose jobs safety. shortage teachers nationwide already alarming rate worsen situation moves forward. Yep, that’s super fucked up. better. Sweden 1,137 per million.       
   
Denmark 339 per million.  
Finland 120 per million.   
Norway 102 per million.  
France 1,144.   
Germany 670
   
US 1,336 per million. Big difference America capacity manufacture mRNA vaccines locally. sure hope so. fucked every single part pandemic, I'm thrilled seeing us get part right   People use Western oecd interchangeably typically. analogy like imagining didn’t cars time last year, sudden cars invented people run schools telling teachers get school car fired. normal school year, treated such. yes, death otherwise low risk job high risk many deaths.

I think part people aren’t classroom don’t realize looks like actually get back building. I’ve teaching in-person since October. came back fall break, made one week, shut three grades amount cases school. got back two weeks later, made one week, shut - one carried us winter break. prepped come back winter break, night district pulled plug. we’re numbers twice high saying unsafe beginning school year they’re trying send us back. students stayed virtual entire year ahead students constantly context switched entire year. think consistency impactful point in-person short burst inevitably shut don’t enough non-exposed staff run school.

Edit: “were telling them” “were telling teachers.” children appear less likely spread virus, leading Dr. Wiedermann say reopening schools precautionary measures could done safely D.C. region.

I'm suspicious preceding statement. What's cutoff age ""younger children"" transmit virus? You? written Asia Times bet get nearly 200 million doses arms May! Take that, variants! Full body blood vessel disease. bears repeating, especially consider many blood vessels brain. 100 million coming US! Nobody thought pandemic would over. expect restrictions long way messaged beginning. Ah. Good ole Republicans punishing local governments making decisions like saying local governments make decisions. title Hey, German here, we've trashing US past year, suddenly think share vaccines ""I don’t understand risk lives we’re close vaccine,"" Chicago teacher said.

How fuck adult agree this? everyone else still work non/remotely pandemic. problem updating vaccine, would slow global vaccination rate already vaccined people use production ressources. Started seeing people without masks. Stores Fl lifted requirement. say 50 years theyre acting like 1 year olds right? Except correlates co-morbidities well. obese 35 year old smoker heart condition risk bad outcome reasonably healthy, fit 55 year old.  Fortunately really become problematic antigenic drift like this.

It's issue weird spot similar significantly different like different influenza viruses like H1N1 H3N2. However vaccinated/infected different clades / subclades within may actually hone immune system target conserved parts virus give broader spectrum immunity.

I would think might problem infected endemic coronaviruses first, been. young chance evaded infection these. Yo, realize unarguable right? fact lol. need aggressive it. vaccine way that's that. Masks ineffective anyone wears clearly selfish. wearing face shields they're actual impermeable physical barrier. let's say made policy.

We move Yellow level Green level current hospitilizations 300, ICU availbility 20%, 7 day rolling average cases 600 45% adult population vaccinated.

You think that's fine policy? Palestine doesnt want help. system acquiring vaccines. make right thing do.

Yet smoked 25 years. Interesting people make statements literally zero research India. light symptoms (so far) must attention issues lie parents? they’re paying attention solution parents sitting them! solution get back school teachers deal person. 

Most parents can’t work virtually. virtual school means stay home baby sit children means they’re working make money family. Less money means stress, less career advancement, financial stress still pay school taxes, hurts women especially, etc. Even work virtually it’s incredibly distracting help kids teacher job day long. Gotcha. understand &amp; thanks answering! title says ""The first 22M Americans..."" article takes account exclusively data USA, instead American countries.   thought current covid vaccines based SARS/MERS vaccine platforms-how planning trialling vaccines way disease barely exists wild anymore? would done challenge trials? unprecedented. Lol. Great job!! Fantastic oerformance Vietnam nearly 4x population. Australia 2,237% larger size.

I'm sure point someone say, Australia island. someone else say, really continent.

I'm certainly opposed methods Australia though, highlighted another user. common sense. Nothing come Americans football though mean great anti-science state Connecticut /s I’m currently working someone who’s job behind scenes research type stuff explanation bigger reaction, better immune response. 20 year old probably better protected vaccine least protected sooner. would crazy plan either know Minnesota answer, trouble.....  DROPPING, BOYS? mean Jose Maria, Sam Diane lost everything trying work help kids virtual schooling year. Schools vital part infustructure. everyone laughing Oklahoma yesterday. true. virus magically disappear herd immunity. That's point begins slow own. Gotcha, thanks explanation actually think great vaccination campaigns already started. Millions americans saying they'll refuse vaccine MAJOR problem. faith enough people come around, going take work. need start educating vaccine deniers immediately going change minds overnight. catch mean immune. know multiple people twice already symptoms times lot Americans trouble admitting America isn’t best everything mRNA vaccines code small incomplete number virus' proteins. scientifically impossible assemble actually replicating virus could cause damage. Given 22m people US already vaccinated, **zero** rational debate risk vaccinated vs risk getting infected virus.

This question akin calling fire dept house fire, asking risk asking work schedule hybrid? Honestly curious. didnt think anyone going back full time % increase [excess comparing US EU countries, EU tends big spikes fall (Spain hit 156% excess mortality April). US turn consistently bad. Every week least 10% excess mortality. Found person didn’t read article! real issue people wearing one still. city 99 percent wear them. less dense areas people aren't, despite close interaction people day.  Thank that. I’m one dorky people completely forgotten talk humans really appreciate little interactions. cannot effectively teach young children virtually despite teacher anecdotes contrary. think kindergarten online close substitute person? 2nd grade? They’re not. time get close high school. really can’t defend position. People don’t take teachers seriously argue kindergarteners great virtual schooling. 

Teachers also like avoid recognizing one component school day care. Day care allows parents go work, make money family, pay government taxes used pay schools. Virtual school means lots small kids whose mothers fathers quit non-remote jobs babysit them. cannot leave small children alone. families stressed - still get pay school taxes despite earning less.

Modern families two parents working non-remotely need person schooling children. Schools empower women. Government needs person schools keep tax revenue lower unemployment related spending.

Parents still pay school taxes schools person component. Meanwhile many go every day jobs earn money pay things school tax. isn’t much support virtual schooling anymore even Biden teacher union support reopening aren’t part 100 day plan. Voters want schools open. CDC fauci say kids better school. It’s happening soon. 

Vaccine argument sounds nice realize many people also get work around people daily - throughout pandemic unlike many teachers. Vaccines limited supply sounds nice vaccinate teachers reopening would mean group loses out. people going grocery stores workers need vaccines, too. daycare workers, homeless shelter workers, prisoners prison guards, factory workers. essential employees died teachers, get much sympathy media. Inslee right get workers 50 65's. Teachers vital communities, people holding infustructure, they've whole time mess. simply enough vaccine everyone, teachers 50 low risk. Theyre environment way safer most. certainly need get essential workers fast possible. get second dose February 4th actually used term incorrectly. law basically says large sample size, get true average population. 

That quite meant. meant was, basically, lot little lot. 2% sounds like big deal, 100 people, really isn't. 2% of, instance, 5,000,000 people (roughly metro Atlanta Boston San Francisco Detroit), 100,000 dead. 

You frequently seen idea thrown around - ""Only"" 2% mortality rate therefore big deal - 100k dead big deal. (Or whatever mortality rate actually is, see ton different numbers sh!tty facebook posts). 

&amp;#x200B;

My post saying worry sample size small enough - instance, 0.04% people get virus (hahaha, could get anywhere close 100% people taking it) even everyone US exposed, 131k would get virus, 2% less 3,000 people dead. big deal. Reddit America bad Ugh. feel way family. I’m never going forget selfish, mean dumb they’ve pandemic people washing groceries hands. scientists jumped told people start nobody would things. teachers next group vaccinated 65+, doesn’t mean schools right teaching meantime. community. catch circulates. That’s covid trials gone quicker trials— much circulating virus allow trials test enough people. Source? cool million even substantial India? It’s less 0.1% population. Good see quick start though: empty bus.

Experts Sweden considered masks necessary unless specific circumstances, repeatedly recommended avoid circumstances much possible. Makes sense. I'm NorCal. 2 people mentioned got sick Feb still strictest know shelter place even though think got covid already. one (elderly relative) deceased. Aren’t country produces 75% vaccines drugs? think informed people tell like war time rationing WW2 ban commerical passenger flights month two shortly horrible events 9/11. Restrictions purely temporary measure done moral necessity necessary evil order stop spread Covid 19 save lives preventable causes.

If United States many countries locked hard 4 months like Australia done soft lockdown afterwards (like 6 feet people different tables restaurants face masks limited number customers stores) Covid 19 would likely nearly completely contained  know Sweden, know that’s true statement. Calif. (Reuters) - Rose Hills Memorial Park Mortuary Whittier, California, may biggest cemetery North America 1,400-acre park struggling cope number bodies awaiting funeral services due increase COVID-19 numerous facilities Rose Hills, month’s delay families receive funeral services loved Monroe, CEO president Rose Hills, told Reuters via Zoom sharp increase services since Thanksgiving holiday November, demand nearly Hills brought large number refrigeration units deal additional park also set tented areas replace on-site chapels using new methods like livestreaming bring services can’t replace hug,” said Monroe. “There’s old saying grief shared grief diminished ... can’t really well Zoom.”

.....

Article continues perfectly reasonable compare country neighbors similar economics, demographics, health systems climate. done time kinds purposes. difference mainly come government reacted covid.  Yeah, would seem logical could catch two strains rampant novel you. Catching separately would much concerning.

But reading article biggest issue meetup multiple strains like speed mutation. r/SelfAwarewolves AZ while, using Cobra biologics help manufacture Keele example.  anything ever gets done

ahahaha bold u assume Mainly EU exports vaccine world. Leaders vaccination, US UK ban vaccine export. harsh true. cannot get zero covid strategy millions cases. Maybe thousand, now. Useless parents? crock shit comment. every parent trained educator. go try someone else's job call useless. better believe it. Mrs Miggins 33 Station Road variant particularly nasty one. Good bot don’t understand comment got downvotes. It’s good news, it’s truth. 

The new strains could muddle everything up. Fingers crossed booster shots come quickly new strains emerge mean time. People make argument often assume person learning COVID quality before. fundamentally false. Poor communication ability, distancing requirements, different students teachers classrooms quarantining day, switching among person amd hybrid modes, teachers spread like 12 scenarios (in person / hybrid / virtual schedule + person / virtual plan students + students temporarily quantining / teacher temporarily quarantining) ... bit reduces overall quality burns teachers even faster. 

Without ability effectively discussions collaborate way person, instead making pretty much talk students 40 minutes, personally find virtual work better. Everyone actually see other's faces talk way. course, depend class, teacher, students, district, technology, realize case everywhere. 

I'm saying argument whole cut dry one way other, lot factors many seem consider. Sweden, like Denmark Norway Finland, sparsely populated dense Germany France UK

This misleading. Obviously vast empty areas lapland contribute spread. sweden, large percentage population concentrated around stockholm metropolitan area cities. ? please actually look information. 40% last week it’s 60%. California great rollout considering population density factors, spread California’s population is. numerous counties upwards 500,000 people it. Mark words California known state best overall vaccine rollout within next months. likely. Japan even South Korea kinda weird category, too

the difference geographic West geopolitical West going mass vaccination programme everyone avoid panic false sense security people got vaccinated well others.

Our 50 million vaccines 25 million people arrive next month. mandatory vaccination programmes schools, hospitals, emergency services public-facing roles, healthcare infrastructure slam thousands people per day. also free btw.

Hopefully us NZ complete clear July. would Novavax study South Africa found previous infection original form virus causes COVID-19 may completely protect people becoming infected mutated version later on. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* definitely think late autumn cons around, vast majority vaxxable americans ready then? California's plan calls 65+ crowd get vaccinated ASAP. problem IMO happens that. intention simply continue going age, completely ignores fact certain co-morbidities (kidney disease, heart disease, cancer, etc.) increase risk bad outcome regardless age. 

Data here: Yes, curfews hinder *already* spread virus. better solution would be, instead targetting harmless activities (a jog park, stargazing, bakeries remaining open 20h), targetting directly harmful (i.e. indoors meetings 5 people). less enforceable (which government it), least people know exactly avoid, better bad law lots incentives people disregard (and pointlessly turn criminals). absolutely zero optimism future choices government (see: war drugs). Masks dont make pandemic go away impact, several studies it. course, facemask gives limited protection wearer keeps virus droplets spreading infected. reduces viral load environment, show many studies. doesnt avoid infections decreasing viral load means gives higher probability reach infection dose around. Plus big burden people. sitting doctors office waiting room right FFP2 cant say effects much eventhough asthma. problem wearing masks?  caught % bit much. trials started last year scientists would happily taken 60% efficacy rate. fact worked well beyond expectations big bonus.  Minnesota 100% correct, happens host end transmission period (10 days COVID) irrelevant. There's pressure become less deadly. perhaps get bad dose? seemed QA issue single batch Moderna vaccine partially recalled partially not. mean, might seem like funny haha drama American, UK desperately waiting grandma immunosuppressed little brother vaccinated, experiencing fears Germany France. That's mean. bit insensitive act like entertaining game we're afraid loved ones' lives. Celebrating Israeli scientific accomplishments like celebrating scientific “research” done Nazis Japan decades ago.  agree you. sucks us pandemic, teachers essential employees others. kids falling behind struggle moving forward. like war, really. However, war front lines soldiers. essential employees front lines asked stand ground hold line. essential employees seeing teachers. know busting backsides (most) working extra hours try teach online. classroom would element. 

I conversation reddit teacher main concern fear classroom. fear real tough. job puts contact people day location could easily catch spread. still go everyday though. 

In end see teachers getting vaccine back classroom. Hopefully get thing past us move forward again. - Flu season virtually exterminated due consisted mask wearing
- Covid-19 spreading enough mask wearing

Pick one. one. Bleach effective UK variant, shows vitro study. crazy me. know 3 people it, 2 last Feb knew thing. LIVE?! Leftist leader Mexico vs right-wing nutjob Brazil. Hell India right-wing authoritarian-ish leader right gotten lot shit covid handling Mexico global press. Yeah. I’m at-risk individual, I’m okay waiting little longer means streamline system get shots arms ASAP. Australia much east maps usually see.  Australian vaccination programme starts next month. We’ve ordered enough vaccinations every single Australian (50 million doses, 25 million people). mandatory vaccination children Australia, vaccines general vaccination schedule (like one be) free. also excellent, well-coordinated public healthcare system outstanding contact tracing.

I genuinely believe Australia New Zealand first countries able open borders continue completely normal life (like we’ve enjoying domestically, small exceptions, almost half year) heard immunity. test positive need tested though? far know Israel testing asymptomatic people tells us get sick. nutshell. read Trump even listen war hardened generals discussing military strategy. people listened hosts TV morning news program ""Fox Friends"". tie back Covid 19 relevant discussion, Trump f'ing listen war generals, asuredly listen advice Dr. Fauci giving bad Covid 19 pandemic really properly limit spread flatten curb .04% people would otherwise caught (confirmed contraction virus)? .04% people vaccinated? two different things. 90% recipients going get disease anyway, number mean much. Excellent point, sympathies. Preventing people going walk outside helps save exactly zero life. getting slightly angry now. OK restrictions *when help*. comes showing safe multiple times, time skeptics fade. I'm Europe rollout really slow too. least started vaccinating elderly.

But please, stop spreading misinformation. Astrazeneca vaccine ""crappy"" all. people hesitate getting shots. According available sources, AstraZeneca 100% effective severe cases. Yes, might still get Covid getting vaccinated (just like Pfizer). certainly die even go hospital. matters. Also, absolutely concerns safety vaccine.

And might great idea give effective vaccines 65+ aged groups less effective vaccines younger people. Looks like way guarantee spread instead stopping :(

What aim! ignorant enough go herd immunity via infection cuz proven around world us give lots variants nasty  That, also live thread children going school. (And one far future dire consequences grannies dying). Why? 

NFL seem control attendance spreading games. 

Theres way control SB parties, main focus article. 

So unless delay 3-4 months, make difference all. global pandemic, Scandinavian pandemic.

Compare countries rest world.

Being #21 190+ countries good. Top 5 countries deaths per million countries ""did everything right"" yet performed worse Sweden. tell you?

Following gatekeeping train thought, New Zealand Australia horribly compared neighbors Pacific Islands, no? 

Again: GLOBAL pandemic. one tested vs Brazil variants yet. Common sense one thing can't buy lol He's literally quoted relevant sections. affects every Middle Eastern country Pfizer order - live, there's already one delay due production issues. would exacerbate it. EU gross incompetence. Scandinavian pandemic, global pandemic. Please leave bias door. get himself? Perhaps view change. Well... commenting thread says exactly curfew work. yes, flatly deny works, sound basis reality. time: “it’s fine, it’s 3% mortality” somehow since lazy ass op couldnt bothered summary let me:

 

Irritated sweeping use executive orders COVID-19 crisis, state lawmakers around U.S. moving curb authority governors top health officials impose emergency restrictions mask rules business shutdowns.

The push underway states Arizona, Michigan, Ohio, Maryland, Kentucky, Indiana Pennsylvania, legislators seeking constitutional amendment strip governor many emergency powers.

Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Wayne Langerholc said amendment would “make unequivocally clear General Assembly co-equal branch ... monarchy voices matter.”

Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf counterparts around country argued need authority act quickly decisively fast-changing threat. 

The coronavirus killed estimated 430,000 Americans going lethal phase yet, despite rollout vaccines, new contagious variants abroad turning U.S. Haha, best answer read today. would definition systemic racism. Yes Sweden, like Denmark Norway Finland, sparsely populated dense Germany France UK.

A sparsely populated country got hit almost hard densely populated country nothing proud lmao. load shit. They'll access 50 million doses AstraZeneca, 50 million Novavax year, plus 10 million Pfizer next month. Thats population 25 million people. They're targeting 80% population vaccinated October. correct answer rush emergency approval, instead waited normal approval non-high-risk group contact tracing shelved, cannot help think obscuring tests confirmed cases scheme extent state emergency right next potential domestic tourism booms.   mean. get promised Soros bucks course will. Like good American demon possessed liberal drinks baby blood.  Policy requires 100% compliance lest completely fail bad policy. Keep dreaming. doubt conventions type happen year tech con another con August cancel last weeks Got I’m idiot;( still question asked why’d put half dose every hundred wouldn’t make sense 1/200?  Hey, bring math this! got first dose Wednesday! wasn’t expecting get early wasn’t frontline healthcare worker I’m 65, scope job changed made necessary. 

I’m telling family WAY lax whole time know I’ll pressured visits play loose wild mask-wearing. behaviors aren’t changing, I’m staying inside much possible even immunity kicks in. I’m writing comment I’m super stoked gotten all!  Anywhere 61-71% pop polling said get vaccinated waiting see goes decide get vaccinated It’s .5 per 100 .5/100 1 per 200. Another way think .5 per 100 = (2)(.5) per (100)(2) = 1 per 200. I'll add 50/50, real toss up, either happens doesn't. Wow, got lucky. could barely move arm got terrible fever chills night got shot.  Yeah. always kick public tantrum three months need to. need be. takes months variant become dominant strain, sometimes many months. 200k cases old variant, download firmware update become new variant. Finally right temperature them! know vaccine prevented 66% moderate severe cases?

By comparing control group. Nahh, would probably advantageous Covid either. Oooops, sorry ;-) first 3 months pandemic credit card spending like half less normal anything go anywhere, cooked everything home.

After 3 months like, fuck that. found places go, especially summer fall, found entertainment, got take-out bought entertainment stuff house. can't give everything fun life indefinitely. Yes, US AAP (American Academy Pediatrics) recommends influenza vaccination children 6 months older. 

Influenza actually quite dangerous children (more Covid, based data now). Young children particular high risk serious flu-related complications, hospitalization, etc. pediatric deaths, rare, occur largely children vaccinated. gonna seem like dumb question, connection Tyler Perry's Medea greek tragedy Medea Euripides? I've never seen movies, like kooky modern update like Brother Art Thou Odyssey? Anthony Fauci even expected first vaccine 50% effective.

Sure--everyone surprised Pfizer/Moderna effective were. However, given 95% effective others not, see reason wait get effective vaccine.

The caveat would gladly take J+J promised ability take Pfizer one later year (there lot reasons believe would work, many fewer believe would cause doin year now. think standing close people.   10% according study estimations. That’s I’m scared 😂 Sinovac \~50% trail Brazil, definitely worst result far. What’s thought need GOGGLES masks, vaccinated? think people saying they're thinking affect. would imagine WOULD big candidate US, especially later on, reason. ton rural communities struggling temp requirements vaccines. talking giving J&amp;J vaccine young healthy focus Pfizer Moderna risk populations.

However long term protection J&amp;J actually similar. 66% 72% people throwing around kind average efficacy different outcomes different periods. So...was Brexit good idea not? 🤷🏼‍♀️ think important part another contract signed first (which contract cannot override clause stating contracts that, cannot happen) UK specifically changed legally binding AZ supply certain number doses end given time frame. given signed 3 months prior unofficial agreement actually originally reached back last February... You’re right don’t EU right demand vaccines UK factories. part supply chain initial doses conflict. Unfortunately means EUs delivery schedule met. contracts matter EU trying claim contract says something doesn’t. don’t know you’re about.... every trial gets decide definition mild, moderate, severe disease. universal baseline that. CNN fucking outlets actually pretty level-headed last couple weeks. downer here, uneducated curious, know vaccine prevented 66% moderate severe cases? thought fear people Covid 19 unpredictable body could react it? 

From personal experience, last March ended hospital April affecting brain stem. I’m fit, healthy underlying conditions. months issues though. Husband kid didn’t get past November. Husband previous long-time smoker (quit 2018) fit overall healthy earache, stuffy nose tired week. Kid low fever less day, headaches tummy aches days. Completely different went through. 

How know 66% 44,000+ people actually going moderate severe cases begin with? mutations happen virus replicates.

the virus replicate host cells.

&amp;#x200B;

...so.. could ""infected"" hundreds mutations

just 99.999% never make out.

&amp;#x200B;

""throwing everything wall see sticks best""

&amp;#x200B;

**Why RNA virus mutation rates damn viruses high mutation rates—**up million times higher hosts**—and ***high rates correlated enhanced virulence evolvability***, traits considered beneficial viruses. However, mutation rates almost disastrously high, small increase mutation rate cause RNA viruses go locally extinct. Researchers often assume natural selection optimized mutation rate RNA viruses, new data shows that, poliovirus, selection faster replication stronger faster polymerases make mistakes. fabled mutation rates RNA viruses appear partially consequence selection another trait, high mutation rate optimal itself. NYT beat it: ""Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Vaccine Offers Strong Protection Fuels Concern Variants"" That's good. interesting see US trials see since it'll give us much clear picture. cannot trust doctors, cannot trust politicians, trust!? leaves protection variants.

Less protection. get less sick think people hoping somewhere around 80% efficacy.

I mean fuck I'll take matter initially little sad higher. believe largely significant demographic differences. E.g. far fewer Black Latino people essentially zero Native Americans, race/ethnic background sometimes factor vaccine drug efficacy. based promised numbers though. best effort provide that. way JJ numbera 0, put much written here.  ZERO idea talking about. EU merely trying blame someone delays would experiencing quicker sort out. Everyone delays, reason UK US flying got going earlier without worrying costs.  Teachers neeeeeeed vaccine forced wait . he's ""lawyer"" 50-60% eligible population probably take it, least short term. really something like 120 million people take it, we're already 27 million 23%. Yes EU decided fuck negotiate rather set bullet proof supply line within EU. mean point finger everyone, focused getting manufacturing rollout sorted. LOL. Stop, side splitting clever literacy trickery.

What? accuse mental gymnastics? AZ need go press say incorrect, tell EU. need conduct via press probably want due confidentiality agreement.

The EU saying AZ said something, AZ saying it. may think difference irrelevant real life \*who\* said \*does\* matter.

But whatever. keep telling maybe AZ said meant this, maybe EU actually meant said that. black white anyone read look. Nonsense! I’d take today! Well fever symptom fighting, sure. fever attacks virus, no.

EDIT: Michaels notes study participants prohibited take pain relievers either Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna COVID-19 trials efficacy rates still 95%. “While don’t exact numbers people research study … I’m sure number took acetaminophen ibuprofen 70% mild (side effects vaccine),” said. “And yet, still immunologic response.”

So basically said, it, matter. lol. Well....I mean it’s better nothing LETS GOOOOOOO Nope post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* People hoping traditional 1 shot vaccines would effective new tech 2 shot vaccines. Considering originally told us 80% Covid cases mild, find quite disappointing. Seasonal effects don’t make much sense, mean it’s still winter I've always fan starting efficiency moving towards equity later on. Early fairest thing vaccinate many people possible reduce spread much maybe possible view. aim harder reach audiences folks vulnerable easily reachable later sure that, given EU exports vaccines unlike ""winners"" USA, UK Israel. mask + gaiter working well far (it presses mask firmly, adds lots material) common long term issues reality. number news articles show common. mean 26m official cases US alone although considering atrocious testing back March/April last year likely cases much higher since would missed majority cases. mean we're still missing cases right many. consider unofficial cases we're probably looking atleast 50m cases US more. many cases people hispitlised actually suffer long term issues? far look like wll common.

Secondly people vaccinated better society protected general since less chance spresd around. depending many people get vaccinated etc still achieve herd [immunity experiments revealed prevent epidemic (reduce peak vaccine efficacy least 60% vaccination coverage 100% (reproduction number=2.5–3.5). vaccine efficacy threshold rises 70% coverage drops 75% 80% coverage drops 60% reproduction number 2.5, rising 80% coverage drops 75% reproduction number 3.5. extinguish ongoing epidemic, vaccine efficacy least 60% coverage 100% least 80% coverage drops 75% reduce peak 85%–86%, 61%–62%, 32% vaccination occurs 5%, 15%, 30% population, respectively, already exposed COVID-19 coronavirus. vaccine efficacy 60% 80% could still obviate need measures certain circumstances much higher, cases, potentially unachievable, vaccination coverages."" 

Now combine fact everyone going vaccinated J&amp;J. We'll vaccinated mixture pfizer/moderna 90%+ efficiency, Novavax 85% efficient others J&amp;J AZ 60-70% efficient. 70-80% coverage achievable since seems aim anyway still achieve herd immunity end pandemic. don’t ban place, still they’re delivering country far know.
The point that; even don’t need look don’t shape policies. Relevant: First all, say mild diseases could cause permanent damage? Please send article can. so, kind damage? wouldn’t say it’s mild disease that’s one article quickly googled up. one-off: well-documented doctors talking many J&amp;J game-changer 1) it’s one-shot 2) stored room temperature 3) mass-produced quicker Pfizer Moderna 4) keep hospital. Every year, hundreds thousands hospitalized flu, media doesn’t blink eye.

I understand this, agree big deal keep hospitals overrun. However, people elsewhere argued young people already [relatively low death (1 5,000 20-49 1 30,000 0-19) worried long-term effects even mild covid-19 infection.

I think many people making argument disingenuous simply trying scare people line, rather telling take precautions protect others, one them. desire lung heart damage even asymptomatic infection.

Given two vaccines exists 95% effective *and* U.S. enough vaccines everyone end summer, would rather wait. feeling many others feel way. going take second-rate vaccine better exists available soon.

The J+J big deal less wealthy countries sure--I doubt that. prevents hospitalizations, presumably long-haulers well.

How prevent long-haulers anyway, like percentage non-hospitalized patients? wondering. vaccines effective first Moderna vaccine shown efficacy approximately 92 per cent protecting COVID-19, starting 14 days first BBC article using data number infections, including days first dose yet started work, looked days 15-21. Using method, efficacy vaccine jumps 89%, diluted relatively high number infections vaccine begins seems single dose Pfizer/Moderna effective single dose Johnson. thank god contract disputes decided majorities twitter lol Better mess EC :-) study seems, ah, little odd. Almost like lipstick pig (well, maybe bad). seems like they've created broad category's show, ""hey, look, vaccine works use *this* deffinition.""

Pfizer Moderna's studies seemed lot cleaner. ""Vaccine 95% effective preventing desease.""

Whats efficacy vaccine minor illness? 85% effective preventing severe cases, 60% preventing moderate illness, guess pretty low preventing minor illness, makes question ability curtail spread covid. Also, lot long haulers, understand it, minor initial illness. 

So may keep people hospital now, keep people safe longterm preventing long covid?

Disclosure: know little vaccines... dont take points/questions ""to bank."" Admittedly need read study get chance. someone say variants can’t expect thanksgiving Christmas next year. can’t anymore. professor, interviewed Irish newspaper, seems think so. want read whole thing, search ""Kingston Mills"" (the

I read all, lawyer, volunteered. lawyer?

This guy heads up- dont know 57% figure represents preventing symptoms preventing death. entirely possible 57% infected SA variant symptom free. effectiveness severe illness may much higher. wasn’t expecting see J&amp;J news morning, I’d take shot tomorrow calm storm, perhaps. COVID mutates infects apes learn talk bare weapons take world... think movie effect. Watching Haikyuu makes sad havent able play indoor volleyball since last march. vaccines, usually OK give booster dose months later road. starting moderately effective single dose now, potentially following second reinforcement dose needed definitely right call. Come on, dude... completely ignoring context. France got hit hard early on, like Italy, New York City, etc. Since rough time couple months Fall overall handling relatively well compared US. US whole keeps getting worse worse people even care anymore. US complete failure. Disagree. Time essence here. Give j j lower risk groups fast greatly slow pandemic.

You don’t need everyone get greatly slow things. Pfizer moderna reformulations done given time new variants things control.

Also, nobody said Pfizer effective future. know. 'local' friends (still hour away) still extra cautious. Like even want go walk outside ""cases high"". 

I'd love make new friends. moved new area fiance crazy commute before, finally time stuff here. fuck even make friends? There's fairs, concerts, bars, meetups...even outdoor dining opened here. even downloaded bumble BFF back fall, went nowhere one wanted meet up.

I'm tired society revolving around one thing. doubtful could couple months, almost year later. I'm tired. tired. purpose is:

**Manufacturing sites**  wife too. Mine mild. Almost cold-like week, loss smell, light pressure chest. wife low grade constant fevers days, really bad body aches, tiredness. worst life. O2 always good still make plans go hospital. scary. 

I'd like vaccine prevents that. know seen much behavior changing. Things re-opening lot people still ignoring restrictions place. think drop cases increasing levels immunity population seasonal effects. vaccine efficacy shot roof, also blood. Dead people 100% resistant covid 19, big brain much? I'm wearing N95, I'm wearing respirators, I'm double-masking.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Going late given UK already factory set up.....

The EU also one obviously. can, fact, make serious negotiations despite sub seemingly assuming otherwise. Please set subreddit this. antivaxxer movement driven overweighting anecdotes poor responses vaccines discounting risk disease. people learn screw up. Failures best teachers. uk ban export 174 drugs needed uk patients still smell much probably wearing enough masks Nice! We're expecting tonne Pfizer March. buddy military says thats they're planning vaccinate troops  believe Canada secured vaccines contracts EU countries funded projects like US UK get first dibs. live, one allowed interact anyone another household. Inside outside. 

Our doors nailed shut, honestly feels way. sure country in, US insurance, may nurse line contact may able help you. know what? agree her. Restrictions freaking Australia comparatively tighter UK New Years Christmas double digit cases. easing restrictions Christmas New Years here. watched horror (as many times throughout pandemic) decision ease restrictions UK. Nowhere comment even come close implying that

Yes, did. claimed individuals represent small proportion cases.

Even 1 1,000 would unimaginably dangerous get particular reason suspect vaccine protect them...

What? say anything might understood such. literal point vaccine prevent getting disabled.

We must re-open everything way people dying anymore point. we'd get *millions* new infections per day. instantly. Plus even though may get horribly sick still possible for.you spreading it. current vaccination rate 2 years cna get vaccine US. since safe screw still.waiting for.you time.tk.party. /s Easier said done Yep. That's 3-round burst common lots assault rifles instead full-auto. There's many situations beneficial full-auto small arms. took virus seriously still wear mask. But, point, think people like need get media exposure.  ""In original antigenic sin prior exposure antigen leads ineffective response related antigen.""

I realize I'm knowledgeable field. That's interesting. Thanks sharing. J&amp;J approved, required average plummet. grandparents deceased I'm good health, physically active etc. odds ending ICU bed low. folks likely refuse vaccination significant overlap folks likely it!

Personally going wait till I'm vaccinated ""return normal"" want mess lungs, even though I'm high risk. 25.6 million covid! means we're vaccinated infected!

Seeing vaccine killed less 400k ppl seems like preferable option. mean, isn’t true:

“""Canada back line,"" Noubar Afeyan, co-founder chairman Moderna, told CBC's chief political correspondent Rosemary Barton Sunday.

Afeyan said Canada among first countries make pre-order Moderna, country guaranteed receive certain portion company's initial batch doses long vaccine proves safe effective given regulatory approval.” Gotcha, thanks wish people understood this.

In Australia minor furor AZ reported efficacy 62% (with two full doses), multiple ""pundits"" calling used efforts focused mRNA vaccines. missed AZ effective 100% efficacy developing serious infection!

I'd rather take vaccine sooner prevent serious illness, hospitalization death risk minor ""flu-like"" infection, wait another six nine months mRNA vaccine. Besides, get mRNA protein vaccines later global rush subsided. Let guess..under advocating give vaccine 80% (under 65) first then?

Of course not, public understand nobody dies! we'll millions permanently disabled people 10/20 years, people die anymore even small part public following rules stop that. that's point, people choose cautious people threw caution wind. Regardless results two different approaches belies incompatibility people get mine sooner rather later. Masks planes good idea anyways. Fauci, I’m vaccinated I’m going ever tf want Purple monkey dishwasher No, that's obviously I'm saying. Nowhere comment even come close implying that, ask please misrepresent I'm saying. individuals represent small proportion cases.

And particular reason suspect vaccine protect them... I've going traveling since restrictions partially lifted May. wear mask mandated. I'm gonna mandated. Actually 60% don’t include people HIV+.

They present challenge immune systems capable. That’s problem science needs tackle, don’t think effects timeline normalcy. totally agree. Keep good work then! count doses directly state datasources officially approved CDC yet. CDC considered absolute conservative number. feel headache pain arm?

As far know, second time around non contagious flu. waiting vaccinated, staff talking miss work couple days second dose. Who's Phil hogging many vaccines? make cells print protein out. literally learned mRNA high school bio. injects mRNA makes cell print spike protein body kills off, hence minor flu symptoms people get day two. Even +65s getting it. population around carrying less less risk infected. way, it'll stay ~~Wuhan~~ South Africa. It’s also really hard test transmission ethically, since you’d intentionally try infect people COVID experiment occur.

Huh? one test subjects Covid define ""This amount virus found"" ""can transmit"". Actually also clue, phase 3 subjects get titres measured every week well covid bunch oversimplified “you still transmit it” scaremongering.

Yeah, scientist gave true answer ""We positive proof transmission impossible vaccinated persons"" instead answer normal people would understand. No.

The metric hospitalizations reason think people hospitalized frequency getting vaccinated... Variant not.

We vaccine 60% effective presumably protection hospitalizations AZ also around 60% I’m normal times, say hospitalizations vaccinated people.

This could change there’s reason think delay normalcy IMO.  care travel even right now. eating restaurants. Drinking bar. Going concert. I'm yearning less anxiety right now. Like worrying stopping gallon milk. playing board games elderly sister. visiting sick friend. Bloomberg 27.3 million now. That's 1.7 mil since yesterday. Spectacular news! Say things like alone friend. long schools stay closed

That's problem, though. unconscionable keep school virtual long. We're failing whole generation low income kids. Bloomberg’s daily numbers always slightly higher? us 27.3 million country didnt even start yet Still amazes someone obviously contemptible unqualified end president Brazil. mean heard elders getting Covid getting COVIF vaccine? Lol Yup, US track rapidly increase numbers. Hopefully, beginning end. like Miley Cyrus song, ""It's Party USA""!!!!!! yep, those'll American trial remember 60% actually bad. data severe cases? vaccine still prevents cases South-African variant, ok. people got difficulties breathing year later real? end goalposts moving? 

What reference to? Please specific include links possible. can’t understand point vaccine even get doses discouraged anything normal still? That's game conventions. Tons people ever see things. probably try attend 2022 rate things going. There's caveats efficacy SA variant.

* confidence interval huge, something like 10% 90%. really enough data say much. 
* 50% figure includes patients AIDS. include patients estimate 60% (but still large confidence interval). EU start trade war like, naive enough think no-one fight back. pre print server article process peer review suggests relative lack cleanliness India actually helps boost immunity. Assuming 80% adults choose get vaccinated, need deliver 415M doses, 388M doses. 1.26M day, that's 308 days hit numbers. Hopefully things speed soon.

I assume people aged 50+ people get vaccine want it, numbers plummet things less back normal. living like fucking prisoner. one damn municipality US that’s requiring people 100% stay home interact anyone. It’s 100% « how many people you’re willing piss live life ». It’s potentially killing anyone come contact can’t wait months.

People get covid don’t get mad you. die.

I hope sits right conscience mental health you’re going « live life » it. Oh gotcha. Spreaders. 
I focused carriers viral load capacity. Obviously I’ve disappointed people looking downvotes rewarded with... 
:)  mRNA causes protein made. Immune system works *exactly same* times.

Yes, apparently nobody tested transmission prevented. likely ridiculous assume might. problem? Contract fulfilled, bit later.

If later, Tell me, please, least one reason EU export vaccine?

Tell shouldn't. protectionist, trade blockade retaliation private corporation failure. Johnson admit one MPs lied rather threaten Sturgeon? Seems like best way defuse situation. Right would go hang friend's houses meet eat inside restaurants maskless friends? wear N95 face shield work grocery store. friends mask hang out. Sorry Fauci I've traveling since May. know it’s good news original/UK strains, that’s really bad SA strain right? 

I understand make boosters fall need to, wouldn’t prolong chance returning normal? It’s also important keeps people hospital, doesn’t seem like we’re going let spread unabated even that. 

I can’t help feel pessimistic results reason. that, importantly delaying inevitable surge, California death per capita still better ny state. 

Hard compare nyc la city la County Yeah, really necessary explain fucked usa really is. use white male silhouette? Female Asian silhouette? used? Keep calm? reports going stop export Pfizer vaccine. seem calm me, win Pfizer.  clarify, doses administered *per* 100 people, means comparatively little two-dose vaccine regimen.

The graph meant post one, shows 32% Israel received least one dose vaccine: like one reasons rules post trackers subreddit) Dude, would prove got vaccinated anyone meet? 

If allow vaccinated people wear mask public Karens claim got shot. Obviously can't that, right. realize I’m aware that? It’s mitigation reduction, nothing 100% effective preventing Covid-19. think could spread worldwide issue? fucking joke thats got hit hardest early on. dont think song would sung many people hadnt already infected  keep saying ""more beginning think like you"" when, experience, beginning think like me, see people area. See? it, too.

If mask, give free one Walmart stores. I've never needed ask one I've always one, understand financial problem hits many across country. know sure, imagine places give masks away free really need one. Usually, they're dollar, like assume position in, that's suggested give one free Walmart.

They're also saying need wear 2 KN47 masks. two masks, haha.

The cautious approach Covid worked? Uh, yeah, never that. always bunch people wearing masks social distancing cancelled people still actually trying.

And... is. cannot rip 100% population without ending millions deaths large number people sort damage may may permanent recovering virus. vaccines coming. We're really home stretch. need keep cases manageable vaccine's widely available enough, get right back before. Yeah probably means nothing unless loved one rate infection people got shot compared people didn't, enrolled trial.

Take information released Novavax study enrolled 15,000 participants 18-84 years age, including 27% age 65. primary endpoint UK Phase 3 clinical trial based first occurrence PCR-confirmed symptomatic (mild, moderate severe) COVID-19 onset least 7 days second study vaccination serologically negative (to SARS-CoV-2) adult participants baseline.  first interim analysis based 62 cases, 56 cases COVID-19 observed placebo group versus 6 cases observed NVX-CoV2373 group, resulting point estimate vaccine efficacy 89.3% (95% CI: 75.2 – 95.4). 62 cases, 61 mild moderate, 1 severe (in placebo 

So, 62 people trial caught COVID. 62, 56 placebo recipients. Simple maths-- 90% effective. Obesity huge risk factor, US miles ahead Europe weight, good way likely given card information taken staff schedule second dose appointment. hard. pregnant woman high risk infection. old news. new news.

Women's bodies lower resistance body slough off, attack growing baby first 2 trimesters. Even 3rd trimester continue low resistance body reads external presence.

So, COVID 19 shows woman pregnant, higher normal probability becoming infected.

But, immune system robust, virus hit cells young abundance.

What ignored South African variant. apparently causes severe impacts infected. I'm without details understand logic. may mean advice get pregnant virus control. Trash kids get pregnant better living South Carolina Christian controlled states. forbid abortion. effectively killing females states. Stunning. [covid vaccine good thing apparently new mRNA vaccines altered new strains fairly quickly.

I'm ready 3rd, 4th even 5th booster shot necessary! wife teaching in-person since September. shut times cases. stressful honestly think kids learning much parents get babysitter that's seems matter. real information article, headline quote doctor pretty much says all. Tl:dr

Johnson says may seeing real-time, state federal medical officials saying since vaccines became available. Israel GDP per capita:$43K

You’re snorting ... 4-5 times day?? what? letter make request. sounds like there’s fundamental difference perspective means end pandemic. Sure, probably could technically pandemic end summer never worn mask social distanced, regard dragged pandemic longer. reason fact slow infection. Without measures, everybody could gotten infected gotten with, opinion losses would cost would unacceptable. bad enough measures take. mental health may pits, it’s first time I’ve dealt life altering event lasted year. surreal realized entire world understands feeling wishing could turn back clock, feeling like shouldn’t situation, slowly realizing life now.

There’s gotta gimme getting vaccinated. little quid pro quo entice people get done. exception betteridge's law    Literally every single country gone route insanely better outcomes us. good point. something people seem understand. can't look one group without comparing different, non-vaccinated group. otherwise correct may people actually exposed virus. Yes Qaren needs go spin class fuck take care kid. Also think poors?

Drives wall...

Also wait anti vax teachers start infecting kids. fun too. hope many them. I'm upset nonsense nowadays that's fine mainstream...  counted sufficient. sarcasm noted. doctors sign that? agree. Yes, jobs save lives, said anything pandemic without enough PPE? think doctors feel like that's job signed became doctor first world country.

I would also agree teachers offered PPE want in-person learning. know districts offered whether unions accepted turned down. son’s district announced they’re going person (for first time year) starting first day teachers eligible vaccine. wait couple weeks get vaccines first?!? control/nearly eliminated there's need rush. vaccines went normal approval process rather getting emergency approval like places. 

The Pfizer vaccine approved last week that's start. We've stockpiling AstraZenica vaccine production Australia since November start soonish. CNN needs fire CNN. single layer cotton mask barely make difference. Would need least four layers cotton. May well triple n95 sure.  Ontario, Quebec, New York time, areas LA, Sacramento, Alberta, Tennessee November, parts Texas including El Paso...

Need go on? think Canada fine? Novavax horizon, non-UK/EU/US production, they'll enough doses cover entire population. Otherwise either Moderna Pfizer coming enough well. Give break! allowed 425000 people &amp; counting die pandemic taken seriously &amp; someone wants pretend we’ll 1st “crush it”? Fools. accelerated lot. CA made huge strides daily vaccines administered, twice rate state. Two million doses ten day supply current rate. Wearing piece cloth face = self immolation. can't imagine happy date negotiated, met.

Negotiated who? unions seemingly left out. Depends define ""western"" ""crushing"". I'd say NZ AUS basically crushed it, though need occasional targeted local lockdowns keep way.

Through vaccination alone, would depend whether Israel considered western not. not, US probably first western nation thinking back late spring so: societies people got used wearing masks &amp; keeping distance continuing live way long virus longer factor people's lives. many us habit put mask time walk door like might w/ headphones, jacket, etc? Imagine hypothetical 2025 60 Minutes segment 'The people never stopped living pandemic life'. generally, people may bit paranoid around strangers meeting new people casually even pandemic over. expect pandemic causing psychological damage &amp; changes starting realise. Generation Z's big life formation event looks far pandemic, nearly school university disruptive time points life shape (childhood/teens/early 20s). Us Millennials 9/11. positives come pandemic culture emphasise saving money rainy day. bet people think twice always keeping weeks' supply food &amp; water house even areas regularly get big storms. general prepping considered responsible behaviour. Maybe less people go debt &amp; instead buy truly afford pay cash for. expect work home stay want it. mild flu-like symptoms days first one second obliterated me. body aches , chills subjective fever. lasted night next day felt hung functional. regrets Washington Post run [a recommending one wear two masks upgrade better mask. Smoked twenty-five years breathing difficult. make right thing do.   will, sure. plant seeds. Hold onto free time- don’t let employer try dominate time encourage coworkers same. people see others willing resist, they’ll likely bc there’s safety numbers. First off, would half country laughing this? New variants equal new measures needed get control vaccine widely available enough cases manageable enough. seems fine masks hassle whatsoever.

I'd say adding fuel fire either subliminally directly suggesting people forego basic health measures move getting ""back normal"". I'm talking comment here, necessarily, I'm talking comments.

I've off, more-so recently, I've noticing certain people try suggest ""the people decide get back normal."" follow subreddits dedicated questioning lockdowns fan Scott Atlas Ron DeSantis. incredibly clear type person type person consistently either spoken defied basic health measures pandemic that's partly we're way now.

Simply put, trying gain sort following subreddit change people's minds approach pandemic would dangerous months ago, likely then, even more-so right we're close need screw society handful months. agree symptom bad parenting shifting responsibility onto teachers. talking treating symptom done losing battle. putting anybody risk will.

Hahahahaha almost like believe [Pfizer vaccine slightly less effective key parts South African variant, study good. And, even without vaccine, cases mild anyways. 0.04% transmission, law large numbers longer comes play argument 2% (or whatever number thrown around now) die legitimately valid. ""investing provides opportunity make money"" sound like ""you invest everything penny stocks"" you? think would work hand-in-hand people negotiations understand done? can't imagine happy date negotiated, met.

They slotted early possible, planned +4 weeks return, reasonable imho based upon science, that's WFH medical profeasionals got forcing return non-essential services.

So, teachers wanted something normal, maybe gotten ahead made known rather reactionary? trials expose participants virus see catches it? real thing. America uses schools day care education system. kind fucked. pandemic simply pushed responsibility parents turns America overall really terrible parenting disciplining kids. asthma kind lung conditions? Worldometer 2 days ago (yesterday) 159k yesterday (today) 162k.

What fuck gives? 25 got moderna insane immune response! armpit lymph nodes side body got shot swollen like 48 hours could barely move arm without pain. Plus fever fatigue headache understand it, wrong usually consequence every time virus replicated tiny property changed frontline workers vaccinated now, priority N95 masks go general public? delivery schedule EU agreed ""estimated"", whole thing ""best efforts"". neither Palestinian territories.  Distancing always effective masking. Nordic countries advantage pandemic, since culture infrastructure compatible distancing. Nordic countries basically pushed distancing extreme dare trying find best helps people cope it. Sweden went mostly normal distancing, minor restrictions. pandemic wearing everyone, nordics also starting slip, slip back natural distancing, masks, feels close. point AZ fucked sold doses able produce Palestinians government... occupied territories? 5.1 refers within EU, explicitly excludes UK.  EU behind UK, kind bureaucracy would make want leave EU. obligation supply doses manufactured EU. obligation supply doses UK. simple that. No. Private company must follow law. Ban law.

And butcher shop, first come, first serve. According contract AZ must use UK diabetics fulfill contract EU.But AZ opposite, use EU fabrics fulfill contract UK. 

Export ban fair reliable solution. UK may get UK. EU may get EU. _SHUT ORDER VACCINES HOLY SHIT_ Ya, I’m going dig again. Feel free make claims backed data. remember done back big city combining samples save resources. Based expected positivity rate there's optimal number samples combine per test, there's positive group go back retest everyone it. smaller number people expect positive people test once. UK probably finish USA, think USA close second. western countries good job vaccines far.

Now sure aus nz doing, Eu really badly. seem information now. contract says ""best reasonable efforts"". EU reason understand guarantee.

There also ""estimated delivery scheduled"" largely redacted oddly enough. However, note ""estimated"". never see half people again, many ones might see could already much changed.

Life though. Saying 
“תן לי חיסון”
Might work better 😂 way (we're told) UK contract clearly states UK based manufacturing reserved UK. compromise need found. [If cocked Meanwhile, EU Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders warned ""vaccine Speaking Belgian radio, said: ""The EU commission pushed co-ordinate vaccines contracts behalf 27 precisely avoid vaccines war EU countries, maybe UK wants start vaccine ""Solidarity important principle EU. Brexit, clear UK want show solidarity anyone.""

These comments hilarious. like angry little man getting someone's face shoving accusing trying start trouble. 

If want proof see calm British government's comments been. Michael Gove even hinted might share EU. EU contract got UK contract??? Exactly point! names swapped. fine print seen doubt solved...

However, EU clearly egg face here, instead saying moved quicker lashing out... good look.

This always going part USA gets right. good proactive, we're great mass production logistics compared first world countries. telling truth.

Here coffe shops, restaurants, supermarkets, buses Correct clause 5.1. UK facilities used supply EU. think long kids allowed, adults required vaccinated entering, think it'll fine restrictions otherwise. ACEN 2021 still cancelled May, think possible summer normalcy again. definitely think late year cons on, like AWA. 5.1 states ""shall use best efforts produce within EU"" - exclude facilities outside EU AZ able produce whole amount doses within EU Yeah, countries Europe are. People obsessed Sweden. Austria similar level population-weighted density, similar amount deaths, happens next Norway Finland, they're bad Sweden apparently. Speak clean phone daily return home work measure deaths differently. Look up. shall use Best Reasonable Efforts manufacture vaccine manufacturing sites located within EU (which, **for purpose section 5.4 only** shall include United Kingdom).

The bit section 5.4 includes UK sites specifically states refers section 5.4. Highlights mine. 60 SA, 49 patient AIDS read Sweden fucked up. like expected. Omg 3x bad   Oh yh Israel vaccinate entire population long UK/US. They've done really well we're western nations here. really consider western country middle eastern country. That's said UK US understand need don’t disagree, there’s never vaccine anything that’s 100% effective. vaccine prevents serious infection, people aren’t completely immune conferred immunity mixed vaccine induced response organic immune response. point we’ll decide perfect can’t enemy good since former clearly unattainable.  info soon? point say use UK's sites, matters EU trying claim doses. ""Reasonable best efforts"" sound like compelled break another contract.  Argentina considered western then? Wow they're fucking terrible compared Norway. Yikes.  don’t think I’ve spread misinformation

You literally claimed presented multiple sources actually linked one.

Said source directly contradicted you.

Literally everything say self-serving lie point. pretend rude point obvious lies busy clinging delusion spreading misinformation. EU paid build. next 2-3 weeks rise pretty significantly. may slow first doses supply start becoming tight Pfizer Moderna hope hit Q1 target ramping even more. produced ""within EU"".

it say ""will be"" - says AZ ""shall use best efforts produce within EU"" Yep, problem: source data measured trust graphs, find comprehensive set data policies ones. I’m telling data shows.

lol yes, sure **telling me**, reason dont want **show me.** Concerning current status EU happy anything summer. even dispute r/coronavirus instead legal fight two incompetent institutions? Yeah makes absolutely sense. Mexico much less populous much smaller cities much less density India makes absolutely sense Mexico deaths. Sure, likely deaths per capita India pretty nasty spike cases many people living close together big city logically track Mexico would deaths India Palestinians government(s), supposed take care them, Israel.

As blockaiding, Gaza constant state war Israel, yes bloackaid them, like Syria let Israelis enter Syria let gazans enter Israel.

Yes withhold Palestinian taxes, two cases, 1-when fail pay electricity Israel provides, 2- shoot rockets us.

We force trade go Israel, option go egypt, guess what? Egypt let anyone Gaza, yet hear shit news, yes Arab Muslim ""brothers"" acting even worse Israel constantly try kill. 0.04% week. 1/ We're even using AZ vaccine right period. approved yet.

2/ realise young people extremely vulnerable COVID 19 right? (people heart problems, pregnant women, diabetic folks, etc etc).

3/ I'm totally kind game Commission playing right now. let's fool thinking British Gov would far altruistic EU one. Every one trying best protect right now.

Von Der Leyen team spectacularly shat bed, idea Brits would prioritise elder EU youth would ludicrous too. 5.1 clearly not. question interpretation, that's contract says.  doesn’t matter all. even 30% world population going vacinated year. virus everywhere, new variants emerge time. Nah, EU killed people ordering 3 months late. Sweden awful compared Scandinavian counterparts. one worst performers world something proud of... described Iowa. misunderstand. need infections vaccinated groups Vs non vaccinated groups able draw conclusions that. constant messaging shifts blame away administrative parties responsible....to you, me, every individual. shamed blamed rioting way syringe holder get vaccinated economy! There’s huge moral difference fighting vaccines people (which basically politicians job), actively making sure one else even manufacture vaccine. None us looking good, holding back vaccine ingredients limit number vaccines produced global scale, helps nobody, quite opposite. would say first country vaccinate population going crush covid likely Israel. Australia NZ done great job containing it, still vulnerable vaccinated. Section 5.1 though key point manufacture initial doses. 5.4 allows UK used manufacturing 5.4 only.  Parson ignorance, understand post all. Well should’ve produced vaccines then. can’t start demanding things, every country massive public health crisis. Russia trying help, attitude awful. percentage people didnt vaccine got infected time span? Went good good least. Palestinian Authority separate healthcare system Israeli system. Israel currently vaccinating individuals Israeli system work Israeli hospitals (1000 non Israelis vaccinated way). Palestinian residents East Jerusalem Israeli Arabs equal access vaccine although hesitancy take vaccine. Yeah case it’s bad. However would completely ignore fact UK got less 20% first delivery live it. EU expecting UK take hit (due delays) isn’t reverse true UKs shortfall. 

If needs equitable distribution make EUs failings shouldn’t apply Q1 delivery schedules full capacity achieved. includes UKs first delivery far smaller equivalent EU one got better! interpretation, wrote 5.4 clearly includes UK facilities Putting visibility many people referencing wrong section:

Clause 5.4 refer AZ using best reasonable efforts establish manufacturing facilities EU UK. However, Clause 5.1 (which relevant provision regarding actual delivery vaccine doses), refers doses manufactured within EU (and UK). basically commitment AZ deliver doses outside EU I’m trying win argument, I’m telling data shows. year Americans still fighting masks.. reinfection rate covid still low. Robust immunity shown follow studies least 8 months later well 90% people EU fucked ordering 300m failed French vaccine. Neither you.

But people generally getting tired shit sick told can't live normal life ""experts"" people like completely satisfied ought allowed to. come daily articles Belgium's botched COVID response? 

Tegnell Giesecke (not official clearly authority figure) told media outlet would ""the rest world gone crazy"", ""other countries killing fly hammer"" ""Stockholm reach herd immunity May/June/July"".

I remember Belgian officials anything similar. pretend rude hide fact lying whole time"".

Just look conversations, don’t think many would disagree.

Hardly, don’t think I’ve spread misinformation. clearly wrong use terminology. 

Look, I’ve said piece. Clearly don’t really care, that’s fine.  easy get N95s know look. KN95s KF94s even easier cheaper. There's little reason using one three, especially since KN95s KF94s like less dollar per mask now. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Clause 5.4 refer AZ using best reasonable efforts establish manufacturing facilities EU UK. However, Clause 5.1 (which relevant provision regarding actual delivery vaccine doses), refers doses manufactured within EU (and UK). basically commitment AZ deliver doses outside EU That's definitely true. 96% original strain, 90% UK strain 50% SA strain. chance... far many cases waaay many vaccine-dodgers make misleading title. mean EU blocking exports vaccines U.K. (hardest hit country Europe) also means people would die. U.K. already done world massive favour Oxford insist vaccine sold COST PRICE vaccine funded fir majority U.K. govt. 

The EU’s behaviour utterly unacceptable. U.K. shouldn’t block active ingredients vaccine it’s unlikely ever would it’s show EU really shouldn’t go “tough man” road. Even they’re hospitalized necessarily mean super sick could mean don’t somebody take care they’re hospitalized ensure gets serious receive treatment. something Ministry health published yesterday Telegram (In Hebrew) says 305 individuals hospitalized good condition. Presumably 16 good condition. There's nothing wrong giving people idea over. negative consequence handful people online criticizing. gonna roll zero protection awaiting rollout better protection? could get now, probably end pandemic mRNA vaccine future. Cause LA epicenter CA likely give F- watch game others. bay area counties new cases dropped heavily new cases since holidays finally ended, la still high. think theyre warning la get another holiday event. workplace basic things protect you. no-brainer. 

And anyone says ""what grocery workers"" ... Yeah, duh, get vaccinated ASAP too. Health care workers seniors first, frontline people choice interact public. JJ barely 50% South African variant. That’s Gap. That’s Dollar Tree. 😂

Pfizer/Moderna bust. ~1.4 billion, that's still lot. vaccine war EU lose. lose EU lose more. UK producing adjuvant GSK vaccine producing Valneva Novavax well AZ.

If everyone keeps vaccines UK still fine later planned. Probably 2021 would’ve repeat 2020, CA shut down, Texas/Florida/Georgia giving crap ignoring situation entirely, every state half open try salvage much economy possible. didn’t even consider this. sounds like big disadvantage adenovirus vector vaccines general. viruses cause long term symptoms. Including influenza. call ""long flu"". thing understand countries(like Canada) invest mRNA vaccines. 

The EU declined 500M Pfizer order, care Moderna seems trying get AstraZeneca cancel order. vaccine supposed save us.

GG. Trash EU. Wow, terrible take. Zaire gdp per capita $600 US, China $12,000. resource differential massive turn, China able create effective vaccine candidate considering kept disease wraps months. going defend country allowed spread across world unmitigated, least effective points. Costco sells kn95 bulk 100 100, weeks ago sale price 75 100. also sell medical grade masks 100 300 they're, according reviews, small hard shell masks, already learned lesson using moldex' n95 face like masks.

Hit hard fast. Exactly! really important. vaccines use participant data contracted covid within 30 days vaccine? Soooo....everybody get vaccinated. Thank you. group small judge last number. info long covid. Mild infections known also cause it. cares transmission severe cases, hospitalizations, deaths aren’t issue. talk long term covid day long, minuscule thing worry about. can’t stop society it.

Pfizer/Moderna - Tom Brady

J&amp;J - Drew Brees It’s defined trial details here: people oxygen levels dipped 93% still didn’t go hospital. would qualify severe hospitalized. Considering drop 90% 60% Novavax, 72% 57% bad.

They testing two doses well booster must work degree. wonder results pretty much would get single dose vaccines. EU care Novavax trying hard piss Oxford.

Looks like we'll die Pfizer ramps production. worry virus exposure though eyes. Hmmm interesting US also testing arguments contract EU. one weakest.

Being first would matter stated contract. Eventually enough people would get infected herd immunity achieved. many pandemics end eventually. imply would better get single dose mRNA single dose J&amp;J? lmao makes logical sense.

Zaire first information ebola, created vaccine. Likely, article Johnson &amp; Johnson also researching whether adding second dose would boost efficacy. results yet available.

So, yet quite known. really matter though it? can't new strain every year get back normal without everyone getting wrecked. Good! stop exportation! issue?

How hell someone irresponsible get elected?  show data proves prevent long haul symptoms millions mild infections low efficacy vaccine drive. 

Alternative: make excellent vaccines everyone. 

Maybe crummy ones stop gap fr 2021, shouldn’t go vaccine can’t stop cardiovascular neurological problems mild infections causing. wrong thinking naive think UK variant already spreading US cities, especially ones airports direct flights Heathrow never shut flights?

In lot WA Coronavirus Seattle subs, lot people dooming UK variant since Seattle media reported two suburban Seattle counties reported first cases found UK variant earlier week. 

I can't even blame people much since media reported first two cases variant, can't believe one bit new variant already spreading Seattle-area least major metro areas country.

Probably yes. testing two dose regiment too, take months. need MSc specialist know true. day we're shouting people understand other. Maybe quiet lab stand next tolerable. year empirically verify nobody understand other, especially street anywhere little bit noise.

This might best 24 hours pandemic far. lying speaking truth. sometimes plainly lying.

When say US first defeat covid, mean? covid killed 433k people far America, matter America now, likely considered triumph, unless definition defeating covid 1 person left without covid. 

The title also wrong common sense. Even effective vaccine, many people already got covid lives forever fucked, America missed boat 'crushing' covid even everything scientifically correct based current understanding. counter arguing point vaccinating 10x less US (155,000/day 1/10th 1.5 million) pointing much, much less 24000 per day. figured vaccination rate per capita country compared... else would suggest? originally reusing masks almost 2 weeks, dropped method soon got hands cloth reusables later, disposables could get bulk.

Nope nope nope nope. feel super sanitary hour 4, feel much better getting rid mask since I'm janitor, want run risk days old toilet fumes in. long literally yeeting masks window, im this. got new strain game over. slowly approve vaccines we'll never rid this.

Moderna applied November 30, got approval December 18. 18 days, major holidays between.

If J&amp;J applies middle next week (February 3) --- approval Friday February 19, 16 days later, probably best case scenario. Twitter way making look like dumb comments prevailing narrative. would almost like Reddit switched default setting “controversial” sorting comments didn’t tell you.

I've seen AZ offered 8- 10 million doses UK end March they've rejected insisting want full amount. ridiculous. producing 2 million week UK supply chains. even meet eu's total amount. eu's demands completely unreasonable. gotten shit together issue. Nevermind insisted negotiating something actually well outside purview public health matters supposed matter still handled individual governments instead decided behave like federal government- not. lot drama nothing then... assume germany still use 65s  disagree sentiment. rich countries ones created vaccines give free poor countries. anyone complain. weren’t rich begin wouldn’t tha ability create it. countries supposed vaccinate citizens? citizens pay existing drugs funded research infrastructure develop vaccine. nothing won’t cry foul about? Turkey EU's average vaccination rates using Sinovac. abmassive county. mean, hospitalizations, severe illness, deaths decrease, undoubtedly wonderful. (and, based people saying comments, many others too) feel comfortable stepping isolation solely based 66% effective vaccine. really think life go back normal based vaccine. good enough. father law got covid vaccine. one entire house get it, second shot got extremely sick positive covid. vaccine joke Tyler Perry 2nd prominent black celebrity to.get vaccine publicly didnt last night....there long way go say black celebrities initiated vaccine outreach campaign previously implied already underway  would really interested see 2-dose regimen j&amp;j first dose, mRNA second dose would do. could rapid deployment 'hold people over' get really good stuff. EU bought 2 billion doses total. Uhhh much lower December peak even funny. headlines man. neighbor ER Dr top totem pole terms pay. openly admits less exposure spends less time room Covid patients lower totem pole. Nursea direct contact patient spend lot time patient least also get paid pretty well. Unfortunately behind scenes works get crap pay direct contact patients’s biohazards. good temperature requirements strict. knowing Pfizer Moderna's shots 95% effective, kinda really still want either those. I'd rather get Covid, even severe shot. course people get Pfizer Moderna's help boost efficacy Johnson Johnson herd about, ya know? 34% chance still getting covid? mean that’s fact. Lol. Media businesses, care best them, what’s best society.

I also worry politicians quick relinquish authority... easy start restrictions, let go difficult.

In end, may people get real. see low hospitalizations extended period get shot? Fucking go party live life! Seriously, we’re picking vaccine marry, - we’re looking something that’ll date around get shit figured out.

Maybe bad analogy, second thought. we’re hoping immunize globe - anything effective helps. Canada enough doses vaccinate population 4 times Measures come concerns new variants coronavirus mount. cost testing hotel stay estimated 2.000 dollars. Yes initial doses 5.1. going circles.

Agree. can't let perfect get way good. need approve Oxford J&amp;J Novavax distribute like WW3 educated guess. 

This ok. 1 shot shows pretty similar vaccine single shots. perfect world would see ensemble 2 data (2 doses), hope/guess second dose see higher efficacy 80 90%. 

But us pushing people get least one shot. arguing moderna pfizer spaces 12 weeks (data doesnt support) . shots lower efficacy brings curve doesnt provide herd immunity unless extremely high amount get vaccine. 

What think happen:

We take advantage this. helps dosage count, storage, transport (rural areas) get sooner. come 12 16 weeks ensemble 2 gets published. Data looks better efficacy. gets approved two doses may june. Everyone gets second dose. still leg pfizer moderna due storage transport close efficacy.

This different Astrazenaca . Az two doses good efficacy millions questions data terrible transparency. get good trial data half dose full dose may change new people everyone already got full dose. like September, 100 million nearly enough lift restrictions. nice media use terms vaccines instead manipulating news.

95% efficacy preventing COVID-19 (BioNTech)

70% effective protecting symptomatic disease (AstraZeneca)

50% overall effectiveness (Sinovac)

100% Effective Stopping Deaths (J&amp;J) bigger deal acknowledged moment. one goals vaccine get people go back participate economy, they're going need able say whether vaccine reduces (potentially long-term even permanent) effects mild even asymptomatic cases. I'm risking losing lung capacity get haircut. receive full amount need support large spend money stocks Amazon. spend rent, food, clothing like. 

People making 75k basically receive nothing. use AZ stock first shot save maybe yes. Hopefully job bring cases/deaths everybody calm down. pandemic turning people levels Great news see yet another vaccine coming! Hopefully availability various vaccines running enough stock vaccinate planet &amp; totally eradicate COVID-19. Thanks! Let know see anything add! understand sentiment. want kid next year so, it’s pretty important get effective vaccine possible since contracting covid whole pregnant lead pretty poor outcomes. Also, asthma want fuck around something could impair lung function asthma already has. 

If lived rural area wasn’t likely get Pfizer Moderna, maybe would feel differently. it’s hard accept take less effective vaccine perfectly capable waiting better one. opinion. Others disagree, wish people would stop assuming it’s okay decide feel something actually affects me. 

I don’t pose significant risk spreading virus don’t significant risk contracting it. don’t go anywhere, neither husband. We’ve taken extra precautions since state exploded cases - example, dishwasher broken, we’re waiting replaced don’t want people house installing new one. We’ve washing dishes hand since thanksgiving. 

Sorry. guess needed rant. Thanks listening. I'm sure got vaccine last week, would done publicly.

The vaccine prioritized based age pre-existing health conditions, it'll Lebron James gets vaccine. TL;DR: 594,000 May 1 That's fine. understand lot folks fanciful aspirations millionaire billionaire ""working hard"", ones claws resources want share anyone. They'll never super rich people, let reality settle in, finally fight people level, secretly (or secretly) see peons. Well, love drama. Greenleaf Scandal favorite black shows. Whenever someone asks favorite beer is, answer always same.

It's one front me.

Don't miss opportunity vaccinate. miss opportunity test. money tax credit. 

* CDC “actively looking” mandating Covid tests domestic flights.  
* Travel industry groups say plan would “unworkable,” Covid testing availability varies. 
* Airlines lost record $34 billion last year, bookings expected weak early 2021. purely ignorant comment. 

You’re conveniently leaving supply extremely limited right now. US giving vaccine supply countries right don’t even enough take care citizens yet?

Who hell supposedly raping pillaging right now? one article it: disagree here. two vaccines 90+ efficacy Novavax, almost 90%.

There need put manufacturing resources J&amp;J AstraZeneca vaccines sub-par. resources dedicated higher efficacy rates.

These guys tried, came short. Let go. think get attention? idea improve compliance? number people hospitalised France COVID-19 rose 1,000 last two days, trend unseen since Nov. 16, number patients intensive care units disease exceeded 3,000 first time since Dec. 9. Combining Pfizer, Moderna AZ, seems attainable Q1. Probably even 15% Pfizer boosting capability imminent production AZ. indians handled good. I'm 100%. deeply frustrating. enough vaccines everybody, I'm guessing country going throw away Pfizer doses give country. already paid money gone, administering Pfizer costly others. close Pfizer vaccination centers administer AZ &amp; JJ general practitioners. think likely able get mRNA vaccine much money (possibly free) late spring early summer. local governments' best interests vaccinate many people possible, Pfizer Moderna vaccines flooding US time stick manufacturing projections. started process them! scheduled yet there.  Kinda feels like news lately pretty bad. saw manufacturers listing N95 masks website pre-covid prices ($23 20 pack--$1.2 per N95 mask). bought couple boxes (essential mental health worker) saw sold next day. Keep eyes manufacturers' websites. Seems like 4chan post last year pandemic spot especially new Brazilian variant. see youre saying, medical personnel deployed areas ICUs completely overrun. ICU care needs much specialized nurse giving vaccines. nurse nursing student give vaccines. cannot said ICU care, bit apples oranges comparison. 

I admittedly knowledgeable military's involvement administering vaccines, even would best suited, give boost medical personnel, sure, push comes shove- think nursing could administer ton shots. We've bigger issues holding us back far administering vaccines goes. answer don’t know. everyone vaccinated doesn’t matter *shrug* extra context needed? numbers speak themselves. Compared rest world, US European countries handled things pretty equally terms actual numbers. vaccinated spread it? happens cannot get vaccinated, like children? article? join rest us 2021 give us vax prevents disease first place from? here! honestly think partial immunity countries extremely risky, sounds like would applying greater pressure virus escape vaccines countries herd immunity doesn’t mean “warehouses full extra vaccine doses” sitting around 

So, hoarding then. Actually vaccinating people, paying vaccinate poorer countries help it. Jog far, Covax raised $6bn, scheme says needs least another $2bn meet global vaccination target 2021.
The UK government provided $734m (£548m) US pledged $4bn (£2.93bn) December.
One President Biden's first acts office sign US Covax. Awesome! f'in stupid anyway. get citizens vaccinated give rats ass others stop virus mutating. morons travel whatever reason bring new mutated strain back country. literally modern economic imperialism too. We'll pillage poor benefit, screw over. lot interesting info logistics mRNA vaccine manufacturing. Q1 Q2 delivery targets still check definitely isn’t time abandon hope. Canada squeezes 6 doses Pfizer using low-dead volume syringes hand (with millions arriving next week onwards) 700,000 vials equal 4.2M doses. Currently Sask. squeezing extra doses even without right syringes hand we’re able time. actually didn’t know they’d ordered syringes back summer, thought they’d blindsided this. Thanks volunteering study, seriously. way, unblind results out? saying time here. People really overestimating anti vaxx wackos everybody around gets vaccine visibly works, resistance minimal.

I worried vaccine passports. want vaccine, get soon possible, want banned travelling due something fault matter? Think minute. someone offered J&amp;J tomorrow, turn 2/3 efficacy? blackjack odds I'd take second.

I know someone waiting particular vaccine evidence one guarantee cannot xmit longer wear mask, unlike vaccines...? - J&amp;J.

Both sake catching first place I'm vaccinated, long-term effects COVID, getting first vaccine *anyone* give me. 

I asthma put cortisone, methypredisone nebulizers count point - every time happens, lungs damaged I'm started steroids. 

I know feels like able breathe. I've become practically shut-in due damn virus reason. owned O2 finger monitor COVID. thought hospitalization and/or BiPaP breathing assistance scares hell I've hospital O2 nebulizers before.

Take whatever vaccine get soon get it. Augment later 95% ones get J&amp;J, turn vaccine led ZERO deaths/hospitalizations double-blind. brilliant original idea Australia New Zealand had. 

Love, China South Korea Vietnam. 6-9 months seems like longer timeframe minds Hmm. Thanks sharing. know think now. Yeah I'm worried they'll fold masks new stable equilibrium ""new normal"" ""it's piece cloth."" think vaccine studied that. Researchers followup studies confirm potential transmission. Early indications transmission greatly reduced, lack confirmation wear masks social distance vaccinate next three months. Oh, heller there! Reasonable - probably assume there’s margin error involved reported media as, y’know, shit happens splitting hairs would probably confusing necessary. 

Great news general though. Yes natural herd immunity

Plus Uncle Sam taking away vaccines rest world mean, right, impact countries' supplies, rest world never going get richest countries placed orders enough doses vaccinate populations several times over... Extreme hypocrisy vaccine nationalism display.

Luckily, world getting doses China Russia. Moving goal posts much ? never asserted anything respect overall contract, solely respect interpretation sites included 5.1. Excellent rundown! study random testing? see signs it. I'm vaccinating teachers first. also think prioritising healthcare workers elderly makes sense too. I'm medical centers ignoring state guidelines making priority groups vaccinate case here.

If Georgia last list vaccine rollout say, removing priority groups vaccinating age would speed things up. Also say legislators preferred list article agree given priority. Lots people “medicine” refuse get vaccine. don’t put lot stock opinions point, unless they’re physicians specializing infectious disease. Moderna expected ship 20-25 per cent less product Canada February originally planned, overall Canada ordered far vaccines needs.

Saved click. There’s absolutely nothing wrong mRNA vaccines, even were, Oxford vaccine isn’t mRNA vaccine either. understand think understand need two doses vaccine? take it, sounds like shot 65% prevent disease, prevent lessens severity. Compared moderna Pfizer 95% prevent

Someone correct I'm wrong though good black entertainment recommend watch? Somebody's getting time pay! Although sounds like getting paid waiting spare shot anyway think enough discipline. They're almost certainly going say Moderna/Pfizer healthcare workers/65+ people leave dollar store knockoffs everyone else, including so-called 'essential/hero' workers. country approved Moderna/Pfizer nothing else yet eligible need figure way get one asap crap vaccines authorized. especially applies high risk 65. Good guys Canada! afraid EU USA Vaccinated ""most people"" starts traveling unvaccinated countries consequences would start vaccination. point orders needed huge amount money needed set mass vaccine manufacturing sites.

Manufacturing sites UK equipment ordered site time EU committed AZ vaccine. Manufacturing sites dedicated serving EU three months behind dedicated serving UK. hope remedies issue catch UK. Lives need saving right now, months now. Nope. bar got moved nefarious reasons. It’s time accept media politicians are. don’t go Q me, realize there’s truth MSM things clicks best interest public mental health. Canada, nice Pfizer build factory North America worry export controls countries. Oh wait.... Especially delivering product 'at cost' - it'd plain daft tie contractually.

The EU going AZ - especially wrong - going de-incentivise companies things, long-term going harmful. would say they’re okay (his plays slightly better), yeah, agree leading example. see deliveries info clause 5.1 refers doses manufactured within EU. says make best effort manufacture EU, initial doses come EU.

If contract says I'm buying ten apples says should, best reasonable effort, grown Italy, still get apples even grown there, no? Exactly! hopeful start opening things summer! Yeah big difference here. US UK (to lesser extent) open start. EU go approach allowed exports. result, countries based vaccine strategies EU procurements. EU policy start countries would sought different strategy, one wouldnt leave vaccines incompetents EU scramble recover position. Dutch coming win!!

This beats fly sticker urinal Schiphol Airport back 90's!! two shots dramatically better one shot.

Thing is, even one shot mRNA vaccine pretty damn good. I’ve seen number floating around mRNA vaccines somewhere around 50-60% effective one dose, read actual papers, feel like that’s misinterpretation data.

That number comes number people got diagnosed COVID first shot trial, second dose. look Kaplan-Meier curves, see vast majority occurred within first 10 days getting first dose... suggesting people *already infected* COVID either first dose, vaccine time work. look period around day 11-14 onward, protection first dose seems one dose alone. 

It’s difficult tell, people got 2nd doses either day 21 day 28, it’s big length time you’re looking at. feeling looked people got one dose vaccine, you’d still see efficacious. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

NFL gross anyway, even COVID  yeah absolutely! believe stuff progressively opened risk population vaccinated. hopefully summer northern emisphere helps too. anemics whose red blood cells already strike excited try fun survivor themed challenge. Fuck ! latter argument also widely heard recently: EU managed negotiate low prices, back pack cheap attitude. Nonsense, Natsis thinks. “That narrative useful pharmaceutical companies. know initially charged ridiculous prices happy EU used influence bring down. ”

&amp;#x200B;

The AZ contract, EU partnership Oxford, outright say company can't make profit. publicly traded company people know try. Suggesting EU good thing bringing price disingenuous. haggle price question saved. cost drug.

The EU narrative poor. money used build factories sell later vaccines profit (around June so?) study 44k, size subset used draw conclusion? Moderate cases still mean substantial damage Yeah definitely cold call them. Honestly would even go person can't get through, try make appointment yourself. That's would least.

My in-laws got appointments calling every Rite-Aid East Bay one one got lucky. knows still work though :\\ need kind confirmation actually allowed get Moderna Pfizer vaccine later year get J&amp;J one spring. Authorities need extremely clear expect lots people settle J&amp;J one now. Thanks contributing additional info. relieved misunderstood! It’s good news new vaccine protects serious illness SA variant high rate. 

Yes, milieu new vaccines coming fore think reason optimism. still worry “long haul” effects people experience originally mild cases, curious whether vaccines offer protection sequelae, good news welcome. Americans waiting EMA, ate waiting AZ American trial results I'm NJ eligible vaccine shopping around different places trying find somewhere make appointment. sites I've visited tell vaccine (It's Moderna me) Everyone.....maybe everyone social media, anyone reading reputable sources medical research CY2020 knew mutations Seriously. I'm grateful living boyfriend times, get annoyed see people claiming they're sooo happy they're introverted spending lots time partner (sometimes) kids. ""isolating"" defined actually away humans, simply spending almost 100% time favorite people! EU breached published best effort contract

This lie. AZ never published problems were, occured, would fixed. AZ shipped vaccine *out* EU facilities. AZ done best fulfill contract comes bizarre excuses EU ""late"". contract contract, AZ promised 80M doses, best effort, actively acted *against* goal. Maybe goal never reachable first place, close fraudulent. Yeah that. Q1 targets window without delay Moderna.

Also Pfizer said sold doses, vials. get 6 doses per vial instead 5? Great we're going send 15% less vials.

Fuck Pfizer. Made smile :-) can't expect thanksgiving christmas

I hate way people phrasing stuff like this. get point they're making (even vehemently disagree) linguistically creepy fuck. Nobody ""take away"" holiday, especially government. late last year saw many posts like ""You guys wear masks enough government taking away thanksgiving ""guess family get christmas year anti-maskers"". weird. Exactly. 2nd dose, 132% effective virus. late spring early summer - Fauci

&amp;#x200B;

get back us 6 months. So, many kids going mentally stunted rest lives this? point, exactly. Michigan, never holiday spike. fact, us rest upper Midwest holiday decline. confused. point? Russia China shipped doses middle- lower-income countries right now. article provided dispute that. says India plans producing AstraZeneca vaccine domestic use export. That's great news, dispute said. also cut hair year. 

I weak lungs due spinal cord injury I've isolating lot last haircut summer. 

Me year: ""My hair long swear go cut get vaccine, Feb-March priority group 2"". guess inspired Playoff Beards.

Government British Columbia last week: ""We vaccines; we're moving toomanywheels later group 3 starting Apr-June. Get hairy toomanywheels!"". 5.1 contract states AZ use “best reasonable effort” produce initial doses within EU. say done possible. 

However, 5.4 crystal clear UK plants included manufacturing infrastructure. 

The argument “best reasonable effort” fulfill AZ’s obligation EU include using facilities needed. That’s facilities listed contract “manufacturing sites”. it’s pretty striking Commission trying conduct argument public statement. That’s good sign. 

That’s time bring court. Vaccines needed now, two years. without doxxing myself, obviously. record, supposition open schools ""only"" 537 people 15 24 died disgusting. Every one young people missed living full life, grieving families. get they're counting ""not severe"" also nobody hospitalized. DVT definitely going hospital time start smoking happens. Might bit harsh, without even knowing period time study referring to, number doesn’t really mean anything me. Wtf didn’t since LAST YEAR MARCH? i'll try walgreens cvs's today, honestly getting ridiculous. reason grandmother able get vaccine arm right SF able it. don’t get stay largest trading bloc world long term partners see unreliable untrustworthy. Companies countries divest look elsewhere. feel that, really do. flair indicates, I'm biologist (though immunologist) *inhaling* every scientific paper that's come last year. I've taking things incredibly seriously, complying every mandate.

But also human, mental health deteriorating social isolation. depression getting real bad, I've gaining weight, sometimes can't sleep night.

We need focus unity here. need get *together*. *will* get this, *together*. I've seen today comments floating around here, U.S. need another messaging campaign J&amp;J rollout.

Here's message: ""Take vaccine offered. Yes, mRNA vaccines slightly effective preventing infection. J&amp;J perfectly good preventing important: death hospitalization. Especially young adult, wait Pfizer Moderna available. think special get vaccinated. sooner get shot, sooner go back life.""

Possibly biased whingers around here, I'm little frustrated appear young adults saying ""Hmm... way make sure get Pfizer Moderna rather J&amp;J? 70% effective..."" without realizing absolutely incredible, possibly low end (especially young people especially considering may slight boost protection time) importantly need getting shots arms ASAP put behind us. Interestingly, got sick March visited doctor O2 91%. HR crazy high BP crazy high well, course think Covid cough, fever (clinical anyway), breathing trouble. get test, later blood panels follow visits doc told it.

So guess counted ""severe"".  time got ... modify post since it’s obviously way date. didn’t suggest that. airline executives did. 
They want everybody vaccinated cross fingers hope. They’re going demand covid test domestic flights. Hell, aren’t now. Neither US government. 
Any requirements international flights international component highly influenced destination country. 
Somebody cited Hawaii requiring test. take test you’re still home, would effectively stranded.  go QC redditor likes puns That's bad, though seem like places least kicking gear, even took 4 extra weeks. encouraging see us around 6.5% nationally going million doses day clip. keep posing everything question without answering anything. 

Please defend fucking position. 

What problems expecting? know statistically significant? they're still getting sick they're likely still infectious risk developing long hauler [blood [having organ (asymptomatics mildly infected cases get this). correct I'm wrong seem anything stating get J&amp;J, longer get one mrna ones. would get one available way sooner? always get better one later think effective treatments point care coming around end year. I’m one them! 

It’s gotta said though. yet metric plan except vague point-counterpoint stuff. sister one teacher, one school. teach Title 1 school high rate poverty, well. Believe not, people diverse different perspectives things, even within industries professions. elderly people know got vaccinated told one signed up.  blessed local friend group lives close keep tight circle still hang normally. weren’t would bad way mentally thanks joe Biden course. Obama. Bigger family christmas gatherings + traveling rural Mexico holidays nobody cares corona returning infect everyone said larger families. exactly mystery. many people die this? went cases low area last year got foot cut off. still much shorter used best decision I've ever made. I'll probably keep short over. surprised guys went buzz cut stick going forward. That’s medical experts saying news know, want calm this, media fear mongering making *really* hard keep emotions. driving bus? not, completely empty.  risk people vaccinated then, hardly think 20-30s gonna stay indoors another summer wait vaccinate population isn’t even gonna get sick it’s free here. You’re getting upset problem made head lmao get vaccine available kids -- we're going get herd immunity 78% population (only 64% say would even take vaccine) evidence besides “I read internet?”

Anything? ROll out! embarrassing sentiment part world. safe highly efficacious (86%) vaccine China's production capacities unrivaled. kind discrimination present Sputnik vaccine first. China Russia ones supplying middle- lower-income countries, thankfully.

This incorrect. India far biggest vaccine producer world, exporting Oxford-AstraZenica take anything away China Russia though. vaccine works vaccine works. alameda county, I've got county list, state list, i've got calling kaiser (her provider) weekly. say enough supply. thinking looking mass site alameda today though cold calling. can't imagine live near young, healthy, essential worker want whatever helps people survive. Thank you! source 2 kids dying school covid? 121 kids nationwide age 14 died covid. Even among 15 24 year olds, 537 died. forgive little skeptical claim. think force necessary. guess lot people compliant NPI like distancing masking want lift restrictions get shots. Let's patient getting riled up! Thank you. appreciate follow ~30% hospitalizations ages 18-49. Young people dying much, sent hospital hefty rate. definitely almost zero risk getting trucked thing young healthy person. either edgelords folks don’t yet understand value one’s health. time do, probably late them. advantage deal (now managed) chronic health issues - place high value health maintaining it. meant adjusting lifestyle sacrificing year (not good others, avoid fate long term issues worse) - would’ve sacrificed anything avoid adding health issues plate. things friends/acquaintances endured wouldn’t wish worst enemy, mention future may may staring down. year hunkering (which benefits life) nothing compared potential lifetime added suffering. Medical experts cnn said option get get Moderna Pfizer later it’s available Interesting shit people hating USA close end (especially USA first crush pandemic thread), like UK closer also managed pandemic horribly haven’t heard slander abt them. Makes think lololol Damn right.

Gotta get shots arms first protect hospitals... happens still maintain restrictions... I’m you. open face sandwich since there's one piece ""bread""? lol

But yes get saying, either bad news good*** news. Gotta give people reason stay tuned. exactly flu 1918 though. happen often mean can't happen.  Novavax's trial US started Dec 28. two-course injection, three weeks apart. going little able publish results. Unless FDA determines UK trial good enough, might come online May so, especially case rates US dropping precipitously. 

AZ could potentially come online that, though. started trial Novavax expect apply emergency use US sometime spring. Part $1.2B US granted AZ bring vaccine manufacturing online US, theory US domestic supply AZ vaccine approved. Correct.

Thing is, imagine applying seemingly popular logic top comments real life: “we’ll make best efforts deliver local distribution centre, can’t we’re obligation deliver even one”.

Seems ridiculous, right? two issues unconnected. Thanks yes, good point. working home right now.

I live alone lonely literally see humans face face 6 days week. (and one day exception seeing parents weekend). hold summer means get effective ones. Welcome 21st century, EU. form orderly queue wait vaccines produced, we'll right you. I’m going agree disagree. -46%. That's huge decrease mobility. data seems indicate people did, fact, change behavior.  cares easy one small part parts make impossible? LOL 

7B people even getting current vaccine like 2-3 years. someone explain criticism nursing home issue several states? seems problem several governors gotten serious heat really see good way issue handled.

Someone living nursing home (or assisted living, residential care setting) goes hospital X. Maybe chest pain, they've fall, COVID symptoms. test positive COVID there. symptoms require hospitalization two weeks, supposed go? Because, especially capacity issues we've talking year, hospital probably cannot support keeping people weeks time actually need acute care.

Being nursing home implies can't live (and like home nursing home) family can't support caring level need. hospital right place them, family member's home right place them, nursing home right place them, patients sent to? seems solution would quickly build staff entire infrastructure quarantining patients returned usual care setting (almost like transitional care unit surgery accident). Total population NJ = 8.9 million, 13% age 65+ = 1.16 million, 130k shots per week = 9 weeks first shot everyone group, 680k already given, maybe half group half health care workers. Seems like elderly least one shot within weeks.

I mean hear you, pace seems glacial. I'm Virginia received 1.1 million doses 500k sitting storage can't get organized. Awesome performance past couple days. 1.5 million per day becoming new average, there's reason believe slow production increases coming. Hope 2 million per day couple weeks, still need wrap first groups get next phases rollout. 

It's frustrating waiting state move 'phase 3' includes people 65. Apparently one holdup amount people deciding turn shot, leads less used thus less distributed state. Fortunately, overall Oklahoma actually average distribution far, surprising. look last two sentences 5.4, contract states happen “If AstraZeneca unable deliver intention manufacture initial Europe doses..”. states available CMOs EU (which includes U.K.) shall used, reference schedule A. schedule (page 39) explicity list several U.K. plants substance manufacturing REDACTED (FR/BE), REDACTED (I/NL), REDACTED (UK) REDACTED (UK).”
“Drug product manufacturing REDACTED (ITL), REDACTED (DE), REDACTED (UK) potential suppliers”.** entire thing would've gone better lie American people think they'll understand truth. still spread asymptomatic. 

Which adults prioritized. adult vaccinations taken care of, worrying kids spread pointless. Unfortunately main vaccine pre-purchased NZ. efficacy rate low would useless us since elimination strategy can't open borders 90% population immunity.  mind wearing mask little bit longer. holy geez would like able go buy toilet paper Wal-Mart again. I’m excited. state vaccinated almost first group, including 75+. Next two three weeks knock 65+. around time J&amp;J Novavax vaccines start rolling out, given numbers J&amp;J could totally see open general public risk people get moderna/Pfizer one. compels find contractors (CMOs) EU chooses info effectiveness second dose delayed weeks? Putting J&amp;J vaccine young people necessarily high-risk giving Pfizer Moderna vaccines high-risk demographics would best bet return normal summer. false negatives serology testing due antibodies waning. 

It's unlikely massive reservoir people SARS-CoV-2 North Dakota get tested large surge, tested around 25% total population average twice unique test positivity rate never exceeded 18.3%. positivity rate, maximum number people could infected overall would around double. Anything greater would exceed population state. AZ signed two legally binding contracts UK EU (UK first may matter legally). AZ meet orders (again, whether illegal due contracts) EU wants ensure met banning export AZ vaccine UK. AZ vaccine part made within EU make EU doses. private trading issue EU AZ made diplomatic.


Outside vaccine issue massive deal Ireland/NI. 'hard border' sticking point Brexit could threaten Good Friday Agreement. believed EU tried negotiate lower prices (compared US) vaccine contracts made. article States lots companies tried ask high prices initially. AZ never place give lower prices EU negotiate lower price, vaccine already sold cost world. ""negotiating lower prices"" actually explicitly includes vaccine contracts. contracts EU could pull prices of. AZ cost already. particular quoted part used disingenuous way person above. That's fair question. far make out, situation is:

* AZ promised profit Covid-19 vaccine ""during pandemic"". That's separate developing nations pledge, perpetuity.
* Pam Cheng, Astra’s vice-president operations, fleshed promise, stating: “From cost goods perspective able manufacture dollars per dose.” EU paying $2.18 per dose, US $4 per dose, UK somewhere around $4.11 per dose. Yes please! 

Do know USA purchased enough Pfizer Moderna get everyone vaccinated? work home would agree. you’re like can’t I’ll take whatever get it’s better nothing. Given bad lot (accurate) news months ago, think lot people conflate pessimism truth two mutually exclusive. also don’t know medical history. could number health conditions allow eligible. I'm saying wear more/the best gear. I'm saying messed done help people we're expected go risk lives. Yes double up. Absolutely. Agreed think matter access get 2 shot get can't one shot better nothing

i want people think equal alternative choose access both. Regardless thoughts Ben Shapiro something said early people right starting criticize Fauci stuck me. 

He said Fauci infectious disease doctor. going focus one single factor knows suggest best way handle it. However cannot use single-factor analysis comes making public policy thus Fauci shouldn’t end comes policy making. you? child psychology field? Getting downvoted California sub pushing back someone saying reopen schools kids vaccinated could develop long-term chronic complications asymptotic infection. evidence suggests covid less dangerous kids flu knowledge enrolled children age 12 vaccine trials. People really think keep schools closed every student vaccinated? wanna talk ethics? AZ would directly kill UK citizens paid vaccine.

Ultimately, whole mess caused EU's delay. signed UK did, production would three months ahead right now.

The UK shall pay EU's mistake.  would worry get J&amp;J vaccine would lower priority get one better ones. might make sense get J&amp;J vaccine wait effective ones available again. take vaccine live forever? Honestly think big reason we're pushing continued masks distancing Pfizer Moderna vaccines keep people lying vaccinated excuse ignore public guidelines. makes sense mental gymnastics going justify reasons. Lol don’t even qualify money don’t need it

But pretend like normal situation take context pandemic equally ridiculous. say fuck million Americans, let die, mention millions may long term health consequences disease could cost far inflation ridiculous. 

Our number 1 priority minimizing loss life, keeping nation healthy. deal economic issues after. 

We seem endless amounts “handouts” comes bailing businesses never anything help Americans. Apparently yes. Theoretically, take J&amp;J available let's say six months later, there's enough Pfizer produced, take then. That’s misleading. News alert headline earlier said 85% effective. I'm sure we'll give gonna vaccines give away Novavax vaccine 96% effective vanilla COVID, 89,% effective UK variant 49% effective South Africa COVID (although remove comorbid HIV 60%).  still doesn’t make sense. problems:

1.	That sentence refers initial doses optional doses, clear applies considered separately, gives rise interpretative issues above.
2.	you “it’s still conflict 5.1” issue.
3.	you fact “intention ... agreement” must referencing obligation 5.1, EU excludes UK.
4.	even torture reading get want, still obligation increase capacity - AZ could say “yes, notified us CMOs UK, contracted increase capacity, discharged obligation”. doesn’t get EU vaccines. It’s strained reading either - AZ say point provision ensure free capacity relevant 5.1 (ie EU27 capacity).
5.	has EU even noticed AZ UK CMOs?

I note still haven’t addressed point think contract carefully drafted exclude UK EU 5.1. best position could take EU really fucked it’s Input drafting, good position end (especially looks like EU’s terms - ie using AZ paper - guessing here). summer 2021 bucket list:

- Get plastered concert stadium filled thousands people zero social distancing, proof vaccine, mask requirements

- Make person met

- Go fair/festival

Gotta aim high, dude. [The EU approved AZ's vaccine Mask wearing, maybe, changing behavior way, strong wishful thinking. least California. EU business. I’m sorry. 

You free buy use anything want. But, EU EU first. really sorry. EU started war. - new variants still mitigated vaccines small drop effectiveness I've seen science sister sub one. 
- many variants already global. 

If vaccine effective would understand. might agree, would understand increasing restrictions vs status quo reducing them. information vaccination effective, make sense smells like ""doing something show something"" interventionist government policy 101. enough vaccine people want it. need convince anyone vaccine.

A true idol Canadian lower middle class Tour de France, maybe? UK plants allowed used AZ without asking permission EC import them. There’s nothing obliging AZ divert supply there. read would know that. deliberately disingenuous?  *This*. Infection equal disease. Since think responses making clear:

If need 80% population vaccinated achieve herd immunity, cannot happen children younger 12 cannot vaccinated. Period. need vaccinate children (after trials make clear safe effective). Incredibly misleading borderline false. sure first Pfizer/Moderna vaccine actually prevent infection, muted symptoms. we're fairly sure prevents infection first place, meaning can't spread COVID. still infected COVID getting vaccinated, much rare exception, rule. get infected, symptoms less severe, ""**all** [the] vaccine prevent severe symptoms"" bullshit, that's *all* agree.

This say nothing concerned people need take breath keep perspective. infinite supply mRNA vaccines right might right. sounds like important thing speed. think it’s better get many people possible vaccinated ASAP even people use somewhat less-effective vaccine, compared unvaccinated people running around longer period time wait mRNA vaccine production ramp meet demand. small steps compared worlds mass vaccine drive successfully completed heavily using military.

You go guard center pick vaccines. media giving balanced perspective this. make money fear. Calm little bit log - things going OK. current outlook virus MUCH positive would believe constantly reading news. schools take much money students feel obligation look them. I’ve seen one instance like first Chiefs game year outbreak group luxury box haven’t seen anything normal seating bowl would be? thing control prevents export AZ vaccine UK. think happen? novavax approved? look break populations novavax performs better. 95 percent Covid-19, 85 percent South African variant. vaccine make claim. issue stemmed AZ contracts. contracts problem. 4) Invoke wartime powers acts 'take over' AZ Europe immediate executive decree. probably excuse it’s previous government’s fault (who hasn’t power since 2015).

I'm saying going perfect solution ever Covid magically disappear forever, certain point, people get tired told allowed optimistic. know saying this, someone quote wag fingers telling wrong very, concerned be. 

It is...

Efficacy severe disease increased time cases vaccinated participants reported day Janssen COVID-19 vaccine candidate demonstrated complete protection COVID-related hospitalization death, 28 days post-vaccination. clear effect vaccine COVID-19 cases requiring medical intervention (hospitalization, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)), reported cases among participants received Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, 28 days post-vaccination.

The 66% ""overall"" efficacy appears average multiple figures different efficacies different severities time periods.

But think people care ultimate efficacy serious illness lot higher 66%. 90% sub STILL dismissing mutations. mention issue gets downvoted. Yeah, data far crap US trial finish another couple months.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Eventually people realize goals companies announce almost always gross exaggerations non Europeans, responsible European culture/s

Yes, Byzantine, Ottoman, ancient Egyptian shaped called ""Western culture"" now. must've never learn history.  point surgeons germs escaping mask. done studies whether 30% still transmit disease? Since even asymptomatic people transmit disease kind figured 30% gain immunity would still transmit disease got infected.  odd since modern anti vax movement largely driven doctor UK. We're lucky effect relatively small here. unfortunately accurate. Chicago teaching union basically said refuse let teachers go back schools without vaccine. state included vaccine list believe officially start getting vaccinated today. 

But end happening union pull plug teachers complain paid enough deal restrictions. mention soon one case variant school haven’t 100% ensured vaccine effective pull plug. Copying comment thread.

For anyone scoffing 66-80% efficacy compared +90% efficacy mRNA vaccines...

First I'm still pretty impressed given *single* dose, offers enormous logistical advantages.

And I'm grateful even *have* multiple working vaccines less year first cases. never take granted forget incredible collective achievement is!

Most people world even able get vaccinated 2022. end personally getting 70% efficacy vaccine next couple months (instead mRNA vaccines), still incredibly fortunate privileged position in. never take granted forget incredible collective achievement is!

You absolutely right. little let read efficacy, right. Let's count blessings here. maybe ""Covid Zero"" people, rest us headline fails focus important result: 100% prevention hospitalization/death 49 days!!! change want see world... cancel stop reading stuff makes angry. Life short. Granted, there's probably enough data vulnerable groups work vaccine efficacy either. Vulnerable people tend poorer immune systems like 65s. American here.

Curious law enforcement EU works. 

Lets say Spanish citizen, commit minor crime Germany take France police find you. weeks later, French police officer pulls speeding, runs ID find committed crime Germany. French officer arrest you? get deported Germany? Spanish government get involved all? Source? Damn utterly pathetic. They've much time ramp production. Bolsonaro uses smoke screen.

It's effective. talking about? Novavax press release clearly states efficacy vaccine. information cryptic difficult understand.

I beginning think trolling. case not, here's press release sort disagreement this, provide peer-reviewed scientific evidence refutes claim.

EDIT: Also, attacking rather claim. someone disagrees you, mean they're children uneducated. That's crock shit. dumb enough doubts vaccine, pass line. another bullshit excuse rich cutting line.  don’t think thank Fuck that, want best vaccine get.

The best vaccine get one available. 

It's far important many people possible get vaccinated quickly possible get one. Sorry, that's public health. we've trying explain people year. flip side ""I'm healthy, wear mask house parties, fuck rest olds"" coin. fire antivaxers too. Teachers given vaccine, except jurisdictions schools already open.

That's fair amount places. Texas, many schools, all, open, currently seems school nurses health related workers eligible shots. US worse EU averages, several EU nations worse. EU average held Germany comparatively well. That's happens elect smart person instead conniving populist. 28 STAB WOUNDS, WANT LEAVE CHANCE, HUH? FEEL ANGER? HATE? BLEEDING, BEGGING MERCY, STABBED HIM, AGAIN!... KNOW KILLED HIM. SAY IT? SAY ""I KILLED HIM""! HARD SAY?! SAY KILLED HIM! SAY IT! Except trace origins virus based mutations along way. Understood, makes sense. 

Your take seems align others better insight legal system me

E.g largely normal summer Americans. Probably international travel massive concerts, bars, restaurants, movies, shows, things like full steam ahead.

I think worth stating majority people forum probably located US.  know it’s second dose adenovirus vaccine usually less effective body built immunity adenovirus well. could wrong that’s understanding  robust data vaccine pfizer/moderna. still robust data show effective is. know they're effective probably reduced efficiency vaccines well lead. 100%!!! Effective preventing hospitalizations deaths 49 days. Lower efficacy leading lot news outlets 😡 many doses? EU haggling pennies UK countries got it. Germany, France, Netherlands Italy cusp signing style deal rolled joint effort.

It's amazing EU delaying months mean face delays compared countries signed quickly. argue turn restaurant hour someone else get food first? Bizarre. That's goal, evidence actually met. also afraid happen. Unjustified. 66% efficacy seems low, none people got vaccine died covid. ad26 vaccine J&amp;J resulted 85% less hospitalisations. one shot vaccine! that, depression anxiety cause severe brain fog, record levels due pandemic. should, every research shown long term symptom strongly associated disease severity, vaccine good preventing severe disease good preventing long Covid. INFECTION ABSOLUTELY BRING IMMUNITY. STOP LIE.  mean, yeah? going arrogant it, check actual data rather graphic visualisation. See previous comment. case Pfizer, correct, drop 92 Sorry wasn’t clear. “They” = JNJ wonder US Aussie hicks stealing everything. Enjoy wasted year lockdowns! Take upvote telling fucking truth. necessarily. EU prove AZ breached contract, AZ refute. wording Best Reasonable Endeavours something effect. That, imagine wording AZ insisted on. argue that. legal waffle we'll try, binding wording. fetter responsibility.

It's clear cut seems expect EU really legal argument, they'd taken court privately following legal letters point, AZ would backed down. think public dispute EU legal leg stand want win public argument pressure AZ.  Even Israel sometimes included, losing status more. also 30%+ population already vaccinated. Yup. shouted fairness whole time comes it, problem trying screw countries alongside fairness stance. least US outright exporting months approvals.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* hell that? unacceptable. UK took seriously placed orders MUCH sooner EU. guys took risk placing orders early payed off. EU piss right lol Exactly. vaccines reduce covid nothing flu we've won.  That's choice us developing world single dose vaccine that's far cheaper way easier rollout (since require -20C storage) huge game changer. Great, works well enough approval, perfect healthy population Im joking. almost certainly apply EUA this. always another EUA 2-3 months two dose. ramp 3 million doses per day months time. Think key point one brought up, refers optional doses well. Moving away law speculation r.e. intentions, guessing inconsistency 5.1 5.4 deliberate EU wanted orders eventually fulfilled UK (e.g. including optional doses) wanted AZ set factories per 5.4. Consequently get referred Schedule. However, knew UK first dibs UK manufacturing 100m doses. Hence include 5.1 referring obligation deliver initial doses. hospitalizations deaths trial. That's really matters. forgive ignorant 66% considered good wit JNJ vaccine? Isnt Pfizer Moderna vaccine 90+? thing ridiculous AZ's PR department repeat propaganda.

You strangely obsessed AZ. I've already said care less AZ discussing *Oxford* trial, ran *Oxford* monitored MHRA. link case confused: constant attempts pretend speak anyone delusional self.

I think mixing delusional They're certainly misinformation. Thing is, aware article made post.

Ah yes course, that's fine it? hand literally contradicted article.

So hardly mal-intent otherwise linked it! seem contradictory trying salvage little remains self-dignity given whored AZ propaganda. 

Christ, discussing Oxford really, stop pretending. one still picking fight.

Well ridiculous. seem think there's sort conspiracy going here, get caught misinformation, oopsie daisy. adamant well makes funnier.

Regardless, conversation clearly run course... Viruses considered living things. fully open, without immunity guys back lockdowns there's immunity. Heard way vaccine weak. student’s step mom got first shot day negative test. Two days later became symptomatic tested positive. still got second shot weeks severely severely ill. Fevers 104+ least 4 days, wheezing coughing, low O2. She’s slowly getting better week later. Personally I'm worried it. Covid19 vaccines gone testing flu vaccine, overlapped testing production. also going get lot data folks getting vaccine first time qualify. Bold move Cotton, worked well Hank Aaron Babies 6 months receive flu shot highly encouraged pediatricians... Yeah, good news terms getting deaths severe health complications control, pretty depressing news terms getting social lives economy back normal. people offered J&amp;J Pfizer/Moderna better part year, it’s cheaper easier produce distribute, without continued social distancing masking still lot illness, won’t lead much hospitalization death. That’s good news reopening bars concert venues.

J&amp;J’s lack effectiveness SA variant would suggest variant take others, meaning would still pretty serious problem even vaccinating adults. Mask thee, - every politician medical quack ""AstraZeneca told European Union"" contract 2 parties, didnt announce press. werent ones said initially would disputed claim.

Im even arguing EU right anymore, arguments complete mental gymnastics That's works. Efficacy studies subtract possible previous immunity. study shows flu vaccine 50% effective, that's including pre-existing immunity recipients may had. vaccine participants hospitalized. clear effect vaccine COVID-19 cases requiring medical intervention (hospitalization, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)), reported cases among participants received Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, 28 days post-vaccination. forget 66-80% efficacy calculated relatively short period time, less two months. vaccine likely give protection time. 

Why would be?  1. Nearly every country using less effective vaccines. AZ used several countries similar effectiveness Chinese vaccines less effective. mutations happen world like South Africa Brazil brought country like have. Biden’s plan testing everyone fly (where could contracted disease yet show test. unenforced quarantine) won’t stop variants brought country. potential issue whether vaccinate people J&amp;J not.

2. Johnson &amp; Johnson prevents hospitalizations deaths. people die wait take Moderna Pfizer. Since variants brought due point #1 makes sense vaccinate everyone fast possible.

We give people booster shots later year d) Much easier produce compared RNA produced largest pharma company world. means lots doses soon.  Yes, virus multiplies home.

But it’s people go out, get infected, spend tons time close contact people homes.

But virus spreads Public.

It’s people going without abandon spreading virus house house. refer people quote specifically: ""However, Japan’s government host city Tokyo still committed hosting Games, due begin July 24, added. hosting agreement, right cancel Games belongs IOC.""

In short: Japan contractually fucked cancel games. want blame one part here, blame IOC. IOC cancel games. apparently EU though, otherwise talking otherwise contract. Honestly, really expect UK get away blocking Oxf/AZ deliveries EU (as long contractually entitled mean) time still getting vaccines EU?

I live EU (as may guessed) think right block vaccine exports reason, produced here. also see reason block vaccines going Canada example. However, another country blocks exports us, retaliate no. hard understand? eligible people waiting, yes get choice. Uptake among healthcare elderly hasn’t 70%. maybe sign droves JJ approval. Dude live basement pizza guy porch drop forever. You’re thread basically trying convince people news sucks really doesn’t. Yeah, think reasonable take J&amp;J, conjunction others, enough slowly lift restrictions time. individual basis, imagine people willing wait keep personal measures get Moderna/Pfizer. small percentage people this, may work okay. Hopefully many people think like hold else may significantly delay vaccination progress. think, AZ chance.

1. seems AZ providing delivery EU UK. BoJo trying hide vaccination numbers, right now.

2. Contradicting contract UK means nothing EU, EU contract ignore other. But... contradictory contract UK may kill AZ. efficacy 60% South African variant. talking about. Big doubt F reinfection rate nothing vaccine efficacy 60% unless HIV positive. According [this “over next 3 weeks” Stronger immune systems / diverse microbiomes due unsanitary conditions younger population current true, 1/3 people reinfected new variants, still blocked vaccines Asymptomatic covid patients still myocarditis cases. say sides, talking about? 

The UK saying anything this, AZ EU...  Yea kill idea why. works me. parent company website know I’m Yeah, impressive combination ignorance hypocrisy  Whats like asshole?.. happens 8%? According reading it, even people got it, one got sick variant. Like severe sick. got antigen test free CVS. Almost nobody got sick, half preexisting chronic conditions, none got seriously ill.

Not doctor, I'd imagine one first get sick organs damaged. something looks like boardroom totally different implementation.  way 
We idiots relatively easy Novavax make combo vaccine inoculates multiple variants SARS2, mRNA vaccine - protein subunit vaccine adjuvant. playing fast lose people's lives certainly meeting sort acceptable standard care vaccine approved children yet Nah. Unrealistic expect 0 casualties. want know Washingtonian thinks hero working front lines. Yeah, might problem... None good re: South Africa. confidence interval went far 50% due small numbers. 

Also, clinically documented reinfections, number detectable trial. 403 error link? also UK-produced (for non-US, non-India market) held EU delays potential export ban like Pfizer :) Structure helps, sure. prevents sliding even worse. voids filled normal human interaction resumes. There's wiggling it. 60% South Africa strains stopped antibodies original strain

I heard this, google agrees part dammit. Also pretty sure pharma's promised assist manufacturing Pfizer vaccine. evidence vaccine prevents symptoms infection (and spread). would unusual vaccine protect symptoms effectively also highly protective infection. margin ""able keep virus control well virtually one symptoms"" ""replicates enough person highly contagious"" small. 

Of course, issue data says prevent infection. Therefore, evidenced-back position assume - safe side. 

All good look success solely one metric (infections deaths). issue much complex that. *are* real mental health implications isolation. *are* real economic impacts drive poverty health impacts. also dealing political belief issues may behave rationally. 

COVID already terrible grey area disease: deadly *enough* something it, deadly *enough* make people afraid painful things necessary fully eliminate contain it. 

If evidence widespread asymptomatic spread post-vaccine, pull brakes. otherwise, cat already bag. Even without vaccine, least half Americans essentially returned normal. Indoor dining levels 60-70% pre-pandemic. really think message ""great, gotten vaccinated - keep quarantining"" going resonate? 

The vaccine absolutely must bright line delineates post-COVID life people. gets people excited vaccine. gives people *hope*. told - ""hey, still need quarantine getting vaccine"" - dissuades getting vaccine, even worse, makes throw hands say ""screw - I'm going take risks light end tunnel."" 

Let vaccine light end tunnel. 95% effective, likely even effective reducing hospitalization death rates. almost certainly reduces infections (and spread). 

I'd singing different tone vaccine 60-70% effective. enough bright line. probably enough protect others spread. 95% effective? Let bright line. Let people embrace return normalcy.  requires adjustment, never easy. reason can't put mask meet friends hike go beach? grab beers drink 6' apart outdoor table park? relatively safe ways see friends still maintain precautions. may ideal things like pandemic, willingness make doable adjustments unselfish means situation. easily.

Reddit representative real world.

If looked Reddit around Thanksgiving Christmas time, believe one traveling home holidays anyone COVID denier. Anecdotally, I'll tell people know travel holidays.

I would venture people ready get life back normal immediately getting vaccine (second dose, 1-2 weeks later). plenty Reddit enjoy lockdown shut-ins want life get back normal. makes hopeful, that’s sure. live NY hope come soon. NY done better job administering vaccines half states.  think pretty clearly demonstrated Conservative talking point Canada back line pernicious lie.

We'll get Health Canada approves them. That's works. Lmao exactly. Variants not, absolutely one giving another summer. took indictment people choosing relax social distancing go see family friends, that's guess what?

That's you? What? really going ignore routine trash talk people ""follow science"" ""listen experts?""

So indict you, way indict anti-maskers already made clear going listening experts this? I’d go far say it’s worth trying tho. much else done See problem you’ve given lie. idea masking, social distancing lockdowns somehow make pandemic end sooner is... perfectly frank, complete lie. anything drags longer.

And yeah say NZ AU normal would impossible anywhere else. Plus aren’t back normal all. can’t leave country! tourism industry destroyed. People living outside country can’t return. Good, appointment tomorrow! Wow, think I'd hate name illness ""Covid"", ""Viral Sepsis"" actually accomplishes that! asking EU give - already diminished - share AZ vaccine? It’s still 50 there’s lot uncertainty wide confidence intervals. We're looking yearly vaccine shots long time come. people age time never go back. missed last year annual event won’t held 2022. really sucks know missed people always see there. it? vaccines go French British, make much difference? Nobody's trying reduce total supply. assume people go location dose intended second shot. That's I'm asking. feel rounded corner? feel, personally? like sudden Biden ultimately fix saviour US. Everything promising Teachers currently getting vaccinated Illinois. are, excuses. 15,000-person trial Britain revealed two-dose vaccine efficacy rate nearly 90 percent there. small trial South Africa, efficacy rate dropped 50 percent. Almost cases scientists analyzed far caused variant, known B.1.351. data also showed many trial participants infected variant even already Covid-19 ...  results Novavax announced Thursday first occur outside laboratory, testing well vaccine worked people infected new variant. Ctrl + F ""Osterholm""

Yep, I'm gonna hit back button. said want hybrid system, means there's in-person teaching. We're seeing spike cases France anywhere much UK (and Portugal Spain), though

Especially November (when variant became dominant UK) AstraZeneca said prioritising UK first UK paid upfront facility: doesn’t work well variants it’s temporary solution Cant find source moment isnt even 4m. expected 4m. 

The 4m would expired way EU approved AZ vaccine way. Yup, parents cancelled trip expected vaccinated actually aren’t. Wishful thinking (boomers). company Seattle approved FDA sell cell Test check SARS-COV-2.

People suffered SAR-COV-1 2003 shown cells provided immunity SARS-COV-2 almost 17 years later. current cell test see people March high level means pro-lockdown people simply didn’t care friendship. art music anything else sacrificed altar self-righteousness. would want friends someone like even best times? fundamentally feel like large portion humanity simply cut good. talk best friend time, asked zoom FaceTime I'd say hell no. Depends country. Several European countries higher death rates U.S. many lower well. evidence that? word known liars hardly count. news, water wet. Wait, speaks Simplified English posh accent? that's going go down.

I think necessarily. feel like public opinion slowly shifting.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* even better hospitalizations related heavily age. vaccine access drive deaths hospitalizations heavily. comparison, healthy 28 year old real issues, I'm unlikely end severely sick. sure isn’t getting PR. absolutely fantastic news. Ourworldindata.org shows 17% population Israel already fully vaccinated virus. latest single day statistics shows 64 deaths. Imagine 17% population already protected deaths come zero population less 10 million.

It take better management minimise casualties. mean already paid it? like could get money back either. order paid something, would rather get nothing all, flawed product? Yeah, edited post. got second moderna dose last friday entirety saturday felt like slightly hungover. Random aches too, improves day goes along sunday. Everyone gonna react diffrerently though hope one ones feels nothing :) standing Brazilian super strain? real question is, getting them

Buying lots mean shit back line occurring next week? (Extra supply) Libertarian uneducated morons.  I'm worried ""the second worse"" rumors.

It ""rumor"" Healthcare worker endurance runner. spent first night second shot bathtub could get warm. achy joint two days that. 

Before 2nd shot running 8 min miles, fast still ok. 5 days shot got tread ill, ran 11 minute miles heart rate shot 95% max. resting heart rate usually 40 BPM. 

10 days shot woke broke sweat. felt great. weird. think restaurant food service employees given mandatory paid sick leave return. unsanitary imo considered public health violation let contagious people prepare food others. “trust science” concludes want!! Yeah, right, infection numbers also dropping. going get tested sniffles day? definitely end metric used re-opening things.

(I think we're saying thing) wouldn’t need test merely randomly sample sufficient cohorts. arm hurts way less last time! I’ll update original comment time goes feel side effects [But another article saying US would back normal mid wrong. stock market higher expectations following Fauci's declarations, there's slight downward adjustment, stock still upward trend long term. See [my comment days explaining likely like 35% US infected. Eh kinda. feeling still get tested every time sick, banished work 2 weeks time. don’t really see practice going away long time. would disappointed take vaccine vs effective ones. wouldn’t change economic hardship still get sick enough symptomatic quarantine. reading percentages (such Israel's seemingly low 33% protection J&amp;J's numbers), keep mind likelihood ""preventing moderate illness"" skewed fact turning death hospitalisation moderate illness failure pretty damn good success.

In words, vaccine may turn moderate illness cases asymptomatic cases simultaneously turns deaths hospitalisations moderate illness cases, refilling moderate illness bucket side.

Imagine three people: Danny 20yo, Kim 50yo, Gertrude 90yo. Danny gets cough, Kim bedridden two weeks, Gertrude dies.

Enter vaccine. Danny asymptomatic, Kim gets cough Gertrude bedridden two weeks. effective vaccine helped _everyone_. 100% success rate, right? Nope.

* Deaths prevented: 100%
* Severe outcomes prevented: 50%
* Covid cases prevented: 33%
* Mild covid cases prevented: 0%

Depending thorough manufacturer paid bot farms shit competition Reddit, could presented terrible vaccine awesome vaccine. Pfizer Moderna 80% range one shot. Pfizer often reported 50%, includes time shot actually takes effect takes effect 80%.

Honestly numbers pretty confusing apples-for-apples. ask for?

Well lot people seem believe we're trying eliminate covid entirely, avoiding post-viral syndrome justifies prolonged restrictions (Even though happen literally viral infection non-argument opinion).

Once majority at-risk/elderly vaccinated, see reason can't resume 100% normal life ditch security theatrics. wonder they're implying ""severe infections"" means ppl sought medical care bad enough admitted hospital. may sent home recover O2 tank :/ think breaking contracts reasonable? don't, think court would. would absolute chaos went court set precedent. cannot believe ""reasonable best efforts"" could possibly include breaking existing contracts. I'm terribly sorry situation, got NOTHING discussion. infected people everywhere. example would good rebuttal saying people US already vaccinated, said. US delivered doses per capita countries placed orders. That's wrong. Simple I'm symptoms, I'm recovering damage caused. mild case. Almost every single asymptomatic person chest scans recent study showed severe scarring despite ""any symptoms"".

I concede remains seen bad scarring amongst pretty much get long term. know anecdotally lots people covid positive reddit started feeling back pre-infection normal 6+ months infection. something I'd care gamble again, especially new strains. Dead people also help kill virus so... Thanks dead people! 66% chance preventing moderate severe cases COVID. summary say Phase 3 ENSEMBLE study designed evaluate efficacy safety Janssen COVID-19 vaccine candidate protecting moderate severe COVID-19, co-primary endpoints 14 days 28 days following vaccination. Among participants different geographies including infected emerging viral variant, Janssen’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate 66% effective overall preventing moderate severe COVID-19, 28 days vaccination. onset protection observed early day 14. level protection moderate severe COVID-19 infection 72% United States, 66% Latin America 57% South Africa, 28 days post-vaccination. way I've intuitively explaining J&amp;J results this: J&amp;J vaccine turns COVID something less severe flu.  people make decision every day. folks go Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins. get best medical care available them, usually hospital street.

You said choice Ferrari Kia. better comparison Honda northing all. happily accept Honda. 1. Every single day pass opportunity get vaccinated increases likelihood getting infected. decline one vaccine three months could get better one, allowed 90 days could get infection would’ve easily avoided.

2. Every month goes aren’t getting tens millions shots tens millions arms another month wasted. one person declined get vaccine waiting another, wouldn’t disaster grand scheme things. tens millions people thought way, would catastrophic. 185k today California, hopefully average go 200k day soon. Almost definitely latter. don’t want waste doses reason two total need. related article? think results reported well. reportedly 66% effective mild illness, 85% severe illness, 100% hospitalizations. sounds like major win me. sure different example Moderna vaccine said 90% efficacy ""the majority adverse events mild moderate severity"".

Once media completely butchering reporting crucial data. USA problem, able choose one want take around Autumn. luck outside US I'm afraid. mean we're getting faster everyone else. nothing people mental health issues, problem people attack others trying offer solution original commenter raises concern.

You get ways. cant attack people trying help act like get time commend people coming posting personal problems. obviously looking either sympathy help, case (and cases) help far logical choice response, sorry like his/her answer. find therapist really helped anxiety well this, certainly would attack someone thought might help well. hey, thank god white knights like coming save day. Actually, reading two sections again, agree regarding purpose. 5.4 including sites supply chain without notification.

Now, ""reasonable effort""... defined 1.9, hard time believing expected anybody signing contract also mean ""only better/earlier/sexier contract somebody else."" way ""best effort"" defined here, reasonable expectation would production resources split fairly parties similar/competing delivery goals exist.  tons those. main reason antibiotic use livestock letting cows eat grass. feed much nutrient dense food, including partly fermented corn stuff ""protein"" sources get grow muscle really fast. irritates guts causes normal bacteria infect them. ok $15 hamburgers, that's farmers need do. see. counting today tomorrow? It’s clearly enough even stock market doesn’t think is. whatever. Everyone expert. assumption strains everywhere (because are). focus getting strains control (with vaccine tweaks). Banning flights unlikely anything much may send wrong kind message. Pass. Yeah definitely world leader testing. forgot many people trying use BS narrative say we're poorly it. Oh state botching vaccine distribution pretty awfully well. fortunate enough get pfizer vaccine last month, grandparents 80 getting Monday...which first day they'd qualify. insane. Makes sense :) every country supplied once, would happen would slow rise number vaccinated place, gives virus time mutate make vaccine less effective

The issue remains vaccinate non-ultra wealthy countries. New variants occur heavily infected countries, like ALREADY HAPPENED. UK Brazil HEAVILY infected Brazil South Africa poor, YET variants made US NONETHELESS. ideal world, would enough vaccine go around vaccinate everyone quickly once

Could done production scaled countries allowed produce vaccines own, instead, corporations concerned profits. Fine, paid make patents public let us get vaccinated PANDEMIC EU single handily saving British union. Sinn Fein must cursing existence right ... EU screwed dream united Ireland (which days ago seemed like realistic prospect). That's decide, society stop moving accommodate you. vaccine 100% rate preventing hospitalization death, that's enough. Important thing keep vaccination rates average level infections. significantly help us keep heads water re: variants take steps back re: progress. disagree you. that's world works. Sorry that's upsetting you. believe it’s 65% schools nationwide still person. Majority states statewide mandated school closures. believe applies US vaccine manufacturing, requirement government Trump executive order True, again, everybody universally agrees people 65+ vaccinated ASAP. California plan specifically people younger 65. Canada kind half arsed it. seem done well places screwed other.s “While every single race ethnicity group L.A. County seen horrendous increase mortality rates, gap experiences Latinx community others frankly horrifying,” Ferrer said. Covax separate project. fund Covax also donate spare vaccines. one other. so? public numbers secret numbers? Says guy blackface! I'm sure he's trying say, Macron said privy new data added: “Today everything suggests almost ineffective 65, say 60.” contract states UK's inclusion purposes 5.4. 

5.4 general clause states allowable produce vaccines. UK's inclusion still identical regulations standards EU. clause goes state non-EU countries require direct permission EU. 

This clause include requirement AZ use UK facilities (which actually even belong AZ). think requirement, must think EU give permission AZ take vaccines India. still confused 66% number headlines comes from. sounds like vaccine either 85% 100% effective depending mean severe illness hospitalization/death? No, still can't party, that's virtuous. /s france use 65s? document obliges AstraZeneca make “best reasonable efforts” meet supply timetables, rather compelled — distinction flagged week Pascal Soriot, company’s chief executive. definition term implies commitment bigger might expected standard commercial agreement. Recommended David Allen Green spat AstraZeneca’s vaccine contract shows us commission-AstraZeneca contract says meaning term “best reasonable efforts” takes account “the urgent need vaccine end global pandemic”. points health emergency stoked “serious public health issues, restrictions personal freedoms economic impact, across world”. WTF?!!!! Jesus Christ, they're stopping vaccines going time, transparency. circumstances exports *might* blocked vaccine manufacturer willingly breaks contract EU distributing vaccines buyers sensible cannot equated EU killing Britons people nation matter. quite literally important thing functional country. individual preference causes wait, stay inside house get mRNA vaccine. Everyone else take available recommended doctor.  I'd say best bet #1 , #2 said would take long #3 really weight throw here. AZ vaccine silver bullet really terms rolling program easy transport. also AZ producing profit can't exactly threaten pull order expect AZ bothered. concern people mild cases experiencing serious sequelae (cognitive problems, lung/heart damage, etc.) months later. Maybe vaccines prevent dying hospitalization, protect long-term issues? We’ll wait see. Right - tell, studies organ dysfunction part long COVID focused hospitalized patients, reduced hospitalization cases severe long COVID cases fall well.

I still expect good percent (\~10% based know viruses) experience long-term symptoms post-viral syndrome, need make sure lumping persistent cough, fatigue, dyspnea organ dysfunction seen hospitalized patients. discount milder long COVID still debilitating! Haha say it. know redditors kind people hoarding toilet paper last year, never know! forget Novavax's protein-based approach seems work equally well compared mRNA-based vaccines. I’ve wearing gas mask p100 filters since start. think discussion threads may attract wider audience ""lay people"" checking every then, individual threads may populated people specifically browse sub Corona news.

Still they're averaging far higher cases, expect mask mandate sort. trying figure disappointing. Give credit due, delhi saved home ministry's effort. provided help blame would central government. Really? Still? Unbelievable. That’s important thing **you**. Others may feel important thing make sure protected that’s J&amp;J vaccine.  key contentions rest contract’s requirement AstraZeneca applies “best reasonable efforts” deliver vaccines. commission also points provisions suggesting UK factories part supply chain feeding EU’s vaccine programme. EU officials argue AstraZeneca giving priority UK contract Britain signed three months earlier.  legal ground uncertain Brussels’s confident statements suggest, say lawyers — especially given unique backdrop global health crisis. “The commission sounds certain — quite unprecedented circumstances,” said one lawyer expertise Belgian law. Go full buzz cut! feeling coolness head buzz refreshing! 

Edit: would help clarified could home without go out. ""It boggles mind people feel like taking \~a year social engagements end fucking world rest life get past this.""

This really responding to. makes sense blows mind cuz something really understand without experiencing yourself. makes total sense. wanted make sure saying ""damn people crazy"" versus ""damn crazy people feel way"", sounds like latter, makes sense.

Anyway yeah we're different, guess. Europe plus Anglosphere (UK plus Australia, New Zealand, Canada US). Maybe also polarizing president back rogue state taking page Trump's playbook. 

UK US blocked exports since last summer. Suddenly EU everyone arms. ""Rogue state"", Jesus, grow up. serious concern try figure often phantom ""long term effects"" actually occur long last. One news article one doctor seeing one X-ray enough make mind. frustrated anecdotes reported news without facts data around them. downvoted think part it, along tail end holiday surge course.

You don’t need herd immunity whole population, group spreading most. large number essential workers immune previous infection vaccine spread going go way down. vaccine causes immortality. NICE UK sites explicitly mentioned 5.4 production sites. 5.4 say doses delievered later date, also include inital doses. Denying exactly? Barring hardcore elements, nobody denying virus exists, threat massively exaggerated god knows purpose. Covid mild respiratory disease estimated 0.1-0.3 mortality rate among unlucky actually get seriously ill. It’s plague, stop treating Hold on, please clarify, December?

I impression UK technically still part EU January, 4 mil doses *did* go EU.  I'm living 30 minutes away Stockholm work Stockholm think disinformation claim one cares.

I'm working second largest telco we've working home since Mars last year. I've visited office twice since. 

My wife works psychiatric nurse, wear masks talking patients allowed eat lunch colleagues.

My kids going kindergarten sent home slightest possibility sick.

We cut social activities meet others outside activities.

I know plenty people listen recommendations. consider family unique. people know sacrifices. yep - thanks 'murica, ignorance astounding. important thing? Allowing us return normal. Easiest way get getting many shots arms soon possible. long vaccine good, use it. 

The longer wait perfection, worst impact every metric be. economy shot people going crazy. shrug sniffles, problem. anybody information whether previously infected persons included J&amp;J trial? think need quantify long term effects begin with. scary articles without mention often happens population. Florida woman tired Florida man getting attention. Equal rights Florida woman! That's really thing ...... vaccine set aside people want take ...... sign up. contract states AZ make best effort produce supply vaccine initial q1 delivery made EU. (this AZ falling since EU factories hitting targets)

the contract also states full delivery 300 million units produced EU (with UK included seems full delivery q1 important here) unless prior approval sort AZ EU.

Now EU factories hit target UK ones hitting targets UK orders. EU want AZ pull UK order move EU. AZ production lines vaccines already sold UK. 

basically like paying somebody produce doors sign contract say want 1 months production factory Newcastle. guys comes signs contract company produce doors Berlin. 

Your line runs fine get doors time one Berlin issues make 50% order. guy Berlin wants take doors fill order. 

shit happens time EU really focus working AZ getting plants working max capacity. dithering around late placing vaccine orders hardly surprising they've ran issues.  one getting significant amount free doses. Covax immunize around 2-3% population. reason ordered many nobody crystal ball told vaccines would actually work

They placed ordera enough doses vaccinte populations SEVERAL TIMES OVER. nothing trying anticipate future. Take look infection curves worldometer. Herd immunity definitely playing part there. commenter take someone offering suggestion help anxiety slight them?

Its funny there's two sides every argument, except one side points logical fallacy other, ""being mean"".  picturing Stephen Tyler lead singer Aerosmith head saw pic. Aerosmith guitarist's name Joe Perry somehow combine two names. Music slaps. Food slap. Also Vaccines slap. word want “effective.” eye opening see anglo centric news focus is. There's 8000 articles posted sub every time Fauci farts European leader says something, eh, couple million mexicans dying. Meh. forget CO3 :( Lol anyways stop spreading misinformation ""Madea's Anaphylactic Shock shallow pedantic."" measure epidemic control 5% positivity rate? Buy UK time receiving allotment is? Contributing fiction giving preferential non-contractual treatment UK? Trying make commercial dispute instead diplomatic one? 
At heart diplomatic dispute disguised commercial one. AZ never admit though. EU signaling UK, necessarily AZ. want avoid export bans coming government government agreement allotments that’s disguised AZ decision. company stuck middle.

The UKs position AZ allowed fulfill EU contract production UK sites. sites EU contract. Meanwhile, EU Pfizer production went UK EU reciprocal aspect government governments 

There also first come first served clause favorite British queue argument issue. Yep. end day, people need jobs salaries starve. UK paid supply chain built facilities AZ hence contract. export ban production ramps up, doses UK. facilities EU owned AZ.

We see EU thing haggled pennies. Unsurprisingly state in.

The UK received far less doses promised also, got act together faster. Well, guess us 'third states' bend wait largess actually important people deign get around time 2022, then, we? Ah religion brainwashing... sight behold. 300K dead. stipulates 'best reasonable effort' includes production doses UK. still talking?  Lol brilliant response. butcher? Many contracts say best reasonable efforts. UK one say? published yet. Maybe there's legally binding obligation deliver UK order either. state SPED classrooms back full time since September. Honestly, teachers paras like healthcare workers phase 2C. 

We opened 2A coming Monday, 75+. 2B 65+. Teachers line behind literally millions  No, none, none, yes. And?  Yes, read EU thug said that.

So what?   concern mutation variants forming evade vaccines completely. order end pandemic good, vaccine developed prevents infection. Yep uk contract says uk plants reserved uk. They’ve double crossed themselves. Yeah essential workers already point think mean ""reassure Madea fans."" may arguing semantics here, saying EU ""failed source enough vaccines"" seems imply fault, actual fact companies failing meet delivery targets previously agreed upon (for instance, Italy government threatening sue Pfizer AstraZeneca meet next deadlines).

That said, like blocs problems. UK better numbers, started early facing delivery delays (to point controversially decided delay second shots, increase number first shots).

The Russians Chinese whole different ballpark, since rely vaccines, whose safeness effectiveness pretty much debate.

Admittedly, know much US situation, since Pfizer Moderna American companies, presume higher production capacity US, facing higher political pressure there.

In conclusion, would also like point race anyway. Everyone get share vaccines, including third-world countries. let's face it: even delays stuff, Europe get relatively easily end, lot countries Africa might never able afford sufficient amount doses. . sovereign nation need give shit opinion. vaccinating Palestinians too? What’s vaccine protocol West Bank? Gaza? Israeli Arabs, equal access vaccine?

Edit: know fired bunch questions, I’m yenta, I’m curious, sorry sounds like attack. Worth noting masks recommended rush hours, seems like many people bus. put realised people entering bus, said interview that, mistake. least Trump honest open would act like petulant child needed day one vaccine purchases

Not quite true. signed order banning export December 8. Countries canada already concluded contracts pfizer stipulate manufacturing location, could USA order, canada's doses sourced EU. Well, friends assholes many drugs college also got addicted nicotine spite substance virgins college. They've ""matured"" socially conscious, ""don't offend women barely like us"" people, know, maybe care friendship crap. It’s vaccine AstraZeneca.... it’s produced low income countries Indian company. 20% order Phizer, 60-70% efficacy better nothing.  Please posts links use link shorteners/re-routers obscure true destination link.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Yes, people dumb fucks. private company obligations deliver UK, Canada, Japan, Israel put money per capita EU haggling pennies subsequently ahead butcher shop.

You're even using lines people blaming. contract states use manufacturing sites UK EU....AZ fucked mean AZ mistakes, right? Selling goods twice Literally one saying here? talking about? think real story nursing home system America sucks. failed protect elderly give old people vaccine instead people exposed day. mean think it, someone nursing home sitting room day hours living room watching tv. put NBA bubble nursing home owners couldn’t bubble homes. mother worked nursing home growing tell worse employer Yeah, think fake think masks airplanes new holocaust. They're wrong. Grow up. 92% comes comparing number people got sick vaccine number people got sick without vaccine, reasonably accurate. scrolled getting black screen yes. countries too. 

you making argument Swedens summer holidays changes mobility behavior pronounced way countries, data support that. *crickets* Source? What? scientists health authority decided everything feel bad employees EU production facilities. people have, without doubt working get production running. idea would half arsing nonsensical. They're producing vaccines countrymen union Effectively ban, right.

Dealiving delivery contracts time contract closure doesnt matter, promises within contract does. Looks like AZ sold good twice - consequences EU deliveries.. Thats challenged COVID mutations get around vaccine. huge risk vaccinating way pandemic. vaccine here. People need chill F out. Stay home, drive car outdoor places. Keep bubble vaccinated people. wait bit longer. Jesus, H. Christ. whole situation hilarious. one guy. Alone. bus. Without mask.

Suppose bus packed full people wearing masks. Would better worse? (hint: would clearly much worse)

Now might say he's setting bad example, fact he's setting ""bad example"" media making big fucking spectacle it.

International media love though. need.

This whole thing nothinburger. .04% vaccine receivers known gotten Covid compared .44% people without vaccine known gotten Covid timespan compute approximately 92% effectiveness rating. means 92% people would gotten Covid not. Since nearly everyone gets Covid, expect percentage people getting Covid vaccinated nearly high 8%. data seem able yet tell us much transmission decline people get vaccine. 
This real concern vaccines often glossed literature: brief, serious, site pain injection. There's evidence mitigated oral administration carbohydrate lozenge post-injection shockingly treatment rarely provided adults. vaccine officially licensed AstraZeneca Serum institute India..... go ahead, call knock want. Put ignorance display. answer always years post mass vaccination answer makes people upset. take years vaccinate population. also states use UK sites. UK saying reserved doses per UK contract. Bear mind UK got sent 4 million doses Eu well... EU too. EU called released. Suddenly AZ CEO quieter conciliatory. 

They called AZ preferential treatment one government. It’s likely it’s least partially case, UK said so. They’re going let AZ divert UK site doses EU, regardless EU contract. UK first all. doesn’t matter signed first first come first served contract. reality non-commercial aspect UK side play lot people trying cover that. see mobility data much Sweden shuts July. downplayers need shut up. pandemic over. We're vaccinating people. happening. end, eventually. Let vaccines job. Let policy work. biological need go Bahamas right now. plan next spring, 2022. Save money. Plan staycation. cars outdoor place, videogames online media, hobby opportunities fun bubbles especially bubbles vaccinated, fine.

Don't asshole, act like cannot wait travel smug smarter world. “News” like Americans mocked globally knowing fuck anything outside US. First western nation? don’t think US even top 3.  First come first served butchers, international contract law. even reading news? data, choosing ignore it. Antibodies 65s equivalent every age group. political move playing people's lives.  EU payed production capacity, stipulation specific factory. AZ sold goods twice OK, problem. private company contract deliver vaccines EU first. EU slow making decisions back queue trying steal vaccines private company delivering customers. 

This butcher shop. reasonable effort

Oh dear, guess it’s lawyers decide means guess layperson’s perspective closer AZ’s statement EU’s statement. It’s sad it’s reached bitter conclusion. AZ literally entire thing cost getting lambasted bullied large bloc countries. totally understand it’s frustrating deliveries delayed it’s everyone, undersold big pharma (some others - Canada) kind vitriolic approach EU frankly disgusting. least Trump honest open would act like petulant child needed day one vaccine purchases unlike fake nice veneer EU showed (whilst actually failing sign anything time, least Trump did). 

Generally feel sad humanity vaccine nationalism become quickly ingrained people, gives evidence fact given right circumstance people corralled nationalistic fervour around a) country get vaccine first b) vaccine one using almost obviously crap delighted hear bad results it. It’s shocking problem company already promised supply UK. important new supply goes Europe current supply UK maintained, otherwise might negative impacts across UK. Look definition Best Reasonable Efforts. AZ stated, absolute obligation delivered scheduled number doses. make reasonable attempt. major thing omit. contract someone deliver something fail inform good time prevent also finding alternative solutions. 
I know EU making correct calls, believe blocking exports necessarily good idea. would argue EU good reason angry AZ. 
 
I also saw there's difference interpretation 'best efforts'. AZ arguing covers entire contract, EU arguing best effort refers AZ's best effort create vaccine (which were) rest breach. assume horde lawyers argue that. Yeah true EU alone shortfall. UK also significantly behind supposed AZ vaccine deliveries. guess less issue shortfall occured emergency use authorisation. would interesting compare % shortfalls EU UK times signed contracts. possible they're similar situations EU couple months behind scaling manufacturing. 

I wholeheartedly agree efforts ensure fair deployment vaccines globally. Europeans quite frugal honest spend lot time analyzing options taking decision. Everything school project. Welcome real life ! got shit order. Unlike EU. government tried get vaccine self instead buying guns kill Israelis

Thats yikes dude. speak like true colonist, placing blame occupied, ignoring Israel blockades palestinians territories, collects withholds taxes PA, forces trade go Israel. Palestinians bigger problems virus, occupied, economically crippled slowly annexed them. Whatever contracts AZ may signed EU important contracts signed UK (much earlier).

'The EU bigger bully get way' moral argument.  problems seems AZ's contracts promises, directly EU, UK. AZ blame fallout countries.

If UK contract say 100% output UK site's production EU contract say fair share output EU+UK site's production - conflict need solved AZ. AZ cant solve EU either nice one accept shortfall go vaccine nationalistic route UK + USA taken monopolize production takes place within EU. Best efforts doesn’t mean AZ trying convince public meant. public means try best sad. course EU went insane started trying use defense. It’s also Belgium behest EU visited factory question. 

Legally means meet agreement unless unforeseen circumstance force majeure. Neither apply, production/capacity issue foreseeable. AZ surely messed big time? feel like person worth talking to? Would you? threaten trade war US unless Pfizer release stock us plants Suggestions?   
Let people risk quarantine breaches?   
Just let folk accept quickly become like rest world suffering pandemic.     
Especially increased transmissibility newer strains, don’t see responsible alternative. numbers deaths COVID-19 increase, becomes impossible comprehend them. become numb suffering. Bring humanity pandemic back focus visualization designed allow accurately perceive scope tragedy. US country fastest vaccination rate United States. Ooh, do! Thanks :) 🤣🤣🤣OK america Nah, easier point finger elsewhere. Yes, looks so. source problem. Popcorn get salty! Israel exist. excluding category western nations seems bit harsh.....

**Brexit Means Brexit.** Ah yeah, forgot Sweden best experts entire world.

The swedish exceptionslism embarrassing witness. source this? natural bit anxiety, Canada put trust Europe, rather US, makes sense given explicit policies Trump administration, EU responsible adult.

As far read it, risk is, Pfizer deliver 100% committed to, Europe, weekly basis, block deliveries outside EU.

It's great situation all, include risk, whether actually comes pass another question. However Canada done right thing, they've got biggest vaccine deal coverage  50m doses..

1. 10m doses Pfizer (ordering more)
2. 40m doses novovax
3. 50m doses Astro zeneca

All circa 90% efficacy..

We're also supply surplus pacific 🍿 🎭 Oh, turns AstraZ CEO lie contract commitment. God, CEO, would stupid lie interview knew people would read like hawk. dude fired. screws clinical trials, data contractual matters, Board confidence him. 

But let’s see reply is. 

I’m sorry EU going get vaccines produced UK. can’t see UK government allowing happen...no matter EU contract says. difficult get proper resolution. atmosphere become febrile Haredim, ultra-Orthodox collectively known, pinned yellow Star David badges jackets labeled recent police crackdowns Bnei Brak ""Kristallnacht."" Israel's government considering extending strict lockdown due end Sunday another week, politicians called doubling fines breaches social distancing regulations. say media part plot hide evidence inoculation campaign began time new Covid variant emerged UK dub shot ""vaccine death."" 😓 thanks, support ""at risk"" people getting 7.4(a) looks like could extremely important. Lucky really smart guy laid foundations this... true. 

Also, one shot regime much, much easier administrate regions lacklustre registers infrastructure. 

In regions, virus becoming serious enough warrent hospital admission also huge boon. 

It'll compete Oxford Chinese ones. enough vaccine vaccinate 80+ people, let alone 65+ think AZ preventing 100% hospitalizations well, two doses. think vaccines quite similar terms efficacy. Wait, what? variant deadly? Nobody, governments going use one cheaper easier. choice take one.  Thank you!!! relief!!! ""they"" sentence? get ears stop bleeding?

Seriously masks PPE (hairnet, goggles, hard hat, earpro) ears like one giant scab   Ever flight? instructs parents first take care helping children event emergency. source different take... Australia still vulnerable disease. ""crush"", mean longer vulnerable.   like 1920s. Thats part reason fashion extravagant decade. Going anywhere meant much people wanted look best. think decent chance repeats itself. USA worry, able choose get. want, able get Pfizer Moderna instead thing sometime summer, 400 million doses available July. Didn’t say 3 days ago pregnant women avoid it?  “Among factors” seems heavy lifting here. “Millions stabbed” never sounded good! Schools don’t require flu shots, HPV shots, etc. medical professional, didn’t even know thing. covid=the flu now? 
It’s like get vaccine. would much rather wait, continue stay home get better one live uncertainty. Also, waste everyone’s time get appointment, wait weeks it, find it’s effective one. Perhaps could even mean waste shot someone else. parents far ideal. I'm pessimistic defense mechanism. want disappointed. Easier pessimistic. Lots good things happening lately, I'm waiting shoe drop. Maybe drop I'll pleasantly surprised, I'd rather emotionally prepare absolute worst case scenario.  many friends coming going Caribbean like it’s 2019. basically vaccine good except data proof works well one dose? means use every available dose without facing uncertainties regarding efficacy.  Biden seems like would kind President that. enough data say sure MHRA EMA decided 65s protected, based data available vaccines work general. 

The U.K. vaccinating wide range people last month according AZ fist shot provides good protection 28 days. don’t long wait see correct. we'll Valentine's Day spikes weeks later hate guy, remember much Canadians thought US practically Central American third world dictatorship wanted border closures forever. 

But yes hope help northern neighbors out! need NA page. soon enough matter much. may ready larger trial May, apparently. written Asia Times, Asian news paper. let know, America Asia... someone likely get covid vaccine 2023, don’t understand either. Like protein bars aren’t best body eat lol. 

What relate people hesitant lack long term data. vaccine wasn’t tested pregnant women women trying get pregnant, don’t enough information decide get (im fertility related medical issues right soon resolved aim get pregnant right away) prior child. 

Saying “there’s evidence it’s harmful” isnt enough time life, especially there’s loads data drugs etc thought safe pregnant women cause lots problems. Okay, already established this, move now? Unless large crowd people outside, probably high risk catching virus. many times want talk today?

You also focus one thing time, appears many able to.  Agreed. happen mistake. EU stupid idea beginning. Watch, they'll start trade war we'll end vaccines all. Well that's life 2019 every year too. vaccine enough us return normal without fear COVID, we'll learn live COVID. locking forever solution. know. there's anything learned pandemic truth sometimes stranger fiction. FDA received AstraZeneca's US application 6th probably approve April.

Isn't FDA needs US trial results?  Damn even California, similar population geographically large, yet still diverse fairly dispersed nearing 200k average. bus empty big deal....

Sweden recommendations actual mandates...which foolish IMO is. one cares wouldn’t worry. “experts” used political pawns. They’ll go back golden handcuffs pretty soon. Plus, diehard hysterical side pretty much dead water past month I'll put VR set jump cliff. Best worlds.  good parent teach child ok social interaction healthy live way henceforth. wish symptomatic infection, 66% effective preventing moderate/severe cases. way consider pneumonia deep vein thrombosis moderate. 

I think say moderate average person understands ""I bed two weeks get back normal"", effing deep vein thrombosis.  what's actual clinical trial efficacy Pfizer Moderna vaccines SA variant, even UK one? know ran trials variants emerged. ""We're pretty sure work"" companies, developing new boosters anyway case doesn't. people probably focused J&amp;J a)Novavax got little attention due late party b)J&amp;J's one shot lot easy storage criteria hoping ""the one"".  discussing new strains mutating become infectious reinfectious. wouldn’t surprised becomes dominant strain instead. Despite potentially cause tens thousands deaths, South African variant sequenced researchers fewer 700 times. British variant, hand, sequenced almost 30,000 times. Nearly 80 percent South African variant sequences found South Africa another 10 percent Britain. 

It got month, it’s already make 10% sequencing UK. doesn’t sound like weak virus. sensible solution throw ideas window. everyone wants vaccine walk Walgreen's get one, give two weeks end restrictions. Trying require vaccine unintentionally creates tiered society best, authoritarian dystopia worst. happens regards az contract then? Cases began decline CA December 21st. holidays rolled around people idiots, resulting second peak cases began decline January 13th.   must rescue neighbors positioned opportunity so.  end day want hellish nightmare end starts AZ taking responsibility messing contract working resolve honour best way possible. reason continue vaccination keep vaccination rates rates new infection. seems like it'd good job keeping head water re: variants. problem certain parts country, comes bottom up, top down. No, anything international travel see boom next two years due people excited ""get out"".

This year, terms Covid-19 pandemic. I'm sure countries put restrictions place last long. Come next year, even hardened doom gloomers finally convinced nothing ""new normal"" actually normal. see return complete normalcy, see people going often. appreciation free go anywhere anything really get people about. Trudeau also announced delay part next shipment Moderna vaccine, arrives next week. said Canada receive 78% expected amount, translating 180,000 doses. 

Good grief. Canada less vaccines Nepal Bangladesh. case, believe doses provided school staff would otherwise wasted. local medical center worked deal provide access school staff ""leftover"" vaccine doses rather disposing them. 

Context - local news recall effort remove superintendent one largest school districts state three otherwise healthy public school teachers recently died COVID19. may bearing decision (speculation). feels bit disconnected reality. anything tech companies leave California go fully virtual that's alone, pushing California adopt measures forever, there's incentive that.  start delivering vaccines lower quantity? vaccinated person, risk severe illness (requiring hospitalization) essentially zero.

We gotta keep yelling rooftops. Currently battle dad well lol bad flu easily lethal illness I’m wearing mask anywhere outdoors. It’s insanity consider given evidence spreads. 

Focus indoor masking rather trying make life needlessly uncomfortable places risk minuscule.   beach weather. Everyone reason go out

But there's also covid, everyone \*should\* reason go out. :) it’s also pretty obvious lawyers people using Best Reasonable Efforts get don’t understand courts find unless demonstrate met standard. isn’t get jail free card.

It also needs read line clauses, 13.1(e) made covenant could fulfil obligations full, power EU force AZ contract manufacturers expand capacity 5.4 fail meet production within EU. subconsciously conditioned learned behavior without someone outright tell behave way.

Nobody ever taught crippling fear rejection moderate social anxiety, still trouble learning behavior upbringing. enough, anybody insists getting Pfizer Moderna instead thing able latest Autumn, likely summer. Brazilian S. African strain? 10% effective then? not. I've taken pandemic seriously, family has, want go back normal without asterrisk.  Hopefully supply demand help guys.  30-40% people SoCal Covid group includes anti-maskers high risk folks. Zoom greatest invention history! turkey fucker exclude ones never even got far phase 3 trial, like Merck Australian one. Downvote like, it’s true. can’t put role saviour/protector blocking export vaccines pandemic you’re magnanimously speculating *might* “save” us deciding share, *later*... American one? It’s German vaccine. Developed Germany funded German tax money. Biontech German company. 😉 Ow cryinge New Zealand exist? EU ones clearing vaccines. new, transmissible variants start take hold US. Boosters mRNA vaccines going extremely helpful keep variants. mRNA platform updated incredibly rapidly, basically 1-2 days. matter sequencing variant transcribing mRNA (which done routinely biochemistry). like old viral attenuation procedure could take year years perfect.  varying amounts evidence three new ""scary"" variants lethal, enough data know that. little data fuzzy. contagious variants also run risk overwhelming health system, know, increases fatality rates, make particular regional biomarker appear lethal. 

any new variant picks steam point concerning, vaccine rollout already begun. unless South Africa variant P.1 Brazil variant outcompete B.1.1.7 strain become dominant US summer, think massive roadblock terms getting lives back. real though cannot imagine top government official riding bus US. Maybe occasional subway ride New York DC it’s fastest option bus, basically treated extension welfare nearly entire country. I'm certainly eager get shots, I'm still worried could June summer I'm able receive mine (23M). Got moderna couple days ago. Injection site red Mark couple inches across feel fine.

Mom sick day getting two weeks ago. 

Dad right rain injections.

10/10 can’t wait booster. second (and also increased hygiene standards farms, factory free-range). want stop live animals shops

you'll need refrigeration. reason people put status quo cannot store raw meat longer maybe day. vendors sold packaged raw meat customers know fresh is/whether pathogens found way in. Whole lot “could” “if” Fauci acknowledged plateau cases optimistic vaccine efficacy  think reason blowing already stoppages Spain, France vaccinations, due lack supplies. plan think regulatory approval today AstraZeneca decent pile vaccines ready ship, manufactured least some, EU using everything BioNTech Moderna delivering.

Curevac still trials, J&amp;J still put approval, leaves BioNTech Moderna, producing enough current demand, given stoppages vaccination, think that's given.

Ordering early much make difference. Hopefully see enough contract work Astra promised, UK, Pfizers words, negotiated first tranche 100 million UK factories, question EU order, Astra promise. Astra promised vaccines Europe, problem, promised output Belgium factories guaranteed EU, best efforts get level, output UK factories existing commitments UK met, may wrong ordering late effect.

Of course, add spicy mix, case Astra sent vaccine UK December Belgium plant, that's going look good all, even might argue UK one using time, EU could rightfully argue bullshit.

But net result everything EU currently sitting 2% vaccination rate stopped vaccinating places good situation all, especially les incompentents UK sitting 10% going full throttle, went early lot cash insisted production country. Even serial idiot Trump same, operation Warp Speed going million day Biden helm.

Personally, mind sit restrictions 10 weeks extra, it, I'm going riot, potential lot blowback European Commission hence incredible noise coming earlier week. Can’t wait go movies Don’t let get you. It’s nothing personal towards you, everyone focused problems. friends may tough time feeling lonely too. tried reaching phone call? haven’t told friends feel can’t possibly know. think people comply latest restrictions fear. hard know happening practice compared restrictions place. I'm Vietnam, we've refused foreign tourist since March 2020, experts allowed enter country. government impose 1-month national lockdown mid March well. utter bollocks, is. statement, supposed 200 million doses (Pfizer Moderna) available end last year great financial risk pharmaceutical companies?  need speed delivery 178 million doses ... wait doses again?

Don't get wrong good almost 7% received vaccine (though whether full 2 dose set seemed questionable article).

I wonder much safety efficacy really matters can't get enough vaccine made available.   Would effect severity would two variants compete eachother , since need use receptor? millions people EU 65 need ASAP. guys American.

This you? [archive link anyone trouble accessing article fully considered that. Good points. impacted entire course people adopting safety measures.

The average person refuses wear masks someone would wearing masks Fauci said day 1. simply care. wondering numbers high UK? people even social distancing there? Wearing mask? finally able go Bahamas trip hug grandma we've cured death itself. widespread air travel, invention within last 100 years, remaining continent entire life normal. bet Australian people enjoying lives fine staying country, especially knowing poorly rest world right now. Well maybe novavax reduced little less half terms efficacy companies vaccine data came online today... moderna pfe/bnt known work well new J&amp;J vaccine also slated work well.

Article continues Another big factor that, ok, people wear mask... neck, I've seen way many people covering noses even mouth mask, mean, what's even point.  US currently number new infections also mid November last year. numbers decreasing likely great degree due current restrictions. 

Although USA faster regards vaccinations still less 10% population already vaccinated. Brazil variant really scares me, apparently it’s lethal hearing Washington Post Chris Hayes today. paperwork. employees group clinic stuck area, luckily. Even doctor sign it. whole point merely cover hospitals’ asses. don’t want overloaded. Make makeshift outdoor ICUs don’t give shit. Idk 85% population sacrifice best years shit. Nice hear. I'm 18yo Israeli pupil received first shot though high risk. possible hence vast majority elderly people already got vaccinated, govt. decided allow 16-18yo pupils teachers get vaccine could continue learning teaching (respectively). Students ages also final exams normally occure schools, therefore chosen prior 20-30yo people. blaming Dodgers COVID spike gave brief moment feeling good Angels fan. plan never ever see again?  That’s redoing anything, that’s completely separate trial required USA. claim true trial would started phase 3 results announced rather starting months earlier.

That’s actually happened rather occurred subs reality Occupation related covid. Palestinians live Israel got vaccinated, Palestinian Authority depend PA. Israel would interested vaccinating big political gains also health reasons. see Hammas saying yes? Although recognize good terms saving many lives getting Americans back normal, know controversial, find pretty unfair country poster child basically anything Covid first Western country move it. extreme measures New Zealand, Australia, South Korea, Taiwan, places took seriously reap benefit moving virus places like US. without even getting poor countries expect get mass vaccination years situation EU putting rest world making worse. I’m super stressed vaccine arm. trust info anything enough. benefit would better none face masks didn’t negative effects. lots negative effects. yep, Sweden really getting disproportionally lot attention.

Germany vs Sweden also 4.8x second wave. 1.8x, Germany pretty strict lockdown since early november. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article Wouldn’t surprised vaccine causes long term effects almost 30 knows. one promised tomorrow. Yes, example category ""my friends"". left me. Turns nobody interested all, put inconvenience.of occasionally bumping me, happen. Good them. Fuck off. Australia already crushing it, without vaccine (yet!) point getting vaccine create herd immunity. point, restrictions still place. yes, be. though. that's whole issue. getting information? US never truly locked down, Sweden certainly restrictions place.

Just months ago, college football games US hosted 10's thousands people, Sweden restriction gatherings 8 people. would probably die panic attack hospitalized surgery. also hate needles vaccine it’s worth it! telling people found new purpose life righteous figt deadly plague. care. also need it. larger outbreak previously, would far less herd immunity countries like US UK fucked up. lives risk Western countries terrible political leaders systems, shitty selfish people who’ve holidaying last year regard covid safety? It’s job clean mess. love “returning normality” doesn’t include amount casuality. no, don’t think exiting pandemic 400k less people millions facing risk long term effect “returning normality”. country less casualty like Australia New Zealand undoubtly return “normal” faster US, thousands families mourn death economic disaster.  agree. Except looking data, AZ vaccine 60-70% effective symptomatic infections, 25% effective asymptomatic infections (29 vs 40 placebo group). seems prevent infection (and thus transmission others) rather disease severity. 

So using primarily prevent transmission might work well one would hope. probably still reduce tranrsmittability bit preventing severe disease us younger people also useless. Germany says give AZ vaccines 65 created suspicion people's minds world towards it, EU wants AZ vaccines, large supplies AZ vaccines produced India feared go waste used expiry date. Tf. change nothing, herd immunity. individual probably still spread virus vaccinated. Exactly.

To put things perspective, Belgium 3x times deaths per million next-door neighbor Germany yet nobody writing daily articles Belgium's ""botched COVID response"".

Sweden worse neighbors, sure. Belgium. People single Sweden ignoring Belgium bad-faith actors. Yup, taking land. biggie. Also something note Bell’s palsy, lot times goes away! 3 relatives different vaccines. (Not covid) guess what? either got get vaccine! even risk worth it! go where? Gaza Detroit governed ISIS (well, Hammas). still probably mobility denizen Flint (and better water). Exactly

Who cares 10 50 99. helps

No need defensive. USA worst solving covid

Sweden strategy isn’t working. asking people potential solution (albeit perfect). lose? like strategy paid seeing bunch people twitter elsewhere saying booster shots South Africa variant ineffective ""original antigenic sin"". 

given know existing endemic coronaviruses, likely true. experiment showed antibodies essentially able ""keep up"" virus time. sera year x neutralize virus year x +10 sera year x +10 could neutralize virus years. indicates immune systems retained expanded memory. memory cells generally fairly adept mature, vaccine updates reinfections new variants need activate naive cells shift antibody production. (remember learning COVID huge threat *novel* virus? yeah, case we're talking mutants, reinfections, booster shots). 

vaccines work new variants. almost completely effective preventing hospitalization death. booster shots work might needed slow transmission halt protect can't vaccinated. need staved efficient vaccine rollout, good data J&amp;J shot, declines masking distancing next couple months. 

even worst case scenarios regard S.A. variant, people get vaccinated resume aspects life without incurring much personal risk all. public health restrictions might needed little longer see happens community transmission track spread variants. we're still almost there. 

the Novavax data completely freaked earlier realistically end world. even experts like Peter Hotez Eric Topol known pessimistic said news change much. booster shots developed *in case* need them, desperate measure. get vaccinated, give break twitter corporate media. sure. I’m still trying figure constitutes pre existing condition high risk. mom 62 breast cancer survivor emphysema school teacher. offered people like her? Mind bogglingly stupid.

easy way illustrate this: [cumulative excess deaths Germany medical masks recommended standard. people wear ffp2 though ? ? make definition apply made definition back point... Australia also signaled they’re closing borders 2022, regardless much country vaccinated. exactly crushing go wherever want father 67. Pfizer shot(first dose) Pharmacy sent Pfizer batch instead Moderna. 
Other pain injection site, felt fine. headache, nothing(knock wood) far. We'll see tomorrow anything shows up. symptoms really person prior confirmed covid infection. like boosting inmune system instead starting zero. 
He covid March. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article Germany started vaccinating elderly homes (with BioNtech/Pfizer) slow everything going here, least nearing completion now. went mobile teams strict planning storage issues. AZ would used mostly still mobile elderly general practices large vaccination centers. presume switch strategy start vaccinating general medical staff AZ bit earlier planned keep BioNTech/Pfizer 65+. ideal, think general strategy even change strongly. 16 sent hospital

And many New Zealand?

Closures work. governments close early responsible covid deaths. Personally, would rather analyze situation best can, without “cautious” exuberant using emotional crutch.

I think math shows likely US could weather possible increase infectiousness B117 variant taking over, CDC Short virus looked FAQ didn’t see answer this, forgive missed it. Anybody know received vaccine would cause give potentially false positive differentiate virus vaccine immunity?

Thanks!  hebrew article shows steady decline infections age groups got vaccinated first (while get vaccinated rise)

Important note graphs age groups total, got vaccinated.

you probably google translate Ok, two weeks first does? Still orders magnitude better protection nearly non-medical essential workers have. non-mRNA vaccines likely 60-70% effective though (and we'll find shortly).

They appear higher efficacy that, we'll see land. good thing vaccines production much higher. people it. correct, lot politics public relations, also problem. science based.

Science-based yes, human nature part science. And, want talk rational, one must take total utility view. Public health control measures *do* costs considered. *is* risk threshold tilts release measures. Prioritizing one sole outcome (fewer infections) may societally optimal looking aggregate utility. people can't control thing rationally situation like getting vaccine, that's education system. countries big problem entitled idiots thing want to. listening experts.

I believe unique strain American idiocy, believe countries similar issues falling American news bias. United States hardly monopoly anti-maskers COVID deniers. hard lock beginning would go public health policy border control would controlled this. Look Australia especially New Zealand. Instead half measures half measures people lack sort scientific biological knowledge deciding know what's best.

You're right, ship sailed almost year ago completely moot point discussion now. People could small social groups banded together real ways. everyone want bubble, compounding bubbles make distinction meaningless. People want eat option eat outside take out. People emotional capacity hear ""no"" allow influence others. live society, frontier. need work together, everyone blazing path want to.

You're making broad generalizations. reality people's personalities reaction COVID fall spectrum. believe COVID evil conspiracy hoax practically actively spread it. believe COVID real believe somehow right spew viruses onto people. people believe COVID real really dangerous enough pay attention want let dictate lives. people believe COVID real dangerous, forced work shared spaces pay bills. people believe COVID real dangerous, best, can't keep isolation full year - ""cheat"" see small group friends family. people believe COVID real dangerous done really good job staying safe - huge personal cost. people believe COVID real dangerous is, live life absolute fear, attack anyone everything absolutely right. 

There singular right answer this. things done better society - disappointing didn't. Simple things like wearing masks. aggressive contact tracing. gazillion things. premise complete utter self-sacrifice year feasible people - especially protect others (i.e. young people). I'm making normative statement right wrong. I'm telling feasible know anything human psychology.  Global Warming know antibodies real infection provide level protection vaccine, immune system may target common viral weaknesses across strains.

The vaccine designed body targets common viral weaknesses, effective across strains far. feel really bad young people missing best years lives due panic. consolation, expect lot partying craziness coming years compensate. could holiday surge ending, herd immunity, vaccines, weather--or numbers could fluctuate wildly without discernable reason. would due chaotic dynamics, unknown epidemiology. [Paper relevant immunity win, vaccination otherwise. meantime, spread virus kind thing safe assume nice, clear links cause effect. That's say control, virus lot room behave unexpectedly outside margins control.

I would actually expect spread unpredictable response attempts slow spread. Cram everyone room without masks math simple!

We're saving lives careful, social distancing, masks, etc. throw wrench simple models cause numbers go erratically. don’t answer you, wanted say love toaster analogy! gonna try remember later. 2 weeks dose number 2. Feeling good far.  Right around 300 days ago.  problem teachers getting vaccinated next week. That's vaccinations available. Viruses get weaker mutate...can't both. Totally agree started crying pretty intensely weekend two ago stood sink wash dishes Saturday morning, like every freaking saturday morning whole time. Every week exact same. Work, tv, call friend, sleep. weekends chores, tinker hobby, zoom friend, sleep. Maybe bike ride I'm lucky. ""Go take walk call friend, find hobby!"" Worked first six months. feels condescending AF. 

It's life, yes. people might ok that. me, monotony really worth living much longer. What's point? Work sleep toil die. joy allowed. 

People experiences make life worth living. Withiut feels hollow pointless. twice impeached reality star didn’t anything except dismantle pandemic team reduce funding science... exact opposite think people leave house work... hope let everyone get belongings left desks lol Immune system works exactly 

That tested. entire point null hypothesis cannot assume works way data back up. started working home September 2019. calls saved sanity. always appreciate client wants chat whatever we're done business. evidence that. Stop spending misinformation. idea badly wish case. Imma sound like crybaby this, I’m rising senior high school. Seeing classes 2020/2021 getting senior years absolutely shafted literally mimicking meme Ralph back bus saying “hehe, I’m danger!” want normal senior year, man. 1 - 1/22 = 0.954 95% efficacy advertised. ngl i'm autistic get this... actively avoid shops seem recognising time, totally freaks out. try avoiding people plan interact with, too, especially acquaintances. small talk same-old interactions quick smile strangers, knowing long appropriate, window time responses go fine weird, stressful know y'all find pleasing even comforting. eek.

still, seems like big deal, i'm sorry y'all suffer it. ~~and i'm sorry dread return things make y'all comforted, too.~~ son work retirement community. two doses Pfizer vaccine. 

Both us mild reactions. actually little bit sore first dose, nothing major. second dose, almost reaction. doses arm ached several days site injection. son even less reaction did. 

In organization whole, people experienced reaction second vaccine first. We’ve vaccinated 1400 people point, dozen called sick. 

Definitely much better option getting Covid!!! state also includes Canadians, Israelis, England South America more. can't understand people hard time living prisoner? year?

Please, people we're talking going since May June depending location, I've seeing drinking bars going restaurants social media barely 2 months ""lockdowns"" started.

I sympathize anyone struggling, whether fall, garbage lifestyle we're encouraged follow till vaccination, people ac selfishly give fuck acting like 6+ months. appreciate enthusiasm September. Maybe pay journalism? Thanks—could post link mega comment get around it? Much appreciated. Uh...this September. Let's keep eyes ball: Preventing serious disease goal. prevail vaccines.

What pandemic clarify reinforce notion people ascribed friend status far easily.

The truth remains simple clear. People fucking terrible, hard find tolerate around length time.

Fuck hedge clippers, take chainsaw friends list. someone notices removed submit application renew relationship. show symptoms test positive. like even 7+ days first dose immunity. incidence curves placebo vaccine groups diverged day ~11 symptoms show test positive. vaccine we're exposed day 9, symptoms test positive 5 days later likely. hear many people talk lag. sure. lot respect Osterholm actually considered applying grad school U Minnesota Public Health program. thought nutcase wants seen clairvoyant god. 

i think important recognize he's consistently negative infectious disease expert comes timelines COVID ending, surges infections, more. says there's possibility [insert worst case scenario here] mean need lose ton sleep it. even people like Topol Offit notoriously pessimistic foresee US returning normal sometime summer. 

Osterholm also realize considerable platform issue yelling worst case scenarios much considerable effect people's mental health. think anyone freaking out. trying put comments perspective. get trying funny never gets cold. sound like typical Yankee. Canada ain't much different Minnesota eastern states winter depends person. I’ve definitely nurse friends say then2nd shot gave headache, fatigue, chills really 12-24 hours. Others fine FDA actually analyzes data itself, maybe that's barrier? It’s hard rich powerful. rarely told no. sure others worst symptoms happened 16 hours later, day got shot way worse day Still would reduce numbers, point weve god daily dose amost 80 cases per 100k. know british strain heating up. already started spread. 

And mean ""almost"". still want that. waiting nothing really better. keeping spirits whole time perspective vaccination quick return normal harsh reality like ""lol nope fak u""

And made dumb challenge end christmas ""healthy lifestyle epidemic danger level drops top tier"". looked like month most. Now... much :D  Agreed. Bruh got coronavirus within days getting second shot. feel like wasted vaccine could used someone else, top feeling bad that, coronavirus. life feels like joke rn. That's good. know much supply chains maybe less difficult Pfizer/Moderna? whole thing. get crud, got point. ten minutes last tested negative good time any. Fining vaccine producer bankruptcy pandemic people scrambling vaccines would unwise idea. needs part deal get vaccinated.

How hard that?! That’s like 4 months away. change level restrictions Novavax says they're gonna couple months submit EUA, unfortunately. miss folks Duane Reade used buy too-expensive iced coffee.

And...since company, department especially, going WFH, won’t see them, probably anyone similar, again. give flying fck 85yr old know? National covid experts would stressed masks keep users safe would situation. care you? Yeah never understood recommended wearing masks. sub shy year ago many us like recommend wearing masks? people began coming ideas make them. made crappy ones paper towels first youtube videos china. patterns started showing broke old sewing machine. literally dozens masks now. 

You need doctor realize viral loads impacting it. instances reported year back doctors dying. Nurses dying. Otherwise health people getting killed it. That's talk viral load came play IIRC. front-line health workers describing dangerous new chapter struggle virus. shift came suddenly: wasn’t surge patients severity cases.

Indeed. certainly help governments (both local country-wide) sending mixed messages, namely ""stay home"" ""go travel using discounts paid tax money"". Rhetorical. Please respond. Maybe could offer vaccines soup kitchens places worship giving away free clothing.


Yeah live Canada.

Homeless shelters countries apparently horrifying places stay at

Harrassment, physical sexual assault theft unfortunately uncommon. little privacy. people understandably depressed brings emotions even non-depressed people. Also alot homeless people putting personalities (for variety reasons) people would want spend hour around, much less night. Also many drug addicted people (who emotionally mentally unstable due drugs) use homeless shelters ""dry clean"" making effort get drugs become decent socially considerate human beings again. 

Also many people work homelss leave work early night, since shelters allow people stay overnight demand person leaves shelter every morning. better stay camp RV instead camp work full time instead. That's bit bummer SA variant

Yes, means ZA variant evade vaccines. Bad omen! I'm giving definition comorbidity. like feelings. Pneumonia respiratory failure underlying conditions caused SARS-CoV-2 infection listed comorbidities CDC website. illnesses fatalities occur people aged 65+ serious health conditions already contracting covid.

That data shows. shows prominent comorbidities pneumonia respiratory failure. direct result SARS-CoV-2 infection, pre-existing. high percentage? Well, one study 4400 people showed Novavax vaccine less effective studies coming. vaccines originally tested small sample reason. read different report claiming infections still high israel Yeah knew loooong time ago, knowledge problem, problem laws enforcement. sound like want expert stuck OAN. Imagine calling someone ""fearmongerer"" COVID information page...

Canadians concerned. Canada one first country's sign contracts lot companies. held back? 

We situation provinces getting ZERO vaccines week. inoculated therefore 11 times likely

quick math time:

317/715000=0.04% infection rate vaccinated, that' numbers first line

66/248000 = 0.03% infection rate vaccinated (that's numbers Maccabi)

8250/900,000 = 0.9% infection rate unvaccinated

So that's factor 22X risk reduction number new cases per day fallen level 2.5 months ago, around Nov 10, falling steadily weeks. I'm steering worst staying hopeful. agree too. sad realize people good, kind, thoughtful smart. People’s behavior ordeal changed view humanity. messaging needs put terms appeal selfishness, succeed. I'll believe see it. Right lawmakers tied trying appease crying hedge fund managers. that's American way. least 74.2 million them. Except paused. year stolen. getting back. DONT WANT GO BACK SCHOOL   Princeton good enough source you? Probably got first dose today! I’m already excited next one!  People need stop acting like willingness self-immolate others kind virtue. parents house music festivals, bars, shops, domestic tourism, sure, guess. fault rest world total clusterfuck. ""They still don’t 100% know"" different ""Because small number gen pop vaccinated then,"" state fact (in real facts, even experts clear picture, laymen like definitely don't). idea vaccines work new strains also misinformation disproven release plenty data Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax regarding vaccines efficacies new strains. Claiming likely effective stopping severe disease \[these new\] SARS-CoV-2 \[strains\], anything \[in arena\], literally misinformation. idea trial US end? 1.8 would better true. 

People confuse general observation deadly viruses don’t spread well kind teleological idea viral evolution. Viruses evolve become transmissible, less transmissible, deadly, less deadly. 

If set mutations makes virus transmissible deadly, former outweigh latter, spread killing people. Yes aparthied state created west Dozens people day...are stuck one poorly ventilated room 25+ people 7 hours day *including mask-free lunch period*?

That's 400-600 kids per school...nowhere NEAR number kids daycare. Bad bot people live alone/ someone okay it, judge going small groups. met friends (bar one two outdoor meals buddy) since Christmas partner wants wait we're vaccinated factor would open meeting people often. they're willing risk I, whats problem? putting anybody risk will. first does, arm dead weight within hours. next day could barely open car door lol predict anything else?

Absolutely will, AEB entire last fucking year trying keep juvenile bullshit enterprise running FUCKING GLOBAL PANDEMIC.  Really though! Right money, damn. fact 
Pfizer looks like used convalescent plasma mild cases, Novavax appears used moderate cases stringent measure since higher levels antibodies Sex work essential. use PornHub dude. friend got Pfizer one *obliterated* her, decided try going shift hospital left early, following day, 

I called bullshit talk second dose bad. wrong. 

It took multiple nursing support staff roughly one bad day. quarter ran 101+ temps. drag husband bed shift day after, he's always 4am. fine next day besides sore arm chest second day slept day night nausea go in. 

So yeah, anecdotally second rough some. last long.  work? want start vaccinating group still negotiations might actually need vaccine another month two.

I'm saying state said ""we going vaccinate teachers next Friday"" without known date return school, public outraged...people rightfully pissed at-risk loved ones going work risk damn year getting jumped WFH people without known date they'd WFH. State cancelled teacher clinic result -- people really pissed teachers union threatening show clinic elderly relatives teachers could see we're taking vaccine from. people going sympathetic teachers unions probably good long time result insistence special rest public...Realize environment hand playing I'm saying.

If going believe date trust state Ohio hold clinic date, state go way trust you? New Jersey put smokers teachers. Go figure. No, speak Queen’s Unglish. dirty Ozzies speak Queen’s Eenglesh. New Zealand would like word. Plus, remember, we're blinded world trials anymore. People know real vaccine, sure thing less careful people vaccinated. I'm actually surprised headline efficacy drop more. 25 million confirmed cases. It’s likely significantly higher that. rate we're vaccinating people US, almost 200 million vaccine doses administered May 22nd. Even 2 dose requirement vaccination, means ""small number"" gen pop.

Hospitals bumping good way. actual data says wrong, people cling random article saying want hear desperately want pandemic over. Well, already tried strategy Trump 500,000 died. Let's actually try using facts instead? don’t think get enough people vaccinated get type herd immunity takes areas. hope enough vulnerable population vaccinated hospitals cope article spot on. Keeping touch closest friends family easy miss interactions acquaintances. pandemic also caused lot friendship loss. “broke up” best friend 20 years became Covid denier antimasker.

I’m confused man things going well vaccine cases dropping Osterholm talking another year this? understand reputation wrong I’m also crank know knowledgeable field... pray tell, I’m optimistic af also becoming worried mean proven side effect Covid. course, key word here, yet! sis corona nurse LA lots kids people without comorbidities showing possibly mutant strains. responsible parent send kids snot pit there's choice. Much less schools Supposedly prioritize safety even education. would sue shit school make kid come back cripple kill them. Filter worthless snark and, pretty accurate. fuckin suck certain things. life 


Saddens lost empathy others. None likely happen. 

You're right, likely, 0.0000000. Hopefully, plans include lot travel, that's began. :::crying::: No, 49.4% effective. low even shot still considered effective protecting virus, efficacy rate 49.4% among 44 Covid-19 cases South Africa, 90% cases contain troubling new variant, company annoying. Similar scenario here, people want definitive answer help making big decisions, especially comes leases. I'm also wondering this, grandmother getting second dose next week.

However super excited able see late February, havent seen since march.   level infection different countries much different political landscape. E.g. US cannot federal lockdown close interstate travel.  appear flatulent want tax breaks count vials 6 instead 5 contract wording. Surely coincidence. turned newt! SAR S-CoV-2 animal reservoir. stay. think it’s way around. real world data proving less robust happens test tube modeling. drive hard bargain, friend. accept terms look forward first shipments. sweeten deal, hand over, gallon gallon, equivalent quantity maple syrup. twisting words twisting words. says kinds things make sense designed keep people fear exactly. mom stepdad got first dose, mom already started badgering letting take four year old visit - Disney world, specifically, mind you. vaccinated yet point, risk still there, risk gets mild case brings home us, parents, mention, best case get sick still quarantine him/us two weeks I'm childcare.

Some older folks really taken personally think think want get sick/we well upset them. mom never probably never understand I've put foot visits want cause *her* getting sick. really self-centered. LOL give upvote humor handled that! need around :D
But wrong viral load. clearly played huge part covid earlier on. think believed possibly proven larger viral load leading serious cases many instances particularly thought regards people would complications severe cases otherwise (as young, healthy, etc) Many 'Mericans banding right: ""fuck you, first"" mindset general public politicians got US far. non-mRNA vaccines likely 60-70% effective though (and we'll find shortly).

And correct, lot politics public relations, also problem. science based.

If people can't control thing rationally situation like getting vaccine, that's education system. countries big problem entitled idiots thing want to. listening experts.

A hard lock beginning would go public health policy border control would controlled this. Look Australia especially New Zealand. Instead half measures half measures people lack sort scientific biological knowledge deciding know what's best.

People could small social groups banded together real ways. everyone want bubble, compounding bubbles make distinction meaningless. People want eat option eat outside take out. People emotional capacity hear ""no"" allow influence others. live society, frontier. need work together, everyone blazing path want to. Covid also linked extreme flatulence one seems willing talk about. news, far astra Zeneca restricted people ages 65 Germany..wonder happened Yeah, varies widely state, completed twice many tests state population others less half state population. South Dakota got annihilated virus they've completed 452,000 tests per million population. means numbers truly much higher. live SK South Korea western country lmao. Western Europe America like former British colonies. one South Korea sees western, set values 1000000% different. Literally nothing make western country. Yes multiple times. point, even care I'm back wish company would give us definitive answer could make long-term plans.

Since June they're giving us updates 2-3 month increments... first supposed go back full-time July. got scrapped 3 days/week starting September. Next people offices go back 5 days/month starting October open office workers remote January.

The people offices plan *did* go effect month sent back home too, ""everyone remote April back 1 week/month"" I'm hearing might announce town hall tomorrow that's changing too. \*sigh* 69% effective SA variant.  Fauci said long time ago anything 50 would acceptable. Proven where? Mars Martian population? planet ever eradicated human disease 100 years? Millions still die annually HIV it’s us 40+ years. Yeah, except countries it.. Yay something!  kinda late now. Melbourne tried took 4 months 700 cases day. We're way now, imagine long take 250k cases day tests both

&amp;#x200B;

**Antibody vs Antigen Testing become vital part response COVID-19 pandemic. addition gold standard PCR tests used detect currently infected individuals, number alternative antigen antibody tests also development. article, take look differences tests tell us. obout sinovac? get last week. Mass-vaccination change things. However, individual vaccinated doesn’t mean they’re 100% immune either catching spreading virus.

This communal effort. It’s done critical mass vaccinated. needs reinforced. right thing got vaccine, great. need make sure friends, family co-workers chance beating this.  need documentary know that! course covered up. undoable. technically course, practically politically,. better ways out. Worse US? Getting first Sunday! Hopefully. supposed get first earlier week, swamped enough staff... also wound screwing schedule turned us away....  Many already infected getting vaccinated too, helps yeah wife working school since September...The school 25% remote 75% person. Masks required school property. worked okay factor stress staff. school contact tracing cases arise, kids strictly segregated case affects people possible. 

As staff, synchronous remote in-person teaching requires planning everybody putting extra time. teachers burnt out, many saying want pursue different jobs. (Two-thirds staff saying want quit seems bad.) Almost reported current conditions affecting mental health. 

January worst ever Covid county, going go full remote likely never again. end 19-20 school year done remotely case counts positivity rates vastly lower today. Really? Biden said this. Nice! anyone care point? majority Americans moving life! Super Bowl St. Patrick's Day parades celebrations. never end. People continue go fun. people continue things? might worked March, ship sailed now. Victoria took three months borders completely sealed starting level infection 1/3 US one now. think would worthy use resources towards mass manufacturing vaccines possibly boosters variants. Tell flu, lol. shitty thing do. I'd find new job. people wrote article apparently failed see study shows believed 30% deadly well. went Wednesday got first shot US trial. said trial halfway filled far think running Pfizer trial June time frame. related passport power. Related high rate infection USA.  Yes even governors mayors beginning say this. President said able go concert ball game again. Anyone flys required take anal swab logic people reduce spread. saying that, average, person contracts causes spread more. Plenty examples spikes exponential growth. 

If near herd immunity, yes, people would mean less spread going forward think far point. 1 person statistically significant. Duh. It’s like life entirely put pause

I think disconcerting thing me. There's little conscious *passage time* even though know calendar we're almost year shutdowns now, least am. 

A bit eleven months ago walked campus last time without knowing it, still feel could go back tomorrow pick left off. feel long ago. would people, schedule, events... wouldn't. I'll never see half people again, many ones might see could already much changed. unquestionably people still think friends least cheerful acquaintances completely forgotten exist never think again, even know ones.

God, need thinking tonight. Let end soon. meant people. wedding attend. Family see. kidding. Could worse, hey, is. there's thing ""evolving vaccine resistance"" know anything biology, biochemistry virology all? Damn. remind people US refuse listen experts again? guys trained best make prediction like these. going extremely frightened see people behave getting vaccination. “I probably spend 90% time learning, 8% time making mistakes, 2% time trying get right.” - Michael Osterholm USA! USA! vaccines significantly less effective variant. scientifically proven fact. get want things go back normal, sticking head sand achieve that. Ratchet stupidity. Way go care kids get sick? Sounds like industry insider, textbook merchant someone money mind. see downvoted unless unnecessary jab American people. believe end opening gradually... things like restaurants opening first, allowing big gatherings like festivals like.

Also right covid sticking around while. countries expected even receive vaccine 2022. Colombia, example, vaccinated single person yet. make sure get covid shots like flu shots every year, nbd really.  Perfect 🤩 opinion piece don’t think makes good case given believe alter vaccines 6 weeks account variants needed. majority testing variants bioinformatics computer simulation anyway? real chance variants tested real world real people exposed might turn perhaps 'less worrisome' suggested? I'm curious see data looks like J&amp;J SA trial. mean difficult say, draw blood sera someone vaccinated directly challenge variant (s) concern? actually done confirmed without doubt via BSL3 testing, etc? think correct! LOL  guess HBO forced cancel documentary (purposely) scary headline reads, article isn’t really saying whole lot. 

“A team researchers reported January issue Alzheimer’s &amp; Dementia brain inflammation mini-strokes observed Covid-19 patients may place increased risk developing Alzheimer’s disease dementias.”

This substantial sentence article it’s still speculation. severe cases covid cause brain inflammation strokes even still hypothesis symptoms may increase risk Alzheimer’s that, hypothesis. Good. Billy bob redneck insurrection man home school wants. Might suddenly change ideology that's case, especially fuhrer picture bad. Thank you! felt mild flu symptoms first shot, get second two weeks! (Moderna) would basically guarantee us getting end spring latest. Sorry, New York-level meltdown? Headlines telling basically apocalypse worst place country.

And headlines time *ignoring* apparent worse situation New York? article describes ""nightmare scenario"" admit they're making up. reason suspect actually case reality. long vaccines remain effective, even they're marginally *less* effective new variant, there's reason continued lockdowns they've fully rolled hospitalizations remain low (not I'd describe anything exists America lockdown, another year, make it. Death would mercy point.

There great online therapy resources well crisis hotlines, I'd highly recommend them. going forever anyone else otherwise delusional. going come time tell grandchild saw eyes public. many jobs done remotely?

Someone working supermarket much choice. teacher job effectively premises. surprising see Gavin Newsom especially London Breed SF open day time did, that's sure. Sending overcrowded, underfunded, unventilated classrooms resources RESPIRATORY pandemic aint abuse? Y'all even know know smh miss shit.

Besides, I'm professional, martyr. Fortunately, every allegation, there’s denial. No, it’s literally lmao Precisely. Prevention death disability win book, even remedy isn’t absolute shield illness.  town requires masks. work essential place business. We’re animal shelter.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* surprised NZ hasn’t city lockdown eight months, national lockdown ended last April May.  Well beat us Canada, can’t even get vaccines. work hospital, they're doctors anything. Honestly, *still* try stretch long past sensible (2022 beyond), need stop complying. need put foot comes that, say “enough enough!” can’t arrest us all. friend definitely straightforward whatever going them. there's definitely potentially something else going there. spend 7-8+ hours day zoom work. Spending another second video sounds like worst possible thing world. Frankly, even work like video chat much. pretty huge reminder everything wrong life right now. friend may feel similarly. Maybe try asking directly? Got second one morning, atm dorectonite bit achy. Fear = ratings = money  lot Americans can't climb stairs without getting winded, without Covid. dunno, lady named Jennifer friended Facebook years ago forgot seems inside knowledge HUNDREDS deaths vaccine covered /s 'Crush' 400k+ dead

Hmmm rest Africa similar nations That’s also true, mention it. also read anti-lockdown protests happening Lebanon, happening *peak* infections, hospitalizations, deaths. Even governments somehow want keep sort restrictions, would simply mass non-compliance scale make virtually impossible enforce (unless they’re CCP dictatorship, they’re not.) Could? anyone explain could become super-spreader event? admit slightly one doubters, trying understand seems much confidence vaccine short amount time. hard time researching shit cause swear much awful misinformation there. Really hoping best one though, lot people around work seem anti vax fuck, yet still seem worried virus seems likely screw vaccine know, board wants bring everyone back...quote, ""It's worth risk."" idea learning going distance hyperbolic. def age access, it’s like there’s zero instruction going home. It’s certainly ideal, sub par year isn’t worst happen. didn’t spend 60 hrs lesson planning grading reason.

I'm insinuating teachers somehow lazy online, simply nature online teaching, teachers putting work getting much less out. yes, completely ineffective, especially wealthier areas know see? live suburbs Chicago district went back school, along many suburban districts far that. types districts exactly ideal probably survive, yet open. issue districts like cps EXACTLY types students get fucked lack parental pressure generally overwhelmed parents would imagine less fortunate areas multiplying problem. teachers unions taking advantage dynamic making demands, knowing overall better constituency continue online school. similar dynamic police union, constituencies far decent well-intentioned people, union designed look one constituency sometimes really fucks society like build cohorts kids need school fail allow spacing less students school

as mentioned before, would fine affluent suburban districts parents wfh monitor kids, like outlier poor special ed kids needing attention. CPS, exactly type district work, person learning allow kids make bubbles socialization one two houses, actually put funds provide home WiFi laptops. provide goddamn funding mental health help lacking since forever.

and there's much money go around, large spent. We're september land hypotheticals anymore, problems real theres much realistically alleviate besides returning person done degree distance, especially older kids. 

but entire CPS district staying closed. Even older kids, still requires motivation self-dependence personal experience high school senior. much like believe high schoolers want learn achieve, attest fact lot us don't. another thing exacerbated exactly cps types districts, older kids much less parental guidance say privileged suburban district far vulnerable. elementary schoolers, still somewhat remember kindergarten/first grade/second grade experience, simply imagine much would fuck mentally go month zoom school, much less approaching year essential jobs can’t. hell yes give vaccines money protection you’re gonna force go work too.

And again, live imperfect world limited resources, much want vaccinate every essential worker, simply cannot vaccinate healthy 40 year old 80 year old heart disease. Considering, hundred fold increase mortality someone condition, simply would prudent unconscionable vaccinate 40 year, however essential may be, someone much risk. deaths/hospitalizations minimal, I'll likely want start resuming normal life (even vaccine yet). get point barely anyone going hospital dying, COVID another disease may bed ridden short while. cancer 50 years

If manage diagnosed cancer *at age 93*, think I'll lived pretty good life, considering health issues. Eh, little concerned expedited timeline. also know back polio vaccine came didn’t know would road either. cynical is, seeing rich powerful people sides politics taking also eased mind. 1 person 100,000 allergic reaction, expect seen anything. Future tip - government paying doses. say insurance automatically billed government. Saves step Absolutely true. child medically fragile whole covid thing slightly extreme version flu season looks like us every year. We've healthy extra precautions everyone else take whenever goes doctor's visits. really hope society retains little bit extra caution disease, like sanitizing/hand washing maybe normalizing mask wearing flu season. That's good know. know much saw 49.5% started freaking (realized HIV positive people). 60% line flu vaccines that's fine me. even promising vaccine technology others could better Wut seem work well UK variant. anyone comes ""flatten curve"" fucking year lockdowns deserve everything coming them. think officials making best decisions unfortunately. [LA overrun cases yet [California lifted stay home like taking pregnancy test every day instead using birth control. I'm afraid too, think I'll believe see it. Even stringent governors already trying open schools even without vaccinations widespread us zoom anxiety would rather text chat though? find difficulty reading social cues properly video chat, know lack eye contact creeps makes freeze up. know I'm alone that, even little pronounced most. Unfortunately figures haven’t come far enough, considering people literally can’t anything except buy groceries go work. trade doesn’t feel positive last time watch news see daily death count still way thousand.  American tourists get “global stink eye”. People make living international tourism suffering. embrace American nationality comes country spend money things  Pfizer Moderna think deliver additional 170M doses end March. \*If\* that's true, means average around 19M doses per week delivered then. That's around 2.7M doses per day.  Lol based *Leadership Lessons Reality* extreme fear needles. would take vaccine 100 times see family got mine Monday. told people Covid tend worse reactions vaccine. received Moderna vaccine.

My experience sore arm starting 3-4 hours vaccine next day. 2 days vaccine upset stomach day received also exposed stomach bug might vaccine. Otherwise I'm fine. I'm 31. Maybe explain know covid long term effects, far vaccines none logically vaccine way go. Within days weeks injected vaccine longer exists, degrades body. Long term effects 'pop up' years vaccine degraded That’s obviously going happen even case it’s still 3 months now. believe US insurers required cover uninsured federal government reimburses instead. supposed charge actual client.

so happens insurance paying (because technical error, clerical error, whatever), federal government pay since they're insured, pharmacy can't charge money? apparently pharmacy gives tries find someone else easier bill. whole thing random redditors wondering studies discussions this? Hopefully going hear something too. suspected kid offered free scan research would absolutely. affordable would absolutely make sure get one. Would ever tested positive ir suspected. mom im encouraging get one blown off. yet worried long term effects 20 vaccinations life? feel like younger generation, weather living conditions. majority houses AC air-tight like USA. weather cold raining time, pretty much outside. 

The majority weddings/funerals outside least from. indoor wedding halls usually open. 

A lot people claims Indian food helping too, way verify that. 

We also eat lot fat. tons unhealthy (Diabetes, High cholesterol, &amp; High blood pressure) people grew up, many dying Covid. reasonable demand. exposed many potential carriers every day. think UK variant likely become dominant SA variant know vaccines work well one.

anyway, looks like vaccines 60% effective higher variant almost completely effective hospitalization death, still pretty good. i've freaking day too, worst case scenario probably delaying normalcy US Memorial Day August 92% well within standard deviation. Fucking depressing. get staying home PHYSICALLY hard...but shit taxing mental health. enjoy video games sitting home much next introvert MUCH Totally agree, know, market weird. true. work front desk/phone medical office stayed open pandemic. many phone calls people - patients I'm calling remind appointments schedule house calls - EXCITED someone outside home talk while, forget anything medical-related. needed human interaction, someone could vent chat with.

I've coming home sore throat nights talking much I'm used every day. Yes, high percentage (Over 85%) 60 population got least first dose (and majority 2nd dose). Even 50-59s 60% least first dose. 

So seeing hospitalizations falling cliff relatively soon. early data suggests will. something wrong.  Agreed 100% Cuomo modern Rudy Giuliani.

[Noun, verb, None likely happen. vaccines work. There’s lots things cause babies get mildly sick, partner aren’t experiencing Covid symptoms it’s probably that. It’s far likely it’s mild virus adults don’t even notice baby’s immune system trouble with. don’t panic, I’m saying. grew tail second shot

I tried explaining gf, believe me. Honestly, same. fear point come point people dying/getting admitted hospital due injuries related self harm suffering iron boot restrictions people actually needing get treatment/dying COVID itself. *has* end. first country let crush us. fitting! Cool hurry fuck Things return normal cases community low enough things return normal. fastest way everyone get vaccinated. eyes many, yes live US.

It's enforced, people follow rules regardless. means we're incredibly isolated.  plausible we'll see unsustained 2m/day next week, see sustained average 2m/day supply increases substantially. kids “huge germ carriers” comes virus. studied. 22 million 328 million

... that's first shot, people. Well yeah, house burns fastest might also first extinguished. hate goalposts constantly shifting. exhausting. talk covid elimination ridiculous

Are supposed never see friends again?

Are gonna lockdown everytime people hit ICU covid? see ""prolonging pandemic"" ""lockdown another year"" thing...

Once vaccinations roll out, available anyone wants them, hospitalizations down, there's reason lockdowns even virus still among people refuse get vaccinated. Conspiracy theorist: ""some get still infected: work"". /s chance unless supply increases significantly 16%. past week CDC shipped 8.6M doses. extra 16% planning shipping 10M doses next week. needs go 14m/week want vaccinate 2m/day. It’s going significantly easier Novavax make combo key matrix adjuvant 
They add azmuch different types antigen want
 mRNA vaccines limited much give patient without causing severe reaction vaccine likely need multiple shots instead combination shots experimental vaccine better Pfizer, J&amp;J, Astra Zeneca,NovaVax? new experimental vaccines wouldn’t possible without government funding bolsonaro bellend? people getting 60% number Pfizer came.out saying slight effect efficacy Article says 16 sent hospital dunno It’s likely one state.

Time amp vaccinations. pharma companies need join Sanofi start making approved vaccines. Pandemic disease intercepted becomes endemic disease. end. find interesting. actually enjoyed loss. always hated running people knew like this. point avoided places knew frequented. caught, felt trap social awkwardness platitudes. never realized people actually liked sought beyond social requirements.

This gave lot reflect on. Lol, imagine thinking 98 bad temperature outside. shade 98 quite lovely classes would absolutely shade (man made natural) children would sun burn otherwise. old younger friend? feeling normal (her personal “normal”)? lingering issues she’s noticed? feel like covid long haul becoming new “chronic Lyme disease” real disease gets transformed weird internet disease random people simply know particular reason test indicating anything like that. Swedes masks? second Bloomberg's. Can't vouch accuracy, interface good. Lol went week told hoping May. I’m sure hard know point. people need sign  literally watched mom get shot today. Along dozen others appointment time. guess numbers reported CDC bullshit too. read although early data saying vaccine would delayed till late April earliest, ammended. addition Sanofi resources factory would soon online highly confident meeting original time table improving dramatically.

Did incorrectly? Everyone still required wear masks stadium. It’s way entire season.  trying use beat Bolsonaro, however death rate Brazil 104 per 100,000.

Look New York State, run left-wing idol Cuomo. sent COVID patients nursing homes New York 220 deaths per 100,000 promote kind hero.

* Brazil 104/100,000 - Bolsonaro bad
* New York State 220/100,000 - Cuomo good

Where articles pointing Cuomo? number great see related transmission all. say that? Generally curious reasoning besides feel like it’s soon. I’m traveling nurse goes places take care strictly covid patients tell fact major surge right Christmas new year. right now, 0 positive people 80 person long term facility state lifting restrictions too. 

The numbers seem support tail end pandemic. scared go public lifted restrictions, go church. Idk else tell people anymore. It’s trending direction towards ending it’s time treat such.

Edit: reference, literally everyone facility covid beginning month. Staff residents. It’s also else too. can’t seem find covid contracts right sucks bc getting $$$$$$$ Yup, paltry fines seen ""the cost business"" Thanks, bummer. We're well resourced, she'll fine. sucks. Yep, CDC website accurate Bloomberg one CDC one updated, bloomberg one hasnt yet. 1-4 hours, rest time use Bloomberg. Please don’t try exposing anything guy. It’s lost cause.  seems like USA Hunger Games phase vaccination. vaccine available, lots pols talking getting us. throw bones ""essential"" workers, embezzle vaccine boutique hotels rich people, rest us left scratch other's eyes try get jab. go virus runs course leaves undertakers rich population exhausted complain. always. Hopefully already planning project done end summer? 260 million people (the eligible number, saw somewhere -- know maybe, counting children?) 520 million doses. rate 1.5 million day that's shy year finish. 2.7 million day brings seven months. (If take away 26 million total doses already given, around 6.5 months).

Edit: Whoops! considered new vaccines single shot vaccines equation. would nice too. cannot give enough upvotes. Suppression offers clear end point. Zero covid pursuit gives clear goal. may one that’s virtually impossible hey, it’s fun write don’t actually make decision giddy time spotlight. Yeah us made sacrifice seeing family Christmas, got max 10 minutes opening presents that's masked, guess happen us... wife anaphylactic reaction Moderna vaccine. caught immediately, thank God. woke periorbital edema progressed throughout day. got week prednisone, benadryl, famotidine. sensationalist fuck worst, constantly trying get headlines!  Here's Nobel Prize medicine. 🏅 7%? hope pick pace... mRNA vaccines trailed India too. But, govt really interested Pfizer Moderna high demand extreme cold storage requirements. working fast track Bharat biotech AZ/SI vaccine work normal freezing temperature cost less. would explain 2020 elections. vote orange twice? think people would agree people refusing vaccine forgo right protected everyone else Yes, except ""reasonably safe"" data coming from:

1) classrooms CDC guidelines followed (low capacity classrooms 6 feet distancing, masks always, good ventilation)

2) school districts inconsistent testing policies (asymptomatic mildly symptomatic children whose symptoms disappear within days unlikely tested all—even family member tests positive.)

Teachers resisting returning in-person learning either highly skeptical district's ability ensure CDC guidelines followed skeptical data says schools ""reasonably safe."" CDC said person education safe *so long measures limit community spread place*. aren’t taking measures, article irrelevant.  data efficacy Oxford vaccine S.A. variant? Asking South African first phase vaccines (for still waiting) Oxford. results public distrust. people tell someone else thinks they're stupid. Might take couple days analyze new strain interacts body identify protein/antigen target, plug computer prints vaccine. Supposedly took 2 days first time. get rid Newsom already. 10 months+ plan areas shut. lack urgency planning unforgivable fair, reason isolate/quarantine hotels selfish dickheads, coming home started, staying home going shops spreading around. Yeah baby Western = rich Democracy. consider Japan Western country definition. Vaccines allow people resume normal lives. lie it’s emphasized enough. yet, lot schools still open. Yay, AZ! hardly anyone dying it, obvious. Feels pretty normal me. People going come grips goal avoiding covid altogether. It’s ending hospital.  vaccines get done that’s mission accomplished. Next round variants whatever else needs resolved. Well, course, mean really close now, least compared year ago clue going play out. Nobody's suggesting going last forever.

I'm saying right now, vaccines, we're rolling out, certain group people already immunity virus time either vaccine virus itself. remember last year people speculating vaccines could even made Covid. We've made long way since that's mean light end tunnel. We're incredibly close getting back normal, opposed state things last year. seen 400mil yet... entire Africa. Billions people. worry becomes normalized beyond reasonable. 

I.e. ""yeah sure cases single digits 2025, takes one slip up. Keep wearing mask everywhere social distancing."" *but rather approved later.*

And stopped copy-pasting FDA's approvals back early December? Like, law physics stopped them? answer none, they're idiots. That's lie Pfizer already come.out said SA variant slight effect vaccine sorry different thread Israel study quote saying vaccinated people got ""very light reactions""

Probably referencing Maccabi study nobody vaccinated hospitalized 

my mistake. lying incorrect. still bad logic - since cases currently decreasing - could say cases since steadily decreasing since last March.

Last March occurred today. 

The problem you’re accounting peaks valleys between.

Also - decreasing isn’t necessarily great thing they’re decreasing dangerously high rates previously. It’s likely improvement really bad bad many states.

Decreasing isn’t metric measured. Mmmmm Australia?? New Zealand?? don’t half million dead Well given amount people flat refuse vaccine may never. hypothesize could go one many different ways, think probably post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Lol, full bs, ppl like wear masks wash hands. Good luck Can’t wait somebody blame spreading Brazil, UK, Los Angeles variant simultaneously. reached (most recent) peak week ago. would consistent major spike Xmas/New Years. critical mass vaccinated

not saying disagree you, provided clear point ""when ends"" opinion  Unfortunately doesn’t reduce risk contracting covid get milder symptoms get great don’t think many people really done enough research people think keeps getting it. It’s don’t understand that, do. don’t understand it’s hard keep wearing mask that’s doctors scientists recommend order keep safe They’re tough spot. spent millions probably planned millions ROI.  Let’s act like dithering around bag M&amp;M’s. It’s outright dismissal anything doesn’t involve avoiding covid really prevents lot people getting board. Life complex. Look can't help countries like US holding global mean world travel. can't put vaccines spiders infest 

Man up. Trini screwed you. US cannot sane sense claim number one Sure, I'm worried even prevent severe disease, narrative going shift ""preventing spread."" Possibly “since New Year”. 

Since January 21. 

You’re accounting weeks between. Gimme vaccine favor cutting much beard comfortable time. terms proper masking. know men love keep face fur good cause. may thank one day. LOL b.s.

I'm guessing comprehend wrote, absurd


As sunset, need sunset? X things met, necessarily safe adjust there. mean, seriously telling ICU completely filled brim, rolled past arbitrary date open everything back up?

Obviously cases would dropping they’d peaked places two weeks New Year.

I’d expect cases sharply rise two weeks Super Bowl. What’s london? dude brazilian president bolsonaro said vaccines turn people alligators, way USA worse   headline conveys useful information, number means absolutely nothing without basis comparison. many unvaccinated Israelis caught COVID? get it, little bit bright side- company ends deciding pull this, businesses things like restaurants would likely safe open. don’t data it. Several drugs thought safe pregnant women caused birth defects problems, really knew....

I actually supposed one vaccine trials screen failed due choice birth control (barrier methods). surprised me, started medical issues got really really scared everything could affect fertility. Never doubted message would doubled on. doubting people could fit bed F-150 going it. appreciate response, would argue distance learning failing students, especially vulnerable. kinda problems, eh? hard recognize people want expected wear face mask public rest lives? absolutely governments job make digestible want compliance anything requires restricting human rights. many states trying intrude family affairs, ability travel. human rights defined 1948 convention. want people comply ignore you, duty explain. That's ""experts"" complaining entire time right?

This scientific requirement, ethical one, public health;its bioethics. Nah people work gotten intense diarrhea vomiting full body fatigue horrible aches pains Statistically flu riskier, death wise. Children group that’s case. whole long term effect thing another topic hypothetical new strain coronavirus, would completely change entire structure amongst things. I’m aware things god bless! Pretty sure older people actually better vaccines reason. Would love see study assume you’re younger you’ll worse getting shots. feel like people saying actually worn masks this, least worn properly. I'm going doubling regularly family members live with, off-chance wear two masks past, breathe fine. percent administered low issues reporting. actual percentage higher, hard gauge much truly is. Reporting complicated lot states. Technically, healthcare providers supposed report doses administered within 72 hours, many manual data entry and/or reporting right way, even all. phase 1, providers vaccinating staff, well staff locations. recipients EHR administration facility patients, hence need manual data entry. start vaccinate gen pop, delays challenges reporting continue get worked out.

[SD county vaccine locations Reddit LOVES teachers nobody allowed criticize them. get it. CDC said reasonably safe teachers go back work. site claims following science says, think would enough say ""ok teachers, time go back work even 99% safe 100%, person learning much effective school-age children distance learning, especially vulnerable kids society.""

So I, one, think reasonable demand.  think you’re referring phase we’re right now, pandemic. Considering there’s thing zombies thing widespread viral disease, we’re zombie phase now. vaccine end movie.  worried. EU shown barely get way. hear? Brexit means left continent Europe  Stay mad lmao Moderna work booster shot South African variant right now. said would third injection first 2 regular covid, already effective UK variant well (and think Brazilian variant, fact check me).  Would consider adequate look states similar plans place see kids staff still getting sick? seriously don’t get people look deadliest month far like, “Yeah, looks like good time put hundreds people back building.” articles saying schools don’t contribute superspreader events leaving fact may superspreader, kids teachers get sick, take home whoever live with. It’s bunch people saying willing trade lives community members reopen schools. Gamestonk people died vaccine? agree shitty replacement, kindergartner . . . kindergarten. said, online platforms really good. already exist, implementation depends resourced district pandemic. Covid 2020 gamestonk hype free men nation could become citizen. Shoot want one those!  that’s elimination country vaccinated countries like Australia New Zeland solid plan crazy. Wow people sub insane. kidding? Everything delivered? Goddamn. Awesome work. Thank you. Forced take it? \*Laughs Western Australian\* 
We enjoying completely normal life months now. barely even thing here.

If return normalcy metric, Western Australia ""crushed"" long time ago. Yep teachers getting vax starting week, schools hopefully open hybrid after. reasonable. want schools open, vaccinating teachers first totally reasonable. logic class man, change anything. definitely know vaccine way NYT known articles like thought kids couldn’t get vaccine.  Serious question: could dip cases wintertime ""not going anywhere cold""? gets warmer people want go places climbs back up? amount reinfections people whove already gotten covid get resurge makes think we're quite woods yet, especially variants keep popping circulating That's border control, mate. know, sort thing could saved whole world ton misery we'd locked China start. Weve proper lockdown since march. scary threat. GDP isn’t good method comparison. one, US doesn’t get nearly return dollar spent vs Israel due much better education Israel.  told get free. ignore that? say fancy masks like N95 KN47 ones, actually wear either blue surgical mask cloth one (and I'll probably doubling on). I'm talking masks, could even double two regular surgical blue masks (or even one would help) makes difference.

Don't assume things definitely assume care less people. honestly think would stay whenever possible year care people, family, strangers too? live family members worry death would end catching virus going bad path, them, me, them, continue we're vaccinated cases enough able return normal life. tell idea real life works know virus real know could happen catch know people feel way friends families do, I'm them, well. guess disagree whether safety plan adequate. teacher's union says something make true. Whatt dont? miss !! neighbors vaccine, one moderna, one Pfizer, side effects all. number reported today, number positives today’s tests.

Higher case numbers usually reported later week report specimen results heavy testing days (Monday, Tuesday)

In MA, cases ~30% 3 weeks ago dropping. agree. entire profession teaching exists professional class educators deemed effective teaching kids parents. blaming poor, single mother resources and/or ability teach child effectively professional teachers do?

Now listen, agree 100% terrible job educating parents good parenting skills. one bizarre public policy failures leads huge gap parenting skills different demographics. mean say teachers' responsibility come work every day in-person, effective, schools done reasonable job putting covid protections place. believe schools done, yet unions still fighting person learning. OK, so. next time make argument pay/benefits negotiation sacrifice much kids, argument going ring hollow me. Where

This comment response new San Diego station. app sucks reason replies go. downvoted?

Things becoming suspicous sub Australia larger Vietnam confirmed  Lol,  said like one stupid week never hear end it

Yeah, going hear end it, monumentally stupid thing announce impacted entire course people adopting safety measures. They’re lazy don’t want work respect them. I’m tired people sub think people wanting live lives selfish thoughts whether implies vaccinated individuals pass COVID others? fuck Cuomo win Emmy, joke Holy shit past year wierd completely forgot issue. admittedly poor buy good mask relied never leaving house...now I’m looking better ones still barely leaving house lol Lol, common dude you’re better this, ad hominem literally argument, logical fallacy... Correct. legal travel anywhere want - still pay gas, free. /s Nope people lying like seeing friends. exhausting?? amazing living NZ. get live normal lives slightly less tourist.  Also considering many times heard “rounding corner” “two weeks quarantine” much better public low expectations preps cautious summer. merrier Why? I’m protected continue care? I’m going protect people refuse get vaccinated. time get everyone chance I’m low risk gets. Many experts assume capturing 30-40% real infected rates. weeks ago, estimating 60 million infected people US. knows number now.

LOL know many people try believe US's number better yet situation better EU finnagling number. Europe part least functioning government trying proper pandemic response unlike US's federal gov't response, experts believe catastrophe. Literally says 715k people article Take care first. almost year. kind idiot would throw super bowl party probably already got infected point. claustrophobic beginning, one mask gave anxiety attacks made panicky. y’know what? sucked got used it, I’m double-masking 8 hours day work, 40 hours week, it’s big deal all. don’t nothing. much better nothing. able actually get hands better masks, should. stop bitchen us going super spreader get people vaccinations spikes better attaching ACE2 receptors aka lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, intestines. Better masks block inhalation airborne viruses. need KF94/95 respirator P95/P100 filters 95-100% efficiency. Otherwise, it’s gamble every time go somewhere tbh.

Though still wash hands could still touch something touch mask blocked virus infection. 

Stay safe! I'm new Reddit really care anymore. think need take break shit. nursing mothers vaccine? UK variant seems contagious amongst children. studied. (late 20s) received first dose Pfizer two weeks ago several older family members received Moderna. sore arm less 2 days fatigued 2 hours receiving shot. that, felt fine. I’m also new mom fatigues likely exacerbated near constant state sleep deprivation due 2 month old. family members mentioned sore arms, tiredness, headaches day after. Teachers signed teach kids, sacrificed altar reopening inadequate safety plan. Sadly, seems likely. they'll help herd immunity unfortunate way.  mean that’s sort risk accrued country completely shuts borders another? AUS didn’t succeed lockdown objective negatives closing world clear start low natural immunity relations Yeah relatives “won’t get shot already covid”.... I’ll believe literally see it. Also see people”pretending” so..... yeah Based study, 100% true.

Since study’s numbers really useful, doesn’t mean much. still, study found exactly out. UK supplied plants Europe debate began.

Yes, stipulated contract AZ return higher prices wonder base morals on.

This moral question. Either take vaccines UK people die, EU wait people die. Given EU screwed up, UK; people EU die. Sorry.

Morally wash, either way, people anything, company screwed parties signing contracts could fulfil. 

The contract signed contains best effort clause, cancel refund money EU sell vaccine elsewhere. would pretty stupid UK try cooperate here. FAR weaker party, too.

&amp;#x200B;

So think UK government voluntarily allow citizens die fix EU's fuck up, vaccines british people already paid for? saying kill citizens EU retaliate them? No... wonder morals based on. *laughs herd immunity* Yup lol. heard mentioned recently was, fact, virulent variant original Covid virus hit Italy, eventually hit America, course way vaccines available. 

&amp;#x200B;

Btw, read N95 masks best masks one get protect one Coronavirus. Yesterday bought 5 think great mask protect variants become dominant US? page, says:

&amp;#x200B;

""In study published the American Chemical Society, researchers University Chicago tested filtration efficiencies common fabrics, including cotton, silk, polyester-spandex chiffon. scientists found masks made combination fabrics, high thread count cotton two layers chiffon, nearly effective N95 medical-grade mask, filtering 80% 99% particles tested."" Chinese-made ones even cheaper. comfort, silicone rubber quality, certification may consider ""seal better, thicker filter surigcal cloth masks, filter least worse"", price 5 disposable N95. Perhaps handing first line responders OK mass adoption. Arguing quality moot anyway since, example, Australia, national stockpile buying KN95s hand actual first line responders. Hm, bad flu though. Flu multiple strands rna (kind chromosomes people), get two variants flu, end multiple combinations both.

Coronaviruses one long strand, likely mix&amp;match. Fortunately, orherwise we’d fucked. I'm sorry hear this. I've lucky friends sensible obeying rules feels lot like ""we're together"". Makes lot easier swallow I'm confused. efficacy SA variant 50% 60%? Still doesn’t mean EU fucked anything. 
I think UK fucked WAY giving elderly vaccine hasn’t tested them. Absolutely ridiculous IMHO criminal. 

We already way many anti-vaccine people proof point. Well they’ve said won’t export Oxford vaccine. isn’t much threat continuation thing they’ve already started.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* ultimately, mean one give up? way starting sound, AZ UK production plants stated EU contract part production chain, plus actual delivery dates. case, current reduction count fairly EU UK. suddenly give 40 million doses course. fair, EU 'stealing' UK doses, one pharmaceutical company treating customers fairly. Nobody expecting doses conjured thin air -although would appreciated course- fair treatment.

You can't say ""oh yeah breached contract, anyway doses now, let's forget move on"". 16,5% received second doses. supposed take 10 days full effect.  Nobody's upset it. Germany's decision correct, MHRA's decision approve use 65s. positions valid based available data. matter either way really. Even AZ wrong best effort clause say does, still get doses EU faster still bought paid UK, AZ's contract UK crystal clear. UK paid higher price ensure AZ deliver 100% order first. 1. Logic common sense.
2. government source directly quoted.
3. will, hence user's comment

If user directly mentioned 8% story, would agreed ""anti-vaxx"" was? UK supplied plants Europe debate began. wonder base morals on. 

Beyond that, UK already vaccinated vulnerable far ahead Europe. moral ally commit sharing success? 

If anything, company screwed parties signing contracts could fulfil. 

It would pretty stupid UK try cooperate here. FAR weaker party, too. always thought introvert, would take chance stay home chill. last year, can't stand home more. wanna burn down. That's higher education small handful go there. look PISA results 2018 (international assessment 15 year old student reading, science math skills) see Israel well OECD average way Lockdown measures suppress deaths...temporarily. Fewer accidents, fewer bar fights, etc, etc. UK made single threat Yes know it’s safe, saying don’t know efficacy provides 65s, due lack data provided, recommended used categories nothing discuss, UK rights shipments well. one reasons UK paid much higher cost per dose EU. 

 EU fucked up, backed wrong company, wasted BILLIONS euros, wasted months time, catching them. Honestly, pound sand. 

If Germany France, would livid absolute pigs ear EU made this. Perhaps time Fraxit Germxit? Yep personal view think Germany’s decision cautious sensible approach given data provided. know cause lot upset worry people UK, important stress decision made scientific vaccination board, politicians. Same!!! like soon population started get vaccinated, suddenly everyone stopped wearing masks? existed long covid-19 did. go back that. data **safety** vaccine, low risk vaccinate hope provides immunity, much like UK doing. republican? usually see kind strawman bad faith garbage side. lives matter (in covid sense), we're prioritizing old people many magnitudes higher risk like 30 year old working mcdonalds. knew prevented spread, would argument, almost silver bullet death, would disgraceful give 30 year old teacher 85 year old heart condition. Someone get vaccine first, giving people highest risk monumentally stupid California can’t even find phase you’re work research lab. medical/Clinical lab. Research stage lab. Fuck CA EU Spanish (Unión Europea). bad. 1. know, person say that

2. Fox news isnt America. blame country sensationalist headlines

3. Hard find secret source trustworthy Well, AZ since completely given seems, contract public today. We'll see.  competition 

It competition, particularly good one, really be. unfortunately, one. Mild loose stools, 3 4. Nothing like ""I go right now"" anything. Loss appetite. mild nausea. like said, exposed stomach bug day, I'm home health nurse child take care sick, sibling got sick partway day, mom sick next day. absolutely ""Morally right"". UK's first obligation British people, EU. made deals, paid money, signed contracts exactly that. 

Now sudden EU screws somehow morally wrong UK keep vaccine paid (paid much higher price EU exclusive domestic production delivery well might add), UK screw thier people national health system EU ""going make things worse them"". 

I think so. said month utter lie. known years important masks are. open ears tolerate pointed non stop.

Because cost thousands lives. knowingly. also undermined trust 100x. cost future lives.

Documentaries made 20 years it.

You absolute gobshite. sides making threats EU’s threat one would stop British people able second dose. UK seems fairly confident EU’s humanity let happen think it’s quite arrogant thing gamble with.

FTFY  everyone tHiNk aNd... youtube research. Also, remember listening MyPillow guy task force briefing WH May???? remember! feeling wait 4 years? Can't now? UE? regular cup I'm saying Germany's decision wrong. I'm saying headlines threw fuel anti-vaxxer fires completely false claim. threads tend much lower tolerance unnecessary scare-mongering, posters individual threads seem that. 

also, N95/KN95 definitely better cloth-over-surgical combo media drastically over-selling extent they're short supply. bad advice. flaw whole preexisting condition part. see pointing rarities makes case us hand vaccines essential workers young healthy willy nilly. highly doubt tbh. We're producing AZ vaccine locally (Estimated 1 million doses/week time March), we've actually ordered two vaccines addition (the total order something like 140 million doses IIRC). Everything Sweden’s response keeping economy moving. bog science. (Reuters) - artistic swimming Olympic qualification event due held Tokyo March postponed May novel coronavirus restrictions Japan, organisers said 2020 organisers swimming’s world governing body FINA said qualifier, also doubles test event summer’s Tokyo Games, would take place May 1-4 instead.

...

Article continues Remember killing millions minks Denmark? That's virus mutation, Germany. Today probably see contract. Unless AZ offers something acceptable UE. interesting AZ started negotiating UE stated would release contract... hope actually publish contract today, announced. People Germany mad European Commission well, much AZ, UK anybody else. EU already threatening cut exports. new powers allow block export supplier shortfall commitments EU. Pfizer shortfall read expected make end February. potentially several weeks blocked exports already cards.

Besides, UK already received huge amount Pfizer order. producing 2m doses week internally AZ vaccine. receive Moderna via Switzerland, Novavax produced domestically. Also J&amp;J via EU UK's deliveries scheduled EU's, can't claim shortfall block it. open new facility capable producing 15m doses month: UK fine. like Atlantic. nice publication seems unbiased, also free coverage Coronavirus articles quite nice too.

Looking Guardian. Presumably date ""2021"" well.

This seems mink mutation last fall, caveat seemed gone nowhere Germany. Here, though, talking possible immune escape distribution far Bavaria. patient died, already receiving outpatient care care home, clear whether died Covid even infected period. failed source enough vaccines. [AstraZeneca Pfizer failing deliver supplies we've already paid Thanks mate! Currently, Israel runs 50k-100k tests day large amount UK’s (and indeed countries) deaths people would died year anyway, died Covid cancer had. Many people not.

Happy cake day! Yes well Bild hardly reputable it’s like sun. Idk Handelsblatt don’t know figures from. think germany sensible cautious here. Yeah, sounds bit dim. looking similar contract expert mind... better ""expert"" opinion offered here. Watching rest world WA quite surreal. choose better place restricted to.

All praise God-Emperor McGowan Clive Palmer eat bag dog turds. Come join us r/Covidtrial! think understands meaning ""third world country""  Yeah, counting Level 3. ended September IIRC. Level 2 annoying dire. 

Hurts capacity stuff.   daily threads laughing double mask posts individual threads talking smart idea is? Feels like weird disconnect.  *if know Sweden*.. know countries summer holidays?? would able work day dose 2 long article lots conjecture... without looking actual contract. know, right? no, US ALWAYS FIRST.  Danish mutation? new? yes cuz players sitting around asses 3 months put quality product. /s. Clearly know anything abt football. Anyway, consenting adults, gonna overwhelm health care system, point whatever. think they're referring headlines Handelsbatt Bild.  heart rate shot resting gradually went higher usual working out? shouldn’t shocking. bad cases be. restrictions UK US done nothing, death rates even higher country intentionally done little. He's going full herd immunity leading example. would still worry anti-vaxxers. They’re much risk they’re huge risk immunocompromised people public. find train people administer them. LA County months prepare moment.

Another way consider numbers:

A typical Dodger game 40,000 fans get stadium within 90-minute span. includes going metal detectors getting tickets scanned.

40000 fans/90 minutes = 444 fans processed per minute.

Meanwhile, regards shots: 7700 shots/15 hours. 7 shots per minute. 

Vaccine administration 65 times (roughly 444 divided 7) complex getting fans baseball game. 65 times slower however. problem :) end agreement messaging absolute disaster I'll leave readers chase many many why's haha. Thats also correct. gett vaccine distrubutiion must abide restrictions mean mask restrictions would probably gone major North American cities, malls, businesses May 2021? Sorry article seems... I'm sure word use here? US sorts issues right now, distribution actual vaccinations happening, losing doses disappeared and/or went bad getting destinations. Also, supply issue. now, Pfizer Moderna saying think make enough, they're pretty sure, proof pudding yet ramp production level needed - one talking revamping vaccine cover new, contagious variants, takes couple weeks - so...

Also, last checked UK, Aus, NZ... western nations. anymore. South Africa strain game changer According EU, advance purchase agreement say delivery dependent single site. actually explicitly mentions U.K. locations locations fulfill supply. Meanwhile AstraZeneca restricting supply EU based Belgian location. Cooperation two sided.

The best efforts defense going work legally AstraZeneca either. Although people seem think means said try didn’t promise, that’s case. legally required fulfill contract unless unforeseen issue force majeure event. Normal production factory issues don’t work it’s EU/Belgians plant. 

There nationalism sides here. It’s naive think otherwise. AstraZeneca prioritizing UK despite contract Eu using UK sites UK also meant supply EU. contract language, doesn’t matter UK signed first. real issue AstraZeneca isn’t delivering agreed on. Approval also doesn’t matter since eu whatever want vaccines. 

EU said difference Pfizer transparent explained issues having. Also schedule. sounds awfully like Pfizer showed issues fell within contract language. think it'll donezo May? I'm hoping anime conventions (like ACEN) back late May haha Lol don’t tell man you’re aggressive shit stop spreading misinformation stop messaging thanks. got Moderna andyeah, sore arm slight fever got mine later evening able go bed sleep that.

Felt little ""blah"" next day noon lunch arm. Haha all. guess I'm arguing that's teachers fault. could done well. Instead DeVos may well named DeVille appointed. Pretty normal Australia. largest worldwide sporting event (Almost 50k people) pandemic 0 cases coming it. Besides NZ, western country capable record? isn’t* Proud MURRICA likely. utterly failed vaccine distribution efforts. rate, won’t even whole first world vaccinated end 2021, let alone even put dent vaccinations across rest world.  isn’t lot people never face terrifying medical procedure exchange normal life. I've got treacher collins childhood full moments like that. understand fear, really do, we'll better vaccinated. company's meeting contractual agreement, problem export. take away fact extremely greedy US been, fact. US developed nations, yes.

The pandemic always us. either get vaccine get virus.

 severity impacts 90-95% within 2-3 months developed world due vaccination. 95-99% 2022. Death totals 2021-2022 covid season inline flu.

 easy target high risk populations. Already 50% people life 70 vaccinated. ETA 1-2 months everyone 65 vaccinated US. kid then... fucks sake people need learn responsibility actions like kids consequences.

Now agree wages poverty massive issue US huge impediment able raise kids. Nonetheless given shitty situation gotta realize kids means sacrificing. well means even sacrifice. that's price. I'd love weren't. is. depends mean ""over"". 

If mean first world countries, restrictions, deaths way down, hospitals longer risk overwhelmed, happen late spring (in US / UK) maybe little later (in EU).

If mean case everywhere world, bit harder predict, likely 2021.

If mean covid cease exist, never happen. think time window “intercept” disease prevent becoming endemic passed? still living April last year?

Because covid managed finagle it’s way every buttcrack country already. It’s every county every city every street. numbers showing decrease infections. lift restrictions.

Like dude know don’t like sound that’s truth that’s what’s literally happening. kick scream want early lift restrictions. doesn’t matter it’s still happening. scared, stay home go church. nothing tell doomsayers anymore. got first dose last friday. Next 12th. Australia starts vaccination February too, 50 million vaccines order, 25 million agree you, ppl questioning validity title post think there’s enough information know would well new variant. I’m saying won’t, know, 10% could’ve new variant 1% could’ve old. Dutchman bid hearty *****

That's friendly version. bother Internet real version.

Bye got anti-vaxxer. go piss off! want roll dice see one ones massively affect? Doubt it. TLDR:
We die  Following restrictions isnt going stop covid...

The thing vaccinate people, that's beat this. Well Trump president ever find viable solution this? looked OD, seems deleted. are. daycare. know reality teacher family. kids straight even connect zoom days. parents home heat yelling sometimes. ignore kids completely. kids connect. parents home? idea, hear them.

Point daycare parents go run lot kids suffering educationally parents seem think school anything child raising service.

Are people suffering? Absolutely.  among 20 officially listed somewhere assume anaphylaxis prevalent reported?

I ask I've seen multiple people make statement regarding someone anaphylaxis, number reported people reaction literally 30 US last saw. Amazing results

It's less 50% effective SA strain consider HIV positive (6% total numbers) 60% effective SA strain. Company talked boosting serum SA strain.

It's effective British strain, old Covid strain too, nearly reaches pfizer moderna level require cold storage 0° C. good news poor countries like Oxford one. know countries people exist right? Everyone equal opportunity get vaccine. US entire world know. shows 155,145 Mexico 154,047 India

Article mixed India Mexico death tally B+ Read article said one reinfection could attributed new P1 strain manus. right sounds like dont really know. Slight zero. guys American.  apply people, hit hardest pandemic. feel like we're breaking mentally 2020/2020+... least us denied reality. That’s fun 04% people exposed, that’s 104% everybody got shot, whether exposed virus. percentage general population contracted Covid time? That’s comparison need. ...with restrictions shutdowns place, rate US, lock since pretty much April 2020?

Impressive. everyone else moved since knowledge, it’s common knowledge. 

Also chickenpox confer immunity varicella-zoster virus. body harbors virus re-emerge later life shingles. better example sterilizing immunity shown measles vaccine. There's plenty positions illinois you. Half teachers walked job friends school tried force go back deadly pandemic. already better paying jobs now, school came senses pulled ""we came senses changed mind, fired, teach remote learning vaccinated"" ex-teachers rightfully told go fuck themselves. - it’s taken way long vaccinate world. Israel entered chat... or, people tell someone trying manipulate honest, that's dare program shit show. fill mouth nose plaster never said anything people radically altering lives specific needs lol. Especially since I'm longer immunocompromised I'm personally ignorant many ways people medically vulnerable. I've seen argued times across different covid subreddits people distinctly different mindset toward cancer believe that's true based experience. order go 100% capacity indoor dinning etc need 260 million +/- vaccinated certain amount batch? 

I know ease restrictions accordance number variable (vaccinations, hospitalization/ICU capacity positive cases) know vaccinations holds weight equation, that’s ask. Oath lol, first country crush virus.. hundreds thousand deaths later people start abiding restrictions. however seems unlikely atm.  south Dakota 0.002% population died Covid. Illinois 0.0016% comparison instated lockdowns. despite fact red states tend unexplained pneumonia deaths year ignore now. Also despite fact Illinois far larger urban center SD SD less susceptible spreading virus general.

In relation Florida think may right dashboard cases also shows clearly state reporting numbers conflicted others thought number was. None builds trust Florida numbers.

Furthermore little oddity Florida lastly Florida death count least partially delayed two months meaning death figures Florida might simply look better take longer report.

Now know listed open states well Florida prove conspiracy I'm saying every single state. I'm saying I've looked Florida looking kinda shady.

The states, may issues reporting. might factors like population density, general population health, weather area size typical gatherings people made even normal times. 

This indicates really vs lockdowns may fair comparison may telling whole story. Even disregarding actual behaviour vs state says people do. See California prime example that. Locked down, theory only. They’re lost see actual deaths though worldmeter says third Covid19 death rates Thank facing fear. I’ve seen people refusing vaccine needle phobia, isn’t acceptable IMO. Pretty bogus stance; blaming individuals perceived lax behavior rather focusing identifying pre-symptomatic isolating them. treated like leper. assumed it

Well, guess that's want people act, ideally... towards you... hey, feel fine... Extra day get projects done. 😎 Look, never said deaths per capita shows America better. said cases per capita flawed. deaths per capita, rightly pointed out. probably LOT less flawed cases per capita. Excess deaths probably best, data available every EU country. US may well worse EU; gave argument contrary. pointing cases per capita flawed metric. vaccine resistant strains could arise everyone throws caution wind. Also, there's lot hesitancy historically untested stuff pregnancy since whole thalidomide story. /laughs Australian Remember, Fauci said many times job give science, sugar coat develop political policy that's popular. He's going pitch vaccine certain way people want hear way. gives science weighed calculus.

I mean, imagine vaccine stop infection stops severe illness, infection still resulted long-term issues infection others. People would angry communicated time vaccination. Fauci basically transparent science know status yet, conservative move wary there's consensus. Personally 102 fever second along stomach issues would probably classify ""violent"". Still thrilled lucky enough get it. Definitely worth losing weekend for. cause frontline workers one getting vaccine right now. really giving everyone. smiley face looks cute / funny used \^ nose. Reddit sees formatting superscript. make look right, need \\ \^

So would get :\^) instead :^) Best efforts doesn’t legally mean many people thinks does. It’s ‘I’ll try knows’ clause. deliver unless unforeseeable circumstance force majeure event prevents so. Normal production factory issues count. 

It’s Belgians inspected plant. EU show failure deliver due foreseeable issue force majeure related, AstraZeneca legally required supply agreed to.

Their purchase agreement AstraZeneca also doesn’t restrict supply one plant. AstraZeneca saying essentially. First--you're protecting anti-vaxxers. 

I work home. I'm getting vaccine April that.

I'm anti-vaxxer.

You're preventing resistant strains spreading preventing creation vaccine resistant strain arising.

Second--maybe people care should. We're talking short period time--and much longer drag economy vaccine resistant strains arise.

Depending production could couple months...people seriously would flub whole vaccination effort can't wait?

I cannot believe people sometimes. seems far 😭 Guess family lives, asshole? Australia. haven’t seen year. parents could get COVID probably wouldn’t get government approval see die.

It’s fault government run morons, take someone else. Sadly you’re probably right. take majority risk (i.e. Operation Warp Speed) get enjoy majority reward. That’s true. point virus run stupid people infect. ICU threshold, need sunset?

I'm trying compromise here, think reasonable ICU threshold could construed imply sunset, even would legislature (CO example) voters (CA example).

In state emergency powers rubber-stamped legislature. act like lapdogs governor. I'm suggesting even procedure renew emergency powers (again...indefinitely) needs questioned, least nature 
I never said was, given nationwide sitting 79% many areas lower that, 80% (which fess up, misread know it. said ""ICU demand"" instead availability) requirement go restrictions ""absurd"" seeing basically nowhere restrictions.

Sure, fine. .5 per 100 ppl? say 1 per 50? missing something Hahahaahahah...so Australia New Zealand didn’t? Like since year ago? I'd lot less annoyed that's titled articles 😃

You take care well, try remain hopeful ✊ What’s funny simple headline lot people going ballistic it’s actually geographically correct. Australia New Zealand eastern hemisphere.  It’s semantics really still looney tunes people worked whatever Asia Times is. literally people say wasting lives sitting alone eating TV dinners every single night US. ""If people *cared* others, they'd like me, taking seriously!"" absurdity statement top incredible.  


Every single person negatively affected lockdowns lack social contact actually dies result considered collateral damage countless theoretical lives saved(!!) absolutely nothing considered real prize. actual vulnerable populations (nursing home residents, people underlying medical conditions, etc) treated healthy 19 year old regardless overwhelming scientific evidence risk differential gigantic.  


The insufferable back-patting compliant masses continually reinforces good guy narrative. ""This irrational fear! I'm protecting people!"" Meanwhile millions plunged poverty, national debt skyrocketing huge corporations absorbing market share anytime history. 


Welcome world good, kind, thoughtful smart people. No. 400 million doses.
We also make vaccines locally.

We also upgraded vaccine capability next pandemic Captain Trips shows up!! work second vaccine scenario? Ah yes. [you’re right. thanks calling out. Maybe Young people like microchipped Gates. Nice job! convinced million people travel getting vaccine. Hope you’re happy. wash hand using toilet?

Do drink filtered, treated sterilized water supply?

Do bathe/shower regularly?

There many disease prevention methods baked daily lives, understand would refuse adopt particular one. ""I want wear mask"" ridiculous ""I drink sewer"". complicated...I wish better headline make clear.

I wish said-- 'it still possible become infected spread virus others even immunity kicks --2 weeks second dose. know people vaccinated.'

This crucial thing people know. possible vaccine gives sterilizing immunity. know. Vaccinated people still spread virus. we're also trying end spread society get back normal. travel make process take much longer.

A problem right apparently people care something hurt kill others bad economy things need society.

But normal people basically care human beings--I think could convince wait short time find infectious people give people chance vaccinated without dying first. Yeah, see nothing passage excluding Western nations, even mentioning 'Western nations' all. even Western nation exactly? understanding it’s supposed it’s weird concept. Shit! Like damn!   western nation quite bit ahead US terms vaccinations Israel Middle Eastern country. comments really stretching definition western. Thanks, enjoyed read. Interesting information article “Genetics may also help explain puzzle: illness reported Asian countries, even though Kawasaki disease far common children Asian ancestry. “ Yeah, grabbed *we bought up.* advantage major power player Western world industrialized infrastructure produce it. That’s even hating America. That’s fact. immense privilege allow us knock world, particularly developing nations lag behind us.

“Yahoo Europe.” Jesus. like live era globalized travel anything. Yes, predicated getting everyone get vaccinated. lazy ones, nutjobs, large number get vaccinated quickly. Yeah, that's heard too. wonder hospitalized suffer lots conditions could gotten hospitalized whether actually Covid. already got HEPA filtered battery powered one. don’t know. think east coast blue print states. It’s almost year. know exactly virus works point, via transmission. places excuse ignorance point. Hi! got results? Demanding 100% safety unreasonable IMO. CDC stated reasonably safe right precautions. Obviously that’s 100% people get sick even die. 

We implicitly make trade offs every day, risking death benefits worth (like driving car). It’s useful say “omg you’re willing sacrifice teachers schools reopen?” It’s numbers game. many teachers many students receiving person learning. response 1 teacher dying many, point driving analogy—I positive every year teachers die car crash going school. yet allow schools remain open. We’ve sacrificed teachers belief benefits person teaching worth it. 

So numbers matter. Nobody interested schools open means 10,000 teachers die result. nobody interested keeping closed save one two lives. CDC looked believes benefit person learning outweighs small increase infections occur result right precautions taken. mechanism completely different. Covid causes inflammation part sinus use smell. Dementia causes dopamine neurons die olfactory bulb. even close thing. Keep adding adjectives, US first eventually Exactly. UK added advantage AstraZeneca. good them! definitely try harder speaking yourself...”man”!...maybe even research own, form actual opinion instead cross...but may little idealistic... absence knowing certain vaccines curb spread, there’s push get us act don’t, think there’s number reasons that, including don’t “know” (scientifically) 100% certain also don’t want vaccinated people whatever want tempting unvaccinated.

This literally playbook since day 1. ""Americans stupid can't trusted. Purposefully misrepresenting information negative light way keep line."" 

I'm actually glad messaging reached point forces average person look actual science statistics rather succumb pressure total mindless compliance they're afraid branded scarlet letter ""anti-science"". Sorry. Hard tell internet. I've plenty people say living NZ authoritarian hell. put people camps. live dictatorship.

Honestly internet much better place many Americans tell difference Australia NZ. They're using similar spike pfizer/novavax/moderna. issue partial antigenic mismatch. Astra using slightly different spike crafted generate immunity original SARS-CoV-2 virus course, Reddit find way trash America applaud attempt really needs happen but...eh. So...exhausting... complain deaths? honestly never saw that, I'm familiar death certificates, understanding mostly done county level. 

SD well hospitalizations(57.00% According federal data updated 3 days ago , better total deaths per 100,000 fair amount east coast strict states. see random differences states tight policies, loose policies. FL. guess Kentucky, Utah, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Wyoming, West Virginia, Montana, Missouri, lying too? need collaboration epic proportions. understand people unwilling accept lot mitigations ""Spitballing"". mother law is, lack better term, dumb. sweetheart, love her. woefully uneducated, gets ""news"" scared old ladies Facebook. 

Anyway, telling us going get Covid vaccine, nobody knows long term risks side effects. 

It's tricky find respectful way saying, ""look. 67 years old, chronic chain smoker, diabetes two bad hips. really think going see 90? worry side effects 20 years virus might kill next week."" borders closed citizens, quarantine arrival (which expensive boring). issue actually getting country flights limited. Gotta send kids back school though! like secret vertical equator no-one’s ever heard of?

Yep, cuts london half UTC based it.  australia move west? Yeah can’t isolated forever, need population vaccinated able return normality   proof can't cure stupid Cross bridge get it.

This people constantly complain goalposts changing end sight. comes public policy ""indefinite"" essential ""infinite"". providing comprehensible end policy strict restriction tantamount delegitimizing it. first time government lied public ""the greater good"" AKA use masks healthcare workers them. Obviously terrible idea day people still skeptical need masks. Also, sure read comments. teachers ready work also need needlessly put risk. Get vaccine stay healthy keep educating kids pretty disappointed headline expected perform well better RNA vaccines, clarification different strains sounds like performing expected, South African variant evading immunity worse let UK variant led believe impact vaccine efficacy actually *is*, enough concerned moment. That’s control group exists basis comparison. MERS-trained T-cells cross-reactivity COVID-19, contribute lower numbers all? absolutely has. least worst option though given many students live multi generational homes. also strange that, given we've seen working months now, we've waited finish line sight revisit policies.  Testing rates EU countries absolutely terrible. recently tests become freely available anyone sick. US mass testing far longer definitely assholes. blocking exports Canada, Canada made deal first. EU get cut line fuck country? Western Hemisphere geographical term half Earth lies west prime meridian (which crosses Greenwich, London, United Kingdom) east antimeridian.

The vast majority Europe (including Germany, etc) Eastern hemisphere. Even fairly large chunk UK France is. I’d like look data, yes, great news. could mean still asymptomatic transmission, would go undetected. Still tho, plenty celebrate. well, damn lmao ""It's 95% effective, never sure!"" 
""We know definitively can't spread vaccinated even proven prevent symptoms!""  
""Look variants! It'll mutating years know effective strains!""  


There always another reason stay locked hidden away. What's happening number people saying ""The goal posts moving time"" reaching critical mass. I'm past 2 week window I'm really much differently. nothing else fact people still vaccinated means ain't really lot cool stuff there. EU gets steal Vaccines fucked negotiated late? Fuck that. Canada made deal ahead Europe fine fuck us over? Sure, countries remember this. Oh okay, gotcha. Hey, rock on. awesome. know that's easy situation, definitely earned place near top vaccine line. get want 65+ first since that's deaths are, book, teachers actually teaching school deserve next group. It’s Brazil , hasn’t everyone one? interested, here's link last year issue. Bit old, though. know, yeah. always worth shot, guess, least say something oppose views like that. seems becoming commonplace accepted sub honestly expected places.

It's honestly dangerous people come trying either subconsciously directly convince others forego progress we've made they're tired it. We're tired it, gotta keep going. light's end tunnel play right. considered western country, way Australia New Zealand western countries I’ll take word it. emotions volatile GME stock comes pandemic right now; can’t deal reversal far outstanding forward progress. Eat that, anti-vaxxers! ""essential"" worker effect changed. feels like timeline life/the decade/whatever dashed line mine feels... Italic 3 dimensions. Like sideways ramp monkeyball im skirrrting by. 

Im high say exposed to... Trends let remember passage time

Idk... Different people first obviously get priority. EU get block exports fucked Gotcha thanks Tom Brady though.  US clear start exporting. EU encouraged countries make deals EU waited, we're getting fucked. Surely tired winning Oh, Snap! Thanks. even notice mentioned it. 🫂 It’s going like 9-11 rescuers gulf war syndrome mean true competition Canada, soo first place 2 article. 16 sent hospital

Oh shit. thought vaccine supposed protect 100% Except Canada made deal first... priority? shouldn’t really mysterious post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I’ve wondered deliberately targeted, way many insulting complaining comments opening everything back place seriously discuss covid 19 Agreed. 

You get used it, pretty quickly. many people feel initial discomfort (which natural, new different) give up. 

I’ve wearing masks since March last year. sucked up, worked anxiety, got used wear 40 hours week. don’t even notice wear it, it’s another piece clothing. (And keeps nose warm it’s cold!) coworkers severe asthma breathing issues also doubling *because Covid worse could kill them.* would rather deal masks, adjust to, consequences Covid where, y’know, would REALLY unable breathe. Don’t like able breathe? You’ll really hate Covid, then. interact vaccinated people vaccinated yourself. 7500 vaccinated first responders gather place another group unvaccinated people going unmitigated disaster. treat like invasive species. wouldn't. guarantee 10-20 years we'll seeing tons mesothelioma-like ads TV. 

""Do trouble breathing? even walk stairs anymore? may covid-induced chronic heart disease, may entitled payout boss forced continue selling cheeseburgers fat slobs coughing day long 2020 2021!"" Yeah Canada getting lowered doses bs idiots youtube saying can't find enough people vaccinate. target quickly, identify virus first also best part target vaccine.

mRNA tech useful many things. come timesofisrael posting results, I'm familiar reputable? Anyone sources corroborate? Great point! long vaccine receive comes pretty good phase 3 results, wait ""premium"" vaccines e.g pfizer/moderna.  reasonable take. pisses teachers saying getting vaccinated prerequisite person teaching. I'm OK that. Teachers need school teaching NOW, CDC says reasonably safe, teachers need prioritized essential workers get shots soon. You’re arguing someone isn’t capable listening. Lagged weekend. Thursday/Friday cases usually jump. joke serious? 84 years parents got jab Saturday - went smoothly - hope second goes well. quite relief. PFFT. listens experts? /s Happy cake day! law large numbers? Larry King’s widow said died sepsis. 🙁 hope take much offense (I'm random Internet person probably won't), CDC says reasonably safe open schools right precautions, schools open. yes, teachers school teaching, essential worker category vaccinations looking get shots next couple months.  Basically. women say way unborn kid’s sake. understandable us person. I've face face teaching five days week since September. We've many Covid cases school, including one classroom (that know of). students eat lunch masks off, desks. We're supposedly list vaccinated (the Superintendent took information last week). idea we'll actually get shot though. ridiculous. notified work insurance doctor county want mine soon turn. cannot wait things again.  miss issues method determining deaths changed resulting shift reported deaths well significant numbers deaths reported two months late? There's lot questions issues data coming Florida firing data scientist certainly inspire confidence.

Lastly let's say ignore say data 100% true possible maybe count delayed pretty much accurate. also question different states policies vastly differently? south Dakota regulation far tell shockingly bad per capita. strict lockdown states hand also higher Florida. suggest could weather (in Florida outdoor gatherings impossible cold elsewhere). issue many lockdown states really locked down. People keep visiting friends family assume going bar restaurant curb spread. IE people actually following lockdown strict lockdown states. yeah, looked up, recommended 5 weeks ago ""highly suggestive"" severe overstatement study really narrowed ""somewhere 20% 80% effective."" Even lockdowns next teeth outside businesses. compare neighboring states like Norway Finnland similar population density climate. Sweden ten times much Covid deaths them. Good Corona response something else.  They're basically European people Also Canadians still getting information facebook Canada working Vaccine Calgary based company's produce human trials prove successful. Mrna type early trials project around moderna phizer effective. easily find major news outlet , Facebook news outlet. think hidden factor many people go visit friends family despite lockdown say 'oh I'm visiting closest friends one friend'

I've seen justification lot things. Depends want look classical definition societies west inspired ancient Greece considered birthplace western culture. look Americas western hemisphere. also iron curtain east v west definition. 2nd generation covid (SECGEN) need start vaccination competitions.  Ok Dwight died Covid, mild death. ***When Axios' Jonathan Swan pointed number US Covid-19 deaths population percentage, Trump said: 'You can't that'.***

Cuomo comes faux-populist school former USA President.

You're meant look deaths per million otherwise, find ""rogue countries"" like Brazil Sweden way better ""good boy"" countries like Belgium Italy.

And ""rogue states"" like Florida Texas way better ""good boy"" states like NY California. can't compare USA Sweden though. US many metro areas pump numbers up. Sweden barely one. 

North Carolina roughly population significantly lower death rate. Roughly race demographics substitute black middle eastern. Charlotte Raleigh easily compare Sweden's largest cities. Buy phizer!!! dealing public policy

Public policy changes quite often, constitution. People normally adaptable, especially case pandemic. suppose. think get go back however asking go back cannot get think fair. think we're page. imagine common people wearing kind uncomfortable protection day? People complain normal masks wear hours. even summer yet. US finally found vector progress could advance throwing money it. go-to move, good it. Australia: Lol, New Zealand, look this

New Zealand: Can't talk right now, busy raving maskless music festival distribution age causing huge *fuss disabled, diabetes, chronic conditions communities... virus read birth certificate, risk going medical facilities (telehealth can't draw blood change ostomy) could wear mask drive home Walmart knowing 30s masked interaction cashier endanger him? attitude like bottom pile. We’re humans doesn’t matter you’re born everyone entitled vaccine. got second dose two days ago. low fever aches, soreness injection site, skin sensitivity. Thankfully lasted one day. 

My dad got weeks back nearly knocked 48 hours straight. man sitting hot tub set max heat shivering. variability side effects (even within families) quite interesting. really don’t understand mask wearing agonized over. It’s least intrusive public safety measure imaginable. It’s less burden seatbelt car.  expect coming September latest (or whenever schools back trigger companies switch back brick &amp; mortar). imagine step further: people lying jobs saying able get shot yet got it. keep benefits WFH benefits vaccinated. course right-to-work states could cut people position. never heard anything yet angle. may mandatory get vaccine, mandatory report precisely got &amp; show proof dates? someone could theoretically get summer tell company till next spring &amp; company ask proof got got too? one could beat virus like me!!!!! Except maybe Abraham Lincoln 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️ haven’t given reason downward trend, present, means masks longer mandated. [They receiving i'm virologist [there 2000 cases MERS reported probably i'd guess? Yes , one mask works ok communication. 2 starts get like scuba diving. Consider also people poke heads around plexiglass checkout counters. None figured sufficiently yet.

Also, person glasses I've surprised discover surgeons must using poorly engineered masks actually make seal time 🙄😣 Ah yes, us always number 1. US many layers administration it’s wonder anything ever gets done could gone back semi normal place half country didn’t treat like nothing. Correct Novavax. efficacy Novavax variant Phase II study still high enough would considered successful vaccine process started, goal generally agreed 50% efficacy.

And that's unimaginably large error bars. could 20% effective 80% effective variant, know data small.

It also worth noting despite world leader particular variant, cases dropping quickly South Africa. reported deaths: (press ""Deaths / 1M pop"" sort column)

For excess deaths: (sadly bit updated, least get view discrepancy reported excess deaths countries) see did. upvote confirm. Brazilian ex-girlfriend's cousin turned fire breathing iguana.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Maaaaybe. Masking last thing go. despite reddit's general freakout them, least restrictive measure gives lot bang buck. vary heavily state, cautious states might give masking they're absolutely, postiively certain resurgence happening. easily imagine concerts sporting events full crowds still mask requirement. Who/China wants downplay Taiwan Vietnam's success of, know, obvious reason.... Western culture falters told must something. nothing mask. west told underwear mandatory nobody would ever check, people used wear would brag going commando. Vaccines spiders! Made day, slightly terrified me. Quick question: Western Australia close borders one wants go anyway? Yup! That’s recommended pregnant women get it. Everyone hellbent vaccine trend one considering science. Yeah, problems could 'ironed' time... Belgium #1 deaths per million Brazil #24? Manneken Pis Boy cursed something? course right 5.5% californians received dose closer 8%. according cdc, california nearly 3 million doses says like 1.8 million Ah yes, good old ""4 million people died, what's big deal another half million"" line. means hospitalisation rates still high? seems big part everything boils Palestinians doing? loudmouth, mistake complaints genuine concerns. matter many BS excuses counter, they'll always find another that's intent. know much much treat covid now. north east didn’t luxury. 

Notice screeching ventilators completely stopped? harm good better stuff mow. ashamed citizens. Oh joy Great news. makes EU vaccine rollout disaster painful true? Palestinians free leave Gaza? They're like that. force Tegnell wear mask. They're cavalier suffering 80+. shows value put educators whole education system.

You mean craptastic salaries evidence enough? Beats hell dying. countries standards lockdown either. went alert level 2 That’s actually great news nobody sick, especially high risk sample one.

Pfizer 10 today I'm awful arm pain, headaches chills I'm freaking *delighted* reactogenicity. working, working!  BEAT VIRUS. LOT! Yup..it's unfortunate. MIL already said getting vaccine. 70 years old.  needs stop watching youtube videos ""doctors"" saying vaccine never tested microchipped. Very. Frustrating. Novavax's sample size small statistical sginificance. also likely even SA variant reduces vaccines efficacy preventing symptomatic disease it'll still protect severe infections, thus still saving medical systems overwhelmed.  Matthew McConaughey hero need.

""Alright, alright alright, who's wearing mask again???""

Maybe Mr. too

""I pity fool accept vaccine"". Lol, what?

Imagine headline previous administration. replaceable, need that.  think western developed cultural description rather geographical. I'm NZ would consider Australia western country. cause culturally NZ Australia culturally similar countries like UK, Ireland, US etc due colonisation. Give time, able grow full beard eventually guy knows take care wife. That's inspectors come in. Belgium sending inspectors AZ plant near Brussels check exactly happening. indeed supply issue? AZ fuck EU promising X seeing can't reach overselled going supply ones paid more? Cause that's unfair contractually possible. 

The EU stop exports company playing dirty following planned distribution vaccines. remember took mask drink water, talked friend ages never bothered put back on. also remember wife kept touching mask despite Fauci's recommendations know, never touch mask.

IF Trump's awful COVID response, *everyone* would universally hating Fauci, Cuomo, Newsom, etc.... Nah man, live place required relatively early wear one (properly) everywhere required. hate every single second it. Doubt spike protein mutation could lead higher infection rate, possesses what’s called “escape mutation.” Also found South Africa variant, mutation, known E484k, could help evade coronavirus antibodies. ""You never safe!""

Yes, yes safe. Dude, America vaccinating 1,5 million people day Nether...because never safe ;) Well one, .5 per 100 1 50 East Asia, including China, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam Japan, used combination harsh lockdowns, social discipline, technology bring pandemic control. 

This deeply misleading. Japan done almost nothing. South Korean certainly harsh lockdowns. Vietnam open tourism. Taiwan essentially closed borders, almost spread, lockdowns.

China harsh lockdown, end extremely limited spread.

Given know now, portion population existing immunity Covid, probably T-cell mediated response past exposure related viruses, given natural reservoir Covid horseshoe bats endemic East Asia, think much likely answer populations region much higher pre-existing resistance Covid.

Just look Japan: big, dense country early exposure virus. Japan never anything, really. lockdowns, schools open, everyone work. People crowded trains.

Meanwhile, countries like Argentina, essentially 100% mask usage early pandemic. Mandatory mask usage, large fines enforced. Draconian lockdowns, massive disruptions life, probably longest lockdown anywhere world, starting March - yet still control spread.

There's proof immunity theory true, really, else could possibly be? *every* country East Asia limited spread, fan East Asia, gets worse? 100k/day.  Ain't Carolinas got lot them, anyways? I'm probably canceling NYT digital subscription. consistent issue every good news comes out. infuriating I've one strict rules staying home. I'm getting exhausted pessimism. I'll stick crosswords. Although Novavax J&amp;J already released data EU approve shortly hopefully make slower delivery AZ. maybe bad Thank you!

Now Swissmedic give green light, too! Well, must say control group consisting 10% total population quite impressive. borders closed citizens overseas. There’s caps they’re closed Bruh EU throwing false accusations AstraZeneca threatening take UK supplies. think wrong??? Plus I’m saying UK good, simply smart betting across wide variety vaccine companies securing good terms early on. none would possible still apart Europe agree seems bizarre, unfortunately know several people fit category. current environment cant take granted human many factors could lead people believing falsehoods, regardless job role. Also black community legitimate reasons suspicious based historical injustices documented current systemic bias POC medical community. can't say ""trust me, fine time"" expect people quickly jump board aware factors and/or personally experienced reasons mistrust medical community. ways try earn trust using public figure show safe one ways.  reason basically nothing else done before... oversized Oompaloompa charge.

Wait... actually, that's insulting towards Oompaloompas... actually jobs. Still given limited supply well distribution logistics old aunt likely won’t choice vaccine gets. Alright, thanks clarifying. Personally I’ll take whatever vaccine get. severe cases day 50 seems wonderful. Yes dr, lot colleagues cant read study lives. honestly wish could report negligence. cant believe people graduated medschool whithout able read scientific paper. One promoting chloride dioxide  sheets ""keep virus away"" already fired still... It’s better nothing, wonder much vaccine really help use right nation. low numbers vaccinated, I’m concerned promote spread anything else. people still getting sick emboldened certitude won’t die, feel like represent larger disease vector. realize that’s issue vaccine rn, seems pose greater threat since people getting sicker, would presumably infectious.  moderna vaccine showed reduced neutralizing titers SA variant boosted patients. single dose mrna vaccines looks poor compared prime/boost animal studies assumed would work poorly variant Luckily U.S. cultivated multiple successful vaccines population fully vaccinated Q2, we'll able start giving vaccines lesser developed areas EU, Africa, etc. half Novavax global production capacity gonna based EU. [Their Czech plant alone capacity around one billion doses per also signed agreement Baxter make vaccine GSK gonna play big role EU vaccination plans anyway since vaccines gonna ready Q4 2021. 62% efficient. 90% based 1.5 doses regimen IIRC UK/EU rejected gone 2 dose regimen. Also prevents hispitlisation key cases two separate categories. Essential workers 50 preexisting conditions, essential workers preexisting conditions another category. Non-essential workers 50 pre-existing conditions, 18-50 pre-existing conditions. 

They separate like many different state plans. That’s issue, people disabilities ignored, even though risk die also. say that? Bloody near everything closed here, med-grade masks even required public.

You go grocery shopping, mask. place usually shop guys parking lot reminding people put mask on, even parking lot.

There crime scene style tape everywhere line might form. guys counting people grocery stores. certain number allowed inside time. Wait turn.

Fun days consists bottle wine, sofa, Netflix chill. That's numbers going (finally). debate? slightly lower efficacy, I'm *assuming* they'd prioritize JNJ younger + healthy people, I'm sure anyone much guess point. main advantage **storage** well single dose. frankly, two doses makes effective, people get fact go pharmacy twice. Americans wondering 4 years. people talking like hundreds millions doses available, one wants them, trying make seem like massive amount population vaccines. Sanofi vaccine also? Pfizer delay month? almost like taking longer sign deal pandemic lead delays. find disappointed J&amp;J info. want partially effective vaccine. want one good ones. Even 85%, absolute game-changer, many countries cost vaccines, along supply chain needed transport them, unattainable. help “back normal” timeline all? effect it? know supposed ample Pfizer/Moderna vaccine summer I’d like know makes much difference US. good news people get vaccinated anyways, would still safe even still transmitted, since virus wouldn’t really big threat deaths hospitalizations anymore. guess still transmitted, even vaccine (but i’m literally random guy internet might speaking bs) don’t want kids school fall masks. me, defeats purpose school. letters numbers.

They “not taxing” would pretty big move, could big talk. worry Pfizer, BioNTech said they're actually gonna deliver initially thought. think Jansen one may problem EU serious, especially considering J&amp;J said production issues. Lol teachers laziest self-righteous people planet. CDC even Fauci said in-person learning needed major vector transmission. Teachers honest admit don’t want work. Organ failure death ? Well, far know UK US exporting vaccines either; God knows EU allowed that. Keep information high quality. sick people understand anxiety think therapist fixes   rest us ""so sick"" people coming online forums using personal diary. like people giving advice, come bitching anxiety makes life hard, person struggling this. 2 months ago Russians claimed 69% 1st dose (also Ad26 recombinant vector-based vaccine ) Also arguably sides merit. German approach guess cautious due lack data. EMA/UK approach also merit since even though lack data think results earlier studies suggest elderly still antibodies results expected upcoming US trial far nothing suggest efficient elderly. supply limited thousands dying day obviously decided benefits outweigh risks. That's fine. We're waiting around start reopening though. D00mers looking stupid every day, love it! wondering this. 


I make appointment mom. use phone check email visit webpages, anything complicated ""I Googled!"" difficult, basically impossible. expect seniors able jump hoops necessary sign multiple things, navigate sign pages, fight appointments, etc.? something never thought about, I'm extremely frustrated happening.

How much vaccine manufacturing capacity world? governments stepped ramp emergency production existing vaccines manufacturers vaccines? 

If ever example ""putting money lives,"" would it. gives shit Pfizer's profits? Hand vaccine IP like candy. There’s nothing saying single dose mRNA wouldn’t deal variants. particular, early Israel data country strong prevalence SA variant. already it...?  Life much fun people read discussed narrow areas personally experts in.

As long people claim actual experts, they're free debate anything want amuses them. guys think J&amp;J distributed. Right know NJ can’t choose vaccine getting probably won’t know appointment. appointments start listing type vaccine receiving. Like you’ll J&amp;J appointments verse mRNA appointments. 35 days first dose? sever infection, got covid didn’t need hospital 2/3rds month. it’s severe I’m alive. vaccine prevents even that, would pretty cool. Commission went incompetent truly mad.

The EU litigation AZ.

Not UK, countries dependent exports.

Even think hardly justified here, want impose penalties, target AstraZeneca.

The results get, damage commercial reputation alienate allies fistful doses get us far anyway. UK tiny market compared EU. AZ even remotely try fulfill contract EU suffer huge damage reputation. global pandemic, would even surprise trademark protections could discussed pull contract like that. Good question. Could ask Merkel? would like ask ask trial. outsmart virus. Haha comment lay words mouth never said. would know read completely. 

Haha.... think really depends demographic. feel like used general population. people less co morbidities. I’m sure they’ll keep tweaking it, see Pfizer/Moderna used mainly vulnerable demographics Vaccines become effective time. time reach day 45, noticeable increase effectiveness antibodies day 5. 

Anthony Fauci even expected first vaccine 50% effective. Yeah, seems things clearly defined. get hit car decide go hospital mean injuries severe? IMHO, undetermined. think good points. good news mrna vaccines take little time synthesize produce compared traditional vaccines. go sequencing therapeutic rna making drug short order. Hopefully, bode well boosters future new mutations discovered. downside relatively facilities equipment needed produce vaccines, storage transport issues mrna vaccines have. Hopefully put resources toward improving things.

Good luck getting biomedical researchers say anything declarative well something works😂. I’m medical investigator, work them, it’s nature science they’ll usually make hedged inferences based available evidence strenuously avoid definitive conclusions statements fact. Maybe years data sets enormous, wouldn’t guess time soon. scientists make definitive statements, I’d bet people and/or governments say, “this good enough, livelihoods social cohesion can’t put longer.” Seriously. I'm totally okay skipping line means Black americans getting vaccinated. Yes rich famous priviledge fair, benefits outweigh Children teens least affected age group covid. time kids would return school, teachers adults would likely already vaccine. can’t keep putting education longer. It’s easy adults say “keep schools closed!” never whole grade school online. Online school complete disaster there’s way kids parents going want yet another year it. guys included doctors nurses live.

they're getting second shots now. math correct... 
Cool דרך אגב, לפחות בארה״ב, לא אומרים ״pupil״ אם הכוונה היא לתרגם ״תלמיד״; אומרים ״student״. 30 billion dollars (at least!) lost fraud last year watch. He’s horrible governor. sub seems love though. think people trust Trump Administration told truth vaccine safety, rushed, many anti-vaxxers? much 3? Anti-vaxxers skip far I'm concerned. I'll take doses suffer full effects COVID. Natural consequences, man. Heard first minister Scotland daily briefing test positivity rate 5% two weeks means epidemic control reopening begin. article discusses detail : sure know article talking reference Here’s good study comparing common Covid effects flu. Slightly more, enough shut world for. well follow vaccines fair South African Brazilian variants. brains brexited aswell seems you’re immune can’t pass don’t worry it. Fauci isn’t making law here. He’s asking people careful case still pass on. fucks sake don’t want DON’T! know sure can’t pass anyone else DOESN’T APPLY YOU! isn’t hard. Protect others don’t. I’m tired arguing this. Can’t wait whataboutism, false equivalence, like response you. Since it’s tough year all, sorry hard time- whatever reasons ❤️🙏🏻

I know assuming anything me. fortunate able work home stayed employed entire time, count blessings. know harder me. never claimed 'having hard time'.

Still, deny goalposts moved fucking playing field disingenuous. People lost businesses entire livelihoods feel people. given support deserved needed government. forced close doors forced work yet handed measly 1,200 bucks.

Sure, easy say, ""It's hard stay home,"" life largely unaffected pandemic (other severely reduced amount social interaction), people suffered far me, whether loss life loss income. Telling people keep hunkering providing financial support simply feasible option.   Unfortunately, not... Lmao throwing UK ""good"" EU bad discussion. Can't let go you? Pathetic, give rest. lawyers taking view it’s media public health officials

That's damn lie.

Here's one PH talking it: - find many others too. country negotiated supply chain separately. UK ""paid more"" vaccine. means vaccine cost more, sold cost. extra 'cost' spent better supply chain facilities. EU can't choose negotiate lowest spend supply chain main manufacturing plants, request supplies come UK paid extra get supply chain set sooner efficient. 

The option receive doses UK supply chain added, seen something might used later deliveries (as parties likely well aware UK going getting first 100M doses), UK priority facility - contract even suggests ideally avoid using UK factories completely possible. 

Clearly UK would expect supply chain facility paid get setup, suddenly switch making doses another client paid slight upgrades it. Remember UK sites huge teething issues deliveries Q4 2020 cut 30M 4M 0.5M. time started actually producing 2M week, someone paid supply chain 3 months later wanting use early originally expected. 

If way around? EU setup facilities 3 months UK, lots issues got sorted UK paid get UK facilities setup later, faced issues well. Rather go teething issues well, demand get doses EUs smoothly running pipeline. EU facilities start sending UK instead (even though EU contract said get first 100M doses produced become shared facility)?

Is anyone actually thinks UK, caused issues, doses cut another country cheaped supply chain. sir, that's not... article mention sectoon ""EU"" defined purpose manufacturing Manufacturing Sites 
AstraZeneca shall use Best Reasonable Efforts manufacture vaccine manufacturing sites located EU (**which, purpose section 5.4 shall include United Kingdom**) may manufacture Vaccine non-EU facilitis, appropriate, accelerate supply Vaccine Europe...

No?

Worthless...

This global vaccine meant healthy people developing countries. Maybe true, maybe not. saying used see people wear masks (in shops etc.), now, barely see anyone mask more!  100% figure 4 weeks.

Also companies going hesitant setting EU, especially pharmaceutical companies.

Also, wonder point astrazenica void contract. 2020: ""If wore masks, mask, we'd beaten thing. Americans don't.""

2021: ""Lol masks useless unless they're high-grade fitted."" timeline make sense? wife thinks anaphylactic reaction vaccine 2 weeks given?? Yes dunno teachers pretty old virus causes blood clots semipermanent possibly permanent damage, teachers paid shit babysit deserve get vaccinated. Unlike 65+ stay home, teacher choice.  lot people would considered severe disease won’t treated hospital. example O2 saturation low terribly low many doctors opt treat oxygen meds home, mainly due fact hospitals are/were overwhelmed. not? Don’t want successful flu it’s dangerous? consider that. It’s pretty irritating Yes. disappointed. 

Knowing ones 95% effective, one seems disappointmenting me. 

I want one ones. Soon ban countries Why? really national mask mandate. federal property mandate. Yeah that's it. based kind logic truth either, next it'll brain control implants, 6G devices, sterilising vaccines whatever paranoid bullshit comes next. get questions vaccines trying make sense pros cons whether worth accept risks, ANTI vaccine means willing look whole picture. vaccines around long know risks percentage number, plus risk whatever disease trying prevent. 

So much easier make decision grounded statistics there, that's try reason people covid vaccine present evidence today says safe. That's best individual decide (as right), someone refused take vaccine ever there's much help Good questions, bro. Excellent questions.

- Sanofi ask Macron France. forced Sanofi partner [just] Sanofi French firm. firm promised everything, but, according latest reports, Sanofi badly failed help produce Biontech(!) vaccine Q4(!!!).

- Pfizer got serious delays. Pfizer properly promptly reported EU problems production, explained reason - modernization. seems, Pfzier solved problems according promises going increase production much level modernization.

- Biontech(real developer vaccine BNT162b2) works better expected. Fabric Marburg(Biontech bought fabric October) may solve problems vaccine EU Q2. Also summer Biontech provide modified vaccine may distributed without deep cold.

As immediate reserve Moderna(European production) around 50-100 millions, AZ(also) around 100-150. 
Also immediate hot reserve see CureVac(new vaccine) facility Frankfurt(can't recall isi owner) produce Biontech vaccine.

So Q2/Q3 looks good. problem.

The real problem Q1. Nobody wants die. Nobody wants kill economy.  Didn’t say wearing two didn’t make difference? Make fucking mind!! Fair enough. That's long ways away. least another 5 months. point Canada manufacturing country. EU probably largest manufacturing capacity world, companies busy exporting vaccine countries. need full export ban now. go sold NFL game fall long wear mask, I’d gladly it. doesn't, read whole text, you? 13.1 (e)

""it   obligation, contractual  otherwise,  Person  third party  respect  Initial Europe Doses  conflicts   inconsistent  material respect  terms  Agreement  would impede complete fulfillment  obligations Agreement;""

Prior commitments matter masks useless ill-fitted.

So people saying masks useless past year right?

Come think it, anything tightly fitted, high-grade masks useless, year people wearing cloth masks, surgical masks, bandanas worse useless. 

It gave everyone false sense security. people repeatedly claimed Americans wore mask, mask, would over.

It mountain misinformation. It’s “help advice” thread. It’s discussion thread, “help advice” one subset discussion.

You’re right many people naturally react way, developing empathy means learning reaction frequently unhelpful reconsidering people get flu shot simply laziness. :D Yep:

J&amp;J know prevents long-haulers? so? saving lives one already contract vaccines deliverer. best effort circumstances getting. Something seen covered article others read morning: 

It 66% effective across regions. means although people going hospital dying, people still getting ""mildly"" sick virus receiving vaccine. known someone received shot gets sick still contagious people? Could carrier/spreader virus J&amp;J vaccine? ask someone (who isn’t anti-vaxxer) whether want single shot make die, they’ll generally take offer. That’s public health officials marketing this. question.

How soon receiving first vaccination shot person still contract covid?

I live community living (halfway house) dealing covid outbreak. Five positives 30 residents. Monday (1/25) others received first shot Moderna's vaccine. 

At time couple residents quarantine. Wednesday got word one person tested positive. Around 4pm yesterday got word four people tested positive, total five.

Now entire house quarantine, awaiting covid tests (which coming fast enough, that's another thing entirely).

Both one roommates got first vaccine shot Monday. unclear exposed virus after, wanted clarity susceptible time frame.

Full disclosure, major symptoms yet. slight cough roommate, slight itchy sensation/cannot fully clear throat feeling myself. Ah. Didn’t realize different. issue chocolate bar already sold customers. said time teachers adults return school, teachers adults likely gotten vaccine. Obviously isn’t best time return school literally excuses adults teachers get vaccinated. Kids need go back school. Yes I'm sure Peter Daszak thrilled ask questions. mean great prevents severe infection risk already relatively low. question would prevent long-term side effects people experience? seems medication reduce hospitalization rates really prevent COVID spreading causing long-term damage. That's good, necessarily silver bullet. really beautiful thing life people concerns outside personal scope. Israel horrible terrorist state. please stop using examples. plenty countries contradict - think helps argument beyond That's quite right interpretation though.

There tons circulating flu variants every year, vaccine makers guess 3-4 strains spread. vaccine effective strains, often guess well leaves protection variants.

That's number fluctuates much, vaccine lower efficacy virus family general.

But correct many people get vaccine lower efficacy rating offers. still great vaccine, looks good better. problematic storage requirements.

We need shots arms end this. drastically speed goal. Apparently gotten notice Zero COVID acceptable option /s Congrats, buddy! happy you!! 🎉 Already works:  listened conference call well. got J&amp;J shot October (volunteered trial may gotten placebo shot) I've watching developments closely.

This implies EU’s initial doses, UK sites used produce them. Doses produced using UK sites EU’s initial doses produced EU, detailed section 5.4. 

And btw don’t want EU suffer, honestly want get enough vaccines. thing annoys EU trying blame others incompetence. there’s anyone mad at, it’s leaders EU  important note efficacy tuberculosis vaccine that's commonly given hospital settings high risk areas.

It's _didn't_ that's problematic.

It'd weird vaccine conferred *zero* reduction infectiousness, reduction infectiousness could reduction symptomatic infection (\~95%), could higher (close 100%?), could significantly lower (50%?). 60% - still great.


The South African study included volunteers HIV. Among HIV-negative volunteers, vaccine appears 60 per cent effective. Including volunteers HIV, overall protection 49 per cent, company said. genetic testing still underway, far 90 per cent COVID-19 illnesses found South African study appear due new mutant. Dude. It’s Asia Times. we’re claiming it. safer getting early access vaccine makes virus null void?  Still around 500,000 people received second dose UK Seriously. +1 awareness, something people apparently lacking. way people twist narratives appalling times. people willfully tune reality experience false sense happiness? Fully vaccinated already build immunity. I'd say chances low obviously guarantee symptoms reportedly mild, dry cough one case, coughing, sore throat headache second. require cases underscore many variants could already circulating Brazil raise concerns among scientists co-existence two strains body could speed mutations new variants “These co-infections generate combinations generate new variants even quickly happening,” said study’s lead researcher Fernando Spilki, virologist Feevale University Rio Grande Sul state. EU 450 million people.  course deaths. Awesome! think experts going push ideal outcome pandemic management standpoint, they're going let perfect become enemy good. 

No one gonna give single shit covid family members vaccinated. That's objective truth. 

I'm probably towards back line, time access think moral dilemma left. vast majority people left protect point people want anyone's protection first place.

I'm perfectly happy part everyone wants vaccine it, I'm wasting moment life protect anti-vaxxers. thing vaccinate people already infected thing vaccinated first time. body stick old antibodies.

 [Original antigenic sin: comprehensive review - support people owning guns really understand much them.

Sorry, I'm really disagreeing anything. taking moments vent reddit someone sounds reasonable enough understand I'm coming from. You're, right. Added list said comparison previous pandemics. Even hardcore anti-lockdowners demanding than, say, 1918, working home scale impossible quite recently.

And yes, agree, governments latched onto social distancing cost anything seems ""easy"" comparison. really easy all, think much people depend human connection contact... know fallout be, can't learn much pandemics, quarantines simply done scale. best vaccine currently following phase 3 trial results original Coronavirus, well still solid vaccine new variants. 

Great news, looking forward seeing phase 3 trial numbers support this, Canadian I'm getting little desperate good news. 2 ""crushed"" smallpox. saw Twitter virologist saying SA variant need whole new vaccine we’re back square one, normalcy coming 2021. think that’s enough social media tonight.  blind fact cause people avoid taking vaccine? simply care point? 1,000 miles south Manaus. 

This word year.

I'll always reflect 2020 year people collectively lost nuance critical thinking. Everything black white. agree going 300 person party terrible idea right now, calling people selfish year extreme isolation petty non productive. 

A lot people interacted another person year they're FINE, even prefer it. Others dealing profound mental struggle say it... no, miss ihop Applebees whatever fuck phrase bounced around Reddit echo chamber months. miss friends, family routines gave purpose. miss things made life worth living, surviving.

That's hard enough, mob slobbery mouth lunatics screaming grandma killer grabbing beer friend make easier. halt trial approve Well, don’t see person get sick die, it’s completely abstract. They’ll never know, don’t worry it. 

I agree though, mental health single person outweigh health whole community people. know that’s unpopular view Reddit. I’m finding ways alleviate real problems, possibly spreading disease around people can’t get vaccinated yet simply isn’t it. think people it’s copout. blame mental health, don’t want uncomfortable wait bit they’re perfectly capable.

Not lawyer, look particularly good EU? lawyers about? actual agreement published backs company saying. Yes, country representing people allegedly indigenous middle east, speak semitic language semitic genes, western.  Canada can’t relate. UK contract irrelevant, basically key unlocks door. UK contract says UK based vaccines go UK contract fulfilled, EU one saying they'll use UK another contract different terms breach contract EU, seems pretty clear able use UK stock UK order fulfilled, exported. So, what's going happen winning teams fans go street celebrate? team comey back home? Again? league bother think things. guess money!!!! back yet normal, long shot!!!! WAKE PEOPLE!!!! 5 uses (as donning doffing procedure) many times actually reuse. structural integrity mask begin deteriorate quite abit.  Could provide source?

If looking average measures since April wonder Norway Finland less strict policies cases summer (Fi&amp;No days zero cases versus Sweden days zero deaths).  joke right? Initial safety data going well first, jump cliff would next level morally reprehensible held back vital ingredients vaccine. That’s straight killing people. anti vaxxers.

The ones 60 probably recover home without hospitalization, subset recover home might looking maybe 5-10 percent population. one going wait feel bad get sick end needed intensive care get vaccinated. EU would literally let elderly brits die vaccinate young. They're even using AZ vaccine anyone 65. Madness. 6.2 refers agreements entered commission   6.2 even adds AZ breach agreement extent impeded competing agreements (so presumably one UK).

this refers agreements ""entered behalf Commission"", related UK Danisk mink mutation returns! thought week mutation, wrong. wait new one next week. Exactly. sure mentioned more.

If EU take approach unreasonable UK may limit ban exports lipids EU. combatative approach exactly cover EU glory.... saying US first west nation crush covid abit wrong then. UK ahead vaccinations probably first one crush covid thr US. Although technically I'd argue Australia/NZ first Western nations crush covid since they're pretty much back normal. correct title would US among first Western nations reach herd immunity vaccinations good chance full block vaccines ever enter UK happen  sound like every Trudeau hater places feelings facts. spewing fucking nonsense. know, Johnson &amp; Johnson also run part trial there, AstraZeneca.  want UK send across even using at-risk populations. 

Do realise bad looking rest world this? Bad news still reach back throat.

&amp;#x200B;

(shamelessly stolen Seth Meyers) many Palestinians did?  Same. I’m excited second dose thanks EU fucking Europe vaccines 100m doses supply EU believe. I've read down. They're committed delivering per Schedule work commission find contractors issues producing required amount. breach section 13 probably.

(b) it(AZ) power authority execute deliver Agreement to
perform obligations hereunder; 


(e) it(AZ) obligation, contractual otherwise, Person third
party respect Initial Europe Doses conflicts inconsistent
in material respect terms Agreement would impede the
complete fulfillment obligations Agreement; Especially anything includes date, unhelpful. Except UK manufacturers chemical compounds needed make Pfizer vaccine EU, would seem issue! Kids pose significant risk health safety others room? 

Regardless. think IEP angle bit bad faith since obviously student medical conditions prevent masking student helped find safety measures. Here's clause referring (e): obligation, contractual otherwise, Person third party respect Initial Europe Doses conflicts inconsistent material respect terms Agreement would impede complete fulfillment obligations Agreement;

Best Reasonable Efforts means ""in case AstraZeneca, activities degree effort company similar size similarly-sized infrastructure similar resources AstraZeneca would undertake use development manufacture Vaccine *at relevant stage development commercialization* regard urgent need Vaccine end global pandemic resulting serious public health issues, restrictions personal freedoms economic impact, across world taking account efficacy safety.""

""Best Reasonable Efforts"" alone would require divert supply UK; might well prevent (depending relative seriousness pandemic different locations) export EU - i.e., full exclusivity clause, requires weigh commercial considerations decision. However, fact UK plants scope Agreement troubling AZ; i.e., opens UK plants source supply Section 5.4.

The exemption competing obligations applies contracts placed EU Member States; competing obligations would breach warranty 13.1 (e). someone US UK tell they're vaccinating stage? I'm they're still vaccinating 75 tears taste beautiful. Cry more... 

Let’s honest here. whole EU vaccine argument egg face European Commission. 

The UK funded vast majority AZ vaccine EU wants take majority don’t want buy countries can’t afford like Bulgaria Romania. 

Eat shit EU. put money in. get vaccine. infections vaccination chart page starting look beautiful. Hopefully keep spring!  does. UK's contract literally specifies AZ's UK factory meet UK's supply needs exports vaccine elsewhere.

But guess EU contracts matter EU 'stronger' UK wait big boys get around throwing scraps. thought awful failing compared rest world.

Weird everything 180'd suddenly. let thaw injecting it. 

It needs stay cold long term storage. last days refrigerator hours room temperature. loser antibodies still there, lower titer. come roaring back 2-5 days, instead 9-12 days would take mount de novo response. quite slow act first problem became quite significant. Introduce new variant bam. 4 weeks??? It’s like 4 months Seems hard argue selling capacity twice best effort... think French government gave us estimates. estimated 14 million doses Q1 equal ~93 million doses EU. COVID-19 designed eliminate costly burden old infirm. Maybe EU UK unite fight AstraZeneca together share doses instead massive conflict think coming them... key point everyone missing even EU got wanted, UK plants producing anywhere near enough (roughly 2 million doses/week) make difference shortfall. Even got every single one. 

Also, haven’t even approved Germany can’t confirm works elderly populations.

There’s logic EU’s willingness escalate tensions UK. got really nasty could lead long term trade war/maybe even violence. never listen! saying case, many people NY getting vaccinated NJ vice versa. live NJ doctor NY, get NY. Criteria say live and/or work logic vaccinate ""immunocompromised people public""? would so...handy!

Is UK part commission? 90% ? America least, commercial storefront owned managed commercial landlords. want buy building, would need large amount capital first open, isn’t feasible mom pop business.  somewhat common old window AC units Brazil ""recirculation on/off"" switch allows pulling air outside, like switch cars. statistic misleading best. many vaccinated people exposed virus? Maybe 0.04% would mean vaccine ineffective 100% exposed caught virus. ranges immunity black white. far studies indicate people (roughly 90%) signs immunity even 7-9 months post infection. could even longer enough time sure yet. 

Also remaining 10% may still level immunity hard detect. 

So least 8ish months probably longer, even long several years.

Part section Exactly. heard sime bad stories versions/ mutations. Wha- what? even say something like lost everything financially crisis, friend thought real friend, hung sooo much, night outs parties etc, guy completely disappeared ever since found fucked  Got Pfizer vaccine lot same. recommend hydrating lots get warning friends family might 100% post second dose day so. think issue many early spikes EU centralized locations medical infrastructure overwhelmed way that's harder replicate US since population much dispersed (aside New York hit really hard April). 

And world general learned lot treating COVID throughout last year also helped us perform bit better EU egregious spikes hit later (summer vs. spring). go novavax 51 percent effective south African strain 24 percent effective uk variant.

Those strains become dominant. 24 percent vaccine still get one strain 51 percent still get other. also betting effectiveness goes little every time come contact viral particles time. Yes, said ""combinations"" mutations. point whether adding K417N mutation engineered coronavirus experiments lacked would change data. Moderna data shows mutation 3 engineered coronavirus experiment caused 2.7 fold reduction. already data sources cumulative effect mutations neutralization. Yeah, message along been, Stay house 2 years hunker down. Sorry, terrible, unacceptable trade-off. Fauci. public health messaging Covid horrible.

I can't imagine case. Good! Best luck never let anti social Redditors make feel bad so. Literally read whole chapter excellent book “Spillover” shows isn’t case.  Read rabbits tried kill Australia virus.  got weaker stronger became dominant weaker variants.  way complicated factors play. doctors came work even PPE short supply. never connected willingness job effectively possible getting vaccinated. Many teachers unions bailed part person learning covid. doctors earned place line. bit chicken egg. You’re putting everyone come contact risk never get chance consent. Covid spreads even don’t symptoms, isn’t like prevent you’re sick don’t know it. You’re risking people’s lives maybe that’s ok least know cost. seen others mention it, will. Natural selection drives mutation dominant. less contagious variant never dominant simply won’t spread well other, contagious, variant. mutations completely random. mutations benefit virus, others harm, nothing. 

There false assumption deadlier virus lose battle natural selection kills sickens host fast. assumption goes window virus transmissible host pre symptomatic. Sucks, that’s nature. 

What interesting see contagious possibly severe variants impact incubation time. wonder higher viral load would make time infection symptoms shorter. case, could see scenario highly transmissible, severe variant doesn’t spread effectively burns hits people hard. Time tell. Subscribe recipe? equal parts that. funny. articles come pretext ""because new WORSE variants"" whereas reality, everyone 2 brain cells already knew cloth masks anything American 3rd place champagne. /meme least honest it. know handful people still preach us time go friends every weekend. Wow, we’re wondering get much spring maybe longer (I’m sure things ramp vaccines get approved). hope get many side effects. got second dose two days ago felt flu-like symptoms yesterday, glad sleep morning. felt lot better afternoon. I'd curious know chances happening. I'd imagine extremely small percentage people. paying attention Israel shown good evidence reducing transmission far. right far evidence vaccines reducing transmission against.  difference doctors offered vaccine first teachers keep getting pushed back. Cringe. people talk co-workers. majority peers still living life pandemic exist. lost friends leaving abusive relationship five years ago never really fully recovered that. People thought friends last years, give flying eff yet always expected offer shoulder cry smh. Welps, I'm going party umpteenth time middle pandemic living front line worker. 

My free time basically running errands kid streaming videos online. 

I want socialize pandemic finally subsides even though mean look new friends. like co-workers trust due trying throw bus work twice! Lucky. Mine giving time call first dose bc side effects, see next Wednesday get dose 2 Got first round Moderna yesterday. Injection site.is sore body aches otherwise okay. Yes, think lot people like convince pandemic ongoing. Even clusters future, variants, etc. COVID stay, guess types never rejoining society? experience health clinic people got moderna got symptoms ranging mild fever 103, got pfizer zero minimal side effects. suppose would need “age adjusted deaths per capita” thing I've getting lot thanks people vaccinate, sweet, honestly absolutely love vaccinating people. feels good able it. essential workers already know society considers disposable, past year proof proof that. virus, like many viruses, seasonal. We’re seeing seasonality kick right now, thank goodness. talk mom getting yesterday. She’s “worried long term effects”. told enough people getting end turning us purple killing us planet fucked anyways. got moderna 2nd dose next Wednesday. call work gave chills sweats after, arm hurts sooooo much. Yep math. 
US 10x population.
10 x 24,000 = 240,000.
240,000/1,500,000 x 100 = 16%.
So we've vaccinated 16% per capita US has. sure that's suppose make feel better?  seen lot people *recommending* two masks, saying hypothetically, extra layer effective. Like cotton mask 1 layer versus one 2 3.

Do it, it, one's trying make you. Personally, see bothering unless high-risk situation (like, I'm symptomatic need ride ER)  Well sure, point death ratio shot incredibly low compared disease. well documented instances viral illnesses triggering auto-immune diabetes auto-immune conditions. much researchers think vaccines (like flu) help save genetically predisposed people triggered type-1 diabetes. doubly stupid take vaccine.  #RULE BRITANNIA Yes it’s basically never happened Brazilian variant going one that's going absolutely fuck us. Here's hoping people read article headline. Yeah, it’s worse, whole lot worse. work allowing anyone take next 2 days free PTO need 2nd. economy booming (stock market speculation, fact US major industrial power **not** ravaged WWI). also lot parties. MERKA Wow that’s interesting. know what’s even fun? Following public safety protocols.

This little reminder double-mask leave essentials, sea otters stay home otherwise, save lives. SCARY new variants virus emerging. together 💯 forcing state's hand something want happen

They're anything besides asking state reconsider. do, date negotiated. Might wanna plan career shift there. Though understand desire work lot way move better things. want pursue path involve 5 years nonstop studying. Actually, forget everything said, see California. probably minority teachers their. Every part pandemic mismanaged state, schools different? Wow that’s interesting. know what’s even fun? Following public safety protocols.

This little reminder double-mask leave essentials, sea otters stay home otherwise, save lives. SCARY new variants virus emerging. together 💯 idea you’re downvoted. certainly depends state you’re it’s pretty much shitshow around here.

Whatever somehow get people rallying around #1 vaccinations they’ll freaking get shots? Fine. Yay we’re number 1. much work do. Can't wait new variants fuck us put us back square one next year more. avoided New York-level meltdown rose standard already. dipped level fast went lower New York's meltdown level.  Bullshit then

You would able travel return NSW time suspect folks diagnosed anxiety disorder suffering subclinical anxiety disorder, pandemic could proverbial straw broke camel's back, either bringing symptoms surface breaking old coping mechanisms. Elsewhere general population, hard say. snows Northern California too.

California tall state. Agreed, there's nowhere world I'd rather right now.  know plan transition ""no COVID anywhere"" ""we've got enough people vaccinated open borders stop tracking everyone's movements""... still, great problem have. Literally like 25 days go today tried combo KF94 bandana seal gaps beard. knew I'd hit upon winner wife picked takeout way home. said something good smelled, masks smelled nothing. Good.

Better get countries. one able jump line profession irrelevant. Old people highest risk pure selfishness take turn. Ya want stay home work feel uncomfortable, that's ok totally choice maybe even smart, expect replaced. Well always shoots numbers way back again...let’s patient finish right doesn’t start again. Go eat cookie wait turn Parents power think. going end whining job. People going put computer school 3 academic years kids lives, enrollment falls, jobs. 


 Also, please know, absolutely minority profession. Like said above, wife teacher 16 years. one teacher I've talked wants stay classroom giving kids subpar education. 

Which, segues next point: Zoom school way 'alternative' class instruction. honestly shocks that, teacher, think does. That’s nyc subreddit summer. Almost one testing positive usual response literally anything opening “BUT WE’LL RIGHT BACK STARTED” people fuck think I'm going put two masks lmao. wear one that's plenty.

I'm also willing bet people wearing two masks January DC COLD. Yeah relationships grow stronger one ""it's time double mask"" can't even get people wear one. know mean well good job. Like many aspects COVID, think know yet. 
Personally, 20s one chronic condition, feel keen risking another. course, that's judgment call everyone makes themselves, can't help feel lot people totally risks serious illness never actually truly, severely ill. suspicion going major shortage healthcare workers soon exit crisis mode. It’s nonstop wartime triage year they’re running fumes, probably PTSD, little show it. would guess sense duty thing keeping lot going, could see mass exodus saving world isn’t solely responsibility.  know it'll super-spreader event state health officials warns you. Los Angeles worried Tampa Bay. Yep, they're screwed. yup, that’s try tell parents. unfortunately think they’re selfish vaccinated somehow protecting themselves? anyways, i’m glad i’m minor anymore able get vaccinated (healthcare). I'm proud working one subcontracting companies making bit vaccine :D discussion seems lot less useful Novavax results, test _all_ SA mutations therefore addressed  concern  creating VSV-based SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses contain   individual mutations  well  one  8 mutations  B.1.1.7 variant (UK∆8) another 9 mutations B.1.351 variant (SA∆9).

The ""total"" mutations row _first_ row variant.  I’m expert I’m afraid. think something spike proteins better get cells infect you. I’d read say anything concrete.

&amp;#x200B;

In case think masks matter hand washing. seem though helping symptoms still need time wait see bad gets course. much better others household may gotten last worst still come. New Zealand endless lockdown? Lmfao they're hosting rugby matches sold stadiums. give date agree absurd? say plan without reasonable alternative plan amicable compromise negotiation 101. Otherwise forcing state's hand something want happen (no vaccine, force date) likely look bad public's eye obstinate. really find hard believe 30% US population got infected, less much got infected Mexico US anywhere near bad Mexico Might want /s buddy good portion US since April.

FTFY clear, I'm complaining. We're living lot closer normal life Australia people world now.  11 days since locally transmitted infection, country-wide.  There's nowhere I'd rather be. lives still changed:

* 14-day quarantine government-monitored hotel required entering country. practice, limited capacity quarantine system resulted massive cuts flights country, limiting ability citizens return home
* citizens permanent residents currently allowed leave country without applying exemption (with good reason, like dying relative overseas) government, may find unable return do
* scan QR code using government app track movements condition entry businesses. enables contact tracing case outbreak
* States opening closing borders basis single-digit locally acquired infections per day, meaning loss freedom movement even *within* country.


But time... restaurants open, malls open, bars open, masks recently went ""required indoors"" ""strongly recommended indoors"", hospital COVID wards empty (&lt; 100 active cases, including overseas arrivals), generally live lives without fear getting infected.  go beach worry person next coughs.

Nobody seems know, though, we're going transition ""we've eliminated COVID within borders"" ""a sufficient number people vaccinated, we're worried infected people arriving anymore""... We've approved Pfizer vaccine can't manufacture pre-purchased limited amount.  government seems hung hats AstraZeneca, since *can* manufactured seem quite cozy current government. absolutely want meet patients transferred hospitals across country. Corona likes travel.

Absolutely insane. health minister background whatsoever medical sciences. Honestly, need marketers working alongside public health officials.

Marketers realize campaign messages work terms driving revenue volume. campaign messages don't.

When message work --- dumb enough (unless want get fired) say ""well, message great! peoples fault great message resonate them! Let's keep using message!"" Nah. Pornhub live weirdo  Wait, mean stuff order Amazon, Grubhub, Instacart doesn’t magically appear door? ranking accounts current restrictions, like mentioned post. Learn read. Good luck Read study!!

The region UNIT! two units aka hospitals. One high altitude Quito, LOW altitude, 7 hours drive away Guayaquil. Participants lived locally city (region local hospital - anywhere entire country.)  I've worn two since beginning easy do. Two best friends named Karen Kevin... may started this. married.  government taking time ensure vaccine safe. Pfizer vaccine recently approved, vaccination supposed begin February. seems like hurry, considering almost cases here, sure safety vaccine priority.  , maybe not.

Thank Mr. Science. Thats coming from? Lol. genuinely confused last part crucial think. opportunity people hold onto whatever terms lives. friends dreading social obligations work again- aren’t even introverted autistic... like choosing spend evenings weekends with. 

I sincerely hope people walks life best set boundaries respect time space. Employers functioning fine without extra bs, there’s really excuse trying dominate time. They’ll probably say something ignorant like

.04 percent chance get virus .04 chance killing you. Without understanding numbers represent different outcomes Idk. East Coast pretty good since implementing mandatory masks people abiding. 

We’re seeing biggest surges places strictly adhere mask wearing, find. agree. think tools available today make poor right now. However find mostly fault poor non standardized response whole pandemic. mean zoom crap platform teaching end story.

Anyways feel government put bid platform actually worked could something better real issue shit mute controls ability break manageable discussion groups. Maybe raise hand option.

I mean course kids pay attention etc responsibility must lie kid/parent. vaccine tested efficacy? think headline misleading all. 

You'll always get group people misunderstand something. 

Just there's percentage line word vaccine, mean anyone consider effectiveness URL *next month* ??? Brain damage ... would explain lot Karen / Kevin videos. Sorry hear that! wife gets one tomorrow I'm driving her. Hopefully get one well not, understand. You’re getting downvoted every expert I’ve listened including fauci extremely concerned possibility. Iowa already seen percent hospitalized starting drop since started giving 

There's early cracks showing know look know Pfizer Moderna vaccines effective South Africa variant? Exactly - sad way society views itself; value comes working, making money, stimulating economy, value come connections others, relationships, etc. They're ones made decision place condition receiving vaccines, teachers asking governor consider changing it. letter says nothing talking extensively overburdened workers. 2025.... Yup. Oxford shares equal blame here. first trial theirs, screw AZ take US trial. I'd say overwhelming evidence Pfizer prevent transmission lot. Let's see ones do. No, covid-19 viral particles exactly parent (just ONE parent, parents, viruses sexual reproduction). mutations occur time time. total number covid-19 mutations exist today large enormous number covid-19 particles existed world pandemic. (At least hundred million people infected, maybe 10 billion viral particles one person peak infection, total number covid-19 viral particles existed far pandemic well 1 billion times 1 billion.)

Most mutations cause change ability virus function (by infecting human cells replicating). mutations make virus less able function, mutations die quickly. mutations, combinations mutations, improve ability virus infect human cells. mutations (or combinations), beneficial virus bad us, ""variants"" starting hear lot about. 1,000 legit issues 22M = 0.0045%. BOARD! mean heck, I’m likely die car wreck commuting work bc “essential” cannot work home (lol, don’t qualify get shot yet either). 

Someone said cancer? you’re age older (and female), you’re likely develop cervical cancer contracting HPV virus bc vaccine didn’t exist teen. Also add, hospitals probably safest place. They’re clean protocol strict it’s easy get sick covid hospital right now. Schools gross. don’t sanitary procedures hospitals. Plus parents send kids sick school alllll time need go work. It’s ridiculous. I'm gonna pissed get worse symptoms vaccine virus. LOL would heck lot better frail, 83yr old scientist people sick of. Thanks laugh. I've double masking N95 cotton cover since started. difficult single mask. many truly exposed COVID? Impossible know. still likely observed mask wearing/social distancing even getting vaccine. one said that. You’re either lying paying attention. said reopening depends rates falling, number vaccinated. vaccinating everyone rates fall.  excluded? understand comment. We've paying far per person support medical industry advancements, seems right hatch dividend. Reminds Little Red Hen fable. This. problem. Grocery stores example tend better ventilation people spread out. Kids classroom? every seen bad adhering cover mouth sneezing, smear sneezes everything, etc etc works! States opening closing borders basis single-digit locally acquired infections per day, meaning loss freedom movement even within country.

This really key. China Australia large countries stop local outbreaks becoming national outbreaks, STRICT internal controls movement how. controversial/unthinkable even something see suggested, benefit hindsight, done early pandemic. Currently one who’s LongHauler risk vaccine worth binary die live there’s middle ground... that’s bit like hell. Hey. think authorizes changing tens thousands vaccines go state, janitor? That's decision made top-most level planned entire upper public health vaccination apparatus. know people planning local clinics 12+ hour days 7-days week since month first vaccines dropped. rightfully understand productive humanly possible getting vaccines arms gets people killed, work appropriately. hardly think us congratulated. people miss this? It’s obvious.  Va. got dose today. It’s second week teacher vaccinations. know variant building communities? Exactly like first wave. Watch nursing homes workplace outbreaks please remember see hospitalization people already spawned 2 generations covid proof arrived proof everywhere. like before, wear kn95 avoid crowds small rooms others. I’m school based speech pathologist everyone media lately says schools must absolutely remain open. we’re told we’re dumb selfish eating out, seeing family friends, going patio bar, etc. it’s ok workers exposed daily others society benefit yet can’t enjoy anything life. True.

I'm dead serious say --- new President needs find someone (1) popular (2) non-partisan CoronaVirus press conferences face PR campaign. Someone literally would appear every couple days reinforce messaging simple effective ways. Someone like, say, Rock.

In way it’s kind lifesaver mentally. sad many people think slaving away working someone else ""essential,"" seeing friends family love hold dear ""not essential"" result told part pandemic. News wise, NOTHING going on. So, networks going give virus play right now. invasion capitol happened, hear lot Covid talk. Tune visit respectable news sources. Ditto here. got Pfizer one. roughly side effects 12 hour mark 36 hour. neck still little stiff napping weird positions.
PSA make sure sippy cup water, plenty blankets, nothing planned day 2nd shot California’s push “equitable” vaccine reason rollout slow, less streamlined process behind state fall vaccinations Australia dodge it. completely eliminated multiple states multiple times.

New Zealand multiple hotel quarantine leaks they've brought control stopped. I've traveled Asia, people wore time loved it. US, even flu season, I've felt self conscious/judged put mask doctor's office provided. truly hope keep mask-wearing pandemic, least hospitals places like that. think would help flu season lot. vast majority people left protect point people want anyone's protection first place.

Exactly. reality is, reasonable people can't asked forever carry unreasonable members society comes pandemic. vaccine widespread, becomes like flu vaccine me. get flu shot every year spend time worrying anti-vaxxers refuse get flu shot. They're own. Bad news: screwed pooch big time containing it

Good news: many people exposed natural immunity might meet vaccines middle get numbers bottomed sooner Added twist. precursor chemicals needed Pfizer vaccine (manufactured Belgium) made UK. EU blocks export vaccine UK shut completely.  That's style though. enjoys spotlight. Remember ""First Pitch"" throw Washington Nationals game? lol man may great scientist belongs lab public stage.   happens symptoms mostly caused immune reaction. Generally speaking, exposed reaction milder. stronger immunity reaction immune system prompt severe.

I would take strong reaction second shot positive indicator personal efficacy although i'm sure reliable is. No.

Clause 5.4 refer AZ using best reasonable efforts establish manufacturing facilities EU UK. However, Clause 5.1 (which relevant provision regarding actual delivery vaccine doses), refers doses manufactured within EU (and UK). basically commitment AZ deliver doses outside EU global scale, no. Holding back vaccines keeping still helping people. It’s redistribution vaccines. Holding back vital ingredients make dent amount vaccines produced, actually make people die disease. doesn't.

Clause 5.4 refer AZ using best reasonable efforts establish manufacturing facilities EU UK. However, Clause 5.1 (which relevant provision regarding actual delivery vaccine doses), refers doses manufactured within EU (and UK). basically commitment AZ deliver doses outside EU Agreed, critical time now, 3 months. New variants coming parts world, need virus crushed gets control. 

Variants able take hold quick enough. Q2 late. Given AZ signed UK contract prior EU contract could conceivably seen fraud read clause 5.4 ""manufacturing sites"", explicitly states include UK Yes does, need look 5.1, post misunderstood voted clause 5.4 apply case  worry. Israel pretty big control group... everyone get Pfizer vaccine though. everything going, get get. Also, I'm pretty sure preliminary studies say one thing, Pfizer fully committed saying vaccine effective vs South African variant yet, said 86% UK variant.

Early evidence suggests one thing, always proceed optimistic caution.  Haha no... makes think that. immunity / vaccine way point. scientist supposed give facts data based science entertainer. opinion herd immunity based science regardless hard predict, based people want hear point time. lot healthcare workers unfortunately wrongly passing vaccine.  Same. want everybody shot give anybody shows run out. still, replies aggressive quite self righteous.

""I'll pretend rude hide fact lying whole time"".

Please, piling bad faith top misinformation. black skeptics frontline hcws massive overlap. 

Either way, one dose. Massive benefit, little downside. realize countries also within Israel's borders.  idea getting at. provide data supports saying? Sorry know severe symptoms? agree upmost importance become trade war. ideal scenario everyone wears them, protect other. Yes it’s bit futile I’m person wearing one No, Palestinians they're government Israel responsibility vaccinate (just like Russian vaccinate polish people).

There vaccinating protocol west Bank, hamas said buy vaccines Russia, happen yet.

Yes Israeli Arabs Israeli citizens like Israeli jews, get full access Israeli Healthcare benefits.

I work ""Makabi"" (Israeli basic health service) corona testing tel Aviv, lots Israeli Arabs come welcome so. Oh blocking vaccine shipments would produced isn't?

I agree, look ways. sides killing people start vaccine trade wars let's hope come that. 65+ year olds right around corner vaccinated right depending jurisdiction + black frontline workers convince. Id argue one dose going Tyler Perry good convinces people current phases get jab. like Global North Australia New Zealand exactly northern either...  would result chain reaction stems EU (potentially) disrupting supply chain. relevant case az could fulfill capacity order due manufacturing, competing agreement. wonder vaccine getting like 1/10th traction Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca Johnson &amp; Johnson getting. easy transport, easy manufacture, got data that's way solid AstraZeneca's, shows impressive protection UK variant decent/good protection South African variant (even though South Africa data barely statistically significant.  I’m going look quickly Ministry health website see there’s something Hebrew discusses hospitalizations individuals infected fully vaccinated. isn’t something yet, probably something next weeks. new variants become dominant US, America able contain easily right? I'm hoping disaster happened Manaus, Brazil happen US. We’re this. We’re giving every dose relying promises governor get second doses time. would still need majority people vaccinated. think mask mandates go away late 2021. need first Q. 2nd Q late. approved 90 minutes, wont relevant anymore Due job loss moved back home country Canada hell theories come sudden? 

The issue now, would receive vaccines, UK restricting export theirs, EU threatening Pfizer vaccines. vaccines still there, matter end up, people saved. talk restricting export ingredients manufacturing vaccines pure evil. would killing people, redistributing gets saved. Batshit insane even talked about, matter happened now. Yeah, Sweden big surprise this. crock shit. We've spent last year dicking around crying wearing masks, we're going 'crush' virus? Yeah fucking right lmao team researchers discovered two chemical compounds block novel coronavirus replicating--potentially major milestone development new drugs fight Results test tube experiment show chemical compounds identified little toxicity effective combined existing remedy, according team led scientists National Center Global Health research paper published British scientific journal Nature Communications Jan. 28, following website:  disagree. 

The obligation 5.4 covers manufacture Vaccine. Vaccine defined ""ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine"" ""Initial Europe Doses"" subset Vaccine (as per Recitals).

But would smarter clearer drafted meaning EU include UK throughout clause 5 5.4. Good thing economy contract 2020 then. Oh wait. That's part problem. working like that. choice, union representation, alternate job options. going work unsafely, time vaccines made available many people situation time lag might mean difference life death. Instead lobbying government get support, carry business period, taking risk advocating others same.

The teachers willing take chance get fired. They'll options, there's enough country. get paid well enough relative education demand services means work long. Rather take stand them, many workers willing either ignore risk accept it, realize options available afterward.

It's sad. conflict AstraZeneca, UK. AFAIK said going block Pfizer exports make AZ shortfall, seems moment intention block AZ exports.

I agree would terrible look block Pfizer exports AZ unable meet commitments Maybe, conspiracy theory territory, UK contract at-cost. AZ making big fat profit UK vaccines might inclined give first. EU vaccines non-profit, might feel quite enthusiastic provide them.

I mean workers slacking, supply chain decided holding purse strings, supply goes UK buddies first greasing wheels bit more. Oxford Vaccine though. literally case ""We give details produce this, dont make profit"" It’s really nothing. people don’t even feel thing, surprised it’s over. EU hiding?

Because they've redacted exact figures AZ contract they've released. lot firm answers lot arrows pointing bad directions. 

The main question seems populations question hit infection rate 60% 70% rise cases consistent would expect see previously unexposed people get infected. 
Answering first question yes is.... alarming. Mass reinfection would concern whole world. Answering would also bad. hoping yes. starting sound like math equation.

Two three answers good sadly third answer gotten far used to.  friend lives EU UK citizen. Biden placed travel restriction non US citizen EU country. However, person get travel exemption work (work train race athlete). person flown US visit 3 states roughly month. Isn’t shit fucked? Wrong clause, doesn't. Maybe UK start putting vaccine ham sandwiches? Well still actually approved way knowing that. really think going get vaccines nuts. UK government order Oxford revoke license EU really to, gets one anywhere.

Vaccine nationalism incredibly pointless best cases case targeting company sold vaccine cost. also spent 3 months longer contract UK deal throwing tantrum vaccines ready. UK supposed 30 million September 2020 got 0.5 million end year. 

Now even approved largest risk group - 65s. demanding UK stop vaccinating give less at-risk groups. PR disaster - alienating much UK. Israel, Canada US also receive vaccines them. go ahead threat ban exports unprecedented geo-political blunder. scotland new zealand would like word think one lawyers. wording phrased way doses made EU purposes contract includes UK.

AZ would inform EU doses made outside EK/UK. really say doses made UK sent EU shortfall.

It's Section 5.4.  Retail pharmacist giving vaccines 2 weeks now. Yes, every location epi-pens injectable diphenhydramine part protocol. live Northeast coast. 100+ &amp; 100% Gunfire norm high summer. That's exactly say 98 lovely day shade, know first hand.

I also used live Charleston SC. same.  contract backs key EU claims UK plants used manufacturing contract countries impede part scale-up, AstraZeneca committed use Best Reasonable Efforts (as defined below) build capacity manufacture 300 million Doses Vaccine, profit loss Reasonable Efforts” means

“Drug product manufacturing REDACTED (ITL), REDACTED (DE), REDACTED (UK) potential suppliers”.**
 obligation, contractual otherwise, Person third party respect Initial Europe Doses conflicts inconsistent material respect terms Agreement would impede complete fulfillment obligations book ghostwritten nipple rings. Actually Israeli, I’m personally super concerned numbers positive tests coming places low vaccination rates (because population cooperative). Also need referral get tested meaning we’re testing people want tested, going drive test positivity rate (it jumped 2% referrals became requirement )


This [Coronavirus (use Google Chrome translate) notice certain areas (Ultra orthodox Arab towns) extremely low vaccination rates compared rest country. low vaccination rates translated high case counts. also see breakdown infected, majority infected, people either yet eligible vaccinated became eligible vaccinated past week.  That's true. 5.1 refers doses manufactured EU. issue preference. Simple that.  think interpretation enough ambiguity Astrazeneca argue contract use EU manufacturing sites (excluding uk) initial doses. UK contract EU contract?

If EU contract said contract says receive doses UK export doses EU? would taking pettiness morally ambiguous decisions whole new level. Restricting vital vaccine ingredients would straight killing people. Sorry, thought literally provided one source, lot unsupported commentary. literally proving honest statement alone.

Apologies, thought linked BBC along short, source admits different doses accident.

You right there, going didn’t know dose was, wouldn’t accidental. expecting full dose, suppose make accident.

But still, replies aggressive quite self righteous. 

I merely trying point Oxford team don’t consider botched trial, neither general consensus UK. also pointing Oxford ran trial AstraZeneca. 

I think discussions like important help challenge views (such own) corrections they’re due. issue that, good proposition. cdc says wear mask, social distance, avoid crowds. It’s strictly wear masks PA added smokers obese 1A. Teachers grocery store workers 1B can’t get yet. fair. Clause 5.1 states ""Initial Europe doses"" (the first 300m) produced ""within EU"".   Yes, there’s potential ripple effect someone gets infected. month ago infected 2 people, people infected 2 people, on, one month later I’m fine longer sick, ripple effect infection could still going throughout population. they're saying use EU businesses much possible production vaccine. completely irrelevant point.  Understandable, celebrity support much needed; but, reason needs NOW, still frontline healthcare workers dire need vaccine - demand vaccine FAR outnumbers supply? skip line right now, could receive it, say, 2 months turn? Wouldn’t much effect boosting confidence vaccine - confidence systems place making sure vaccines distributed fairly equitably? Sign also cancer 93. ""which means temperature changes winter summer months negligible effect viral spread"" - exactly observe around world. We've observed first hand Poland, spread extremely correlated schools open weather. Thank you. mean yes 90% efficiency doubt better 60% main aim right prevention people going hospital dying. mind much developing covid symptoms aslong vaccine stops going hospital end day that's clear win book.  does. Best reasonable effort used 15 times throughout contract.

Its good look Commission  It’s likely percentage lower general population also studied people study 60+. Vaccines known less effective people older fully vaccinated younger people studied it’s likely lower percent actually get sick. purpose interviews appeal public, make scientific decision, solid percentage something impossible certain perfectly reasonable. talk bad Ruthless is? thedailybeast.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* think committed keeping together - statistically significantly different, would treated differently. (the lower limit confidence interval LD/SD overlapped upper limit SD/SD), conclude dosage made difference. decided, one 70% efficacy result, need decide dosage approve - efficacy results make difference decision, look different significant, went larger trial/initial plan/whatever reasons had. 

So LD/SD was, say, 20% (CI 10-30), they'd conclude significantly worse SD/SD discarded. Similarly, LD/SD dosage 85 95, would said enough data know better SD/SD approved. 

Where see Pfizer Moderna data? I've seen AZ published far! published Lancet. maybe I've missed it. **Purpose** section 5.4 define manufacturing sites whole contract. includes 5.1 still done yet? waiting 5pm something. 66% effective better effectiveness. great news. help us get pandemic control terms deaths hospitalisation. reason right now. That's rule. Far it. vaccines less effective UK SA variants infectious lethal. I'm questioning J&amp;J proposed 1 dose solution much better Moderna Pfizer.  run parallel trials see better?

J&amp;J seem interested marketing 1 dose solution effective vaccine. fact going 2-3 months behind inferior vaccine means lost game. 58% effective Brazilian strain already US now, whereas Pfizer Moderna claim nearly resistance. He’s 51. There's huge moral difference blocking exports countries commit time resources (this US/UK did), versus waiting till countries begin production stealing vaccines.

Imagine backlash Trump let Canada secure contracts supplies begin producing vaccines US, stole investment.

Somehow EU seems think acceptable??? Use Outline.com useful, hope helps Ebro too. KastOne goof talking nonsense. please post sources legal commentary

also would say AZ agrees UK facilities excluded, defense always talks ""best efforts"" wording, never 5.1 clause

EU signed contract together US(august).

Japan signed nothing.

Canada may buy vaccine US(good neighbor) UK(Queen queen).

In opinion random internet person, definitely get vaccine ASAP, order better protect can't it. infections happen outside working places. (Exception Health Care professionals). Many people, specially younger people still like socialise friends relatives despite pandemic situation. 

Where get information? get stronger one later you’re already going wait Lol aggressive? genuinely confused meant.

so think reasonable upset AZ upholding contract Huh? standard? WTF?!@#$ bit concerning.

possibly 50%+ effective variant trying stop? would call success. booster created help provide protection new variants moving forward, like flu. don’t think “called out,” don’t problem it. providing context comment. 

I didn’t “attack nowhere.” Dude decided smug vaccine. I'm actually surprised. at, flu vaccines children encouraged? overzealously vaccinating, although flu may cause death children immune conditions, rare children die flu?

Where live (EU) flu vaccinations ""officially"" ""Anyone age 6 months diabetes chronic disease of, example, heart, lungs (severe asthma COPD), liver, kidneys muscles. children reduced resistance due another disease treatment."" Nope turns EU right along.

However, protection expected, given immune response seen age group based experience vaccines; reliable information safety population, EMA’s scientific experts considered vaccine used older adults. information expected ongoing studies, include higher proportion elderly participants.

I'm aggressive asking question, that's literally response needs used anyone doubting getting vaccine.

We simply can't put people ""feeling"" like want get vaccine. know you, dying pretty good thing me... mean, care. want lung organ damage higher risk dementia. don’t think that’s plan It’s pretty common, sad. **purpose** section, **section**.

What could purpose be? Hint: titled **Manufacturing Sites** kind seems like really one dose vaccine — really different two dose ones, decided use one dose. Teachers get infected roughly 300% rate normal populace. 

That’s fucking safe. hypothetical. People jump former president like close country. closed travel China cries racism.  Imagine shut California New York executive decree. 
I voted Biden I’m glad Trump gone. doesn’t eliminate fact we’re literally everybody concerned certain Tuesday November. Cases bad, bad enough go hospital.

Without those, EU would dead five years. article, Alabama one 4 states count different, near top there’s another reason states might high, low, Alabama, testing counted many individuals get tested, rather counting test used. It’s one four states way, according data compiled COVID Tracking Project. three South Dakota, Idaho Kansas - also near top positivity rate. Several states - including Pennsylvania Iowa, partially report testing data example, healthcare worker Birmingham could get tested week, data would enter Alabama’s system once. difference reporting could mean states’ testing numbers undercounted.

Give Novavax. want j&amp;j vaccine used essential workers though, seems nothing preventing transmission spoiled Moderna Pfizer numbers. Now, everyone expects types numbers vaccines.  Here's latest case/death charts El Paso, running 7-day county 247.48 deaths per 100k population, almost twice US average. ranks 430th per capita deaths I've lost lot respect people social circle last 12 months.

 Even I'll time science denying friends family exposed selves this. Imagine trying argue words ""purpose section 5.4 only"" includes section 5.1. Wow. 0.04% people vaccinated. pretty useless statistic. love y’all paint death complete health. 

Do intend ignore long term effects?

Also UN rights list isn’t effected anything lockdowns currently. Quit cherry-picking.

OH get it. There's least level concern they're selection bias makes 75% immunity estimate bit overestimate since used blood donors knew could get free covid antibody test way. 

In case, evidence variants elicit less effective immune response post previous infection vaccine nothing thing --there's still immune response vaccines far seem produce stronger immune response natural infections. I'm totally sure new variant unleashes concern pandemic reset start over; knowledge, technology, immunity we've developed going revert Jan 2020 levels. I'm pretty sure EU block export Canada country, unless suspect country received doses already bought EU (like UK apparently did).

The main issue AstraZeneca production issues (which expected), decided prioritize customers (UK) heavily customers (EU) instead cutting everyone's supply similar way, contract.

The EU blocking exports. EU monitoring exports see AstraZeneca continues prioritize UK way contract.

So countries vaccine export ban right US UK. Here's latest case/death stats Alabama, running 7-day good.

Death rate drop, open completely everybody exposed. Got good vaccine? Lucky. Got one inferior ones? Well roll dice mate, enjoy 20+ possible chronic effects.  I'd take right now! think would love over, but, let’s honest - far fastest science ever able react pandemic scale vaccine quickly.

The Spanish Flu pandemic 1918 didn’t vaccine even developed, much less distributed, 1942.

Instead complaining - thankful didn’t wait 22 years total solution. one popular Presidents recent history. 

That's... works America get option. 😭 title severely misleading  right idea. reason Portugal getting screwed right left travel open UK. UK variant soon make 60% total cases deaths cases per capita highest world. No. export Pfizer materials. doesn't. specifically says 5.4 only. Stop spreading lie throughout post. percentage Israelis got sick without vaccine? stat useful without information. never understood articles. plenty online dating apps there. meet someone like, get tested wait weeks. tests negative, start banging! Trying lower number overall cases virus stops mutating faster vaccinate it. hospitals. want keep many people getting infected possible. me. I'm sure getting 66% effective would help peace mind all. getting 95% effective could game changer mentally. I'd wait feel safer. Lmao seen data 65s. huge mess. confidence interval effectiveness like -1400% 80%. Yes, confidence interval huge could fucking negative thousand percent. That's good question. remember saw/heard this, think said ready starting shipping March assuming get EUA then. really dislike movies image often portrays black people... mean basically modern day minstrel show. 

But amazing thoughtful person many reasons done much good many communities hard dislike him. i've advised make concrete statements data support claims, probably try answer this, heh. 

personally would going around people known active covid cases, traveling plane, etc prefer err side caution, seem like goggles face shields advised general public even prior vaccines. guarantee it'll specifically prevent death. people got COVID 19 getting vaccine either mild symptoms severe symptoms never got bad enough kill them. ""best reasonable effort"" certainly mean forcing companies break existing legal contracts. Lmao that’s scientifically true all. do. purpose manufacturing sites, EU includes UK (see section 5.4)

Furthermore, Page substance manufacturing XXX (FR/BE), XXX(I/IL), **XXX(UK), XXX(UK)**, XXX(ITL) missed whole year half life. I’m going accept less affective vaccine time effort I’ve put stating home almost 24/7 year. mean really? I’m supposed happy I’m offered vaccine isn’t good? I’m 22. I’m fucking tired able go things 22 year olds able to. shit shut recently turned 21, pissed end miss last year college, first year legal drinking age. don’t care rant selfish. I’ve nothing selfless entire pandemic I’m told reward missing year half life, get 66% effective vaccine others getting 85% effective one? Bullshit. two three months number called (waiting 300k+ snowbirds 65+ get vaccinated state going home home states late spring), I’m fortunately position make choice. 

To clear, think great option areas don’t support Pfizer Moderna infrastructure. It’s that, assuming choice, I’m going effective vaccine available me. don’t think anyone begrudge that, it’s frustrating people make assumption grateful inferior product superior one absolutely one given. 

Maybe it’s selfish, I’m willing isolate bit longer better outcome. Recovered, shown symptoms, positive test, absolutely fine. scroll actually read conversation jumping into, you’ll notice nothing close described occurred feel bad Canada, they've thrown elbows entire time. Hopefully J&amp;J vaccine loosen US supply demands allow extra supply shifted Canada. right attitude. reason COVID folks sweating severity levels compared something like H1N1 flu much higher. bring cases virtually severe issues deaths paper tiger virus. Holiday season spike over, js all. back right Thanksgiving spike... theory, yes. hard smaller parties compete systems.

Unless Brazil different average English-speaking country respect, money game theory would severely hamper chances third-party candidate winning election. Even countries presidential run-off elections, events like recent French election exception rather rule. actually huge issue many people aware of. guys sum pretty well, TLDR imo comparing states data individual trackers apples oranges without accounting different data definitions. J&amp;J vax useless variants Sigh... Well agrees AZ clearly right contractually community spread started two options - total elimination la China, virus runs course. pattern among US states per capita deaths compared social distancing severity, states really well isolated like Wyoming Hawaii. Every state total hodgepodge, states severe restrictions well average states almost restrictions average (and visa versa course). Yeah, embarrassing sentiment part world. safe highly efficacious (86%) vaccine China's production capacities unrivaled. kind discrimination present Sputnik vaccine first. China Russia ones supplying middle- lower-income countries, thankfully. Question double masking: variants dangerous initial covid-19? we're encouraged double mask? public accepting masks, authorities feel like people listen add another layer protection?

I'm totally pro-mask btw. wanted know reasoning behind push double masks now, compared initial ask last year

Thanks! “The people immune virus, broad stroke virus, harder virus spread person person. Therefore, harder develop new variants. make harder able find someone infect, going decrease likelihood see one variants.” Sounds like COVID least problems then. :) may work administers that’s realistic long term storage solution including manufacturers &amp; suppliers. Also shipping requirements vaccines much lower temps wait til shine UV light ass, you’ll transcending deity status OR, lets give live saving medicine countries already approved full month ago instead letting sit shelf vague future time EU might approve it. Fair point. list countries read expecting deliveries Belgium plant. Novavax released results 89% overall, 95% original variant, 85% new UK variant. exactly agree 5.4 clarify 5.1 respect manufacturing ? Citation please. 80M doses Pfizer Moderna arrive end September, anyone’s expectation normality September still stands. vaccines approved (I.e, Novavax, J&amp;J) speed bit.

Elderly lady spoke said pain sleeping shoulder. That’s it.  Right we're around [1 million per source. Links please? know 66% 44,000+ people actually going moderate severe cases begin with?

You don’t need know percentage study group going moderate severe control group comparing vaccinated group control group (no vaccine).

So divide 44,000 people two groups. One group gets vaccine, group gets placebo. end study compare numbers control group vs. vaccinated group. 100 people group developed moderate/severe COVID, vaccine would zero percent effective. 100 people control group developed moderate/severe COVID one vaccine group does, would 100 percent effective. trial, 66 percent fewer people trial group developed severe moderate COVID control group.

It’s also important point definition JJ used “moderate” COVID less severe disease many picturing. Moderate COVID defined study Moderate COVID-19 disease defined laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 one following: evidence pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis, shortness breath abnormal blood oxygen saturation 93%, abnormal respiratory rate (≥20); two systemic symptoms suggestive COVID-19.

The systemic symptoms are: Fever, cough, sore throat, myalgia, fever, chills, headache, diarrhea. tested positive, body aches chills days, recovered fully, “moderate” case study. little nuts it, gloves bit much example. always rinsed groceries lol washed hands? hope Severe would like walking pneumonia. technically breathe oxygen level technically low. feel like hell weeks don’t need hospitalized. don’t know means. I’m going get whatever vaccine available whenever I’m eligible get it. [Yes problem covid flu even mild cases. mild case two months ago I'm still recovering clear damage caused stomach, heart lungs. I'm sure I'll fully heal year (since mild) viral damage joke. recent study done even people asymptomatic (but tested positive) ended loads lung scar tissue.

It's odd disease. it, never felt sick ""classical"" way. really hit like cold even flu. like organs inexplicably working like normally do, gets bad get feverish/delirious. Stomach suddenly extremely nauseous half day fine. Suddenly breath needing calculate every movement every breath feel like getting enough oxygen. Debilitating brain fog. Chest pains. Etc. mild could still feel damage causing. Personally, would take vaccine 57% effective soon likely dominant strain absolute last resort. way. I've planning trip Egypt 5 consecutive years. FIVE. Every single year someone cancelled bogus excuses. finally last year, graduating masters, supposed treat trip Egypt sister, planned paid for. pandemic started. guess Egypt never meant be. nothing click bait bullshit. Canada, Big Brother USA EU gets first.

But least Canada get early year. rest world wait line top even infights other. AZ beaten court best efforts clause.  

Travellers returning overseas take COVID-19 test airport land quarantine designated hotel three days expense await results.

Those negative test results able quarantine remainder mandatory two weeks home, positive tests required quarantine designated government facilities.  Agreed. also perfect vaccine still skeptical mRNA technology. like, completely disconnected reality. even back ludicrous ""lifelong damage covid ain't bad"" claim numbers.

The public needs understand *far* people stop dying gods sake. adjuvant Oxford vaccine MF-59 mass manufactured UK. resident Alabama taken shit seriously beginning least speak little corner state, Houston County southeastern corner. 

While many people wearing masks go still many maskless either where-with-all concern getting right top you. stopped gas station earlier week girl behind counter seemingly decided stop wearing mask. fact wore one made point stop needed something. entered week followed sheriff’s deputy also maskless. 

When get groceries I’d say 40% hogs wearing masks. started spiking would say 5 - 10% maskless. 

Worry nuke south. nuking ourselves. Yup. Good enough. Pls. Release already Canada Medical personnel issue though. military deployed doctors nurses fight covid coming year civilian sector didn’t enough either.

But vaccinating 240,000 per day. vaccinating 1.5 million people per day. yes.... divide number vaccinating per day x10 (remember 10x population....) many US vaccinating per day get 0.16. Multiply 100 get percentage get 16%.
 
If still understand reading post responding multiple explanations it, can't help you. Thalidomide call raping pillaging, accurate description US dedicated manufacturing high need vaccines due prevalent virus (and fact missed chance get control quickly) then, vaccine get us back normal I’m specifically addressing sentiment “young healthy get this, old vulnerable get that,” especially paired “beggars can’t choosers” rhetoric. implies want vaccine, someone else make choice get less effective one grateful get vaccine period. doesn’t like that. 

Come on. It’s hard understand might frustrating someone actually right things would like effective vaccine available.  GOT CHILLS THEY'RE MULTIPLYING - anti-masker who's tested positive somewhere probably UK plants producing UK first never secret. announced early-mid last year around agreements place UK AZ/Oxford.

There appear bit ambiguity within EU - AZ contract, one point states initial dose EU plants. later point (and exclusive point mind) refrences UK plants. confusion appears stemmed this. 

Comparing AZ situation Pfizer apples v oranges, Pfizer 2 production bases, US US EU, rest world contracts with. EU exclusivity deal Pfizer EU plant would similar situaton.

Also Pfizer plant EU uses imports various places including UK make Pfizer vaccine. Fauci keeps clarifying goal keep people hospitals caskets. J&amp;J vaccine this. 
Nobody cares somebody gets stuffy nose. Yes! Can't stated enough. Thanks making abundantly clear onlooker. I'd love see someone could come ""vaccine"" animal bacterial infections. could drastically reduce use antibiotics animals, consequent development antibiotic resistant strains animal human diseases. Good. Better throwing away.  EU Commissioner already confirmed they’re blocking exports Canada. new controls AZ UK debacle. Pfizer ramping back almost 400k doses week end February here, although like Moderna ACTUALLY cut deliveries everyone 20-25% didn’t favour one customer another (except maybe US). annexure schedule thing. Schedules incorporated contract, Schedule specifically incorporated 1.24, 1.49, 5.4, 7.2 7.3.

Stop making things up. make sure health care professional administers vaccine. 

*Stares sternly college kids Philly botching vaccine distribution event* nice, desperate times mentality prevails ''every man himself''. That's humans/societies react.  least didn’t harmful things - bunch people die Covid destroy economy, keep kids schools, increase murder OD rates etc like UK US. we’re ranking strategies I’d put Korea NZ type first, Sweden, last UK/France/Italy/US Lol yeah. beats running. even eligible? 

Vaccination really important, celebrities skip front line. kind favor public. hope ya'll join us introverts join us often time. hard time finding anybody wanted party travel pre-pandemic alone  people access summer, maybe late spring lucky. can't imagine approving doubling different vaccines enough time passed effectiveness wear Moderna/Pfizer supply gets point enough anyone wants one. Neither happen next year soonest. low efficacy severe cases SA strain prevents hospitalizations entirely reporting former ignoring latter quadruple nothing? getting absurd. I’ve wearing mask year now, fucking way double wear it. gonna get vaccine expecting anything different? jumping joy saw J&amp;J data, especially protection severe cases hospitalizations. Screw way it’s phrased various news outlets- fantastic news!  huge. believe first single-shot refrigerable vaccine demonstrate efficacy phase 3 trial. fantastic news world, also super cheap make. could make feasible vaccinate nearly everyone world.

Only thing is, donating FREE remainder poor countries.

Where article say testing anyone? Let's see Biden hops Shout-out getting done. Amazing job. That's one mine, lot fun contact pre-COVID became one people ignore restrictions downplay virus everything started. eventually started getting attitude every time I'd reject offers hang mention numbers. Went regular near daily phone calls weeks recently, months last time text only. last text talked he's booked flight Miami soon. -_- Pretty sure stomach it. I'd take Sputnik V, similar AstraZeneca, I'm Hungarian too.

janitorial, food service, housekeeping people typically high risk exposure spread category. 

cannot work home. exposed public.

multigenerational households. Nice strawman. decide talking masks fixate attack me. When, bothered read opening comment thread someone isolating themselves. keep making things pursuing imagined slight. Assuming contract terms AZ tried that, good luck selling AZ medicines EU - cost vaccines medicines. EU market bigger UK. want cut supply EU sort way. would create severe problems rest business.

Besides member states suddenly paying orders, driving harder price bargains, refusing approve new medicines new uses, EU might go nuclear expropriate AZ patents profitable medicines. AZ needs keep EU happy possible circumstances. Deliberately cutting EU help UK would seriously hurt business. Right. beginning told mutations rare type virus compared viruses, would looking changes spike protein. Well, are. definitely part still concerned nefarious individuals. Maybe watched 12 Monkeys much kid, knows? I'm even necessarily pointing finger particular regime point, understand longer uncontrolled carelessness, opportunity giving virus change, equally possible someone randomly releasing strains different parts world-Controlling waves. odd emerge right time successful vaccines arriving. bunch random redditors understand lot stock market.  rollout increasing, weather get better like 6-8 weeks. 

I honestly understand worst ahead us. Maybe February, spring/summer we're closing this. 

But know? confused things get worse looks like things going get better.  I've heard they've telling sick people seem life-threatening stay home. floored need care weeks, meet bar hospital. Seems based progress clinical trials children assuming one two vaccines data approved within time frame. rate vaccination increased supply coming pipeline, vaccination general population available late spring-summer timeframe. believe ongoing clinical trials children still limited teenagers though. may 2022 later vaccine approved child’s age group hopefully achieved level herd immunity anyway. course it’s parent severe covid cases rare children. adults circle vaccinated personally wouldn’t wait start expanding bubble. It’s worth minuscule risk make sure child socialization. Also, Sinovac's trial Brazil included health care workers, much higher viral exposure general public

As far know, vaccine company trials health care workers 

It interesting Sinovac chose unfavorable trial condition, stringent criteria efficacy CNN NBC headlines morning 85% number titles. Nah way works.

That’s largely flu virus propagates, new vaccines produced every year

Viruses don’t go “take that! shiny new mutation evade vaccines!” simply new vaccine around corner counteract that. first goal curb community transmission, done vaccines far less effective 90%. that, worry better vaccines future mutations

Source: field choice biology studied virology, vaccinology epidemiology Hate, EU commission lying endangered people outside EU inside cover incompetence. simply admitted mistakes conversation would one thing desperate image avoiding reform, improve.

AZ breached published best effort contract, look 5.1 excludes UK initial production. 5.4 includes subsequent.

UK production probably close outstripping distribution weeks. conversation started threats blockade talks, could see support UK member states. UK government painted corner single dose leaving shores politically difficult. Rather providing equals likely going marketed aid failing EU. good us want closer EU ties.

The UK 1/3 total EU larger biotechnology pharmaceutical industry tighter rules things like environment. reason could spin factories quicker. No. commission sounds certain should

One side legal argument invariably biases case. That's judges. Mixing doses much interesting doubling up. think Russians good idea sputnik - two vectors, one shot.

It would also allow ""stretching"" mRNA vaccines. prime dose expensive hard manufacture mRNA vaccine, boost cheaper ChAdOx1 viral vector based vaccine. Projection? Teachers places US cant even teach evolution religious aholes. climate change skeptics rooted idea god let earth burn up. Religious idiots insist holding mass super spreader events. Fauch becomes octopus 8  Simply false. Children poor spreading virus, adults spread to. Sure. Let’s lie ensure compliance, right? Oh get wrong hope everyone gets vaccine soon possible. 

have good evening :) hope billings opens one soon one wheres masks correctly can't even get gas without worrying bringing covid home family. Yeah agree least recommended wear whenever we're around people. see damage dieeeee? /s think giving less vulnerable populations could consideration difficult issue. read report. numbers vaccines better numbers. Explain I'm wrong then. Explain teachers move ahead seniors essential workers public facing jobs. Many homeless, puts far higher risk. Majority? Lol hell no. thing makes hopeful J&amp;J AZ vaccines great potential widespread vaccination globally. certainly hope developed economies willing throw lot money getting vaccines developing world. take much swamp healthcare system countries. Reading suffering Manaus heartbreaking. 

95% effective mRNA vaccines great, hoping praying massive rollout economical 65% effective vaccines, help address lot suffering today, also rob virus mutation opportunities. think long run, someone Denver, Colorado, Glasgow, Scotland, etc... 65% jabs help us ""get back normal"" mRNA vaccines. sooner choke SARS-CoV-2 everywhere, better we'll be. See happens UK tries that. Block raw materials would severe response. Won’t happen. happen UK AZ production continue going UK. like UK government says. trials far 12-18, seen news beginning trials younger kids, anyone habe anymore info? impression 4 year old able get vaccinated 2021no matter It’s primarily variants seem even infectious. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

And hopefully US done export guys, kinda shitty already help closest neighbour. Anyway hope sort out. I'm honestly glad UK roll-out successful, mother grandmother live there, grandmother already received first dose vaccine (I'm sure one). 

It's looking like EU officials also need start taking blame this, need get act together guarantee much vaccine production possible. coincidence relatively minor issue blown proportion take heat EU national leaders slow sort broader vaccine issue out.

Well, dead dead, can't prevent someone dead die. Death can't severe case prevented someone already dead. Seems like wordings must mixed bit. don’t think that’s necessarily true. Well, existing facilities raw material supply chains re-oriented around vaccines provide excellent protection? reason right JnJ Novavax making candidates financial best interest, necessarily best interest society point proven winners vaccine modalities. sister teaches high school agrees me. I've high school kids there. Unless high school different others, I'm pretty sure handle it. good handle retail grocery store workers deal think risks higher. simply enough vaccine give everyone time it. I’m curious think answer here, I’m entirely sure. Genuine question, I’d love input understand study better. (I see point enormous number confounding factors, definitely accept social scientist.) Oh defintley likely vaccine many risk people west poor coutnires get big deal. affects timeline idk prob new normal start 2022 Ok? what, supposed conform others feel bad embarrassed?

That serious dystopia right there. Dr. Osterholm says worst pandemic still next 6-14 weeks new variants agonizingly slow vaccine rollout. I've found right far...any reason optimistic believe case? yeah.. problem (will quickly be) **supply**.

broken freezer matter they're empty. work well variants,

The vaccinate sera showed six-fold drop NAb titers towards SA variant. would surprised Moderna trial vaccines SA efficacy numbers would dropped to. Neither J&amp;J Novavax, Canada ordered those. get ""Kids get SARS II all!"" ""Kids get SARS II much lesser rate adults"", that's CDC's fault.

A lot Americans know comprehend scientific statements education underfunded subculture people's opinions touted level scientific statements. It’s interesting big complaint people. I’m even anti social don’t really mind masks public setting. biggest issue seeing friends person, going bars, seeing certain family members, concerts, movies. Interesting read lot it’s one aspect pandemic never bothered me. feel sympathy people. know lot people traveling fun, flying Florida Mexico vacation. NYC 24/7 vax centers.

I'm sure mostly supply constraint.. human resources..

Actually, I'll need source explanation case qualified. I'm biochemist, I'm sure understand explanation. would make sense likely infectious variant spread population vaccinated, pressure virus mutate. Basic principle evolution. saying would make likely, makes sense rn. Also, took US example wealthy country. would appreciate response point US different variants, hit heart saying. 

Also, go UK haha. Cheering spat EU LOL. tested children, delay ethics testing children, prioritizing adults fence getting vaccine I’m relatively young exercise lot. Seeing Fauci say along NYT article day solidified wanting get it. also started making plans move California it’s going be. 

When started considered absurd wait vaccine. Well, that. vaccine they’re telling still live way getting it? Fuck that. Like seriously, way I’m getting there’s trade quality life. There's argument made giving highly effective vaccine younger people likely socialize (e.g. college students) could strategically helpful short term controlling pandemic, we've vaccinated people actually risk severe symptoms / death.

It would probably fairly unpopular though, politically (""We giving good stuff drunk frat bros reward irresponsibility""). isn’t even vaccine approved anyone age 16, even ignoring tiered prioritization system. personally sick ""just stay home watch Netflix! grandparents GO WAR! bad, millions people worse"" rhetoric. gone home seen family friends year, hobbies activities participated pre-covid cancelled year, fucking clue end never ending goalpost shifts. Stop fucking minimizing pain - life feels completely boring, meaningless, empty right now. ""just"" staying home watching Netflix anymore. people went war 1940 negate that. Jesus. J&amp;J press release said, ""Efficacy severe disease increased time cases vaccinated participants reported day 49."" basically 100% efficacy 49 days.

The 66% figure mis-reported misunderstood.  jab awaits!!!!!!!!! like Canadian hat. US likely 4 vaccines approved end February, I'd like see restriction lifted soon. return normalcy depends Canada's return normalcy. 50% time works 100% time. Lack concensus happened? Science? think border shut science? Lmao uuhh Wishful thinking part. sure neither qualified. 

There nothing 5.1 indicates vaccine produced within EU. It’s “best effort” pledge. 5.4 UK plants explicitly listed manufacturing sites. Cant clear that. options get 66% effective one get any, I'll take 66% one. person positive test isn’t allowed board flight, doesn’t matter feel it, going book hotel drive home assessed post 28 days. 

But phase 2 trial found antibodies even higher day 57. get bulk protection first 28 days even likely next 28. read details J&amp;J report. 66% mild illness, severe illness 85% hospitalizations 100%. know 66% number everyone reporting think people far concerned severe illnesses. looked currently #44 :( handled early pandemic pretty well second surge vaccines....not much. here. longer trust many friends due absolute disregard NEED socialization. spouse, big yard, money time order online groceries, therefore can't everyone stay home make bread like they're doing? change lot since many experts expecting effective, also need dig specifics data know true impact have. good initial data looks, makes back normal end summer early fall plausible since increases number vaccines available give people since single dose J&amp;J agreed deliver 100 millions doses US end June. think people need remember efficacy data we're seeing today based immunity 28 days injection people getting doses June fully protected sometime July delay delivery medicine getting administered people. great news another piece puzzle need end pandemic, full impact wont known see independent review data. 100% better 95%?? event cancelled could organizer wanting take risk uncertainty summer/fall events. doesn’t mean won’t mostly back normal summer fall. 20-somethings 30-somethings take it, since odds getting hospitalized covid fairly remote demo. Plus one shot, disrupt lives &amp; wait line again. lot younger Millenials GenZ feel like they've given enough want get back living lives. They're longer fearful covid. even section 5.1

This wrong. 

If actually take second read point carefully, see says ""for purpose section 5.4 only..."". 

So UK included EU 5.4, section. Yes, even section 5.1.

Muppet 4 weeks would really great see numbers often ""long hauler"" syndrome occurs. reports anecdotes, people there, like Italian study cited 125 patients ""long haulers"" 2.5 million cases Italy.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* makes sense want effective vaccine. That’s anti vaxxer lol. Like I’m 26 year old. odds dying going hospital pretty minimal. vaccine prevents things really I’m looking for. I’m looking vaccine greatly reduces chance spreading virus high risk family members, coworkers, friends. 30 percent difference terms preventing infection big difference. Given fact according Pfizer/moderna’s numbers almost 400 million doses end may don’t think it’s unreasonable wait effective vaccine. Valid, think they'll final step normalcy. could see masks public places hit herd immunity probably nothing even remotely hurts businesses last long least 60 days safety data second dose, May earliest according FDA requirements.

Not true.

They removed portion CLS training decade ago. cant furnish proof, ideas Biden's plans based on....... ? signed Houston Fights Covid last summer. didn’t contact December kinda forgot time gets children, it’s already open season failed miserably vaccine distribution. people lose minds they’ve finally waiting gov says “oh here’s ANOTHER priority group front you” dose compared two though. considered decided general vaccine commentary news every day 12 months.

Covid occasionally cause pretty unpleasant long term complications young healthy people well. Well, bet could call doctor's office ask them.

Focus three things relevant focus regular people.

Simple solution, simple result... let professionals deal details we’re open.

Risk totally eliminated? No.

The risk tolerable, enough shots in... open fuck lose good-will. That’s works unfortunately. Pfizer arguing contracts signed doses, vials, start getting 6 doses vial instead 5, they’ll start sending less vials. Let's vax people going get us pandemic people perpetuating pandemic spreading misinfo Facebook. 

This right way. Typical. think wrong simply absolved saying they're sorry. That's crazy! helped try make appointments? San Francisco drive-through vaccination sites 65 crowd. Obligatory: flu joke either, bad. Get flu shots! US Executive Order place bans export vaccine vaccine related products, get facts straight.

As UK defacto ban place reserved doses entire order filled. There’s actually evidence Pfizer/Moderna would effective SA variant. That’s they’re working booster shots. word effectiveness P.1 found Brazil? even Pfizer Moderna least lab tests? Yes seems perfect somewhere like Africa get say "" **Brussels"",** agreed publish it. agreed redacted. Thank you. I’ve told many times sub past couple days Covid never going away advice live normally “get it” regards tangible negative health impacts said reality would imply. Like, wtf? Ahh! Lol got That’s good way put it. :) problem vaccine manufacturers aren’t sharing recipes due profit.

BioNTech licensed vaccine tech US Asia recently Sanofi ... hardly 90 year olds. I’m sure you’re bringing up.

Edit: 1.9 million Americans. Less 1% population.  estimates put 0.5-1 percent ifr. Don’t know you’re getting data from. studies using seroprevalence cfr. top it’s extremely infectious disease spreading rates much higher see respiratory diseases leading much higher rates hospitalization flu example even given restrictions, mask wearing, drastic reductions human interaction. argue restrictions severe stop downplaying real threat virus. Vaccine distribution contractual. companies contracts countries receive supplies plants. US can't reallocate third party countries tell pharmaceutical company, 'you know fuck Japan, send Canada'. US tried that, even tried reroute delivered, company would suspend deliveries US interfering negotiated contracts hold countries. know, Dr. Osterholm considered pessimistic side things. That's say he's *wrong*, necessarily, take opinion grain salt. explained kids take precautions take need protect people like grandma grandpa rest family, families too. told (the kids) get virus worse cold them. protect grandmas grandpas people could seriously hurt, OK stuff again. seem get it. Cool. long it’s applied everybody don’t think problem it.  Except...life tends messier that. hate injecting race based example it’s real life. get conversations showing vaccine status test results often seems tone we’re talking inconveniencing Capitol insurrectionists something. don’t acknowledge whole element it. Tell vaccines still effective variants. percentages effectiveness reported media preventing symptomatic infection. vaccines substantially effective preventing severe disease. vaccinated person, risk severe illness (requiring hospitalization) essentially zero. 

Alternatively, tell goalpost ending beyond vaccines. vaccine enough move back toward normal life, staying home forever.  Reddit infested self-hating Americans smug Europeans. hand, I’m pretty happy news! phase 3 data,its fake States authorize people normally vaccinations - trainee dr &amp; nurses, dentists, eye dr, veterinarians even training fire fighters plus asking medical workers who've retired volunteer. saw interview ER Dr vaccinated people without pay day off.

with hospitals full near full plus staff sick quartered already shortages delayed getting people vaccinated start everyone could work already taking care patients. that's addressed Russians simply producing engineered strain human adenovirus. 

Any reason decided use exact vaccine second dose? possible develop antibodies viral vector used first dose, could hinder efficacy. Israel exempt also guarantees two dose trial look effective since second dose given 57 days. Totally agree! saying open right now. saying get position everyone get vaccine choose think opening stuff. need go 0 100. Like able sit restaurant 100% capacity months would nice effectiveness mean terms vaccine? There’s going much bullshit know   tracking R number virus given state, get info? source I've using stopped functioning directs massive dashboard another website seem R number, need new one check multiple times day. talking something else, case AZ starts another contract comission. case, breach agreement happen trying honour newer deal. Plus easier make transport these, give demographics likely carriers spreaders rather ones disease seriously threatens. bet it'd sure number R0 virus. understand, it’s natural inclination protect children matter sometimes strike balance fear facts. might help research rare children experience severe symptoms covid.

""There clear effect vaccine COVID-19 cases requiring medical intervention (hospitalization, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), reported cases among participants received Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, 28 days post-vaccination.""

This study 40,000 participants. promising. still balk saying anything ""100% effective"", disappointment people tens millions inevitably get sick die, numbers would finally bearable. hope J&amp;J get production pipeline gear. realise could say exact UK? stopped reading ""United States secured 800 million doses"" 3.5 UK receives EU produced vaccins Thank you, that's best explanation response I've received. makes sense. clarify, ""stuffy nose"". J&amp;J vaccine prevent ppl admitted hospital, may still need O2 monitoring home. point pandemic unclear whether ppl normally admitted hospital observation sent home hospital beds scarce. supply issues UK factories, started production EU ones hopefully fixed now, making profit vaccine pandemic eagerness sell greed.

I've called trade war, EU wanting take doses UK's supply, meanwhile stoping exports UK sounds like start one Ok somewhat relief 1 4 parents/in-laws least, get J&amp;J vaccine. bad old age often accompanied illness. matter EU, rightly wrongly. It’s extremely tricky many simultaneous policies implemented trying aggregate across countries going run problems details policies themselves, implementation, adherence differ countries (not mention social economic context they’re implemented!)

I honestly think probably way reasonably tease apart effects NPIs strictly comparing countries estimated aggregate instantaneous Rs. would much convinced adequate tracing data look transmission targets interventions well behavioral response policies much deeper analysis estimated transmissions prevented policies *within* country. course requires actually reliable tracing data detailed behavior analysis, don’t have.

It may well stay-at-home orders little immediate effect gathering limits early people actually self-isolating, suspect additional effect depends implementation people react them.

This paper falls “maybe better nothing” category data much better, think doesn’t proper foundations specific analyses it’s trying do. It’s good evidence NPIs work aggregate, that’s it. evidence back claim? I've hearing 3 months 

"" results week"" may 2019 Seveneves. Novavax data absolutely conclusive evidence SA variant vaccine resistance. also conclusive evidence Brazil variant evade natural immunity. explain Midwest states like North Dakota, 145 cases yesterday never mask mandate place compared CA, mask mandates cases control? I’m talking vaccine science itself, production, distribution, etc. Creating mRNA vaccines variants straightforward point, thought clear? mother professor, 60s. supposed get 1st dose pfizer vaccine Monday Feb 1st week said shot postponed Feb 11th.

So Moderna said article. nose virus first place... better leaving mouth out🙄 hard wear mask properly...  Yeah honestly kind hard understand explain. Like one explanation Pfizer like lot things, someone throws number like 52% everyone grabs onto without understanding means. basically average say 25 days vaccine effective 12 them. could say 52% effective entire period could say 90% effective 12 days statements would true. someone works kids, low income kids that, confirm kids aren’t alright many affected years come. Socially, academically, mentally, etc. One kids work took life yesterday. 9. Post-COVID Bucket List:

- Eat restaurant.
- Shake someone's hand.
- Drink beer someone met.
- Listen live orchestra.  Eh, that's little simplistic approach. data, approaches, conclusions equally valid. great respect pandemic experts listen to. I've also read early reports studies inherently flawed. accept every scientist scientist. make large proportion, frankly doesnt matter everyone 18+ already vaccinated anyway

Children tend socialize children. plausible vaccinating everyone 18 achieve herd immunity virus still able spread amongst children. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

I'm asking people think vaccinated people need hide houses 85% people immunity. 

So, general sane idea two weeks second Pfizer Moderna dose maximum protection, around 90% not. That's people feel relax least internally possibly see people vaccinated hang like normal. 

What people get J&amp;J? They'll never reach %. also two weeks after? can't Moderna Pfizer two weeks first dose?

I’m also fairly certain H1N1 exact time, sick home week flu-like illness. Honestly J&amp;J news morning, think could make solid case approve AZ's vaccine US. 

By April/May vaccine supply really much issue anymore. definitely seems like big win countries struggling health care infrastructure, Ethiopia United States. Evidence suggests children less likely adults contract spread it, still can. means children could potentially act transmission vector reservoir virus. Best vaccinate children can. Could actually AZ currently sending vaccine EU UK? Would *that* bold? even single package found, UK would done trade talks. Sure want cynical it, don’t see way. One vaccination could possibly impact thousands others situation. wait Sanofi vaccine, available anyday now... Yep countries jealous progress US people US think vaccine rollout complete failure. someone science background taken courses immunology, want assure vaccine give COVID-19. cannot. two vaccines available United States SARS-COV2 virus except part code spike protein.

One vaccine virus code little spikey bits, without code rest (the shell, enzyme replicates RNA).  code gets run cells makes spikes, immune system identify make antibodies.

The virus inactive adenovirus (cold-causing virus) little spikey bits added code. spikey bits particular virus infiltrates cells.

That's good. need one dose vaccine ASAP. 66% hell lot better 0%. That's impressive, little late. hope already produce stockpile whatever can, approved *somewhere* weeks. Yeah think we'll know sure longterm symptoms covid longitudinal studies conducted, polls. think safe say obvious longterm complications scarring lungs damage heart, obviously that's majority. Sputnik also adenovirus vaccine. J&amp;J vaccine actually far that. say prevents 85% serious illnesses 100% hospitalizations 28 days. gets lost ""66% efficacy"" headlines results really good especially considering single dose easy transport/store. Talking contracts... seen AZ/UK one yet? using military fight CoVID19 since day 1.

Vaccine development: military

Testing support: military

Hospital staffing supplement: military

Hospital building retrofit: military

Vaccine distribution: military

Vaccine purchase: military

The military involved since day one. make mistakes! included. ""you're analyzing things much! care raw numbers context whatsoever!""

Yes it’s called relying data contextual anecdotal evidence. Odd concept new you, subreddit bring lot scientifically illiterate people Let make clear. One country learned early mistakes improved. One continued get worse. latter opportunity every single day save lives future, nothing.

Uhhh realize France higher death per capita rate recently early December right? Like said making mind based perceive things, ignoring data actually shows trial. enough data say much otherwise. think so. Afaik, get enough data group. read headlines today ineffective, know *that* data come from. indeed ineffective, UK would soon know. wait Sputnik V. 27,884,661 total doses including 22,858,318 first doses 4,780,888 second doses 01/29/2021.

26,193,682 total doses including 21,698,606 first doses 4,263,056 second doses 01/28/2021.

1,690,979 doses administered (vs 1,561,585 01/22, 8%) including 1,159,712 first doses (vs 1,189,836 01/22, 2.5%) 517,832 second doses (vs 362,022 01/22, 43%).

Per CDC dose number determined nearly reported doses administered but, missing data dose number, sum people receiving 1 doses people receiving 2 doses exactly equal total doses administered.

For data, see: EU taken stance start, countries could looked source vaccines elsewhere invested internally manufacturing.

We need get everyone vaccinated soon possible AZ vaccine could really help us get there. think several factor happening - lower mobility described, fact places seemed burn vulnerable populations getting infected (essential workers households/people taking precautions), plus Dec/Jan usually worst month flu season things start lightening Feb, may similar seasonality COVID. really started seeing significant effects vaccinations yet, suspect start help lower numbers point Feb. RN thing I'm worried could cause numbers rise new contagious variants, we'll see plays - could really go either way, I'm praying everything keeps declining population get vaccinated quickly.  think Pfizer Moderna manufactured fast possible already J&amp;J hopefully coming soon.

We need vaccinate every person area huge impact. Kids eligible probably 60% eligible adults take it. important vaccinate elderly health conditions 15% population. done hospitalizations fatalities decline 80-90% think relax little. EU 76% vaccine production capacities world. already exporting many countries like UK, Canada, Israel, Mexiko, ... BioNTech/Pfizer vaccines produced EU except ones US. question regards teaching school:

If test kids every day school would already around line get tested delay test results?

I get messaging logistics make sense. Im personally not. want protect. rate Ill get covid shot. Yeah, Latino actually race, cultural group.  realize we’re living Wuhan circa March 2020! Restaurants even bars still open depending live. Plus lot outdoor activities like hiking going beach actually safe. agree principle, already like 4 variants caution. One them, ""UK variant"" already present like 24-25 states shown possibly 50% transmissible original virus. variant South Africa also showing early signs may able evade protection, though yet see conclusive evidence this.

The issue virus still raging basically everywhere variants keep popping time. likely evolve kill everyone? No, mutates state prior infection vaccine stop it? alone huge problem, even knowing vaccine makers claim could create vaccine variants within 6-8 weeks. there's whole distribution vaccine convincing people going take 50 vaccines year. Plus 8 week time frame really going bring uneasiness people take it.

This even really ""what if"" scenario anymore either, UK variant causing clear spikes Europe South African variant already shown ability evade protection, even 5% reduction effectiveness, precedent variant truly resistant. effectively locked away rest world knows when? anyone managed stop reading covid? guess no. information grim now:

+ high prevalence long term effects -- especially mental health problems

+ New variants infectious herd immunity kick 80% vaccinated

+ watching vaccine line drag feet

+ Forcing everyone back work b117

Like people, used adjust fear based death rate life generally ok. believed get better. Turns quite right horrifying. Really keeping glued screens. hate it.

I'm sure many also come across nightmare fact virus changed mind it. manage forget? 

Starting feel real jealous covidiots countries Europe are. People obsessed Sweden. Austria similar level population-weighted density, similar amount deaths, happens next Norway Finland, they're bad Sweden apparently.

Actually live Austria Sweden fully comparable. Austrians less distancing culture usually country side also quite densely populated compared sweden (half country mountainous area one lives top mountain) people gather strongly there.

The areas hit hardest second wave Austria mostly rural areas medium sized cities bigger ones better people already taking care. problem Autumn government wennt full Sweden November hit emergency brakes partially.

We fine Norway style numbers spring really fucked autumn going Sweden full force! Anybody know there’s research whether get Johnson Johnson follow either Moderna Pfizer months later? understand need get vaccinated ASAP, damn 90-95%, 100% serious covid feel lot better 66-72%, 85% severe covid. useless. That’s downvoted. vaccines still prevent DEATH, severe cases peopling crashing hospital useless. EU signed contract august, payed advance august, company said 'we deliver', week approval 'oops, cant deliver'. 
We agree AZ blame, right? told AZ knew would chance ramp Biontech even more.
EU choose block export accept prioritized, hard choice no. Yeah Fauccccci. OK. Thanks. virus never going fully eradicated unless figure eradicate corona-type viruses decades technologically possible. finna get fake ID get vaccinated Children tend severe reaction illness. Long term effects even asymptomatic children unknown, know affects heart, pulmonary, lung health ways medical professionals describe ""permanent"". 

This could generation's polio, time iron lungs come 30's instead right away. sure get numbers 52 63 Yep, really sad. Athletes, celebrities, whoever takes help influence opinion, I'm it. smart Seattle shows desperately people want vaccine. guess people take covid seriously all. one know, people do. public health officials: nooo gotta social distance months xd lot “anti-vaxxers” changing mind, find relatives safe it, they’ll get themselves. understand might want get higher efficacy rates. sooner everyone gets vaccinated, however, sooner ends everyone. interesting explanation could sun. Europe generally virus rather weak summer (also Africa) clusters generally control. Problems started people gathered back indoors sun became weaker.

Florida vice versa, people lock summer rest year often outdoors enjoying sun, might also affect.

However giving rising numbers Africa african variation like virus currenty going Manaus Brazil seem problem anymore, maybe english variant well. depends were, too. many confirmed cases swine flu Ontario (~8600) entire year's outbreak we've new confirmed COVID cases since Monday, scales infection equally shared around world. Yes, right. good move AZ. AZ business EU EU. business important long term UK business. So. good solution AZ. May three side agreement distribute productions fair ask help boost production. NYT do?

In total 76% vaccines made EU. Well UK already banned flights wrong London Dubai world's busiest air route normal times simple terms:

\- put 100 unvaccinated people room insert covid

\- put 100 vaccinated people another room insert covid

\- unvaccinated group ends with, say, 27 people moderate severe covid.

About 66% less.

AZ/Oxford embroiled supply controversy right production issues. really going figured time make difference US? wait another freezer failure 2nd shot? perfect country right now. People ""end up"" 15% health conditions... either health conditions don't. serious conditions like diabetes, heart disease, etc.

Everyone gets sick days every then. People seem lost track fact lived surrounded viruses decades. Covid new particularly serious elderly people poor health vaccines treatments really whole lot different virus. source zero profit?  know agreed sell production cost 'developing nations'.  

But even determining cost price? They've agreed prices front contracts, agreed subsequent contracts would affect things like equipment amortization, raw material purchase costs staff efficiency.  Unless going subsequently refund everyone overcharged, almost certainly making profit way. long one dose?  Right?

I mean, want get sick, end world either. Mainly want stay hospital. Yep - hit nail head.

There lot people mixing up, it’s misinformation. Fear = money I’m sorry hear that!

Asthma may high risk factor, depending state live in, may eligible vaccinated. haven’t registered made appointment, might best soon can. Main difference european countries way higher population density.

But Sweden really much better?

11.000 deaths roughly 9 mio people 30% even living higher density areas, rest spread onto area big germany france combined, underdeveloped village system (for historical reasons remote farms preferred make country easily defendable)

So uk around 65 Mio 100.000 deaths, Sweden fares better uk, given deaths metropolitan areas basically attribute deaths roughly 3 mio people. would call Sweden success story, neither countries (including mine) co-worker coming back office least 10 days! rapid tests notorious giving false negatives asymptomatic. &amp; gf need take extra caution public, especially around middle-aged &amp; older folk. btw, takes 5 6 days enough virus replicate even register PCR swab, even gf tested today tomorrow still soon. tell office manager best in-person meetings clients next 10 days, unless infecting bonus freebie. So, problem? buy vaccines Russia China DoH, WHO, elite cabal Jews? Why? enjoy things? old article. know Russian vaccine highly efficacious Actually, even one dose regiment russian vaccine much efficacious AstraZeneca's, [between 73 85 might suggest chimpanzee adenovirus really less efficient infecting human cells, find hard believe Oxford would make mistake like that. Imma try learn it.

As two dose thing, Russians use Ad26 Ad5 vectors two doses. paper talks different human adenovirus strains using Ad26 strain helps avoid immunity. Ad5 one likely neutralized, seem made work. case, Russians obviously taken issue consideration, seeing used 2 different strains. Yeah gotten second dose Moderna say vaccine LOADED ... Lymph node swelling, joint soreness, fatigue ... rapid heart rate ... imagine could cut bit younger people, instance, keep appears extreme dose old immunocompromised. maybe second dose could half dose mean seriously kick immune system's ass hard month later remember lesson? I'm guessing know point regardless worth sweat covid-19 couple weeks (although I'll still take precautions keep people safe comfortable, like wearing mask, I'm asshole) large decrease mobility South Dakota North Dakota coupled states large increases mask usage (chart right charts).

The reason would be, helpful mutations normally different original- anything different likely destroy original function coronovirus crown protein, case virus particle can't infect anybody.

The new variants likely slight difference makes somewhat effective infecting humans. coronavirus protein still large pretty similar shape configuration, thus still recognized body's immune system one original vaccines.

Moving forward, vaccine companies would probably develop boosters new variants maximize effectiveness, maybe develop 'cocktails' would effective 2-3 prevalents strains time. revise every year necessary. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

what mean always clear strategy FHM Tegnell stuck meant exported. fully relies reasonable context Sweden, laws, cultural traditions, full extent bureaucracy around healthcare, education think important continue use means know work, countries traditions may necessary use laws, countries end different types crises. think important think suits us.

[Tegnell March genuinely sorry hear politician country decided become fan boy version Swedens strategy sell population without due cause. I'm sorry sounded rude first reply you. Glad hear doctor called publicly!

About schools I'm still convinced closing school younger children *a huge driver second infection wave*. data seem support kids school drivers epidemic. [This study](http://modmedmicro.nsms.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/infectivity_manuscript_20210119_merged.pdf) probably strongest evidence far. studied 145k people 330k close contact pcr contact events occurred within households (67.7%), followed visits households (12.0%), attending events activities (11.2%), 220 workplaces education proportion PCR-positive tests lowest contacts children, particular contact events work/education.

This might case every country though, depending school system works general, sizes classes. Sports physical education seems biggest risk according CDC study came recently too. nEw NoRmAL!!! 5G stuff nonsense, got Pfizer vaccine week half ago life exactly same; fact, even better I've purchased twelve Microsoft^^(TM) Surface^^TM laptops assorted accessories along full slate Microsoft^^TM annual subscription services!

/s Yup could see mRNA dominant platform future vaccines this. Even better figure encode ""generic"" antigen could induce equal immune response variants. I've wondering... someone gets vaccine unexpectedly, example pharmacy doses need used end day - person get second dose? 5 since Februar. though? many people die auto accidents school every year? supporting person school despite deaths also make disgusting? perhaps, perhaps, population 330 million, desire shut activity children might modicum danger pure nonsense. 

The numbers matter. Shutting schools maybe 200 kids 5 18 might saved covid year fucking nuts. number 20,000, we’d different conversation it. 

The “even one death many” crowd preposterous. Yea don’t understand people haven’t vaccinated getting planes. THEY’RE ones calling here. want bolster people’s confidence science convince get jab, absolutely *not* it. sound naive. Dublin angry. sure come it, misstep EU. It’s good enough young population/low risk individuals. 

They release numbers age groups. it’s least 75-80% effective 40 something, would help lot reaching heard immunity. might change much, that’s least one apology American Protestant group made. know seen much behavior changing. Things re-opening lot people still ignoring restrictions place.

Ok. explain large decrease mobility time high mask usage  personally seen mean data show it. kids 18-64? try buy vaccine US UK. everything world due racism. Florida could care less virus.

26th nation deaths per million.

I understand they've kept heads. country perfectly good everything. Anything took mass public compliance never ever going thing culturally diverse globally connected place like US. yeah mitigation wasn’t ever going go well we’re damn good medical breakthroughs emerging pharmaceutical development. yeah one gonna get everything right. United States’ time shine! would call roughly 420.000 deaths upcalc population lot better USA. Sweden one big metropolitan area 2 smaller ones country basically isolated Spring/Summer! USA fucking rocks get shots arms thus protect hospitals... that, we’ll open move on. It’ll happen quickly. stick idea putting resources issue solve faster.  genius move.

pure genius logic there. UK blocked exports. did? Canada Israel would affected block. fault?

Weirdly, Canada yes Israel not. I'm unclear why. work set us free? Oh yeah I'm 25% capacity 100% since basically beginning. always wear mask indoors places necessary like stores needed. 

I think extremely positive news. one shot, storage way better another vaccine add arsenal fight covid. get people vaccinated quicker time point. hopeful! that’s exactly point is. getting convince fans should. call ethos.

Bc yes fact America. 

That organization dedicated helping impoverished third world countries. America. 

I don’t believe second bc US, hot mess. nothing disappointing this. bigger global impact MRNA vaccines Good :) - grim “Ekka Zohar said encouraged light symptoms vaccinated people caught coronavirus, well low infection rates. “None hospitalized light symptoms,” stated. “We talking headache mild feeling sickness, almost completely without fever.

Yeah 87% age 45-65, majority people already serious health conditions. People 45 little risk, 25 little risk almost non event them. offer older people likely hospitalised? issue transparency data. AZ's initial ""report"" incredibly misleading, using phrases like ""99% effective preventing illness"", actually 62% effective preventing INFECTION. Things like made US scientific community take pause make try again, rightfully so. Unless term agreements AstraZeneca must supply UK first

It's believed UK contract stipulates doses manufactured UK cannot exported UK received 100 million doses. signed EU's, manufacturing facilities UK paid using UK treasury money.

Would nice see UK contract, understand neither UK gov AZ interested publishing it.

Either way, even EU's interpretation contract correct, EU can't really legally demand remedy breach contract demanding AZ break prior contract. since UK manufacturing facilities UK soil UK would difficulty enforcing position (possession 9/10ths law) anyway.

Johnson Johnson single person got vaccinated, illness four weeks, ended hospital,"" Dr. Mathai Mammen, global head pharmaceutical research development Johnson &amp; Johnson, told NBC News. ""leads believe vaccine stop pandemic.""

[NBC effective preventing hospitalization. Make vaccine available everyone ages 18-55 end pandemic now. single shot, unlike others require boosters, part trial test different variants. couple related clauses considering make complex. reddit

You get choice mate That's lie super exhausting. vast, vast majority Australian's attempted return done so. honestly know people keep repeating garbage. watched video, makes reference 5.4 vs. 5.1 whether contradiction even difference scope.

To me, two points:

1. 5.1 also cover plants UK (in isolation, obviously not, could fall within obligation 5.4); 
2. AZ's obligations UK prevent fulfilling warranty 13? also running 2 dose study. data soon. [Ensamble 2  guarantee it’s rare mild case long term effects chances hospitalized.... Flu depending year get even lower 50% conducting double dose trials may make effective Excellent summary - thanks! explanation 'best effort' relates best effort creating vaccine, best effort producing it. So, EU's argument vaccine developed, best effort longer applied 100% effective hospitalizations deaths. thing matters. (Severe disease mean hospitalization) 

Most people willing endure risk symptomatic infections near zero risk needing hospitalized dying.

**""Not single person got vaccinated, illness four weeks, ended hospital,**"" Dr. Mathai Mammen, global head pharmaceutical research development Johnson &amp; Johnson, told NBC News. ""leads believe vaccine stop pandemic."" hahahahaha, people believes media corrupted medical staffs funny. see politicians changing minds every week. Remember, government would told eat shit, stop spreading virus, make sure really eat it! anti vaxxer vaxxer, care, shit others without knowing reasoning health, even forcing opinion putting guilt blame listening you, also charged human genocide alongside corrupted politicians, one sided media news, well silencing anyone high education, real respected medical/disease scientists, dares speak facts government. bet people listen politicians tell feel instead you, actually thinking yourself, yourself. Americans deserve get vaccinated every week, test medicine :))) Ban truth call people proofs political measurements conspiracy theorists, right! :D  advocated masks one point early on. believe stupid psychological reason. 

He might good infectious disease expert, he’s pathetically bad messaging public policy. one concerns. Even mild covid leave long term deficiencies. I'd curious see prevent long covid response. stupid thing say know hard transport, store distribute vaccines need frozen specific temps? us live urban centers get one vaccines easily, everyone else shot get might options otherwise.  I’m referring requirements states within occupied territories. realize touchy subject I’m sure two populations area reasonably governed two separate ‘federal’ (PA guess) governments. People can’t agree “essential” workers though. state bickering classifications different ones would bit difficult consider alternative though. Would want 66% vaccine now, 95% vaccine half year? JJ provide volume (and need half volume) much bigger game changer other, effective vaccines. also stops contagious, 66% people massive impact R-numbers, (if numbers big enough) way safer everyone waiting 95%.

Edit: even one getting it, drops change infection 66% (with change enormous begin with), change complications mild infection fraction again, change long-term effects would pretty tiny. Relative Moderna Pfizer unequivocally yes lol.  ""I think one concerning things know two people know one another travel South Africa presumption is, point, community spread strain,"" Dr. Rochelle Walensky told Savannah Guthrie NBC's ""TODAY"" show.

Or maybe origins SA ? 85% severe cases, 100% hospitalizations four weeks. They're different EU's bad position here, given legs Pfizer chairs made UK (the lipid nanoparticles) ""Slow"" mean ""eliminate."" Moderna Pfizer really got lucky trails concluded new mutations took over. really fair compare numbers new vaccine? Someone tell feel this.


On one hand know 66% comparable (or perhaps even better?) yearly flu vaccine, plus obviously single shot one there. hand seems different nearly others reporting 80-90%+ effectiveness. still works better variants say vaccinated, yeah SA variation troubling.

But could avoided countries learned fucking lesson shut damn borders clearly one actually cares Yup, that? dispute really whether fulfilling EU order UK plants. contract makes clear obligation so. Exactly. Nursing homes state testing employees biweekly. Fortunately #3 overall country per capita testing fairly easy get. yeah testing people symptoms people exposure positivity rate would lot higher. wonder vaccines like one would reduce long hauler issues people having. Like still get symptoms impactful later on? Johnson Johnson single person got vaccinated, illness four weeks, ended hospital,"" Dr. Mathai Mammen, global head pharmaceutical research development Johnson &amp; Johnson, told NBC News. ""leads believe vaccine stop pandemic.""

[NBC 85 percent didn’t require hospitalization didn’t severe case disease already pretty rare young people hospitalized think that’s far less effective? Nah AZ/Oxford badly botched data. haven’t approved. shares AZ benefiting event, AZ making profit. EU ungracious organisation effectively providing vaccines charity basis. get summary point AZ messed up, UK EU negotiate.  It’s nature mrna vaccines order get response need specific amount mRNA comes side effects. mrna side effects. combo need double amount, significantly increasing side effects. Serious question: people going argue vaccine game-changer keeps people hospital?

And so, *direct contradiction* argument even young healthy people need ultra-cautious getting disease even mild cases cause permanent damage?

(To clear, firmly camp 2, want wait get 95% effective vaccine, would great someone could convince wrong!) worries, Keystone XL ""Buy American Order"" I'm talking Isnt 50% target vaccines like flu vaccine, there’s many strains try guess ones prominent year?

There one strain started, imho 85% quite decent, there’s excuse high Pfizer &amp; Moderna, imho.  TIL people, even black, care Tyler Perry still Please it. 20 Single dose around 70% excellent. JNJ already two dose trial underway required fact vaccine single dose preferable logistics profile (easy store transport) much effective global scale.

Many industrialized nations see near total coverage PZE Moderna vaccines superior getting 4 billion people earth crushing. 

I would foresee two dose even mixed vaccines boosters 2020 2021.

We face facts though. little evidence thus far 2021 maskfree year. vaccines prove crushing effect many geographies overall risk still many vulnerable groups awaiting real guidance. get this. says 85% severe COVID prevented 100% hospitalisations. term 'severe' mean include hospitalisation? would use term 'severely ill' describe someone close death I'm guessing means something else  Dude I’ll take Faded Glory version this. Gimme dat 💉💉💉 Yup, use one like college kids 40 good health. Probably I’d want 70 year old aunt iffy health use, acceptable 21 year old grandson get vaccine I'm going see family. think given one jab vaccine, efficacy always expected lower. Although 100%, 85% efficacy preventing severe cases still pretty good vaccine contribute towards massive reduction hospitalisations deaths. Especially focussed towards general population, rather vulnerable. say wrong compare countries? think makes sense compare Nordic neighbours bit more, people acting like compare countries other, European countries well, think absurd, considering substantial population density differences such. People obsess Sweden much, that's all. recommended two doses. “15 days slow spread” I’m sure who’s ass you’re pulling info maybe you’re doom posting trolling saying think need 2 year lockdown J&amp;J data take vaccine reserved say 50 years old? seems make sense. Lol it’s probably states already. vaccines effective it. It’s barely contagious. There’s zero reason take different action we’re already taking strains. Indeed, basically UK supply permitted EU (section 5.4) obligation AZ send UK supplies EU (5.1). It’s perfect, doesn’t be. cuts transmission half keeps people dying ending hospital, it’s it’s job. take day long. Yeah lawyer messed up. think EU wanted 5.4 include UK part EU clause 5, 5.4. that's what's written. get 50% traditional. 2 vastly superior, really wants one? People going upset “luck” J&amp;J one. Agreed, it'll take quite develop booster SA variant, wait another vaccine comes online, Novavax Astra take finish trials U.S Brilliant? exactly yesterday lol. 2 effective vaccines. What's fun require call cancel sub. deleted virtual credit card, fuck that. would imagine could make case reasonable expect company break prior contact order meet yours. Sounds like something decided court.

And yet, EU bought vaccines. sites. AZ make best efforts produce enough vaccines - UK, EU Mars. 

I think EU rail AZ court bring EU red-tape might frankly idea you’re talking about. “Lmao”. two dose trial completed? Thanks! Just, looked up. right, thanks pointing out. one long Johnson compared Pfizer&amp;Pfizer Moderna&amp;Moderna.  Well make feel better. get really sick flu every years despite getting shot. worry someone higher chance contagious vaccine embolden take risks. Ah, sorry, right. 90% point efficacy. Confidence interval 67-97. 


As LD/SD split - mean say saw results, commited honouring result LD/SD SD/SD together? LD/SD somehow closer 0% efficacy, would fail whole vaccine altogether numbers would drop 50%? 


As unavailable trial results - issue AZ (and I'm pro-vax, optimistic vaccines). producer time approval publish full data. natural optimist, seriously look good - provided credible explanation this, reason figure full data paints worse picture preliminary. Right? Crazy! outside observer dog fight, EU looks dumb entire thing. likely reduces probability long COVID too, lot. important thing 66% enough herd immunity. worried still get Moderna Pfizer next year, bet necessary then. comes risk though, means breathe significantly carbon dioxide much lowers cognitive abilities, pretty negligent let double masked people drive cars busses caps perform sort dangerous work construction work. Air quality extremely important cognitive function actually pass it. Carbon dioxide poisoning real thing people always go outside take mask break never wear mask long. Thanks! love cold weather agree. I’ve seen many state plates think area we’re populated. Traffic nightmare. live central Florida lake county! stay warm too! yea elephants, mean comparable. get superbugs due vaccines. Germany blocked export PPE, yet want take vaccines countries live really global world. 50-60% US population vaccinated even less globally, normal summer. 
We need root world get control, US Yeah time tell true efficacy J&amp;J vaccine. good feeling this! vaccine useless SA variant lmao. 52-57% effective. barely passes threshold even approved. Portugal suspended flights UK Saturday order limit influx new variant, first identified Kent. repatriation flights countries came week UK halted flights Portugal effort stop variant detected Brazil reaching UK – decision labelled “absurd” Portuguese government.

Looks like Portugal's desperation British tourist money really screwed over. Yeah sounds insane. zombie apocalypse, sound paranoid. Alright. I’m sorry pessimistic comment. long cuts hospitalization deaths, we’ll fine. Getting kids wear one pain, doubt can’t get two. Velocity matters lot here. faster people gets shots faster reduce deaths get back normal. Plus Pfizer Moderna missed bunch production targets. Vaccines lower impact Covid common flu (what vaccines more) would literally reason go back normalcy. ""We see EU thing"" Pre payment production capacity? EU payed something like EUR250 mill back august purpose.

AZ sold goods (or timeline) twice cant deliver. Unfortunately means EU likely follow UK's lead limit vaccine export. mean stage 3 trials come back countries it. Exactly. understand gripe it’s around 50% effective compared 90%+ rate first two vaccines, flu shot generally 40-60% effective given year. It’s enough significantly reduce transmission, need right now. logistics vaccine requires 1 dose needs refrigerated immense get shots arms much quickly.

Edit: grammar tough clause states AZ informed EU delays first instance delays?  Maybe I'm selfish see silver lining comments. people attitude, faster move pecking order get J&amp;J vaccine.  weeks vaccine shot, get Covid antigen test verify immunity. Embarrassing? irresponsible self-serving boy kind Republican Party United States. Despicable. Honestly it'd impressive could fit microchip tiny tiny needle. Like damn.

On serious note, I'm sorry mil feel fortunate grandparents intend get vaccine available. anyone see videos celebrations championship game?

Hardly surprise weeks later they’d top. 

On hand, you’d think sleeping cousin sister would keep pods tighter reduce transmission outside groups. Guess wasn’t enough.

Roll Tide. Yes, that's want. younger folks handle illness, brainer. also get vaccine 10000 followers Insta. Reddit, ladies gentlemen J&amp;J track produce 98 million single-shot vaccinations US summer, 1 Billion worldwide end year. Prevented hospitalizations 100%. I'm this. evolve. like every living thing. Can't compare. Humans dealt flu millennia. already previous immunity. 

This different. Like said, go film people using public transport. video get any! Get it?

Do want believe eyes use metro every morning? lot's people using face coverings, way 4-6 weeks ago. everyone, sometimes feels like majority real measures would face masks supermarket, buses, restaurants?

Ok, **are** support universal mask mandates? That's I'm confused, seems like think used like form oppression post subreddits. 

Also, harsh restrictions enforced fines **not** mean ""your country nothing prevent covid"". Turns people follow recommendations pretty well make choices prevent covid. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yes, one.  Yup, partner UK immunocompromized got AZ vaccine earlier week. choice one want.

It's ideal, stops going hospital dying that's lot better we've deal last year. I'd much rather protection wait half year Pfizer Moderna supplies available. literally thing care about. could get COVID really become ""just flu bro"" even less severe, we've won. many people dying COVID diseases, hospitals full. give relief.

I received Sinopharm jab, even though know may protect getting COVID. know, sure, severe case. there’s one thing agree disagree! LOL good day thinking bacteria antibiotic resistance. EU fault? Incredible. They've really brainwashed people like despite delaying months.

Pull calendar work long UK, US, Japan, Israel Canada EU signed. idea 65+. guess say true. I’ll read break! Appreciate taking time write out. I'm sure easier, conventional vaccine may mean easier one clear hurdles pediatric trials may already much higher manufacturing capacity. better flu shot around 40-60% effective. think helps put things perspective. Next year highly effective vaccines work strains too. get one later get booster new strains necessary. perfect far better nothing.

Disclaimer: I'm expert. I'd interested could find lawyer (who employed EU Commission) thinks AZ stronger position contractually. legal commentary seen far agrees me. Astrazeneca see that's working out. far able meet high production numbers. choose vaccine J&amp;J dam right I'm taking Johnsons. Yes 72 percentage cbut that's better vaccine zero percent. Still really comparable 95% trial, doubt double blind.    fall likely Actually, good enough. 60% protection 100% protection death hospitalizations. Likely MRNA vaccines given increased baseline efficacy. Seems we’ll able lick SA variant vaccines, great news. conflating bacteria antibiotic resistance viruses, same.  ""This electric chair 34% effective rubber suit. Sure die, still hurt like hell probably leave lasting effects.""

Coronavirus vaccine. 2 weeks later, know vaccine something else caused reaction? whelmed J&amp;J news.

I don’t see normalcy coming 2021 way SA variant resists vaccines. Seems like shots will
certainly lower cases deaths significantly, levels get concerts, restaurants, travel back. would take it. think younger people would fine. Even fifties highblodd pressure overweight,  think 66% reduction severe disease would serve me.. reducing deaths right novel virus inexperienced treating threatens overrun hospitals. likely eradicate virus either way begin mutate antibody escape forms either way. priority reducing deaths hospitalizations now.

&amp;#x200B;

It also work binary, resistant strains likely infect people vaccine severely (see novavax data SA variant still seem cause severe disease vaccinated population). vaccinate everyone way protects severe disease likely reduce deaths dramatically worry producing boosters different variants. forget 66-80% efficacy calculated relatively short period time, less two months. vaccine likely give protection time. Together fact none people vaccinated J&amp;J vaccine died covid, makes thrilled it. would even lower rest world would cause fire break transmission. seems like 1-dose marketing ploy, effective vaccination regime.

Still, refrigeration major benefit. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* think AZ even need rely force majeure clause. used best reasonable efforts commit delivering vaccines strict liability basis safe alone. It’s amazing anyone Eu still listening public health measures all. EU wants crash economy. Definitely, that's main point - imperative. mean huge reduction transmission something celebrate vaccine turns good too. early data crunching Israel hopeful I've long time. guess I'd let hope bleed hopes one. Still thrilled another good weapon arsenal. Yes, do. Yeah except that's parents see it. want high schools open 'socialization' really code want parent. 

SPED 504 students able go school, normal mainstream gen ed kept home. That's happening high school level across country though, putting many teachers risk minimal gains. That's question. think Moderna Pfizer 58% one shot, J&amp;J 66%. current vaccines effective new strains, J&amp;J drops 57% course 🙄 No, EU back queue delayed months looking blame prepared. Spin way want. concern makes low efficacy vaccine defacto vaccine people offered.

Yeah, since J&amp;J way behind production till case. help even bit, EU produces ingredients without problem. 

EU signed bad agreement, corruption and/or government pressure UK agreement broken AZ. AZ must punished, vaccine export must banned. Enough enough. EU save rest world price lives.

BoJo trying hide vaccination numbers. Right now. anecdotal stories organ damage mild cases extremely rare yet proven sort massive study. I've told management hospital work masked distanced 2021. Obviously change, necessarily practiced general public, life back ""normal"" time soon Low oxygen would also considered severe illness, even drop point need hospitalized. Someone correct I'm wrong, also case like Pfizer trial.  talking America, agree it’s going tough even here. 

If J&amp;J prevents hospitalizations, that’s good enough worldwide pandemic. Granted lot people scoff, wear kn/n95 already. time vigilant race vaccine. Prevents hospitalizations aka data point matters I'm gonna argue you. depresses well sucks you. understand well, like would need injected there's possibility could get sick. like... bit unethical?  ""Buy rumour, sell news"" action. endless lockdowns? Shits open fam Yes! Specially considering many older people Israel, testing positive mean symptomatic.

People tested regardless symptoms contact known carrier. so? border Lebanon, Syria, Jordan Egypt. would consider countries Western right? UNless speaking geographically guess? They're obviously referring New Zealand. Pfizer beginning partner production us vaccination without representation! can't relate dream-state feeling. Everything seems pretty real me. feel disconnected social way. Nearly social connections got severed due response pandemic. isolating time. gets me. Yeah sure ""heads would certainly roll""... least countyr surrounding ones pretty much point screw people things much want. ttoally fuck things like Czech Republic need lie lot lose precisely 0 votes... unbelievable people lost sense reality morality... 1.7 million shots reported US today. encouragement offset disappointing SA/Novavax result. true ""A months"". We're saying now, saying May, saying September. idea EU managing control anything hilarious. why, misinformation. blamed Belgium plant. happened before. Iceland least one incident like (IIRC quite few) early pandemic citizen returning trip Europe.

As long variants high levels infection, people getting infected one variant. guess issue is, won’t know hospitalization reduction figure time know efficacy figure. Oh god know? That’s good point hadn’t thought need apologize. Thank taking time share I’m glad alive, hope know mean that. feel anger it’s justified, like, nearly lost life every day others selfish. Even survival, didn’t even care ask could others may previous position. 

So else protect cancer survivors? one never go feel sick know others do, simply lack paid-time country healthcare abysmal. even then, don’t great job still get 14 days needed. get people's arms ban travel South Africa Brazil? Also vaccine distribution actually zero sum game. US vaccinate many people countries left out. Hmm get Sinovac (50%), Sputnik vaccine (75%), Pfizer (92%)? map history books

I understand checking history books, MAP? know nations are? effect now, least know US trial go well too! unrealistic almost 4% population (6.5k 163k) gets infected 10-day window, think safe assume unvaccinated population much larger. 

You correct, rate past two weeks roughly 8,000 per day = 80,000 per 10 days = 0.9% entire population. Who's moving goalposts now?

And focusing vaccine actual material conditions schools, teachers are, know work. know we'll get fucked raw go back EVERY safety measure resource campus, paper. really hanging hat ONE case? Surely understand that's statistically meaningless? need prove vaccination random-ass person? don’t mean dream state good way, mean way feel depersonalized. wish would become systematic efficacy % ""preventing hospitalizations"" % would given press releases. I'm sure places, hospital got mine at, make wait 15 minutes leave, nurses site. imagine many places like well, would hope.  Shhhhh! Nope. whole pandemic made life even real, least me. changes saw entire world year bring right back earth ever sort cloud dream state. There's always desire simplify things one binary rating, realistically never simple. pointed out, well daily messaging first wave NY. everything else, much. three arguments bunk.

1. vaccines 95% effectiveness original strain actual Phase 3 data says 50% SA strain. vaccines get body make antibodies. matters vaccines creating antibodies old strain effective new strain different spike protein.

2. Maybe, although people making way much deal seeing people hospitalized whether vaccinated not.

3. No, 60% effective vaccine never goal. FDA would approved it, that's anyone hoping considering effective vaccines viruses. 50% vaccine simply effective enough achieve herd immunity see every year flu vaccine. 1/3 protection compare took vaccine? There’s problem. want 100% guarantees world NOBODY getting that. 

95% pretty damn good though, especially coupled decrease severe Covid, well established fact children 12 drive infection first place. Stealing ?

How steal something already paid ? thought mass non-compliance we've along. already spread worldwide, nobody knows issue. does, we'll vaccine soon. Failing economies ?

You mean like Wales ? received shit ton money EU ? fun bailing failing country. upside, soon lot less worry about, Scotland N. Ireland soon bail.

Your mighty empire shrivelled, soft flaccid like old dick.

Time cure delusions grandeur. low grade fever, chills, body aches over, tired AF, headache today yesterday. So, I'm already feeling like flu first one, that's I'm worried ""the second worse"" rumors. I'm sure Covid would worse whatever thing throw me, regrets, want better prepared 2nd one. right, thus far, one become hospitalized died second dose.

But second dose arms everyone wants return normalcy. thoughts exactly. important figure watch hospitalizations. that’s reduced new variant, well. Israel organising well vaccinations. \[the USA\]: hunt different web sites mostly announce future announcements. site flashes time slots, seconds answer till filled. no-shelter/no-seat waiting, hours. Israelis lazy. nothing till called. computers Six states 10% (Alaska 15% lol), five 9%. bad. Greedy people getting two us even one! true - past year’s behavior surprising us medical conditions years burden us protect nobody else bothers to. bloody disgraceful.

not really... Healthcare workers vaccinated first level importance risk face. 65 high mortality rate relative everyone else would actually disgraceful vaccinate young healthy folk basically amounts peace mind average middle aged teacher. double-edged sword ""covid deadly everyone,"" yes helps discourage risky behavior, people frankly irrationally scared death virus, especially low risk schools many relative precautions like walmart mcdonalds Massachusetts's biggest problems vaccines seems state itself. health stakes""...

The stakes high life this.  didn't, understand that's confusing concept. Read full sound like EU trying block exports order make slowness. sounds like want allotments laid contracts prioritized shortfall, comes non-EU orders, fair enough.

So they'll ban exports company cannot meet contractual agreement. can't, prioritise EU deliveries exports. that's case, like Pfizer Moderna, bans. EU punishing countries made orders later, punishing company's cannot meet agreed upon supply. check long-term side effects usually issue? I'm suggesting case, curious factor vaccine tests. widespread rapid testing come in. add regular arsenal, get vaccines, probably keep masks, numbers go low enough contain contagious people allow others higher degree freedom. Anecdotally medical professionals know older folks seem tolerate second dose much better younger people. Many friends thirties forties getting kicked 48hrs second dose. US strongest libertarian culture planet

Yeah, definitely affect leaders are.

It's complicated saying statement, two connected. never time ""everyone vaccinated"", certainly ""end year"".  proven possible, want it. Especially elites allow us would cost money instead ruining small businesse own. absolutely right also absolutely wrong. lack leadership US fed denial crowd contributed heavily outcome. Good leadership necessarily eliminate contingent people would damn sure helped reduce it. 'failure' significantly better many vaccines use regularly diseases. Risking death grown men chase silly little wobbly ball around... create vaccine, Oxford team did.  trial mess. That's EMA approved yet. That's FDA ordered new trials. that's Germany said give 65s.

Oxford actually trail. AZ currently running one put results soon. worldwide numbers? That's problem, unfortunately problem too. 

They want every last bit life pandemic never happened compromises whatsoever. 

I'm thankful vaccine, least far, guarantee getting hospitalized killed covid. 

I know single example entire planet someone got days past 2nd dose subsequently got ill hospitalized died. could wrong seen anything yet. Why. ""Mental health stakes""...

Lol.. Let's see source 100% efficacy 100% time midst constant potential exposure dozens human beings room hours time. lmao  argentinian government approved vaccine claiming read phase 3 preliminary results. mexican government close approving it, say already read phase 3 preliminary results. cant imagine single reason Gamaleya wouldnt release results, dont get it. transparent scaring lot people Ok flown anywhere.  I've road trips.  within hundred feet non household members except gas stations stops, masked those.  Still, know that's lot people would go.  made choice.  regret that, dangerous activities I've engaged in. (A outdoor gatherings less 8 people couple restaurants strict precautions employed).  honestly sure would made year otherwise, idea another year top (or sorry, ""a months""), something inside becomes resistant.

When mental health issues going this, COVID aggravates them, COVID becomes less scary relative threats well-being. survival point. Tom Hanks Sports. People like, “Oh might real” U.K. EU sites agreed neither case operating yet.

It’s true EU hasn’t finalised agreement they’re apparently quite close, idea lead supply delays. exactly. several outbreaks they've controlled.

Immunization course goal starts next week. Thank vaccinating. less effective immune system 99.97% recover. also HCQ Ivermectin almost 100% effective used early!

99.97% recover ""fully"", number significantly lower. Source: long-hauler, still problems. probably best QB matchup Super Bowl history Aaayyyyyy. Good stuff sure New Jersey well many teachers huge risk, let 65+ severe preexisting condition teachers wfh stick everyone else classroom. pack fast food grocery workers together like sardines minimum wage, tell young healthy teachers held different standard, especially every precaution taken. get teachers fear health, (somewhat irrationally imo), every person job get benefit. Kids getting screwed home, far handful teachers want sit around sweatpants basically talk screen. Yes, start towards end year evenone vaccinated  include broken-down data SA trial.

It 4400 participants total SA trial, 200-300 HIV+. numbers good confidence interval -- really need way data drawing conclusions (both data shared trial larger trial SA variant). Getting better. Slowly surely doctors canceling appoitements due Covid. EVERYTHING, taken back seat Covid virus. Exactly, doubt Pfizer Moderna, 60% SA strain. around same. I've posted 3 different threads, yay!

Nah, guardian pro-eu previous agreements"" normal legal speak big deals. Europe greatly improved production capabilities.

I sure Canada profit well!

I root us, everything goes perfectly! gen Z... look comments sub.... Sydney 4 minor outbreaks, Adelaide one Melbourne second minor one. stopped quickly.  certainly give shit replying.... I’m lucky enough White Castle nearby. college would drive 2 hours crave case. Yup 20% real low estimate, 30% sounds right. EU finished negotiations sign 200M contract month ago announce contract. take longer next week likely. Approval March guess grocery pickup since Thanksgiving. Plus employer insists almost workplace transmission (haha! Sure! shortage cases people wear masks desks) 

Anyways, point is: less people, better. previous years indication, Biden might commit sort atrocity like wearing tan suit Hopefully not. Even slightly people able catch virus, enough immune response (because vaccine) get mild cold symptoms, that's worth keeping world shut down. remember right, studies done Israel showing even people catch covid shots easier time it. That's literally small sample size tough conclude anything data. Ahem, AMERICA BAD

I accepting everyone's gold please thank Yep exactly. I'm concerned winding dead debilitating health problems COVID. I'm terribly concerned ""mild cold"" version COVID. get media exposure, prepared declared anti-science morons everything wrong America.

Because that's going go down. Can't miss never Hahah, isn’t news me. selling vaccine cost, ""best efforts"" stipulated throughout contract? Pfizer profiteering, charging 7x cost Astrazenica jab, AZ jabs permeate third world, storage supply chains difficult maintain. production delays vaccines. UK experienced delays pfizer AZ Q4 last year.

&amp;#x200B;

Grow up. didn’t say South African variant? Isn’t Dr ask exercise babies legs get vaccine? Moving muscles helps remove soreness. important variable neglect little thing called denominator. measure vaccine efficacy, divide vaccinated infection rate unvaccinated infection rate. 

It's particularly unforgivable study actually attempt measure efficacy, mention period time, 8,250 new cases COVID-19 emerged control group 900,000 people diverse health profile. inoculated therefore 11 times likely get disease immunized, showing 92% effectiveness. Variants potentially could concern. That's scientists investigating Moderna even exploring boosters, case needed future. abnormal us -- we're used getting flu shots every year. 

As stands, people concerned variants far vaccines standing well, especially mRNA vaccines. Pfizer showed curbstomps SA variant. didn’t answer question, shame. solution doesn’t abuse entire generation children? highest quality data ability new strains evade immunity original virus. lol. yeah right. Stfu sit down. Note said at/near mean wouldn’t want nasal spray times day, know I’ve got run store something would nice know I’ve got added layer potential protection mask. wouldn’t trust completely stop virus without mask bar without research. Cases/Hospitals/ICU beginning practically free fall. Last week 3 day weekend, deaths lag time spent intensive care also counties pick records tally deaths many weeks old. Deaths plummet next week, mathematically it’s going happen. Feb 1 going look much worse March 1. getting there.  Yup Exactly. one said pandemic would two weeks. That's goalpost internet made up.

Fauci said last April would bad winter wave, far couple weeks. 500,000 dead success story I'm really happy you. feel? No, absolutely doesn’t. did, many diseases would eradicated. You’re also completely discounting changing nature viruses, zoonotic transmission, human nature. 

Also, weren’t saying wanted finish sprint? you’re asking for, without doubt, would take years even attempt, again, it’s endeavor 100% destined fail. 

Start reading virology epidemiology bit better understanding noble goal impossible riding cardboard box Mars. Yes kill america bad

I see flawed logic there. once, flying ultralight aircraft, encountered flock cranes trying fly south lost direction. decided help them. flew several hours made sure arrived going. True story. That's actually going help much since Brazil South Africa strains stopped antibodies original strain. fucked around long we're basically back starting point. need implement strict lockdown (much stricter anything US yet seen) cases start explode month two. I'll get 100 downvotes saying it, truth. Letting cat bag, closing barn door horses escape, etc.

We crushing Covid.

We crushed Covid therefore cannot crushed immediate future. 

Big difference. also super easy math.

Plus something happened promised 200M got 190M he'd hailed massive failure GOP. Better set overachieve goals we've promising moon delivering dogshit Trump CO.  passed least week

Just clear -- people passed week time getting second vaccination. definitely read ""passed on"" aka died.  underestimating stupidity Trump voters. Yes know complained that. answer giving showing us many doses Scotland many coming going disprove anything Davidson said though. would showing us wrong evidence.

That's there's benefit publishing there's massive consequences


Edit: also believe question Ruth asking 175,000 used vaccination centres got high levels vaccinations care homes. People aren’t even trying understand Fauci trying say acting outraged regardless.

People understanding saying, think incorrect.

The reasoning he's using data particular vaccines particular disease, plenty data vaccines diseases. Furthermore, runs counter formulating phase recommendations recommended vaccinating essential workers prior people 65+ based assumption would reduce spread disease. clearly comfortable making assumption before.

Then there's one simple fact, people told things can't go back normal vaccine. They've told months. vaccine entering circulation, we're told still can't go back normal. He's getting hate people feeling like getting jerked around. New Zealand already serious doubts dipshit country get shit together enough ever crush COVID.

I'm calling buuulllshit this. People barely handling now, expect last another year. data shows it’s less 0.5% getting downvoted, that's I've reading too. Plenty people warning things could get bad March. idiot worrying it. literally evidence started wet market. widely reported media authorities quick shut down, patient zero came wet market. suggests convenient close something call situation control fact origin pandemic much harder pinpoint. neither scientific community. see sensationalist news organization spouting non-peer-reviewed information even printed yet consequently. [We've known origins quite time thing. notice Cambodia sudden becoming epicenter pandemic? world power? seems headline trying weakly imply something. ""nearly identical"" belong scientific discourse, fuel fire Court Public Opinion. literally providing vaccine cost.

That means make zero profit dose, matter sell to. phase 2 trial participants. still.. No. headline deceptive. measure efficacy vaccine need compare vaccinated group control group nearly identical except vaccinated. Put another way: know many people would gotten sick without vaccine.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: study, actually try measure this. period time, 8,250 new cases COVID-19 emerged control group 900,000 people diverse health profile. inoculated therefore 11 times likely get disease immunized, showing 92% effectiveness.

If anything, shows slightly lower efficacy Pfizer originally measured.  Well Mom receive second dose next month 14 days I’m masking heading Tennessee. I’ve stuck home 300 days think deserve go live life. Please read again. 

They say still pass even vaccinated. 

This affect lives friends family way. hear  Keep mind SA variant, vaccine met original goal vaccine development. Hitting 60% initial bar clear. turned mRNA vaccines completely freaking ROCK. Prettier classroom? Lmfao get guy here. know first thing schools run. Thank God ain't call   Edited post. 85% UK strain. South Africa strain apparently less effective against. novavax press release. Thing Pfizer Moderna tested original strain. suspect Canada upped order 76 million doses earlier bad news side, see vaccine one candidates already rolling review health Canada (only Janssen AstraZeneca are). suspect still ways away getting approved Canada. necessarily relate third person thing. still feel like I'm me, like film placed entire life making everything feel bit foggy time, makes sense. Like I'm never alert, tired bit less responsive stuff overall. See, feel like I’m gaslighted I’m told that, contrary actual feelings, must actually love social distancing I’m willing break quickly. actually real bothers say that, think lot people assume me. it’s fucking fair. It’s different anti maskers said must love mask insist everyone wears them. No, don’t love mask, wear end pandemic quicker see disappear entirely quicker. I’m honestly sickened rhetoric adjusting pandemic realities must *actually* love it.

I feel like one shot resuming old life going thrown away everybody going now. want stay inside like it, hate it, I’m scared death activity lead opportunity squandered. Genuinely. no, 0.04% 100k people *one health insurance company* tested. Winning! Plenty ""kids"" 2x-3x size.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* really *really* hope right see mutations escape vaccines. i've pretty optimistic since beginning fall seeing result today kinda freaked out. So, solution, erase least 2 1/2 years education social interactionfor absolute vulnerable among us, want prettier classroom?

Teachers think like absolutely wrong profession. Yeah decides difficult she’s getting reported. I’m slightly older student (mid-20’s) don’t put much crap “authorities” used to. shaping pretty shit class general (confusing lectures, confusing project requirements, bad communication) someone probably going end hearing it. idea learning going distance hyperbolic. def age access, it’s like there’s zero instruction going home. It’s certainly ideal, sub par year isn’t worst happen. didn’t spend 60 hrs lesson planning grading reason.

you build cohorts kids need school fail allow spacing less students school, allow kids make bubbles socialization one two houses, actually put funds provide home WiFi laptops. provide goddamn funding mental health help lacking since forever.

teaching done degree distance, especially older kids. essential jobs can’t. hell yes give vaccines money protection you’re gonna force go work too. Information news rarely help feelings anxiety. Take care yourself. Oh ok channel little bit ago reporting unknown extent vaccine efficacy may change SA variant. Australia longitudes nations traditionally considered Eastern, like Japan, Korea, Vietnam China. What?

PS: agree AU NZ ""Western"" nations. look map/the globe. hometown 90 minutes everyone know still calls basically protest lol.  Same. conflicting feelings it. I’m mad behaving way are, also FOMO. think it, want left out?? comes it, wish never learn shit friends content still level would allow us truly stomp virus. That's matters. something hovering really low, would disappointment. stands, clears bar helping us bring end pandemic. one going idiotic expect to. life going back normal I'm vaccinated. Thanks info. Appreciated. got first dose (Pfizer) today. Pain injection site negligible. got headache within hour getting vaccine. Ibuprofen didn’t seem help much headache, it’s starting subside 12 hours later. also muscle soreness, despite taken ibuprofen continually headache. I’m usually perfectly fine flu shot, I’m little surprised feel crappy, make little nervous second dose. I’m 35 healthy. Germany's situation never anything like Australia New Zealand given open borders never got community transmission. They're talking Novavax. result still solid overall. Media likes harp deviation spun negatively views clicks. Covid Tracking Update: 16% last Tuesday, hospitalizations 13%, deaths 3%. Yeah use hospitalisations metric country bankrupt people... 50% effective South Africa trial... ingredient allergic to? would one even find that? Hi! got Pfizer vaccine got 2nd dose week ago! stronger reaction second shot. first dose felt soreness injection site, went away &lt;48 hrs later. Now, 2nd dose, feel much pain got shot 4-5 hours later felt intense fatigue. went bed woke back pain joints aching. kinda felt sense taste smell diminish really thought Covid husband reminded could reaction vaccine lol 
Symptoms went away 48 hrs later too. 
Oh tested positive antibodies 10 days got 1st dose!! reduction efficacy disappointing rather efficacy level depend local situation, think. What's norm area? anything enforced? yeah man, right you. look depersonalization, might relate lot symptoms. Quote article “Transmission SARS-CoV-2 occur within school settings clusters reported preschools, primary secondary schools.”

Did even read it? NJ teachers say hi finally someone understands. literally can’t even imagine scenario around people. sucks Pfizer said 50% less antibodies Moderna said 83% less antibodies. world that, ""slight""? ended lot patio heaters, one weirdest leadership decisions I've seen thus far. many people work. Psychologically current conditions lot people live particularly abnormal hard manage. suspect collective mental health time low result. Exactly.

60% SA variant 89% others really great situation. twisting words? said effects vaccine transmission needs study, nothing changed.

He simply urged caution, people like seem knee-jerk reaction warnings. Mom watching one cable news networks says said one vaccines PLUNGES efficacy SA variant? talking about? see nothing. think msnbc watching happens many people refuse vaccine.

I care. point everyone wants vaccine get it. on, everything allowed. anti vaxxers want die preventable disease, let them.  look like that, UK. bit on, US! Well damn. really idea.

I want check myself, lot article links I'm getting mostly pretty iffy sources. Happen good article two catch this? He's right though. like Trump know that. 

I swear website gets like followers every day, tbh Eh, relaX. Even would vaccinate now. would STILL lockdown summer! 

They lift restrictions may anyway, need better weather. like last year. Summer basically without restrictions. large events got cancelled. would anyone want vaccine 66% effective two 90%? place ever arrested lol... i'm gratefull mRNA vaccines, 66% sadly quite disappointment :( US ordered 600 million shots mRNA vaccines (Moderna &amp; Pfizer) right? safe assume large majority population getting J&amp;J vaccine approved? Hahahaha. seem German username decision refer Biontech vaccine. Could give insight German people feel whole spat? general impressions have. hasn’t around long enough us truly know “long term deficiencies” link scientific research paper got information from? heard sooo many times. rise cases Portugal new variants. proof this? Ireland claimed thing clear fraction due Kent variant. December. recommendation December. Anyway, anecdotal videos like say *nothing* behaviour whole. Also file ""Good News""!

It looks like recent Stay Home order worked! What’s confusing - can’t virus still spread even vaccine protects illness?

I’m confused whether vaccines protect infection illness. April 30 suddenly becomes July 30 turns October 31 goalposts moved  Maybe stupid question - could take J&amp;J vaccine use Moderna South Africa variant booster shot that's development? Well people vaccinated, less virus spread. get timing right get enough people late spring lots UV hot people rush inside A/C crowd together breathing everyone else's air, summer things could start look normal. 

Personally going wearing KN95 years public week goes covid even mentioned news trivial getting annual booster shot like flu. Great article, thanks posting it. thought useful countries lacking freezers/funds needed Pfizer moderna great tool US nations need offer type protection mRNA vaccines administered all.

If keeps people going hospital dying, triumphant step. Definitely agree you. statement little contradictory nonsensical. invented NEVER EVER something like compensate them. wish people right thing like are. Good parent! f not, likely zero protection.

Thats medical professionals telling us. possible fibbing get people take guess. AZ might able manufacture J&amp;J given they're type vaccine, Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax completely different tech. EU getting criticised behaviour response situation, rather putting hands admitting faults trying make UK AZ enemy distraction. Literally nobody took go hospital one died! amazing! rejoicing available 1 shot without temperature restrictions. Like taking crazy pills! ahh let people live now..it's outside too. done year, working what's point People already gather. Remember holidays? 

But good policy people often aligned. That's whole reason laws policies -- corral people's less societal impulses. It’s return flights home. 

Imagine person returning home California Michigan. Covid test positive. what? Tell book hotel couple weeks drive home? 
Cool.

Good luck.  Teachers higher priority local store bag boy...both front line valuable human being...get line according age health direct care health workers. least other. AZ shipped vaccines it’s EU factories cover British obligations well, informed EU fail meet EU’s quota, I’m mistaken.

Otherwise banning export would non-issue. issue vaccine literally miracle everyone needs STFU enough. 3 effective vaccines within year- wow everything sucks bad terrible apparently? dont get people! worth getting protection now- gauge whether need pfizer offered you- may well pandemic control cheap! KF94 masks bought eBay $2-$3 per mask. Moderna also delivering EU. Less 10% Pfizer, instance. Anyone knows happening? Pandemic would probably 2 years vs. 1.5. 

Govts may try &amp; keep restrictions longer time, eventually, probably 2 year mark would start quietly going away people would stop listening. 

It'd like Hong Kong moving OG SARS. People sort started getting back life. There's article New Yorker, someone stated one morning went reach mask thought ""do really need now""? 

It sort fizzled. rather

Individual Freedom vs Collective Benefit


Blind Optimism vs Reality wasnt big deal because, among things, smartphones social media endemic beginning it, friend 50% figure efficacy Sinovac includes asymptomatic cases

the 66% figure J&amp;J symptomatic covid

it fair comparison Would even work? wife wearing since last February. concern may allowed travel eu vaccine approved EMA Meanwhile 75 year old parents still sitting WV waiting phone call get vaccine.... highest active cases India right now. MH disappointing. Delhi would Amit Shah intervene. kejri take credit. long think majority vaccinated still need wear masks? saying CNN morning, get whatever vaccine get ASAP get J&amp;J go ahead get mRNA vaccine later supplies up. I’d gladly take 65% protection couple months upgrading. Perfect enemy good whatnot I'm hoping two shot could prioritized high risk individuals. one shot becomes general mass vaccination two shots get used risk pop. days username appropriate 😅😂 meant insult, funny haha. struggling understand point. much Hungarians vaccine passed clinical trials employed bunch countries. media fear mongering lies tie well. Fox CNN etc culpable one bad NYT. 

Also massive amount mixed messaging straight lies CDC, Fauci, etc masks (look like Fuaci get lie lie) also validated lot people distrusted government scares most. It’s reason I’ll sticking one mRNA vaccines, assuming get choice matter. going say ""Madea gets Moderna"", turns got Pfizer vaccine. According methods, severe category symptoms basically defined symptoms; requires bed rest results loss work, school"" etc.


Whereas ""potentially life threatening"" category similarly consistent criteria several symptoms: unable perform basic self care functions""



Honestly, though, think people would struggle differentiate serious critical/life threatening symptoms. unless member family clinical experience medicine, would imagine people bedridden days end hospitalized.



TLDR: ""serious"" cases according study mean patient bedridden / unable function, require hospitalization recover. 3 weeks second vaccine, week supposed immune. thing is, 1 week people, 0.04 got sick. 0.04 people exposed virus. Good news USA, able choose. Anywhere else, I'm afraid stuck AZ J&amp;J similar. Dude say it: “people listening made worse”. course anybody could see level resistance coming fucked messaging. binary choice:
“It’s hoax!” Versus “if get virus die! Life knew over! Get inside”

If not, likely zero protection. sorry, healthcare worker antivaxxer?

Skilled vs smart stop misleading statement? Canada contracts many doses, doses exist. US fully vaccinated June Canada maybe 10% population vaccinated wonder much theoretical doses help.

Maybe US protect Canada give AZ doses won’t need promising late spring, lot signs shortfalls throughout Feb. may still tough winter least light end tunnel. Yeah, that’s exporting. EU issue Belgium plant might exporting vaccines UK... wants UK - exporting vaccine made it. Crazy enough infected billion year. Obviously way less bad Covid, case numbers plastered everywhere 24.7 back perception would hace wayyyy different thing top though, high quality masks worn properly even better.

We tools, know isolate, people supposed to. new variants really going mess people take situation seriously. beard act good filter. /s

But seriously, reason I've shaving regularly get good seal. Nope, Pfizer crazy requirements. ^this. Exactly. Wonder stack. get Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J get 255% immunity? long 1 higher lose immunity person next gets 1%. Yes both, long respect plane/local/business procedures dont feel sick Well usually pays snacks I’ll pay food usually get $10 snacks. I’m also one ask makes sense I’d pay ya know? :) fear advances would put lot evolutionary pressure viruses, would speed rate mutation produce viruses resistant modern tech. know, still it’s crazy don‘t even export neighbor fellow NAFTA member. easier cheaper send truck Michigan Canada packing plane dry ice fly Switzerland/Belgium definition severe, hospitalized? use N95 Taiwan, use medical grade masks also include electrostatic layer like N95, CDC says [disinfected rice maker used multiple That’s even true. U.K. provided literal recipe vaccine India produce millions doses themselves. 

We need start looking aggregate. 
Moderna/Pfizer: vaccine truly vulnerable dying high rates. 
Novavax: People fall outside high risk want bump bit (think 50+)
J&amp;J: bulk adult population, 18-50. people large clear virus little difficulty. 

All prevent hospital visits somewhere 95% range. 

For unlucky trouble vaccine standard treatment, steroids, monoclonal antibodies, whatever therapies find come play. Monoclonals play big part. They’re like fire extinguisher. Right they’re rage we’re fighting warehouse fire like it’s Backdraft. damp grease fire kitchen, much effective. things control stock higher?

r/wallstreetbets covered. people aware long-term effects, let alone care them. I'm guessing around 1% total population, reddit representative. J&amp;J storage requirement Moderna. AZ seems magically finding more

More getting made every day, production never stopped. ""The real problem AstraZeneca doesn’t work expected, little information,” told foreign correspondents

Europe understand, however. hope spring pessimism starts lift, need start going back normal soon possible. Can’t keep catering “safe” defined hypochondriacs never satisfied. would say real world, people already vaccinated takes less care experiment, ignore whether received real thing. would expect 92% biased downwards. Look get date everybody

*And* afford snacks. Break Moet &amp; Chandon didn’t doubt effectiveness even 66% wanted make sure this. Thanks outlining :)

You’re 100% correct it’s better nothing. We’re lucky position. Dakotas herd immunity already?
In India pretty much herd immunity much even doctors taking vaccines hardly cases. Positivity rates less 1% But... efficacy reported vaccine candidate 85 percent effective preventing severe disease across regions studied, [i] 28 days vaccination adults 18 years older.

I also confused. time, sure certain age risk go ahead I'd rather wait months different vaccine thats approved EMA/FDA.

I'm well versed medical agencies UAE Singapore looking press freedom index I'd rather pass Exactly. help wonder planet author lives think fear higher before. barely know anyone wears mask anything now. anything, fear lower ever.  


Vaccines causing drop cases, fear virus. numbers amazing. 66% great, 100% effective preventing hospitalization death.

Across vaccine trials, I’m pretty sure one single person later infected admitted ICU, died, think even admitted overnight hospital (please correct I’m wrong).

**Hospitalization death rate 0%.** announcing people form agreement ""behind everyone's back""? 

The UK plants reserved initially UK doses brand new information come last weeks. 

I still see links Brexit way. issue exclusively EU AZ, nothing UK contracts vaccine providers. estimate humans. Everyone thinks they’re important person earth deserves best. 

If cancer don’t want go clinic. want best. real. I’m otherwise healthy 32 year old able get vaccine Texas overweight. It’s obscene teachers aren’t considered high priority along ahead state. mom teacher lied application saying high blood pressure she’s getting shot tomorrow. Thanks, worry. :). underestimate uninformed average person is. take whichever vaccine offered them, thank goodness. J&amp;J vaccine fine. Maybe, numbers dropping every state, including real restrictions I'm risking losing lung capacity get haircut.

I also cut hair year. 

It's getting really annoying showers. feel overheated longer. Mmmm Pret-a-vacciner could underlying conditions. don’t know why, I’m literally telling what’s said ministry Health. parents then.  think also demonstrates futility trying describe vaccine's efficacy single number. different number depending severity outcome time since shot. Everyone focused 66% 72% reported headlines results also say ""85 percent effective preventing severe disease across regions studied"" ""no cases vaccinated participants reported day 49"". many vaccines available (soon). young healthy male, given choice, one take? good sources read that? realize probably get vaccinated 2-3 months. live US ten miles Moderna, wife works grocery store exposed 1000 people day still vaccinated. you’re complaining doses long way existing. I’m office worker probably won’t get Autumn. it’s worth, bc keep working brought covid home last week it. 6 people house. Yeah hear I'm definitely advocating testing much possible. Also glad masks worked you, scary know many truly a-symptomatic. 

My main point though ton people trying draw narrative America somehow world leader testing that's reason numbers 'look' bad. reality deaths per capita also hospitalizations well, testing excuse claim somehow much better Europe. 

Appreciate info though I'm definitely still wearing mask waiting vax. Basically going public week keep spread down. Look socialite three months touchless... life *before* pandemic. 93% counts severe. would presumably O2 saturation 93-100 percent still categorized abnormal currently possible. countries invested research funding vaccine development get higher priority, trickles rest world factories infrastructures prepared. enough vaccine produced time.

If every country supplied once, would happen would slow rise number vaccinated place, gives virus time mutate make vaccine less effective. essentially happening pockets population vaccinated, effects building public support, allows safer production vaccines distributed countries higher populations.

 ideal world, would enough vaccine go around vaccinate everyone quickly once. possible yet, vaccinating slowly could cause issues effectiveness. wealthy country completes vaccination regimen, focus go vaccinating less wealthy country stop rampant competition provide support need less inside backlash. country also ordered paid Pfizer, I'm pretty sure trash give countries skip distribution administration costs. they'll go rich countries first. would case matter what.

What? talking about? vaccines going pace everywhere, accordance size county's population. THAT'S alternative. ""No matter what"" they'll go rich countries first

And that's countries place queue least get free.

I referring poor countries, countries North America Western Europe. getting free lol. talking Covax, mission provide vaccines 2 - 3% country's population enough healthcare workers. tslking lol Well Trump get full ""America First"" style contracts executive orders. main reason well countries.
It made complicated EU well , vaccines send around world coming right now. Experts said never going get vaccines protect recipients indefinitely. like flu, folks almost certainly need get seasonal shots protect new variants. That's ""crushing"" lol  People get hospitalized mildly ill, they? act like bad thing. course better vaccines used vulnerable populations. quite content old folks 10-15% chance dying getting better one, young healthy ass gets JNJ get us herd immunity much faster. worry we’ve conditioned fear thing last 12 months large chunk population resist reopening tell them, “you’ll
probably get eventually, it’s cold you’re vaccinated”.

My cable news addicted mom never accept odds. way. 95% protection yes, 60% no. dealing pandemic hard enough. deal Trump-sabotaged lack PPE country. I'm pretty sure everyone would wear mask actually mandatory. still do, people think themselves. see lot masks pre regulations? Well hope got it. I'm glad one use looked data make decision. got drunk signed something someone posted Reddit. even remember got email.

Stay safe! Glad talk. medical laboratory simple barn, adding extra people doesn’t automatically make work go faster. Well mean like 99 percent people get covid dont die already, good get shot hopefully get knocked ass weeks. Also, keep hospital numbers get back treating normal ailments. know secondary tertiary mean? COVID. mean website general, yeah, know targeted. thing is, Western kids (people aged like 14-25 whatever) already exceedingly pre-disposed distrustful authority. badge honor, really. important part psychological self-actualization anyway (although that's another topic). they're likely critical US larger authority, right?

So pair foreign actors already want critical US, get two groups reinforcing feeding other. that's reddit: place far left far right (to lesser extent) embraced. anything better ""status quo"" ""establishment"". is, ironically, exactly governments Russia, Iran, China, etc want break well. get everyone earth doesn’t want person stuck bargain bin version others getting high end one. 


Remember everyone thinks they’re important person earth. 


You’re going see pushback people saying no. people going risk vaccine side effects (whether true not) want make risk vs reward great possible. Considering yearly FLU vaccine ~40% effective, still good vaccine. yes, mRNA vaccines future vaccines MORE! Awesome news. let's get EUA within next week start distribution waste time! Honest answer: No. admit alarming dangerous, nobody win keeps escalating speed. First all, anything article? Also, “the US” “opening up”. states loosening restrictions areas restrictions getting tighter. federal level, restrictions getting tougher new administration travel still left states. flu mutates constantly info people still got long term side effects?  Exactly.  
I'd like keep parents alive, getting long covid lung damage, kids getting whatever strange side effects kids get. happens almost every winter, general management political problem specific pandemic related one. Hospital capacity never exceeded. many reasons excited JNJ, I’ll outline below:

1. It’s 1 shot vaccine instead 2 shot.

2. doesn’t require ultra-cold storage like vaccines do.

3. incredibly effective preventing deaths hospitalization, important metrics dealing pandemic.

4. US set receive 100 million doses vaccine June.

You say you’re afraid people refuse take this. disagree. vaccine largely it’s supposed to- drive deaths hospitalizations down. That’s enough people. Also, could easily argue people want vaccine others. all, there’s big advantage needing get 1 shot versus 2. consider freezers. Astra-Zeneca one need -70 good know That's I'm saying; important specify exactly happened. can't say prevented 100% hospitalizations cases people *should* gone hospital, able hospital accepting patients. going chasing tails strains thing next ten years. longer even bothered news. reason ordered many nobody crystal ball told vaccines would actually work. We've lucky get many effective. Rich countries hedged bets, means poor countries benefit vast amount free doses. people Covid flu. 40% get even get symptoms. outlier symptoms months after. im getting vaccinated sit inside house another year Prevents severe illness, still spread presumably. proven otherwise, hasn’t - speculation. Michigan relaxing ton restrictions starting Feb 1st. - totally agree you, I'm mainly ranting media grabbing whatever nummber fitting narrative ran it.

True, expect every vaccine 90+ effective mean remember scary first month two. said found therapeutics worked well brought death rates normal flu levels stopped caring. 

Here’s way view it. know 3 people got killed this.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Swedes generally masks, I'd say? we've told time time effective speculated. Like everywhere else, people wear unless they're told to.

I honestly see FHM say ""wearing mask might help"" back spring, left Wat really want know well vaccines protect “long haul” effects people experienced. someone 20s, I’m concerned reports people originally mild case COVID-19 experience serious sequelae (cognitive issues, lung damage, etc.) months later. 

I realize likely won’t information protection long-term issues quite while. looking forward getting inoculated! 66% efficacy excluding mild Covid cases. definition ""moderate"" covid pneumonia effing deep vein thrombosis. happy getting AZ, get chance get AZ, happy now. let people get down. Meditation helps too. AZ messed again. crystal clear UK plants part manufacturing infrastructure per 5.4. even named specific plants (in appendix). 5.1 AZ commits *try* produce vaccine within EU. also clause AZ certifies entered agreement could impede obligations. I'm signed US clinical trial get first shot next week. Really hoping real deal placebo group. initially signed phase 1 2 trials info released UK phase 3 underway. Glad see data looks good. Setting records! USA! USA! USA! least 50% efficacy doubt might wrong?

Anyway. QC:

""Under clause 5.4, AZ also obliged use RBEs manufacture Vaccine sites located within EU *and UK*, clause face affect obligation cl. 5.1 (which clearly confined manufacture EU)"" Well, [like go 0.01% chance getting symptoms? pulling number from. Cite that’s said. got spoiled Pfizer Moderna numbers. efficacy crazy high, much higher many ""traditional"" vaccines us gladly take. J&amp;J's numbers plenty good stalling pandemic, one-dose vaccine much simpler storage requirements offers significant advantages.

Now, perfectly honest, walked pharmacy three options sitting shelf pharmacist said ""pick one"", I'd probably choose either Pfizer Moderna. that's luxury right now. goal needs get vaccines many people possible, quibbling effectiveness damned. I'm able get vaccine, I'll take whichever one get. talk possibility offering everyone mRNA ""booster"" supply longer issue covid longer killing thousands people every single day. Eddie Murphy could join him, help promote Coming America 2. Help reach vital ""Black Guy Dressed Old Jewish Man"" demographic. Please sir, may drop vaccine? I've shitting years pocket corporations crazy populist rants, see benefits friendly towards corporations, really want benefits too!  i'll take I'm actually getting pretty tired fucking celebrities reassuring me. know would reassure me? using vaccines healthy, young celebrities every resource fingertips treatment could actually concentrate regular Americans sheltered homes awaiting available vaccine stock. 85 year old father-in-law 3 separate places trying get vaccine none available despite fact he's eligible month.

Tyler Perry need vaccine getting one himself...not anyone else...and vaccine could arm someone needs more. Celebrities need get back line, like everyone else, unless they're age eligible due health conditions.

Plus I'm black never never watch garbage. opinion, owes money Jim Varney's estate stealing schtick. Tyler Perry crappy black Earnest. barely stand even watch commercials Perry's garbage, sooo bad. actually hard believe much money guy made spewing heaps absolute garbage tv movies. Covid time fine around point. infection already present individuals. Yes allowing driving responsible car deaths.

Not sure point ? want take it, MVP high B/P, one gets dies. yhe question ponder daily age group called county. husband way older available soon. Yeah, everybody problems, tell honestly, vaccination operation probably thing government right crisis. prime minister cares keep sit, probably go prison loses. Please name countries. No. Find, please, another reason. all. sensational right wing news media, especially UK full ready EU blame mode. 

This literally time 6 years positive feeling Brexit. led propaganda. 

""beSt EffoRt ConTract""

Must pleasant live happy life justify people’s happiness ‘selfish’ appear base morals 'membership thuggish trade cartel makes life worth lives non members'. Lmao EU right. say UK first priority?

the EU also paid lot money develop vaccine contracts AZ (which get released today) promise deliveries Q1 UK pre-ordered first 100m doses facility.

The EU also pre-ordered 100mil doses seems thise doses supplied UK nothing else sell anyone.

Good thing EU made purchase last year hand, Pfizer facility Belgium contracts EU, UK, Canada, probably Israel. EU threatening block all. 

And foot, AZ facility UK contract EU UK threatening block UK's position expects paid for. EU's position willing take others paid for.

The EU's position expects paid for. UK's position willing take others paid for.


Everything wrote switched replacing UK EU pfizer AZ really matter EU said timing separate agreements AstraZeneca made UK EU irrelevant.  said: “Unless term agreements AstraZeneca must supply UK first, separate arrangement UK probably irrelevant arrangement \[European\] commission. first come, first   actually excerpts UK contract AstraZeneca? would good compare terms contracts. well essential one make sacrifices. Export controls would also particularly worrying Pfizer exports could limited meaning uk less supply lot people may receive 2nd Pfizer dose “on time”. Remember Pfizer 2nd dose extended 12 weeks anyway risky move itself. Madea Vaccination Clinic. want disappoint you, Israeli want add, take consideration people vaccinated week. need compare equal amount people timespan. Clearly live south. Humidity thing. say wear masks bus though. situations can't keep distance consider it. Like subway rush hour. morally right allow people UK die cover mistakes EU?

The EU blocking Pfizer exports kind clumsy extortion attempt would produce results expecting. think israel close 40% vaccinated issue see past year, experts health officials saying masks, even homemade cloth masks, one important measures coronavirus, they're like ""no, actually almost useless, need KN95"". 

It completely undermines credibility recommendations. major problem here. likely signed two conflicting contracts, going mean Eu take action export controls. vetenskapliga majoriteten 

Democracy science two different things, there's democracy *in* science.

Whether government acted correctly decided elections. hold similar values European counterparts economics foreign policy. Consider term ""Western"" modern day ""1st world"" ""developed"" nations hypocrites happy teenagers poor people risk loading cars hide Perhaps. Thanks guidance try reading abstract. Even author says tells us nothing except reasonable range effects masks err side benefit seems.

""Although difference observed statistically significant, 95% CIs compatible 46% reduction 23% increase infection.""

Edit: looking P values tipped inconclusive. imagine even Aus still constant general fear outbreak might happen grandma safe. 

Restrictions successful not. Every case restrictions work even work fantastic, still followed outbreaks. Australia NZ crushed slowing covid spread, can’t eradicate without heard immunity, thus can’t stop deaths eventually happening without vaccines

Good luck summer bros honest AZ messed big time. First trial data pretty insufficient breaching contract lack doses. next? exactly happen? europe sort permanent lockdown numbers pretty much remain stable slowly decreasing. EU isn't? need see full contract sure either way saying different things Aside injection site little sore, feel good. Lol yh um okay, see, plan everyone die one infect... Covid crushed, smart plan, lucky u got head start disingenuous cuntery highest order know it. get excited, end court. People laugh half country doesn’t care covid. 

I don’t think people understand it’s like people states restrictions. 

They aren’t scared covid like people subreddit. They’re living entirely different life people here. Covid hasn’t impacted them. Sure, know people got sick. may know old person two died, isn’t different every winter know people get sick old person died. 

They don’t constant anxiety. don’t constant fear economic collapse. don’t mental issues come social distancing isolation. 

They living normal life. 

The rest country starting realize that, it’s starting hit home people live places restrictions seem worse mentally, even touch economic collapse places see next decade, shut downs. 

American society quickly, mean quickly, shifting restrictions. come something like double masks, you’re going get laughed people. 

They’re done. 

And there’s nothing change mind. friends family places restrictions. cannot scare action everything said didn’t turn true. told restrictions needed, friends family showed happens restrictions don’t come. 

And prefer life much more. can’t find link cause it’s days old, Dr. Angela Rasmussen (one prominent Twitter epidemiologists) saying Twitter that’s much less likely virus flu differences two viruses replicate. flu tendency “mix match” there’s multiple strains one host coronaviruses don’t that. Thanks! 98 people died drowning NSW (sydney) last year, 54 covid. 

But get go skiing Japan last year, start go fund pity party? know nuthin bout Panthers. fail source distribute, company pretending can't make enough vaccines provide us quotas. hope that's true cause means someone else buying table price allow pay fines later. go then? august mean. 2019 christmas leave campus knowing LAST time ever student. still makes sad could say goodbye many years studying hard work closing chapter eating one last meal getting one last coffee campus. hope over. Even got Bacherlors degree still feels ""unfinished"". We'd stuck we'd joined EU initiative, something UK ridiculed time.

One elusive brexit benefits... interview published 26th. EU ask AZ explicitly publish contract? There's nothing internet EU asking AZ publish contract 27th January.

The president European Commission said initially ""best efforts"" contract, vaccine proven work, becomes contractual indeed committed supply certain amount vaccines, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said German radio. defense pharmaceutical company contract EU states must utmost correct, according committee chair.  so-called best effort clause applied period clear whether AstraZeneca could develop working vaccine. that, concrete quantities vaccine deliveries committed December 2020 first three quarters 2021, Von der Leyen said.  possible outsiders check interpretation contract correct; EU AstraZeneca agreed keep contract secret. EU wants get rid agreement. contract may still public today, say insiders, permission AstraZeneca required.  EU also working scheme stop export vaccines produced EU. suspected AstraZeneca solved production setbacks United Kingdom vaccines produced Netherlands Belgium, actually intended European market. EU paid AstraZeneca hundreds millions euros produce enough vaccine pending approval drug authorities. Later today, European Medicines Agency (EMA) decide whether vaccine approved use Europe.

 Source: 'AstraZeneca zegde EU wel vaccinhoeveelheden toe' - (Dutch) I've many debates people mask mandates Sweden. often tell people use masks correctly, mean ""the risks using masks outweigh risks using them"" ""hand washing social distance better"". often say hand washing social distancing important inform people use mask correctly, one thing helps prevent deaths infection.

I also hear ""masks cause people socially distance wash hands"", ridiculous proper messaging government, people informed better. 

Finally, hear, ""Other lands mask mandates still see high infection rates."" last one ridiculous masks infection rates one-to-one relationship many academic scientific studies say masks magic solution help save lives. 

It's maddening people educated know still anti-mask. need see terms UK contract well then. possible AstraZeneca fucked two contradicting contracts can't possibly fulfill both. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

It’s wrong point various generations resemble attitudes childhood young adulthood shaped masks answer, everyone knows. little part it, irrelevant measures place.

Check Spain Italy mask mandates since end summer, numbers way higher Sweden. 


Plus Norway Finland full mask mandate instance, successful measures masks needed. Also EU: guess published today. That's bit like saying China spike Italy originate there. think enough data rule out.

You seen graph France? spiked massively start November UK spiked December lockdown lifted. UK lockdown November. R rate lockdown 1 Nov.

We can't say confidence originate there.

UK Sweeden effective sequencing capability quickest find variants. Probably, hopefully, know yet much transmission decrease. goes without saying fucking EU still ""exploratory talks"". don’t think so. specifically states uk sites used supply Eu doses. I’m sure can’t really understand it. Best wait someone else analyse instead me. thought bit interesting  Why?

It appears display irrational loyalty thuggish trade cartel easily nation.   details find interesting? Ugh, many words  Ah....look New Zealand Australia! post bullshit! Let guess must American? give everyone vaccine, see shows transmission continue slow everyone gets vaccine. seems like 2 Month behind US.

Not great, terrible. Blocking export vaccines UK bought paid order extort UK government handing stocks vaccines bought paid bad. 😂🤣  1. would take years immediate impact
2. mean company would disappear completely. would taken someone else. Hopefully someone sell 80 mil doses know barely produce 30 mil. going clause, AZ correct everything except letting EU know shortages? Shalom They've redacted estimated delivery schedule lol. Contract states shall use manufacturing sites within EU UK fulfil contract... think makes sense context since believe also says protective benefits last like 20 minutes something .04% people ever get virus, people got specific time frame. article said people without vaccine 11 times likely get sick, shot .44% people without vaccine virus timespan. vaccinated everyone US, right time, we'd probably go 3000 people dying day 300, least while, hopefully since much less people sick, we'd much less interactions sick people, much less exposure, therefore much less deaths. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically.

They’re fulfilling contract probably 1 3 important EU now. regular company going care this, it’s unique situation. 

There’s large public interest aspect here. They’re blacking parts dispute. It’s EU wants out, AZ seem issue likely favorable AZ.

AZ worked EU like Pfizer did. Instead went PR offensive designed keep UK receiving allotment EU supposed pretend there’s preferential non-commercial issue play. We've cases small county. Got say, really sorry stuck overseas, also happy lowered inbound quota better handle quarantine hotels.   
Hope get home soon. EU vaccinating third states asap. ordered many vaccines surplus. I'd say really depends says contracts. counts, signed contract first whose country vaccines produced. AZ really mess promised UK EU rights vaccines produced uk plants, equal rights vaccines. indeed EU right vaccins. simple plants, vaccin.  know elementary school aged neice nephew spread family. past summer. quite significant clause:

“
6.2. Capacity Limitations. event AstraZeneca's ability fulfill obligations Agreement impeded competing agreement entered behalf Commission, AstraZeneca shall promptly inform Commission”.

It arguable AZ supply information promptly EU intended doses wouldn’t met rather left last minute. hand, EU rarely makes outrageous statements without ability back up. assume feel equally confident. 
 
As AZ. AZ said can't publish contract, would admitting EU right. 
 
Personal guess: There's leeway interpretation contract, think they're correct. decided legal scholars examine every line.  vulnerable live EU, presumably.  AKA going happen. sides thinking right lawyers exist... UK actually getting more. Try harder. course they’re complaining that. They’re benefiting it.

Doesn’t matter signed first, either. Another British queue argument matters it’s contract. It’s not. sign first come, first serve agreement. EU contract also references production sites including UK. UK receiving allotment EU shows non-commercial forces work EU understands. reality course UK prioritizing citizens AZ. said much won’t change. happy British government is, suppose.

Best efforts also doesn’t mean people think does. means unforeseen circumstance force majeure, normal production capacity issues within company’s control foreseeable.

The side wants publish contract portions EU, AZ. Yes, AstraZeneca overpromising throughout crisis. supposed tens millions doses ready UK end year? Says guy Denmark, bastion global economic military strength. Big difference UK EU. Also impact deaths. think study needed now. might actually cause people take covid-19 seriously.

So many men wear masks feel violates manhood.... Important distinction think want steal away production, would terrible thing do.

I think looking shared cut countries receiving vaccines production plants invested (so affect 4 facilities Europe). calculate cut % total promised deliveries countries, give everyone cut. study law? realize best effort means (or force majeur)? None things apply and, fact, clear schedules specific production sites (including UK) mentioned contract. 

So yes. best effort clause nonsense. UK nowhere near finished vaccinating vulnerable groups. comment fully legit turns EU right. 

And comment made EU Commissioner actually signed contract. knows fuck up. doubt anticipated would production issues labs continent. might cash incentives timely deliveries, penalties even. state coronavirus restrictions? Come Florida governor intercedes defang mitigation measures! Don’t want wear mask? That’s cool, certain small businesses bother enforce sneeze people heart’s content!

Florida, America’s COVID Escape^TM Absolute madmen Semantics. dunno, ask Palestinian leadership? 🍿 Oh, really? suddenly become adult

Not all. **everyone** supposed wearing 

Not Sweden, like way. “Novavax said Thursday vaccine found 95.6% effective original novel coronavirus, 85.6% effective variant first identified UK, known B.1.1.7, based results Phase 3 trial conducted UK. study included efficacy estimates strain based PCR tests performed variants 56 Covid-19 cases trial.
But vaccine appeared less effective variant first identified South Africa. shot showed 60% efficacy among without HIV separate Phase 2b study conducted country. efficacy dropped 49.4% HIV-positive people included.” It’s painful. Losing close friend one painful things go think. people always show eventually. Trolls idiots let small details like facts stop spreading disinformation lies.  Why? EU expected export vaccines UK?

ELIA5 pls. Actually many viruses including Covid also mechanisms tamp immune responses make successful. causes issues host mounting immune response eradicate infection. Autopsy data showed people died Covid significantly reduced response seen lymph nodes immune cells go mature. Covid also trigger autoimmune responses things like interferon causes worse symptoms patient. even someone Covid vaccine allows immune system trained recognize without interference live virus. still help get reinfected worse time second time around. Outstanding thoughtful post thank it. sounds reasonable. cooperating - nothing UK 1st grader teacher decided going 4 hour zoom day...every day. try add asynchronous work top it. We’re miserable. Also news, damn Israelis getting vaccines Syrians, Iranians Pakistanis. 

How dare they?! 'nonsense' suit EU imperialistic narrative.

The EU welcome find far bullying gets them. No. According contract UK plants must produce vaccines Europe. butcher shop Yes will. EU correct that’s truly idiotic clause mind. expect company supply chain built 4 months bit much guarantee deliveries would insane AZ agree to. 

Also like EU claiming delivery 0.5-4 million EU UK wrong expect UK help make shortfall 40+million. Seems quite hypocritical me, either customers claim factories helped fund neither can. Kids die this, yeah, care kids get sick. They're likely die flu, see upset they're person learning every flu season months UK already purchased UK's first 100m doses

So what? contract AZ UK UK bought repercussion contract EU EU ordered Pfizer doses shared facility (owned American company). threatening block exports it

AZ part swedish, make UK ordered doses facility paid construct, paid exclusive rights use it. There's nothing block doses already belong UK.

According EU sources AZ denied, contract EU supply includes british factories. UK paid exclusive rights AZ still sold doses factories rights mean AZ breached UK contract? EU nation, starters 61 healthcare, one level another, since 18. assure kooks highly educated. blow UK much bigger since mostly vaccinated elderly AZ. Maybe that’s numbers don’t go fast..

The STIKO, German authority vaccinations, completely separate government people, seem pretend one combined entity. even STIKO spreading antivax propaganda, stating recommend people 65. smart people STIKO surely valid reasons. even disagree, theres nothing antivax it.

The government everything promote vaccinations. 

Commenters like really make hate reddit sometimes. call bullshit . couple :

1.	⁠They leave negative imprint children
2.	⁠People take less care health breath like people don’t brush teeth wear masks
3.	⁠They reason political divide citizens
4.	⁠It dystopian shit seeing everybody wear masks
5.	⁠They fog glasses
6.	⁠Services like lip reading cannot survive masks many deaf people rely lip reading understand others.
7.	⁠Face masks hinder breathing bit, ain’t end world tbf.  This. EU's position one hypocrisy. 

On one hand say they'll stop exports EU-based facilities shortfall deliveries. hand, say they're happy take vaccines non-EU facilities make shortfall, even though facilities they're threatening take already shortfall obligations.

There nothing stopping UK taking measures blocking exports until, least, 90% shortfall resolved. 

Another example hypocrisy say want countries share shortfalls equally. Well that's already odds blocking exports, UK bigger shortfall yet want take UK vaccines making shortfall worse. Hardly equal.

And finally, say vaccine nationalism bad. they've thrown first stone. really sure that? guess one really knows exactly.

What read, antingenic drift also happens like influenza virus, differnt ones.

Also, people Sars-Cov-1 imunity sars-cov2?

It really make sense ""an issue weird spot similar significantly different"", alike same, stick original antigenic. get high initial number cases.

yep - [SSI estimates around 3000 cases per day early **all Denmark** given testing capacity now.

3000 cases per day estimated **in Stockholm alone** time. [2.5% incidence early means 55k cases, less 2000 reported. country (the netherlands) roughly 150k people vaccinayed, less 1% population. guys great, worries. fault, said doses. right though, EU blame here. already covid would take vaccine? viruses virus normally give immunity like vaccine often provides better immunity get vaccine. Isn’t Israel considered western context?  unreasonable expect person mask place nobody recommends masks reasons think infected? Biontech* Trolley problem going get awhile EU fucked around played games. many times CDC lied past? give 0.000001% chance UK going let vaccines country; matter EU contract, UK's contract crystal clear. export vaccine made UK UK's order 100% fulfilled. 

The UK authority legal high ground preventing exports absolutely nothing EU it. You’re losing focus. article talks people disabilities, people high risk death great bodily injury virus. AVERAGE 20 30 somethings safe. 35-year-old brain tumor undergoing chemotherapy? 32-year-old heart transplant patient immunosuppressive drugs body doesn’t reject heart? 22-year-old cystic fibrosis? 

Unfortunately, it’s black white. Every individual different. can’t say “20 30 somethings” virtually immune virus plenty 20 30 somethings severe disabilities categorically excluded vaccine schedule. stands, individuals disabilities get vaccine time general government workers accountants do. Let sink in. fair said ""the whole first world"". i'm keyed what's going europe sounds like recovery wil highly uneven. japan also lethargic vaccination. australia NZ fully vaccinated january 2022 (but fine cause need it) Genuine question, crude death rate really gone expected amount extra deaths Coronavirus? UK many unfortunate deaths, crude death rate went less previous years? trying understand it.  went wrong Canada? preorder vaccines? think Germany spreading disinformation vaccine

They may referring certain papers decided run claim 8% effective 65s that's fact, even confidence interval huge number could almost anything. fact interval huge, paper could claimed vaccine actually promotes new infections 65s would equally valid.

As rest comment, makes sense. september Nice click bait mate. Take virus fuck right off. What? No. Sweden 10 million people, currently ranks 19th 48 countries terms deaths per capita Europe (with populous nations ahead, excluding Germany). Sweden well throughout pandemic, said many countries used different strategies. Thats it! unfollowing bludgers!

I'm sorry connected reality. current trajectory holds, able reopen New York City dining 25% capacity Valentine's Day think better news either variant spreading community, here. 

The UK variant much contagious easily spread, possibly leads serious infections (because viral load transmission higher), likely leads hospitalizations deaths. upside vaccines effective UK variant South African variant, efficacy monoclonal antibodies less reduced UK variant South African variant.

The South African variant set problems. shown re-infect already COVID. Vaccines less effective UK variant. ""knocks out"" monoclonal antibody treatments, meaning essentially useless. upside proven, juncture, South African variant leads serious deadly outcomes, transmissible reason re-infect recovered patient. 

In perfect world, neither variant would spreading community, here. much imperfect world, variants foreseeable future. likely experience pain UK variant first, however, dominant strain U.S. March (higher R0 even lockdowns social distancing place, hospitalizations, deaths). pain South African variant could bad, possibly worse, unless vaccinate many people possible shortest amount time develop booster shots similarly delivered entire population protect us it.

Osterholm would claim god capable knowing future holds. I’ve wondering lately curious know redditors thoughts. think high percentage people become recluses result pandemic, despite vaccinated? family members obsessed COVID point unhealthy genuinely worry never travel/go restaurants/etc ever again.

Honestly think going well. home state Virginia among worst country jealous states. vaccinating 1% population every 3 days.

Polls show 60% adults interested taking it. 120 million people. We're 27.5 million 23%. track significant vaccinations within month. Weird, I'm getting shot #1 tomorrow told hope phase 3 data March sometime. Seemed like aggressive timeline sounds like likely although June seems like pretty long time Thank Joe Biden. taking seriously putting plan together. 💵 miss conventions already facing another summer misery. either that, Lula getting scott-free corruption conviction, thus confirming ex-presidents immune law.

Bolsonaro also lucky survived assassination attempt rally, boasted already staggering support.

Few elections history wild last one Brazil. Doctors phase one health care workers. getting vaccines now. get second moderna shot week. Retail workers phase 1b according cdc. listed 1b well. seems things changed bit system best tell. Yet CDC prioritize groups focused on. apparently special. Jokes yall social begin w! Actually one bestie remained close, family actually talk still there. lonely, mom grandma died 2020, things lot silent feel. probably statistically, what's particular rush? I’m starting trial southern Indiana tomorrow, it’s getting there.  goes show uniform rollout fact dispaities planning execution mean take much longer everybody else. Also, California, priority disabled/high risk outside 65+ demographic completely removed. shit show. People going hog wild trips bye bye fuck forever Zoom parties plus masks burning. Well sucks, know vaccinable. real way out. 4 weeks much. Kiss ass. Thanks, really shit show. 

In past week President said everyone wants vaccine one spring, CDC said know many vaccines sent where, state we've temporarily shut two vaccination sites vaccine shortfalls.

There lack consistent messaging started previous administration really needs cleaned quickly current. anyone else concerned fertility? 

I’m really, really, REALLY concerned. dealing fertility issues moment requiring surgery, there’s data vaccines effects pregnant women women trying get pregnant, I’m scared mind it.

I feel like I’m going forced take it, anything takes away fertility chances I’m going devastated. 

Is anyone else dealing anxiety? cancel postpone... come That's nice, thankfully crazy person internet absolutely fucking idea they're talking about. 4 weeks hard lockdown would basically nothing point, virus way widespread Exactly. I’ve always felt (even 8 months ago) crappy masks better masks. Anything lessen viral load inhaled helps. would imagine somehow inhaled extremely small amount virus, might function similar vaccine itself. Dr though. one likes attending weddings. friends family music industry difficulty paying bills according know find something else now. ivory tower say. 

Attending concert everyone wearing masks takes part enjoyment away. anywhere Canada. -90C fucking cold. know It’s understood quite time individuals certain underlying conditions greater risk severe illness death

80-90% illnesses fatalities occur people aged 65+ serious health conditions *that already contracting covid*.

You two 65 year old people, one good health another 2 serious health conditions. chance illness and/or fatality different two factor 100 1000 based health conditions. answer simple travel pandemic. Kinky... Something important remember receive Pfizer Moderna vaccine getting infected anything. risk viral infection vaccine itself. persons immune system reacts foreign material vaccine main determining factor symptoms person have. 

Let clear, immune system cells cause symptoms. That's it. 95% likely immune 2 shots. hope so. grocery store worker got covid work would much rather take vaccine get covid again.

US biotech saves day! Especially short 500k died recently. much winning Hell yeah we're crushing it!! seen numbers?? countries rookie numbers. We're elite. USA.. USA.. USA!! People think epidemiologists gods capable telling future agree other. People need stop freaking epidemiologists sharing opinions.

you proved point pisses people trying demonize teachers wanting class without vaccine them! don’t families loved ones take care home. what’s worse teachers desperate see kids classroom shouldn’t sacrifice health families health it. Czech, long agony never ending restrictions basically waiting nothing almost makes wishing gov would smack board say ""OK thats it, 4 weeks hard lockdown"". would mean least something.

Right just... actually life sucking. Waiting... waiting... British strain knocking door. numbers really dropping... waiting again. Almost year nonstop home office. Thats mentally devastating. relaxation question. vaccine? Yeah sure. summer. Maybe. young healthy gonna punished that. really, really hope normalize mask-wearing coming this! I've heard conversations among medical professionals places might start patients matter course even pandemic places makes sense (like... cancer centers, earlier post) love idea.

I think people still wear certain places, might get ""early adopters"" also wear public like Asia feeling ill go out. Would love see cultural change way time! Pretty sure #1 thanks trump Correct, we’ve info awhile now. Seems reasonable long filter lazy bum teacher talking points. Ain't one got put community's health risk can't take familial responsibility kid. think postponed 2022. Olympics social distancing depressing. Right now, high rate infection US, welcome countries like Canada EU. bot? different vaccine study 4k people 1 *placebo* group severe infection. see confidence interval? exactly rock solid data.

Don't get wrong, variants concerning. right transmission rate seems concerning. fact clue indicating could approaching variants bypass immunity much significant degree

But let's also forget antibodies part picture. Serological studies found evolve broad response time B cells likely respond reduce severity. even seen data yet cell responses. possible variants mild upon reinfection may eventually see new strain changes It’s woefully insufficient. Flights tourism stopped. making stuff up. can't say herd immunity percentage 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% weeks apart numbers correct. Unlikely. Totally agree there. bad Fauci.

Within year they'll vaccinated, they'll come pandemic close time everyone else hardly total lockdown time spread virus. They've got wins virus pretty much way slice it, yeah I'd say crushed appropriate word. new poll came said 70% would take vaccine upped number 80%, 90%.

No, said 70-90%.

[X] import virus &lt;- VOTE 24! Maybe question commonly asked, worried vaccines selecting virulent strains? Lol!...every 30 minutes!...  get one sweet sweet vaccines? yearly booster thing always journalists totally misunderstanding scientific papers saying. See this:  agree. trials America cherrypicked healthy population, novavax SA trial huge number HIV kneecapped immune response. EU asking countrys (UK particularly, still primarly 70 up) give theirs, EU give 65s.

Sounds lot fairer EU give 65s elsewhere get vaccinated quicker.

 Everywhere 65s vaccinated looking potencial 90%+ decrease mortality. 65s? Less 8% reduction, 45s? Less 1%. UK gets 65 done, even case rates remained crazy reason, looking 80 deaths day, 1000, 45s up? 10 day. Conversely Germany giving 65s? change 1000 900 dead per day.

EU one started fairness talk queue jump (using really twisted logic) fairness want getting AZ everyone else wants covers 65s what's really **fair**. multiple cases South Carolina SA strain now. 

So yeah, spreading. Well said!!!! giving AZ risk, means logically fairly go country's are. 

The AZ doses go medical care workers high priority groups 65 like people heart problems. understand, still get infected, still spread it, still contribute people getting sick dying even vaccine.

You don’t paranoid, still take precautions. read contract? Could share please 60%, according criticizing Trump thing.  Super big yikes Special education going back tuesday escondido. I’m saying may spike outside LA also could better (or worse) there’s genuine weirdness confidence intervals. I'm scared SA variant COVID-19 become dominant United States.

You really think going better SA variant wild? know, personally position differs public health experts one, believe open debate even scientific grounds, least far going along guidance many states / national dialogue. They're bots trying make reality Biden could magically end pandemic seem real piss people off. warning Los Angeles County. absolutely normalized.

If person feeling sick wear mask go out.

I'll wearing one cold flu season sure. respectful. everyone to, think seeing much common thing. Southeast asia long time, I've always thought too. New research suggests [**over-the-counter nasal spray significantly reducing nearly eliminating SARS-CoV-2, virus causes COVID-19 single dose. 

Sorry, ""after single dose"", screams sensationalism me. also applied FDA approve &amp; hear crickets. 

I'm saying able try anything &amp; everything want help avoid covid, seems me. lot friends dont really text much kind relied hanging person, virus kind damaged friendships. I’m pretty sure I’ve seen comments sub people expecting everyone vaccinated beginning April. People celebrating effectiveness current version vaccines day today experiments done *in vitro.* Studies *in vivo* (like one) much meaningful. join celebration think celebration stage bit premature. similar IM oil bruising something awful. Dude, think big part issue cloth mask standardized. may better disposable masks, may much worse. people may keep wearing far longer instead replacing mask, leading mask becoming less effective fabric thins out. people might keep mask clean, leading buildup mold spores inhale without realizing.

cloth masks clearly work quite effective ideal scenario. even effective n95 type masks, neither surgical style masks. issue people buying masks etsy produced testing manufacturing standard decide that's adequate x situation one actually know.

there also speculation new variants might need n95 fda certified kn95 quality masks, there's talk too. hope vaccines make difference US variant take over, imo prudent get type mask one can. South african brazilian variants enter chat state in?

You'll probably want keep hush-hush little 👀 people experience mild symptoms.

Personally, unfit man fifties, I'd expect bed-ridden I'll take long-COVID death day! One thing surprises number people (even sub) say they're done masks second vaccines make dent effectively become anti-maskers later year.

I *like* wearing mask, grand order things, put ""trivial inconvenience"" bucket. live Canada also particularly *like* suit like Arctic explorer four months year, part routine.

So throw mask going store another year... I'm thoroughly ""whatever"" that. would prefer to, sure, hardly worth time actively pissed it. sad explain justify that. much craziness thought would assume worst. Glad whole family way safe.

I thought supposed hope symptoms? worse body reacts vaccine, prepared body actual covid? Fauci’s definitely good public speaking, competent person incompetent administration.  misread article said macabbi insuranced people non infected people severe symptoms.

it say wether ones sent hospitals severe symptoms not. (not people israeli hospitals severe symptoms, even light symptoms data 16 apperantly) war zone gets kinda normal while.  Got second Moderna dose. Light grade fever chills, body aches. That’s Pretty much ICU threshold then? 

So ICU threshold, need believe government claims indefinite unassailable power

Well word vomiting. post tagged USA, Governor's unassailable power. emergency powers used basically checks them. legislature (CO example) voters (CA 81% overrun ICU

I never said was, given nationwide sitting 79% many areas lower that, 80% (which fess up, misread know it. said ""ICU demand"" instead availability) requirement go restrictions ""absurd"" seeing basically nowhere restrictions. immunity vaccine. less severe case covid taken 2 shots (see Israeli reports 5% get covid vaccinated). hard yourself!!! people scared virus mutating, didnt like hundreds millions people get 1918 flu, never mutated point people lost immunity it, afaik Flu mutates faster covid does.

Pag. 159-161 answers. think best reasonable efforts normally include breaking (earlier) contracts could cover making future contracts using reason. Fair enough, that's choice. I'd rather keep isolating another six months wait better vaccine. Instructions unclear.... suppository? trust J&amp;J especially Baby powder causing cancer lawsuit. I'd rather inject Clorox. tell firsthand people living nursing homes residential care facilities strict quarantines almost year (at least state). clients received first dose Moderna Pfizer, excited DHSS RCFs lesson restrictions.

I'm ""writing off"" people long Covid ""written off"" people long term flu symptoms. actually explains lot. states highest positivity rates counting number tests performed less states.

So someone tested weekly Alabama, count 1 test. states, one person undergoing testing protocols could account 30+ plus tests. positivity rate always higher discounting regular testing well individuals. prevents hispitlisations.

If losses biotech pharma towards UK, UK government basically throw citizens bus. regulations, yeah! means money Lord Moneypenny buddies.

The EU commission signing contract earlier might led vaccine available today. AZ honor current contract, probably would honored hypothetical earlier one.

The commission certainly fucked vaccination acquisitions. responsible AZ breaching contract. would neglect duties anything enforce fulfillment said contract. reality Prime Minister late party.

This totally false. Even Moderna said Canada one first buyers. Yeah. sub lately shown whole time people saying “I’m staying indoors help family” “everyone needs wear mask help everyone else!” actually saying “you fuckers better protect ME!” vaccine “holier-than-thou” attitude turned selfish “I’m vaccinated fuck all!”

Canada one actually setup agreements purchase vaccine. concern building manufacturing capabilities replace conservatives sold years ago better position come next virus scare. assume similar ""severe"" reactions see talked clinical trials. vaccine trials severe reaction shot could red area around injection site larger 3 inches (or something like that). Severe disease may defined like prolonged shortness breath, need hospitalization still considered serious opposed mild. Yeah, weird article. don’t know what’s considered “western” US 7th worldwide cases per capita 11th highest worldwide deaths per capita. don’t anticipate western nation overtaking either metrics.

edit: least that's understanding honestly think lockdowns caused lot trauma general virus ever would have. Oh god gives fuck? trying save lives not? Yes, value 16% entirely meaningless. rate Canada.

To compare rates, work rates individually compare. scale first population, use higher numerator population. missing anything, except apparently dispute nature obligation supply EU agreement - apparently “best efforts” standard something similar, opposed strict obligation provide certain number doses specific time. EU claim AZ obligated supply, AZ disagrees contract there, says initial doses made using EU supply chain.

What Sanofi vaccine? EU sign hundreds millions doses ready months.

Blame EU useless negotiating stance focused price supply chain. Given choice, would definitely get J&amp;J vaccine today, waiting time get Pfizer Moderna, supposed September me. It’s 100% effective hospitalizations destroys main advantage vaccine. LOTS healthcare workers declining vaccine.
Source: healthcare see does/does want vaccine. Thanks, Post Malone! :D Utah vaccinating teachers since New Year, opened teachers k-12 time opened 65+. hope states same, include preschool teachers daycare workers well. Well UK made decision, based upon racism, leave EU upset vaccine going EU instead UK. contract obvious. UK looses racists. getting 0.2% from?  study indicates 14.8% patients still least one symptom 90 days. seems inevitable eventually strains going bypass vaccination immunity. said don’t really know well *deep immunity* work new strains. might better current numbers show won’t really know vaccinated people start running new strains. I’m worried Brazil SA, Brazil probably even so. really need keep fingers crossed boosters keep demand thing evolves over, assuming one-time vaccinations won’t enough time. asked black medical professionals know getting vaccine mentioned Tuskegee Airmen. AZ 62%. tried wearing N95 normal mask top bit harder breathe (a bit) ended taking n95 off. That's first time I've ever used N95. real crank things fast possible. goal stop hospitals overwhelmed, goalposts move eradication herd immunity? Meh! 😕 Guess I'll sticking Pfizer/Moderna. someone could convince Indian government absolute cheapskate get whatever cheapest crappy vaccine.... talking about? would affect friends family still pass them? statement completely contradicts itself. Congrats!! best target get emotions riled up.

I think anybody EU cares. Nobody back home even really knows UK involved this. story framed AZ vs. EU issue. UK framing otherwise. 66%. can't pick number say masks reason result. many factors go it. Anyone want sum me. Who's right terms Q1 deliveries held back. EU right AZ good argument hella annoying Yeah measles one insane. respiratory disease like COVID-19, 95% effective amazing Now? Probably not. time buy 9 months ago. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Personally, I'm concerned South African Brazilian variants. word Brazilian variant (that I've seen yet), Moderna confirmed vaccine less effective South African company also says vaccine used variant initially found South Africa, known B.1.351, vaccine produced levels virus-fighting antibody titers around sixfold less used variants. think read Pfizer little less effective well, mostly focused Moderna vaccine that's received (second dose Monday symptoms outside sore arm injections). I'm definitely going play safe Moderna releases new booster shot working South African variant, know whether effective Brazilian variant. thought Israel like 25% vaccinated weeks ago? Went every single link. Mostly anecdotal. couple studies send based questionnaires? zero medical inspection? Based studies, could considered long Covid cough interviewed 6 months later. incredibly flawed. People (justifiably) given pushing Zoom Zoom calls risked extra loneliness connecting via text/snap (ie direct) people think realized Zoom sucks.

I definitely miss ""stop complaining missing friends, ZOOM them!"" rhetoric saw lot last year. Sweden 3 times deaths Denmark, turn 3 times deaths Norway, per capita

Which would 9 times Norway. misleading, indeed!  Wait till cases drop one per day country fine. get mrna booster new strains available. It’s useless. must misread paper. It’s 85% severe COVID, 100% hospitalizations. Calm down. Okay nearly everyone willing wait years get vaccinated, know sure hell not.

I already covid, likely immune. Gimme shot good measure let go club 🥳 Totally false.

100% hospitalizations variants.

Great shot. know deadly serious, maybe I've reading Neal Stephenson lately, seems like could basis great scifi. got different vaccines--some using completely different technologies--racing mutant strains popping array geographical locations. vaccines effective certain mutations others less. imagine deadliness ramps up, groups form isolate based geographic strengths vaccine vs local virus mutations. Decades centuries pass human race divided Johnsonites, Phizerians, Modernans, etc. think might blown little proportion. honest, given circumstances seems strange policy already effect. way interpret EU wants ensure manufacturers EU exporting vaccines outside bloc whilst failing deliver EU contracts. seems like sensible policy.

Who effect? Maybe UK, Israel, Singapore Canada short term Pfizer said production Belgium plant high enough meet obligations end Q1. Assuming satisfy EU order, there's reason vaccines destined countries stopped. wording used EU actually supports manufacturers honouring agreements. another opinion piece. one touts EU using English law. problem arises. so, maybe best solution business contracts future choose use English law. Popped face today. NYT suck shit. France locked down. CDC saying schools open safely. don’t actually know safe schools reopening really since many schools don’t test kids staff. Little testing= little reported cases really makes seems like covid doesn’t spread within schools. truth don’t really know many schools source infections. CDC makes recommendations based upon data receive, schools purposely collecting releasing testing data, it’s hard trust CDC recommendations. Sauce?

That would encouraging. Still really EU's fault AZ messed up. If. least he's peddling snake oil countries use torture population deaths per capita.  85% severe disease 100% hospitalisation. turns lethal illness bad flu. I’d take it. we've got concerning news far - [the EU confirmed export controls threatens global vaccine supply chains (Pfizer's non-US production EU based one) New Zealand little double population queens, NY. It’s great NZ done well, let’s honest, island size could taken leader accomplished thing. According Reuters, they've offered 8 million doses Q1, closer 50% now. Gotta hope find lol protect around unvaccinated?

It 66% effective preventing moderate severe cases. excited this? bad critical pose questions?  Honest question, anyone US call Americans? are, I’m one international 2-dose Phase 3 trial groups got first shot 2 weeks ago became billionaire wearing mom's dress. come work me? 🤷‍♂️ ridiculous. Austria lockdown since beginning November, everything closed apart grocery stores, pharmacies etc. next Monday likely extend end February. cases completely flatlined since Christmas, earlier week poll ""surprisingly"" said amount people think restrictions excessive record high! 

One might think maybe, maybe leads government least opening stores, barbers motivate citizens further, NO! Since Germany scared shitless variants wants harder restrictions entire EU, shoot head well... post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Thanks, that's interesting big price difference EU others. suppose though might partly reflect economies scale production cost, perhaps cheaper produce deliver Europe.  maybe takes account funding given EU.

I imagine end making profit one way another long term; fair enough good job.  wonder though overcommitting much vaccine could deliver, connection securing investment new equipment etc... y’all comprehend plans pandemic include multiple steps doesn’t mean goalposts moved?

No. subreddit purely reactionary. There’s reason common cold vaccine impossible: 
1. causes overwhelmingly mild symptoms worth cost make vaccines
2. caused mostly many different strains rhinoviruses 4 endemic coronaviruses (with SARS CoV 2 likely 5th endemic common cold virus). 

Making vaccine expensive, worth time consuming. Nobody really minds getting cough days maybe headache means live great life.

Flu (every year causes differing levels deaths) concern scientists working universal flu vaccine takes account various antigenic drift shifts create vaccine works flu much longer time current year. may require people 2 shots (or even one!) lifetime protect influenza viruses. Still way mRNA never know might happen! I’m wearing mask outdoors. 

Time spent together key factor spread. 

Passing someone split second sidewalk significant risk. Canada went big Sanofi Novavax vaccines (52 million doses, each). UK puts serious face blocking vaccine export acts offended. nice act expect would work, right? Need demand full open hospitals risk reasonable... Flu isn’t floor, stress flu, stress threaten space running out.

Should happen couple months. Sooner later. matter here, since see people show anyway get COVID vaccine.  idea use ""lick-a-stick"" type tests, 10 minute turnaround. stories company made test, heard anything month. Novavax Thursday released initial results UK trial showing vaccine 89.3% effective preventing COVID-19, nearly effective protecting highly contagious variant coronavirus first discovered UK. also protected potent South Africa variant, though lower rate.  infection means gets body stays bit. disease means causes symptoms. least, that's idea it. way. seems like care all. say lockdown permanent impossible goal eradication achieved people want end will. That's already heading seems. lot uneducated folks Alabama poor leadership. Please educate them....whatever takes. Yeah I’m worried somehow horrible virus mutate harmful young people since older ones safe. India tends type thing.

Indians eat 20% less calories per capita Chinese, equal population, yet food exporter China food importer. Actually 160 million Moderna 500 million Pfizer current numbers. Sanofi failed unless come something else project dead. 💝 travel restrictions. They’ve already fully enrolled two shot trial US. We’ll know around summertime well works. mostly matches immunity successfully recovered COVID patient, 

How reach conclusion? one 66% effective. Reinfection someone got sick astronomically small. J&amp;J anywhere close recovered patient far understand. Twin Cities metro resident contracted virus Brazil fell ill upon returning home. person diagnosed Jan. 9. movements diagnosis unknown.  health officials said there indication Brazil P.1 variant isn’t widely circulating. also said current COVID-19 vaccines still work it. 49-day thing caught eye too.

I'm guessing US? Because, ya know, ""plan"" kinda we've spent ten months hoping for. weird friends 33% chance get it, side effects vaccines people I've known actual coronavirus; Coronavirus myself, better wear friend got Pfizer vaccine, think I'll skip both. leaders begun realize can't much longer. Europe seem care., announce permanent lockdown say end want too. Stay Home order CA worked, except staying home part ;) Send vaccines, too! :) eye remember news websites halted putting paywall covid news, like New York Times. Dont think WP did. think even used reason buy. Pretty shitty total solution, still good tool arsenal. Wow congratulations, especially poll numbers. would like see numbers country. People used anti-science many anti-vaxxers. That’s definitely true.....fake news. What's difference infection disease mechanism wise? live ""poorly run democratic city""

There's massive underground parties happening last 3 months anyone know goes got COVID summer one know traced outbreak. 

Any outings ive attended worn mask however worked nightclub february shutdowns mass testings described stubborn cold specifically fucked lungs.

Worked 2 whole weeks like ""we 10 cases US"" time well may patient zero initial outbreak. (/s course, wildly control time got sick)

But now? almost feels like everything back normal. Friends family members passed away. Pretty much everyone know gotten it. numbers decreasing, imo, looks like herd immunity. Anyone know used go out, still do. bars arent advertising promoters arent posting it, happens. 

My fear never .001% death rate whatever deniers said, fear every single person earth either need vaccinate fight it. people talking updated herd immunity models take account heterogenous spreading high numbers unconfirmed Covid cases. herd immunity, although change quickly start wild crazy orgies celebrate.  ""I found I've vaccinated COVID since September last year,"" Pfizer Moderna cut shipments Canada, EU saying they'll block exports countries - still think September timeline hold?

I bridge Alaska I'd like sell you... Hmm let’s see comes light next days Pfizer currently 12+ study. that's done believe 9+ next. Maybe older people likely flu vaccine less reactions younger people don’t get flu vaccine? Better handling immune response?  tunnel vision europeans leaders astonishing, cities like Barcelona, Rome Athens depend tourism leaders just. crushing cities. fear going use variants prevent happening states -- even absence severe disease.  *conditional* herd immunity, dependent measures place need 75% infected. 

I addition, naturally induced herd immunity infect people random; instead, groups driving epidemic, many social contacts, tend become infected first, immune epidemic loses steam, without needing infect many would needed random vaccination program. thought interesting information given already seeing pretty substantial lessening cases US even though even ~2% population 1 dose like 2 weeks back.

I would attribute to: Thanksgiving/Christmas/New Years anymore. Yeah export vaccines even Canada get europe. one way seem right. mean, vaccines work work. COVID numbers determine safety precautions necessary point won’t reasonable require masks shut businesses. reason worry existing variants start seeing massive increase rate reinfections. We're seeing anywhere knowledge. One shot great asking official peer-reviewed data fair. I'd like too. 

First, wanna say I'm huge fan AstraZeneca's vaccine. love tech, love mission has, love low price fact allowing mass production countries. also growing sympathetic UK's role leader fighting pandemic. 

Now, understanding full data released ""The Lancet"" literally day now. review process take long time sometimes. could also took Gamaleya long time submit data. 

I question too. official peer-reviewed data AstraZeneca's vaccine? ""only"" able find phase II data publication ""The Lancet"". saying published it, able find publication. it, could please link here? give link that? far EU approved measure ensure vaccine producers stay loyal contracts, thorough inspections plants investigate malice play not. Tyler Perry black people. many people would better honest. imagine last influential African American used promote vaccine safety. Good, I'm glad finally hear good news. don’t want live world like this. feel completely trapped even public people fearful others can’t especially living free happy life 32 years. exhausting considering every move, exhausting constantly thinking anything related covid can’t much longer. feel you. don’t want live sterile dystopia. director Centers Disease Control Prevention said Friday South African Covid-19 variant, detected two people South Carolina, already reached point community spread U.S. 

Pretty sure right, according experts, UK variant likely become dominant strain months. I’m 36 many. I’m sorry don’t enjoy them. It’s usually reunion fraternity, gathering family. next one wife’s brother it’s kind important literally made claim France figured things bad early on... leaving earlier actually meant less 2 months ago... lol ok There’s even trial kids, no. don’t mean teens, mean like baby -12 years USA well way didn’t proactively screen - probably yes based probability one 40,000 people previously Covid. happens R drops 0.75. takes small difference behavior herd immunity R drop 1.0 better value. 

Covid actually quite easy defeat actually try. Thanks link. Good see models match intuition. know Newsom even Breed opened stuff week (the latter surprised since apparently SF public health didn’t recommend it)? clearly want get back normal. depends people demand, think people like going feel lot better loved ones vaccinated, effect clearly shows. No. idea old many weddings attended opinion, weddings waste money attendees stress going. Affording gift/suit rental/bridesmaid dress stressful. Plus, moochers go free food drinks. believe guests go save face. opinion. need take personally. wanted find proof, successful We'll keep sending them, greetings Netherlands :) haven’t qualified yet. regardless don’t need money. 

This deadliest year 100 years America, yes agree economy equation. agree, pressing concern right now. 

Your last point ridiculous. Every time business gets handout buy dividends, give raises nothing ever comes chute workers. Well imagine tested large chunk students used sample identify outbreaks. Knowledge would cheap powerful. Given much economic damage whole thing done, there’s pretty much reasonable arguments many rapid tests every context time. Well, yes, completely agree that, mean current climate partisan - said. vaccine turns mild covid case heart damage covid, someone else's death mild covid case heart damage, come ahead, even though ReDuCe nUmBeR mIlD cAsEs. Ok? what, supposed conform others feel bad embarrassed?

WTF? keep wearing mask impossible CHECK VACCINATED TIMES FUCKS SAKE! Got mine today!!! (Virginia USA) already bought EU plants. contract UK. Get help man jesus  that’s want get back to?? everyone wants locked house forever. us enjoy human interaction. mean without success?

I gut feeling AZ sending Eu doses UK theory much supported academic literature along empirical results. agree importance reducing strain hospitals mortality rate, there's much evidence points even mild cases causing lingering symptoms possibly even organ damage.

The vaccine could reduce mild cases asymptomatic cases, severe cases mild cases. Authoritarian leaders US wanna throw ring Mount Doom. research hasn’t done transmissibility. don’t know, vaccines, transmit.

Some vaccines stop transmission slow it. don’t. Nobody knows right now. ...i hope joking. can't stupid literally approved today South Korea talks too: bad news never stops  True, looking reduced spread truly asymptomatic people, incredibly low reinfection rate, find reasonable determine spread well short order. definitely things I've gotten used probably continue save money, like shaving head instead spending $30 barbershop every week, using home gym instead paying membership, making coffee every morning instead buying way work.

I actually thought going movies celebrate getting vaccinated miss popcorn, there's jack shit playing theaters that's out.

I very, much miss going restaurants bars friends rather cooking home, though. Small luxury, cooking 1 depressing fuck. Double-masking ridiculous idea. already hard enough breathe one mask, breathing would restricted might breathe carbon dioxide more. Yooo would sucked. think cats breath smells like cat food Sweden fine, look Unless specified contracts, order signed matter legally. fairest solution would probably split existing supply, even exactly ideal. Also need remember flu take high. CDC says 49% got flu shot. Covid vaccine coverage likely alot higher like 70-80%. combine vaccinated pfizer/moderna others J&amp;J Novavax etc. help.

End day we're really lucky several effective vaccines one year covid. Oh, turntables I’m virtual since last March think reddit needs kind warning whenever Bolsonaro quoted - lie right simply repeat lies without type warning. ok headline 100% false? Blocking Pfizer vaccine coming UK would unbelievably damaging UK. people still need second dose.

A vaccine war would damage us all. thats case AZ clearly lying EU, said contract UK impact EU deliveries J&amp;J released exact wording. fucking misleading. Can't wait hear complain LOL need know many vaccinated still got infected. number useful reflect effectiveness God knows 66% from. would hardly call Tegnells methods scientific unless wanna Pandemic research live population! Um didn’t. guess capable pulling off, people definitely put harm's way behalf.

Nobody's risking life skippy. one disagreeing friend seniors getting vaccinated one arguing shouldn’t, read article issue state changing priority 65+ group next line originally essential workers, immunocompromised folks regardless age, work vital sectors public facing etc even included 50+, basically decide inoculate 50+ leaving others serious health conditions work congregate settings easily spread. Excellent vaccines exist. need them.

""Nah, selection vaccines, need order mRNA vaccines"" -Ursula Witch need reassured shit long people getting vaccine wealthy, celebrities, elderly. Months ago hoping vaccine would 70% effective. Moderna Pfizer ended blowing expectations water people want single dose vaccine 95% effective, too. would miracle dream, it’s realistic. got spoiled. Taking first shot today! Non-alcohol related. Yes, understand concern I'm favour vaccine nationalism. think rate negotiated across board supplies distributed evenly based population needs unless risk factor needs tackled.

Unfortunately that's case EU move late this.

I'm UK, I'm way support Boris actions. hold responsible many challenges have. simply commenting see unfortunately goes route see posturing.

EU centrist/centre left parties (according Lisa Nandy MP) said happy Corbyn get in, complain consequences nationalist wins... 4 EU 2 UK believe supposed go arm. cool. we're learning even minor symptom cases lead severe lung scarring long-term side effects though def wont getting one help it. 'dose' 'vaccine' defined terms contract? seems strange be. Well hope proves out.  partially agree you. Support small businesses keep people employed, support lost jobs. $2000 everyone strange IMO, especially much money gets spent sites like Amazon, put crypto/stocks. stimulating economy? spent locally, hardly going help struggling businesses ones benefiting government aid. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Agree totally amplifying interacting everyone sees this! real things.

Some amount people catch spread covid super bowl parties. amount people die. 

That nothing. autopsies trial population delayed much success finding country without murder laws.  Wrong. single dose mrna vaccine also terrible variants. j&amp;j vaccine get boost preclinical data proves 60% populations HIV widely spread, meaning 60% countries comes SA strain. I’m concerned fact still get ill, meaning higher transmission probability meaning mutations happen. one putting another mask make much sense anyway unless high risk place. making positive use privilege. sounds like net positive country. press release? slides like Novavax provided last night?

Never mind. First paragraph - ""These results submitted medRxiv due published online imminently."" That’s lousy number, I’m sure vaccine makers infectious disease experts know it.

No reasonable person settle 57% something like covid. long term, better available. Covid like polio, flu. 

It make take years, don’t think us need settle low efficacy vaccine.   Moderna Pfizer peak antibodies? probably bit both. think tools right (the ones I've seen) garbage.  waste manufacturing power worse vaccines better ones - Pfizer, Moderna one revealed yesterday, novasomething. guess B.117 hit yet guys... believe mountain valleys hit Austria infection rates scary shit. ramped mandatory FFP2 it. Fuck her! always easy blame someone else. SHOOT ALREADY EU stop exports adjuvants needed AstraZenecas vaccine. Gets worse see even redact bookmarks lots redacted info figures.

http://prntscr.com/xtdqt7 single best vaccine far, every metric...  Right, always give Pfizer/Moderna booster road people receive vaccine things control stock higher? Keep mind single dose trial. Combined moderna mrna vaccine boost likely lead much better efficacy tried.   Believe know we’re concerned it. try fix situation won’t change overnight. Agreed. able jump line. shortage vaccines. people want can’t even get it. still plenty people actually want vaccine. don’t need celebrities getting skip line prove skeptics safe vaccine wildly available. take UK contract account. UK contract says first 100 million doses produced UK factories go UK, will, can't deliver UK. Thank fuck. I’m tired people escaping US month weather coming back following pre existing measures Better late never. Thankfully tories didnt listen starmer wanted us join EU calamity point everyone keeps vaccines UK fine. EU not. movies corny self aware enough make corniness fun seems stand guy kind person leads example. know it’s selfish hope supply becomes available you’ll allowed choose one get, I’d rather get two dose honestly. I’ll trade get second shot protection. know fact? mean Chronic Fatigue Syndrome also known ""post viral syndrome"". restrictions march pretty successful came summer 600 death compared sweden 5000, unfortunately main health experts huge fan Tegnell followed route autumn. Result, standing 7000 deaths went lockdown end november sustainable anymore.

You imagine pretty pissed Tegnell exporting fuckup still insisting right way! understanding correctly? think chronological order. Please let know I'm wrong.

1. UK signs contract AZ number vaccines.

2. EU same. 

3. AZ manufacturing difficulties EU.

4. EU demands second-in-time contract honored prioritized, AZ break contract UK. 

What missing? understand lives line, seem hold objective logical perspective. Honest question here. airborne rabies shows up, rest assured I'll use one those. virus? No.  Actually 85% protection 'severe Covid' 100% protection dying Covid much worse AstraZenica vaccin.

It sounds worse AZ 70%. J&amp;J worst results vaccines far. posted article predicting wouldn’t approve 65. Nice wrong. UK embarrassed respect confidentiality business, EU going see loss pharmaceutical biotechnology sectors speed up. 

They delayed signing contract 3 months, start new job know much paid duties are? delay whilst negotiated price (on cost vaccine), way seems got cheaper price moving partner production less experienced cheaper facilities, originally agreed. get shocked amazing output.

The EU commission going responsible additional deaths 10,000s save € sit applaud them? appears travellers expense, like Australia 62% actually. U.K. paid factory supply chain, EU paid far less, much later. 

I don’t think demand goods factory paid privately, see. think might wake call EU can’t demand things non-EU countries.

I think asked nicely paid extra. threatened U.K., Canada Isreal. sub ranting ""population"" (aka herd immunity) impossible entirety last year? Took time. Thank goodness United Kingdom part EU. Yeah, take flu shot too. I’m pickier covid vaccine virus isn’t like flu. genetic risk that’s isn’t well understood yet. I’d like see excellent vaccines everyone, available. Palm Beach County America's famous orange mask refuser lives? geographically New Zealand might different category, think politically/historically aligned “west” they’ve put everyone shame. AstraZeneca uses adjuvants made EU.

EU force production UK stop. approach ensures EU waste money vaccines demonstarted results. However, put back line. UK ordered doses long time ago, took risk, entitled first 60 million doses Novavax vaccine. EU even signed contract Novavax vaccine yet... Matter perspective guess. Life pointless covid pointless after. 

Some people wired different really need social interaction get that. glad me. 

The good news end closer think US. We'll 100 million vaccinated couple months grow there. smart, right, literally anything I’ve read. Enjoy ignorant life! barrage articles bashing US reddit you? truth? Moderate COVID-19 disease defined laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 one following: evidence pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis, shortness breath abnormal blood oxygen saturation 93%, abnormal respiratory rate (≥20); two systemic symptoms suggestive COVID-19. Well J&amp;J available public, surely tell single dose rather 2. Nope, I'm stable enough place life right now. matter. J&amp;J vaccine sucks variants. Double dose change that.

Fuck EU buying Moderna Pfizer. We'll get vaccinated even help. need 80% herd immunity trash vaccine get us even absolutely everyone gets it. Considering they've shown effective elderly well highly doubt put formal age restriction especially supplies limited need much doses get right regardless vaccine. Although practice may reserve say moderna/pfizer elderly providing specific vaccine centre enough supply pick choose. may vaccine centres give much pfizer/moderna elderly move onto J&amp;J/AZ elderly enough modenra/pfizer. pure speculation. 85% severe disease 100% hospitalization? 🥸🦧 goal damaging UK 🤷🏼‍♂️ age what? going cons? Saints fan, think Drew (before body broke past couple years) much closer Pfizer/Moderna. Put someone like Matt Stafford J&amp;J spot. Could worse! Pfizer one 100% effective? - Oxford one would even less effective comparison. difference mainly come government reacted covid.

November 1st Sweden **4.8x** deaths per capita compared Denmark

That difference currently **3.2x**, that's Denmark schools closed retail closed since beginning December. new York new Amsterdam old pharma-greed bubbling surface. *looks map*

You seem pretty fuckin far East loses 1/2 antibodies compared modernas 1/6. Pfizer's much stronger new strain compared moderna's? B117 variant *might* *project* R 1 even measures currently Europe, sets assumptions.

It’s like game telephone every step removed actual expert, people become certain conclusion says news release vaccine slightly less effective new variant coronavirus that's circulating U.K. — 86%. original COVID-19 strain, vaccine 96% effective, company says.

Good news though tackling UK variant! Olympics go ahead. EURO 2020 too. ranks New Zealand Covid-19 response best, Brazil worst, US bottom five still cant compare israel countries.. israel small country.. Yes, contained accordingly Double ? Ha make laugh, regular ones leak like titanic. 


Want improve masks ? Find leak air sides start with. Right? I've seen bipartisan dunking hedge fund managers threats hearings/regulation. seen come defense. percentage in-person population school caught covid simply don’t know vaccine doesn’t also prevent transmission virus. Chances - vaccines do, virus simply doesn’t enough time get established start shedding. don’t data prove yet, that’s caution advised, people assume still transmit it. called survivorship bias Aye. strain detected Minnesota already though? could Desant..

Oops, wrong state. ""I like results research, research must bullshit.""

You're alone: many children think like that, too. America's first anymore??/s — Social media influencers reality TV stars left Britain sun-soaked destinations citing work purposes slammed government, fans, maintaining opulent presences social media home remain subject third nationwide lockdown coronavirus crisis rages become one top attractions seemingly seeking dodge Britain’s stay-at-home measures, celebrities flocking city United Arab Emirates pose poolside. Many stars documented trips detail, drawing widespread argued trips genuinely necessary business reasons, many appear exploited business loophole, millions people confined houses separated loved ones. Britain recorded 100,000 coronavirus deaths. recent days, British government vowed clamp attempting embark nonessential influencer go Dubai take photos claim it’s work,” wrote one user Instagram. Many others declared unfollowing celebrities posting travel photos. binding orders contract crystal clear,"" Ms von der Leyen told Deutschlandfunk radio, adding contained clear delivery amounts December first three quarters 2021.  also explicitly assured us contract obligations would prevent contract fulfilled,"" added.  von der Leyen said ""best-effort"" cause valid long clear whether AstraZeneca could develop vaccine. also said ""order sequencing"" stipulation mentioned four production sites, two Britain.

Looks like contract going public today, sides certain they're right. There’s huge difference “these factors put us risk future surge” “these factors going cause another surge.”

Experts say former. Regular people prefer say latter, reason polyethylene glycol

She's allergic lot including penicillin well that's trips doctors years.  I'd also like point multiple experts saying AZ may need regotionate send vaccines EU UK Dutch newssource (NOS) saying 2 dose vaccine mate. 

Did want borrow calculator? actually Brazil probably worst response pandemic large nation wouldn’t worry much  Australia limited population, small.

And US could done better regards travel kinds, admin want take action. shit. Read books. Play guitar. Oil pastels. Listen blues. Work job. anyone taken second dose yet? 

I’m scheduled take mine Monday, however, I’ve heard second shot really kicks ass. Wow, sold office?!? must’ve shock delivered news 😅 No. vaccinate enough people we'll never reach ""normal"" again.

They say virus mutation rate increasing. would awful COVID would become endemic require booster shot every year like flu. honestly seems like distinct possibility. articles compare status quo trying succeeding, trying failing. Imagine hard lockdown able get zero matter what. gone pain hard lockdown huge COVID wave anyway.

It's like New Zealand longest hardest lockdown world. lockdown could get zero advantages. Even *with* Australia's advantages, Victoria lock 100 days get zero. would translate another country? 

The idea cost trying failing might high least addressed, never is. I'd rather current status quo try fail get zero. Public health experts running credibility. People going continue blindly listen ""recommendations"". Enough enough.    unpopular opinion sub though. Ahhh, I'm getting first shot tomorrow... I'm excited nervous potential side effects! pro-vaccine also cautious over-hyping efficacy claims proof know adoption rate is. aren’t contradictory viewpoints.

Science isn’t marketing. It’s science. Astra Zeneca still getting bad results: guess look like ""gotcha"" question based previous interactions, I'm actually genuinely curious -- would make difference doctor hand? (there was, based article) sorry, boomer you. got shit  anyone read lol? say, Canada vaccinated 35,000 people far proud AZ doses go medical care workers high priority groups 65 like people heart problems.

That's lot less 80 90 million doses demanding March. would line 40 50 promising though.

The real issue really Pfizer/BioNTech, company actually making profits **delivering first highest bidders** cannot keeps commitments EU (but getting paid more...) latter two German, attack British/Swedish firm instead, **whos vaccine EU even approved yet**, selling cost, first come first served basis. next EU, demand AZ use production India EU?


Simple fact EU screwed pooch big time, took long commit ordering vaccines, expected many come market approved quickly thus spread orders thinly. [Even BioNTech critizing surprised see follow [Hungrys lead bypass 1. Better COVID.
2. It’s couple years.
3. grizzled hell. another year isolation. Maybe slightly later, much. There's supposed 400m doses delivered end June. 255M adults 75M children us. end June would see around 70% adults fully vaccinated, 55% total population. quite herd immunity, enough things could probably go back mostly normal.  


Johnson Johnson supposed ship 100m (single-dose) vaccines end June. vaccine proves effective, could push timeline much sooner. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think hope warranted, would also caution amount skepticism. Moderna Pfizer need start shipping twice much vaccine currently order meet delivery targets. J&amp;J vaccine slam dunk. unlikely everything go exactly according plan. Even given that, think we're looking beginning end pandemic US. Yup! Especially live US; enough people cease compliance simultaneously, restrictions virtually impossible enforce. also benefit *not* totalitarian dictatorship, president eager get country back normal lives. Simple, really. “But, muh Fear Mongering!” strains similar enough still covid-19 

I would surprised show Nailed it. Looks like need wear masks least 2 years minimum. Looks like people underestimating virus deadly consequences.  Yes Different source story (this one behind sure feels like we're back line delays happening. least EU think twice making another contract AZ. nations might too. Hey! I’m member trial! Great news! Um Australia entered chat Forty-eight million doses distributed seem like much. questioned 200 million doses ordered week, top 400 million originally ordered, enough got criticized.

Now hear surplus along thirteen states even used half doses. still better nothing. Maybe company gets vaccinated sooner, able return.

I even option. Turns sold office everyone WFH. UK considered western nation more?  feel way one friend mine. still calls every month catch up, really good friend pre Rona, hard get selfishness actions rn. think people comprehend devastating impact virus could many people, see limited perspective less 1% chance dying think weird germophobic care that. We’re #1! Finally, US #1 right side equation. much military precision. Kinda...the antibodies infection bind tightest vaccine antigens ""win"". Thanks! feel unsafe, maybe quite job? People exhausted restrictions vaccines solution. ""courtesy"" get vaccine. Enough enough already. going see massive shift people's attitudes get vaccine. feel good portion blame lies upon individual.
Individuals refuse wear masks wear properly, people know social distance means, people can't without indoor dining... list goes on.
Reliance science leaders alone, going effective method. individuals, need continue make sacrifices. Yep. sucks, getting sick getting someone care sick. 
Again yeah frustrated long pandemic going on, people give up, longer take. Hang what's right loved ones. Ok...but Canada stop claiming victory war 1812. Savvy? isn’t healthy Honestly, I'm probably going wear kn95 public transportation future. get sick, get really sick long time; matter cold flu whatever. hope pandemic teaches us disease stopping spread even colds. 600K deaths. Sure! many. Maybe vocal minority Legit ashamed living occurs that's happen. simply sustainable. living. supposed never find boyfriend alone virtual dates relationships go sleep lonely every night longing comfort government says no? Screw that. Wow literally would taken less effort check article type lmao smooth won’t another year this. stop complying. move Florida something. imagine AstraZeneca 60% less SA strain.  think mean 'Antibodies'..... state in? Make burner email account report local department health. am, required workplace safety protocols work would massive trouble.

For yourself, get N95 KN95 wear cotton mask top give additional protection. Stay away others. Ask put mask need approach them. won't, refuse get close. live Missouri, there's higher odds people thinking hoax actually concerned it. I've wearing KF94s reason.  hate complain work I’m lucky work home, learned recently won’t let back office later summer/early fall.

On one hand I’m disappointed I’m tired home day none normal... hand, I’m lucky employer taking COVID seriously keep us safe.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* third secure contracts. We’re facing similar supply issues EU way logistical challenges. doesn’t fall one person. It’s massive world wide undertaking take time. don’t produce approved vaccines ourselves. due Harper era cutbacks main reason mercy suppliers US able get many. Pfizer 2 plants working currently one Michigan supplies US 1 Belgium supplies every country world. See issue ?  someone UK, I'm also sorry petty politics could impact country.

We similar position UK regards Pfizer vaccines. got first dose 16th January next appointment due 3rd April. That's 70 days way recommended dose schedule. I'm definitely worried things. people genuinely think it’s likely infect others vaccinated think messaging irresponsible.  Well you’re US there’s whole lot complying little enforcement see point, we're stage people manifesting significant health issues response isolation. us, like you, able better handle it. Others fortunate. 

They may need seek help through, perhaps, qualified counselor, psychologist, medical professional, normal life able resumed -- maybe even transition period may still need help. 

I want diminish anyone's problems. ought supportive unprecedented times. CDC estimate 83MM virus end December. Likely close 100MM now. US administering way tests per capita everyone besides UK   Confirmed cases*. Confirmed cases good metric unless also show testing rates similar. interested deaths per capita instead. Got first days ago zero pain. trying macho anything. I'm glad! guess EU agree notified 60% reduction supply last Friday really constitutes 'best effort'. Personally think fair put blame them. 

In case, keen see much contract released later today. started bring Super Bowl parties super spreader events. course going help cities states allow everything reopen.  Jesus looking Canada envy. talking maybe giving us shot fall ... 

And could crappy one(not impressed AstraZenecca's shot effectiveness). probably get choose. yeah wish could get one mRNA vaccines.  feel you.

I've lucky keep working throughout this, given routine, sometimes absurdity everything happening hits hard...

It makes job sometimes feel like joke. Like this? shit matter. 

I try dwell much.

But yeah... comes goes waves. Well look CDC’s death rate forecast: download excel sheet use forecast option. expected 1M deaths June 30th 1.8M deaths December 31. don’t think it’s implausible. exposed COVID might get British variant occurred still clear, although thought accumulated many mutations gradually. sudden appearance together clue working hypothesis happened chronically infected individual,"" says Gupta. least two cases H69/V70 deletions occurring alongside mutations patients chronically ill Covid-19 – one elderly woman Moscow, Russia, man Cambridge, received treatment cancer thought reduced ability immune systems fight Covid-19. patients infected long, virus time replicate high levels bodies accumulate mutations. patients given antibody therapy, versions virus better able escape outpace treatment survived. Yes, correct. Preventing severe disease death goal here. vaccine reduces severity level common cold, matter people still getting infected. everyone US idiot majority people taken seriously lives negatively impacted sometimes devastatingly so, year, end sight. Anyone wants vaccine, deserves vaccine. Even don’t “deserve” that’s way rest people decent life again. OP understand want see friends face. Many us seen friends faces even heard voices several months. point texting cut want talk someone face face. Zoom anxiety sometimes think hurtful refuse talk someone seen heard months. America FUCK YEAH!
Comin' save motherfuckin' day, yeah
America (FUCK YEAH!)
Vaccinating way, yeah. Covid game through
'Cause answer to

AMERICA FUCK YEAH mask, social distance, isolate another year. It’s bad. 

Toughen folks! gonna long, bumpy ride. 

And bubble dog.  I've felt depressed past five months. actually depressed, feeling disconnected reality, like point anything, finding joy anything. time feel happiness talk online friends, grown less time gone on. Every day thought killing myself. 

I miss human contact. miss people. miss living fucking bedroom. call weak, stupid, priveliged. care. natural easy live way living past year. I’m super good 16 y.o. special needs daughter get vaccinated. point hard take calculated risks. I’m spending summer backyard. Thank recommendation. already see therapist, psychiatrist, take medication, still hard. probably college student hates online courses, feels isolated, unmotivated, dead inside. Even though finishing online, thing keeping going hope end Summer/Fall 2021. I'm NYC. I'm saying reopen completely like lot admin politicians speaking of. currently remote blended stupid shit. Kids come one day week cycle.

We constantly tell students put masks lol.

Unless refuse reminded repercussions. estimate 60% effective South Africa variant, although confidence interval extremely large (it like 10% 90%). sources report 50%, including AIDS patients, would expect vaccine less effective regardless.

Keep mind 60% efficacy targeting originally vaccines. happened lucky get vaccines 95% effective. 60% effective vaccine still enough end pandemic, especially provides 60% protection severe illness. time finding subreddit this

r/medicine discussed experiences couple weeks ago I'm sorry :( Hopefully there's sequel(s) anytime soon Explain EU fucked up?
It negotiated late early, AZ fuck up. soon contract made X promised EU Canada AZ needs oblige that. soon contract made matter one earlier not. contrary, EU trying prevent AZ playing dirty preferring countries paid can't reach delivery goals. think people use 1st World country western country interchangeably, get confused.  Yes. EU bit late. Still EU paid. 

And yes, export ban US UK fair game. export ban EU makes situation fair again. example, Canada buy vaccine US. Israel UK. Nice. Brazil Mexico lower covid testing rates per capita rates India - sure go ahead make assumption suits agenda. Lost reason, Pfizer backs tests did. like someone calls stupid comments get internet. really many people take first thing hear go able adjust behaviour new information comes out? 

Do understand concept credibility quickly reversing course like did, damages credibility? makes look like know talking about.

This usually part people start bleating ""but science changes based new information,"" science anymore. dealing public policy, longer safe assume things work way academic scientific environments. different forces work different considerations need made.

You sit say stupid like, something need work around, going anywhere. Still better Europe especially France Netherlands there's Get tested isolate immediately.  Well 1 doctor died developing ITP 3 days later. Two others recovered. higher rate occurrence MMR vaccine ITP. said may correlation covid rate occurrence extremely low risk death virus likely higher depending age group, certainly something track aware of. That's actual covid experience like minus fever add high resting heart rate. weeks though compared days. Incorrect Novavax uses real-world data rather lab data. Remains seen others hope Israel mass testing planned. Would nice get entire city tested short time span order see many asymptomatic. long N95 mask last? ""stop working""? ok keep using long periods time? 

I box rotate through. go get groceries one day, goes one ""decontamination"" paper bags go masks. start oldest mask again. shelf life? riskier wearing homemade mask nicely fitting? 2022 friend mysterious respiratory infection back March.

Almost exact story. ""You need test definitely it, stay home."" Months later still problems it's, ""sorry, seem positive test soooooo...."" Sweden recommends masks public transport rush hours. EU finished exploratory talks December. Thanks mommy von der Leyen! Pretty sure get Novavax Q4 order now. Pfizer vaccine supposed like 90% effective.

Only 0.4% vaccine receivers far known contracted covid. people probably symptoms, rest probably got tested contact someone tested positive.

It really possible number low unless transmission covid slowed. means vaccine probably actually help lessening/preventing spread covid someone covid despite vaccine. lost whatever reason calling that. There's one thing could call I'd called xenophobic toward continent. I'm kinda confused Israel got eurovision, Australia somehow idk.  feel comfortable sending message, can't promise find immediately, lot Veterans Medical advocacy stuff might able find way. promising I'll certainly give proper attempt! take risks possible side effects vaccine even know long immunity last ...

I vaccinate every 3 months ? No, thanks ...

I still wear mask keep social distance learn virus, make vaccine offer protection least 5-10 years. classrooms kids day, know kids huge germ carriers.

of many diseases. SARS-CoV-2. plenty studies showing this. Stop spreading misinformation. don’t agree me. It’s truth what’s happening. may still wear mask feel like it. don’t feel like it, don’t. don’t know else want say lol direction we’re goin whether like not. Viral Sepsis = Lethal failure vital organ due infection. COVID means organ - heart, lungs, brain, liver, kidneys, etc.

Basically - avoid getting COVID. thing would recommended last February. Meanwhile Canada still getting nothing probably blocked receiving EU export ban.

Canada fucked. say smth best efforts AZ. nationalism. EU first. 

Because EU care EU first. export ban style US/UK proper solution. UK get vaccine EU conditions together EU. never EU. getting incorrect. Here’s ELI5 attempt. order protect someone virus vaccine needs create least set minimum level immune response body exposed virus. vaccines play moment enable body create immune responses minimum level necessary known variants. still prove protection. However actual level response body could many times greater minimum required. response level depends variant. vanilla Covid immune response massive, variants it’s still good needed protection, high. That’s hear things like 40% less effective. relates response level. reduction protection. Doubt it. People aren’t complying medical advice wear mask practice social distancing. think governments across world giving up. Plus new Covid variants South Africa, UK Brazil. Covid going anywhere. It’s going burn way thru world. you’re lucky survive it, complications that’s awesome. left lifetime disabilities. Hopefully vaccines work. Beware ""biostitution"", Carl Hiaasen likes call scientists marketing payroll manufacturers. Reddit popular place advertise, done huge favor. vaccines seem still work pretty well variant, minor reductions efficacy. contractual obligation Oh man got mine yesterday chills fatigue me. happen first time. hey body preparing war. know I'm extrovert.

So, almost one vaccine tests positive, means almost one vaccine contagious.   actions based collective thoughts, one dimensional fear mongering. shit slight zero dipshit slight sure 55% reduction.  still amazes people can't grasp concept.

Exactly, idea cut transmission spread virus. achieve virus host infect able replicate one. vaccine still listed Emergency vaccine prohibits anyone litigation manufacturers someone bad reaction. Work healthcare got first dose Moderna. lot doctors getting sick second dose call 24 hrs. Next week rest employees start getting second doses expecting lot out. Ohio plans vaccinating February mean happen. simply want agree open based something guaranteed, especially since that's first dose. Yep, currently 12 week gaps Pfizer doses UK, trying get many people first dose possible. 

The government said although try make sure people two doses vaccine, people getting second dose different vaccine table. 

If EU blocks supply, could lead less people getting vaccinated, could also mean end medical guinea pigs getting entirely different vaccine.

Add fact EU currently demanding 75M AstraZeneca vaccines UK plants, would hugely impactful vaccine plan. Take consideration 2 million produced week already max capacity. 

That's even taking Canada account, also fucked over. 

It's really shit situation even seriously consider sides argument, EU still comes looking unnecessarily cruel sake politics. don’t even want send kids back school they’ve vaccinated. There’s much don’t know long haul affects kids. that's mister Phil I. Ppines you, peasant understand hate towards EU here. 

It could EU tried demand another regions production AstraZeneca vaccine, definitely EU threatened ban vaccine production export. 

The EU angry get AZ supply hoping for, fine, threatening countries vaccine order timetables really bad. Hey there. little brother Canada, eh? ya send north us bud? might getting fucked EU. Thanks pal. See ya soon hopefully. ""nobody sick"" ... accuracy covid test? get back normal!

Don't spread misinformation -- do, admit wrong.

Thanks. grandma like arm mildly sore it. like jealous lol  It’s 9 per minute. much faster expect be? distribution, logistics, etc make impossible enough people vaccinated reach herd immunity Super Bowl.

I agree haven’t done even close good enough job even had, ideal scenario, wouldn’t ready Super Bowl god, thank articulating better ever could. That’s trial showed, trials also ~35 times fewer people got vaccine. 16 715k would equate like half person 20k people got vaccine clinical trial. So, seems within margin error. wouldn’t alarmed. Ok fuck 88 yo grandma w pace maker still get vaccine? 🙄 “it’s easy” tripe. Yeah we’re living ever changing world. might times future selfless other. Might well get started finding friends groups selfless people. knows. might better people.  right, are. Concern issue with. there's key difference concerned reporting *New COVID mutations could prolong pandemic another year*. One pragmatic approach monitor variant, deliberately designed scare people data back up.

Damn right I'm hopeful. I've barely able leave house year, time I'm able see family it'll almost two years since I've seen them. vaccine what's going bring us shit situation. Maybe ""hopium,"" maybe get bad news, like subreddit seems to. job. It’s person really common! Symptoms thought due body’s immune response, stronger immune system - greater immune response stimulated vaccine - side effects you’ll have. Older people tend less robust immune systems, fewer symptoms.  first heard country's version CDC. actyally used number 40s percentage might wrong, nonetheless link talking maybe less effective south african variant.  is. Nobody understand another saying. get people already, one mask, taking unconsciously clarify say say ""what?"". That's takes. say ""no, take mask off"". clusterfuck cannot express. article insult every person forced risk life there. Every stupid situation I'm forced in. Biden changed jack. encounter single person conscious distancing. F*## this.  I’ve written whole family off, it’s amazing stupidity experienced since COVID came around. simple thing like putting mask on, difficult task majority people. don’t never understand people selfish, even thought selfless people proved wrong. saddens never see world way again. damn used get covid every winter looks like  - worried happen countries Sweden even recommended masks? Last checked still holding out. 

Its fascinating watch, US everything polarized, people disagree anything side it. Liberals complaining anti-vehicle rail US-Canada border 4x4s crossed border illegally. I'm going even bother conservatives opposed simply democrats charge, especially r/coronavirus.

Sweden's response pandemic happens homogeneous, compliant population high trust government gets bad advice. see swedes complaining, see majority perfectly happy path government took this. I'm really curious see Swedes look back over. They’ve going since Jan 11th/12th, deaths still rise. It’s understanding that’s stopped vaccine efforts wasn’t wild. can’t human challenge trials, maybe chimps. Though disease isn’t rampant enough people encounter really need vaccine. honestly expect Novavax's early results SA due small number another confounding factor- Novavax target completely different part virus far know. logic people reduce spread.

No, never said that. people virus currently, people **have had** virus currently immune. realize vast majority people get infected get healthy within couple weeks own, right? tired line. ""you're selfish unless blindly comply every anti-social measure preventing statistically minute possibility might kill someone normal behavior"" bogus false. make sense 60k people dying flu definitely make sense scenario.  


The idea could already infected, vaccinated still require measures people neither definition irrational. Hahahahahahahahaha  know end month right? perception time whack make sure room, first two weeks month terrible last two weeks gotten bit better. fact we're four weeks year shocking part. forget almost 50% United States take vaccine. It’s over....for least. would even drop everything I'm week drive across country get one. second dose! one get tested antibodies? Nebraska governor thinking taking away restrictions whatsoever weekend. hospital cases went way down. guess thought already common knowledge like 9 months ago. Getting virus mean can't get twice, three times, four times, etc. chickenpox. *”Steadily going since New Year”*

Where seeing this? Maybe like 3 states. g’day mate Anybody I’ve seen reaction gets second. severe fever they’ve better within day. agree entirely. 100%. 

But still need teachers person learning right now. It’s worryingly dumb. Even people receptive it, ends equating double fabric masks n95/KF94. say n95 change public debate around it. don’t want to, though, they’d something production subsiding n95 masks whole population. That’s always get garbage like talking masks USA. Interesting, hadn’t seen this. key issue seems whether AZ used best efforts supply accordance delivery schedule, one things take account determining whether best efforts used available manufacturing capacity. AZ allegedly diverted capacity EU U.K. (not sure actually true not), question whether means AZ use “best efforts” whether say use best efforts despite diversion go covid then? Lmao? [This article Nature middle last year tells need know badly EU fucked good websites track different variants spreading?  42 Moderna, 35 Pfizer distortion thruth. EU seizing anything not. 12k tests/day site. ""The contract there, says initial doses made using EU supply chain."" Actually includes 2 sites UK well, plus AZ free build capacity elsewhere fullfill contract.
The AZ uproar big chose hide failure deliver exporting EU sites - thats complying best effort set contract - absolutely failing like Sanofir would be. know true particular case clause 5.1 contract (which refers initial supply) refers best reasonable efforts vaccine manufactured EU. 

Section 5.4 refer vaccine manufactured UK reference additional supply per section 5.4.

Best reasonable effort also defined,  ""in case AstraZeneca, activities degree effort company similar size similarly-sized infrastructure similar resources AstraZeneca would undertake use development manufacture Vaccine at relevant stage development commercialization having regard urgent need Vaccine end global pandemic resulting serious public health issues, restrictions personal freedoms economic impact, across world taking account efficacy safety.""

It could argued previous contractual commitments hindering capacity supply intended capacity. 

But again, lawyer. looks like they've approved ages? you’re less likely exposed everyone else also vaccinated less likely get it.

People imagine aren’t 100% protected, virus free clear like since last March. even it’s hitting brick wall, world everyone partially protected difference running track running wet cement important point. 

Getting one kind vaccine prevent getting booster another type.

Get vaccine get get now. Yes. they're producing any. US long stated ban exports vaccines everyone US vaccinated. best case scenario, summer months.

So leaves Canada importing vaccines Europe. However EU snags EU also banned vaccine exports contract obligations met. think remember reading vaccines still effective yh actual results like trials like J&amp;J. Novavax found 60% efficient South african variant smaller trial. reasonable interpret 5.1 EU demanded would production happening EU straight start. section EU wanted added contract guarantee would production EU.

Would really implicitly put constraints initial doses EU come from?

Like buy TV, seller says they'll make best effort get one depo near you, imply right get TV away depo one near runs them.

/I'm lawyer worried covid, definitely worried shot second dose (Pfizer vaccine) spent night vomiting battling 102 degree fever. call work night. couldn’t walk within 12 hours..... took days able walk normally pain absolutely unbearable 24 hours.

Only one coworker reaction, entire healthcare facility still seems like good odds would still absolutely recommend getting vaccine. prepared recovery time, case. 

Makes wonder actually gotten covid, I’m assuming would terrible reaction well? really don’t know... glad able get vaccine since I’m healthcare worker providing direct care.  completely engulfed fabricated sensational news

Nothing said even true. recommend tone read official statements instead DailyMail. Unsafe work conditions? right free illness. Pathogens around since dawn humanity going absolutely nowhere. deep vein thrombosis. Jesus. 35 42, depending vaccine. Yeah, mobile posting skills leave lot desired. least manage help kids schoolwork, apparently big reach you.

Here's tip, can't care kids, them. true. home health make appointment one patients bc happening ran right arms minister one Friday. said sorry, liquor store closes soon! told Run! Run! lot countries suspect I’d dead. Haha! producing cost! would trade getting one that's pretty good sooner getting one that's slightly better potentially months later. worries - curious - thanks replying. saw another user gave info range 2nd dose makes sense. :) Sorry one, but:

- many already covid thus antibodies fight it?

- many yet exposed virus?

- measure success unless purposely try infect vaccinated? bit eleven months ago, walked last American Literature class. Turns also professor's last ever class. died (of cancer) last September. R.I.P. Dr. Angley 🙏 Hermanos Lusos! Pronto saldremos de este puñetero embrollo! give people JJ vaccines scarce, get Moderna/Pfizer booster months. They’ll SA variant boosters anyway. EU course ;) 

Because regards EU deliveries. Duh. Something people aren’t highlighting - “only” 209,000,000 Americans even eligible vaccine right now. given 8.3 doses per 100 people, number actually higher account fact 25% country can’t get shot. Poteintially end getting people protected possible still safer unrestrained transmission. Even partial protection help body fight faster less time mutate host. &amp; hosts, fewer chances mutate something serious seen around world. shocked already one home grown US variant concern already discovered CA OH - something yet documented. Remember Larado TX hit hard, wondered variant. I've read finally getting testing see so. confirmed whether transmit virus vaccinated. Early data indicate lessen transmission. currently hear professionals recommending masks social distance vaccinate population. scientist, could magically vaccinate everyone overnight, would less calls wear masks social distance following vaccination. People get frustrated able return ""normal"" getting shot, realize normality begin significant portion population receives vaccine. eventually we'd learn live people would stop listening. Lockdown lockdown sustainable would make Great Depression look like good times. common contracts load unknowns like ordering prototype development. company would sign provide vaccines unknowns (signed late September trials properly done) without type clause. way J&amp;J good vaccine. One FDA said anything 50% acceptable. Secondly J&amp;J around 60-70% efficient preventing symptoms 85% efficient severe symptoms hospitlisations. even still develop symptoms vaccine still likely going stop going hospital. Thats key bit want reduce hispitlisations. Thirdly annual flu shot 49% Americans happily take year 40-60% efficient yet say useless. expected fairly high uptake covid vaccines help towards path herd immunity. say J&amp;J good vaccine simply wrong Hang buddy. survived 10 months, survive another 3 There’s real chance pivot using two dose regimen instead. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

I mean wish wasn’t case let’s real. won’t wear masks, aren’t going vaccinate. no, didn’t bother reading article. headline enough. deaths/hospitalizations start plummeting, may take calculated risks. see like taking calculated risk get car drive every day. There's chance could get car wreck die, find worth risk convenience car. Wow, clever, almost pick floor incredible wit.

I tried explain clearly sorry, can't tell difference "" **according senior EU official""** **""according AZ spokesperson"".** I'm guessing think testing gives virus certain someone told that. Skippy! heard awhile. Thanks bringing back classic. However, really check grammar. Especially boasting self proclaimed excellence educating. 

1. ""in behalf"" read ""on behalf""

2. ""skippy"" read ""Skippy""

As state incapable pull myself, look errors even found. said, believe reexamine well education skills extend. bar might set little higher think Bud. ;) never see U.S... we'd never chief anything take public transit. *(Sighs exhaust fumes)* Stop spreading BS everywhere.

&amp;#x200B;

Many health care workers refuse COVID-19 think exactly point. I'm UK wondered hell article said that. would different countries chose use law different one. time could understand UK decided adopt unlimited autobahn policy lol. wouldn’t surprised see move two dose regimen. Worth read hopefully consider petition questions especially Trump gone. It’s rare children die Covid it’s harmful keeping home. kids still wear masks whenever go back anyway. yeah dumb lockdown measure government taken. know that's truth. get tired doomsday prophets. Even objectively GOOD news, they'll still find way spin bad thing. like loving crap, pulling pandemic last long possible. Sure that's celebrities getting vaccine first.. major point. arm trial take place South Africa, resistant variant, even UK variant around Pfizer Moderna trials. Wonder prevent severe effect death? misunderstanding something here? Okay mean it’s better protection none. virus transmittable, risk higher let mfs mutate escaping immune response. That’s don’t want show would start again. 

And I’m concerned people won’t let take first J&amp;J vax time later two shot mRNA vaccine. page 39 list primary manufacturing sites, naming several plants EU UK. substance manufacturing REDACTED (FR/BE), REDACTED (I/NL), REDACTED (UK) REDACTED (UK).”
“Drug product manufacturing REDACTED (ITL), REDACTED (DE), REDACTED (UK) potential issue vaccines UK UK- first 100M doses. generic facility making doses generally AZ sell anywhere.

There shortfall EU issue EU AZ. can't take doses back sold already. like supermarket trying take chocolate bars back bag customer walking doors, put shelf another customer.

“J&amp;J’s results show measures stay us longer people think”

“J&amp;J’s results show Covid going stay us” dozen states reporting drops 25% new covid-19 cases 1,200 counties seen same, federal data released Wednesday shows. Experts say plunge may relate growing fear virus reached record-high levels, well soaring hopes getting vaccinated soon.

Nationally, new cases dropped 21% prior week, according Department Health Human Services data, reflecting slightly 3,000 counties. Corresponding declines hospitalization death may take days weeks arrive, battle deadly virus rages record levels many places.

Health officials, data modeling experts epidemiologists agreed early see bump vaccine rollout started health care workers late December has, many states, moved include older Americans.

Instead, said, factors involved likely behavior-driven, people settling back home holidays, or reacting news of hospital beds running places like Los Angeles. Others finding resolve wear masks physically distance prospect vaccine becoming immediate.

A single reason hard pinpoint, said Adriane Casalotti, chief government public affairs National Association County City Health Officials. said may due part people hoping avoid new, contagious variants virus, some experts say appear deadlier well.

She also said many people got sick last surge people may taking precautions: ""There's better chance know someone it,"" Casalotti said.

Eva Lee, mathematician engineering professor Georgia Institute Technology, works models predicting covid patterns. said email decline reflects natural course virus infects social web people, exhausts cluster, dies emerges new groups.

She also said national trend, even steeper drops California, also reflects restrictions state, included closing indoor dining 10 p.m. curfew hard-hit regions. said measures take weeks show new-case data.

""It unstable equilibrium moment,"" Lee wrote email. ""So premature celebration would lead another spike, seen time US.""

Four California counties among five large U.S. counties seeing steepest case drops, including Los Angeles County, new cases declined nearly 40% week ending Jan. 25, compared week before.

Dr. Karin Michels, chair epidemiology UCLA Fielding School Public Health, said lower numbers L.A. virus infected 1 8 county residents likely mirror happened New York City's surge: People got scared changed behavior.

""People beginning understand really need get act together L.A., helps,"" said. ""The big fear [now] 'Is really going direction, plateauing, going go?' need go down, really high.""

Michels said herd immunity would explain declines, since we're nowhere near level 70% population disease vaccinated. said declines may also reflect drop testing, Dodger Stadium converted mass testing site mass vaccination center.

Officials California Department Public Health acknowledged testing fallen off, overall rates positive covid tests falling, suggesting change real.

New cases also fell significantly Wyoming, Oregon, South Dakota Utah, state recording least 30% fewer new cases. states reported vaccinated 8% adult population Tuesday, putting among top 20 states terms vaccination rate.

Alaska leads states currently, nearly 15%, according HHS. also logged new-case drop 24% recent days.

Yet experts willing say yet vaccines driving cases down.

""Most people public health think we'll see benefit vaccine months now,"" said Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer Association State Territorial Health Officials.

The number deaths continues remain high weeks high case rates virus variably attacks heart, kidneys, lungs nervous system. Many patients remain unconscious ventilator weeks doctors search signs improvement.

The death rate fell 5% data posted Wednesday, reflecting 21,790 patients died virus Jan. 19-25.

""The concern everything could change,"" said Kate Yeiser, spokesperson Multnomah County Health Department.

From article There’s probably element contract frustration going on. AZ tries send UK made stuff EU withou Boris’s explicit approval blam! export restrictions. might well moon far EU concerned, matter contract says. 

Probably kind compromise hammered coming days. Ursula making lots noise cover fact someone least double checked U.K. production truly unencumbered export. incredibly heroic assumption EU make. 

Apparently Pfizer’s European operations rely gunk sourced U.K. too, escalates it’ll go badly billion souls planet. definitely felt sick enough go hospital, didn't. really struggling breathe. decided needed go hospital, middle night. want wake family scare them, considered taking Uber. sick get dressed go downstairs outside. thought copay ER, decided way going go hospital got sick enough passed someone called ambulance. importantly definition EU sites limited interpretation 5.4 only. apply 5.1. Worrying unknown side effects cannot compared cult. say 100% certainty side effects. Unless pro vaxx cult :p People different trust risk aversion levels. point exactly? Ratio vaccines per capita - UK EU 170 countries 4:1:0.00001. completely agree 1:1:1 arguing gap greater EU UK. counters argument. public doctors Atlanta asked Perry  Immortality come! Teachers people seem think teaching high priority society, they're constantly campaigning keep schools closed. 

If think teachers pull bait switch, well, let inform you, that's exactly happened Fairfax County, Va. Teacher got vaccine promise returning in-person teaching. they've gotten vaccine, they've said ""just kidding"" still refusing return in-person teaching. really think teachers across country thing teachers Northern Virginia did?

Teachers San Francisco basically signaling intention bait switch ahead time. But, hospitals idiotically still putting San Francisco teachers priority list. Sucks freezer failed awesome doses didn’t go waste. Nearing half million people US died COVID vs one anecdote may may related vaccine. depending high transmission I've read might need 95% vaccination get herd immunity.

I would happy take J&amp;J, AZ, whatever *now* time booster get whatever considered best might luxury choice. Anything slow cursed virus mutates even viler form this. All. Of. This. AZ plants UK, leased UK government. AZ choice honour UK contract AZ said.

Besides UK production tiny relative EU shortfall, would barely make dent. locations, yes. Others, no. Here's blog post found (the author also wrote similar piece Financial Times, blog post seems detail) -
 see actual contract issue here, contractual language quoted blog seems suggest clause going much effect either side issue. clause ""estimated delivery schedule"" would seem relevant ""best efforts"" clause. likely lot people post covid issues post flu issues covid contagious flu spread many people flu year. post viral syndromes real viruses absolutely surprise covid behaving like every virus. sad past people post viral syndrome often ignored real course treatment, trend seems continuing long covid. “long covid” nothing new, we’re aware it’s happening greater numbers never said that. seem oddly triggered. EU commission already investigation refusing release information vaccine procurement Freedom Information already refused provide information European parliament.

As part Americans giving shit. That's true far many people. They're vocal idiots dumb can't help miss them. sadly, personally know who've died. husband store restaurant seen anyone socially since late last February.

I'm sure far one.

It's going fascinating see things look next couple months significant chunk population vaccinated there's lot ""have's"" among ""have nots"" Rallyparakeet, thought you’re better that! lot people don’t give solitary shit anyone else, teachers included. vaccines targeted original strain. would expect similar reductions effectiveness South Africa Brazil strains. afford wait. Nobody enjoys masks. understand it’s hard couple months population adequately vaccinated. wear mask 8 hours day. It’s end world. Yeah. 100M Vaccinated/or shots people still pretty agressive goal 100 Days.

But clear biden administration plans ramping massively next 2 months. surprised get close heard immunity end march people age(27) younger left that.

I've always believed able get vaccine mid April may. might things go well. whole comment TRUTH. 

Reality is, nearly Americans know like 5 people least infected completely fine. certain point, stop caring.

I'm late 20s lived Arizona/FL would go party. fucking cares. point human history ""normal"" healthy people sacrifice livelihoods protect sick/old/weak. nearly fucking year. think many hesitant go along measures begin with? Governments never give back power gain population. Ok problem. like seeing actual footage China.

Teachers right health care workers IMO. act like they’re making shit annoy you. That’s true, nobody gives shit you. answer scientists bloody interviews. non-scientist spokes people that. bound factual information making statements latitude make leaps logic, include non-factual considerations.

 say lie, make things whole sale, say ""Here facts, also think....which x."" even importantly, facts people producing facts (the scientists), somewhat insulated loss public trust.

I'm also beginning think ""less more."" daily briefings, near constant interviews actually helpful. amount new information actually great gives many opportunities make statements negative impact. Sometimes, winning move keep mouth shut. reporter can't ask question like this, interview.  New Zealand entered chat... Australia New Zealand count? I'm thinking time get vaccine, multiple options available. sure selective us time might make extended trip find specific one want go route. think that. biological process. cells can't pushed multiply faster. healthcare continued overloaded brink many areas 

where/ contributes spread. 

Fewer people get infected contributes spread? Please explain works. You’re gonna wear mask nobody saying avoid social contact this. restaurants bars already open want go out. goal always keep healthcare system collapsing masks necessary large enough chunk population vaccinated. calling US egocentric something think EU do, difference many countries’ entire vaccination programs stake? Wow really. Goes show misinformation used cover incompetence. sympathize, agree people mind business. criticize finding level risk.

However, people got quit loose history. happened period history refer one end spectrum, basically social darwinism. complaining like Cultural Rev. -- dangerous different.

It troubles everybody thinks side good, actually two distinct kinds goodness-destroying extremism. oppose one form extremism extremely, susceptible other.

Y'all really need vaccines point? would accurate headline  Accuracy counts. Thank you. trying quick response question addressing several others come well. medications patients take similar reasons (pain, fever, inflammation) includes aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen. taken getting vaccine, seeing headlines causing great deal worry. Initially included those, classes NSAID analgesic added description anti-platelet, antipyretic, started go road separate pharmacology bit, decided TLDR material, cut much out. process failed carefully keep correct distinctions place. 

As comments post correctly noted, medications indeed different classes different mechanisms.

**L’Eveilleur Quantique**

Your post reported reinstated misinformation debunked - people like genuine qualifications one area science (genetics, case) pontificate knows nothing (virology) really dangerous. get take her. travelers community spread?

As noted article articles too, two cases 501.V2 (""South Africa"") detected South Carolina different parts state, appear unrelated neither recent travel history. contributes spread. vast majority population yet. We're side hill yet population actively keeping spreading (i.e. that's kinda herd immunity is). Well, I’m decision maker, feel threshold least vaccines available everyone. Again, think it’s extremely disrespectful get vaccine cavort around among people desperately want one can’t get one potentially spreading disease. That’s really ask personally... keep restrictions vaccines accessible all. That’s real opinion this. really isn’t far away, least countries. 

I feel like vaccines biggest precaution get. everyone get one, don’t see much reason keep things closed. It’s bit calloused, don’t care happens people choose get one, people CANT going take bigger personal responsibility, sucky is.

I know there’s “threshold,” it’s definitely lower point we’re still logging well 100k cases day. warn people going feel ill 24 hours 2nd dose (although first dose possible too). impossible know going feel ill isn't. people advised take day work get dose. thing is, 24 hours feeling crappy vaccine beats weeks feeling crappy actual virus. DEFINITELY beats dying. 

The first friend mine get vaccine felt awful first dose. second dose phase husband ended going hike next day since work. funny everyone seems different experiences it. Turkey's failure shove migrants EU last year make clear repeat 2015 happening again. Sorry burst bubble. also small village provence Brabant. youre willing take trip, visit Crimea, Moscow, Rome, America, New Amsterdam ""wash dick"" one day Netherlands.
You even go scary fantasy country call Belgium. public decide pandemic ends. never went full lockdown (not part US ever did) part. still restrictions much areas. lot pro-virus people areas. certainly deserve first, odds bought way competition opinion I'm glad going well guys, every step forward good everyone. literally deal semantics hypocrisy. assured someone sub yesterday Scotland every right publish NDA it. So, friend asked (he believe vaccines) find answer, go.

How come inject something cold (-70 °C) die? So, UK government placed orders early gave AZ opportunity actually build facilities first place. 1-0 UK.  part commitment AZ agreed 100% fulfill UK orders prior export. 2-0.

The EU comes along 3months later gives order get Belgium supply chain order, surprise surprise, it’s 3 months behind. direct consequence EU bureaucracy. EU goal. 3-0.

No everyone contract amount sabre rattling make EU right. 

Subtext - UK moved unilaterally, maybe got bit lucky well. EU can’t stand it! Please try again. think date parsing bug. first saw headline, thinking quit, actually read it, realised really bad... bus empty, took mask noticed people entering, admitted simple mistake. better things upset about, really big deal.  worry, corporations new friends! Lots blacked lines. Great. Ah yes seems case!! Yeah that's nut shell. UK first orders ordered 3 months eu. Eu saying 3 month delay end shouldnt affect order. ""we reject principle first come first served"", ursula sounding like drunk McDonald's 3am. They're cake eating it. public mess AZ making vaccine profit justify trump move banning export Pfizer realised fucked unnecessary EU bureaucracy delays. Well isn’t complete 180 don’t know is. quote referring EU's competing agreements, AZ's I'm sure Serbians know that. Anyways, developed germans, vast, vast majority manufactured americans. pedantic get away it! 2 questions, curious people's point view:

Do think okay hop plane today travel freely second vaccine? recovered covid? 

Assume following local regulations whatever else U.K. exports lipids Pfizer vaccine. Far ban export  Europe set get 1/3 ordered amount q1. Uk production issues. 

Naturally, company tells eu cannot deliver due issues, questions arise. 

Either issues affect everyone equally AZ fucking us. 

Eu bully here. Youre thinking straight  Fucken oath m8, complaints Sweden well throughout pandemic, said many countries used different strategies.

This. People obsessed Sweden. reference potential competing agreements members states, UK not. Respect + won't, experts will. tests taken, they're sent sequencing, think. UK offered capacity countries. Depends quality. Sweden good too. Stop pretending like know like. Decisions literally made scientists health authority, politicians. Yes data says could nearly 50% reduction still would fall within bounds study found. Meaning statistically means nothing. said found statistically significant impact impact. rule positive impact masks.

Also far mechanics masks go one plenty showing well even basic masks perform.

Here another study' showing large decreases infection rate. confidence interval shows clear benefit.

There literally piles case studies showing support masks. swear there's another population study somewhere can't find anywhere right now. Pretty sure relates conflicting agreements Commission signs

Edit: event AstraZeneca's ability fulfill its
obligations Agreement impeded competing agreement entered by
or behalf Commission, No.

Why? butchers list 'people matter'?

Is butchers live EU? dont spit bullshit think eu state believe AstraZeneca said UK contract says UK gets first priority vaccines made UK plants. question AstraZeneca breaking contract considered ""reasonable best effort"". would imagine could make case reasonable expect company break prior contact order meet yours. Sounds like something decided court. UK contract kind irrelevant though. Presumably AZ promised first 100 million doses UK plants UK promised EU UK plants would used fulfil order AZ fucked signed conflicting contracts, invalidate EUs claims. hell? comparing population densities entire countries, Sweden unhabitated forest? literally pointless. Sweden one urbanized countries Europe, know. could sworn said 20 160k... edit it? ""You can't blame guy charge! That's fair."" AstraZeneca's worse. couple others failed stopped. sure following you. Even without vaccination everyone contracts Covid within given week. 0.4% people got vaccinated *and* lost Covid lottery. really familiar numbers Israel, results seem general ballpark would expect given claimed efficacy. believe AstraZeneca said UK contract says UK gets first priority vaccines made UK plants. question AstraZeneca breaking contract considered ""reasonable best effort"". would imagine could make case reasonable expect company break prior contact order meet yours. Sounds like something decided court. Reserved initially UK UK order fulfilled switch EU. That's UK contract states, looks like that's covered eu contract. 

""AstraZeneca shall deemed breach Agreement result delay due aforementioned competing agreement(s)""

The crux breaking contractual obligation UK constitutes reasonable effort, not, definition best reasonable effort. Yes appears section 6.2 EU competing agreements, AstraZeneca. likely UK would block that.

The EU either force AZ honor agreement (and deliver whoever else supply to) ultimately blocking export AZ factories block Biontech export UK equivalent AZ doses come there. Ugly cases. still talking? agreement AZ member state far I'm aware. UK participating member state. contract U.K., signed 3 months EU one, states U.K. production facilities shall used vaccines destined U.K. ship AZ vaccines EU, AZ breach contract well. become exceedingly efficient it?

Go ahead tell Neo function is. care contracts.

You daft hypocrite.  good comparison basically need UK contract. Besides, crucial parts payments, delivery dates, amounts due dates redacted. "" extent AstraZeneca’s performance this
Agreement impeded competing agreements, AstraZeneca shall deemed breach Agreement result delay due aforementioned competing agreement(s). ""

Seems important *Biontech Thats funny way saying ""no sharing, uk first, fuck whats right contracts"". remember hearing would use UK sites, they'd use UK 100mil doses. guess wait see fulfilling contract means break 100mil doses requirement using UK sites. refers agreements ""entered behalf Commission"", think relevant conflict all. amount, 300 million initial doses option 100 million additional doses. help us much get specific dates amounts. kinda history splitting things... reason famous people took vaccines past. Seeing respected famous people take vaccine helps ease people's mind. Espcially African American community that's skeptical due things like Tuskegee experiments. 

One dose regime worth price. like he's random rich person. He's household name pretty much every black person knows tons respect part.

In recent press conferences Biden administration specifically mentioned working community leaders address vaccine hesitancy. it. Tyler Perry start. exclude UK facilities, means EU would prefer doses come facility inside EU ye covid season next season USA show? cannot find trailer...

Seems bit hypocritical You’re right. Lol looked number kept basing .004%. pissed market 450 million people.

And potentially kill many thousands denying EU opportunity source extra vaccine elsewhere Lool bs article. Europe behind. UK slightly ahead US vaccinations they'll probably first ones crush US. Although really Australia/NZ first ones crush covid they're back normal pretty much hence they're also rush start vaccinations. US done rather well far vaccinations claim first crush covid true lol. indeed confusing inconsistency 5.1 5.4, however might 'best reasonable effort' case could advantage EU. like saying ""you use best reasonable effort produce initial doses within EU"", technically denying use manufacturing sites. 5.4 explicitly includes UK non-eu sites. 

Just opinion, lawyer fauci said changed percentage based thought public could accept. honest coming someone supposed science facts. logic it. 

The logic EU messed rather admit wants deflect shift blame. EU go nuclear declare vaccines Public Goods making patents associated IP free open license. step, many companies could contribute production and/or speed development competing vaccines. 

The developing world behind EU S. Africa, India countries expressed similar demands. double checked card, that's written down. 🤷‍♀️ Go it. Damn, remember originally claimed 15% resistant antibodies??? figure lot worse firm number, promise make best effort.  saying legal obligation supply vaccine Europe 4 factories. we're getting lot first doses administered (close million day) expect 2nd doses administered start rising disadvantaged people.  51-year-old Tyler Perry get vaccine, normal 51-year-olds can’t? Rich elitism, much?  I'm sick US propaganda. They're fucking arrogant!

By time they've ""crushed"" pandemic millon people probably died it, due disaster caused it. sure....they're really crushing 🙄 NZ never endless lockdowns lool one initial lockdown back March last year. Theybhad short lockdown Auckland back August. since initial lockdown pretty much back normal. Europe one countless lockdowns That’s EU contract states  nanobots go smoother second time /s delivering around third promised first quarter. Remember one thing scientists said early that, rigorous study various data, turned wrong since they’ve repeatedly emphatically said opposite first thing? Remember thing clinging to? Stats student here. 

For sample size tens thousands, frequentist confidence interval Bayesian credible interval almost indistinguishable. 

For particular Pfizer paper, Bayesian credible interval 90.3 97.6% frequentist version 90.0 97.9%. 

In details, beta-binomial distribution, prior used equivalent adding 0.6 case vaccine group 1.0 case placebo group (on top observed 8 cases vaccine vs 162 cases placebo). dad got second dose recently. 

Background: He’s 75 year old Covid survivor. got first dose month almost dying Covid. 

The first dose gave little soreness arm. second dose wiped out. fever 103°F 3 days. physically weak couldn’t walk 24 hours after. became dehydrated, BP dropped point almost take ER IV fluids. little scary. 3 days second dose, fine.

ETA: got Pfizer vaccine. parents bit like I'll tell said last time talked them. said get vaccinated spring, go outdoor dining summer. asked indoor dining since they'd vaccinated, said still seemed risky. said depending things going fall would go indoor dining. me, second two weeks I've fully vaccinated (which hopefully soon bc work education education workers next state), I'm going going wherever want without worry mind.

Also remember reading high number agoraphobic 20-something men Japan developing subculture, refused leave rooms lived parents. I'd interesting see US develops subculture people stay common error. Deaths trail weeks even months. CFR outbreak looks really low start. Witness ""CFR Korea China outside Wuhan 0.5%"", ""CFR Iceland basically 0"", ""cases rising hospitalizations deaths remain low. virus lost virulence?"".

So yeah, need wait weeks see vaccine-caused deaths. /s Crushed pile unnecessary bodies Keep mind scale. whole country pretty much uses one airport commercial flights. There’s virtually domestic flights. NYC alone 3 major airports. Domestic travel huge part US flight operations.

Just example size disparity here. Israel basically single US city budget greater many nations. deaths per 100,000 people. bad European countries, significant compared Denmark (34.62), Norway (10.28) Finland (11.87). Nope. shit never going away. Vaccines aren’t gonna shit South African strain that’s already way infectious. 

We’re stupid slow spread, keep evolving reach beat it. life now. SAME! Teacher here; want soooo bad! mean selfish uneducated. Concidering extremely low incidents allergic reactions, especially compared conventional vaccines, need ditch 15 minute wait shot, drive thru, need even park get car. would lot easier ignore reality around leave ""worrying"" professionals guess unquestioned obedience towards authority never style practically make sense make plans based around uncertainties beyond control.

Basically I'm position back announced 2 week lockdown is, two weeks actually sufficient control virus, probably necessary begin with. hand, isn't, basically fucked matter contagious.
Going back flu vaccine, seem smart put much faith given limited flu vaccine typically effectiveness. crush crushed “A teacher job effectively premises.”

No, can’t. That’s point. 

Remote learning exceedingly poor, bordering useless, substitute in-person school. Period. There’s polishing turd. Na. USA shitshow orange donkey decided make wearing masks political topic. like ""if like Trump, wear red clothes"". Yep apparently workers lives matter. get it, bad symptoms? pathogenesis? What’s severity?  Bingo. get people fail understand this. 

Taiwan New Zealand probably super low rates point. mean numbers positives BS. sea otters apart daily essential trips Even slow ass state (WI) jumped full percent past 24 hours IIRC. Tell it, stud 10% young people covid aren’t hospital. Complete bullshit number true, would capacity whole time numbers overall lower needing test many? sure Germany France now, testing much yet still maintaining &lt;3% positive rate that's better state NC testing 60k people day still coming positivity rates 7-11% range given day. predictable. soon Fauci said ""it's common sense wear 2 masks"", mocking memes ""well, 3 masks?? 4 masks?? 777 masks??"" appeared instantly.

Fauci honestly great messenger. Listen press conferences talks minutes end gets way weeds. public spokesman someone keeps things simple sound bites. 

""Wear mask, helps stop spread."" End, full stop, period, more. Don’t make numbers. betting farm one. Also, New Zealand would like word.

Both countries already ""crushed"" it. Australia 12 days zero community transmission third time New South Wales completely eliminated virus. curiosity, father think life US get back 'normal'? Israel? Israel western country now? new strain causes existing vaccines effective? turns risky people certain age take it?

You can't worry every hypothetical, especially high-level CDC employee, there's probably nothing it.

We make projections based know today, current vaccines seemingly effective new strains (and even *less* effective, still considerably so). Hospitalizations key metric watch, see us tightening business restrictions unless hospitals start getting overwhelmed boss tried assure lockdowns China could never happen USA

To fair, absolutely state USA experienced lockdowns scale happened China (or Europe lockdowns either matter)... we're bitching 25% restaurant capacity people China literally leave homes. One really good friends lives Sweden. everything told me, surprising. uncommon person grocery store public transit wearing mask. friends going dinner restaurants, taking indoor yoga classes, etc. like they're living different universe there. shocking case counts higher, quite frankly. joke article.

The UK Israel vaccinations pet capita. New Zealand Australia already crushed virus. realize kind messaging gives Fox news fans even fuel fire? Half country laughing latest ""recommendation"". public health messaging Covid horrible. IMO, point, harm good yet continue on. let toxic authoritarian mentality.

It seems like benefit doubt stupid. said weeks ago crucified redditors. Pathetic No, social. organized events local atheist community — restaurants, canoe trips, bike rides, kinds stuff. also active voluntary simplicity movement. facilitated 7 week classes simplifying one’s life happier enjoy life more. 

After COVID return activities gladly. 

Until then, isolate. best keep sense humor it. Lllllloooolllll. Man, love Aussies. folks live Melbourne lived shitshow lockdown. 

But I’m “good” state US, barely open gym mate. get you’re coming from, return normal 6-9 months away US, risk. 

Y’all pack Docklands fine...I’d swap day. Everything going well. Except pace, amiright? goal one thing, forcing unnecessary. could've simply said March 1 would ideal. Yes. happens regular basis. Nothing concerned about.  saw Viral Sepsis open Slayer show Chicago look death rates closer, picture similar. US 1.3 deaths per 1000, EU 1 death per 1000. doesn’t seem like lot shots. get vaccine , people really go normally ( aka masks social distancing) ? turns actually governing means govern. Nah, man, never got it, weird thing months ago bad flu everyone around died almost died, super weird. Getting better weeks ago, 40% doses were administered in California. Now, state administered around 61%. Right? see headlines like day day day ever think is, ""oh fuck bullshit"" That's defeatist attitude.

I'm also awe nature maintain balance planet. issue Covid. issue we've handled it. world people get 2 strains once?  That's lot less 80 90 million doses demanding March. would line 40 50 promising though.

Limiting vaccine people age 65 dependent AZ providing data effectiveness vaccine people 65. seems unlikely time EU runs priority 1 people vaccinate vaccine proven either effective ineffective age real issue really Pfizer/BioNTech, company actually making profits delivering first highest bidders cannot keeps commitments EU (but getting paid more...) latter two German, attack British/Swedish firm instead, 

The reason Biontech/Pfizer critizised less AZ German, said fulfill agreed first quarter transparent reason delay.

The agreement Pfizer/Biontech AZ deliveries quarter. AZ said would deliver promised doses first quarter Biontech/Pfizer said still deliver doses first quarter would delay January deliveries. Completely different attack British/Swedish firm instead, whos vaccine EU even approved yet, selling cost, first come first served basis. next EU, demand AZ use production India EU?

The timing approval completely irrelevant since agreement EU would produce vaccination campaign starts problem said would provide agreed upon numbers first quarter course sheer size selling cost,

That irrelevant, might producing cost received free money built production infrastructure course keep assets pandemic over. victims, CEO get's still paid, workers absolutely profit expansion assets free money first come first served basis.

That pretty nonsensical. made agreement EU EU tell capacities were. offered capacity thought fulfill contract said so. AZ use production India EU?

According EU AZ explicitly offered production capacity EU including UK capacities, Indian capacities mentioned fact EU screwed pooch big time, took long commit ordering vaccines, expected many come market approved quickly thus spread orders thinly.

I disagree, EU ordered enough vaccines vaccinate whole population EU, actually ordered enough vaccinate way people. sourced different providers using different technologies enough even providers wont deliver all, enough vaccine give every EU citizen access vaccines surprised see follow Hungrys lead bypass EU

I see problem buying Russian vaccine currently contact EMA apply. Hungarian government though acting mostly populist usually, since even using vaccines getting EU currently. Deaths per capita runs lot issues, place better job others reporting COVID-related deaths. There's lot incentive governments downplay COVID deaths occur within jurisdiction. look death rate, EU 1 thousand, US 1.3 thousand. use 1.8x cases per capita 1.3x deaths per capita. Either way, significantly worse EU, within ballpark. normal get runny nose walking 24 degree weather?

I say is, would like know well. I'm suffering ""extreme Covid fatigue"". I'm sorry, empathy left. matter, requiring negative antibody tests vaccines that's moot point. hoping something death rate per capita several times higher Nordic neighbours, lower several European countries opted lockdowns.  mean tell $PORT$ may face financial ruins players make $200 million contracts kick ball around? Oh no, say so. What's bad news AZ? happy city values school staff vaccinate them!! &lt;3 got second dose Pfizer first week January. knocked ass. haven’t weak whole body ache sore ever. worse mono second time college. woke middle night went sat hot hot shower. symptoms lasted 24 hours.  handful dentists know would willing administer vaccinated. states dental society working see get involved. work needles daily, pretty sure hit landmark numb individual nerve, hit muscle. Let guess, “social distancing” years Covid jokes mine fumes pandemic. job keeps work 6 days week, 12-14 hours day. social life. Hey brother  Sounds reasonable new strain causes existing vaccines effective? turns risky people certain age take it? 
There lot indications going tidy resolution people expecting. mention would take would new type pandemic start entire thing beginning.

Hopefully right unfortunately right predictions, even going back pre-lockdown boss tried assure lockdowns China could never happen USA. Asymptomatic though!!   course vaccinated then. even in-person healthcare workers want vaccines gotten yet various circumstances beyond state's control. good faith effort plan get teachers done asap good enough teachers? Teachers, people, know perfection reasonable goal. ship inject first batches spoil, Wow!!! data coming Israel next month quite telling countries expect. Getting closer closer 2 million day! Hope end February start seeing that. Exactly. really surprised people realise given said they're sure transmit virus still not. ""Now, Maccabi analyzed control group Israelis similar age health profiles vaccinees, composed entirely people haven’t infected received shots.""

I think mention maccabi's customers applies vaccinated. 2.7m data could israeli government. r/MapsWithoutNZ Wow guys already nailed origin specific cities throwing shade LOL. One friend groups (my main one) mostly done same, although try keep touch still wanting hang feel safe again.

We've done things virtually much. I'm person group stopped hanging out, two guys stopped also waiting least vaccine, might contribute us open invitation come join whenever feel comfortable so. grandma second doze 2 days said. I’ll gladly take feeling badly couple days means 95% less likely get Covid definitely should. anyone said this? Monday though...I'm confused.

This amazing news though! Total cases? Probably however Death data unrepresentative actual situation. see uptick average deaths year beside reported COVID deaths plus next impossible hide hundreds thousands dead body democracy.

 Also ancedotally, one point getting 60k+ cases day members family/friend circle contracted virus. family member even contend almost 0 availability ICU bed hear stories anymore. Everyone know healthcare sector also says COVID wards almost empty deaths even lower. Sure public transports working reduced capacity apart (and select regions), rest country almost opened back yet uptick cases. really strange think deserves case study. densely populated area country hit first travelers Europe. states opportunity learn northeast went thru. safe say every single covid cell tiny bit different it’s parents could called variant? No, wont create booster, create vaccine strains.  doesn’t love re-runs?

I admitted hospital absolutely full transferred. midnight moved one wing another bc trying make room 15 admits. There’s bed shortage people stuck stretchers days time (I lucked out). Truly, it’s nice picture... take admission, there’s way know patient two days six weeks. *scary* need *scared*. Yes thoughts exactly. think AZ useful normal strain accept Novovax useful SA strain. really think scientist gives shit you’re feeling? Everything needs proven. 49% south african variant No, 92% reduction risk relative unvaccinated people. doesn’t mean 8% vaccinated people got infected; that’s way high!

If there’s 10,000 unvaccinated people 100 got infected relevant time frame, 10,000 vaccinated people, 8 got infected. That’s 92% efficacy. normal worry bit no, huge impact. good. others said US head start let tons population get infected also probably killed vulnerable old ppl preexisting conditions. ""just let die"" strategy course end pay off. Except places like China New Zealand say governments hardcore willing it; delayed tried anything else could realized gotten control option shut down. problem highly contagious disease like time see control already late easily slow again, always see ""why cases still increasing we're locked down?!"" reactions next.

I think social distancing actually considered one softer measures started appears like easy thing do. wanted believe originally things could keep running people spaced apart more. area. may travel though. Tuskegee Experiment looms large lot people's minds.  all. got vaccine, given form fill asked name, date birth ive pre existing medical conditions. asked wanted left arm right arm. never asked confirm am. Early found daily briefings invaluable conveying severity pandemic need everyone implement mitigation measures Remember pissed everyone media “lying” leaked reports 8% efficacy people older 65? Turns wasn’t lie. One Scottish Tory MP said know stockpile vaccinated many per 100 despite number vaccines per 100. Canada trouble cold storage? leave someones porch fine. still vaccinated transmit virus. can't travel. Imagine someone vaccinated going country Europe good place causing even damage?  post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  40000 people came US China time well

The ""ban"" PR actual policy  Younger people average violent reactions older people. observed noted trials. 

There's also anecdotal evidence second dose worse first *unless already covid*. event, first shot worse. gets brought occasionally r/covidvaccinated  something real concrete place. moved line, front elderly, informed, vaccines. moved goalposts again. know come harsh. think folks unrealistic expectations long people like keep sacrificing. almost 1 year and, lets pretend, huge sacrifice. Young people suffering fallout consequences Covid. point, let virus rip through. stopping point. wish asshole not, it’s literally potentially killing people come contact with. People playing mental health card sure seem completely unaffected peoples death conscience. can’t believe people come justify absolute selfishness narcissism.
Anyway, directed apologies. Nothing concrete, zero side effects, even sore arm. Figure it’s easier assume get hopes up, wind maybe pleasantly surprised later excellent odds! Enough anyone getting reinfected run buy lottery ticket.

I getting second shot eight days. month goes by, way get test antibodies make sure I'm 5% vaccine work for? wish people understood instead blindly insisting every political figure must absolutely good absolutely bad every instance Yes, that's called anecdotal evidence.

I could say councillor Preston rushed hospital 20 minutes vaccination 24 hours emergency care.

Does mean happens everyone? many Based what? absolutely zero science says children need vaccinated. realize, assume, earliest, vaccine available 12’s sometime late 2022. really think, spite evidence contrary, children remain school total 2 1/2 academic years? vulnerable time lives gaining knowledge social skills. 

People believe either don’t kids, hate kids lives. Way. difference likely caused individual immune response vaccine brand. entire unit got Pfizer vax. None us reaction first dose sore arm second dose varied widely - mildly sore arm fever/vomiting/headache/back pain/chills, etc. Age medical history seem play part severe reaction, back normal within 48 hours receiving vaccine. happy gotten would gladly again. worried South African Variant delaying normalcy? vaccinate everyone three times could logistical nightmare folks I've registered appointments, 15 minutes norm history reactions vaccines want stay 30 think got placebo? Countries leader took seriously done well, countries leader played done badly.

Populations look leaders guidance.

Sadly simple lot people many peripheral friends. outgoing. Altogether social life changed much this. pandemic done would like get little more. understand 1920s roaring. necessarily. US diverse population, lack diversity big deal many international trials. is, however, possible international trials meet US standards. UK bit diverse population countries, there's chance.

AstraZeneca meet US standards internationally variety reasons, like trial design. Tories accuse SNP sitting stockpile vaccine. SNP paperwork show that's true, Tories threaten make public.

Can anyone really defend Tories here? Let's shut grocery stores, food supply, manufacturing! Great idea! /s Pfizer, sore arm bad headache next day second shot. borders states

And would insane hold event like wedding cities lockdown 1 quarentine worker gets aunt really felt like hell couple days first dose it’s making worried sign grandma. I’m hoping grandmas doctor convinces (my grandma speaks little English aunt charge medical decisions.)  Guys long ago 14 days flatten curve? know shipments actually going up, counting extra dose vial now? mean always ask get needle put arm right? typical side effects immune response. There's even recommendations take OTC drugs suppress side effects likely suppressing immune response, leading weaker protection. 

Younger people tend stronger immune systems, makes sense side effects stronger. Also 2nd shot worse, immune system ready 2nd time. vaccine data published also noted side effects stronger younger cohorts. trials FDA demand redo? Canada pls infections occurred time Britain experiencing jump COVID-19 caused contagious variant. preliminary analysis found half trial participants became infected mutated version. numbers small Novavax said suggest vaccine nearly 96 per cent effective older coronavirus nearly 86 per cent effective new variant.


This great. hope continues hold true full data set available Bloomberg update: total. 1.7M update vs 1.3M update last week (up 31%). Rolling weekly average 1.21M 1.26M. got first dose US trial yesterday, pretty sure got placebo hope trial goes well here! Maybe I'm wrong title misleading? vaccine require 2 doses far they've done 22 million doses? know thread pretends variants possibly concern

50% probably still good enough, that's real damage efficacy. faux unions demanded get moved line vaccines. began getting vaccine, moved goalposts one time location neither necessary horizon. 

Do think, face health authority’s reams studies saying kids safe person instruction schools don’t drive risk, teachers vaccinated ethically refuse teach kids vaccine doesn’t even exist administered kids? think children continue receive sub par education least another school year, more? Really?

Furthermore, act like teachers people expected jobs. cops fight crime zoom? support surgeons Skyping work? 

What really absurd rejection science says schools safe, entitlement teachers jumped front Grandma vaccines still refusing jobs. 

Disclaimer: wife public school first grade teacher (16 years) embarrassed ‘unions’. know kids huge germ carriers.

That proven case covid: 

""We know"", ""it common sense"" lines get hear ignorant people care scientific evidence. society disproportionately values certain groups people.  
With people, society care they're trouble, someone who's part business owners/""job creators"" class trouble asks help, suddenly people stand say need chip help goodness hearts. prioritization strongly entrenched culture; see time virus even people align progressives left instantly go ""but hurt business owners!"" every time subject public health restrictions comes up. Maybe don’t want zoom? love sister talk everyday rarely zoom - need Australia New Zealand East don’t count. Maybe Israeli govt forcing date sharing different healthcare organisations. Clalit studies well understand market share bigger. 30 years now, chances coming cancer astronomically higher chances coming year. that's true regardless happens vaccine. Remember 1% rise unemployment 37000 deaths result. point harm greater good.

When cases falling daily, point thr saved lives lead WITHOUT update NY, real figure almost certainly larger.   growing community particularly ill-fated subset: long-haulers Covid-19 early March and, testing wasn’t available time, weren’t able promptly get tested Covid-19 antibodies. Without positive confirmation, aren’t eligible treatment clinics Mount Sinai’s Center Post-Covid Care.... Maimonides Medical Center’s Post-Covid Care Center also rejected reason. told every 10 people call, three considered “true patients.” Long-haulers without positive test results also denied experimental drugs starting become available.”

I’m glad hear hospitals opening clinics designed especially long-haulers, it’s heartbreaking think almost 70% denied treatment due lack test absolutely fault own. side coin vaccines look increasingly unnecessary hospitalizations deaths begin crater. People conclude covid basically dead bother. “After 25-minute contact time, nasal spray reduced virus 4.2 1.7 log10 CCID50 per 0.1 mL, statistically significant reduction (P&lt;0.001) 2.5 log10 CCID50.”

It seems study required, perhaps effect peaked 25mins suggesting additional applications maybe required.

Not something I’d want every 25 mins 2-3x times bar restaurant seems reasonable. 1.7 million doses administered today, new record wife teaching entire year person. problem her. guess teachers equal. Wooooooooosh Trump imposes nationwide lockdown February 1 order stop spread virus hit couple states. You’re Andrew Cuomo. Tell response.  it’s anything “Trump trying dictator” you’re absolutely lying. 
Oh downplayed virus.  states health departments thing. wasn’t NCAA started wondering continue conference tournaments people paid attention.  bound happen culture. Time eat garam masala. 306 million go....with double doses purpose lockdowns prevent hospital capacity overwhelmed. young people, hospitalization rate neighborhood 5%-10%. hospital beds available, death rate starts approach hospitalization rate. also additional induced deaths people needed hospitalization reasons longer treated. why, CA example, lockdowns tied ICU capacity. US trial done expected sometime march april [novavax nearly 90% effective 50% South African That’s nice sentiment, virus continues evolutionary trend (more contagious, lethality, elusiveness vaccines immune response) plague continue get worse vaccines won’t stop it. 2% 7 billion 140 million. Ah let feel special. Poor USA tough year. whole stimulus cheque hype US weird IMO. Like sure support unemployed one else needs money. It’s plunging government debt reason. YouTube medical degree gets you. really it’s frustrating us Israelis well part reason lockdowns aren’t lifted high infection rates certain areas. rates aren’t going improve unless people follow rules lockdown get vaccinated. Unfortunately culture following rules, vaccinations really best chance.  US last year estimated ~48 million flu cases span six months, COVID's current IFR would pretty bad. saving grace immune exposure milder disease burden. Even flu mutates previous flu antibodies provide protection, infection severity illness. Bingo! It’s thing stated. pretty much prioritized bunch teacher get vaccine ahead millions others sit home teach computer. swear people sub thrive doom gloom. Honestly people sub worked FDA they'd class vaccine less 90% efficiency useless lool. don’t twitter/Instagram then, lol. called “experts” raging twitter need toss J&amp;J efficacy low. They’ve going days we’re back square one SA variant slightly resistant vaccinations. consider alternative though.

Yeah, like Moderna Pfizer. I'm taking weaker vaccine. got infected left house seen anyone month exporting too

Not anymore. like US. US bad guy according poster. guess don’t trust nature news, world health organization, scientific American difficult problem study, I’m sure formal research studies underway, fact matter people showing sick months later needs properly studied go around claiming “it’s cold bro”. 

Wildly irresponsible misinformative you. Two seconds Googling could found this. think 5.1? seems (not lawyer bs opinion) contract clear ""Initial Europe Doses"" (that is, first 300m) manufacutred ""within EU"" (which 5.1 include UK).

It seems (IANAL) general *within EU* stipulated able guarantee sufficient regulatory oversight (safety, auditing, etc.) used 5.1 such, whereas exact details manufacturing provided 5.4.

As such, I'm sure completely understand reasoning AZ would *not* required use 'UK supply' uphold end contract. Also refer Schedule (p 39) explictly lists UK manufacturing plants manufacture Initial Europe Doses. like politicians sold dreams. It’s great news protection severe disease, doubt edge single shot. still scary long term effects I’m sure fall severe. get mild moderate infection end cognitive deterioration permanent loss smell/taste, right? Curious know protection effects. doubt far better risk death still scary. Good lord. Get together. already much better vaccines. advice probably good situation receive thanks.

If advice causes reader dodge covid, likely even notice. chance notice, reader attribute shaving beard, wearing mask.

The reader notice inconvenience shave observable reason.

This game board precautionary measures especially true demon invisible delayed-incubation virus. American lives state mask mandate, organized plan distribute vaccines, massive amounts people flouting ignoring guidelines, large numbers people still screaming hoax inside stores asked wear mask, others forced work close quarters despite working home feasible, governor gone people attempting report true death toll infection numbers...

.... (x) DOUBT THIS!!!

It's Fauci's job tell best protect you. job tell best protect nation. recommended masks reason recommend vaccine: EXIST!!! that's flu spreads easily. disease that's acceptable. stopped 100% deaths WTF cares??? Let's ship inject ASAP. vaccines set high bar it’s human nature compare them.

With double dose J&amp;J trial going number might get higher anyway.

Now need people board, article local paper week around 50% residents county willing get shot. Ugh. feeling reason sure. shame. data two doses increases efficiency. suggesting give second dose potentially may even help. Great idea. Also means robust data new variants. Pfizer/moderna tested new variants popped up.  J&amp;J testing two shots well. I'm guessing it'll comparable Oxford results. EU repeatedly targeting demanding UK supplies specifically

Because contract explicitly names UK plants delivery EU. was, ramp up.

There troops currently helping testing vaccinating requested next wave.

Fat chance military support request actual medical personnel, whole lot combat troops grunt work supervised techs, nurses, doctors.

Will interesting. Yep exactly. extent splitting hairs. goal completely eliminate every single illness every single person. need eliminate serious outcomes. lived countless viruses decades cold flu things long kill deal it. Yeah rubbish non profit one. mean Communists? prioritized opening schools instead opening bars, could least open schools youngest students, special needs students, etc. nah. chose that. goalposts cannot allowed shift eradication.

Who's that?

Most places hardly locked US, mind would blown continued see drop hospitalizations that's sustained even restrictions gradually lifted. I'm pretty sure referring geography. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article Post viral syndromes always risk everything flu mono. get covid control risk lessened. seem nearly good moderna/pfizer, right? 

Those seem prevent illness 90-95%, says 85% **severe** illness. whats % preventing illness general?  90% population vaccinated fact 30% got J&amp;J irrelevant, risk nearly everyone else’s, honestly won’t much lower 10% unvaccinated.

If 60% vaccinated 30% refusing take J&amp;J want “top shelf” vaccine, 40% total unvaccinated substantially risk community spread much likely.

Speed total vaccination break community spread important margins vaccine effectiveness levels discussing. science, requires public health mindset “I got mine” mindset. Wear mask. Get first available, approved vaccine. Save lives. possible simply analyze level detail, maybe tight time frames on. Moderna info says simply, ""The majority adverse events mild moderate severity"". Almost half Jews Israel Mizrahi, meaning ancestors never left Middle East, large Arab population. culture, food, language etc Middle Eastern. specific reason population South Africa immunity ad26? exposure previous vaccinations? Honestly, would prefer keep quarantining extra six months get better vaccine. young healthy, can't keep quarantining, get vaccine. since I'm perfectly happy work home maintain strict social distancing, want vaccine AZ vaccine. wait doses Pfizer Moderna vaccines available. Yeah good question. talking severe infection like ass week get better vs mild, ass weekend?  They're ongoing - early signs Israel good.

Article continues plan vaccinate teachers first Germany AZ, need change vaccination order that. real chaos here. Israel kicking butt, guess ""Western""? Actually, seems 85% efficient preventing severe good, especially 72% figure. It’s matter distrust. There’s lot anti-vax media spreading around especially Arabic. Initially major part problem Arab population generally younger weren’t eligible we’re seeing hesitance due anti-vax propaganda possibly cultural factors don’t understand. Cool definitely making sure get Pfizer Moderna places lot older populations, social system works. people die way often young people UK ordered 60m doses Anglo-French vaccine referring to.

The US Canada also placed orders.

Also, fail. delayed delivery botch vaccine development.

But thanks chip shoulder France. ""Based PCR performed strains 56 62 cases, efficacy strain calculated 95.6% original COVID-19 strain"" Dude go back kindergarten RELAXED measures Christmas New Years. stupid be? worst timing ever. Sure, whole controversy AZ's predictions time approval. Nobody blames delivered EU far. wouldn’t say marketing ploy. It’s what’s efficient populations may easily able receive 2 doses - homeless people &amp; transient populations, underdeveloped towns/villages, etc. Americans going Mexico get around restrictions US...

Better believe rushing back US get sick though. Australian citizen. currently live Australia. Please come live administrative financial nightmare past 9 months tell I'm lying ""around 50%"" SA variant, around Pfizer Moderna trials. 66% overall 72% US. really matter, though? language contract basically says ""These estimates, we'll give detailed dates later on."" know did, there's also clause contract (which think probably generic), saying ""don't blame us can't deliver there's earthquake nuclear war"" etc, one things lists ""pandemic"" seems bit... snake eating tail, vaccine combat pandemic. worse. people shout scream super bowl Christmas Thanksgiving. least theory. Reasonable efforts. Approximately.

They committed nothing firm.

Anyone thinking company would allow held firm production schedule unknown new facilities completely uneducated business. see, thank you! general public going get vaccinated UK? Tegnell prison yet. No, hold on. Israel slipping Western orbit bit, 1970-2000 Israel solidly western. mean, fucks sake, Israelis immigrants Europe US WWII. Netanyahu really first step away full-on western politics culture really start first term.

Calling Israel Western big stretch.  think 66% chance get full protection, 33% chance get none. like primes body fight disease better would otherwise, good enough 66% people get infection all. rest people likely would severe case without vaccine short case fight better probably also less likely suffer long-term effects result.  Also remember like 49% get annual flu shot US atleast according CDC I'd imagine probably similar rest world. We'll alot 49% taking covid vaccines. Also vaccines likely also include results new strains atleasr robust data regarding new variants read fine print sounds better 66% 72% people throwing around. quote got attention was, ""complete protection COVID-related hospitalization death, 28 days post-vaccination"".

Essentially efficacy varies, effective severe illness, effective time passes shot. right direction, less effective severe illness, efficacy faded time, would good.

And single shot huge. drive-by vaccinations. Overall, AZ 72% effective, J&amp;J 66% effective. picked successful subtrial J&amp;J least successful AZ. 

Actual comparisons are:

- Total AZ 70% vs J&amp;J 66%

- Best subtrial AZ 90% vs J&amp;J 72%

- Worst subtrial AZ 62% vs J&amp;J 57%

Choose one mix match.

As question, I'm expert actual answer, yeah, 30% cases 70% effective vaccine work, makes likely evolve. overall, question whether better limit/stop spread order give virus fewer rolls dice. evolution rolling two dice, imagine virus needs roll two 6's - gets 5 opportunities so. option giving 1 roll, cost needing roll sum 11. get considered actual experts, better understanding dice analogy here, even though even perfect models exact probabilities. Reddit still caught on. guarantee, advocating schools close (or stay closed), come another reason. Next be, new variants. Followed pay. Followed time off. Wow disappointing. Like want much protection possible COVID. Like say COVID cause long term damage even asymptomatic people. could mean even get moderate severe disease, could get scarred God knows long. want simply get ... personal contacts crucial Britain relatively minor player. Trump administration trying snap jabs EU responded vaccine nationalism deciding act bloc counter US’s purchasing power.

This really bugs me. always downside big economy smaller populations. Paying less doses (not there's evidence did) would easily got 5th biggest economy room. Israel similar success.

The uk invested billion research (we put way per capita anyway besides usa), fairly large companies anyway.  EU. US plants working fine. Ok that's fair. say, want less-good vaccine. We've heard months virus causes things like heart inflammation even good number mild cases young healthy people. would much rather never get virus worry long-term repercussions. J&amp;J vaccine still gives people 43% - 28% chance getting virus afterwards. would much rather get vaccine 5% chance infection taking it. Exactly existing. want fairs, concerts, theatre events. know things make people happy. means transmission unchanged 

It address either direction, sure assuming that. Wait prospectus released read able, know early transmission data that.

As aside, whole post really strange. would something clearly improves outcomes, least short term, leave us fucked before? /u/adotmatrix qualified barrister reliable source? started 2 dose trial. sure far along is. think last sentence true. yeah....fuck media two options here. either recover fully die. plenty people experiencing real long term health issues mild infections.  best reasonable effort, defined help much:

1.9. “Best Reasonable Efforts” means (a) case AstraZeneca, activities degree effort company similar size similarly-sized infrastructure similar resources AstraZeneca would undertake use development manufacture Vaccine relevant stage development commercialization regard urgent need Vaccine end global pandemic resulting serious public health issues, restrictions personal freedoms economic impact, across world taking account efficacy safety; 

and (b) case Commission Participating Member States, activities degree effort governments would undertake use supporting contractor development Vaccine regard urgent need Vaccine end global pandemic resulting serious public health issues, restrictions personal freedoms economic impact, across world. US along? short answer is: probably, error bars estimates wide can’t say certainly said before, waves Spain happening holday periods, 2nd wave happened Summer holiday period 3rd wave Christmas holidays. 

We social Spain, strong family ties.

Longer weekends may lead interactions entertaining activities leading infections. Talk louder. think lab quiet obviously never infectious disease lab incredibly loud -80 freezers hood airflow system keeping rooms isolated. Allegedly, AZ shipped EU UK instead storing later EU shipment obliged (EU interpretation contract) ship UK EU make production losses there. all: AZ sold produced priorized customers EU, like bit. Downvoting use ""crush."" ask stupid question... one goes gets vaccine tell getting? ask? beggers can't choosy, I'll go drove 200 miles Moderna one versus 20 miles J&amp;J efficacy rate 30% better. ""distortion"" , understatement century I'm going guess J&amp;J continued two dose testing. guess second dose pumps number match others.

But get first dose start ending pandemic. Boosters follow.

If mRNA ones testing, might find second dose could much later, tested yet, can't really it. yes. knock fever down.

the fever happens body fights.

it's SIGN vax working.

...is good idea suppress fighting? don’t think will. I’m already one dose in, waiting second dose. J&amp;J switch two dose regime well, it’s effective Clickbait headline grounding reality whatsoever.  Shots today Shots summer/fall Perfectly demonstrates current EU mindset. ""If can't it, nobody it"" necessarily. unreliable industry-wide standard function since easier manufacture PCR test kits using require expensive machinery, lot companies manufacturing them, questionable others. ones used Slovakia solid research behind showing almost sensitive PCR tests based results mass testing safe conclude false positives far between, lower tenths percent. use nasal swabs, rapid blood tests significantly less accurate. 

I'm saying effective way preventing spread disease, results quite accurate. yet, sure find out. Unfortunately definitions protocols. won’t call illegitimate. call long emotional appeal anecdote, short data.


And no, saying 1/3rd people report feeling perfect three months combining scariest long-haul anecdote available count meaningful data Putting one place increases risk them. Putting place increases risk community.

Pretty simple me.

Maybe travel bullshit reasons.  politics kind disgusting EU's part. hey, never let crisis go waste. They're delivering promised, temporary delay overall increase supply Can't Canada manufacture like Australia? deck kind stacked one shot vaccines based measure results.

If two recipients - one gets one shot JnJ vaccine, one gets first shot Pfizer, come Covid 15 days shot - well, JnJ recipient gets counted case. Pfizer one (basically - number reported, focused on). Don’t see uncertainty is, least States.

We’ve secured enough vaccine include J&amp;J Novavax nearly everyone country end June.

AZ coming well.

All around 100% effective preventing hospitalizations.

We restrictions place protect hospitals.

Full stop. Luckily Pfizer said looking exceeding EU deliveries large amount. Pfizer hit export restrictions unless something changes. J&amp;J produced EU too, hopefully better AZ too. 20% reduction lot reasonable 60% 75% reduction. think may able look Phase I/II data that. Florian Krammer's Nature article summarizes candidates J&amp;J published know enough say whether numbers equivalent titers second Novavax. literally quoted part saying exist Completely lost interest whole thing, time stopped hyping virus up, stopped talking it, stopped treating sort existential threat.

There pretty marked step efficacy variant though honestly, hospitalizations/deaths that's big deal. also single dose, easing distribution logistics. Except offered Honda Civic Lexus free, one would get? think sounds like exactly Biden's plan is. made hopeful remark US ""herd immunity"" summer. people able like, mostly 2019 familiar summer 2021, he'd one popular Presidents recent history.  


 think got early sneak peek data made remark. think everone confusing severe illness severe infection. One infected without illness. guessing here, imagine ""severe infection"" defined high viral loads. see actual paper published though. No. wherever else want probably trials around this, believe too. take long time though meantime stick 1 shot (which also way faster roll reaches twice many people). That's mild infections pre-immunity though. mild infection pre-immunitynof level probably less chance kinds things body ramps defenses viral load gets high trigger control immune responses. living nothing look forward too. 

Exactly. never realized much use looking forward things get days.

I'm used hard work. I'm used stress. I'm used sacrifice. whole level. nothing look forward to, slog life? slog tomorrow? Why? ask lot.

I know intrinsically things get 'better' - lack positive messaging making feel like long time (years). maybe we'll right back 5 years anyway, whenever next virus comes around. Probably they/their doctor didn’t think needed to. happens time real life. Nobody wants go hospital. &amp;#x200B;

Also doctors, given aunt even uncles health issues (the poor guy giant open hole side body another lung issue), could say they’re working ensure aunt uncle vaccinated site best vaccine.

They haven’t able really leave house damn near year now. getting shots early-mid February people acting great hoped? whole point lockdown overrun hospital healthcare system. nearly eliminates necessity. never intention destroy virus, control it. fantastic news. it’s lmfao, people preference. dominant strains arrive US, J&amp;J could become ineffective whatsoever. plus 2 doses looks much effective one pretty good article (in Spanish) it:  Yh one. remember seeing tweet journalist question saying provide sources evidence anonymity seems convenient me. Germany come next day say 8% efficiency simply true? believe lol  true, schedule makes clear little AZ vaccines countries expect. deliveries summer seems like “best effort” like effort all. really. acting right free illness. isn't. Yas kween!!! not. must read contract whole parts it. clearly never endured holiday drunken family.  Try Canadian. We're getting vaccines now. like 200k month Moderna Pfizer banned exporting anything EU. find watching Haikyuu helps

Just started finally, great People two boxes news:

1) everything stays exactly like forever 

2) everything fine exactly back pre-2020 within months 

Globally, neither outcomes likely. developed nations, trending toward lot closer 2 1, still uncertainty Actually 5.4 explicitly mentions UK sites relevant section only. means initial doses made using EU sites UK sites later date. Actually.

Right, AZ tried build capacity elsewhere problems like UK difference Government helped ready facilities know, spent ensure supply chain robust. acted quickly, unsurprisingly better position EU EU desperate excuses.

They 'export' anything, AZ used capacity HALIX Netherlands produce 500k doses UK early December. promised 4 million. almost like delays effecting everyone acted quicker better position. Shocking. would like subscribe newsletter. first group healthcare workers healthcare workers ""doctors."" 

My husband works residential group home. employees little education. Many immigrants mixed bag views vaccinations. He's worked staff house, really like trust him, \*everyone\* getting vaccinated. company-wide, rate 30%. 

Yes, 70% people could get vaccination right free, likely exposed COVID pass around vulnerable people deciding get vaccine.  I've blocked many subreddits. Fightporn, funny, blood pressure dropped Forcing people work living raging pandemic rediculous. Thankfully Biden agreed.

It's UBI good enough now.  provide novel analysis. unwilling certainly suggests wrong. Reading clauses also suggests wrong It’s completely reasonable feel protected get vaccine significantly less effective others. Quite literally won’t protected. mean,  think there's middle ground two positions. 500k folks dead US hospital staff pushed brink makes feel concern warranted extent. fatalism never going away probably taking far. imagine midway year, sooner, turning point. Sounds like would expected recover would put way: two plants EU. committed 80M doses first quarter. a) learned one plant (undisclosed) issues b) said would deliver 40% ""best effort"" commitment. scenario, giving 4M (5% commitment) doses UK, explicit contractual agreement, definitely cannot considered ""best effort"". also questionable whether announced 40% would ""best effort"", even one plant failed completely, one would still expect 50%. plant must produced time probably fail completely. 

So all, looks like AZ gets money selling vaccine others instead stockpiling EU. Maybe incident factory, maybe wasn't, case AZ looks faulty here. 

To reconfirm, yes EU negotiate particularly smart. Yes, Uschi v.d.L. bad history comes public logistics acquisitions. contract, AZ committed stockpile certain amount vaccine simply that.  Yeah, really hope let perfect enemy good here. Scaling mRNA vaccine manufacturing take time have, vaccine beats thought possible year ago. add people saying, Palestinians East Jerusalem vaccinated access healthcare services Israeli citizen. Something Israel responsible healthcare East Jerusalem areas Palestine. state, he's possibly eligible asthma, high blood pressure, diabetes quite conditions. I'm younger two conditions mean able get appointment. staying open year forcing us work mandatory overtime factory give yearly fifty cent raise. Here's ""essential workers"" essential making company money! literally says ""for purpose 5.4 includes UK"". explicitly says EU 5.1 include UK. seems EU three options point:

1) wind neck try best work AZ get production full capacity ASAP.

2) Lawyer spend christ knows long trying argue AZ breach contract, point probably caught production anyway.

3) Throw weight around attempt get AZ renege contracts nations order fulfil order. plagues, worst infectious killers humanity, bacterial. Bacteria may infectious spread rapidly means hosts, food, etc... part reason I'm finding pandemic exhausting. Nobody knows feel consistent messaging. Everyone's emotions warped sensationalist media.

I also realize is, indeed, serious. 400k+ deaths frightening. suspect location may play large role vaccine available. I’d assume J&amp;J vaccine pushed rural communities may lack ability store 2-dose varieties require cold temperatures. seems large urban areas administering vaccine hospitals mass centers, harder rural areas. Anecdotal girlfriends grandmother going die cancer would completely treatable caught diagnosed early. started growth lip, underneath mask, even though son went see frequently never saw growth always wore mask. time got hospital, uncontrollable she’s ICU weeks tore face apart. survives, never anywhere near normal again. many thousands millions others didn’t get care needed covid? third richest country world

Out curiosity, using GDP (nominal) metric? know vaccine prevents long term health issues seen pop though even asymptomatic cases think fantastic start. J&amp;J also running 2-shot regiment study basically add booster shot line would presumably boost efficacy way up. apply EUA shot now, give younger, lower risk people likely mount strong immune response curb amount virus circulating. go back give second shot data shows good idea. No, will. sat papers two weeks waited late afternoon friday approve damn vaccine audacity moaning company lacks urgency.

And now, still approved.  comments social media regarding J&amp;J vaccine insane.

Think back March 2020, told 11 months we'll vaccine 70% effective, meaning effective flu vaccine, pretty much eliminates risk hospitalized, we'd elated.

I really hope people influence large voice social media put perspective.

Every vaccine stick, sticks easier bludgeon fucking virus. course. mind isolation. efficacy numbers seem consistent findings. quote [the J&amp;J press vaccine candidate 85 percent effective preventing severe disease across regions studied, [i] 28 days vaccination adults 18 years older. Efficacy severe disease increased time cases vaccinated participants reported day Janssen COVID-19 vaccine candidate demonstrated complete protection COVID-related hospitalization death, 28 days post-vaccination. clear effect vaccine COVID-19 cases requiring medical intervention (hospitalization, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)), reported cases among participants received Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, 28 days post-vaccination.

It also appears effective severe outcomes, effective time passes shot. think they're sandbagging little 66% 72%. need referral family doctor usually means either you’re symptomatic exposed recently. reason think although I’m certain we’ve issues extremely crowded testing centers led new infections. 
I would willing bet family doctors going give referral anyways even don’t reason believe exposed high test positivity rate been. could encouraging masks hospital grade. seemed like genuine belief people without symptoms wearing masks would impact. 66% average efficacy, including variants. also 100% effective preventing hospitalizations, meaning seriously cut severity disease point stops public health threat. news great.

This well bar would consider effective, game changing vaccine. 10 months ago, news would cause celebration. 

90% vaccines minimum standard, far crazy use benchmark everything else. J&amp;J 100% effective stopping hospitalizations across VARIANTS.

I literally don’t care get sick don’t go hospital bc hypochondriac. 

You’re saying me... go hospital COVID get shot??

I say you... “STICK ARM!”

And “OPEN FUCK UP!” true also whether prevent least shorten time people transmit virus. know requested redaction, could well AZ. 66% effective preventing moderate/severe covid?! way- want 90%+ preventing covid. seriously hope get access Pfizer Moderna. Oh wasn’t aware that, links? 
Can't find now, sorry :/ look later, like saying things source AFAIK, regulators like MHRA still receiving data trials constant basis. (Forgive ignorance this) matter data public long right people receiving it? 


It's important, preliminary results widely criticized patients right make informed decision vaccines.  Spanish understand this. infections happen outside working places. (Exception Health Care professionals). Many people, specially younger people still like socialise friends relatives despite pandemic situation.

If reduce working days, infections may increase rather decrease. Oh yeah. And, always confident cocky opinion. 66% efficacy based moderate severe cases covid-19, excluding mild mild cases. exclusion milder cases tends make headline efficacy statistic look better, trials place kinds cases use determine efficacy. seems J&amp;J efficacy actually much worse Sinovac's inactivated virus vaccine (which drew criticism 51% efficacy, inclusion mild mild cases). Germany already it, worked. What's debate?  wouldn’t trust still. It’s country doctors researchers risk consequences based say. rational fear many people follow reasoning hence endangering vaccination campaign. worries  puts slightly behind sinovac candidate terms effectiveness severe illness, one redditors gleefully attacked weeks ago. literally thing care about. could get COVID really become ""just flu bro"" even less severe, we've won. many people dying COVID diseases, hospitals full. give relief.

I received Sinopharm jab, even though know may protect getting COVID. know, sure, severe case. flu spreads easlily people dont actually get flu shots. Well yeah. Severe laid bed week two need go hospital.

This vaccine seems better preventing serious outcomes really need. I'm far interested preventing hospitalizations preventing mild cases. supposed make difference? AZ asking released, like released EU contract forced ugly row. 13.1 (e) certainly fraudulent misrepresentation part AZ, given EU reasonable expectation UK sites would usable manufacturing Initial Doses, whereas fact AZ knew not. like that, went jogging finish line sprinting. get thing ASAP, see us back normal mid-late spring. I’m fucking happy right now. Exactly. Maybe give young people access vaccine first... people less likely get super sick anyway spreading Covid WITHOUT vaccine right now, speak Wonderful gives hope thank where? still blind, really crystal clear:

There extra section whose purpose define manufacturing sites.

5.4 Manufacturing SitesAstraZeneca shall use Best Reasonable Efforts manufacture Vaccine manufacturing sites located EU (**which, purpose section 5.4 shall include United Kingdom**) may manufacture Vaccine non-EU facilities, appropriate, accelerate supply Vaccine Europe...

So whenever contract says EU connection manufacturing sites, **includes United Kingdom.** Yes, **even section 5.1** well right lot people wearing simple cloth masks bandanas never effective begin with. virus variants transmissible means they're even less effective. Well aware shortcomings American media, disagree assertion seeing anti-zionism point anti semitism anti-zionism inherently anti-semitism. denial right Jewish people self-determination least part historical land anti-Semitism. happens 15%? need referral get tested? Meaning people symptomatic getting tested? Basically idea whether people vaccinated would would test positive get tested. 

It’s really misleading many people reading this. People getting vaccinated obviously getting sick. That’s good. Bust based you’re saying, they’re also refraining testing anyone asymptomatic, don’t know *anything* many vaccinated people might carrying spreading virus without showing symptoms. ex-worker fits description. measles vaccine 95% 1 shot 99% 2 shots. disease crazy, need 90% herd immunity prevent outbreaks. think R value like 13-16 something. Yes, love it. can’t directly compare two. study took place later time regions different variants disease. 

“But much debate next weeks likely best use vaccine different efficacy profile easier logistics. Experts warned clinical trial results can’t directly compared, differences trials designed conducted. anticipate people anyway.”

It may well good Pfizer Moderna even quite, it’s still plenty good huge help. one got shot hospitalized. job, please don’t take masks away won’t able work safely! percent control caught it?  make first place mother Europe crazy Right dispute AZ EU, UK following contract AZ vaccine plants UK. 

It's perfectly fine EU want block exports AZ vaccine EU debate may broken contract EU. know we'll wait see. course EU want prioritise order AZ vaccine EU plants, that's perfectly fine. UK exact same.

However, discussed EU blocking Pfizer vaccines despite Pfizer holding end bargain EU. Pfizer broken deliveries promise EU yet EU talking blocking vaccine exports make lack AZ vaccine. referring Moderna right? 
I think 18-55 yo cohort, could mistaken

The could true J&amp;J cohort, dont access data make determination  living lives completely normal New Zealand Hybrid great theory shitty practice. students faint facsimile school, far removed ""real school"" barely worth it. can't eat go home mask requirements (which legit) barely cool activities many home remotely. hard activity students way online/in person. can't group work person either social distancing. fucking mess. Scaling number vaccines done based population US, using figure directly compare Canadian population wrong.  Yeah don’t bother flu shot got covid vaccine first one still waiting second. Seeing news reports people suffering long term damage mean common. US alone 26m official cases. Although considering many cases missed back March/April last year could looking double that. Remember 20-30k cases back March clearly massive undercount say 50m cases include tested back even we're still missing cases(not everyone gets tested). many roughly 50m cases hospitalised suffered long term damage.  course alternative, mean however accept might way queue sit home way longer. “Best reasonable efforts.” agree deliver amount contractually. 

It’s pretty obvious many people contracting experience Reddit. Well

1) it’s foolish assume moderna Pfizer hit numbers. already struggling AstraZeneca fiasco warning.

2) weeks matters, lives saved

3) importantly **once broad level immunization breaks community transmission exact level protection doesn’t matter**

The *actual* defense virus, since whole classes people can’t get vaccine (you know, like everyone 18 moment) breaking epidemic stopping community transmission. That’s meant “herd immunity”. Reaching herd immunity levels important individuals vaccine efficacy. Awesome. That's really matters end. workers heavily unionized. rise variants critical crush covid asap. FDA needs working around clock authorize Novavax, J&amp;J Astrazeneca. understanding surface transmission relatively rare, easy thing people mindful anyway, handwashing really level masks distancing. Children *absolutely* risk flu, *definitely do* give flu shots.

Source: biomedical researcher two young children 10 million living Sweden. Everyone's life matters, covid-susceptible. Oh, Wisconsin numbers support repealing mask mandate. Also open.  even debate? Yes course 5.1 says ""manufactured within EU"". seems pretty clear IANAL either. Scheule seem binding, estimate attached contract. Interesting paragraph Washington post version article: “But much debate next weeks likely best use vaccine different efficacy profile easier logistics. Experts warned clinical trial results can’t directly compared, differences trials designed conducted. anticipate people anyway.” data taken relatively shortly immunisation vaccine. could people vaccine still caught COVID complete immune response still. take time point later, would expect people build immune response. really Western that's counted? 
I mean even UAE well Eastern countries dont count? get downvoted hell every time say one people. flu probably 30 years flu shot maybe twice. problem trying predict strains flu put shot region apparently really hard. completely different ballgame Covid vaccine. little confused too. actually give definition severe press release. study, definition severe COVID-19 disease included laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 one following: signs consistent severe systemic illness, admission intensive care unit, respiratory failure, shock, organ failure death, among factors. 

Not sure would symptoms go hospital, unless severe symptoms lasted short time, guess would also good news. It’s ridiculous Sweden simultaneously everybody else accusing countries dystopian. Tegnell claiming goal strategies Sweden unique rest world gone mad. 

This truly Schroedingers strategy. It’s weaker newer strains. Vaccine 2.0 going developed. said, old vaccine technology vaccine. happy got 66% bar 50%. get temporary Calvary start inoculating people. Today good day. Gotta ask...do even open windows? Stick directly neck. They're conducting study right confirm that.

The quicker able inoculate effective vaccines, faster pandemic comes end. Thank everyone else taking part trials!!! might little soon make prediction bet EU eventually get rolling vaccinations US stagnate areas reach immunity around time People need understand ""Severe"" means. severe mean short breath/have low oxygen levels. severe mean perceive horrible time virus. Cheaper produce, easier rollout... sacrifice important element: efficacy 😃 Novavax vaccine facing similar hurdles. It’s 95.6% effective original strain, 60% effective SA strain.

These strains concerning. Luckily, Novavax CEO said yesterday working SA variant booster. Yes!

Every case isn’t it’s little tragedy.

Flood market J&amp;J, AZ Novavax, give Pfizer Moderna old risk eventually everyone too... let’s go party give cold whatever hell want give hospitals break. Europe Q1 bit slow, Q2 receive massive dump vaccines, practically finished vaccinating. beginning Q3 last couple vaccines delivered used EU. problem just: EU able vaccinate doses come in? EU vaccinate around 5,5 million people per day Q2 want keep supply. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Tweets mean fuck 60% effective = flu vaccine! Sign up! 

Also, hot take. really matter since best vaccines given olds currently going happen get vaccine can: require booster variants can't wait actually movies theaters again. lol

Got shot week ago, looked going movies next week miss popcorn... absolute jack shit playing. AZ says different. Let battle commence waste time resources could spent something useful vaccine already freely available anyone wants manufacture it, provided cost.

I guess could want massively fall Pfizer J&amp;J etc too. probably best bet countries get vast portfolio vaccine. Get whatever becomes available first try get mRNA ones. course exposed safely virus vaccine much better nothing.

But thing understand countries(like Canada) invest mRNA vaccines. Especially Canada. fiscal power industrial might so(not currently could go private companies develop this). government seem understand this.

Because COVID flu acceptable imo shot 50-70ish percent effective. Like get flu people bad end world. COVID much nastier. cause damage almost every organ body ranging brain lungs. add, actually one dose oxford seems provide slightly better protection J&amp;J measured roughly time

My question would whether time frame studies responsible difference. Oxford's phase 3 trials run new strains (such South Africa) commonplace? Less though, UK vulnerable population vaccinated next weeks, EU even first target many months away. Deaths per day UK almost zero thousands EU. Boris deny vaccines might shared phase 1 asked yesterday doses would go EU. many factors play. strains influenza also far less infectious SARS-CoV2, herd immunity would reached way lower proportion population vaccinated  Lmao swear good thing lot work FDA EMA otherwise class vaccine that's less 90% efficient useless worth approving even though scientists would disagree you. annual flu shot 40-60% efficient yet 49% US still happily take helps even though probably think annual flu shot useless since less 90% efficient. FDA said anything 50% efficiency acceptable. Trials also showed 85% efficient preventing severe [illness ](http://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-johnson-johnsons-single-shot-vaccine-85-effective-against-most-severe-symptoms-12202200). Also one needed go hospital. win book. vaccine keeps us hospital that's major win. takes severe pressure hospitals. Meaning even still developed covid symptoms taking vaccine would still prevent going hospital. 

Also exactly know efficient pfizer/moderna new variants. know still work totally sure whether reduces efficiency slightly. Hence Moderna looking third booster shot boost efficiency new [variants Problem cloth masks much. I'd recommend kn95 bandana it. keep safer probably made promises knew keep.

Why would that? even making profit this. mean way likely there’s 2 people strain, two first found. 1 person possibly change minds millions. think spare it... Thank commenting. would venture say even less damaging flu, since flu still kills tens thousands every year hospitalizes hundreds thousands (except flu season, oddly enough) America. live northeast it’s 20 degrees today. can’t go gym, either, would normally due stay sane cold, dark days. SUPER careful 4 people high risk different issues.

That's exactly get vaccinated. can't understand hesitancy greatest fear covid would might give loved one dies. would hard live with. Oh, I've already received first dose Moderna I'm quite happy. option would Pfizer. also would gladly taken. Pretty shitty. Think pass Exactly. guess cases hanging home clots low oxygen.... count though covid crushed first? following news closely recently. studies show likely Moderna/Pfizer vaccines stop spread virus? testing hit participating schools, total 54 130 attendees tested (41.5%), 38 positive cases came back.

That's high attack rate. Given likely age distribution participants, I'd guess untested many mild cases well. I'm even bothering click document. I'm lawyer I'm well aware interpretation contract useless. kinda amazing many people relevant expertise happily read share strongly worded opinion document.

I await actual lawyers experts say. Leave 'murica make shit show competition. Grats millions people dead, many lives affected, crushed health care workers. winning shit lottery! No, part Australian subcontinent. BS Tom Cruise got camera feel better vaccine. anyone paid play make believe. know demographics data participants death bad outcome disease, frankly unlikely compared bad effects, longterm, even primary concern elderly already vaccines lined up. 85% prevention severe cases, 66% ""offers complete protection severe covid 19 disease""

Articles

""Disappointing one dose shot news""

I'm confused. Help. Plus, reported efficacy severe covid19 100%. SA variant makes nervous enough want one protection. hoping people risk given choice. No, otherwise best effort mean anything. folks pretty tech savvy age still needed help figure system getting appointment. state doesn’t central system signing up, submit like 50 different forms different pharmacies county find something. lucky able get first day expansion announced 65+ literally zero appointments found hadn’t helping probably would’ve wait weeks months get system. Wait covid?  57% S.A. bit concerning part.

Especially since easy J&amp;J put booster shot mRNA vaccines. Agreed. think ""end summer / early fall"" Fauci timeline based current vaccines approved. I'm fine indoor masking long anyone wants it, outdoor masking situations needs go. never good science behind except large gatherings. Insane western vaccine nationalists attacked sinovac vaccine better effectiveness J&amp;J candidate. rookie numbers, gotta pump numbers honestly think needs even effective. 66% effective preventing people catching covid, also prevented 85% severe infections 100% hospitalizations deaths. That's good enough end pandemic. fact you’re downvoted person said “people many friends it’s good cut out” speaks volumes level sociopathic loser populates sub. commitment ""best effort"". UK went teething problems 3 months prior, EU's teething problems they're probably gaining knowledge UK paid for.

EU looking pretty shit rn 85% effective preventing severe cases  Hey hey hey, least arguing something actually written instead something coming mouth politicians CEO :) hope get choose. I'll say this: anything better nothing. miss opportunity get vaccinated. said, course choice... data efficacy hospitalization / severe illness SA strain? Pretty much Fauci said.

""You know problem is? Moderna 94-95% .... would said wow, 72% effective vaccine that's even effective severe disease really terrific,"" said telephone interview.

""But we're always judging 94 95%. said that, vaccine could use particularly developing countries keep people hospital. good efficacy severe disease,"" Fauci added. know, learned yesterday. effective flu vaccine effective rate 60%?

Most years, flu vaccine somewhere 10%-55%. 

Just put things perspective..... live USA title seem even remotely possible. Pfizer/Moderna anyone 50 older, underlying conditions 
AZ/Novavax/J&amp;J anyone 49 younger Well doesn’t seem good... “While Eurocrats sought blame AstraZeneca alleged favouring UK customer, company’s CEO revealed UK contract place three months bloc, implied Brussels bureaucracy blame lack progress successful vaccine production.” can't really wait mrna flu, also long worked universal flu maybe even universal coronavirus

We overdue jump vaccine technology Early March EUA April adults US states eligible looks right.

March-June huge vaccination months.

Normal summer come! Can. TO.

Those sites capacity fulfilling orders. Anyone underselling J&amp;J efficacy insane.

72% doesn’t look like good number first, especially it’s two 95% effective vaccines. thing 100% effective stopping cases requiring hospitalization - even different variants. HUGE. means pandemic worse flu short months. Johnson Johnson vaccine shoot USA rapidly. getting fuckload quickly. I'm curious definition ""Western"", ""Crush"", ""First"" article laughably false.

Like Western, mean US, France, Germany western culture? Crush mean really pump infection rates record highs? First, mean, know, top 50%? Exactly, can't even send kids school severe chronic illness risky cant get vaccine elderly healthcare workers, grocery store workers get them. husband still works high risk job military cant get vaccine Im early 30s, grandmas roommate nursing home got last week died natural causes 98. kids need school, daughter autism adhd needs services cancelled notice. frustrating. love wasting time, I've got enogh. there, need argue. read it. 

It's really crystal clear. 5.4 defines ""EU"" 5.1 means, ""EU"" 5.1 means including UK. zero doubt. 

But let's stop here, repeat cycle reach theoretical reddit limit. Seriously get help stop consuming many news. 0,2% chance those. terrible mono corona even became thing long time brain fog fatigue. permanent. know two different viruses 99% time long time effects going go away soon. 
Seriously trying downplay covid bad media portrays it. Fair enough It’s right wait get best vaccine can. also continue restrictions accommodate people make decision. people can't afford masks forcing everyone wear lowest common denominator pandemic last longer poor become poorer answer. Preventing transmission would mean cases start dropping much faster

It may huge, means unvaccinated people would probably risk months longer. They're getting microchip thing lack clear detail conveyed. I've learned many, all, vaccine doses vials microchipped order track dose is, used, vaccine stats like that.

Surgical masks, 1 2, anywhere near hard talk full face mask PAPR, number relevant. Since low efficacy, people get much likely get covid. new mild cases also run risk long covid (heart problems, reduced lung capacity, etc.)?

They’re working booster shots fix problem, though. basics before, far fewer people covid, one person covid wearing mask leaving lot virus around (which whole point masks). risk transmission low enough rest us, even without masks on, probably get it. home made masks reduce trail virus infected offered ton protection otherwise.

NOW, lot people covid even masks, viral load public places going up. Enough risk transmission lot higher point rest us need really protect ourselves. like pre-mask days covid positive people shedding tons virus spreading fast, tons virus many people shedding little. actually amazing tbh. One year ago we're stuck dark vaccines horizon. year later several effective vaccines. Science truly amazing guess I'm wondering main stream. Nurses probably never asked company vaccine covid.

Interesting times.

J&amp;J: add player shoots 65% three point range, 85% jump-shot range. Still significantly better average, good 95% guy; would want player team? course would. done months ago... UK getting first 60 million doses, first sign contract many months ago. Yes. don’t care. Tired hearing certain communities feeling slighted they’re ones avoiding vaccine first place. Science truly amazing. year ago zero covid vaccines several effective vaccines. penetrate vaccine baby Thanks source. think next years lawyers debating 1.9 (a). Ah nice! med student (and coincidentally also anesthesiology gunner want exclusively practice clinically), nice hear :) take opposite approach. Old people need worry feeling tired bed ridden cause that's kind hobby, long die, that's perfect vax them.  already received first dose exactly? Like anyone would consider switching J&amp;J second shot? No, want reach goddamned reddit limit! going severe bottlenecks production want produce mRNA vaccines.

Oxford J&amp;J use totally different technology different supply constraints, going lot easier make RNA adenovirus vaccine make RNA vaccines. new Zealand beaten quite months. Australia far behind them. US looong way go yet.

Seriously, hell talking to? American people? US government? Asian Times authored article? random stick lodged butt? Theoretically pump shot people's arms give another one later to? booster MRNA one? Flu completely different ball game, though.

Sorry say we’re headed towards world we’re hyper vigilant unvaccinated. People aren’t going continue years it’s becoming obvious covid isn’t going away entirely. It’s headed towards flu level disease. I'd assume mRNA vaccine manufacturers pumping much stuff can. US ordered 600,000,000 doses vaccines, expect hand early summer. That's enough vaccinate entire adult population. could see J&amp;J shot administered soon available curb pandemic much possible winter months, two shot mRNA vaccine administered spring/summer anyone wants greater protection offered.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Flu vaccines like vaccine, though. Here's one quote found subject still got flu vaccinated were 37% less likely hospitalized and were 23% protected from serious outcome like ICU admission death. Pregnant women flu who’d flu shot also 40% less likely hospitalized. 2017 study, otherwise healthy children hospitalized flu were 65% less likely die if they’d flu vaccine.

So I'm reading correctly, get flu symptoms getting flu vaccine, 23% 65% less likely sort severe outcome vs unvaccinated individuals.

And that's _on top_ however effective particular flu vaccine preventing mild symptoms.

A product like J&amp;J's vaccine even better, stopping 85% severe cases 100% deaths trial. That's fantastic outcome.

There's reason get flu shot every year, reason think giving lower-risk groups bad idea. use MRNA vaccines older / high risk individuals ramp slightly less effective vaccines quickly lower-risk population.  decided judges though, tend lawyers case missed :P kept normal 2-8 it’s one dose People focus vaccination want resolve whole covid issue personally. Viewing tiny part giant effort drive numbers reduce risk everyone realistic less satisfying. specific case, testing symptoms, also testing asymptomatic infections. assessment quite true. 

Being exposed virus mean infected. infected means virus take hold. Covid-19, possible infected without showing symptoms - fact happens 50% time, even without vaccine. whole point vaccine prevent symptoms, equip ones body ones immune system shuts chance take hold. Yeah, #1 priority maximizing shots arms. Age decent proxy COVID risk, easy verify, good prioritization mechanism. Certainly perfect terms equity, logistically appealing. am. Currently hold 28minutes. Wrote post waiting. 

Just trying different options, ya know? Lawyers analysis LBC exactly that. EU leg stand on. Ya prevents hospitalizations probably prevents too. birx &amp; fauci suggested goggles faceshield along mask back july: Also, remaining people get flu shots choice choosing get effective, because, them, simple decision.

Behavioral economics experiments shown complicated decision seems, likely person choose go along whatever default is.

So, example, doctors automatically scheduled flu shots patients every year, we'd much better off. JJ 100% effective death severe hospitalization. That’s good news way spin it. Remember 8% efficacy according German government source? Good times. I'm sure half sub immediately swallowed fact learned nothing, life. uk? vaccinating fast. threatening take UK supplies

Is nowhere contract something inherently different compared allow export controls increase transparency. Cases surged UK left lockdown start December. Xmas risky moved onto ineffective tier system prior xmas.

If Tier system effective, xmas would nowhere near risky was. Surgeons double mask. One soft mask one hard mask.  That's still national mask mandate. Maybe stop naming virus strains countries, less xenophobia politics...Just strain sequenced UK doesn’t mean originated anyway Another factor viral load. high enough load, amount immunity going prevent cells invaded. 

However, important note aim vaccination, total immunity. Depending infection rate, around 70% immunity would enough snuff virus out. vaccines definitely outperforming expections. know common side effects are. saw reports 30% young college athletes heart inflammation even mild cases. seems concerning. 
Some people able get better vaccine others....I want one ones protective.
Getting 95% effective vaccine would take lot worry stress life. 
Getting 65% effective vaccine....I would probably still walk around afraid get near people. 
I want able live without fear. think J&amp;J vaccine would give situation. Amazing see gets upvoted days. people really losing minds. multiple studies including one released week CDC proves children drivers community infection. contract much lower rate , symptomatic infection much lower rate spread infection much lower rate. 

It truly sad educators failed educate themselves. Palestinians... oh right Israel won’t give Covid affects primarily elderly pre-existing conditions. ran unchecked years, would probably kill significant % people. However, remaining people would immunity time became elderly would immune. virus would eventually burn out.  applies whole contract. purpose clarify uncertainties manufacturing sites. Whenever ""EU"" mentioned contract respect manufacturing sites, includes UK. naive think politicians use science-related topics push politics. do. Right. Oxford main contender lot countries due cost ease transport. 

Guess what's better protecting 20 population 95% corona? Protecting 80% 66% downgrading symptoms common cold get it. Yeah! news positive reason once. Seriously. get AZ hesitancy since data bit messy whatever, approving important stopping spread varients slowing creation new varients. Novavax tested multiple regions various economic ethnic backgrounds see need US-specific data emergency. people already dead?  Yes sure variants already widespread, look mean exist.

I also theory areas sudden outbreaks despite lockdowns like California actually acquired one variants, spread nothing lockdowns everything variants.

This completely consistent viruses spread widely, mutate spread. Shots shots shots shots shots shots shots shots shots shots shots... everybody totally agree. Shallow interactions people really know something miss. I'm sad can't go see elderly aunt uncle person. I'm sad can't hug best friends. I'm sad family probably able see baby born summer. really care see grocery store employees curbside pickup now. Yeah, medical personnel doesnt seem issue, least administering shots. Ive talked nurses said they'd happy administer vaccines days. also use nursing students well. cycle patients incredibly fast. go questionnaire inject. takes couple minutes.

Where military really help putting together mass vaccination sites logistics behind it. It'll interesting see unfolds. There's much behind scenes goes unseen general public. compare EU countries...nope, horrible.  So.... rather protection instead protection. Countries like India needs help countries badly needs see light! That's time help countries US lagging vaccine acquisition even help us much. Wow, that's unreal.

I live Nova Scotia Canada, average like probably 2-3 cases per day point unmasked people (indoors) far within. Well least made use vaccines. Good them. Makes sense. 
J&amp;J trials South Africa Brazil. two variants probably dipped efficacy. Astrazeneca. 
Novavax issue. Worked wonders UK variant. suffered miserably South African variant. I'm sorry, say something?...hello....are there? 
Click... right. think mean vaccine didn’t create sufficient antibodies inactivate virus. know severity disease dependent viral load it’s successful replication body. time, non-vaccinated person, it’s race generate antibodies virus get body. respond differently immune system gets altered primed different rates. slower immune response results higher severity. 
For JJ vaccine, antibody titers may completely eliminate virus present body enough levels give good head start. may fall sick, severe reaction. 

I better vaccine. get regular flu vaccine settle something second rate? Millions? Really? Millions black people suddenly believe science Tyler Perry says so? Give break. case EU (that primarily high risk people get flu shots)? Almost everyone know US gets flu shot- although fair, work pharma healthcare. also supply chemicals pfizer vaccine.   fact one dose, makes twice easy administer vaccines. would surprise huge manufacture benefits need make less liquid fill fewer vials. think vaccins given young healthy first. ones spreading more.

## people respond updated vaccines they’ve already immunized?

Researchers don’t yet know person fully vaccinated first-generation COVID vaccine respond fresh vaccine new variant. Immunologists long observed people tend mount robust immune responses first variant pathogen encounter subsequent variants. phenomenon could mean updated vaccines might trigger muted immune responses first vaccine. “The fear boosting somebody variant won’t make new response variant,” says Weissman. “It’ll boost old response.”

But Weissman argues evidence RNA vaccines may fall prey trend. reasons clear, RNA vaccines trigger surprisingly complex immune responses, yielding antibodies target regions viral proteins often undetected responses kinds vaccines. could mean RNA vaccines also better able target changes present variant, Weissman says.

And Offit notes variant-specific response may necessary: even updated vaccine mainly boosts response earlier coronavirus vaccine, may still enough fend variants, says. Prevents 100% hospitalization. difference US transparent let everyone know last summer. EU scoffed said vaccine exported globally, countries(like Canada) made EU contracts. now, warning, vaccine available EU might block promised countries like Canada. means less chance catching Covid using public transportation Federal property. Vaccines end pandemic instead. sure live, think reasons optimistic: 
1. J&amp;J also trial two-dose course. get J&amp;J shot now, likely able get second shot boost effectiveness line.

2. can't say certain, would surprising find vaccine also reduce chances long-term complications like brain fog lung damage. 

3. option wait little while, probably able get mRNA vaccine old/at-risk people country vaccinated it. Especially happen live US: US ordered enough mRNA vaccine every adult US, some. first show almost week ago. note always get mild allergic reaction flu shot take Claratin morning shot. side effects. Runny nose, sore arm chills first days. However, MILD. felt like body fighting something-which want happen.

I probably get worse reaction next dose still safer getting COVID. Please panic side effects. small price pay protection. I'm sure data comes coming years, vaccines even safer. anyone remembers early flu shots people side effects week routine shot. 100% severe disease 49 days greater.

I feel like able relax J&amp;J one. I'd still afraid near people. 

But got 95% effective vaccine would take lot stress worry life. I'd rather get one those.  Oh, ""where pens meets paper""?

Maybe I'll pass free grammar lessons tighten shit bit. helps US UK dont export production leave EU, India, China, Russia supply rest world.
Worst case EU stopping vacine export UK make domestic AZ stupid question. Right now, moral question doubling would require someone else zero vaccine, two.

But long term - interesting question I'd like answered. forehead solution start pumping J&amp;J low risk individuals go ham giving Moderna Pfizer elderly otherwise risk. **purpose** section 5.4 only

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* seems like pretty disappointing news me. Obviously better nothing, main reason young, healthy people want vaccine go back normal life without worrying infecting vulnerable person getting killed. 66% effective vaccine even close good enough that. feel like one widely available, young people hold 95% effective ones clear allowed get both. estimates efficacy SA variant based vitro sampling. hope assume big drop see results wild taken grain salt. Real world efficacy far perfectly matched Phase / II titer data. Exactly point. media lies promoting agenda omitting stories disaster Cuomo created NY.

After all, killed thousands get rid Trump worked.  I’m happy it’s hope people take end pandemic! Question whether Germans reverse position. People talk like option prioritize equity, reality “equitable” distribution vaccines would slow, need move fast one **obviously** non-vaccinated people keep wearing masks?! would nice stop spread, becomes basically cold people fully vaccinated that's good enough. It'll psych get virus, good enough. That's ok, manage well enough despite limitations.

So well, fact, I'm able tend children without crying state can't lobbying force people take unnecessary risk behalf make parental flaws.

So hey, kids can't feed teach, give free grammar lessons internet! Good skippy! I’m always skeptical time someone reports something 100% effective.  NYT? Never heard her. Can.. HAS. Killed 2 million far done. yea, virus deadly, can't spread easily. carriers weak (or dead) travel widely, obviously sick, social response dramatic. course many can't spread droplet aerosol need body fluids sex hygiene. way worse viruses SC2. Marburg, Hanta, Ebola, Rabies.. even AIDS really. Marburg 88% kill rate. SC2 1%; yet SC2 still ten times deadlier average flu year.  Canadian, like news. doubts already delivering Q1 promised deliveries, I'm making peace fact probably 2022 able safely see family friends again... tested. 

Because need gods sake. vaccine **only** creates protein. absolutely nothing else. definitely blank check. J&amp;J paid (from Washington company $1.5 billion agreement federal government support vaccine development deliver [100 million United States end June. manufacturing [lagged projected earlier month, company officials declined provide additional information pace doses likely available month month. ""

So $15 dose. That's blank check. Also stable normal refrigerator temps. high tech cold chain. Trials post-booster shot effectiveness ongoing. vaccine outperforms two available without booster. Another thing underscores importance IMHO keeping vaccination rates rate infections. I’m sure news articles today focusing severe cases, hospitalization death. honestly issue entire pandemic - enough focus long term effects “mild” “moderate” cases.

I’ll gladly rethink position J&amp;J shot actually get information this. Here’s useful way look things imo:

Say it’s March 2020, COVID arrives US, someone finds 50% people immune going hospital COVID 50% candidates serious disease... 

Add additional 10-20% natural protection.

So, point, see hospitals threatened.

And, oh ya, vaccine 50% prevent going hospital get it.

You think lock March 2020 that’s case?

If not, need fucking open 50% vaccinated. read John Oliver's voice. friends work medicine say Johnson Johnson vaccine one get. Don’t know value, believe them. Imagine trying argue words ""section 5.4 only"" includes section 5.1. Wow. Okay, literally laughing vaccine largely help end pandemic save lives already got different one. Good know want second one, though, guess...  surviving issue. Getting long term repercussions heart inflammation (seen studies fairly common young college athletes even mild cases) worries me. want walk around worried virus organs. way feel safe never get virus begin with. want one would give 95% protection virus itself. It’s isn’t RNA vaccine. don’t know fine details, big sticking point theme Yeah, much much worse. year late, I’m glad regardless they’ve done this. ESPECIALLY glad it’s traveller’s expense. extra couple thousand tack trip discourage many going anywhere regardless. likely it'd J&amp;J booster, yes, people probably get booster months later. high risk category. cut community spread. Trudeau’s government set 3 measurable markers hit year.

1) 8% population vaccinated March 30

2) 50 % population vaccinated June 30th

3) Canadian wants one vaccinated September 30th (probably estimated 80% something). 

Trust me, I’m jumping Rip Trudeau bandwagon. think *will* miss marks probably excuse it’s previous government’s fault (who hasn’t power since 2015). 

**However** don’t think Canadians abandoning hope, saying Liberals failed quite yet. would hope built delays projection planning, hope willing fight claw way meeting March 30th checkpoint. think know they’re deep trouble don’t. 

If miss March 30th checkpoint, reason demand change, conclude plan failure. Anyone know able choose vaccine get months now? looking results released today, want make sure get Pfizer Moderna. I'm guessing either spent enough time line, decided positive exposure worth giving vaccine early.  **Purpose** 5.4. , **manufacturing sites**, literally title. Learn reading stop playing stupid. EMA, like MRHA, conducting rolling review data application made. Therefore, think application made regulator satisfied enough data review application. Therefore I'm sure time formal application acceptance important.  Actually sort thinking schools could open July (maybe 4th July weekend) classes resume normal on. Summer vacation gets scrubbed...but they've school 15 months point. die, also go hospital. going hospital huge, hospital capacity large factor lockdowns. Everyone named ""Alan"" agrees. choice J&amp;J Pfizer 6-8 weeks, take J&amp;J. widely available take preferred one. I'm talking government restrictions. I'm talking vaccine. government can't make people go eat go movies feel comfortable it. state restrictions since May, businesses still struggling lots people trying spread virus around. 95% effective vaccines could turn around. I'm convinced 66% effective one will. effect? Maybe UK, Israel, Singapore Canada

How determine this? countries outside EU placed orders Pfizer-Biontech vaccines. Cool. Start actual war EU fucked vaccination programme needs scapegoat. people who’ve covid chime whether it’s easy hey didn’t die? Minister Justin Trudeau announced Canadian travellers returning overseas take COVID-19 test airport land quarantine designated hotel three days expense await results.
He says that's expected cost $2000.

International flights also limited 4 airports. information vaccine (or any) indicate affect long term affects COVID? think that’s concern many, especially healthier folks minuscule risk hospitalization death. people listened 

Like people needing masks? Dealing national crisis like pandemic takes laws, financial support, enforcement, honor system. work mask easily too, almost every day Lol alright man, please. good one. 100% hospitalizations deaths. 

This key part. issue even ONE Moderna shots probably going prevent death. They're working round 2 testing try see would look like one vaccine increase capacity.

Fernand Keuleneer, Brussels attorney “From published contract EU Commission AstraZeneca cannot conclude Commission contract therefore right side. Rather started phase 3 trials 2-dose vaccine mid-November per link /u/BoredBSEE, believe 2 month spacing, likely ready another months.

The good thing believe dosage single dose, assuming takes month get single dose logistics really running, large portion single dose subjects could potentially get booster found materially increase efficacy. im curious matters? dick, stop 99.9% deaths hospitalizations think matters. liberal pro-teacher 12 month ago. point, I've turned incredible sloth. basically, 5.4 saying later, producing many obligations finished UK treated EU get farce requiring veterinary certificates ham sandwich equivalent vaccine.  
Whereas 5.1 defines initial doses coming from.  New Jersey 50,000 cases reported January 4th? charts displayed Google search “covid new jersey” (shows data source New York Times). That’s ten times surrounding days I’m wonderint caused anomaly. also makes graph really difficult read scales days UK restricted exports anything.

The EU many vaccines wants UK AZ fulfilled contract UK.

It's UK's fault EU farted months production line ready. spent six months telling us Christmas holidays going bloodbath, stop X, Y, Z, etc., people half listened. 

I thought agreed Swedish method making recommendations work? Yeah, probably best one use. conservative controlled Utah, how? spent much time pushing class schools businesses reopen. treated Democratic hoax thanks Trump anti-maskers everywhere. State epidemiologist security detail people protesting front lawn. spent millions Hydroxychloroquine. estimated 70% Utah would vaccinated *December 2023* earlier month. sad sight sober man. they're basically turning virus another strain common flu. That's fantastic... nobody got vaccine hospital. “If vaccine-resistant SARS-CoV-2 strains emerge, vaccines might need updated. Several vaccines could easily changed reflect latest virus traveling direction could ultimately lead escape current therapeutic prophylactic interventions,"" researchers said. ""If rampant spread virus continues critical mutations accumulate, may condemned chasing evolving SARS-CoV-2 continually, long done influenza virus."" Lilly Regeneron said week working new versions drugs address new last point, plenty articles showing natural infection provides months years protection future infection. would 501Y.V2 different? you’re reading regarding “immunity evasion” primarily refers neutralizing antibodies previous infection different COVID-19 strain. find zero articles saying natural infection 501Y.V2, produce antibodies.

No one saying mutation makes immune system less effective... they’re saying previous infection variants, provide much neutralization. Two completely different things. two shots dramatically better one shot.

What's interesting papers I've seeing seem imply sort gap knowledge actually *understand* two shots required.

There may new underlying mechanism action we've discovered that's fascinating!

The issue whatever is, whatever gap knowledge caused 95% effective, may fundamental regular vaccines lower effectiveness.

My bet mRNA though also turnaround time amazing.

That CRISPR based testing Doudna working might really change world.

If ONE becomes mainstream next 5 years could mean get vaccines diseases like HPV strains example. 

And rapid / cheap CRISPR testing mean everyone interact take 5 minute test. 

Disease could really plummet point. also deployed developing nations like India China protect too.

It could also improvements farming disease among livestock could lowered too. Well took virus get places US one would ever travel willingly, made lol three people saying thing (which totally agree with) getting downvoted, cloth mask lobby guess lol false. different requirements leading significantly easier mass administration.

Well that’s one hell milestone. unfollowed Washington Post social media earlier week couldn’t take insane fearmongering keep putting out. goal posts keep moving. get vaccinated wait amount time necessary hang vaccinated people start live life International flights also limited 4 airports. illustrates point: I'm wondering what's visual difference severe infection hospitalization? basically flu-level illness, bringing COVID worse ""just flu"" huge improvement. Yes, that's something learned I'm kinda surprised. EU, flu shots given people risk getting real sick, immune conditions, old age, such. Healthy people supposed get flu shots order give way risk actually need it. really want could get anyway. lack abundance shots, standard policy.

It seems US, flu shots given everyone got explained believed cause less infections nationwide. could true, looks like promoted ""chivalrous"" thing do. Lots relatives dr's receive incentives pharma companies prescribing types meds, commercial drive could underlying reason.

I guess differing approach differing different mindsets also regarding covid vaccines I'm starting see keep getting handled ""ignorant"" ""foolish"". &amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

COVID-19 reinfection Despite awful attempt sarcasm, wrong. Supply chains systems 
 manufacturing distributing product. That’s enough reason close society. justification restrictions always hospitals. 

You justify restrictions prevent possible mutations indefinitely. Hospitalizations hard metric, one matter average joe. 

Let professionals handle mutations, maybe get us boosters every year. hospitalizations longer immediate threat, frankly people longer care.

You get real this, do. There's souls crush, gotta crush something else guess. lmaoooo wrong. people upvoting this? course they're relevant ""best reasonable efforts"".

If like clarity, perhaps contract:

*To extent AstraZeneca’s performance Agreement impeded competing agreements, AstraZeneca shall deemed breach Agreement result delay due aforementioned competing agreement(s).* I’m little slow lmao.

You’re spreading fake news. AZ vaccine authorized people 65 EU. Depends live, schools state fully virtual deaths sample size people willing participate. It’s unexpected really way say inferior vaccine better nothing.

Even 50% AZ doses comments hilarious. like angry little man getting someone's face shoving accusing trying start trouble. want proof see calm British government's comments been. Michael Gove even hinted might share EU.

The eu taking ""common enemy"" approach attempt keep unity. sad. Murrica Wow would expected upper Western part world would deny completely take even dying. bad headline saw NYT even CNN reported 85% hospitalizations number This. would make sense. still least month away J&amp;J shipping first doses, may already vaccinated significant portion vulnerable population US Pfizer/Moderna J&amp;J widely available. excellent question, responses got helpful I've included link comment big comment above. would like linked, please let know. long wastes time ;-)

There nothing argue about, section 5.4 explains everything manufacturing sites, valid whole contract.

What use would definition referred section 5.4? Reagan massively popular among Republicans, Centrists/Independents, Democrats. 49 states second term, considered one popular presidents modern history. Biden gets us covid rescues economy avoids scandal could wildly popular. think also risk-benefit analysis- there's clearly potential benefit influenza vaccination, even otherwise young healthy people, low risk associated vaccine. 

I agree there's less ""you must get flu shot save people flu!"" attitude Covid, exception healthcare workers- required get many parts US. Part discrepancy due people's lack understanding flu (ie, vast majority time someone says flu, actually influenza). Influenza viewed serious precisely gets confused many less serious respiratory viruses.

It definitely interesting hear non-US viewpoints matter, though, think tend assume whole world things way do! wonder figures damage? imagine 65% ""protected"", mean 35% severe reactions. probably likely damage done (heart inflammation) significantly reduced getting ""65% protection"" probably almost par 95% double vaccines. protection also much higher 65% let immunity build 4 weeks (which par 95% vaccines, get 95% day 1, get two shots fair weeks). seem giving people liberty freedom via poor governance... average result better society, pandemic not. thing I'm sure qualify high risk. friend age, early 20s, asthma die COVID months back. also asthma I'm sure much COVID would affect caught it. autopsies needed. X-rays MRIs Unfortunately right, ignore downvotes. People 30 significant risk getting long-term damage, realize yet. course many people catch perfectly fine, risk high. 

If Covid infection mild limited upper respiratory tract, looking trouble. virus, contrast many others, able infect many tissues body, ACE2 ubiquitously expressed. even consider basic biology, high risk long-term complications.

I go examples evidence actual risk group virus 30+ year olds, 65+. Sure gets severe age increases, really want get Covid risk effects. 

But means, concentrate death rates ignore everything else. logic absolutely problem jump 2nd floor young, die, let's then?   Many EU member states made mandatory wear masks public places long time ago. science behind risk transmitting/catching virus lot lower people wear masks. Obviously, need change mask often possible (usually every time go out). heard anything it.

What/who said J&amp;J vaccine? 5.4 describes manufacturing sites clear uk plants included. EU published nCov-19 vaccine contract AstraZenica it, slew redactions I'm curious redacted things redacted.

Also, mean EU little disingenuous contract AstraZenica? is, UK truthful EU said supported contract posted ... ? one also western Pa agree trying get right difficult. 

My wife health care field random Facebook post figure sign office.

It’s frustrating Western PA still thinks it’s 1981 comes technology 1881 comes social policy Swedish posted urgent message social media around 11 p.m. Thursday saying hundreds appointments available 11 p.m. 2 a.m. use vaccines expired morning. Hundreds people answered call showed pajamas robes receive first dose vaccine. Thanks checking, appreciate concern. wrong supposed 18th, would awful! don’t think Canadians abandoning hope

It's harder harder every day lose hope. News like make worse. thanks. I'll wait Pfizer Moderna. would take 66% know there's 95% there, planning get summer anyway? friends pandemic?

JK miss seeing friend person. Good question! release website:

""The safety profile consistent vaccine candidates using Janssen’s AdVac® technology among 200,000 people date. Overall fever rates 9% Grade 3 fever 0.2%. Overall serious adverse events (SAEs) reported higher participants received placebo compared active vaccine candidate. anaphylaxis observed."" Or, none things could happen. 

If it’s irresponsible media overplay concerns prey people’s fears (agreed), it’s incumbent upon social media users thing. meant relate statements manufacturing sites, they'd written ""manufacturing sites"", ""section 5.4 only"".

I can't believe I'm even arguing this.

No, say that. confusing reddit posts qualified opinions. German regulators outstanding, even rich European country (heard couple experts past months). EU regulators decided benefits far outweighed risks current situation. normal cirumstances highly doubt would authorized it. remember seeing tweet journalist question saying provide sources evidence anonymity seems convenient me. 

Not really. standard practice journalism agree source considered anonymous, immediately blurt identity questioned. must surely heard incredibly common practice ever seen newspaper. exactly suspicious. mental acrobatics performed media make J&amp;J vaccine sound like bad news truly amazing wonder would use J&amp;J vaccine vaccinate people less risk severe illness, well rural populations. mRNA vaccines seems better preventing illness, especially variants, J&amp;J least prevented severe illness several weeks. want get people vaccinated ASAP, wonder they’ll consider J&amp;J vaccine healthy young people, students, younger essential workers, etc. get vaccinated sooner reserve mRNA vaccine people really need extra boost effectiveness. That's great want Moderna/Pfizer-Biontech. entitled keep waiting till turn offered receive that. beggar shouting ""BUT WANNA GO THINGS!""

Considering poisitions going 2020 I'm surprised we're worse honestly. yup...so pretty much vaccines around 50%-75% aside mRNA vaccines, around 90%.

Sputnik V ""regular"" vaccine supposedly boasts 85%+ .... Ability logistically safety/efficacy standpoint?

Logistically know. Safety wise, there's obvious concerns mixing beyond stronger immune responses initially vaccinated. would likely fever, etc single dose Moderna/Pfizer previously JnJ (or live infection). much concern. Perhaps many doses quick succession could perhaps cause real issues.

Efficacy wise, one quantified exact numbers mixing matching, always titer antibodies months later folks doctors office checkup blood draw setting get booster need one. TL;DR: Accusations online vaccination appointment program mainly benefited wealthier English speakers internet access instead needed vaccine ok did, now? ;-)

It relates statements manufacturing sites whole contract. Literally title section. everybody see, except trolls obviously. Lmao hopefully don’t crash civic find lexus It’s still way main website well. Ah 8% then... interesting. 🤔 That’s true.

We’ve got leaked version EU contract it’s quite clear it’s sold cost July 2021. everything afterwards profit.

Why lie? wouldn’t surprised find they’re cost end either across contracts. state that?

In Texas, people going droves without vaccine.

Additionally, asked call comorbidities, indicated significant percentage (I believe 40% I'm certain) sample comorbidities.

Therefore, sample large vulnerable age groups comorbities included, one would expect see hospitalizations deaths among contracted disease. none vaccination group. say that, unfortunately, hospitalizations deaths control group. heavily pushed narrative ""be doctor rich"" pushed people doctors becoming doctors. feel countries non issue. anything think people willing vaccinate effect becomes obvious skeptical population. Would take Sinopharm vaccine Pfizer least half year away? seems situation like Hungary. thinking long term. example would take whatever available hopefully summer access stronger vaccine. ever say otherwise?

Everything going fine  Guardian can't headline makes EU look like bad guy. might lose readers!

Worth pointing anger Dublin too. Dakotas herd immunity already?

No. serology testing show that. 1442 positive 	13395 tested North Dakota. Nowhere near levels needed herd immunity even factor false negatives. Efficacy probably close 80% average young person. 66% number entire population, including seniors. Would pretty effective strategy split like 100% hospitalizations deaths

The number really matters. We've 100% capacity restaurants Indiana now. I'm looking forward able toss masks.  always respectful wear indoors, it'd nice never wear again. Unfortunately, seems like there's group going push us wear long science tells us longer necessary. 


As overall point, see J&amp;J Vaccine positive news way around. Within week. study. 
I've known multiple people gotten sick covid directly getting vaccine. joke given people know covid nothing got covid regardless vaccine. 
The vaccine made quickly without proper research. 
That's large majority company's incentivize people take money. missed AZ effective 100% efficacy developing serious infection!

that study nowhere near comprehensive enough. bit like tossing coin 3 times noticing came heads 3 times making claim coin must two-headed. well short understanding efficacy across age groups. UK strain affecting children differently way, they’ve noticed increase kids hospitals needing care. predicted this. Situation extremely hot. I’m sorry. beginning pandemic Trump blocked much needed N95 masks coming Canada.... Even though Canada supplied raw materials make them. Trust broken US Canada far nothing done repair relationship. cant speak everyone else Canada, one, kinda tired America's actions dont know ever get back pre-covid relationships (sorry!) want true badly.  3 kids one worry disabled year half young Pfizer vaccine right now.  put kids list local children's hospital said desperately needed pediatric participants vaccine trials far heard back. friends idiots. get whatever vaccine available you. Ah well, eligible vaccine yet, worry are. possible whatever available change time eligible. :) Good question, hopefully yes population density France never full lockdown either, always schools open autumn way metro areas even country side way populated. thing keep mind (as mentioned above) possibility retooling agents better deal new variants. impression would easiest mRNA recombinant protein vaccines (that is, Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech, Pfizer) harder viral-vector ones (J&amp;J AZ/Oxford). 

I think there's error, Pfizer got mentioned twice, think 2nd Pfizer mention Novavax.  Section 5.4 INCLUDES UK EU, section


BUT

Section 5.1 says AZ shall ""manufacture Initial Europe Doses WITHIN EU"". section UK included EU

It matter relates manufacturing. Within 5.1, EU mentioned, UK included. Hi yeah same. know wouldn’t come back second jab, mature don’t like needles. J J please! definitely want since less-developed hotspot regions like Brazil S. Africa shown they're prime fertile areas new mutations take hold.  Iron curtain?? free go want, bear self responsibility cost choice. help us able ease restrictions within border, benefit all. Kinda like countries implemented similar measures previously much lower level deaths, recovering economies. sound entitled me, sound opposite. Giving ""free"" dose early 66% vaccine way harms chances getting one ""good"" ones normal time would gotten anyways. mention take away someone else, selfless decent point

For record I'm totally you. universe I'm allowed get 66% one someone put bucket, access mrna one ever, I'm going pissed. left apartment since May want fucking good stuff too. think get one wait good one  case herd immunity. That's wishful thinking. Mask use hit time high US.  mobility decreased lot well. much easier explain drop using actual data rather wishful thinking based personal anecdotes supported data. lot articles “experts” saying beginning. Thank sensible comment Maybe shortfall production issue much. Maybe misplaced finding bottle bottle. think maybe stock market doesn’t understand immunology medicine?

I’m viral immunologist assure sub knows jack shit immunology. biology doesnt work like neither economics psychology. Sometimes 1 dose good results simply worth 2. Let's say 1st give 95% efficacy. second dose raises 98%. Epidemiologists, insurers, doctors going recommend second dose. difference dose 1 2 increases odds general consensus get second dose start shifting. also take account prevalence disease. may rare disease perfectly happy 85% efficacy good enough stop pandemic breaking out. even second dose raises 99% may decide simply worth cost. Need vaccine. Drugstores give out. priority groups still enough vaccine. SELL SELL SELL  think it’s safe say vaccine would massively decrease long lasting effects Covid. None vaccines guarantee completely. many people 80 included. You’re also incorrect, look votes, haven’t even downvoted yet. part California in? We've getting hit rain bad last days. (Central Valley) also appears case Socal. 

It finally cleared us today. am, think first, right. example people use facts make decisions health time, course black community factual, concrete reasons trusting government tells health, incredibly significant. perspective off. LA County health officials always skeptical bloomberg numbers saying administered 70% doses remaining process given scheduled patients upcoming days. wanted know extra missing vials mass vaccination sites half-empty due supply constraints. I'm sorry realize vaccines readily available. go get one today?

Nobody arguing J&amp;J vaccine better Pfizer. big point hell lot better vaccine all. FTFY

US *un*likely first Western nation crush Covid-19

I've seen news. New Zealand. Australia. Even UK.

Not things improve Biden, countries already ahead us.

Not sure include Israel Western nation, do, they're way ahead US. Yeah, I'm exhausted too.

We careful way think things. repeat idea ""I fight"", likely make fighting thing end doing.

There's way makes things better, brings people together, require ""fighting"". starts inside us. minute stop believing things better, minute seal fate.

So I'm going damndest stay positive, empathize, try see humanity people share struggle heart. alternative world nobody that.

EDIT: regarding senior year, think lot people feel way lots life events they've put off. supposed get married last summer (LOL), delayed June, delayed summer 2022 safe. exhausting. decided *will* get married 2022, reschedule again, even modifications kind needed (god hope not). FDA needing trials US soil EUA excessively bureaucratic circumstances. Surely UK trials involved Blacks Asians too? do.whatever want to. Children must've back school talking points get some.sort priority. think replied wrong person Okay nice talking you. Thanks calling liar. Yet vaccine open license could much faster vaccinations globally, instead EU push ahead vaccination estimates AZs production problems.

That seems like better deal paying tiny bit less. EU also unilaterally suspended Northern Ireland protocol agreed one month ago, without even bothering inform UK going it, UK government spent last weeks resisting strident calls DUP same, leading demands even moderate Unionists retaliation.

So, thanks that, Ursula Von Der Trump. Mobility across US decreased across US mask usage hit time high  

Vaccination account decrease decrease cases began wide spread roll vaccine. don’t know anyone else, I’m less concerned vaccine effectiveness regards person does/doesn’t contract virus, concerned vaccine still prevents severe disease large % population. 

If get vaccinated means get additional week cold like symptoms every year ... that’s fine. pandemic sniffles isn’t really pandemic chances getting vaccine next two three months slim none matter vaccine available. I’m behind millions people state, including hundreds thousands retired winter visitors aren’t really counted population don’t live full time. It’s unclear asthma put accelerated group; state decides it’s risky enough I’ll move right back line. happens, don’t expect vaccinated June later. 

There’s also need take two vaccines one would suffice. would depriving someone dose deserve took two. happen live city infrastructure dispense Pfizer Moderna. take best available minimizes risk me, would want to? 

I get probably sound entitled folks, that’s okay. can’t control people see me. expressing frustration people get decide get less effective vaccine don’t fit box old vulnerable enough, frankly that’s bullshit. I’ve worn mask, stayed home, skipped celebrations, part educate friends, family, coworkers stay safe/keep others safe time. “over” I’ll still probably wear mask flu season I’m feeling weather. Given that, would want get best vaccine available?

This vaccine good enough areas communities literally option available due infrastructure. said, probably focus efforts vaccinating many people possible effective vaccines possible, especially interested tamping transmission enough slow viral mutation. 

I’m also encouraged reports J&amp;J consider pneumonia sign “severe” COVID; placed “moderate” category. Forgive looking deciding would rather wait effective vaccine take chances less effective one. UK blocked exports. did? Canada Israel would affected block. fault? different Christmas Portugal Christmas Spain Italy ? crank one though? 

Even want one shot vaccine, AstraZeneca vaccine provides comparable efficacy starting 3 weeks first shot (while J&amp;J one takes 50 days reach peak antibody titers) Moderna vaccine reported give 80% immunity one dose. know much says ""High-profile COVID-19 vaccines developed Russia China share potential shortcoming: based common cold virus many people exposed to, potentially limiting effectiveness, experts say.""

So sound like Russian vaccine changed way, usual way prevent replication. time mandatory shots next school year I'm sure. hey jabbed 3 times 6th grade something I'm fine. I'm high school teacher teenage daughter home. Keeping daughter point Zoom class run Zoom classes nearly impossible....and I'm educator. Stop pointing fingers parents. That’s one way put it. unilateral act treachery might accurate. way low priority (47, comorbidities, working risk fields)

Then worry one getting... almost every vaccine requires multiple doses, don’t ask repeat doses. Even year apart. think really depends Superbowl Sunday. Let's honest admit interpersonal social gatherings that's putting surges overdrive. party 3 4 different families going magnify spread. going catch covid picking pizza shopping Target. prolonged interaction among friends/family un-masked, indoors amplifies community transmission. considering confidently incorrect everything, that's compliment coming you.
 
thanks! participated J&amp;J vaccine trial one dose November. unblinded week ago second dose offered Phizer vaccine (I'm frontline health care worker offered vaccine sooner anticipated - informed consenting Dr health care worker would get vaccine soon offered one advised participate anyway - consent ofc) confirmed active arm - guessed based side effects. withdraw trial point get 2nd dose 

They said point active arm needed one dose Phizer vaccine, data Oxford one. efficacy data mixed data said would published end month (I seen yet looked). sounds promising people J&amp;J vaccine, followed one dose Phizer, possibly vaccines get optimal coverage. also imply got original COVID-19 strain, vulnerable variants? That's really good enough unless gonna given non critical workers 30 people vaccinated weeks vaccinating naturally infected course year. Yes haven’t contained well prior this, it’s possible mix good bad. many people black white this. That's great news rollout starting slower EU. result less people vaccinated EU horde vaccines die  Yeah, went CLS 2011, 2012 deployment done away sticking people. wound dressing, applying tourniquets litter carries.

It super useful skill little bummed never got chance it. Yeah I’d wearing one. 2 4
These reactionary clickbait articles really causing mistrust. “Oh you’re telling one mask isn’t enough trust vaccine then?” teacher get make scheduling decisions. guarantee it. knows developmentally inappropriate, wants keep job, school board paper pushers demand her. arguing AZs obligation produce vaccine EU takes precedence obligation deliver 300 million doses time? 

That would reflect spirit contract. Surely, everybody knows important actually deliver vaccine create work opportunities EU.

So argument AZ cannot fulfill obligations, “best effort” focus fulfilling important part contract, i.e. deliver vaccine time. depends many vaccines get out. vaccinate highest-risk 20% population, 90% deaths prevented, even there's spike, nearly bad. quick post history gander: They're antimasker (muh CO2), think ADHD fake caused diet, think covid death stats lie, variants ""invented"", seem think Holocaust hoax, host insane positions.

Wild. virus mutates something immune system cannot handle, get Manaus... sure D+ anything proud gunk comes Alabama.

He means this. work done UK European get stuff UK though. Supply chain goes Canada too. experts warned already letting commission. think asthma makes high risk. look group get vaccinated soon. rapid antigen tests hella inaccurate though? you’re doomscrolling subreddit, scared. I’m sorry, that’s facts. lawyer read interpreted (see above) opposite interpretation, likelihood insanely stupid EU tell AZ publish contract, huge self EU depends. might stop transmission much. However it’s 100% effective hospitalization (from data), long hospitals aren’t overwhelmed, return normal. Agree. Like fatal viruses, hurts body stops working, organs fail. Duh. like saying people die suffer cardiac arrest. True, really helpful news. Yes, although single dose. better comparison AZD (62-70%) since similar method, single dose. 100% effective hospitalizations death single dose. bad safe cheap. get lot use. Agreed, great lower risk population countries areas may ability store mRNA vaccines Depending various country's vaccine uptake reproduction number virus time, good experiments revealed prevent epidemic (reduce peak vaccine efficacy least 60% vaccination coverage 100% (reproduction number=2.5–3.5). vaccine efficacy threshold rises 70% coverage drops 75% 80% coverage drops 60% reproduction number 2.5, rising 80% coverage drops 75% reproduction number 3.5. extinguish ongoing epidemic, vaccine efficacy least 60% coverage 100% least 80% coverage drops 75% reduce peak 85%–86%, 61%–62%, 32% vaccination occurs 5%, 15%, 30% population, respectively, already exposed COVID-19 coronavirus. vaccine efficacy 60% 80% could still obviate need measures certain circumstances much higher, cases, potentially unachievable, vaccination coverages.

Video swedes bus. single one wearing spread comes private gatherings people take masks. can’t speak haven’t asked himBut agree lot people would ridiculous wasnt largely control summer Seems pretty decent given logistical advantages! would happily take soonest available option  Still quite good single-shot vaccine, though.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* necessarily mean initial EU doses limited EU manufacturing.

It sounds like promise AZ EU manufacturing EU straight start, limitation initial EU doses come from. That’s misleading all. 1/3 chance still getting Covid terrible. means could still spread around carrier. sure hell don’t want shot Australia really west definitions like troll farms given new propaganda message push.

If scroll thread, find people quoting actual contract. note contract fact confirm EU saying - AZ obligated deliver vaccines even UK plants. literally name several UK plants one Appendices.

By contrast ""EU incompetent"" people never actually quote contract, look post history basically people busy sucking Nigel Farange.

This very, obviously yet another demonstration broken ""leadership"" style UK, believes PR away problems instead actually fixing damn problems. That's AZ busy pushing useless vaccine war propaganda (which solves nothing), whereas Pfizer talks old rival Sanofi push vaccine production (because production shortfall real problem). 
Note 85% effective severe disease 100% preventing hospitalization.

Also zero severe disease 49 days. 

This still good.  Schedule end document clearly includes UK facilities Mexicos excess death toll even worse. March Nov 20th recorded 251,800 excess deaths, 0.21% entire population. Meanwhile due severe lack testing undercounting deaths, official death toll “only” 100,000 time March-Nov period.

Since winter wave (Dec Jan) they’ve recorded additional 55,000 confirmed deaths (and likely many unrecorded).

This would make Mexico’s per capita excess death toll worst world, along Peru. Whenever next update excess deaths include winter, expect results going pretty shocking.

Source: UK would approve based seems. US want doses could donate South America? prevented moderate severe disease 80% people-- huge. about?

It's obviously humorous I'm saying good thing I'd get shot heartbeat right could. 66% comparable Moderna Pfizer’s 92-95% efficacy?

Candidate 72% Effective US 66% Effective Overall Preventing Moderate Severe COVID-19, 28 Days Vaccination*  Effective Overall Preventing Severe Disease Demonstrated Complete Protection COVID-19 related Hospitalization Death Day 28*

Still far easier roll out. might book international trip 2022 I'm staying locked like fucking hermit spring 2022. I'll seeing friends, family, etc get vaccinated likely summer, I'm willing bet I'm minority.

Laughs Asian evidence vaccine prevents symptoms. Plenty people indeed get infected present mild symptoms. 

One indeed infected virus develop disease. Seems like focusing fact it’s effective preventing severe disease, hospitalization, death  Matter opinion - considerably easier get everyone needs it. Also appears trials prevent anyone getting seriously ill, sure Pfizer that. 

As boosters - proof impossible? 

There unanswered question Pfizer - whether delaying second dose actually give better immune response, case vaccines. We'll find one day. (Connecticut), able choose make appointment location select say ""we administering Pfizer/Moderna today""...so I'm optomistic. Dollar store shots

You sound like nice person. 1 3 chance nothing..   AZ reasonably explain production delays EU facilities 

To EU's satisfaction. AZ provided explanation EU team happy hence conducted inspection plant. paper described hospitalization rates age group, younger aged adults 11-15% likely go hospital covid similar older ages. cases skyrocket upon opening could still crush healthcare system boost overall death rates. unpaywalled link here: serious this?

Because it’s number that’s reported every vaccine whole time. vaccines nearly 100% prevention severe cases 100% prevention deaths. Don’t pretend isn’t disappointing news. makes sense - that’s Commission providing additional CMOs help AZ told Commission capacity issues . would Commission provide one UK sites CMO? would require Commission contract separately manufacturing plants Uk notify AZ.

Hardly country mindless conformists, managed control pre-vaccines sacrifice far fewer citizens. That's expected happen covid, reliable treatment made big deal hospitals everything would back normal. Certainly expect vaccines come first.  lockdowns need end Spring even. worse problems still shutdown purgatory end year. flu reliably mutates seasonally. odds wont get choose vaccine get, supply far limited I've told kids they'll eventually get vaccine (they excited that) also told grown ups getting first, it'll awhile.

TBH they'd happy skip shot, lol. (I still get recommended available.) 2022 even think US would use them. new variants look going forward fastest platforms mRNA. sister family got Pfizer vaccine two weeks later asymptomatic Covid-19.  really skeptical .04% would mean mathmatically sister family like 10,000,000 - 1 happen.

Now section 5.1 talks manufacturing mentions ""EU"" (could also section contract). mean...? Let us look relevant section **5.4 Manufacturing Sites**

This makes clear: EU **includes** UK ask doctor every year getting high dose flu vaccine well even though intentionally reserved 65+? say charlatans blatant liars. That's cool. recently got Brazilian variant States too. call us ""melting pot"" reason! Good expect supply increase states. Right NJ receiving 130,000 doses week rate would take almost 100 weeks vaccinate everyone 16. don’t understand keep seeing we’re gonna get 400 million doses Pfizer/Moderna end may seems like we’re almost 24 months away full vaccination. rate supply supposed increase dramatically states next months dubious given we’ve seen basically change past month. somebody assuage anxiety hard time believing we’re going ramp supplies state meet timelines see time. getting vaccine want covid. 

There enough vaccines go around right now, need encourage people get vaccinated point. using fame skip line ridiculous people giving pass. What's equivalent percentage unvaccinated? Isn’t AstraZeneca failure people 65? J&amp;J going delayed months want test different regimens? AZ supposed get approval US like month two ago, got phase 3 results underwhelming approval discussions kinda... Stopped? block. delay export till domestic orders fulfilled. Thanks response already giving vaccines away. vaccines produced EU, largest vaccine production world (76%). like US banned exports. would BioNTech/Pfizer vaccines UK, Israel, Canada, ... would swim vaccines.. IAAL, correct.

It’s huge leap logic say need make best efforts produce EU don’t manage don’t make best efforts deliver have. It’s simply what’s page.  Need citation it’s significant cohort. data common long term effects are, anecdotes. I’m gonna need see statistical proof long term effects common mild cases start worry cause personal anecdotes haven’t seen single person know that’s long term effects even serious case time that’s people old 23-98 So, Canada buy vaccine n UK. Good. can’t protect nebulous group symptoms may may related Covid. 

We need stop acting like ‘long Covid’ proven actual diagnosis. child psychologist/psychiatrist? expert child psychology? Looking history, humans survived thrived much worse circumstances happening now. Give people credit. resilient. realize blonde hair natural, right? (j/k, j/k... really :p ) Agreed. crazy see hysteria shifting goals. lot people speaking J&amp;J vaccine people getting sniffles worse case need continue reopening fast. can't keep things shut eradicate COVID (good chance never happens) stay home years. create far worse problems. Literally almost 0 percent chance asymptomatic transmission Apparently, health experts say case. course, lower priority get mRNA already got J&amp;J, question. We’ve handled way — kids understand virus primarily threat others, especially grandparents. anxiety 5-year-old daughter felt primarily around parents grandparents getting sick. doesn’t really worry herself.

We never promised kids vaccine — they’re happy Grandma Poppy appointment theirs. look last two sentences 5.4, contract states happen “If AstraZeneca unable deliver intention manufacture initial Europe doses..”. states available CMOs EU (which includes U.K.) used, reference schedule A. schedule (page 39) explicity list several U.K. plants substance manufacturing REDACTED (FR/BE), REDACTED (I/NL), REDACTED (UK) REDACTED (UK).”
“Drug product manufacturing REDACTED (ITL), REDACTED (DE), REDACTED (UK) potential suppliers”.** I’m 21 take whatever vaccine offered first. I’m shit picky need sway public opinion right now. Demand grossly outweighs supply. I'm making anti-vaxx trust vaccines result bring right even bigger demand supply grow equally.

If stocks vaccines collecting dust enough people making line get shot, would agree, situation way today. Novafax 85.6% effective UK variant, implying 2 fold drop Pfizer/Moderna reflected results. 

If 2 fold, would assume fold 5%. 6.5 fold, 32.5%. it’s 8.5 fold, 42.5%. Meaning 95% minus 32.5 63.5 minus 42.5 53.5. guess sited try convince people headline alone shots dumped something. Theoretically could useful. 

Combining two different [Malaria shown effective taking unique strengths types mixing them.

But would theory coronavirus vaccine since probably tested yet anyway might need get Coronavirus vaccines every 12 months anyway.  dont know... sure wont dead might give trouble virus counterpart vaccine, would pick one pfizer higher chance combat severe symptoms, especially since last long time (if lifetime) LMFAO. No. Yes completely agree. mean much easier vaccines distribute. Especially LDCs isn’t much infrastructure, etc. Time tell, imagine least year. Worse case scenario come back second dose Maybe train manufacture instead. Masks help, properly. tell country, mask mandate, people running around chin shields nose bears soon work hit dropped. infections happen masks worn properly, happened dreaded shields wearing them. Still least one case family covid infected person (who dead now) prevented infection mother law wore masks! know. many information know believe. Many even claim live like even 2023.

 fear new variants discovered vaccination slow even rich countries.  Moderne mid size company. Like german Biontech. Moderna can’t produce much Pfizer. 

Without Biontech bold move cooperate Pfizer ASAP doomed. possible? 50%! fast! happened? covidactnow.org R0 estimates state (and county!) well I'm curious math here. 

1442 positive 13395 tested suggests \~11% ND Covid. However, today, ND 97,330 confirmed cases population 762,062 (based Google searches stats), would mean \~13% ND Covid.

Isn't general consensus true cases greatly undercounted compared confirmed cases, possibly 3-5-fold depending region? serology mean undercounting cases ND whatsoever?

Apologies I'm misunderstanding something important here. serology numbers confirmed infection numbers seem compatible me.

Thanks :) Work?! love generic/coined responses show nothing. would disagree, English lawyer, definition Initial Europe Doses caught within definition Vaccine, they’re also caught 5.4.

5.4 kicks production 5.1 fails, whereas delivery obligation 5.1 separate issue unrelated. cannot infer obligation deliver 5.1 doses procured elsewhere - that’s unjustified leap. I'll take good medical breakthroughs emerging pharmaceutical development mass public compliance day. well confirmed infections, estimates around 30% 1/3 US population infected (including asymptomatic cases)  Yeah ok. Yeah saying that’s would happen, U.K. obviously doesn’t want EU deaths necessary illustrate EU thinks holds cards, they’re sorely mistaken. yeah, no, haven't. can't open cages yet. One doctor’s opinion isn’t data  long run people get JJ one might actually end getting two dose one later supplies plentiful. BioNTech licensed they’re partnership Pfizer. basically sold recipe Pfizer BioNTech really small company couldn’t mass produce vaccine own. It’s like Oxford University partner AstraZeneca. 

Pfizer hasn’t given away recipe all, they’re profiting massively. AstraZeneva currently vaccine that’s 1) sold cost price 2) shared recipe vaccine producers.  ""bony talons"" nice depends. last year (italy) serious 2 month lockdown summer. literally flattened curve spent mostly carefree summer. we'll see goes year, i'm kinda pessimistic considering southern emisphere countries spikes summer. “oh dont worry variants”

OK, bub. Thanks.

Johnson Johnson vaccine efficacy 90% 60%~

OK, bub. Thanks: Feel like they’ve “considering” ages everyone else vaccinated, wont anyone hospitals 

Sure make large proportion, frankly doesnt matter everyone 18+ already vaccinated anyway Everything West depending frame reference single dose pfizer vaccine [was either 52% 89% based looked data. Pfizer's data showed 52% Uk vaccine Committee saw evidence make 14 days without catching efficacy jumps 89%. looked data day 15-21 removed early infections vaccine taken effect. possible single dose RNA vaccines nearly good double dose know single dose would provide equal lasting protection. stock market understands lot bunch random redditors. EU countries, even without Sputnik (60-70 % adults, population). Bom chika wah wah. ""85% effective preventing **severe disease""** (and ""66% effective overall) - whereas mRNA vaccines effective even mild, moderate severe infections.

Given unpredictable virus is, even young healthy adults, long term effects we're seeing, would much rather protected mild disease well severe. yes, good, prevent lot deaths, good vaccines.

\*i'm doctor health expert that's think I'm reading hearing pretty awake already, Dr. Fauci, thanks reminder. read girlfriend who's qualified knows contract law. Israel count? far east? idea ""Western-ness"" treat New Zealand? Australia? good know. colleague freaking delays administering second dose. saying means vaccination 20% effective second shot even one day late. much misinformation going around... J&amp;J (and maybe even Novavax) think April definitely possible. Also get stimulus package next weeks probably gonna ton money vaccination staff Since beginning, CDC maintained list conditions co-morbidities definitely increases risk bad outcome. amorphous, impossible-to-define group.

Absolutely. Keep mind 66% protection moderate disease includes people spared cough fever vaccine well people pulled bony talons grim reaper survived cough fever.

In words, 34% still got moderate disease may people whose moderate disease affected vaccine, people even going make ambulance everything between.

Yes, worse Pfizer vaccine, _by means garbage_. Yeah think May looking pretty likely. main hangup children getting vaccine approved them, rollout itself. Also need sterilizing immunity studied clearly defined vaccines. herd immunity even possible vaccination? question this. transmiy basically still virus dont get sick. Isn’t matter time mutates immunity goes window? mean still transferable, won’t go away hide mutates  put words mouth; said. said idea talking about, clear idea teachers face every day. think quite likely elderly risk Phase 1 receive Pfizer Moderna. J J others play bigger role vaccine rolled general population. God hope so. Children make 24% population. There's way herd immunity happens without Um, I'm US, I'm UK fully aware Variants spreading. point variants develop nations vaccinated slowly, likely mutate around vaccine make less effective. situation every country around world dangerous.

And vaccine production still scaling up. also point this, vaccines prove effective wealthier countries, reopen money support populace fund vaccine production, go directly towards supporting poorer countries issues securing supply.

Also Oxford Vaccine licensed AZ strictly sold cost, meaning cheap possible made profit. variations price due much country invests supply production facilities. information many reports (commendably) handling Israel. making policy that's I'd framing it, J&amp;J perfectly acceptable younger person without health conditions. boosters needed line give we're past public health crisis.

The UK deal (I guess USA Israel well) signed months EU ones seem state, provide UK quota first export wherever. makes sense considering far ahead countries approval vaccinations rollout.

Were pharmaceutical companies supposed wait around commission make decisions start production vaccines?

The AZ production UK seems destined EU next. hope start shipping poorer countries without infrastructure decided COVAX alternative program - whilst setting factories poorer countries. Agreed. appreciate discussion. (As far I'm aware please correct I'm wrong) add information peoples contracts another contract. 

There public announcement regarding UK plants UK first. Reading EU - AZ contract ambiguity depending read clauses 2 sections. first saying EU initial doses made EU another referencing specific clause UK plants considered EU plants.

I still get think UK big secret come recently baffling way. UK using doses delivered. contracts stipulate 100m doses met UK plants exporting world wide required.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* J&amp;J says vaccine prevented 66% moderate severe cases Covid-19, 85% severe infections 100% hospitalizations.

Moderna says vaccine provided 94% efficacy ""the majority adverse events mild moderate severity"".

What difference really? sounds bit like potato, potahto. words, one vaccine 85% efficacy severe disease 94% efficacy thing. don’t think read contract. crystal clear, wrong. sure though. 2% overwhelming hospital Fauci kinda turned cheerleader. King covid treatments. That's reasonably soon, cool heard little development Novavax product at. think people annoyed used supply certain regions already. Which, way, good know infrastructure place use got timely manner, optics standing around supply left frustrating part. anticipate fat CDC update today stat better worse Chinese one severe hospitalization/death cases?

What people elderly + chronic illness? Severe case could still kill them???  know excess! know ones would work! Yeah, Pro-America bullshit right here. one worst countries planet virus, rampant spreading stupidity. virus roll bad. 

Fuck article, utter bullshit. countries already gotten virus control, countries like New Zealand cases, without vaccine. Fuck bullshit. saying would personally take vaccine medical agency consider reputable approves it

Okay It’s important remember doesn’t mean necessarily evolve much different much worse. flu changes every year hasn’t suddenly evolved kill everyone. common cold germs. might change bypass immunity probably won’t change enough suddenly turns MERS suddenly can’t keep vaccinations. think they’ll sending grunts minimal training jabs. It’s repeatedly mentioned manpower huge issue. Given state AZ's manufacturing, doubt excess doses ship US even approved. think I've ever denied it. world unfair shitty place. J&amp;J released long one shot sufficient protection? Like 1-2 weeks second shot Pfizer Moderna. 

As healthy WFH 30 year old who's good needles, actively want J&amp;J vs others. One shot risk hospitalization basically goes away? I'm in. Jab me. kids vaccinated, reservoir Doesn’t sound like promise contrariwise, according analysis AstraZeneca vaccine 70% effective single shot. could calling single-shot vaccine too. especially single dose. purposeful gamble, looks like paid worth. agree IME people growing jaded complacent attitudes toward covid. don’t think vaccines significant effect yet places though, likely level immunity, plus natural trailing holiday surge plus maybe little bit vaccine effect. states around 1-2% population fully vaccinated far. wondering, countries exempt this:

***Which exports exempt?***

Exports Republic Albania, Andorra, Bosnia Herzegovina, Faeroe Islands, Republic Iceland, Principality Liechtenstein, Montenegro, Kingdom Norway, Republic North Macedonia, Republic San Marino, Serbia, Swiss Confederation, Vatican City State, overseas countries,  territories listed Annex II Treaty Functioning European Union, exports Büsingen, Heligoland, Livigno, Ceuta Melilla, Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Syria, Tunisia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Israel, Moldova Ukraine.

Exports facilities located continental shelf Member State exclusive economic zone declared Member State pursuant United Nations Convention Law sure getting from. US contract 300M AZ doses. currently used approved FDA. Also, unless AZ US manufacturing capacity, doubt UK EU let ship doses US. sounds like you’re hard time understand conversation Must pretty nice mental health issues, addiction, past trauma, economic worries, anything else would make isolation year difficult.  upset that. realize rich countries hypocrites. upset people denying lol, seem longer do, great. 30 years defunding education attacking teachers' unions preceded it. Personally, healthy person mid 20's, I'd happy thankful J&amp;J vaccine ASAP positivity rates hospitalizations seemed plateau. ICU numbers lag behind quite bit patients ICU care typically while. Things seem turning around, good see, article 2% hospitalized rcvd vaccine, important note dont specify patients fully vaccinated rcvd one dose.

The good news US much higher base herd immunity throughout country vaccines administered cases beginning decline, optimist says worst behind us. Still, lot unknowns, possible human behavior behind decrease hospitalizations cases, people let guards enough population vaccinated could see another surge. huge, everyone. Yeah we’re woods long covid keeps mutating ways make harmful. may eventually find way neutralize efficiently, may eventually mutate less harmful. big win. much Western world. problem controlled undeveloped 3rd world, new mutations evolve reduce efficacy vaccines even further. international trade &amp; travel matter months variants make way Europe US. important expedite rollout impoverished nations too, well keep updating theses vaccines, like flu shots. someone cherishes health (and experienced taken them), “likely” isn’t good enough. know 6 long haulers several people dealing long-lingering effects. Imma takes avoid that, friend give facebook post uncle. hour long youtube video time touring world. QC believes opposite. give pause? get Lambo, even option get it. months months. 

So yeah, guess might fraction people would rather lock 6-9 months waiting perfect option. far - FAR - people happily take good great later life return normal much sooner. isn’t much unfortunately , least see. Instagram page people comments still saying it’s experimental, won’t take it, etc. hopefully someone’s mind changed though Imagine hill die on! hope that’s case. feel like able get choice vaccine want. work closely people everyday would love best protection possible family friends. Err, yes. great vaccine prevents deaths severe illness, seem like would help stop spread long hauler. J&amp;J results also 85 percent effective preventing severe disease across regions studied, 28 days vaccination adults 18 years Efficacy severe disease increased time cases vaccinated participants reported day 49.
The Janssen COVID-19 vaccine candidate demonstrated complete protection COVID-related hospitalization death, 28 days post-vaccination.

So says 66%, 85%, sounds like 100%. different Moderna vaccine said 90% efficacy ""the majority adverse events mild moderate severity""? announcing people form agreement ""behind everyone's back""?

If clear would EU AZ contract. I'm mistaken even clause somewhere guaranteeing nothing known AZ could prevent fulfillment contract something like (I can't remember details).

So looks like UK pretended sharing, collaborative partner EU despite knowing exclusive contract back pocket, else AZ played EU. Either way they've played themselves. fact UK government made offer share doses means probably cahoots. 

The lawyers diplomats case vaccine cooperation probably finished now, shame. He’s really inspiring confidence president huge problem anti vaxxers Probably due stay home order. Rates falling consistently across vast majority states, varying degrees restrictions. probably likely bottom-level herd immunity kicking in. LA estimated ⅓ population infected now. fund Covax also donate spare vaccines.

I never suggested otherwise. saying disgusting buy vaccines excess let others suffer die, knowing need, donate vaccinated entire population. deplorable. Yep, vaccine highly effective, it’s enough keep infection rate among everyone else yet. people end hospital? No? 

Source? understanding quite people hospitals South Africa Manaus prior infection. I'm saying would personally take vaccine medical agency consider reputable approves (probably limited EMA/FDA/MHRA) people course welcome whatever want. would doubts agency approves product given 1 million people therefore must fine. no, research cite link.

 There's reason believe getting second vaccine effective, plenty people [contemplating multi-vaccine Good news you; you’d likely make without permanent lung damage regardless whether vaccines came existence not. thing mother. Multiple schools district shut two weeks hitting certain number cases. school lucky cases, there’s actually student grade (second) who’s ICU right that’s hitting close home us. I’m thankful she’s getting shot tomorrow, lie application health condition. 20 years studies said anything medical grade masks useless, could possibly vector transmission. never said masks anything. said cloth masks anything, exactly coming back now. Cloth masks ineffectual, mandated past 10 months. maddening. children children would fall 1B/C categories?

I’m curious general public able get it. gut later may. disagree all. nature, long term effects take quite accurately study. necessarily buy fearmongering, fact long term implications are, best 'unknown' enough keep extremely cautious. dog food mix line-caught caviar, oysters foie grois. gotta balancing act. takes minute break something takes months put back together. silver bullet big step towards getting it. long haul + mutations + caring people cannot get vaccinated health reasons need factor equation. economic reason, rightfully so. binary choice, never never &lt;2% hospitalized fully vaccinated.

Is good bad number? many fully vaccinated number caused. downside mRNA vaccines convincing people alter DNA hear bullshit. swear hear every day. 

No people, DNA read cell make mRNA blueprints cell uses make proteins. mRNA vaccine slips middle process cell grabs makes protein specifies (in case Covid spike protein). DNA touched. We're slipping extra work orders cell factories behind DNA's back (exactly viruses us, make one part instead whole virus). many get obvious illnesses, big carriers disease. Which, clue yet vaccine help with. definitely likely happen can't see happening Summer. Maybe late summer-early fall Thank you, need remind this. know anxiety excessive pushes knowledge risk low worry mainly long term issues. think maybe reframing similar flu help mentally. Lol. Cool. get one? I'll take it. layer Moderna Pfizer crunch past (I'm high risk, it'll worth ymmv).

Ah slightest clue talking about, confidently shouting opinion regardless. Cool. Here's hoping then! things cited specifically present people mild cases. stating vaccine make enduring symptoms present mild cases even less likely. I'm denying may case, hoping citation. could cost someone hundreds thousands pocket. could problematic return travel depending insurance go.

so happened?

if papers, GO BACK HOME.

because STATE want there.

quarantine leave.

&amp;#x200B;

...and test, state ***Hawai‘i accept*** Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) certified Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA) lab test results TRUSTED TESTING TRAVEL PARTNERS. **A negative COVID-19 test result required prior departure avoid quarantine Hawai‘i.** best, contract unclear, it’s stretch resolve EU’s favour. Clause 5.1 references EU relation initial order cover UK sites, pretty clear. Clause 5.4 issues drafting - it’s clear it’s intended permissive allow production UK, it’s talking additional doses (not initial doses). doesn’t clearly override 5.1. issues specification UK sites schedules don’t think that’s sufficient resolve EUs favour.

My strong suspicion drafted sides knowledge initial UK production going UK....

Finally, it’s pretty striking Commission trying conduct argument public statement. That’s good sign. fact made public claims literally false, even interpret contract EU’s favour.

So yes, talking bollocks. Why? Oh short term fully agree you. I'm thinking moving Fall / Winter, first phase vaccinating many people possible, focus remaining high-efficacy shots? school, we've two students die year part small subset student population going school in-building. COVID still rampant county. health department rep backpeddled recommendations HARD public outcry parents, we're going back case rate still 3 times original, recommended safe rate focused trend lines, case rate now.....totally ignoring variants, one dominant March. We're opening schools time variant roar student population. 

I predict close far ahead end school year. Hope I'm wrong. Yes don’t get logic either, anything gets us herd immunity good IMO. doubt it. AZ really got black eye. efficacy probably similar JandJ conduct AZ poor I'm guessing US avoid unless totally desperate. numbers general efficacy, efficacy ""severe"" disease was, — serious symptoms.

I'm referencing nuance, source thorough enough mention, another geographies, across variants, see 85% protection"" severe disease, said. trend increased time, severe cases vaccinated group day 49, according company.

The important thing that, South Africa, vaccinated population rarely stricken severe cases. That's super important, trial underway variant at-large. South Africa variant also specifically suspected resistant vaccines. UK/Brazil variants concerning, concerning vaccine-dodger.

It's weird play out, let's run it. Data clearly shows South African variant resistant vaccine, LOTS people get shot, variant may spread become dominant strains. Everyone might get COVID-19, hospitals overwhelmed, people die en-mass, etc. could still return normal.

I meant say, important. multiple variants multiple vaccines, future play exactly like this. However, taking variables here, see acceptable promising future ahead. full picture, data actually bright spot, negative one. People know they're talking saying this. Great idea want sinovac everywhere  Vaccine rollout actually going quite well. ideal, certainly feels bit slow, agonizing means given supply constraints have. culture tend multi-generational households, sadly lead inevitable deaths elderly Sure. knew 90% us going get vaccinated. I'm hoping get 70%. Even get covid help going hospital dying. good thing? Yeah, Hospitals important thing, keeping Schools open gotta number two. many facets society rely keeping open. Teachers school staff one top priorities.  far I'm aware used human virus there's potential people already exposed therefore immunity making vaccine ineffective tired zoom streams. watched 3 relatives funerals online. add fun: trials tested participants Covid-19 weekly, others tested people showing symptoms. 

I wonder US AstraZeneca trial due conclude soon testing regularly like trials showing symptoms? believe FDA requires latter. Regardless desperation, they're contractually obliged whole UK first exporting anyway. None grey-area ""best effort"" stuff, plain black white. Disagree. still able meet demands people already want vaccinate working class essential employees working class risk factors. Care explain moment promote vaccine already long line people want can't get it? american trial completes, yes. FDA accept data foreign trials EUAs. likelihood current vaccines, systemically administered, protect systemic manifestations disease regardless whether acute chronic. less likely protect entirely upper respiratory mucosal symptoms though upper resp. mucosa separate immune compartment needs tailored immune response necessarily come blood.

So words, may still get mild symptoms runny nose, congestion, sore throat, exposure virus chronic problems allude systemic ones unlikely.

Unfortunately though, PROVEN time (very similar optimistic reduction transmissibility proven time). guy gets ! really mean offence comment - comment laced extreme recency bias &amp; lack understanding.

The 90% efficacy mRNA vaccines super unprecedented, skewed average person’s perception ‘good’ vaccine is. Pfizer Moderna’s vaccines 70% would equally excited. actually really good news.  Another sign we’re targeting September “back normal” may actually mean it.  Well news good. Wow I’m wrong. Thanks. also going sister's opinion teaches actual high school poor school district, okay. read part wrote. think context matters willfully ignorant. thing people care numbers. one cares context, care grandma. that’s paying attention numbers thing meaningful. post hoc Monday morning quarter back interpretation events concluded America’s response bad use context explain bad. make assumptions let numbers speak. Maybe released Phase 2? J&amp;J released data today. I'd really surprised took long, given things looking US. J&amp;J online, vaccinations US complete end June. I'd surprised US start allowing exports Canada around even time. thought whole thing sending back school don’t get sick?  Weirdly would confident Novovax least know numbers vs SA variant. imagine 60% effective better. mean 60% vs SA good. AZ/Oxford JandJ vs vanilla virus. Still possible won’t go young. Kids age may need all. numbers say it’s exceedingly rare young children problems virus. doesn’t mean non-existent. rare. 3 year old. Covid went around house March issues all.  non risk age group member one probably getting positive goalpost shift sure, especially wake J&amp;J, perfect vaccine kids; largely don’t get severe disease run enough risk possibility get inoculated quickly, schools back fall Reopen? Florida 100% open months. Life already moved here, won’t get anywhere near vaccinated herd immunity without really excellent vaccines. 

A lot people won’t get vaccinated all, much less bother low efficacy vaccine. 

Our best shot stopping extremely effective vaccines like 50% care. 90 year olds barely make ICU, 75-80 year olds do

Vaccinating 90 year olds effect ICU capacity. seriously trying take completely literally defense?

damn. knew reddit could dense sometimes, but...wow.

Like not, it’s EU eliciting retaliatory response horrible PR. know, Czechia final decision always rests State Institute Drug Control. works EMA final authority drugs used within country. ....imagine that's Hawaii right now.

**The state Hawai‘i accept Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) certified Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA) lab test results TRUSTED TESTING TRAVEL PARTNERS. negative COVID-19 test result required prior departure avoid quarantine Lower efficacy means vulnerable idiots refuse vaccinate.

Not taking vaccine harmful society. Get vaccine eligible so. prevent “long COVID” complications? still seems like people get moderate case. release results? another trial? Likelihood socialize nebulous me- think anyone capable given circumstances. personally refrain danger pandemic, though engaged quite high contact situations. Presumably many college students same. Going trouble identify who's going around determining kind vaccine get feels inherently flawed, though could theory get control spread month two earlier otherwise. far stronger get doses arms quickly possible. shorting stock J&amp;J? yeah... maybe Moderna/Pfizer elderly J&amp;J non-elderly essential workers first. likely Moderna Pfizer first world developed countries J&amp;J developing areas.

When vaccine saves someone's life get fever, checking symptoms - well, bad, vaccine failed. gotcha! Thanks clearing up! idea. agree think it’s strange, I’m copying direct Johnson Johnson’s press release. seem  even get logic behind that, adenovirus vaccine creating mRNA vaccine body instead factory.

""Brexit Britain cannot allowed get ahead. must break law seize supplies catch up"". AZ/Oxford clearly thet reopened trial allowed complete. New York Times said [around 60 million end high error bars production schedule facing delays. US going move forward J&amp;J? know? isn’t either situation. people go hospital covid, tend die. old people overwhelmingly make covid hospital beds deaths. elderly vaccinated, hospital beds free death rate plummet simultaneously. 

And J&amp;J moot hospital bed shortage—that crisis time first person receives J&amp;J vaccine. Rates already plummeting nationwide, big percentage elderly least received first dose end next month.  balance child’s emotional health mental well being. 
I’m parent. know is. Recklessness, bad. Going playground, probably fine. ""No one saying thing""?! fact UK mainly what's prompting row EU UK currently happening.

The prime minister said positive tests immediately required quarantine designated government facilities make sure they’re carrying variants particular concern.

Trudeau also said government Canada’s main airlines agreed suspend service sun destinations right away. said Air Canada, WestJet, Sunwing, Air Transat cancelling air service Caribbean destinations Mexico starting Sunday April “They making arrangements customers currently trip regions organize return flights,” Trudeau said.

He said starting next week, international passenger flights must land following four airports: Vancouver, Toronto, Calgary “We also, coming weeks, requiring nonessential travelers show negative test entry land border US, working stand additional testing requirements land travel,” Trudeau said.

Canada already requires entering country self-isolate 14 days present negative COVID-19 test taken within three days arrival.

Tam, Canada’s top health official, said security contractors going door-to-door check returnees isolating home.

The move require hotel stay upon return would discourage vacations people would want quarantine hotel expense upon return.

“It’s excellent. It’s shame it’s late. something could done ages ago,” said Dr. Andrew Morris, professor infectious diseases University Toronto medical director Antimicrobial Stewardship Program Sinai-University Health “This definitely step right direction.”

More governments thinking ways aggressive new variants, delays vaccines, challenges getting population vaccinated strains health care systems.

Public Safety Minister Bill Blair said officials urging Canadians cancel nonessential travel trying eliminate ""Unfortunately, making choice engage nonessential travel. going make choice, bear full cost,” Blair said.

Trudeau also announced delay part next shipment Moderna vaccine, arrives next week. said Canada receive 78% expected amount, translating 180,000 doses.” That's first dose. side effects mainly immune response, second time exposed, stronger unpleasant. covid, seems common reports sore arm first dose mRNA covid vaccine, feeling like flu couple days second one. disease developed immunity that, stronger immune response first vaccine dose feel sicker. signed Novavax trial today. likely able get others trial anyway, harm I'm placebo group. disagree, live Stockholm (Söderort) since they've started recommending masks transit see lot people wearing them, even outside peak hours. Lots people street stores wearing well, lots care put following limits amount people allowed business, etc.

People still perfect wearing masks, lots under-the-nose wearers around, people bit cavalier even medical settings unfortunately (I've seen doctor couple times month kinda fussed mask discarding first time, plain wear second. even ask emergency room visit last month 😬). people getting better them!

As social distancing, there's marks floor people abide them, Stockholmers kinda sucked idea personal space even covid. guess fact I'm getting bumped street improvement? Kinda close people seem manage actual social distancing, haha. good side less effective vaccine suggests mRNA vaccines slap.

Except there's evidence less effective. Stop spreading FUD. subs usually don’t put much human aspect anything it’s always black white many sub yep

NYE month ago.. people die within 30 days. Clause 5.1 states ""Initial Europe doses"" (the first 300m) produced ""within EU"" 

Problem is, doses produced within EU exported EU, clear stockpiled delivery quoted ""Initial Europe doses"" think numbers great, especially mass produce them. would help flatten curve slow spread significantly. Even efficacy J&amp;J lower, still impressive number since originally hoping 50%. especially think younger people ""less risk"" hesitate get J&amp;J becomes available since still offers great amount protection speed path normalcy. would cause massive retaliatory response horrible UK PR. UK also find UK less important EU vice versa. It’s empty threat. It’s also unlikely reliant UK British tabloid headlines aside.

That’s two track system Oslo accords Palestinian authority given responsibility set Health ministry healthcare system separate ours. Arabs members Israeli healthcare system (Israeli Arabs East Jerusalem residents) access vaccine do.  JJ vaccine already much effective good flu vaccine.

I think flu shots like 40-45% good year. Hell ill take 66% get today done it. know get severe disease complications since 85 effective that. say 85% effective severe COVID-19, 100% effective eliminating hospital visits(from data) infection look like post vaccination? still sizable risk end long hauler receiving vaccine...well that’s great. find immune response enough ward long haul symptoms/post viral syndrome/whatever actually causing it, I’m 100% in. knows if/when data available. Seems coming around idea long haulers real thing psychosomatic. prevents severe illness that’s still massive, massive game changer. Especially given single-dose vaccine. What's difference in/out transition? Certainly, concern rather less months years many people catch SA variant. Sorry, European, know much pipeline ""buy American"". I`ll read that, thanks. mean, perfect.

Article continues Yep! plan moving forward.  Actually 50/50 shot, actually.... Shit, right. can't argue that. Exactly. Thank correcting misinformation reddit. actual contract like guy instead pushing vaccine war Brexiteer propaganda. Pfizer reported 1 severe infection, one volunteers oxygen drop 90%. 0 hospitalizations, J&amp;J seem regard. Gotta tested though. That's point. can't test positive tested. J&amp;Js data mess US data inconsistent South African data. Approve approve none. Nah Biden gonna fuck us longer buy American executive order cancelling already mostly built pipeline (that imo built first place). said subreddit. 

I’m sorry, doomscrolling taking extreme pessimistic position everything doesn’t anything stop virus. doesn’t help community. fact, I’d say harms community. 

You aren’t even aware half country living. You’re completely blind subreddit. 

You don’t get it. doesn’t click you. forgot important part. schedule (the manufacturing facilities used):  substance manufacturing \[…\] (FR/BE), \[…\] (I/IL), \[…\] (UK) \[…\] (UK). \[…\] (ITL). \[…\].**  product manufacturing \[…\] (ITL), \[…\] (DE), \[…\] (UK) potential suppliers.** People already trying downplay J&amp;J vaccine numbers. 

I say sign hell already. I’d take today move life. 5.1 include UK. 5.4 *include UK EU 5.4 only*

That means AZ allowed produce doses UK EU without asking commission (5.4), best effort require UK according 5.1.

The sentence Schedule includes redacted words, annex contradicts contract, guess judge decide (usually contract deemed important annexes).

They fire whoever wrote contract. all. prior admin take seriously plan distribute vaccines. Biden admin remedied failures. wife teaching person school year. school’s contact tracer didn’t even notify one students always 1on1 close contact tested positive. didn’t send students home either. parent sent daughter wife’s class school despite girl’s brother forced quarantine due positive test. community doesn’t care. 
Somehow “haven’t” gotten it. 90% sure asymptomatic extremely mild it. two day period migraine felt awful migraine sufferer thought nothing it. Looking back, around time students close coworkers getting Covid. 

While teachers deserve vaccine, I’m sure many would go get it. wife’s school filled republican teachers claiming whole thing rushed, wasn’t tested, changes dna, etc.. 
My wife I’s concern hasn’t really much testing affects pregnant women there’s really way see affects fertility. want kids soon may avoid vaccine then. That's EMA sitting ass approving vaccines. Even ones approved (Pfizer/Moderna) getting distributed quickly. live EU I’m afraid doesn’t make good reading. It’s grim story mismanagement vanity cost lives. probably fine younger populations risk countries proper logistical infrastructure mRNA, want shot high risk individual 55 since seems mRNA vaccines robust.

I think writing wall announced going testing two shot variant also announced production lower anticipated. ***The Janssen COVID-19 vaccine candidate demonstrated complete protection COVID-related hospitalization death***, 28 days post-vaccination. clear effect vaccine COVID-19 cases requiring medical intervention (hospitalization, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)), reported cases among participants received Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, 28 days post-vaccination.

The thing truly matters. protects going hospital dying, effectively turning COVID ""just flu"" worst case scenario. I'm ready put veins. 50% traditional benchmark decent vaccine. one higher even South African variant, prevented hospitalizations. Plus stored refrigerator distributed single shot. Personally think it’s perfect rural areas places aren’t exactly hotspots. Even Pfizer even claim that. don’t think ever vaccine 90% effective respiratory disease love (huge) backyard (aka AUS). Plenty explore see. 64 year old father-in-law got vaccination today (UK).. he's clinically vulnerable. got vaccine slot unplanned extra availability. UK aim get 5 priority groups vaccinated Feb 15. Yep, P2 trials antibody response peaked 57 days shot P3 trial looked efficacy 28 days plus. 

It's possible actual efficacy longer term little better reporting here. titers wild-type virus detected 90% participants day 29 first vaccine dose (geometric mean titer [GMT], 224 354), regardless vaccine dose age group, reached 100% day 57 increase titers (GMT, 288 488) cohort issue oxfords much fucking mess study data is, much efficacy live EU I’m afraid doesn’t make good reading. It’s grim story mismanagement vanity cost lives. I.. don’t want it. know even moderate cases still long-term negative effects. shot keeps hospital still might able walk 50ft without getting winded months? don’t like it. you’ve mentioned lawyer said best efforts also don’t even cover deliveries. say would overaction would putting mildly. Also pointless. variants help prop theoretical models doomsday scenarios never realized, thus keeping population large sufficiently scared. making rash assumptions I'm sorry, USA, Canada Europe keep hoarding every single fucking vaccine can't help export covid mutations guys.

We vaccine 1% population, expect variations soon. Misleading. Vaccines prevent infections, reduce severity infection. also prevent transmissions. Also, incidence highly dependent testing rates. People horribly spoiled Pfizer Moderna results. UK vaccinated 60-70% efficacy vaccine. single dose prevents 100% hospitalizations deaths excellent. Ok doses they've contracted deliver. Specifically doses manufactured EU. what's point? contract require vaccine made EU UK. UK-EU relations unchanged. whole drama still EU AZ. Flu vaccination right 70% H N combinations accounted for.

With strains bypassing effectiveness vaccines yet fully developed communities, vaccines dipping 50's.

What happens strains less effective become dominant strains among vaccinated populations, think? post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* messaging changed “masks important” “masks even important now”. I’m afraid don’t anything good say intellect anyone finds confusing hypocritical. That's exact opposite contract says. Clause 5.1 says EU initial doses must come EU factories. Thank Efficacy Oxford vaccine, US approves J&amp;J must also approve Oxford vaccine immediately. 2021  confusing ""the vaccine 100% effective hospitalizations death trial"" ""the vaccine 100% effective hospitalizations death administered general public"". trial claimed former, one claiming latter (except implying did). think Even still, guess follow 2 dose cohort show high efficacy, eventually making 2 dose. Nah. see cases, hospitalizations deaths. isn’t accurate. 

It “hoped” vaccines could effective flu vaccines. vaccine much effective. 

The casual public got confused new technology pushed first two vaccines incredible effectiveness.  “Only” 85% wrong? far less effective. Obviously awesome since cheap one shot, plenty people shop dollar store deal people already covid? 70% single dose really really good feeling going turn many British people EU. Stupid move part EU IMO. Cool. Thanks! I’m actually mostly referring ultra orthodox neighborhoods Arab towns definitely receiving vaccinations Israel proper. issue Arab locations there’s lot distrust vaccine. hospitlisation key bit here. mean mind getting ill keeps hospital win book. another link date stamped article? saying it’s true phrase “Cluster 5” sounds worrifying. deal people covid already? Got it. Thank you! think that's good news. Make billion make another billion. Wow, staying informed considered fearful world. Noted. not? 1-dose titers pretty low There’s difference one dose boosters. many months, years get booster. You’ve described supply chain problem  Yeah flu vaccine 39% effective last year, 29% that, 19% years trending downwards 10 said, 66% J&amp;J vaccine good but... would nice higher. Somewhere, think Chicago, toying idea threatening teacher's credentialing daring disobey potential return work order. Effectively, destroying career. J&amp;J studying effects vaccine given two doses two months apart, results trial won’t available summer, Stoffels said Name countries higher testing rates US inside EU. 27 member states.  right course. People seem completely missed point. translation article?  I’m pretty sure family members hospital COVID.  We'll see J&amp;J prevents hospitalizations among older people 100% time. I'm 2 dose trial I'm getting 2nd dose 13 February probably going awhile trial everyone else, then. Hope end hospital waiting doses, vaccine (thus far) 100% effective preventing. 2 million doses available. best J&amp;J lead moderate increase number people vaccinated. silver bullet. Incorrect. single shot stored shipped freezer units. Reactions like much worse news results, 66% effective one shot extremely good news. swedes hide things. WOW falling really low.

The question is, sweden get away it, buses, supermarkets, shops, coffeshops nobody wearing masks rest world suffering harsh lockdowns imposed face masks.

I know swedes hide stuff evidence becoming much clearer.

So far proof wrong keep diverting attention. low efficacy gonna scare lot people vigilant longer waiting second generation vaccine. 

Is good bad thing? Depends ask probably. sure downvoted. one big concerns too. Preventing near term hospitalizations huge vaccines don’t prevent long term organ damage know occur even asymptomatic COVID cases we’re still trouble. Nothing. stay home usually problem. they're old enough understand slack home may graduate. main issue middle school under. Perfect example problem New York Times editorialize emotional reaction headlines. two news article titles story. first NBC News. second NYTimes:

NBC: ""J&amp;J says vaccine effective Covid, though weaker South Africa variant""

This headline statement facts. problem.

NYTimes: ""Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Vaccine Offers Strong Protection Fuels Concern Variants""

This headline implying feel, implying fear worry necessary response, potentially incorrectly implying vaccine might work variant. I'm edge canceling subscription. time everything, COVID. Tell news, feel it. Occam's: simplest explanation probably correct one. prevent hospital trip.

It prevent 85% hospital trips. normal situation, vaccine much worse ones already exist would never get approval. guess we’ll find desperate US doses set aside us. I'm EU. I'm telling argument first reaction “its far early death rate stats”.

On reading site you’ve linked, yeah right - it’s estimate 2020 taken mid year. actual count.

Official statisticians tend slow. Check back June maybe. Moderna/Pfizer 2 shot efficacy caused this--I would imagine efficacy 1 shot Moderna/Pfizer would demonstrate something similar compared J&amp;J heard gotta compare Sweden rest scandinavia, rest world. Explain. Yeah felt bad ran fever second shot. happiest I’ve ever sick!! Strange times we’re living in! least back statements instead blindly loving everything JT does.
BTW I'm liberal hater. gave Trudeau pandemic response. Failing get vaccines timely manner epic failure, fucking nonsense. clearly says ""Best Reasonable Efforts manufacture"". Still game changer considering it’s one shot able stored normal temperature. “Hmm, Yes agree. Shallow pedantic.” actually prevented need hospitalization death 100% time, isn’t ultimately want? think moderna/Pfizer vaccine given elderly people health conditions rest young, healthy population given J&amp;J one drive pandemic ground. Ah okay still strange specify EU UK, UK EU anymore Thanks link. Definitely interesting frightening read. Often virus mutates becomes infectious less deadly. uk variant deadly infectious good. Exactly right. 

18-55 J&amp;J
55 older Moderna Pfizer we're gonna die, cool seems case, since don’t hear coming US supply Pfizer, even though that’s hit road block too. vaccine actually approved also, AZ one isn’t yet. 

Seems like playing game politics UK AZ, we’re usual ‘bad guys’ easy try pick on. Pfizer unscathed however, moderna, who’s announced similar EU delays. Wonder two dose trial conclude. Maybe sooner typical trial efficacy vs safety, one dose trial proved safe- although theory 2 doses could unique safey issue. know wait vaccines rather settle 66%. released first everyone would talking miracle is. 

Pfizer Moderna spoiled us 😂 Clubbing mask sounds miserable. That's hilarious. crushing shit. Covid stay around while. unless western countries somehow jump 300k deaths, dead last runnings. Yeah think should. nothing. could perfectly lying. 

From personal experience videos posted say telling truth. approved March available Q2... EU demanding UK's supply vaccines would also lead deaths got way clear case. arguments people 65+ still get it. 

For example many older people confined home, logistically challenging schedule visit vaccinate them. single shot option may still great them. 

I doubt formal restrictions reservations codified FDA certain age group. Hahaha  need testing. I’m sure what’s gone wrong there. We’ll see happens. I’ve reading bit past hour I’m confused.

I’ve heard EU intending block AZ vaccinations exported (since apparently sent EU UK before).

I’ve heard EU fucked AZ required give doses made Dutch &amp; Belgian locations.

I’ve also heard AZ trouble listed UK supply locations, means they’ve signed incompatible contracts UK EU, means signed bad faith.

I’ll stop armchair stuff leave lawyers judges. Like 500k doses, basically nothing headline lie. 66% effective SYMPTOMATIC illness 85% effective SEVERE illness. post needs removed. evidence blocking transmission get it, poor reading it. experts suspect vaccines block transmission extent, maybe half 1/3rd mild symptoms spread it, even less. Certainly them. doctors saying that?  Well be, nice thread provide insight/context: Lol is. order even so. agree EU messed badly approval. UK got doses equally distributed UK EU fair. approval EU, EU get 60% less doses fair. Stop hospitalisations virus, probably biggest geopolitical event since ww2, becomes bad flu going around. 1 dose. Easily stored. over. Yeah and? It’s 66% efficacy stop getting Covid. however 100% effective reducing symptoms eliminating death. example appeasement? (Since OP answer question asked)

Because see legislators sides thr aisle dunking hedge fund managers. True. I’m probably concerned even mild case people. chronic nerve pain condition know quite people got “mild” covid cases made pain exponentially worse Oxford immediately approved then, correct? Honda Civic vaccines. could better still car. Mutation random. Weaker stronger. random. selective pressure make virus less deadly spreads more. escape vaccines etc. still random. Yea idk people will. People already skeptical take vaccine. finally convince give KIA instead Lamborghini Ferrari, may say fuck I’ll wait good stuff. sure getting downvoted. KC Tampa issuing warnings residents would expect gatherings places possibly even big regional spike (and also cities US, lesser extent). Reasonably effective, safe. game changer, great wide use - save Moderna vulnerable. Ah yes, ""just find people"" - genius! I'm sure one thought that. run government!  Treatment requires medical personnel plus resources like drugs equipment.  one cover Well that's hypocritical. Seals big whiskers. **The statistics show number people Sweden died Covid-19. That's everyone died testing positive virus; mean virus cause death cases.**

Sweden gets data system social security numbers (personnummer) means deaths registered centralised system. Public Health Agency check regions (in Sweden individual regions responsible healthcare) deaths people coronavirus -- course, possible deceased people tested virus.

This different countries report death tolls. countries France also include deaths nursing homes, [a change made April 2nd. countries, including Spain, Italy England, currently include deaths take place inside hospitals official tolls.

The EU publicly kicking biggest shitstorm possible distract failings, Brexit Britain public enemy number 1 best target get emotions riled up. much targeting UK. actual difference UK supplies could make EU shortfall absolutely tiny. PR. Illness disease different things clinically. 62% effective making test positive pcr test - i.e. infection. 99% effective developing symptoms Covid-19. i.e. virus take hold enough body suffer.

The US question veracity trial way. trial small required ethnic diversity US approval requires (not many Native Americans UK example). Yes EU could that, although bit cheeky they've let countries depend e.g.. Canada.

UK upfront start UK produced vaccines go UK first one planned vaccine production mind least start. That's fair. 3 months draft contract. course going mistakes.

Rapidly scaling vaccine production though something happen flawlessly. vaccine good enough risk groups old people, people, covid numbers game: millions young people individually low risk add many hospitalisations long covid. Reduce number severe cases 0 young people pretty much k begin with. get bad flu whatever.

And also reduces chance bad flu 2/3.

You’ll need look underlying data even attempt good comparison prevention mild cases. There’s data support That's great point. looks like used different endpoints.

From week researchers Butantan Institute, conducting trials Brazil, announced vaccine 78% efficacy ""mild-to-severe"" Covid-19 cases.  Tuesday revealed calculations figure include data group ""very mild infections"" among received vaccine require clinical assistance.  inclusion data, efficacy rate 50.4%, said researchers.

From study, definition severe COVID-19 disease included laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 one following: signs consistent severe systemic illness, admission intensive care unit, respiratory failure, shock, organ failure death, among factors.

Feel good story. would show pajamas too! 

When education mad world shortcomings least place feel like belong...anti vaxers, flat earthers, etc.

1 told would last 3 months. Ugh, hope doesn’t last June. got placebo, long wait. Nurses cleaning covid rooms. I’d argue it’s still occurring. parasite brain’s populace. Fueling anger resentment lead horrible 2nd wave March. 

Plus CDC saying: 
* “Double masks!”

Also CDC: 
* “Kids don’t get SARS-CoV-2! virus leaves body quicker!” 

So stock prepare whatever want believe. I’d rather wrong right instance. big question is: J&amp;J supply come big enough numbers pfizer/moderna still lagging. 

If J&amp;J arent coming good numbers April pfizer/moderna opened general population, might well wait pfizer/moderna high risk (and point, everyone whos high risk already access it) Also prevents hospitlisation Regarding COVID-19 hospitalisation (WHO Severity grading ≥4) 0 (0.0%; N=5,258) cases COVID-19 hospitalisation participants received two doses COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca (≥15 days post dose 2) compared 8 (0.2%; N=5,210) control, including one severe case (WHO Severity grading≥6), reported control. participants received least one dose, 22 days post dose 1, 0 (0.0%, N=8,032) cases COVID-19 hospitalisation participants received COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca, compared 14 (0.2%, N=8,026), including one fatality, reported control.

Basically 100 % protection severe illness hospitalization, based limited data far. clinical research ongoing, lot data US UK coming. Yeah do. data Israel show mRNA numbers hold 2 doses? think UK strain dominant Exactly. I've never caught covid yet, I'm pretty sure I'm sitting 0% efficacy. Pump 66 directly veins right today, later year I'll also take 95er they're readily available. threat stop, notice limited supply.

Very different things.

A threat stop would be: 'If X make sure never get Y'.

Not: 'Sorry, many deliver moment'. Someone said Monday. watch career great interest.

No, lawyer, believe anything write, anybody else. look yourself.

I've said before, section 5.4 relevant whole contract, including section 5.4. title section literally ""Manufacturing sites"". Whenever ""EU"" mentioned wrt manufacturing sites, includes UK, that's **purpose** section 5.4. purposes relating manufacturing sites, ""EU"" means EU-27. I’m sure everyone jumping joy. People already skeptical vaccines you’re going push one vastly inferior them? People going say fuck wait 95% ones anything. 

It’s like walking car dealership people getting Lamborghini Ferrari price they’re offering KIA.

If anything really used extremely low risk individuals. elderly high risk demanding provided two vaccines currently have. making best reasonable effort manufacture doses (including initial ones) various sites, including sites UK. using UK sites deliver according schedule ""best reasonable effort"". Why? BioNtech vaccines delivered outside US made far inside EU.

All doses UK, Israel, Canada got made EU. can’t said last week planned cut initial deliveries EU 31 million doses 80 million due reduced yields manufacturing plants Europe. know high-risk people ages 16-64 towards back priority list live, behind essential workers, they’re expecting able get vaccine closer May. I’m wondering would consider using J&amp;J vaccine young, healthy essential workers use mRNA shots higher-risk, older essential workers. that, would save mRNA vaccine 16-64 higher risk folks, hopefully allow get vaccinated earlier. also see ease colleges community centers set huge vaccination drives J&amp;J vaccine. Yeah especially considering J&amp;J isn’t ramping really April Im single live alone. havent hugged anyone since March 6,2020. cant wait get back dating over!

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I’m assuming Europe don’t mean UK believe track return normal time, even earlier US vaccination 0.5 100 every day. like Amit Shah (is) busy organising rallies thousands attendance. think politicians give rat's ass public, think again. purely political all.  think pretty clear meant. Long haul covid patients exactly secret. UK ban exports vaccines. Also UK gifted vaccine world cheap possible make it. Sure thing. recent numbers mid January likely still aftermath effects holiday season. like post thanksgiving pre xmas well Yes, recommendations restrictions wearing masks? That's comes AZ asked approval 16 days ago.  definitely disagree one caring masks Sweden. frequently see masks Skåne. Still majority though, far from. Sucks hear bad Stockholm Well vaccine needs raw materials (the Pfizer one) coming U.K. EU stars blocking vaccines exported U.K., U.K. could block raw materials couldn’t even make vaccines anymore. 

I think EU shooting foot. 16 days AZ asked approval? isn’t emergency approval, AZ fully liable. might want recheck that, article contains absolutely mention threat AZ stop deliveries.

It contain spokesman AstraZeneca said meeting company “committed even closer coordination jointly chart path delivery vaccine coming months continue efforts bring vaccine millions Europeans profit pandemic.” I've seen lot investigation, comments, mRNA vaccine effectiveness first dose focus Pfizer's vaccine, far line roughly 50% effectiveness expected. However, often times, understandably people assume applies moderna vaccine well - I've seen actual data moderna 80+% effective first dose: actually collected data people received one dose of its vaccine, Gill says. 2,000 participants Moderna’s phase three clinical trial received single injection either placebo vaccine. population, efficacy single vaccine dose roughly 80 90%.  shy showing single dose effective, math right,"" Gill says. “After 14 days, \[single dose\] vaccine remarkably effective.”  


Which, think may part big push try one shot. possible higher initial dose given moderna could cause difference, likely subjects 1 dose trial? great news many stupid selfish people think liberty freedom means they're allowed whatever want without regard people. New Zealand Australia crushed even close advantage fully vaccinated populace. still locked stand virus vaccinate populations.  I’m willing isolate bit longer better outcome.

That fine others get ahead less desired vaccine. study, pages 159-161 think.


According methods, severe category symptoms basically defined symptoms; requires bed rest results loss work, school"" etc.


Whereas ""potentially life threatening"" category similarly consistent criteria several symptoms: unable perform basic self care functions""


So, bedridden, also struggling breathe, eat/drink.


Honestly, though, would think people differentiate serious critical/life threatening symptoms family member, unless clinical experience medicine.


TLDR: ""serious"" cases according study mean patient temporarily bedridden / unable function, recover without hospitalization. Kerry Washington great actress. She’s memeified. wife March. 
What we’re injecting conversation much (me included times) vaccine keeping hospital chances high it’s fighting lingering effects. Definitely would choose. got Moderna thru employer (essential mental health worker) side-effects all, sore arm injection site (which expected intramuscular injection). team members experienced mix headaches, body aches, dizziness day booster (2nd dose). medical personnel conducting vaccinations said possible symptoms would onset 12 hours post injection (if all), clear within 24 hours.

I mention I've heard many people making big deal potential symptoms Moderna vaccine they're minimal. Everyone know whose experienced said absolutely worth feeling little crappy day stay vent. no-brainer. time last 24hours, news France.

eta : threatened deliver *a quarter* agreed per contract. anyone else read “Tyler Perry Gets Covid-19 TV Reassure Black Skeptics” ? see would seem unfair able choose best vaccine receive, thing effective vaccine realistically going available fair amount time still. probably likely end getting covid time unvaccinated waiting one choice took 60-70% effective one now. Also, fact works single dose vaccine makes much better strategic way large numbers people getting one, effectively doubling rate immunization compared now. matter 1st approved, 2nd delivered.

Theoretical vaccines actual vaccines. sound kinda unhinged. okay friend? US recently hit level vaccinations past 2 weeks too. Canada basically running 2 weeks behind us vaccination ramp up.

And 24k low, population Canada 1/10th US, much spread out. hope get data weeks UK. people younger 65 get it. already appointment March... see line reasoning regarding Clauses 5.1 5.4, thoughts says Schedule A? Clause 5.4 notes manufacturing site planning set Schedule A, within schedule, appears talking Initial Europe Doses, outlines ""Drug substance manufacturing"" ""Drug product manufacturing"" sites included UK. 

I understand it’s Clause 5.1 states Initial Europe Doses manufactured EU, it’s purposes Clause 5.4 EU includes UK. However, Clause 5.4 still talks manufacture Initial Europe Doses, discusses AZ’s “intention manufacture Initial Europe Doses and/or Optional Doses Agreement EU”, noted, Clause 5.4 considers UK part EU. It’s (seeming) inconsistency, UK manufacturing sites included seems like schedule Initial Europe Doses, makes matter seem less clear me. 

Feel free correct I’m misinterpreting though. Lol. Same. 

We paid debts besides house even extra money coming in. would normally like ""Let's stay watch movie honey"". 

After over? Let's go conservatory! Oh $75 two people.....I fucking care! take road trip dog rent cabin 2 states over.... expensive say? Living box fear expensive mental health.... blowing $700 easy. 

The US gonna explode shit over. Nope think better flu shot. effective new strains. give two really matters, it. basically brings everything level, going hospitalized cold, going cold like symptoms any. I'd rather others, maybe give people 40 something. seems extremely wasteful PPE race nations, speed important allow herd immunity take place minimum casualties prevent resistance well allowing economic recovery. UK going full steam ahead AZ vaccine, even perfect. ideal world we'd enough mRNA vaccines, real world preventing hospitalisation death key. yet, commitment DELIVER 81 mil doses. best effort applies too. EU buying, example, 12 Emt6000-x2 machines used 11.5h per day, whatever. buying finished product ready use. producing sourcing concern producer. 

Show product. 57% effective Brazilian strain, already present Absolutely. send 100 million doses third world. contract looks bad Commission, even sure arguments even point. AZ's position seems like slam dunk initial binding orders contract crystal clear,"" Mrs von der Leyen said Friday morning's radio interview. 

&amp;#x200B;

:-| amazing little leadership do. would take one Moderna 95 lmao think mean ""crushing covid"" achieving herd immunity via vaccination + infections. Australia NZ certainly virus control, remain highly vulnerable unable reopen borders without risking losing control. Seems like stretch me. also Commission arguing. Oh agree you, I've saying April turning point now, makes pretty hard people deny ending relatively near future.  would total overreaction likely unconstitutional. 72% good enough, especially compared Pfizer Moderna. also says ""to deliver EU distribution hubs following market approval"". Could AZ say needed start delivering vaccine approved? saying media publishes irresponsible headlines clicks one reads article? shocked 😲!  understand, yields process AZ uses create vaccine vary wildly can't guaranteed. Anyone vaccine manufacturing knowledge back up? shaving increases risk infections since get microcuts since beard harbors healthy bacteria keeps infectants out. actually opposite keeping beard safer. wanted add argument wonder go EUA single two dose trials wait 2nd trial Barely. good enough. Travel, knowing yet know could carrying virus take appropriate precautions people still vaccinated (ie: mask, avoid spending time indoors unmasked unvaccinated people unless they're willing take risk) Probably good idea come  Grady made! make sense you? WP headline says 66% effective, marginally effective Moderna Pfizer one dose.  57% effective Brazilian variant already rapidly spreading US.

Why give two doses? One dose seems marketing ploy medically sound Nice. think far none vaccines led hospitalization  worthy covid illness yet correct? Yeah first vaccine gate media spin would quite different. I’m sure, maybe it’s possible definition severe illness varies depending ask? I’d love clarification well. know past year I’ve seen characterizes anything treat home mild anything sends hospital severe.  evidence Pfizer/Moderna provide better protection vs African strain compared J&amp;J either vaccine vaccine. wait fall want RNA one, think that's smart idea. use everything stop pandemic asap.

Btw, testing vaccine two doses too. Results expected 2-3 months. may actually get \~90% effective booster later. Can't say US, live Sweden. like running experiment, setup group alter one variable see effect. Three groups Sweden, Denmark, Norway. Variable 'do wear masks not'. Although scientific anyway, one say countries. exactly expert, requires one dose would course (if everything else equal) twice easy. 
Also, least said themself track deliver numbers given out. pretty high. 
If can't deliver volume promise, course becomes different issue. would need wear mask vaccinated? done before? normal summer ALREADY sight Pfizer Moderna. speed weeks. even enough arms put 100 million vaccines into. invariably going end donated another country. 44,000-person study, vaccine prevented 66% moderate severe cases Covid-19, according company statement Friday. particularly effective stopping severe disease, preventing 85% severe infections 100% hospitalizations deaths. antibiotics made fight bacterial infections (not contagious except Staphylococcus), they're definitely highly infectious virus strains global pandemic. third time New South Wales completely eliminated virus.

I've 'crushed smoking' much way. believe there's not. use google translate, usually good job I’m rooting outcome would think would change lot people’s minds antivax crowd getting sick whittled basically people cannot get vaccine doe medical reasons. shot means you’ll get nothing worse cold, what’s issue? want never sick again? I’ve checked it’s measured half Swedens measures absurdly overrated:


School closings - Sweden rates high DK higher Norway. far reality. older grades closed briefly there’s protective measures open schools. 

Public events - Sweden rates high DK NO. reality implemented restrictions much later neighbours. 

Protection elderly - Sweden rates high higher DK despite SE claiming single failure statistically DK best results three countries (though possibly changed since December?).

Travel controls - Sweden rates high DK higher NO. absurdly far reality. Sweden much lenient neighbours. “risk countries” Sweden currently banning entry U.K., Dk NO. Despite two latter considerably less cases, hospitalisations deaths per capita per day. 

Testing - Sweden rates high despite positivity rates 10x higher.

Contact tracing - Sweden rates high DK despite generally leaving positive cases tracing close contacts 24 hours symptoms.



Compare countries ratings pretty clear Oxford Stringency Index difficulties dealing Sweden’s half assed recommendations official claims ex. TTI super duper. They’ve targeted 1B doses 2021 witness firepower fully armed operational vaccine! Fire commander! case influenza? think good year flu vaccine 60% effective, yet keeps transmission pretty low. aged like wine. merck tell us? Could big deal?  Sucks you.  Whichever approved one State give me...it's me. im wearing double cloth mask long enough cover all, basically like mask cowboy bandit would wear movie. built metal wire mold around nose, way gaps really closed off. also covers ears way air come passing mask It’s embarrassing they’re telling something actions. Pay attention that? wonder long would left expired made months ago enough vaccines. use less effective vaccines, thousands die make effective vaccines.

Trade future deaths current deaths... current deaths wins. approved within week maybe two emergency basis (like others). expect 100 million doses delivered US June.

Hopefully distribution issues resolved timely manner. 100% hospitalization. U.K. could block Oxford exporting AZ manufacturing plants EU to.

If UK I'm favor blocking exports food Pfizer vaccine UK. we'll see power. 600k dead JNJ stuff good shit, guys.

“A single-shot J&amp;J Janssen COVID19 vaccine phase 3 results summarized one table. Great news! Imagine 100% protected death 28 days single shot, 100% protected severe disease 49 days - UK trusts NHS regulator quite implicitly experience. Anti vaxx nonsense rise super significant. 30% still getting mild case mean 30% transmitting disease, although that's common misconception here. Clause 5.4 talking manufacture use plants outside EU. using plant outside EU manufacture AZ needs give written notice explanation why. AZ unable deliver intention supply vaccine EU present addtional sites AZ use.

For purpose clause, clause only, UK EU. means AZ need inform EU produces UK. 

Clause 5.1 initial dose states made EU, mention UK. 100 million June, silver bullet right means normal (and safe) summer sight. Yeah literally time essential objective right prevent hospitalizations. Preventing deaths among 90 year olds seems like good idea, hospitals scaling back care whole population we're letting health issues claim thousands lives later that's unethical hell. 

Get hospitals empty first, bring death rates. Fuck that, want best vaccine get. Especially considering new strains. Genuine question: Don’t two-dose vaccines similar efficacy J&amp;J’s first two doses? smoking? global health community rejoicing this. larger scope things pandemic... no. ends one parents. I'm fence... See arguments. course that's one I'm offered sooner Moderna/pfizer, yeah, I'll take it. irrational may be, I'm going feel protected anxiety go much get JJ vaccine. going wait, can't control feel. terms Merkel allys, he's nobody. That's made statement. ally Merkel would never said without beeing sanctioned Merkel. Lol literally worst example handle it. true call western nation. Maybe read wrong refer Australia NZ two islands? 

Last checked Australia continent, happens sixth largest country world. see that? see 66% number ""moderate severe"" 85% number ""severe"" alone.

*When looking severe cases, J&amp;J said vaccine 85% effective across regions studied, 28 days vaccination.* showing visual proof statement 50% people use masks bus?. none!.

Why swedes keep lying actual situation sweden entire world lockdown forced masks?. would become obvious country nothing prevent covid giving recommendations nobody follows, real measures would face masks supermarket, buses, restaurants?. severe illness require hospitalization, stop 85% severe illnesses, 100% hospitalizations? You’re wrong, pointing expectations come from. people don’t consider variables data, know know... that’s right (in US least) two vaccines available publicize 95% efficacy. So... vaccine getting?  I'm super hyped J&amp;J vaccine, yes effective, probably vaccine getting healthy college student health complications

This significantly boost vaccinations efforts, 100 million vaccines(100 million people) april think said. Novovax, think, did.

They found 60% efficacy right around non-HIV positive participants SA variant. even lower overall due HIV positive participants, given high prevalence SA.

I believe J&amp;J may ground data now. It’s novavax trial said earlier.  No, Asia Times did, idiot That's clearly untrue followed pandemic know, I've borderline suicidal lately. I'm happy able read something like British lives? rest world?

It seems European lives matter you. makes someone long haul? first verified case barely year ago next week, north korea says vaccine 200% effective 😂😂 one model. Go CDC’s website download Death forecast. multiple models top think tanks. average prediction June 30 1M deaths. model probably assuming mass vaccinations variants. Even VA’s health department updated predicting 500k, 1.2M projected, 3M cases 1/24-7/11 new variants. Even assuming 2% thats 10-60k deaths. good majority states experience similar fluctuations, makes sense. Yes they'll go rich countries first. would case matter what. Poor countries place queue least get free. though. Thank-you think Yes. 1000000% yes. fucking again

This time shall named isn’t blame According ministry Health 305 hospitalized good condition. don’t know circumstances hospitalizations. EU restricts export vaccines start pointless trade war no-one wants best times let alone current situation find in

We're already mostly back normal months. 

While leak hotel quarantine pressing threat something four states already dealt result complete elimination.

Australia far side moon. bringing back thousands Australian citizens week months. 

The ""OMG, one case Australia done !!!1"" bullshit. New South Wales came lockdown June 10 ish new cases day eliminated it. Got reinfected Victorian outbreak. took four months eliminated without going back lockdown.

Had leak hotel quarantine Christmas. four weeks new reinfection also 12 days new cases.

People treating kind cavalier attitude dangerous. much Pfizer Moderna's 90+ efficacy Purchased delivered. It’s stupid question. Public health professionals done shamefully bad job walking people personalized risk levels like this. think aren’t focused day day life instead think mostly worst elements worst off. common sense answer tour question reinfection incredibly rare, possibility still able transmit far unknown. likelihood, people already infected immune shouldn’t worry also carrying fairly low risk lifestyle. Unfortunately, haven’t studies providing data back common sense. matters british lives, yes. Ahh is. Took days write “but here’s it’s good enough” piece Israel. Oxford botched experimental process, many people hesitating approving them, US making another trial. EU approved either.  crazy much varies. city, masks fairly common one's ever looked weird wearing one US opening soon? sure- different states, different strategies. anticipate happens states, it’s based supply demand. imagine mRNA become gold standard day US it’s effective. certainly right picky, you’re competing everyone else want right may well waiting game time refuse get anything mRNA vaccine. way J&amp;J it’s easy make transport, it’s one shot it’s super convenient. 

Getting protection severe outcomes death good trade waiting Pfizer/moderna, IMO. 

Also, shouldn’t get penalized, depends insurance/health system. They’ll study sooner later comparing vaccines one another. There’s good chance they’re comparable people treating this. Yeah, restrictions, find manufacturer available, please mass purchase hoard them...

I bought mine Bielcor. No, saying everyone getting doses placed orders pace. admitting rest world get Pfizer Moderna vaccines rich countries vaccinate lol. I'm surprised see issue that.  No, gunk comes Alabama. overall Germany. would've happy first half 2020 knew 66% effective vaccine soon  Russia track vaccinate 60% adults H1. think Belgium EU capital bad position pandemic. People continent world meeting make politics lobby. People certainly care less lots countries, *a lot* reddit, example, would make think. know, hospitalized means condition definitely mild. Also, ill long enough us know severe condition actually going get. Hopefully get worse. Germany spring one rocketing charts even harsh restrictions. raw material comes company U.S. owned UK company. suppliers. UK government basically throw citizens bus

Yeah, throw old people bus getting vaccine asap. Stellar logic. across variants 

I don’t think that’s true. geographic variation. vaccine worked better U.S. — 72% effective moderate severe COVID-19 – compared 57% South Africa, easier-to-spread mutated Another idiot. mind boggling stupid people are. makes sense abstract, there's argument made getting vaccines asap rather holding ideal patient. best way help risk people group end pandemic. I’m basing months doctors saying long covid stuff virus takes tight hold. Vaccines mitigate that. 
I try fall handful people say “I can’t breathe 6 months later. symptom slight cough”.  Generally long covid hard covid. right - probably gone ""the methodology study terrible really can't draw conclusions due enormous number potential confounding factors"". proper study would difficult really \*data\* terribly inadequate, would least need interrupted time series component. Oh come on... it’s news everywhere. what’s extremely stressful entirety pandemic. uncle stage 4 cancer don’t know much time left. Maybe year, maybe more, maybe less. 

The vast majority people saying “just stay home!” don’t loved ones dying who’s potential last year Earth spent alone isolation. 

I driven see handful times. wish could’ve gone more. hope see future. mom, sister, wants fly see him. know flights bad idea, without transparent messaging risky actually rather “never fly! stay home!” it’s really hard make kinds decisions. 

Some risk infection, controlled mitigated best can, better dying uncle sitting home alone two years straight Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine produced cost.

That's really opinion AstraZeneca's vaccine context. appreciate Pfizer Moderna yet production scaled yet

And production finally pick pace, doses go explained. slow right mean anything. Actually, even rn see kind inequity. include deep vein thrombosis pneumonia “not severe”, meaning allowed occur participants still count success. That’s concerning me. realize fucking bonkers expect someone go film strangers...for stranger....from reddit...lol Perhaps impossible, favourable approach process reaching herd immunity, you’d hundreds thousands die. happened. we're lol  guess, they're misunderstanding gap knowledge (i.e. understanding second shot causes massive boost immune response vs understanding causes boost). think that's realistic plan, though. comes individual choices, significant portion population never going get vaccine. 95% effective vaccines great news means individual go back normal life guilt-free matter anyone else decides do. 66% effective vaccine really give that. We'd need almost everyone take it, think that's going happen. Disagree.

Great, I'm rejoicing, amazing vaccine news. likely offered J&amp;J choices. Here's one [review subject preexisting population immunity vectors immunity developed vector vaccine administration. sent 4m UK since UK authorised vaccine 30th December. fill 75m EU gap? shit. Tbh don’t buy think average person probably doesn’t even know multiple vaccines exist one ever said was. He's simply saying wants stay quarantined assurances kids protected long term issues covid. issue?  could Belgium's numbers. That's thing guessing, we'll never know sure. Get another approved one possible take shot now! love “The Americans moment haven’t taken we’re waiting decision EMA [European Medicines EMA due make announcement Friday afternoon. 

This article outdated. EMA approved age groups. That's cool adds absolutely nothing lol True. Honestly sure could get vaccine otherwise. “Critical Public Health Infrastructure Worker.” Whatever means. puts phase 2. EU pushing embarrassed trying force AZ's hands public opinion. interpretation contract right. Many redditors clarified said

Edit: first point opinion subjective wouldn’t it?  Yeah, I'd rather trial Sinovac supervision medical agency trust. I'd rather trial carried similar population myself. Rather countries exactly known freedoms. bad thing? 5.1 says AZ try deliever within EU (best reasonable effort that) exclude delievery elsewhere. actually 6% numbers 65+ (basically enough data). exporting?

just politician country felt like “let’s nothing turn fine” good strategy, doesn’t mean “exported” Sweden. means shitlord politician felt like nothing.

In meantime swedish politicians busy covid related stuff letting infectious disease experts handle advice around infectious diseases. gotten, among obvious things, advice best thing stay home experiencing symptoms all. manageable Sweden it’s well established sick leave pay system strong union presence. system *import* implement, requires system place.

we also havent getting the
advice, like countries, schools even
for youngest children closed months end, thank god. Ask ""stay home orders"" effect looked presented ""additional effect"". think credible intervals ""additional effect"" interventions would look like? Hi question.

From understanding, Pfizer jab uses mRNA, whereas Oxford one uses traditional approach inoculation via ""disabled"" virus.

I know can't mix one dose one another dose other, but...

How effective would place give someone full course (two doses) Pfizer Vax, followed doses ox/AZ one? current rates...arriving 2025. Bro know shitall us. contact tracing team best world. 

Potential outbreaks stopped quickly LIVING NORMALLY Leaked prices Europe: AZ: 1,78 \* 2 = 3,56 Euro, J&amp;J = $8,5. 2 Times expensive, still lot cheaper Pfizer 12 \* 2 = 24 Euro example. Sweden comparable neighbours half true, half not. comparing rest Europe similarly accurate non accurate Gotta love haha excess doses donated end

But need excess doses LOL. need 5 times number people × 2. Also, donated end? Oh, thank much. I'm glad said it. see issue that? I'm surprised offended. Never expected rich countries walk walk alleged concerns well-being rest world. insulting continue pretend, that's all. husband's family ""taking pandemic seriously""... going in-person church services, choir practice, breakfast every Sunday.

I'm praying mother- father-in-law able vaccinate rest family infects them. EU isn’t supplying world like saviour, private companies supplying countries existing base within EU using ingredients over, including UK.

Imagine UK actually relied EU negotiations.

The EU also won’t restrict vaccine exports exact reason. ever divert attention fact far behind intransigence. Firstly, says production first 300m doses happen EU (5.1).

Secondly, 5.4 seems general mandate vaccine must produced EU (or UK), i.e. countries without permission. reason obviously UK EU equivalent standards regulations, EU knows anything produced UK safe, hence permission granted contract. impose requirement AZ use UK facilities.

Thirdly, reasonable break pre-existing contract. ""Reasonable best efforts"" defined term top document say breaking contracts required. Business booming! Thanks Trump! We’re still winning populations vaccinated excess donated poorer countries. trying say everyone wealthier countries vaccinated leftovers thrown away? Deniers what? Constant doom? Pfizer vaccine stomp SA variant? young people thst give shit anyone themselves. mean...Why? news keep getting pushed ""next week""? thread sub athlete getting covid (can’t remember ) &amp; got downvoted like -35 saying would recover. Considering I’m last phase country I’m waiting single person two weeks up. Luckily there's US Canada fall back on. friendly neighbours care much them!

Maybe discovered EU basically almost evil US. Maybe comes power... mean, you’re saying you’re traveling flying unvaccinated pleasure post Fauci saying even vaccinated it’s ok yet, know line is. isn’t much farther back could draw honest. 

It’s little disingenuous say since even everyone vaccinated wouldn’t 100% safe don’t see it’s ok now. return normal people decide it. Public health trying get point maximal protection. easy, that's sure. figures. Wish could clarify Gave upvote speaking truth. I’ll take downvotes now. 

This natural selection works. new mutants pushing old, need adapt defenses accordingly. 

The law jungle. 

They told us beginning coronaviruses like flu mutate quickly.. wait everyone waited two weeks thier second dose. world rotate around ignorance. evidence time. Yikes Trump still office, headline would dead wrong. Thousands years ago, people identified city state, nation. apart Melbourne's HQ cluster, multiple little outbreaks easily crushed 1/ 92% effective preventing severe Covid disease, preventing sars-cov2 infection transmission? eventual goal reduce number cases reduce everyone asymptomatic case, better change protocol cases handled. Hold beer. happens caught interacting another household? could never tell us U.S.. would violence. science aspect, public health. words, individual vs. group. They're looking protect group, would require individual sacrifice. what's upside me?

The lives friends family?

I guess much ask Americans basic sense empathy. Anecdotal office park owner 60s wife. got call provider getting vaccination next county made appointment. Drove up, waited line hours despite appointment. ID, medical card, etc.,. pulled ready go. one asked it, even name. Got shots, reminder cards, left. No? makes think that? really isn’t different setup original trial. That's point, powers mean block shipments weekly numbers short. read Pfizer made shortfull end February. Canada country getting completely fucked raw Pfizer what? people socialize even there's pandemic, simple.  Life changed.  regular people, devastating life-threatening couple different fronts, physically mentally, added tension created competing threats. 60m Novavax vaccines, look next vaccines approved UK, following news trial. Novavax vaccines produced domestically Teesside. idea people lumping UK EU UK done remarkably well vaccine procurement distribution (especially light disastrous death toll). :/ pretty sad. sure ever come this. want pandemic end, economy open going care.

And can’t agree time “running out” it’s less year already millions vaccinated even coming. sounds like another justification. Tell me, please, least one reason EU export vaccine? 

If EU would announced export controls back US UK did, would fair game. Countries companies would plan around that, like Canada choosing vaccines created EU US. 

Instead EU waited countries invested time (remember, EU squandered 3 months negotiating) money supply produce vaccines, come threaten steal them. AZ. Pfizer also behind.

At least Pfizer meet Q1 contract, probably exceed it. AstraZeneca even able deliver half contract. return normalcy, least yet.

It important limit travel spreading infection EVERYONE vaccine. save lives, return normalcy faster. also prevent many mutations possible.

It caution, masks, social distancing, travel restrictions us least fall end year. type language important people shocked can't go summer vacation, even vaccinated. somewhat annoying. Realistically, vaccines would enable people live normally, public health officials want address inequality situation, they're trying extend restrictions much possible. 

For example, would safe wear mask vaccinated, situation where, anti-mask people decide say they're already vaccinated? 

What think right thing depends perspective. Public health experts going with, treat everyone equally everyone vaccinated, instead promoting freedom individual vaccination. 

Neither 'wrong' per se, depend value system individual vs. group. ...............

So getting vaccine means jackshit? Still socially distance, wear masks, travel, fun. What's point, doc? like ignorant? bliss, say? see, Reddit (and I’m sure many dubious news sources) telling whole thing would matter weeks since last April. didn’t happen, obviously it’s fault dumb scientists public health officials keep changing goal. hate people enjoy lives want stay home forever. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

""Stay home wherever possible carry normal?"" Well sorta good stuff. Delightful read, would scroll again. thanks goggles? think society right think couple counties narrative would gain traction. Millions people getting covid (now) millions people getting vaccinated.  correct answer White Castle. don’t call sliders accident. Oh completely agree you. people going Fauci like clue he’s talking like there’s zero reasoning he’s saying. People aren’t even trying understand Fauci trying say acting outraged regardless. 

Nothing Fauci said wrong. still don’t know vaccinated people spread disease asymptotically. people mad saying this? 

Him saying getting vaccine right free pass travel correct. didn’t say you’re allowed travel. whatever want. he’s still wrong he’s saying there’s reason Fauci getting hate comment. Nice half million people dead fucking cretin. Yeah science-speak layman-speak different gap two misinterpreted. know that. JnJ announcing next week. Nope. somewhere around 30%. Technically, leave house court public opinion pretty intense moment pretty limited. Sure travel, many ""leisure activities"" non-existent. can't go movie, can't see play. incredibly difficult hang friends because, I'm sure know.. people reluctant. people office jobs go office. really can't see loved ones elderly, list goes on.

You're right law stopping people living normally, certainly lot stopping us living normally. can't see that's debilitating majority people, touch humanity. need get general public. That's get immunity fast. Start children can't infect parents, end 30-50 year old normal folks Sadly UK trial. US separate trial we’re going relying on. you’re American won’t much affect maybe May. still exciting! 😇 post makes smile. truth. I'm 100% board getting vaccine, looking counterarguments express skepticism theoretical ""long term effects"". reason assume *any* long term effects *any* vaccine? mean basic understanding vaccines work creating immune response, teaching body something new... that's it. They're rewriting DNA anything exotic. people panic equivalent someone saying ""I bought new toaster, know roof collapse?"" in... would it, two things connection whatsoever. guessed russian first, chinese second american one dead last, right, according polls... That's best new vaccines strains people first time vaccinanted.

&amp;#x200B;

Novavax that, boost, vaccine several strains.

I think Moderna Pfizer boosters. early period likely surrounded mostly unvaccinated people public spaces. Ummm, no. Aus NZ western civilization, check map history books. nice try Detected cases |
!= infections Lol I’m excited see promised 16% increase supply EU finalised agreement

Any bets whether lightning strikes twice? really think scientist gives shit you’re feeling?

And scientists advisors ones making decisions comes public policy. Whether like not, that's going component. Disregard things like that, watch clever, scientific plans messaging fail spectacularly. real life can’t force people get tested get accurate vaccine efficacy number. Israel giant clinical trial. people seek
out testing mild symptoms, won’t. people seek testing exposed, even though asymptomatic, many won’t. scientists assume vaccinated unvaccinated people seek testing similar rates simple calculation based numbers positive tests.

The clinical trials Moderna Pfizer reported 95% efficacy symptomatic Covid. didn’t make trial participants go regular PCR tests either, don’t know efficacy asymptomatic infection (though rough estimates made). 

None Israeli vaccinated people got infected severe disease. overall, Israeli results quite comparable Pfizer clinical trial. luck! Lol yeah 1. No, really didn't.

2. I'm genuinely baffled think I'm arguing here. I'm pro-infection... I'm even pro-opening-up-immediately. I'm pushing back assertion primary goal vaccine prevent death. That's all. Well, technically one though... that's happened pandemic U.S., good news? new frightful theory worthy movie version thought of. credible Brazil's virologists researchers? We’ve actually distributed around 30 million vaccines, many Australia at? stocks besides GME? Well EU take UK orders fail make timely orders. return normalcy YOU/I get vaccinated, get vaccinated. 

That's people seem grasping. Herd immunity thing gets us back normal. haha we're also going one vaccinated countries soon get seriously ill? refuse show Phase 3 results 

What basing on? learn? entire country keeps viewing communities hit hardest conmen top dumb idiots, continue leave communities behind nothing change. They’re dumb, made dumb choice they’re sick, overworked, undereducated, underpaid. It’s hard feel abandoned rest country hear kind divisive rhetoric. Dismissing entire state dumb idiots veiled classist microaggression. Words matter. 60% unvaccinated population still plenty people virus run roughshod through. Especially since prevalence virus extremely high start vaccine rollout. Wait really? would great news. source 85% ?I seen yet Canada agreement [52 million doses. Vaccine daddy JT us covered. Damn. sucks. Sorry hear. America bad, that's dropped initially mooned almost new time high. Deaths always lag they're trying help patient survive time. instant killer. rather rough :\ really. routine helps.

Wake up, exercise, take care cats, work 9-5, play online games friends work, call Facetime various family members weekend, clean house, etc. oh god yes, help I'm college right now. really rough i've felt super disconnected everything, even drink ton coffee try wake up. realize people felt same, that's bit comforting least. yes absolutely.

i'm currently trying decide whether go back college in-person two weeks hard even remember feels like. nothing feels real. daily briefs necessary hourly ones.

Sorry sorry. believe latter already done. said would pay pocket said literally legally allowed let think been. anticipation kills, doubt. Maybe one weird American maps puts USA middle divider right middle Asia? coworkers won’t wear masks. boss doesn’t take seriously. I’m afraid report OSHA, do? need completely anonymous option. coworkers put masks public walks don’t want get reported someone public. don’t wear masks around other. I’ve quiet entire year 2020 cases going they’ve gotten away far long.. Wish could something.. 65 year old father vulnerable.. Oh yeah it’s real Novavax result terrible. mRNA vaccines set expectations high knocked park. phone remind me. forget wear goggles double masks! always position work well things like N95s, KN95s, proper surgical masks, much better nothing. hear anyone saying work all. Well, least experts. We've anti-maskers along, see anyone stated help stating help. see articles saying access better masks, especially contagious strains there. Hmmm...

The EU wants share - invested lot money developing vaccine setting plants...

It’s fucked situation promotes egotistical behavior. US approve vaccines us-based trial. eastern hemisphere......

Source: Map right, feels like we're really badly Pfizer shipments EU export block. think need step away news while, pretty much refresh subreddit day hoping pandemic go away...  Fantastic. Alzheimer’s dementia already run family, 42 already deal memory issues due chronic fatigue syndrome. 

I guess start putting post notes shoes remind are. cool give us vaccine put funding schools spaced masks

this isn’t either/or dude. schools hard balling returning school even post vaccine making overtures get district concede funds improve school conditions. It’s negotiation tactic. they’re gonna open want rooms marginally better.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* bill it? much would cost pocket? contractual agreement EU ""best efforts"", failed negotiate better clause wasted 3 months ordered late.

This bullying AZ break **prior** **concrete** obligations customers stronger clauses ""best efforts"" save EU bureaucrats owning incompetence failure. 

Why ordered earlier paid more, concrete contractual obligations get orders supplied later EU ordered later, spent less money weaker EU punishing countries 

The EU screwing countries incompetent them. punishing company's cannot meet agreed upon supply. 

False, AZ agreement specified ""best effort"". Best effort include stealing shipments meant fulfil prior contractual obligations. Yeah debating it. us demanding vaccine trial nowhere near finished. options us guess coworkers access surgical stuff, people getting sent home showing cloth sudden. weird see. Plenty weddings moment. travel state able months. Maybe I'm overestimating time. cant wait things feel normal again, nowadays sucks :( Sad, yet true We've always known cloth masks great protection, better protection. addition, new Covid variants likely transmissive dealing last summer. Thus, variants widespread, cloth masks less effective. true. Nice try. Well value life slightly zero, I'm allowed kill you, right? get dictate live life. That's Germany saying couple months back.

You woods actually get around vaccinating population. Well obviously...that's point. one city many people decides vote time. Life New York City complete opposite life rest state city gets say terms governs us ultimately laws passed. 

This case lot states New York State ultimate example since population NYC astronomical. rest state always mercy NYC wants. I'll also add AZ vaccines already manufactured Australia since November exclusively Australia impacted supply problems countries all. Lol seized opportunity moving new city couple months pandemic. friends (some also moved past year too) zoom hangout distance pandemic They're better nothing. better approach would treat protective measure transition better masks broadly, kind got stuck ""use anything available"" permanent basis. never really worked well, they're nearly always better zero coverage. failing improving mask guidance earlier. It’s “beaten” X% people immunised either. 

We yet see decisive evidence extent vaccines actually inhibit transmission virus.

Vaccines are, course, vital. may “beat” virus overnight. nice see light end tunnel, regardless whether light ""deserved"". 


And reminding infection also brings immunity good way tolerate knowledge neighbors dining indoors restaurants sit home alone. US numbers worse EU though? remember early lot worse EU evened out. Hopefully Vancouver Connecticut nearly private public schools open least hybrid learning since school year started August September.  children going in-person since mid-September issues.  teachers deserve priority access vaccine parent I'm grateful came back classroom. 

Something like 2/3 schools US open extent. stuffed badly, they've got good choices, put export block vaccines including pfizer weekly EU quota met, bad taking everything, good choices sat hands 3 months getting cheaper deal, go large orders (and damn expense) would interesting see results Belgium investigation, contracts would interesting see much AstraZeneca this, moment looks like EU stuffed up, going looking countries coming restrictions months earlier, less deaths, going well Europe

The believe EU blowing can't get 59 million AZ mind boggling me... BS.

With 60% cut, EU still looking enough vaccines adult population June. huge orders CureVac (405 million), J&amp;J (400 million 1+dose) BioNTech (600 million). extra 160 million Moderna. AZ incompetent, even get close goal. 60% goal almost funny, that's bad is. AZ already showed multiple times incompetent, surprise. Pfizer exceeding goals Europe Q1. way, ordering later mean get back line, ordering later means might get worse deal, deal made, much rights vaccine time slot someone ordered earlier. translate tickets buy, notice buying product earlier give rights product. started typing reply pharmaceutical companies don’t care brand name recognition consumer level, forgot America one few(only?) countries allow pharma companies advertise directly consumers.

I’m sure mean second point. AZ aren’t making profit Well, think going send kids back school, teachers need too. It’s unconscionable send back without vaccine. It’s terrible slow rolling out. [Have PA, recently vaccines expanded certain disabilities - reason, includes smokers.

I work grocery store cells cigarettes. Even it’s health reasons, it’s tremendously infuriating every customer comes every day without mask buy cigarettes able get vaccinated me, needs deal potentially hundreds customers single shift.

Surely likely spread disease shitton people (meaning jobs) first group well. Scottish government going release proof that's true



[The Scottish health secretary, Jeane Freeman, confirmed Wednesday total Scottish vaccine allocation far 562,125 doses. those, 365,000 doses arrived Scottish vaccination centres health boards general practitioners, rest “either transit storage”. Questions raised many vaccines remain unavailable immediate use whether infrastructure place meet latest targets. over-80s due vaccinated first week February over-65s plus clinically extremely vulnerable beginning March, total 1.4m culturally ethnically similar Western countries speak Queen's English (after fashion).  22 million 328 million. We're long way everyone shot.

My wife still probably couple months away least mine gets scheduled, maybe longer. filled survey County heard back yet. 

We work home though exposure minimal, higher risk bad outcome getting Covid-19. saying makes complete sense relative RECKLESS - going bars, wearing masks, etc.

But challenges exist us living middle - ones always wear masks, bar year, struggling reasonableness activities like road trips socially distant outdoor masked gatherings.

Otherwise, appreciate kind words, like think said, arguing you, chatting, like might done friends family bar years ago.  truly hope 2021 better 2020. mainly phrased way prevent people abandoning restrictions individually whole group meets standard. Whether that's good approach different question. 2.7 million might entire 55+ age group Israel, something similar.

The Israeli Ministry Health data easy compare.  eu hasnt approved either lol I'm Belgium actually haha. factories produce Pfizer AstraZeneca vaccines possibly Johnson Johnson vaccine. Sadly, EU signed contract Novavax yet. FDA requires US trial full 30,000 participants different ages races. AZ never ran trial big. combined results UK Brazil clearly enough seniors Getting second dose next Wednesday. I'M CHOMPING BIT. Took day work sack potatoes first shot. must looking different reddit am, subreddits I'm subscribed expect long process, though maybe that's I'm subbed several science covid subreddits.

Edit: also, reputable source saying would week so, that's trump level bullshit. Saying measures would help bring number active cases obviously saying would completely gone. I'm tired trying idiots. like talking child ""don't touch that, hot"" (touch) ""ow"" ""told dummy"" right, reddit. legitimately see nothing wrong negative secondary tertiary government giving people money stay home months end. epidemiologist?   Got shot hour ago. happy one foot “done shit” club. Soriot longer insisted statement made 

He's trying find compromise huge trading block, would keep shoving incompetence face? rescind previous statement says everything.

The fact repeat statement AZ contracted ""best effort"" evert available opportunity make less correct.

Doesn't seem like EU anything aside ability bully. fact AZ agreed publish contract seems like they've called EU bluff. head L.A. County Public Health, Barbara Ferrera, keep job? think got placebo? classrooms teach 30+ students IMPOSSIBLE.

Is hybrid Even person beginning year, students wearing masks properly constantly removing them.

Where teach? protocol this? South Korea western country borders biggest shithole continent lmao. Neighbours dont decide culture, least entirely. I'm sure voters saw lesser two evils. opponents got embroiled one world's biggest ever corruption scandals. trial US start till dec expect results come months. already addressed provides opportunity reporters ask questions challenge statements press secretary president.

Does ""investing provides opportunity make money"" sound like ""you invest everything penny stocks"" you? Israel tested contact known carrier, regardless symptoms, figure include symptomatic asymptomatic infections.

In case, far mild cases none needed hospitalization (although early conclude since people may get worse while). Thanks missed important bit suppose working. Moderna Pfizer showed slight drop effectiveness far lab charge suddenly decide cloth masks don’t work? Yeah offense people can't tell least people mentally ill  Japan literally western country. Dad started giving vaccinations garage. I'm calling cops him.  400,000 people largely demographic that's prone dying country 330 million 9 million people die ordinary year.

I'm saying COVID deaths matter. holy shit rattle body counts context makes morally superior everyone else?  Leave sub call it, ""good news"" strains evade natural immunity vaccine. exactly, mom probably 100 folds risk average young healthy teacher. simply feasible give vaccine teachers instead basically anyone 65. doctor advised hospitals prepare 96 million coronavirus infections 500,000 potential deaths worst-case scenario potential extent outbreak, leaked documents documents, obtained Business Insider, come presentation made webinar hosted American Hospital Association (AHA). shipment reduced. 

3.5m contingent Canada approving 6 doses per vial brings total 4m. Pfizer said Health Canada approve 6 doses per vial, ship enough vials 4m doses. really months? think people got wrong expecting last week. vaccines 100% effective, react new variants unknown. still endangering people go then. We’re second month winter. dying day western countries? shocking.  UKs best interest cooperate 1918 pandemic first wave summer bad, December wave horrific, likely would never know sure mutation thought possible reasons second wave bad. yes flu mutate lot faster coronaviruses, expect another major wave long vaccine efficacy maintained variants, overwhelmingly likely do. novavax trial running south africa first place? lucked ended telling us something variant seems like random place Nice cope bro. yet. Hopefully get plasma center next Wednesday see today EC AZ lying. EC say ""best efforts"" clause indeed committed supply certain amount vaccines, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said German radio. defense pharmaceutical company contract EU states must utmost best correct, according committee chair.  so-called best effort clause applied period clear whether AstraZeneca could develop working vaccine. that, concrete quantities vaccine deliveries committed December 2020 first three quarters 2021, Von der Leyen said.  possible outsiders check interpretation contract correct; EU AstraZeneca agreed keep contract secret. EU wants get rid agreement. contract may still public today, say insiders, permission AstraZeneca required.  EU also working scheme stop export vaccines produced EU. suspected AstraZeneca solved production setbacks United Kingdom vaccines produced Netherlands Belgium, actually intended European market. EU paid AstraZeneca hundreds millions euros produce enough vaccine pending approval drug authorities. Later today, European Medicines Agency (EMA) decide whether vaccine approved use Europe.

Source: 'AstraZeneca zegde EU wel vaccinhoeveelheden toe' - (Dutch) absolute nonsense.  AZ already fucked massively promising numbers never able deliver.

No matter country look at, don’t enough. Remember US doses? would another wall right there. Anti-science like banned /s Seeing as, apparently, chemical components Pfizer vaccine made UK could turn ugly quickly. Especially Germans putting AZ vaccine old people reliant Pfizer one. talking I'm Sydney. lockdown since one march/april whole world went into. Since track trace cases, isolate infected, quarantine international arrivals. We've limits throughout year gathering sizes, finished mask mandate whole pandemic (2 oe 3 weeks).

But yes, get ski Japan last year? woe me. I'm sure would smart UK would obviously we'd ship vaccines EU even longer need factory.

If start thinking cutting supply Pfizer Belgium need take account UK also produces exports ingredient needed production. need get together resolve like adults rather start tit tat export bans. good news. success story. Nah. 
Im talking fair distribution vaccines, top need vaccine vulnerable ASAP. starting seem likely AZ signed two conflicting contracts. Im still wondering focus UK manufacturing though. Presumably contracts conflicting, may renegotiation UK manufacturing sent EU. Two million doses week significant single country EU. share production capability unlikely improve EUs position much. Ah, gotcha. grateful Israel merciless killers world. Makes sense westerner, though. Hopefully [not ... irrelevant regard it’s reason UK factories operating intended EU ones still getting speed. It’s claim EU hard done false delays AZ compared Uk due EUs delays signing.

Also I’d imagine (as don’t work industry) best effort clause part would best effort require breaking existing contracts. UKs priority UK factories would stand regard. really matter EU said timing separate agreements AstraZeneca made UK EU irrelevant. 
He said: “Unless term agreements AstraZeneca must supply UK first, separate arrangement UK probably irrelevant arrangement \[European\] commission. first come, first AstraZeneca get act together. They're threatening UK Canada this, they're threatening AZ. AZ ones delivering, they're ones threatening Canada incompetence get facility running adhering contract. EU put citizens first company fails deliver.

The EU taking away Pfizer Moderna doses away Canada, UK rest world, they're apparently incompetent, adhere contracts made. Unlike AZ. mad AZ incompetence. Compare deaths +80 +70 +60 +50.
We didnt finish +80. EU also pre-ordered 100mil doses seems thise doses supplied UK factories.

No EU paid upgrade Belgian facility get doses Good thing EU made purchase last year then.

Three months UK already purchased UK's first 100m foot, AZ facility UK contract EU UK threatening block it.

Nobody knows certain. UK threatened block it, EU's position expects paid for. UK's position willing take others paid for.

You've switched around, wrong. EU ordered Pfizer doses shared facility (owned American company). threatening block exports it.

The UK ordered doses facility paid construct, paid exclusive rights use it. There's nothing block doses already belong UK. BBC probably make drama, show General Election, Boris blame this! :D What, don’t believe OP’s crystal ball? /s government decided act unilaterally scientific consensus, undemocratic actions. arguments used climate change deniers. government listen experts evidence, government cannot follow rules, needs accountability. say, ""Because democracy science"", that's argument all. Kom igen. Ha lite perspektiv. question vaccine works.. but..

how contagious people actively fighting virus going day got vaccine feel invulnerable.

getting vaccine doesnt keep getting virus, keeps getting sick. comments even means. got vaccine care ? got Israel paid 3 time price getting vaccine.
Palestinians 2 governments one west bank one gaza , government tried get vaccine self instead buying guns kill Israelis. 
Further Israel eventually help care citizens. want country would do. 

I dont see usa going giving vaccines iraq Afghanistan. UK ban EU ban new fairness?

Good try, bro, no. UK bans export, EU right ban export too. world move sync, still possible regions surge, hopeful none surge places fall, overall trend would still downward.  love courtroom drama. televised? post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Whatever difference mortality even year two. Nobody lives forever. Workers generally 65. relation total number people dying, number workers (and number years life lost) tiny. highly limited supply vaccine, workers' lives matter - are, young are, therefore, much less effective vaccine used them.

The main reason protecting essential workers healthcare protect elderly come contact - reward protect directly. certainly increased risk compared contemporaries, multiple low number - elderly patients' baseline risk high number. still wear mask, least live usage gone practically nobody August maybe 1 5 now. anecdotal observation, though, take large pinch salt.

Frankly pure gold success story India. agree, understand AstraZeneca CEO thought would good idea talk confidential parts agreement newspapers Europe. broke confidentiality clause. shows incompetence AZ's part again.

You've got wrong. EU demanded contract released. spoke ""best effort"" clause, lost minds, said breached confidentiality, actions breached contract.

They like revelation suggests best effort clause may indeed exist. we'll see. course UK plants produce vaccines EU. placed order AstraZeneca 3 months EU wait queue. order fulfilled we'll shipping vaccines around world.

It's EU was, ""ok, fine, let's publish it"". AZ agreed that.

I never said false, simply stated celebrities politicians publicly getting vaccine. something fact stated became fact afterward (hence fact) dont get pat back right originally. got vaccine publicy discussion plenty others MAY also get publicly future widespread campaign hasnt happened yet

I never claimed prominent black celebrities gotten vaccine. asked many black celebrities gotten vaccine said know matter.

I later provided list known black celebrities gotten vaccine response prominent enough. received 0,1% that. Yes daily thread home base deniers. breath test, SpiroNose, soon used test locations GGDs. Amsterdam, traditional cotton swab already replaced breath test. municipality Amsterdam writes website. breathalyzer, residents know within minutes whether currently infected corona virus.

 test takes seconds, test capacity increased even further. Research by, among others, Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC) shown pressure test streets may drop sharply test used. I’m betting next round month 2....or more. Yikes. Thanks sharing. I'm pretty sure mRNA vaccines available USA general population, albeit later date. point I'm pretty sure ask choose. Sucks outside USA though, probably get mRNA vaccine. couldn’t - many places covid overwhelmed hospital systems simply spots left. necessarily. U.K. given science producing Oxford AZ vaccine India example. problem vaccine manufacturers aren’t sharing recipes due profit.

Yeah people drive friendly carefully freeway responsible someone crashing 200 mph. There's guy thread said even enter breakroom work fear covid. Germophobia abounds.  threaten stop deliveries EU? part general population, I’m sure 66% efficacy make want get even getting vaccine. terrible it’s running rampant area, number anti-vaxxers, personally want highest efficacy possible. That’s personally. don’t trust others right thing get vaccinated live. welcome! Talk louder. Even weaker vax body learn fight virus end two weeks, unvaccinated people danger. virus unknown body, may fight properly all, end viral pneumonia great many people die covid.

-this create vaccination option severe allergies affected vaccines
-if study group broad enough prevent restrictions we’ve seen vaccines (like pregnant women, etc.) controversy, would take given passed proper channels, protocols every country said: ""Look there! it!"" might well elect world leader.  right Eu fucking becuase low price, due UK/Oxford stipulations AZ vaccines actually sold cost. 

So huge delay achieve... Nothing.  Even that's case (which doubt, would open door kinds fraud?) nothing case, UK law matter here? people hit giant bills thousands network covid testing, it’s news on.

Oh, neat. always thought Moderna Pfizer stored special ultra cold freezers whatever. barely priority distribution effectively US. people want us distribution profession global scale? minds. that’s case, open everything let virus run course cause don’t see people sitting around 10+ years waiting vaccine come less xenophobia politics

Banning countries higher risk cases, higher numbers, significant threats xenophobia. Kerala MH. US UK exporting vaccines lol. Yea unfortunate response AZ threatening stop deliveries EU. I'm mistaken. prevention severe cases placebo. actually preventing 85% severe cases would severe disease vaccine. part vaccines manufactured EU shipped UK. go dates usually pay snacks! go tuesdays it’s $5!! :) flu vaccine is, average, 40% effective. 66% one shot fantastic.

My guess shot goes arms lower risk people like myself, save moderna/pfizer older higher risk populations. definitely antivaxx. said would definitely wait effective vaccine. fully believe vaccines important part society continuing exist. people unable quarantine 66% better nothing. perfect world everyone would access better vaccine sadly case. Unfortunately much hate it, poorer communities going ones get less effective vaccine simply often times dont luxury wait available them.   Good. Use good German Biontech. Vaccine elderly AZ crap younger people. abnormal blood oxygen saturation 93%? Except Moderna Pfizer cannot produced large enough amounts. 

Also J&amp;J AZ vaccins require cold storage. makes vaccins much usable large scale vaccinations owns WaPo?

Bezos.

A vested interest keeping lockdown going. instance, get less effective J&amp;J vaccine next month available then, say fall, also get moderna availability increases time? placed orders enough vaccine doses vaccinate whole populations several times over. giving shit lol. Covax program goal vaccinating 2-3 % global population. know talking about. countries Pfizer Moderna vaccines. Simple that. majority world relying China Russia. FACT! know everyone reddit bullish every vaccine seems widely irresponsible even assess vaccine, instil confidence.  Yup. normally insanely covid cautious, go Costco healthy 30 year old sister said ""people need realize ok get cold"" read comment earlier first one signed take precedence 2nd one becomes null void UK contract law. decision makers, politicians health authorities, important thing death rate hospital capacity. vaccine decreases significantly good enough them. points,

1. think know mutations work.
2. Nobody cares.

Most people vaccinated Autumn everything opened then. definitely exposed get long-term damage vaccines providing enough protection, well then, great.

Let's hope get mRNA vaccines later stop production distribution. hope so. love Serbia. Fantastic country people. travelling becomes possible again, one first places visit. Yup, Monday. public used hearing efficacy expressed terms symptomatic illness, though? apples apples look 66% (or 72% US) J&amp;J ~95% hear others, missing something makes apples oranges? Genuine question. EU justice commissioner accuses UK starting trade war

They trying distract people failures b dragging UK it, far I'm aware statements British minister matter. sure EU getting lot Moderna doses. Pfizer supplier don’t count complete joke AZ deliveries. Well info November first jab basically zero sum (it discussion visited online info might wrong, thats pharma guy back said)

Either way, different countries different costs, South Africa instance pays more. AZ says shell money upfront. going discussion whether AZ adheres rules not, saying short money boost another region increase quarter revenues even zero sum game end earnings. Inflated numbers always look good stock price.  offered healthcare professionals, go way acquire fraudulently wish everyone else realistic/optimistic people daily discussion thread. Meanwhile I’m seeing summer even fall events getting cancelled. even mention idea going back school year gets called idiot. Luckily protocol -- volunteering would much different proposition! fact lot people realize volunteering trial put greater risk side effect shot. ask anyone change anything behavior -- keep protecting like normal. good mom concerned. all, trials past (challenge trial deliberately infect people pathogen), even challenge trials UK Covid, according this: get tiff one another, I'm denying opinion. I'm adding source thought process.

Variants definitely concern reckon coming months. i'm aware believe US ordered production US based plants next several months.

So may explicit bad, spare supplies exported. fucking hilarious people actually thought Trump plan. Maybe airborne ebola r0 25, yes. no. Congrats, described capitalism already happy ""no die"" part, honestly. ""no hospital"" cherry top. scientific trial results showing 1 dose efficacy Modena Pfizer EU made conflict UK threatening stop deliveries ordered vaccines demanding UK supplies AZ. Yeah, Pfizer still reports efficacy first dose 82%. guess see JnJ says landmarked 7 14 days fact efficacy well. know controversial. God, fucking love America. media want lose cash cow. Testing doesn’t cost thousands.

If order comes in, stop unnecessary travel - like idiotic tourists insisted coming NYC holidays. 

If essential travel happens, possible get enough testing going manage it. get it. comment standpoint vaccine slightly expectation. already baked - still great us. They've using UK months.

Not even 2 want bother anyone's weekend plans.

How know working weekend, application delayed otherwise? CNN's analysis vaccine timelines one worst I've ever read. misleading average person encouraged weird thinking would take Summer *2022* get people vaccinated. must cleaned up, frustrating day. 57% barely pass approval threshold love people sincerely defend 1st scenario. People need stop using words like ""never/forever"" willy nilly. one goals vaccine get people go back participate economy, they're going need able to

No vacations, travel, restaurant, museums, etc know kids safe.

Wait minute, going transmission, vaccinated grandma? one we're protecting? LMFAO, okay yeah cause we're already infected 😂😂😂 It’s bit Eerie 🤭 worried myself. don’t want responsible spreading vulnerable people. willing take minor risk greater public good. means abunch people carelss get point   Instead, United States needs focused framework, guided science common sense, open schools safely soon possible, considering risk students parents closed classrooms, keeping teacher fears front mind. plan would look something like this.

Reopen lower schools. Start day cares elementary schools, given reduced transmission risk.

Enforce COVID-19 protocols within schools throughout community. means mandatory mask wearing public social distancing. also means public officials encourage “library rules” public space—keeping quiet, talking whispers.

Accelerate vaccination procurement distribution. U.S. could well 100,000 daily COVID-19 cases middle February, current rate decline. faster vaccinate, faster get back normal.

Distribute high-quality scientific information. important, educate teachers lower transmission risk young students—and ongoing necessity COVID-19 protocols—to get enthusiastic buy-in, naturally contingent success reducing community spread accelerating vaccination.

I don’t blame teachers keeping schools closed—yet. blame government media. Public communication disease horrendous, Trump White House fount nonsense. Meanwhile, journalists professionals, attempt fight back Trump’s disinformation, leaned heavily COVID pessimism clung outdated fears secondary spread among young kids. That’s made lot people unnecessarily concerned kids silent vectors disease, made teachers feel like thrown wolves country failed every pandemic test. teacher relying information mainstream press—especially teacher pandemic pod included immunocompromised relatives—I might pretty scared going back school.

Under banner safety, many people passed along alarmist information contributed lot misery. Americans learn, accept, preponderance evidence simply doesn’t support fears govern school policy today.


Edited formatting. get everything lined teh article, got close possible (couldn't copy links) It’s got densely populated cities US clustered along I95 Interstate, that’s honestly surprising. Philadelphia, NYC, Jersey cities interlinked within fairly small geographical circuit, bound spread other. California, Texas, etc. may populated, they’re also spread out.  want see follow-on data Pfizer; one Phase III trials SA, assume still following folks. Federal health officials CDC week called children return American classrooms soon possible. essay Journal American Medical Association, wrote “preponderance available evidence” fall semester reassured agency adequate masking, distancing, ventilation, benefits opening schools outweigh risks keeping kids home months.

The CDC’s judgment comes particularly fraught moment debate kids, schools, COVID-19. Parents exhausted. Student suicides surging. Teachers’ unions facing national opprobrium reluctance return in-person instruction. schools already making noise staying closed 2022.

Into maelstrom, CDC seems shouting: Enough! which, would add: took long?

Research around world has, since beginning pandemic, indicated people 18, especially younger kids, less susceptible infection, less likely experience severe symptoms, far less likely hospitalized die. million-dollar question school openings always transmission. reasonable fear schools might open let bunch bright-eyed, asymptomatic, virus-shedding kids roam hallways unleash pathogenic terror would infect teachers families.

“Back August September, lot data” make recommendation schools, Margaret Honein, member CDC’s COVID-19 team, told New York Times. Okay, September 100 days, 15 weeks, several dozen remote-learning school days ago! Meanwhile, anybody paying attention long figured children probably less likely transmit disease teachers peers. longer statistical secret lurking appendix one esoteric paper. repeatedly replicated conclusion waterfall research, around world, past six months.

In May 2020, small Irish study young students education workers COVID-19 interviewed 1,000 contacts found “no case onward transmission” children adults. June 2020, Singapore study three COVID-19 clusters found “children primary drivers” outbreaks “the risk SARS-CoV-2 transmission among children schools, especially preschools, likely low.”

By September, many U.S. scientists going record say transmission schools seemed considerably rarer surrounding communities. “Everyone fear would explosive outbreaks transmission schools,” Michael Osterholm, director Center Infectious Disease Research Policy University Minnesota, told Washington Post. “We say that, date, seen younger kids, really important observation.” Throughout fall, evidence accumulated. “Schools not, fact, appear major spreaders COVID-19,” Emily Oster, economist Brown University, wrote last October Atlantic, summarizing conclusions national dashboard school cases.

In January 2021 paper, team Norwegian researchers traced 200 primary-school children ages 5 13 COVID-19. found cases secondary spread. findings “demonstrate limited role children transmission SARS-CoV-2 school settings,” wrote. Another study researchers Duke University 35 North Carolina school districts in-person teaching found cases child-to-adult spread schools. concluded typical mitigation policies, masking physical distancing, sufficient prevent school outbreaks. “Our data indicate schools reopen safely,” concluded, long policies remain place.

If intermittently following news COVID-19 transmission children remember scariest reports, likely two questions. scary South Korean study? horrible summer-school outbreak Israel?

Let’s start South Korea. July, large Korean survey found children ages 10 19 spread coronavirus efficiently as, even aggressively than, older adults. (It found kids 10 transmit virus much.) frightening conclusion widely interpreted rule possibility in-person school children fifth grade above. August, Korean research team caveated conclusions, saying couldn’t prove whether children study infecting parents, whether parents infecting kids, whether entire households exposed third party.

More infamous reported outbreak Jerusalem high school summer, made headlines around world. New York Times’ summary representative: “When Covid Subsided, Israel Reopened Schools. Didn’t Go Well.” Here’s Times described outbreak:

The Israeli government invited entire student body back late May. Within days, infections reported Jerusalem high school, quickly mushroomed largest outbreak single school Israel, possibly world. virus rippled students’ homes schools neighborhoods, ultimately infecting hundreds students, teachers relatives.

The Israeli lesson seemed simple: open schools, cases explode, outbreak reverberate throughout country, people die.

Except wasn’t simple. Last week, follow-up study Israel cluster found universally described school outbreak really nothing sort. time Israel reopened schools, eased restrictions large group gatherings. “Easing restrictions large scale gatherings major influence resurgence,” authors concluded. “No increase observed COVID-19 … following school reopening.” causal chain described New York Times backwards. real story went like this: Relax social-distancing measures community without vaccines, see cases explode, watch outbreak ripple schools.

As evidence children’s COVID-19 risk diminished past six months, evidence families struggling school closures mounted.

“If ask whether duty society look children, answer would ‘No, don’t think so,’” Matthew Snape, pediatric researcher University Oxford, told me. “There clear evidence shutting schools harms students directly, terms education mental social health.”

Although long-term scholastic social effects year remote learning generation children yet clear, know already damning enough: Remote learning gutted public schools high-income parents pull kids private schools bespoke learning pods. Calls mental-health hotlines increased. Las Vegas, home nation’s fifth-largest school district, cluster student suicides pushed local officials phase elementary schools. indirectly, school closures also result delay immunization programs, interrupt free-lunch programs, make impossible edifying effects play.

Nobody claim children cannot transmit virus, schools “safe” pandemic way that, say, talking telephone sibling lives 2,000 miles away safe.

But people 18, young children especially, less susceptible infection, less likely experience severe symptoms, less likely hospitalized die, less likely transmit disease older teenagers young adults. Scientists aren’t entirely sure why, one theory something way virus docks cells. Coronaviruses covered halo spike-shaped proteins (that’s name comes from: corona, crown). spikes thought attach another protein surface cells called ACE2. Children lower levels ACE2 nasal tissue adults do. suggests that, theory, kids would provide fewer open ports virus dock, invade, ransack rest body.

Overall, school cases reflection environment. COVID-19 running rampant town throw bunch kids adults building without safety protocols, odds pretty high you’re going exacerbate outbreak. cases fall across country adjust risk calculus. choice us “Keep schools closed COVID-19 eliminated, smallpox-style, face Earth” “Open every school immediately.” It’s cold, eh? Stay inside... Herd immunity strategy worked like charm.Congrats everyone. narrow view this. It’s still going several months (maybe year countries) actually get everyone vaccinated, still much need worry fast virus spreading. 

From public health standpoint, one cares symptoms milder second time around. It’s spread. odds could vector spreading virus went significantly changes equation deal virus everyone vaccinated. looking articles nasal sprays, may need used routinely like every 20 mins preventative. trying get political, need expand understanding ""national defense"". include tanks bombs. also needs include vital manufacturing capabilities like vaccines, drugs, energy etc. need make sure sort vital industries never outsourced always protect people without rely charity others.

PS: Nations obviously charitable can, end day look citizens first. 30% population infected 

7% Eh, pretty well documented in-person teaching far dangerous profession COVID.

&amp;#x200B;

Even districts open, think teachers behind healthcare workers, also people like airport workers, bus drivers, grocery store workers contact customers. (However, lot grocery store workers contact customers, cutting front vaccine line without lot justification.)  less disappointing sounds. Overall similar Oxford/AstraZenica vaccin.

These two produced larger quantities stored moderate temperatures, makes ideal large scale vaccinations.

The Moderna Pfizer vaccins used high risk persons, two (J&amp;J Oxford/AZ) everyone else.

There also Novavax similar Moderna Oxford/AZ vaccins Yeah seen online go 700k small towns 3 million prime locations. see they're struggling now. trying helpful

I know are, make less condescending. like telling poor person ""just make money"" - like, guess 'helpful', we've heard before.

I need human connection life feel meaningful. think that's HEALTHY THING. I'm tired feeling like I'm broken zoom calls cut months. light end tunnel; spring going nothing like last year vast majority world.

Is there, really? Half Europe going locked summer earliest. Osterholm dooming around every day telling us going get worse worse. J&amp;J 100% efficacy, people bitching enough. one thing internet people. coworkers lot friends seem convinced 2021 hosed. 

I make another year this. civil. variant 20% last week, record deaths week probably patients infected week even earlier. There's big lag. current deaths pre-b.1.1.7 probably going get worse. gets thrown around time every study I’ve seen shown vast majority long COVID cases individuals admitted hospital. Tylenol NSAID.  Vaccine nationalism, sowing: fuck yeah!!

Vaccine nationalism, reaping: fuck, sucks! 62% efficient I'm mistaken hospitlisations. even develop symptoms vaccine likely still stop going hospital. That's key bit. mind getting slightly ill definitely want go hospital. 

And considering scarce supply right EU significantly help countries EU speed vaccinations. trash headline WaPo? Seriously?? Man, hate see actual “fake news” fuel conspiracy theorists. still didn’t go hospital

Because need to, want to, reasons? seems significant. Well God side still 100% convinced I'm familiar UK EU contract laws, make sense AZ fulfill UK contract deal penalties EU, rather breaking contracts dealing 2 sets penalties? Seriously, people acting like go war EU. get that, miss getting good beard trim barber, complete warm foam straight razor. admitted ICU, intubated receive mechanical ventilation without hospitalization? seem defining way study. correct Reddit collectively young remember people poorer countries. vaccine give people 18. 


The 18 crowd need 95% vaccine 18 crowd gets 2/3 can't spread help kill covid. 


Also kids dont like shots work better them. age well. EU blocked AZ vaccine exports UK.  issue apparently breaking severe illness hospitalization separately, since they're saying prevented 85% severe infections 100% percent hospitalizations. severe infection indicate hospitalization? I'm assuming they're counting cases person simply get hospital whatever reason. won’t get vaccinated instead? 66% much better flu shot vaccines. It’s one shot, prevents going hospital 100% time. Coz there’s nothing better worry moment. Correction: trying fuck day one claiming they're better everybody else. Idk, maybe legal battle something vaccinations covid 19 distributed? doubt tho /S did. 

5.1 ""within EU"". mention UK EU

5.4 ""EU + UK"" 5.4 only

Easy stuff. even bolded important part standard just... make similar decisions far slower bureaucratic way? Avoid topic political comments. Avoid topic political comments. looks like based current vaccine candidates, still opt two doses Pfizer Moderna. Thanks know long haul covid care hospitals clinics popping world help people? lot messed people. personally know formerly healthy person sees cardiologist. It’s like never flu before. 

This virus like polio, isn’t yet well understood it’s people. 

If want write people off, that’s fine. logic, it’s easy write dead since virus isn’t nearly deadly others. absolute numbers princess diamond better New Zeeland. vaccine allow much higher potential mutation others allow much replication/mutation.

How figure exactly? 

And booster take much time all, adjustments made relatively quickly vaccine base rolled without need rerun trials (depending approval), example, Moderna sequenced vaccine candidate 48 hours following release Covid-19 genetic structure. Odds currently working South Africa booster cover event vaccine proves less effective. 

I sure obsession trying see worst every situation, highly likely mutations continue distant future, small adjustments made yearly turn inconsequential disease. missing point, know theory life temporary live though really understand that. Rather different definition. Vaccination allows country operate normal, border lockdowns travel restrictions allow cases stay near 0, hardly normal. tinder still must kept away spark Oz NZ, 80%+ immune country tinder.  Cat food really expensive, give break!  beleive limit UK fill finish, tens millions doses AZ bulk storage Right supply constraint. US enough doses mRNA vaccines citizen (including children) September (well, 90% them, everyone take it). 

So can't see someone gets J&amp;J shot April able get Moderna/Pfizer July, let's say, wants to. can't. want able live life normally without scared getting sick. Hate Russian money. vaccine site EMTs ready would effect took J&amp;J now, years line got Pfizer shot? Would protect more, could somehow interfere other? No! I'm talking COVID! deadly disease us come contact lifetimes! fuck I'm tired trying explain shit. Since vaccine came holier-than-thou ""everyone needs take precautions"" sub turned selfish ""I'm protected now, fuck hahahaha!"" sub. fuck it. care. Get vaccine case go live life. Hopefully one y'all spread I'm waiting get mine. confirmed Pfizer Israel. almost certainly Moderna too. wish people understood more. WANT TEACH, people idea they're kids dropped they're School like always. Wow, first thought. one maybe go back drawing board 2 weeks second dose 
You’re sub demanding everyone else source claims yet yet reciprocate.

How **you** provide sources show large, longterm studies longterm effects? 

Where’s proof? 

In 66% sound great reduces illness ""regular"" flu less makes manageable. even do? keep saying enough really anything actually do? many people don’t get flu shot - it’s well known fully effective.

We need widespread vaccine adoption. focusing products work well, ones people want.  dug yet, comparison peak antibody titers J&amp;J, versus peak (one two shot) Moderna Pfizer? case works one shot (yay), wait almost two months max protection (boo)? efficacy numbers post-peak period?  argue order pay takeaway delivered want it. dont care others ordered day - resturant accepts order need deliver. stand now. 
It absolutely doesnt matter contract made - matters contract regarding deliveries etc. alarmist article. 1. 7 day average new cases still falling 2. Thursdays Fridays typically highest days week.

We nearly year people still panicking single datum point? many negatives completely agree real thing people struggling. saying cannot *personally* understand it. Like in. understand it’s happening, I’m sympathetic it, kinda blows mind...

I acknowledge I’m touch lot people this. Data shows depression like tripled. Maybe more? Obviously people struggling...I don’t understand personally, people can’t like, heh watch TV stuff year...it’s bad least I’m alive. interesting. Florida done better right to, pretty much entire pandemic. Unfortunately don’t know why, probably won’t studies done years later. read it. It’s written pretty simple language rather complex legal jargon. Better look important bits rather hearing second-hand interpretations. people skeptical vaccines already, overwhelming evidence they're safe swayed them, would different? MMR vaccine safe. is. gIvEs KiDs AuTiSm. No, doesn't, study disproven doctor's medical license taken away. aUtIsM. 

No amount evidence amount good one two pieces effective propaganda. is. good idea.

Edit MMR MMRA don’t think Brits going back forth Dubai, overall stats UAE aren’t even patch UK’s figures. like someone flying US London. horrible figures mostly recently. heard man, neck Severe meant severe definition. still toi low oxygene slight organ damage, still higher risk dementia etc. Flashes 2019 ranking countries best prepared pandemic. \~14 days second dose I’m actually happy guys relieved you’re getting vaccines. surprised quantity Totally understand. Yes but... (No data available covid yet)

It differs according disease example flu vs. shingles. Also individual immune system plays major part (and probably many factors fully understand yet). ""young"" case might 65-70.  suggesting? Permanent masks permanent banning anything made people happy? joyless world. Tell country signed contract vaccines produced US  yet, part think we're getting holiday gathering spikes (and we've seen spikes, coincide people taking virus seriously increasing preventative measures) Friendship AstraZeneca ended, Novavax new best friend Irrelevant said, 'old' Zealand province Zeeland Netherlands, curious. It’s bigger purpose. chose safe considerate, not. Shitty 2 years constant gamble death/biological damage/re-enforced shitty Covid attitude “hanging out” good trade, imo. That’s started actually getting nutritional supplementation right March.

Let kids back schools Hate debbie-downer think misinterpreted statistics. 48M doses distributed, 26M shots gone arms. site pharmacist said stay 15 minutes. someone asked 15 minutes said “I’m watching clock, say it’s 15 minutes it’s 15 minutes” Hmmm, link? Dodged it? Israël big outbreak still infection rates comparable USA. okay here's reasons that's bad unfair

To date scientifically confirmed case person infected someone room time them. two three possible cases. chances overwhelmingly good fine. Best luck dad. I’m US, argument applicable country ""regular standards testing""? clinical trials COVID-19 vaccine candidates enrolled many people trials popular vaccines HPV, Shingles, Chickenpox, MMR...

It's given 22 million people US. Nobody died. Fewer 100 allergic reaction it. thought america ran vaccines read something wrong last week? I’d pay good money travel singapore get vaccine. Ok, please point recently published scientific study shows large quantities mild cases resulting permanent lung damage disabilities. Anecdotal stories don’t count. Consciousness crisis fault average people #stayingthefuckhome, government incompetence borders conspiratorial collusion authoritarianism, rising. *most* popular sentiment, hard line lot people EU countries can't get shit together late spring/summer, done complying. Yeah, sucks elderly immunocompromised, can't keep living like false promises ever-restricting measures clear outline stop them. yeah, governments giving *themselves* sver-extending 'COVID emergency powers' whatever please... hope people learn shit.  also US export ban production. fucking ridiculous watch wasteful they're Hospitalization death metrics matter vaccines 100% eliminate problems. Normalcy must return. keep people hospitals definitely dying. matters. Great news sure. know 30 ages weights. conditions. got vaccine two weeks date living life like normal. UK contract AZ UK. AZ problem sign incompatible contracts main goal prevent severe disease hospitalizations. 

J&amp;J's vaccine prevented 85% severe disease 28 days 100% 49 days. 

It also prevented 100% hospitalizations 28 days. 

This allow us return normal. 

So yes good terms pure efficacy also advantages. single dose, easier cold storage requirements another manufacturing facility supply millions doses. teachers ahead jobs much higher risk exposure? heavily unionised militant, shouldn’t mean get jump queue. Let data guide decision making process. U.K. they’re vaccinating half dose, full dose. read full dose two-dose course administered consisting 0.5ml followed second dose 0.5ml administered 4 12 weeks first dose, accordance official guidance time. interval longer recommended interval left doses, second dose still given (using vaccine given first dose possible, see Additional Information). course need restarted.

Where read HD/SD?

As 90% upper confidence interval... SD/SD 41·0% 75·7%, 64% expected value. means might well receive information soon vaccine 41%, vaccine 75% effective.

50% minimum needed vaccine certification. would rejected. time vaccine approved available significant quantities we'll already already vaccinated vulnerable populations. part comment negative? said ""great wide use""  SA variant doesn’t resist vaccines, though... may slightly less effective still work well. nonsense? COVID-19 killed 400,000 Americans. America gotten crushed. Yes, media made sure that. people starting actually *understand* panic subsiding. hence increasing unwillingness comply nonsensical, ever-changing restrictions worked first place.  Meanwhile I’m going back school tommorrow, 2 face face classes. 

However, wear masks sit chairs 6 feet apart, colleges want students back there’s chance students getting infected? Pfizer Moderna like insanely high efficacy vaccines history don’t even measure to. JNJ even higher efficacy many vaccines got primed insane expectations Pfizer Moderna, 66% doesn’t register still amazingly good efficacy actually is. Flu shots 40-60% effective accept severe illness death comes flu given level vaccine efficacy therefore 3 vaccines covid must mean restrictions lift get back life. matter someone without symptoms transmits someone else, also doesn’t develop symptoms? That’s necessarily means though. Plenty people long-haulers chronic, sometimes permanent, disabilities *mild* symptoms. don’t hospitalized still really really bad. ""What's honey..? paid house? Burn sucker say! Make bonfire party it!"" literally everything interpreted favour EU. Got you. They're talking 100s million doses, world need several billion. getting about? thinking country likely get booster afterwards like flu shot really huge. Remember, AstraZeneca's vaccine 62% efficient preventing infection TWO doses. J&amp;J 72% efficient one dose requires cold storage specifications AstraZeneca's.

Now, prevents severe symptoms 85% cases, whereas vaccines 100% people vaccinated, something keep know ultra orthodox getting vaccinated, Arabs? choosing vax? one shot need stored extraordinarily cold temperatures. Also 85% effective severe disease prevented hospitalizations.  Pfizer Moderna vaccines vastly exceeded expectations. 66% fine far vaccines go (the flu vaccine little 40% effective) still drastically slows spread. 66% people throwing around kind average different levels efficacy. quote [the J&amp;J press vaccine candidate 85 percent effective preventing severe disease across regions studied, [i] 28 days vaccination adults 18 years older. Efficacy severe disease increased time cases vaccinated participants reported day Janssen COVID-19 vaccine candidate demonstrated complete protection COVID-related hospitalization death, 28 days post-vaccination. clear effect vaccine COVID-19 cases requiring medical intervention (hospitalization, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)), reported cases among participants received Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, 28 days post-vaccination.

My take efficacy 1) better serious illness, 2) gets better time passes shot.

""[C]omplete protection COVID-related hospitalization death, 28 days post-vaccination"" pretty good news.  One mask ok. We're talking 2 masks here. see article? kids virtual. I've saying this. Everyone acting like anything 90% efficiency useless inefficient. logic may well forget annual flu shots since they're 40-60% efficient. End day aslong vaccine keeps hospital stops dying I'll take whatever vaccine get. I'm going become fussy pick choose people reddit act take pfizer/moderna. 

Also important remember vaccines robust data new strains around got results pfizer/moderna. Please spread bullshit elsewhere. still testing efficacy ad26 covid vaccine new mutations, unknown vaccines future-proof are. J&amp;J vaccine 'lesser vaccine'. discredited bullshit flu huh? Big Trump fan?
Fuck kids popular sentiment here.  inflammation, low oxygen levels, brain damage associated severe cases. mild/asymptomatic case extremely unlikely going symptoms vaccinated. intents purposes risky catching cold flu point. We're given vaccines many places we've already gone back, everywhere state.

I'm young healthy, I'll probably okay level precautions take classroom KF94s face shields, worry people like 61 year old mother people underlying conditions person whole time may still waiting April May point they've person since August. I’m sure works mass vaccination sites, know pharmacy, required watch every patient 15 minutes post vaccination. Could reason can’t turn people protection increase time? new immune response vaccination opposite would mire likely  I’m gonna say this. vaccines 100% effective preventing hospitalization/death, issue? cares there’s still chance virus enter body give couple days sick? Wasn’t whole reason destroyed everyone’s livelihood make sure hospitals won’t overrun? Well won’t be. Enough enough. 

The goalposts cannot allowed shift eradication. hospitals fine people getting normally sick, there’s nothing wait anymore. don’t ruin everyone’s lives flu, Covid reduced vaccines. Reading comments sub give weird dystopian vibe people never want sick eradication/zero sickness acceptable outcome. I’d rather die live life forever. I’ve dealt German regulators (financial, medical)

I expect German medical regulator spreadsheet says threshold data volume met. say yes. 

Their decision, understandable one like Kaplan-Meier estimators. personally think cost-benefit analysis vaccine safety concerns roll en masse definitely see coming from. thats bullshit, EU already made clear restrict commence #Does anybody else feel going non-essential fun activities (restaurants, bars, movies, theme parks, arcades, vacations, anything else nature) worth money-wise right now?

Even aren’t suffering job loss pay cuts right making exactly 2019, still don’t think it’s worth going fun right now. 

Because activities mentioned expensive. $20 meal cook home $3, $120 amusement park ticket, $4 per game arcades, $12 movie ticket, $159 night stay hotel hundreds dollars food transportation, going fun way expensive, even normal times.

But **why would pay PRICE REDUCED EXPERIENCE?** paying $12 movie ticket, $120 theme park ticket, $100 arcade, thousands dollars vacation, able enjoy fully, without mask face, without worrying physical distancing catching COVID, etc. Even vaccine, 40%-50% population gets it, still going wear mask practice physical distancing. 

You better spending entertainment travel budget elsewhere getting full money’s worth. ideas:
- Invest money something productive, like emergency fund retirement fund.
- Donate money charity help people need more.
- Save entertainment travel money mask distancing requirements end, get full value money.
- insist spending now, try home activities enjoy it’s full value.
- - extra streaming service two.
- - new video game new book.
- - new hobby item, wether it’s arts crafts set, cooking equipment, online coding class subscription. EU even buy Novavax Valneva far (only explorative talks) GSK vaccine? Even EU fully vaccinated GSK vaccine released. Even teachers vaccinated, could even consider opening schools 30+ unvaccinated kids room together? I'm doctor, seems obvious, not? get flight people two countries carrying variant each, there's nothing stopping entering system infecting you. J&amp;J many game changing advantages Pfizer Moderna ones. single dose vaccine stored 2C makes sending vaccines remote locations way easier. Pfizer moderna vaccines pretty much given city centers extreme cold require. J&amp;J use existing vaccine infrastructure, (if needed) transported literally common fridge. Anywhere world store cold milk beer place store J&amp;J vaccine.

This suggest however might best deprioritize J&amp;J vaccine city centers, though. would believe so, yes. I'm sure mainly people risk getting seriously sick flu mass-vaccinated anually. 're going inocculate 70% total population, ever blamed vaccinated flu, cause spreading virus causes others necessarily vaccinated. I've heard, German panel cautious. even strongly recommend flu shots 65+. That's I'm 100% it, letting data come first. flu shot alone put father law ICU. think us traditional immune compromised regular vaccine bothered man 20s? 30s? Risk much higher overweight Lupus sufferers like severe illness. 

I agree, that's also worst fear. know MIL survive it. got late stage COPD needs lung transplant already. flu vaccine harms FIL bad, would COVID-19 him? boyfriend scarred lungs Whooping Cough injuries. Lupus, body could become confused eat organs instead attacking virus. 

It's decision made lightly. Lmao. article would never publicized Trump. goofy. Huh? way covid long haulers people issues flu. It’s reasonable people want get infected covid particular vaccine maker came short. much better alternatives.

Here interesting Anderson Cooper piece talks doctors new Mount Sinai covid research effort, interested. [Post Acute Covid Syndrome Call skeptic, see numbers severe cases placebo arm day 49, I'm going put lot stock arbitrarily drawn line.  problem morons give lip-service masks. many times seen masks worn nose, glorified chin-warmer? Wake fuck assholes, wearing mask improperly wearing mask all. I'd like see stores et al enforce mask-wearing mandate mask face, wearing properly. Worst case scenario U.K. suspend exports lipids needed production Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine 57% copied headline said, post anything new. Eventually we'd accept level risk reasonable position take, imo understand, Pfizer Moderna vaccines tested variants laboratory setting. unfortunately don’t human trials variants. Johnson Johnson Novavax data that. Even then, Novavax trial SA small number people. phase 2b trial. Sure, may think would irrational people think would case, might irrational Dr.s scientists that-but since people rational? Clinicaltrials.gov registry clinical trials see primary secondary outcome definitions. one J&amp;J: 
 
The definitions symptoms per FDA guidance documents &amp; consistent among trial sites investigators. order this, standardized diagnostic criteria level severity defined advance sites (this info available site, available upon publication scientific journals &amp; FDA regulatory review). information available trial registry, e.g. breaths per minute defining criteria shortness breath. Likely oxygen saturation there, requirement intubation supplemental oxygen, etc.
 
""Moderate defined one sign symptom list signs symptoms, respiratory rate greater equal 20 breaths per minute symptoms shortness breath two signs symptoms list sign symptoms severe COVID-19 defined FDA guidance."" 
 
 ""Burden Disease (BOD) Based First Occurrence Molecularly Confirmed Symptomatic COVID-19. BOD evaluated based first occurrence molecularly confirmed COVID-19, including mild, moderate severe/critical COVID-19 case."" Well successful exporting fuckup strategy half EU (including country) Haha read it, bits fancy.  Racist cops need fired spot, allowed work security capacity more. totally honest, fact Israeli Arabs choosing vaccinate going much bigger deal regards anti-semitism/anti-Israel anything said. Israeli Arabs start dying Covid large numbers Jewish Israelis vaccinated Arabs aren't, going look very, bad. :( Frankly deserve comments like mine shit “essential” means society. 

It’s become cop word office max Bobby print shit you. Hallelujer don’t think that’ll true new strains (aka South African Brazilian) running amuck... Yes unfortunately. know many though, course always reported. Yesterday read doctor took Dec three days later started bleeding skin. died three weeks later (I think two weeks ago). read news vaccine 
now suggested 65.

I think vaccine needs refined tested. feel like we're guinea pigs ... going end well. limited knowledge here: understand 2 factories Europe 1 inside UK build vaccine, see UK government sequestrating flow created leave island. Vaccine nationalism begins. Thank you. came looking answer ""how many"" title. got ""many"" let's talk 3. fair, EU hot either lately, cases deaths per capita. vaccine rollout legitimately lot slower, part due several extra weeks approving vaccine, also really slowly giving (especially France, last heard).  Questionable headline random website? EU threatening stop Pfizer vaccine going UK? Everytime go San Diego County's site appointment go screening questions site find appointments. big waste time. app backwards. first show open appointments, steps make appointment.

Does anyone know schedule time day appointments first posted? lot shockingly racist (I’m kidding course, it’s racist Republican American that). also good point. It’s really unfortunate kids aged headed different directions next year. Correct I’m wrong (by correcting don’t mean downvoting). It’s pretty nice decrease severe cases. still get sick (while vaccinated j&amp;j), means transmit people right? it’s true, doesn’t look like good news me. 1) don’t want virus spread. increases mutation probability. 2) Since research found even mild symptoms, virus still hurts body, I’m sure really feel safe vaccine. 
Sounds like it’s better wait moderna pfizer vaccines. 

P.s. sub became toxic lately. Maybe answer questions (or others) without downvoting right ? see mentioned 100 million April, places say June. Anyone know right? I'm aware anywhere letting pick. get get. Non-paywall talking Cluster 5 H69/V70? feel like we're Texas makes sense, 1B Texas adults 65 anyone age 16 underlying health condition--including obesity; teachers risk would fall this, obviously all. difference sort study? I'm going articles like yesterday: bad AZ announced 60% reduction dose delivery week ago. Solely EU course ;) Also 100% effective stopping hospitalizations.

Stick arms. contract dispute AZ EU nothing UK  headline perfect. backing seeing completely wrong starting argue semantics word ""to"" means. I'm flashbacks Clinton's meaning ""is"".

Just admit look anything up, read j&amp;j release posting, jumped gun spread fake news reputable media outlet. correct post say completely right.

This exactly people end distrusting media read loud clueless posts it. God damn dude. swedes live urban environments. Compare germany, 77.4%, France 80.4% even netherlands 91.9

You could also compare Denmark (88%), Finland (85.5%), Norway (82.6%). think Sweden's urbanization rate explains difference Covid cases.  Immortality come. think FDA wants look UK data, Oxford, hold hope novavax. idea don't, like UK country zero health standards. Yes Hell preventing hospitals overrun!!!!!! easy unfortunately it’s feasible everyone. good point. think scenarios talked about, think seniors graduated high school couldn’t take senior trip pandemic. Unfortunately I’m sure later time they’re going different directions (college, moving abroad, etc). really sucks them. empathy. *handshake Chances they've heard already multiple times, sound condescending AF. 

I appreciate that... posting thread people asking questions sharing advice, kinda natural share whatever coping strategies worked them.

The situation sucks everyone, trying helpful share they're managing themselves.

There's light end tunnel; spring going nothing like last year vast majority world. can. So, safe ASSUME many confirmed cases COVID-19 detected long participants vaccinated. point immune response stronger 49 days compared 28 (chose time points severe symptom report), continue getting stronger time passes. We're talking initial curve titer antibodies reaches peak plateaus period time. That's referring to. I'm saying participants time develop strong enough immune response (some didn't, did). reasonable point- AZ US trial look to, whilst obviously SA, Brazil strains specifically much spread, community prevalence reported theory, slightly equal comparison wrt timeframes I'd like see data compares normal lungs someone contracted covid J J vaccine. damage? Short term? Long term? Strokes? Organ damage? wait four weeks? Necause sure body builds immune response point vaccination immune response slowly fade away get stronger. assume four weeks good approximation time initial immune response builds Yes considering seasonal influenza vaccine designed protect three four influenza viruses research indicates likely spread cause illness among people upcoming flu season, several (known) variants going around current version seems work well variants (and seriousness Covid), people probably feel safe even current version vaccines. going problem. difference competence makes.  worst first something.  So, control group, whatever. think science made people know terms vaguely know definitions terms might be. I’m construction. I’ve listened guys who’ll burn thru 2 packs smokes day (the shit kind doesn’t label) argue don’t trust shit put vaccine might kill ya See get friend someone else report behalf? mean Rudy modern get mean don’t know long Covid common post viral syndrome.  strokes.... heart attack. Exclusively brought Infowars think find way round I've using carageenan nasal mouth spray years. that's nothing new. live Sweden product use called Viruseptin.   little related comment, feel bad kids couldn’t attend summer camp last year thus aged out. refusing refund families too. Sucks around. use ok cupid. here!
I told friend using republican talking points justify still going bars events. left group chat soon everyone stopped messaging there.
I saw recently flew California disbelief selfishness.
I miss friendship, can't imagine would ever same. I'll always remember behavior this. Nobody said that. I’m pretty sure that’s works. I've given sub. Everyone like anti maskers. want life back normal bad want hear know anything fit narrative. People polarized now. Oooooo [protein super established vaccine tech. fact it’s effective crazy awesome. anyone family friends fence vaccinated mRNA it’s “new tech” could convinced take this. Pfizer Moderna effective variants. know guess I’ll come new excuse brain damage. Pfizer Moderna single booster can’t put much mRNA get severe reactions vaccine since self-adjunctex Let guess, executive producer Bonald Crump. 1.7 Mil. doses today? That’s amazing. Fauci lost lot respect eyes reporter months ago asked question responded “If answer, markets explode” could see expression almost sense megalomania. respect medical experience, ego definitely pretty bad. father immunologist says Fauci reputation like medical community several decades heart hearts irrelevant. need see science says. chance could infect someone vaccinated. strong evidence suggest can't. Science still working question.

Better err side caution.

That said, studies I've seen, looking likely vaccinated can't infect someone else. question still open though. disagree entirely list. Wealthy, developed, first world countries wealth resources educated citizens ones comparatively handled pandemic worst. Chill. I’ve vaccinated. boosters needed later, I’ll get too. life’s short worry right Citation please.  I'm going try thank healthcare workers like thank Veterans. They've done much thanks get country honestly enough. say? article behind paywall dating apps use? creepy craving human interaction know good apps try. Yeah, draw much results confirm effectiveness vaccine probably somewhere 90's.  me. Yes rational sane leader knows that. true - studies showed multiple instances schools effective spreading, youngest children shed virus. studies showed \*children\* get severe cases, often asymptomatic. Spreading disease tired disease spreading.

Flawless logic. FDA announced willing look UK data part emergency authorization meets criteria use Thank Trump WarpSpeed! 

ENGAGE! parties bickering public. AstraZeneca’s chief executive Pascal Soriot reported as saying, “Our contract contractual commitment. It’s best effort.” response, the European Commissioner Stella Kyriakides says, “The view company obliged deliver **because signed ‘best effort’** agreement neither correct acceptable.” inclusion best-efforts obligation clearly advantage AstraZeneca. increases burden Commission prove company act normal, diligent forward-looking way,"" said Sébastien De Rey, researcher Leuven University, referring prevailing test best efforts Belgian law.

Both sides admit best effort within contract. meaning ""best effort"" they're questioning. course read contract. nothing I've said incorrect. UK throw tantrum Pfizer/Biontech lower deliveries estimated December/January, I'd expect EU act like adults. sabre-rattling cover fact slow ineffective acquiring vaccines last year. Smoke mirrors. easy throw blame foreign pharma company, cover ineptitude. remember said needed 500 million vaccines stop Ebola pandemic?  Children may mild symptoms parents don't. last checked school‐aged kids live parents.

And read article? They're trying reopen schools now, way teachers adults vaccine. mean, 16 days approve new vaccine seems reasonable me, possible given emergency Severe infection severe illness arent neccesarily thing. Severe illness may defined way, severe infection may defined viral loads Fortunately Norway far better situation EU UK far less infections CPA yet,king?  saying comment. already got Moderna vaccine bs German article 8% efficiency

You mean one cites German government sources? Seems like attack me. Well, soon fearmongering ends, admits: ""Vaccinated people pass Covid"", I'll hop right line. Okay, wait August whenever might able choose vaccine get 0% protection then. legitimate concern 3 months would optimistic timetable.

We kind vaccination rollout US UK experiencing right summer shortfalls delays announced.

Especially emergence new variants, highly doubt three months would enough even start see decline epidemic. entirely standing start, close. SARS-CoV-1 vaccine starting trials got repurchased SARS-CoV-2. mRNA treatments already starting early trials, mostly cancer treatment. One vaccine getting ready start trial like November 2019.

But absolutely amazing fast came speed many working candidates. Drug development usually fraught failures great job.

With mRNA working well, make future vaccine work much quicker easier well. need keep working production capacity hopefully storage requirements. situation Spain different countries. early pandemic non-medical masks undergo certification according UNE 0065:2020 guarantees similar filtering characteristics surgical masks. fact due better fit using elastic materials would venture many reusable masks sold Spain actually somewhere surgical FFP2 mask protection.

This different countries non-medical masks basically useless garbage. true non-certified masks also sold long time Spain (there stricter rules place clearer labelling), long use certified mask basically *are* using medical-grade mask. main difference official certification reusable masks medical use, reusable masks necessarily follow ""non-medical"" certification, mean bad. Hoping thats method countries go with, I'm 28 fit, relatively heathy would issues one mRNA proven superior. hope future vaccines use technology instead US. great low risk population countries cant store mRNA properly. Personally, happy got Moderna. amazing safety profile everyone get shots ASAP! almost there! approved, shot ordinary people get. think region-specific across US. IL, teachers currently getting vaccinated Group 1b (along anyone 65+). Group 1a frontline medical workers nursing home. feels right terms priorities, long ready move onto next group reasonable amount time passed (and wait fully finish groups starting next). I'm even referring recommendations RKI. 

German press ran stories citing government sources claiming vaccine efficacy level 10% elderly. means German government briefing press Oxford vaccine. 

If attack know is. Really stupid question:

Does getting vaccines utilize different strategies increase immunity?

If got cocktail J&amp;J Moderna, would double immune response?  get vaccinated, Fauci co say still pass friends family. thanks source

first one writes clearly hot debate interaction 5.1 &amp; 5.4

the second link lawyer anything legal related

third one writes he/she reads 5.4 as: ""I'd read meaning AZ use EU UK sites fulfilling BRE obligation."" following UK approach? That's good. limited supply right looking like vaccine war  think wait FDA reviews data know plan recommendations be. see talked lot, post viral syndrome something precedent certainly something wholly unique virus. certain degree expected, certain degree expected COVID. maybe argue may worse COVID, may likely, jury still out.  


I would careful concerned ""long COVID"", vaccines available gen. pop., want see post viral syndrome used rationale continuing business closures, restrictions association, event cancellations, etc. Yes pretty good point. Unfortunately, American media likes distort truth tend see anti-Zionism point anti-Semitism here. Thanks reply There’d eye jabbing lower leagues lol So, EU mean context? maybe something contract...

oh, yes, 5.4 Manufacturing Sites

So, even whole section clarify means. Now, let's Manufacturing Sites  shall use Best Reasonable Efforts manufacture vaccine manufacturing sites located EU (**which, purpose section 5.4 shall include United Kingdom**) may manufacture Vaccine non-EU facilitis, appropriate, accelerate supply Vaccine Europe...

What purpose section 5.4? define manufacturing sites whole contract, including section 5.1

So clearly EU 5.1 includes United Kingdom know take longer collect data, really need gauge various vaccines long term covid symptoms. makes plenty sense, thanks info include Palestinians? TON people don’t bother flu shot... obviously doesn't.

This stupid political games separatist Scottish first minister UK government (even damages Scottish national interest). you? came back problems USA economy ticket. 

Looking statistics arrivals see don’t even hit arrival cap weeks. It’s clear see. 

All book flight 6 weeks advance (just year get decent price). recommend flying Perth. Book directly airline, sky scanner type website. 

Also, sympathy flights cancelled. it’s majority all. Australian citizens legally able return home. cap averaged 4000 week almost year. 

From London there’s flight Perth 2200aud feb 7 every day March 7. get people see this. commitment vaccines come UK obviously. commitment deliver vaccines happen produced UK it. Moderna trial 30 severe COVID cases placebo group 0 vaccine group. believe n=14,073 n=14,134. key secondary end point evaluated efficacy mRNA-1273 preventing severe Covid-19. Thirty participants trial severe Covid-19; 30 placebo group (indicating vaccine efficacy 100% [95% CI, could estimated 1.0]), one death among participants attributed Covid-19 (Table S16). vaccine efficacy prevent Covid-19 consistent across subgroups stratified demographic baseline characteristics (Figure 4): age groups (18 &lt;65 years age ≥65 years), presence risk severe Covid-19, sex, race ethnic group (non-Hispanic White communities color).

I know criteria 'severe' identical trials, would check that. Also probably variants play Moderna trial data collected. useless. read reports, 66% average different types levels vaccine candidate 85 percent effective preventing severe disease across regions studied, [i] 28 days vaccination adults 18 years older. Efficacy severe disease increased time cases vaccinated participants reported day Janssen COVID-19 vaccine candidate demonstrated complete protection COVID-related hospitalization death, 28 days post-vaccination. clear effect vaccine COVID-19 cases requiring medical intervention (hospitalization, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)), reported cases among participants received Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, 28 days post-vaccination. make argument often assume person learning COVID quality before. fundamentally false. Poor communication ability, distancing requirements, different students teachers classrooms quarantining day, switching among person amd hybrid modes, teachers spread like 12 scenarios (in person / hybrid / virtual schedule + person / virtual plan students + students temporarily quantining / teacher temporarily quarantining) ... bit reduces overall quality burns teachers even faster. 

I visit schools area job. person school AWFUL right now. fun stuff allowed. sharing materials equipment, group activities, everyone desks time spread (not enough keep spreading anything mind you, class big room small, far enough pain ass) little plexiglas cubicles. plexiglas means can't see anything board past first row. Everything room day. going lunch art music PE. Teachers can't come near you. field trips assemblies special events. miserable. like think know what’s going considering live here. Yes, believe figure high 72% vaccine hesitant black individuals. Yeeeeah. Isn’t point? really need tickle g-spot people demand complete transmission prevention one rate unacceptable. get something sub par ? someone explain good news? 66% way lower hyped numbers aren’t *as* good still almost guarantee won’t die. still way better preventing severe illness. I’m saving cause don’t know find info. doubt it, US really needs vaccine asap expand vaccination capabilities. bad people still trying doom gloom variants. people realize even variants much worse, end year, majority people say fuck move lives year+ putting hold population australia 55th largest country world... new zealand 126th..nz well behind places like palestine...
When comes coronavirus, talking population land mass... People like terrified virus going away. love current environment leveled playing field. Everyone stuck home world chaos accomplishing anything perfectly acceptable.  virus gone, world go back was, people living lives, becoming happy, achieving things, person go back hating it. selfish mentality really. Ok, links presented provide little research backing claim mostly anecdotal stories. “Many people”? many many? sorry, it’s year. Use common sense. coming probably 100M cases United States. large portion people permanent damage disabilities, we’d hearing lot besides rare anecdotal story opinion piece.  66% effective SYMPTOMATIC illness 85% effective SEVERE illness. post needs removed.

Yeah, wondered that, thanks clarifying. course press leads grim numbers first. people realize Fauci employing “weakest link” technique throwing directives suggestions. Unfortunately, un/under-educated group majority far. Let’s face it, people could refer adequate medical training/understanding....reading garbage posts nurse friend’s fb post qualify one such. break seemingly extreme form....so morons uneducated/undereducated folks hopefully lightbulb-on moment least create worry urgency modulate behavior prevent spread. us wear masks, understand importance consistency letting guard down, get vaccinated etc, everything fine. That’s message for. It’s like saying...you’re strong weakest link. many complete morons see every day wearing masks, thinking infringes rights invincible even worse, believe “it’s hoax” moronism. wear masks, careful, avoid idiots, everything fine, beat this. need stress education perseverance. really encouraging results..Remember 66% effective preventing moderate severe disease 85% precent effective preventing severe cases hospitalizations vaccine group. 

Efficacy also increases time saw cases vaccine group 49 days. public health standpoint logistics standpoint vaccine perfect alternative people higher risk. 

I'm fairly young pretty much last line terms getting vaccine happily take instead wait year get pfizer moderna..  behind them, unnoticed unheard, worker protective gear goes entirely different task: disinfecting surfaces, collecting waste biohazard bags, unobtrusively inching past beds life-support machinery mop floor. feel “like smallest cog wheel, like nobody considers us,” one said shortly starting painstaking process donning protective gear enter ICU Sotiria Thoracic Diseases Hospital Athens, Greece’s main COVID-19 treatment center. Georgia Tsiolou, like AB started work Sotiria January 2020, months pandemic hit Greece, said authorities often speak hiring medical staff offering bonuses long-term contracts nurses doctors. Pretty much. sub likes act like wny vaccine 90% efficiency useless worth it. aslong prevents hispitlisation that's major win. mention vaccine tested along new variants unlike pfizer/moderna. alot robust data new variants single dose vaccine, single dose proven super effective COVID yet, 2nd dose quite bit effective Nope 90% first shot 10-14 days passed reason might also able get mRNA vaccine later time. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article think ad virus prevalent South Africa, common cold virus people built immunity response for. 

It also believed older get, chance immunity vector have, since could exposed harmless virus longer period time. here. I'm glad J&amp;J tried sounds slightly better flu shot. 

Since better vaccines made I'll wait them. made 2 dose vaccine then. scoring J&amp;J getting f c. Since got amazing numbers first; we’re like why?? focus efforts funding increasing production Pfizer Moderna vaccines instead? want get it, would rather good protection ASAP rather great protection months later. wait choose vaccine get, going waiting much longer get one. knew JJ get near 90% effectiveness (being single shot all) really hoping something 80%. 75%+ would still acceptable but..... 66%?? 

Which means basically useless new strains become dominant one. Seriously disappointing. needed every vaccine bring A-game, looks like far Pfitzer Moderna showed up. require referral testing? tests expensive somebody thinks may sick, getting tested help reduce spread. Yes correct metroplex live in, students failed rate 2-8% 2019 (in school), 2020 failed rate 45-55% learning remotely. Remote learning either perfected work well teaching model. Yeah lot people don’t realize fall outside 66%, you’re probably getting bad cold. better than, know, dying pneumonia. 

What concern well work newer Brazilian South African strains.  Remember 1 shot vaccine--moderna/pfizer 1 shot efficacy potentially similar efficacy. 

I think make conclusion juncture key quote one reporting title this

"" day 28, one got vaccinated needed hospitalization died regardless whether exposed ""regular COVID particularly nasty variants, vaccinated become infected, milder illness. ""

I would like detail defines mild, sounds pretty close 100% efficiency 30 days me. get shot stay locked another month. 

Those higher risk 65, essential workers, get mRNA vaccines. us home anyway, people 20's pretty good. Yea it’s basically “non racist” way grouping white majority, non Russian/Soviet nations, lumping together developed group countries worth noting Black South Asian minorities UK *much* lower this. Older Black men particular overwhelmingly anti-vax. government resort ad campaigns, get BAME leaders/celebs try convince safe. Exactly. February going shit, getting logistics place, March begin picking steam it'll FULL SPEED AHEAD that. US already enough Pfizer Moderna every adult July. Adding J&amp;J mix means complete vaccinations weeks earlier. saving much time vaccine, losing lot effectiveness. data used compare various policies? insane! feel proud hard scientists globally worked this. made many effective vaccines short period time, pipeline, incredible feat exactly equivalent rate distrust offered it. Don’t forget East Jerusalem residents aren’t citizens also offered vaccine. Missing critical word headline, methinks! 
\- Australia effectiveness found 66% global scale. expecting better rate honestly. robust data. Pfizer/moderna tested new variants Moderna say they're developing new booster south african variant already. LOL. we’re lucky even couches. May interpreting contract skivvies duvet. It’s good importantly basically 100% prevents death. concerns well work Brazilian SA strains may sign what’s come virus continues evolve. article mention behavior; masked, socially distanced, etc., statistic devoid anything bare number, without context, worthless. real question is: chance vaccine cause autoimmune issues line? mRNA vaccine training immune system recognize sequence spike found outer portion coronavirus, chance body mistake similar sequences covid one later cause overreaction? long term effects vaccine people existing autoimmune conditions still seen yet. may find doses high confer protection beyond 1-3 year time frame. UK left EU 1 Jan 2020. parties agreed 'transitional arrangements' would apply things like trade free movement would work, apply interim whilst negotiated permanent long-term relationship. transitional period ended. love pollyanna comments great get upvoted literally worse worst vaccine data far, taking Crown trouble AZ trial results.

This straight awful. People talking 40s getting this, 20s only? Fauci must get tired moving goalposts around time. agree. see zero reason continue dragging EUA good efficacy data plus Novavax AstraZeneca UK. months trials finish US. Meanwhile, variants continue pop thousands continue die. hope people realize cancer could forming inside even inside homes to. Pfizer reported 1 severe infection. reading comprehension... AZ clearly breach 6.3 I'd say. One week delivery commenced sound like timely notifications me. What's lead time growing viruses? fuck batches one plant discovered last week? single case trials, sure bud. Anders ? Says person covered dog food! wonder they'd actually export vaccine need people propaganda reasons?

Russia currently 0.7 % coverage, EU member states 2.0-2.8 %. Seems even relatively slow Pfizer deliveries, EU still better Russia. AstraZeneca begin deliveries, too, even they're smaller expected. Hi, new sub get shot #1 Novavax trial today.

I understand everyone excited lack hospitalizations J&amp;J hopefully that's true Novavax SA variant well bigger study.

My question is: worry people getting long-hauler symptoms effects still catching COVID since we'll still roughly 40% chance catching COVID SA strain spreads rapidly US? I'm young never personally worried risk death hospitalization honest always scared talk long-term lung capacity diminishment, long-haulers, long-lasting effects. perfect world yes. real world move. clock racing isn’t virus it’s exhaustion. isn’t realistic expect people hold like 2022 perhaps beyond I’ve heard dismissively stated it’s big deal. 
A vaccine like prevents hospitalizations highly valuable. Thank confirming experience contracts providing services although area want something guaranteed never put ""best reasonable efforts"" ""best efforts"". That's vague term big grey area contract interpreted many ways. seems silly move EU. Teachers *and families* need vaccinations. AZ EU could something useful mitigate pandemic instead public tantrum row. apply next week, there's chance get approval point February right?  wonder FDA new vaccines. Keep going Moderna Pfizer suggest younger people get JNJ Oxford ones

Glad decision haha read article says got extra shot would gone bad. GMAFB. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* AZ obvious, source  1/3 chance getting COVID. 1/3 chance *if exposed*, opposed 100% unvaccinated. exposed, 1/3rd, also much less likely get severely sick die.

It beats hell vaccinated. Id take it, better nothing. talking about?

nobody restricting commence, EU already made clear that

their conflict AZ, UK **Prediction:** Mask &amp; distancing compliance going tank hard get around 30-40% vaccinated. 

Businesses already can't enforce this. Law enforcement can't enforce it. understanding expolatory talks finalized deal yet. Please correct source I'm wrong. that.it choice That’s 3600. 
That’s 7 day moving average toward end last year. 
Better “it’s over” Getting first dose Moderna Monday! job interacting lot people great since health issues might higher risk according CDC. Yes. But......they lied people. honest would better. lost lot credibility lot damage lying Nothing conclusive yet, initial data Israel super promising front. good chance they, least, drastically reduce spread. EU still exporting vaccines places around world. Even UK.

The EU simply threatened stop exports UK since suspect UK basically made AstraZeneca steal pre-produced vaccine doses paid made EU.

Pfizer still sends doses Belgium e.g. Canada, Switzerland maybe even US (not sure that, definitely beginning).

So saying ""should've produced vaccines then"" misleading. We're producing vaccines, also producing many countries. Start Home Depot. many people masks mouth/nose Home Depot Palm Beach. Right, question is: ""Is really severe going hospital?""

I mean, that's personal threshold severe. saying evidence that's government wants believe?

How workplaces driving infections? keep hearing clusters meatpacking plants, warehouses, mail sorting centers, etc...That conclusion Canada least. I'm sure socializing help, there's reason believe people hanging what's driving pandemic, would caution mentality, sooner later, people start shaming others daring go see loved ones, even precautions....meanwhile, Amazon stuffing 1000+ workers cafeteria give shit deliver stupid shit less 48 hours. guess let's wait see actual lawyers say, next step. ""Johnson &amp; Johnson’s one-shot vaccine generated strong protection Covid-19 large, late-stage trial, raising hopes rapidly reshape stumbling immunization campaign.

In 44,000-person study, vaccine prevented 66% moderate severe cases Covid-19, according company statement Friday. particularly effective stopping severe disease, preventing 85% severe infections 100% hospitalizations deaths.

“If prevent severe disease high percentage individuals, alleviate much stress human suffering” pandemic, said Anthony Fauci, top U.S. infectious-disease official, briefing results company government officials"" bad cold possibly permanent lung organ damage + long covid.

There's evidence among people received vaccine trials. So, EU mean context? Maybe something contract...

oh, yes, section 5.4 Manufacturing Sites

So, even whole section clarify means. Now, let's Manufacturing SitesAstraZeneca shall use Best Reasonable Efforts manufacture vaccine manufacturing sites located EU (**which, purpose section 5.4 shall include United Kingdom**) may manufacture Vaccine non-EU facilitis, appropriate, accelerate supply Vaccine Europe...

What **purpose** section 5.4? clarify questions manufacturing sites whole contract, including section 5.1

So clearly EU 5.1 includes United Kingdom Even vaccine 50% effective young population virus able spread. 50 underlying health conditions, need vaccine 95% effectiveness. still prefer Moderna Pfizer offer protection especially variants like SA one, J&amp;J well against. 

It's like choosing XBox Series X Series S. rational sane leader going adopt eradication strategy unless want financial ruin, kill entire industries ban tourism decades. Daily reminder smallpox took almost 500 years eradicate. sophisticated enough me. vaccine sold cost they're making money it. 

We know *all* contracts. specifically UK contracts kept secret. surprise pay more.

If really pragmatic decision due long time took EMA approve, AZ say so? weaseling?  tone comment simply disgusting. EU pushing vaccines equal distribution. Otherwise would sending vaccines Afghanistan, Nigeria, etc 170 countries vaccines vaccinated no-one far. really dislike movies not, real leadership looks like. 1) Palestinian territory occupied Israel since 1967.
2) many Palestinians go work daily either Israel proper Israeli settlements. Refusing give vaccines isn’t human rights violation Palestinians [(it’s literally violation Geneva it’s even risking state’s Israeli citizens’ health order continue subordination occupied subjects. Phil Philippines? Hopefully little clear detailed results published FDA can't absolutely anything right. even hold press conference time.

Of course hours weekend best time this. Certainly hekp distribution. listened conference call. said cases vaccination group resulted hospitalization death.

Results consistent across age groups (I believe third trial 60+).

Furthermore, conducted study across 3 continents test variants. Regardless infection rate variant, 85% protection severe illness consistent.

They track provide 100 million doses US end June 1 billion worldwide end year. believe cost $10 per shot stored normal freezer temperatures. production capacity combined cost ease transport make huge impact across world. Also absolutely agreed. guess meant say simply criticize Israeli government way would government – show blatant anti-Semitism. AZ's supply contract UK issue. issue EU manufacturing facilities used satisfy Clause 5.1 producing hoped capacity.  Also much better UK, Italy, Spain, Belgium, well, half Europe. Countries draconian -- useless -- measures. true cost deforestation. looks like nature fights back. That's wrote, hospitalizations. Perhaps 450million people pissed EU bulldozed individual nations' (and groups nations) attempts secure vaccines thoroughly buggered up? think circumstances led people moving direction  mean it'll likely still required stores etc, I'd surprised see lot people wearing private settings.   Okay, thank you.

Didn't know bigger report WaPo link going press release. Unfortunately enough random people Twitter think way collectively really dumb things. would hilarious estimated delivery schedule lower EU said would be. Seems weird redact leave base amounts public. 

I get redacting cost side. looks like elected decision maker likes voted job. That’s choice rational sane leader going indefinite lockdown kill entire industries. Yes mandatory. 3M's KN95 cost around 20 cents wholesale China. Buy hundred million give people instructions prevent leakage. definitely makes even confusing appear say people got severe infections definition require hospitalization, also prevented 100% hospitalizations. Well forgot Canada also comparable western country....

South Korea Japan heavily westernized, Japan pulled back (and rest Asia westernized bit) recent decades. S. Korea straddles eastern western worlds Japan fallen line rest Asia (more, rest Asia met Japan middle).

WRONG! **purpose** 5.4

Now purpose 5.4? Let's **Manufacturing Sites**

It literally section manufacturing sites know requested it. know parties agreed it. statistics show number people Sweden died Covid-19. That's everyone died testing positive virus; mean virus cause death cases.

Yes, method countries use. Belgium uses ever encompassing method counting deaths. include people didnt test positive covid suspected covid, top counting deaths countries do, said original countries, including Spain, Italy England, currently include deaths take place inside hospitals official tolls. 

This incorrect btw, least UK counts includes deaths take place outside hospital. think issue article date, think even April date UK counting deaths - early pandemic hospital deaths included.

Article continues  wow, thanks love. /s I’ve working district hybrid since September, know several teachers districts continue teach virtually, one said love staying home hope continue teaching virtually indefinitely. Teachers desperately want back classroom, many districts don’t funds put safety measures place. simply fortunate enough work one able upgrade HVAC system, provide funding regular testing, etc.

There always arguments deserving something supply limited single right way decide. Haha.. 

Can't come counter argument tell I'm 8th grade tell right. Sad predictable, mostly sad. said US. work mental health poor state area, many resources available individuals. We've people specifically told move wealthy states many resources there's less poverty. cannot said Native American reservations here.

And anyone argues me.. Yes, US healthcare system terrible could across board low SES Americans. fact remains poor Americans many resources available communities Native Americans living reservations. You’re long outrage short data course : 13.1 (e) Hello Canada, also frail older people would like protect vaccines purchased Living California, I'm really, really scared variants mean getting back normal.

It sounds like vaccinate vulnerable groups deaths hospitalizations go flu levels--*even with* variants. I'm taking precautions then, especially J&amp;J speed process.

But looks like public health narrative ""until severe disease prevented."" ""until herd immunity."" new variants emerging, we're going get complete herd immunity. mention additional narrative we'll also need *preemptive* public health measures protect *future* variants.

My biggest fear permanent shutdowns businesses. permanent modifications eliminate beauty serendipity world replace sterility. Permanent mask mandates, ""it's piece cloth."" Permanent plexiglass barriers. Permanent ""protocols."" *A safe dystopia.* could wait vaccines prevent severe disease treat like flu *becomes* like flu due vaccines.

I want live way forever. California makes masks long-term new normal, either variants continue render unattainable elusive ""herd immunity"" criterion over, preemptive need prevent new variants (which due cells unlikely go around killing vaccinated people), plan giving job (which probably make come back in-person, masks) move South Dakota, public health measures all. That's say approve South Dakota handled pre-vaccination phase pandemic, think disease brought flu levels vaccines states continue ""new normal"" others already back normal, normality correct policy.

I'll move another state. I'll give job, considered ""good"" job. I'll give everything.

All normal life. feel like third biggest part problem past several months (the first two product shortages amount misinformation there) way things worded TV news articles virus.

There much talk ""stopping spread"", zero talk protect get it. I'm someone naturally skeptical government, overwhelming silence important things made really uneasy beginning.

Severe side effects definitely worry, surprised friend mine much anti-vaxxer concerned getting his.

But point is, die this. Getting virus, can. Vaccination surprisingly good situation vaccines EU. 3rd place EU vaccination per 100 people. used Pfizer doses(650k). Moderna 15k doses, still unused. polls december less 50% people said want vaccinate. percent go 60% 10-15% undecided. It’s something could every day though. 

School starts certain time test every single kid. Imagine carpool line wait 15 mins car test results come back. need get drunk fun. Especially concerts festivals. reason. Covid spreading like wildfire United States last January February cases tripling every week. atomic bomb reaching critical mass mad director telling us worry plutonium core starting compressed implosion. 

There two major factors past new infection peak:

1) 40-60% people taking smart measures protect getting infected (state dependent places like Vermont best Dakotas giving F). 

2) majority 40-60% people either choose care high-risk work environments come Covid longer helping spread. Repeat me. SCIENCE. DOES. NOT. WORK. THAT. 

YES DOES! NOTHING TEST! **You want test immune system works times, that's bullshit.**  answer partisanism abolish plurality voting. needed Ranked Choice STAR literally anything else would destroy two party system well partisanism. missed whole second part post, you? quoted literally confirms said. 

And yes include CMOs UK. can't include AZ's facility UK CMO already pre-existing contract. Guardian article recently posted r/Europe says this:

Sandra Gallina, EC's Director General Health Food Safety, ""dived customs records find evidence AstraZeneca shipped EU-produced doses UK – without success.""  anyone thinks wrestling good idea right beyond me... 

They're opening school sports district, including wrestling. 

No chorus. band. 

Kids must wear masks stay 6' apart. 

We can't share supplies, even swap seats cross contamination. 


But wrestle WITHOUT MASKS. 


Sure. seems logical. 


/s It’s like 15 minutes result. 

I mean, better know? That’s rational line thinking. depends vaccine manufacturers able successfully ramp up. current rate vaccines shipped, happen. Moderna, Pfizer Johnson&amp;Johnson seem bullish ability deliver late spring. expect get drunk. idea fun. worry toilet paper supply best day 😂 virus keeps spreading, keep changing. Vaccines required yearly unless stop spread. hope enjoy crashing economy. full data Russian vaccine though? Saying Astrazeneca's one tested transparent environment euphemism. saying Gamaleya's can't effective, now, clear information Good news: J&amp;J classifying moderate covid anyone two symptoms. seems like under-sell encompasses lot people would consider mild 

Also helpful brain works like mine:
- 66% efficacy = 75% cases came placebo group 
- 57% efficacy = 70% cases came placebo group shall use Best Reasonable Efforts **to contract with** proposed CMOs [by EU] increase available manufacturing capacity within EU [including UK, given 5.4]. manufacturing site planning set Schedule A.

Schedule also refers UK sites. depends lot local conditions resources, measures seem bit nebulous. hoping access production numbers Moderna/Pfizer don't, sees reason optimism. not, agree - discussing possible timeline come back bite timeline slips. haven’t really addressed points above, you’re asserting it’s crystal clear clearly isn’t (we wouldn’t conversation was), point I’ll bow out. Thanks conversation - position you’ve put think best line EU take (and seems wholly unconvincing me, hey ho). great weekend. well could be. least point it’s available everybody then. wouldn’t clog pipes people don’t really “need” you’re still working rest phases already determined. Vote feet. qualify money

What money? even stipulated criteria would pretend like normal situation take context pandemic equally ridiculous

It matter. long term effects still well pandemic number 1 priority minimizing loss life, keeping nation healthy. deal economic issues after.

""Economic issues"" also result death, know seem endless amounts “handouts” comes bailing businesses never anything help Americans.

Who think businesses made of? Work works them? ""Americans"" ""businesses"" mutually exclusive things. saw really good comment /r/science weeks back.

You know write ""quirks"" older people like hoarding obsessing minimizing waste saying, ""They grew depression""? future generations kids ""quirks"" things like obsessive sanitation, agoraphobia, stunted social development. also least bit surprised learn masks negative impact development children. rise teen suicides also extremely alarming.

I'd speculate two ways pandemic going affect kids:

1. Children poorer working class parents going fall behind school, since remote learning obviously hurts children wealthy parents remote jobs. kids missed full year education likely never catch back up. cycle poverty continues.

2. Children ""responsible"" parents going grow sorts mental issues. Teens fear intimacy close social interaction. Children fear strangers crowds general. Kids develop extreme levels attachment parents since they've sides 24/7 last year. Think kids 2 3 start pandemic spent year impressionable time lives told avoid others limit interactions, barely even going outside. expert think 2022 unlikely. totally unsustainable economically current measures last year headline bit misleading. treatments mentioned article “drink water” “have tried yoga?” use rapid tests. 

Ok what’s turnaround those? 

You going stick room wait get cleared? they’re near other

Well whole area would likely get contact traced congrats good portion school out. wanted clarify conditions necessarily mean get vaccine. 

It’s doctor. Yes, definitely agree that! &lt;3 Doc Oc Wow, good way describe it. Despite extremely wealthy part world, really cheapskates. J&amp;J vaccine may one feel comfortable taking Bc health issues Covid let go essentially going die without treatment. Otherwise stay home. question wondering day. 600 million vaccine listed Pfizer Moderna? due available summer?

Because yes, HUGE sigh relief. want get one those! wait July means get one effective kind. I've worried going enough. Then, I'm sorry assuming that. large number people even want try wear masks help easy time lump everyone together accident. mistake part, though.

At time, personally vastly prefer wearing masks could happen otherwise, others come contact with. fighting masks. fighting giving government complete control deciding live lives. mean, technically yes? strictly looking pandemic, we've suffered casualties 90% countries world No. group getting called mass vaccination sites probably weeks. Exactly would said (if understood well you!). Probably significant differences relative others. doubt magnitude super high though, given many students impacted probably accommodations help mitigate impact. still spreads. still mutate. Immunity lessen body time. 

Letting shit keep going huge mistake huge failure vaccine. goalposts moved daily. Darwinism. I’ve heard “we need test stadiums, schools, etc.” like people don’t understand logistical challenge all. doesn't, obliges use BREs engage CMOs chosen EU. wording. reason rabies vaccines like 5 shots. produce absolute maximum amount protection. North Dakota implemented mask mandate cases high.  mask use increased 38% 67%.  

And know words per capita mean? There's lot people California. North Dakota one hardest hit places earth 127,887 cases per million vs California's 82,679 cases per million. Deaths 1,862 per million North Dakota vs 1,007 per million California. 

From numbers, state ""out control""? reason, can't exactly say reason without blowing cover. obviously known anyone covid. hospitalized unless point need essentially ICU alive.

These people would never home state prior this. 10 months me. בכיף😜
לדעתי שתי האופציות קבילות, אך אני הייתי אומר “לאוזן ישראלית״ שכן זה יותר כללי. 

ממליץ לך לתרגם את שני הביטויים לאנגלית (מבחינת משמעות, לא מילה במילה) וכך תוכל לבחור מה נשמע לך יותר נכון:

1. נשמע מוזר לאוזן ישראלית- sounds weird Israeli person 
2. נשמע מוזר לאוזן הישראלית- sounds weird Israeli person

שני המשפטים נכונים, תבחר במה שנשמע לך נכון יותר.


דבר נוסף- יש לומר ״לימדת אותי״ ולא ״לימדת לי״.

״לי״ זה me, 
״אותי״ זה me. public health: oh can't live isolation ten months??? fucking MURDERER

I actually saw someone claiming public health literally saying this. Doctors think black influencer also risk group? Kinda weird.  surprised UK wanted out.

I bet European people won’t stand continues it’s necessary. year late. think public going put another year quarantine virus mutating. viruses mutate time, surprise various strains going around. Typically mutate contagious less deadly. Unless find one mutating deadly, think realistic, long term. Testing contact tracing palatable locking people hotel rooms? Sounds insane. I'm sure can.

But experience yours, everyone's. blanket assumptions people like also wearing wearing correctly flawed. I'm thinking awful abroad covid hit.. people allowed return homes, families.. even pets. saying done anything differently.. thinking lost -I'd- kept away home. 😬 wanted clarify conditions necessarily mean get vaccine. course doctor tells to, follow direction, sources recommending it. want people thinking get one conditions. School learning. School teacher discipline kid try get pay attention, get care grades, get stop clowning. That's job parent. school nudge someone things, sure. barely ever works unless parent applies pressure anyways.

Anyways I'm talking kids who's parents obviously abdicated responsibilities name comfort happen lot appears least increasing. example parents get angry schools students score poorly behave poorly. teacher teach, kid needs want learn well. Schools encourage extent ultimately societies relied parenting drive that. school equipped parent 20+ people class. simply cannot happen. fact burden put upon schools results worsened education others classroom time spent teachers disciplining instead teaching.

This zero elitism. simply point families putting far much strain teachers frankly paid enough teach parents kids. absurd thought expect to.

Will going back school help? Yes. real issue afflicting kids different remote schooling? Also yes. worsened remote schooling.

I'm saying remote schooling great must keep it. saying parents seemingly desperate get kids back school wrong reasons. Sometimes selfish reasons. No. vector vaccine modification possible, get immunity vector. 

Biontech Moderna vaccines crucial fir humans. Hi, hope keeping well safe crazy times. usually comment I've I'd like understand point view bit detail.

The UK government gets money taxes paid UK citizens companies purchase vaccine doses, (I think) government UK intends see needs citizens priority.

I'm two minds myself. voted remain, I'm pro contributing EU elsewhere possible get virus control (as, obviously, virus gives shits arbitrary lines maps), also, objectively, UK really shit right high number new cases deaths per mil/pop - surely vaccine methods concentrated afflicted areas put fires priority, UK certainly one burning hot right now.

Could elaborate point view? something I'm missing? Virus bad. buy stocks. many areas unless need ICU moment hospital take you; even room. Many people suffer severe Covid home. 

This case essentially beginning. Post viral syndrome associated severe cases, e.g. ICU. Vaccines awesomely good job preventing severe SX. seems say reasonably, vaccines put significant dent ""long COVID"". 

Even still *some* cases *some* level ""long COVID"", becomes difficult rationalize defend blunt mitigation measures kind we're seeing vaccines widespread widely available. 

To get truly accurate data ""long COVID"" need sort longitudinal study- take years.  way many long term issues mild cases say right attitude. Exactly that’s controlling exports now, suspicion 4 million UK’s doses actually came EU. Easy:

As guy got Pfizer, waited 7 days 2nd shot simply TF point? Came far, May well wait full protection since MPRE coming.

Same J&amp;J. 28 days shot 1 full protection hospital great protection even getting severe. 

Point is, coming, may well wait Pfizer... coming stall 66% disease, 85% severe 100% hospital death.... start back protection maximizes. obliges enter contracts manufacturers expand capacity, including within UK.

That onerous clause AZ. know people teachers noticed substantial decline students work ethnic many even show virtual learning even pay attention. Closing schools going zoom learning history one dumbest policy decisions time. get choice tho, man oh man. They've produced them, never made FDA trials even though promising. misleading, important info New Zealand. outbreak care severe disease. need vaccine stops 90% people spreading disease can't re-open borders. vaccine pre-purchased doses of, clearly job. Great news places giant acute outbreaks, good news NZ, Australia, Taiwan. 5.4 clearly states AZ shall cannot manufacture deliver according 5.1, use UK plants CMOs may suggested. torturing reading. crystal clear. 

The reason UK explicitly included 5.4 entitled “manufacturing sites” painfully obvious, deals situation AZ cannot manufacture vaccine EU. exact situation now. stroke, lung damage, brain fog, loss smell? Imagine energy flu vaccine. 3million vaccinate today? Let's goooooooooo lol.

&amp;#x200B;

These great numbers know hit 2mn. Would love it. gave cold example symptoms similar. least them. happen around lot people, yeah, wear mask two. alone beach park, fine without one, know made argue about. one dose two dose regimens always going tested. one dose bet would still work, looks like bet paid off. Two dose might end getting EUA line, see scenario J&amp;J's one dose approved given data circumstances next weeks. That's ridiculous, imo. disagree, valid argument.

You evidence claim.  Yikes I’m sure there’s one single way, got first dose got little card gave name. I’m sure system place get people booster. Countries like Germany Netherlands losing shit, almost think Europe scared open. see totally fine. need vaccines market still good enough. enough supply types cover everyone, even 60-90 percent effective range, that's enough kick shit curb. Salvation mankind almost here. sure disgusting right word. People dying. mean US awful pandemic, Trump good anything throwing money people/companies deal issues. cold related COVID same. vaccine common cold likely impossible. attempted multiple times scientists gave deeming fruitless endeavor. honestly never heard know, I'm american.

a) target effect cytokine neutralized 50% wells or
b) infectivity 100 (Median Tissue Culture Infectious Dose) TCID50 appropriate wild-type virus neutralized 50% wells (see Simmons et.al.) clearly states Moderna’s data 6.4-fold reduction using mutations psuedovirus used vaccine (mRNA-1273). bet right. I’ve hearing trials set study transmission, efficacy preventing infection, can’t say one way another better safe sorry data in.

I remember beginning pandemic, people already scare mongering you’ll prove vaccination status get certain places hired. new way classifying people — vaccinated unvaccinated. 

I don’t want this, also don’t want people lying vaccinated they’re not. matter happens, it’s going problematic level. We’ve already seen stupid selfish neighbors be. 72% effective moderate severe infections. getting virus spreading it. That's I'm saying this. problem particular kind ""corporate"" California corporate democrats are, tech companies. tech companies definitely vested interest requiring permanent masks since freely seeing people's faces high-bandwidth social interaction, permanent masks makes easier tech platforms like Zoom compete meatspace bandwidth. Got it. pulled ideas butt based real facts. needs studied, agree, I'm scared it. I'm far frightened concerned rising numbers child abuse that's seen worldwide.

Regardless, we're going see high vaccination numbers young kids year. said, vaccines cut transmission (and there's real reason believe don't) again, fear becomes even *less* likely. Fear substitute science. get infected viruses bacteria time, get sick. viruses cause disease ton different reasons. never cause disease, cause disease *you* whatever reason, would cause disease, missing another virus bacteria fungus virus needs cause disease. even, *do* specific virus, get disease. 

Like asymptomatic cases. get infection, virus replicates them, symptoms.

No, Though recent studies varied methods, findings similar: **infected children much, more, coronavirus upper respiratory tracts infected amount virus found children — viral load — correlated severity symptoms. words, virus mean severe Finding high amounts viral genetic material — studies measured viral RNA, live virus — kids prove children infectious. However, **presence high viral loads infected children increase concern children, even without symptoms, could readily spread infection fewer children sick COVID-19 compared adults, children infected virus causes COVID-19, get sick COVID-19, spread virus causes COVID-19 others. **Children, like adults, COVID-19 symptoms (“asymptomatic”) still spread virus others.** $2000 (the cost hotel) isn’t much money rich/elite.

Places like Athens Paris Rome Barcelona depend heavily tourism banning would quickly tank economies. moderna never made anything prior 2020 either, mind us real risk dying, even get vaccine, could kill others. would when? Summer? Fall? technically correct, yes, there's deadly virus deliberately delaying vaccine deliveries months, vulnerable people die time without vaccines.

I’m talking indoor dining. restaurant serving indoors even though yet allowed numbers still high. possibility completely eliminating virus went away long time ago.  “Please dont peddle propaganda blood primary ones suffering concrete jungles.” saw bunch people outdoor dining umbrellas rain jackets rain. Tables taken too. Pretty ridiculous. Today big freaking day!

The vaccine landscape less set. focus attention getting shots arms looking plan return full normalcy.

The cards less table now, there’s way us regular folks. Looks like EU negotiators let AZ mislead them.

While think better world, AZ would upfront existing delivery commitments presented realistic production schedule instead conning 336 million Euros advance payment EU, clearly EU fault primarily.

Signing contract scale situation grave ""in good faith"" unprofessional. So, sad truth want make sure say ""f*k you, got mine"" times crisis, least cutthroat whoever want stuff whoever competing with. Well, goes official vaccination timeline Canada.

FUCK.

Over last days, Pfizer Moderna said they'd cutting Canada's shipments. this... might show pity send juuuust enough vaccines cover critical population, rest wait whole lot longer we'd thought.

The official plan start phase 3 vaccination (general public, free all) August-September. timeline likely met now. October? November? January 20-fucking-22? tell millions people lockdowns last another year good German friends decided they'd rather share vital vaccines deadly virus? keep people giving fuck up, throwing towel, going full-on YOLO instead spending another whole year hermits?

How? Just... how? Board members. 

I investments I’m talking myself. 

You realize something like 60 percent Americans live paycheck paycheck. Can’t afford invest money work jobs offer 401ks benefits matter. 

The stock market means dick Americans. money given corporations reach them. death really people fear this? that's kind absurd. Almost everyone developed nations .5% dying vaccinated soon disease survived, passed. 

Basically one care aspect disease, do, realize horrible things covid lungs heart knows else, sometimes months (and possibly longer learn more). Possibly permanent lung damage. know two people still struggling cough deep breaths months getting would considered moderate case.

This really good news many think is. can't speak US, UK gov't attitude much ""it'd stupid try nickel-and-dime this, given overpayment dwarfed cost even one additional day lockdown"".  Fucking disgusting. know great. know ever closed outdoor dining. nice meet friends pretty big deal Novavax providing half India's vaccines feel like truly feel ""over"" we're able that. Masks become far symbolic I'm sure going viewed scariest time recent history.  CA run lockdown enthusiasts. run corporate democrats. We'll open back hospitalizations drop, already, guarantee you. think excessive stop listening masse. Chances getting passed soon effect need get info there, regardless, RCV passed Maine states believe. enough evidence you, amigo? Uh...Did point? honestly can't tell wrote. Great news! cool, rather able catch direct flight LA beach Mexico get drunk ocean cheap margaritas day. guess can, have, gone shop so. We've got online shopping.

I'd easily sacrifice months total freedom save lives. mostly stay hole right too, even though I'm allowed go outside Yes data showing reduction efficacy highlighting much. reductions antibody levels - one important part system entire system. Nothing links suggests 6 fold reduction effectiveness change neutralization levels. Look closer SA data fun play CI makes hard draw significant conclusions from.

The reality positive news dark place covid lately understand believe heading towards good place covid even without boosters coming. first link: reserved right done. like export control now: able get overview everything goes right. case massive price wars protective clothing started started implementing way possibly stop it.

To second: trying take ordered them. EU wants ensure contracts fullfilled. know US states adopted strategy? Publishers manipulating market  Nearly 3,000 librarians, academics students signed open letter calling public investigation 

Saved click likely given doses vaccine produced far. What's basic logic? Kids spread disease? Alrighty then. I'm US gyms open. doesn’t. said requires contract - said requires “engage with” them. said that, no, requires contract them.

You're getting stuck irrelevant word. shows don’t understand drug manufacture works. UK facilities we’re talking CMOs: Cobra Biologics, Oxford Biomedica CP Pharmeceuticals.

Yes understand that. EU power say company must work AstraZeneca. say AZ must work company mutual cooperation.

Ultimately can't force AZ work companies already contracts place EU power force AZ break. give raises nothing ever comes chute workers.

Who getting raise *if workers?* Also, everyone mutual fund benefits it. one? Several? 401k? Notice goes every year? Yeah. Pfizer paper read (it's medrxiv phase 1 trials wanna dig it) noted milder side effects almost certainly come weaker immune response. immune system decays age. also flu shots less effective seniors CDC recommends stronger 2-dose seasonal flu shot older risk groups. seem able read today. still can't find equivalent percentage unvaccinated got infected hospitalized. Ahwhatever, we'll know soon. second part concerning me. whole lives ahead want lose permanent lung capacity, damaged organs severely reduce quality life. news making big deal every new variant, variants normal. Viruses mutate. That’s do. need pay attention unless something radically changes. 

I know mean becoming permanent dystopia. wear mask stores would like wearing mask prevent spreading illnesses become normalized, hope masks aren’t made mandatory forever. 

I don’t want pandemic create generation germaphobes. improves overall hygiene habits, great. don’t want overcorrect sterile direction. want get back people feel comfortable touching — inappropriate ways — humans need basic human contact sort ways.

We see unfolds. new normal. Hopefully new normal permanent dystopia. logic RNA confused DNA causes fear DNA mutated. reality it’s mRNA body quickly destroy mRNA programs cell injected make SARS Cov2 spike proteins. It’s transitory - long term response immune cells recognize SARS CoV2 spike protein. 

There’s virus vector non-human animal proteins raise secondary immune response. honesty - seems like vaccine would least likely cause long term harm. think thats fair compromise. ""responsible"" parents going grow sorts mental issues. Teens fear intimacy close social interaction. Children fear strangers crowds general. Kids develop extreme levels attachment parents since they've sides 24/7 last year. Think kids 2 3 start pandemic spent year impressionable time lives told avoid others limit interactions, barely even going outside. 

This is, almost word-for-word, story life. grow pandemic, obviously, extremely shy ages described marginally improved decades since. I'm 24, almost 25, honestly say friends. friends I've past like acquaintances. one thing going well school got good job financially independent. I'm suicidal is, least would almost certainly dead now. worry future kids. Back December UK faced issues EU facing now, except UK 40 million short. 

This long EU authorized vaccine (they today) even officially settled order. reason EU facing issues completed contracts 3 months later countries, Uk included.

Please stop trying drag UK issue solely EU AZ, uninvolved. Yes. that. Build new nursing home COVID-infected patients, designate one nursing home (or several) COVID home move everyone else. better killing neighbors COVID, still far cheaper lot we've done. possible 2 weeks ago, cases still raging, deaths time highs vaccine poor rollout. Something smells fishy here. friend got unblinded informed receiving Moderna. given placebo.

To add: knew placebo didn’t reaction whatsoever 

I bummed lol purrrr 5.4 explicitly refers doses next page... 5.4 explicitly refers doses next page... Yep. remains unchecked kids, despite low levels illness, still tons hosts mutate possibly affecting adults again. we're gonna kill it. Let's kill dead. Congratulations demonstrating idea talking about. Yes got huge downvoters idk why. Thought reasonable question.

10% long term sounds right, maybe low course correlated hospitalization holy hell even 5% long term stress people out. Great news! Go full speed. know fact got placebo unblinded went get Moderna. I’m still participating study, though encouraged What's difference disease infection? 

This key question wondering never thought articulate properly, thank asking often first step, occurs bacteria, viruses microbes cause disease enter body begin multiply. Disease occurs cells body damaged — result infection — signs symptoms illness appear. understanding sars-cov-2 virus could get body even start multiplying antibodies got vaccine would put stop infection enough damage become actual disease, sometimes possibly fast enough might get mild disease, basically always works fast enough get moderate severe disease Portions manufactured Denmark multiple goals one time. immediate goal obviously alleviate pressure hospitals. vaccine going effective SA variant future variants inevitably arise result selection pressure escape vaccine. Also people develop immunity adenovirus vector, reduce efficacy boosters. 

So yes need eradicate disease long run else we're going pandemics. similar Ireland NZ also loud, obnoxious neighbour neighbour interesting data findings studies possible herd immunity approached Israel? Given already immunized one-third population at-least one dose currently per 100 people per day, seeing hospitalizations/deaths start fall sharply soon. New zealand western? Norway Finland failed contrast Taiwan New Zealand.

And Belgium, Italy, Slovenia, UK, Czechia failed contrast Sweden.

By cherry-picking countries chose compare paint Sweden either grandma killing factory country that, despite lax restrictions, way better many countries heavy restrictions.

Isn't embarrassing USA, despite horrible leadership, actually better many EU countries? Yes wish would say this. 62% outcomes nearly 100% preventing hospitalizations. think people worried going hospital running fever couple days. saying might better spend less time favelas maybe keeping distance beach? course take care shopping food such. 


\[Cue helicopter\] Hah!  substance manufacturing XXX (FR/BE), XXX(I/IL), **XXX(UK), XXX(UK)**, XXX(ITL) /dad jokes/ think technically 27 million number includes second doses, think really like 24 million individuals least one shot. 

Even so, adding number (though overlap exists) people already immune due contracting Covid, results big number giddy plus growing every day! 100 million doses end June great, REALLY want know many doses end of, say, April. even talking this? lazy figure get plural billions accurate sounds impressive millions. I'd think manufacturing problem, I'd keep separate supply chain. Unless we're talking supply chain parts materials needed vaccine plant itself. case may go back big bang. /s Portions produced US agree. stop hand wringing approve Astra Zeneca. They've using UK months.

Still business usual DC. FDA. ""we hold rigorous standard"" fuck that. People dying. Children home boiling hidden anxiety stress. Mental health issues last YEARS.

Johnson Johnson data. Oh they'll FDA next Friday. want bother anyone's weekend plans. reckon end February we'll probably see hospitlisations/deaths fall sharply given enough time vaccinated build immunity assuming they've vaccinated majority elderly/vulnerable now. They'll probably reach herd immunity April I'm pushing back assertion primary goal vaccine prevent death.

And wrong. Yea, mostly since study transmissions directly, can't make claim 100% know open doubt litigation. belief offer least major form infection limitation logical deduction. However, virus shown defy lot existing logic best keep people hospital first, worry R0 later. Yeah, I've shave regularly last year, dammit. Hahahaha! We're going fewer deaths faster!..... everyone already dead! 

Can't die dead! Yes fact cases started rise November lockdown lifted. lockdown cases went down, after, increased. obvious going happen.

The government even warned. Labour, opposition, said doubts tiered system effective, stand way concrete steps absence would worse. want side Tory rebels opposing measures even though could defeated government vote.

Mixing xmas risky cases hand. gov insisted xmas would go ahead planning discussing long time. could mitigated risk better. Think 100% severe AZ, remember exactly. still distance leaning alternative. Parents won’t forced put kids back classroom family members high risk category. Actually, yeah, am. made account cause frequent /r/accounting got license guess I'm undercover. worker tested positive arrived Japan.

Rather get something effective moderna Pfizer I'm 2 dose trial got first shot couple weeks ago. due second March. say anything reducing transmission? nothing reduce transmission, help herd immunity, would it? ""You almost certain long lot virus circulating community, evolution mutants, viruses do,"" vaccine got worst results vaccines far yet praised all. 

I think anyone praising Moderna Pfizer, fact 1 dose significant logistics standpoint.

The vaccines there, quicker end calamity. Based current variants current distribution vaccines available, don’t think pandemic year. Yes, people already resumed pre covid life, SA variant already US. time SA variant takes hold US, maybe fall. vaccine variant ready then? general public get first shots wait “vulnerable people get sa variant shots and/or second round shots due expired immunity first round shots?

I would understand people would want return normal coin flip chance best protect covid variant going fly. honestly believed hype mRNA vaccines, elicit broad immune response forms covid. Apparently unfortunately enough. mean were, additional shots would made even “abundance caution”. lot people surprised Christmas still expected wear masks social distancing due sa another variant. can't imagine kind luxury.

And, unlike Pfizer Moderna vaccines, stored freezers. stored three months refrigerator temperatures 36 degrees 46 degrees schools already open. I'm sure getting 66% effective would help peace mind all.

85% severe case, 100% death... give shit ASAP. calculate healthy old, pretty damn low probability ""severe case"" anyway... cut factor 10. I'd one hell peace mind. agree, crappy headline...delay, cut. I'm escaping killer virus hop car find first. I'm driving Civic see Lexus side road swap cars.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Jesus america, guys really know pandemic don’t ya  Flu vaccines around 45%ish percent efficacy. 66% efficacy one shot enough put serious dent pandemic think.

Overachievers Pfizer Moderna really set bar high expectations. literally claimed presented multiple sources actually linked one.

I thought posted one source, end world. Even way phrased hardly egregious. source directly contradicted you.

It did, I'm happy admit everything say self-serving lie point. pretend rude point obvious lies busy clinging delusion spreading misinformation.

First all, even lies? stated Oxford ran trial UK (which did), MHRA encouraged AZ carry LD/SD regiment (which did). Somehow stating things ""putting spin""? joke.

I clearly incorrect calling dosing accident.

Also, ""lies"" like put it, hardly self serving, get anything it! 

I'm sorry quite funny intense this. still botched trial, otherwise MHRA asked continue accepted results.

Also, Edit 2: Correction error part - informed (correctly) SII producing Covid doses months now. However, doses kept use India use next months.

India [gifting doses countries ;) Huh? wouldn't, Company B guarantee delivery numbers. contact company causing failure one fulfilled, ever estimated delivery schedule (which EU blacked out), commitment best efforts.

Company C (the EU case) upset wants faster delivery even damages parties. company B (AZ) reduce delivery UK would (possibly) breach contract, way around. breach contact EU nothing contact unfulfilled. Let's see get choice! know UK, people choice Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, even though AstraZeneca lower efficacy.

Also, damn shame they're vaccinating immunocompromized yet, really hope get soon! applies 5.4 apply initial doses included 5.1.

All 5.4 means UK need provide EU written notice get vaccines EU sites mean need even since 5.1 include UK.   Delivery Q3 😑 known years important masks are.

This virus hasn’t existed years. existing data last flu pandemic suggested mask wearing general public didn’t help slow spread. couple notes. Variation efficacy regions. 72% US, 66% LATAM, 57% South Africa. interim analysis saying work well variants. 

Still awesome news, even 80%+ efficacy people wanted. Hopefully gets EUA soon get much closer ending this! &amp; Johnson said Friday single-dose Covid-19 vaccine reduced rates moderate severe disease, shot appeared less effective South Africa, new coronavirus variant become vaccine 66% effective preventing moderate severe disease 28 days vaccination. efficacy differed depending geography. shot 72% effective among clinical trial volunteers U.S, 66% among Latin America, 57% among South Africa. Though markedly levels seen first two authorized Covid-19 vaccines, rates thresholds originally set U.S. Food Drug Administration vaccine considered vaccine reduced severe disease alone 85%, prevented Covid-related hospitalization death, Johnson &amp; Johnson pandemic, can, single-dose vaccine, quickly eliminate severe consequences death, hospitalization, severe disease, that’s what’s important society,” Paul Stoffels, company’s chief scientific officer, told STAT.

...

Article continues ABC News going crazy South Africa variant morning. government seriously considering locking borders South Carolina martial law? would overreaction? guess go double dose regimen similar AstraZeneca considering technology completely incorrect. reputable news source reported this. efficacy original strain comparable Pfizer Moderna’s vaccines. J&amp;J vaccine 57% effective South Africa variant 

Looks like mRNA best route here. Hopefully Pfizer Moderna booster shots work wife concerned shes damnear allergic everything available allergic to... mother same, carry Epi pen. That's Novavax 2 shots. not? would save lives. Well, that's bad, definitely ideal either. I'm sticking current ones immunocompromised person Life basically normal here, except can't go skiing French Alps year 😭 won't. States even suggesting point.

When hospitals full keeping people gathering going vacation going happen, many it. videos show reality ground. data faked videos cannot faked.

I live take bus go out, life sweden totally normal streets. Nobody wearing masks take bus count maybe two people masks.

You one misleading everybody.

Everything sweden giving recommendations, people caring about.

The UK, Spain, France, Italy, US. ones taking hit restrictions forced masks. sweden life carries virus real.

Another one train station. Nobody masks swedes deceptive?. TL;DR- exactly u/a_fleeting_being said. 

Well, gov't  *supposed*  supply vaccines Palestinian National Authority, recent news sources claimed gov't provided 200 shots PSE medical staff, provide 1000 more, though obviously enough. Previous reports suggested PSE purchased 2 million Sputnik 5 vaccines Russia units donated Russia WHO. Anyway, now, they've got nothing. 

Regarding West Bank:  
No official vaccines policy. I've read, vaccinate people settlers -\_-

I understand though supply vaccines Gaza, bc Hamas entity controls Gaza Strip (tyrannically imo), might use vaccines somehow badly (selling citizens countries example). Currently, main reason vaccines provided due Israeli gov't demanding return two slain soldiers. I'm sure what's going getting political. 

And since Israeli Arabs citizens Israel, get vaccines like citizen. 

I'd like clarify fond current government, yet think Hamas vicious organization. encourage google information rely me. (It's nice arranged vaccinations though).  vaccine game changer: one dose refrigerating temperature. EU go nuclear declare vaccines Public Goods making patents associated IP free open license. step, many companies could contribute production and/or speed development competing vaccines.

The developing world behind EU S. Africa, India countries expressed similar immune response trails similar 65. Therefore every reason believe effective 65 65. 

It's much easier work produced large numbers. 

It great Germany want wait, others. is, course, entirely unconnected producing considerably expensive vaccine, sold profit. public policy want use virus handful isolated cases around country completely different public policy one widespread community transmission. shit recommendations changed went one other. Yep, seems likely proportionate response. UK manufacturing AZ, Novasep, GSK Valneva vaccines.

UK: going export ready made vaccines whole population vaccinated

EU: alright same, cause dont like syphon ready made vaccines share all

UK: omg that’s sick! wont even supply mats.

Feels wierd UK. Wish people would understand this. Even cases really mild/asymptomatic, seen damage body.  

I hold pfizer/moderna unless something goes crazy wrong roll (which claim target still) Fine comparison rest Europe, bad comparison rest world. (the US) project much vaccine summer (probably way actually use), I'm wondering Biden administration considering sending vaccine allied countries summer rolls around becomes widely available within US.

We're going want eventually, since ending pandemic require mass ***global*** vaccination, we're extremely behind on. ""no lockdowns"" means party again. love causality chain!! Assuming qualify now, probably waiting long regardless. know best best qualifying June/July I'm supper worried it. I'm even hopeful qualify then. hope got vaccine I'm happy help either way.  point works single dose could nearly double speed progress point everyone vulnerable vaccinated one worry getting someone killed infecting them. Getting vaccinated really getting individual back normal shot, applied whole population makes virus longer serious threat. person's interest get vaccinated contributes reaching state faster, means everyone return normal faster. Umm, I'm truly fishing thanks. come from, heard lot given advice growing up. There's also many times adult life I've recognized may learned something old connect person moment give thanks experience. good news, definitely varies location. would think it'll pick across board regardless. Early adoption probably hardest something brand new. *have* supply, simply choosing deliver per contract, redirecting elsewhere.

That probably bode well future whatever sell EU. Even gets approved can’t see people lining get J&amp;J one. 2 vastly superior vaccines already market.

Sorry got heated made point less clear. course certain going months perfectly safe. may while. rather point bound get better overtime factor hope hopefully help people cope mental health problems. overlooking security measures right absolutely option, make literally everything worse; keep infection numbers going up, turns causes stress strain everything everyone. 

I mean downplay importance mental health matters either, absolutely feel destroyed well. reckless actually counterproductive regard, also value mother’s life mental well being.

I imagine people don’t high risk people immediate family might feel level concern (not saying thats case). picture person love dying covid someone behind grocery store valued going drink friends gambling people’s lives.

I sincerely wish best hope find ways get better without putting others danger. may things help us cope meantime.

If help way, feel free reach out. Well, see wit J&amp;J vaccine too. I'd expect similar variances. already know lab testing vaccines much less effective strain. People will, fact, go summer vacation. Especially vaccinated.   Yes, Pfizer get mean, hope understand meant say. Ya assume booster vaccine soon missing point like guy.

Everyone worldwide prioritising 65s, highest risk death around factor 10. limited production capacity thus supply.

EU specifically said first come first served that's 'fair'.

They giving AZ risk, means logically *fairly* go country's are. 

EU 65s important non EUs elderly, especially massive difference risk (UK example, 93% deaths 60s, despite 16% case rates. Hell 1000 100,000 dead 45, 1%) Asia/Middle East Grandma passes grandkids, pushed back in-person school (if already school time), grandkids asymptomatically pass teacher daycare worker - vaccine rollout ramped yet - still gotten shots yet, someone lives underlying conditions bad luck dies it. going take several weeks get vaccine rolled everyone. Grandma chill bit see grandkids. AKA suck up, miserable keep sitting like goody goody. lbr many going meekly watch tv second straight summer. want prioritize teachers, also fine, let stay home.

We extend protection fast food worker who's crammed tiny kitchen hours minimum wage, teachers make better protected less risky environment, get special treatment? may fair compared like computer programmer, let whoever want stay home continue collecting paycheck, society would grind halt. live unprecedented times tough decisions made, comparing low risk young healthy teacher high risk students falling behind, clear decision made.  Blah blah fuckin blah US approved it, guarantee hope too, EU already regular shipments resumed Pfizer Canada getting 75%-100% smaller shipments mid-february, federal government reducing 4m dose objective March 31st 3.5m, seems pretty bleak us :\ . Fingers crossed guess. totally unexpected turn events, EU late too! 'Western' super messy term. avoid days.

I mostly see used mean 'Europe + North America' really, really needs better term. Yeah even beyond bad PR would impossible actually implement. would quickly get ""mid-century race science"" territory. basically prevent heart damage/other long COVID effects well? research well one dose Pfizer/Moderna protect serious illness? 

Not protecting contracting COVID general, odds someone hospitalized dying. I'm assuming since body already built defenses first dose, better job fighting virus would otherwise? personally took umbridge ""not game changer"", signs point literally game changer. vaccine, we'll able get back normal much quicker would otherwise. going vaccinate teachers, none rest stuff matter. trying get get teachers back classrooms vaccinated reasonable. Kids need back school soon possible. Educating kids important preventing covid much longer much greater impact people covid will.   JnJ committed 100 million doses June 30. Let’s say start feb 28th they’re wrong august 31 get allotment. Whew nelly. That’s still 500k extra people day 3.5 million week. Complete game changer. Minimum. Biden got elected. could 8. I’m wondering well. tell results whether studied? relying fact assessed numerous clinical trials approved bunch countries including super wealthy countries like UAE, Bahrain Singapore. left behind EU. failing see controversy here. exactly says. That’s EU pushing publishing contract. AstraZeneca messed again. oh freaking better be!!!! Interesting stuff. I’m hopeful get vaccines arms. comparison J&amp;J, Pfizer Moderna data? 66% compare others rolled out? Oxford allowed AZ produce vaccine stipulation would sold zero profit. price UK higher, manufacturing costs also higher. However, specific requirement Oxford Universities contract AZ zero profit made pandemic over. Maybe them, way things going Biden making ""on way herd immunity"" Summer statement, think least US things many ways ""normal"" holiday time. Even initial virus variant made worth using better mask against. I'd recommend KF94. Yeah, variants seem like properties could make problem. 

So I'd say strategy is: wear KF94, KN95, N95 situations possible exposure, particularly common public setting, get vaccine earliest possible opportunity. 

Vaccines end game. believe evolution real, know creationists indifferent life. believe means vaccine working body creating antibodies. could way wrong someone please correct case point future everyone 1x2 dose mRNA vaccine 1x1 dose adenovirus vaccine completely eradicate Coronavirus. conflict/redundant two? Useless absolutely bizarre Canada supplied European plants American ones. logistics standpoint make sense all. believe choice I'm sorry experience pandemic. Given fact chronic illnesses, prospect better vaccine. think worded first statement, comes bit anti-vaxx J&amp;J vaccine create quite positive impact. I'll answer best understanding.

If J&amp;J get sick, pass virus on. point vaccine generally available, increasingly unlikely get sick transmit people. Plus, get sick likely stay home.

In addition, much like true asymptomatic (not pre-symptomatic) spread significantly less significant, mild symptomatic spread also less significant vector spread.

Finally, we're still learning long-term effects COVID, research suggests mild symptoms plus dramatic long-term effects rare outcome. urgency see locations across US 24 hours day.   Take shot!!!!! study, definition severe COVID-19 disease included laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 one following: signs consistent severe systemic illness, admission intensive care unit, respiratory failure, shock, organ failure death, among factors. Moderate COVID-19 disease defined laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 one following: evidence pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis, shortness breath abnormal blood oxygen saturation 93%, abnormal respiratory rate (≥20); two systemic symptoms suggestive COVID-19. think swine flu back 2008 big deal. infected millions millions people still around today, severe. person question used CDC authority matter. I'm citing source back him. sh!t, sherlock. — without assessed country’s medicines regulator. US covid vaccine export ban? ""And deaths"" long stay harsh restrictions vaccinations stop death hospitalisations? point need lives back. far I'm aware clinical trial data showing efficacy mRNA vaccines SA variant, best lab data. make 100 million doses quickly. see insane dude. Sounds good!  already ongoing trial two shots. started last fall. One group already second shot, last group get second shot get March, study scheduled finished November. 

I don’t know preliminary data available, wait study ends know results. CNN pretty reasonable variants vaccines tbh. Johnson Johnson rolling review since 1 December, come first. approval AZ frees valuable man power assessment J&amp;J vaccine apply EMA. can't give specific advice, go r/COVID19, weekly question thread, people know talking impossible stop anti science movement foundation religious noone balls take religion. Keep posting this. 

This closer ending people think tech different can’t swap one other.

It would take long get enough mRNA vaccine everyone world. tried that, you’d still rampant pandemic 3rd world 5+ years ... cases, likely get mutation seriously impacts effectiveness best vaccines.

So it’s smarter use everything now, even it’s perfect. Maybe think twice making everyone immortal? happening California also. 100% agree you. mention preventing long haul symptoms important younger people long healthy lives ahead them. Sorry controversial true. J&amp;J vax 100% effective preventing death, nearly preventing hospitalization. exactly wanted older folks. makes think it’s going 4 years? Maybe living small town village see Göteborg Stockholm Good point. quote [the J&amp;J press vaccine candidate 85 percent effective preventing severe disease across regions studied, [i] 28 days vaccination adults 18 years older. Efficacy severe disease increased time cases vaccinated participants reported day Janssen COVID-19 vaccine candidate demonstrated complete protection COVID-related hospitalization death, 28 days post-vaccination. clear effect vaccine COVID-19 cases requiring medical intervention (hospitalization, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)), reported cases among participants received Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, 28 days post-vaccination.

This sounds good better Pfizer Moderna vaccines. reasonable leave countries ""manufacturing countries"" simply without vaccines then? **Bot dumb?** 

&amp;#x200B;

My favorite reddit game, bet bot. perfect excellent enemy good. 70% effective 100% efficacy hospitalization variants large trial, *for single dose* brilliant game changer promising anymore right??? erm .. wouldn’t sure literally explained context was. think numbers speak willfully ignorant. friend named ""Alan"" says wrong dad could beat dad. Thanks- number seems feasible/reasonable me. pretty straightforward process. definitely something concerned about. else equal, I'd rather get COVID all. expect vaccines offer protection side effects. impossible, would surprising vaccines protect short term symptoms long term ones.

Unfortunately, likely years good handle important long-term symptoms really are, vaccines affect them. part reason vaccines half puzzle: half reducing case rates. Vaccination greatly reduce risk you, case rates high, there's still non-trivial lingering risk. Side note: 0 data reduction efficacy vaccine, neutralizing effect convalescent plasma, even rough mortality rate estimate Manaus/P.1 strain. getting point worrisome. must hundreds thousands cases (mostly Manaus) P.1 now. :( Sorry hear that. state looked pretty bad gate picked around top 3rd so. Granted though family California sounds like major logistical nightmare right now, fiancee \~30s basically long haul. 

Glad got good hear grandparents least getting next week. Almost them!  Don’t fast. J&amp;J pointed out, difference vaccine effectiveness may due trials took place variants virus tested against. words, J&amp;J performed stage 3 trial back June 2020 Moderna November, could see diametrically different results would sing praise ‘traditional’ vaccines.  There's false equivalence circulating around eradication disease = eternal lockdowns. That's wrong way think it. eradicated diseases highly efficacious vaccines without lockdowns. 

The ""harsh"" restrictions need remain place vulnerable vaccinated. there, restrictions eased slowly reach herd immunity vaccination. let rip COVID still circulating high levels, create selective pressure virus evade vaccine. 

Since already variants partially evade vaccines, we're going keep making boosters future. point going difficult make boosters J&amp;J vaccine people develop antibodies adenovirus therefore reduce efficacy even more. people uk die guys catch look bad? Child abuse Looks good. assume we'll start HS age I'm right you. fiancee travel banned consulates refuse process visas exempt. Already one year now. much eastern nations. 

Australia New Zealand closer culturally UK US is. almost every vaccine effective? EU *is* blocking exports pending export authorizations granted unless EU gets vaccines want, shortages notwithstanding. *might be*? transparency wouldn’t this. means doses belong countries *will be* diverted toward EU, countries’ citizens *will* die favour European lives. Certain festivals, concerts, events, etc. Life comes fast. Next time you’re able go one events look around try figure average age people there. reason younger side. Sure may enforced maximum age limit, hit certain age you’ll find experience changed. Brazil campeao mundo kkkkkkkkkkkk J&amp;J trial done? Unless South Africa Manaus ~no data efficacy B.1.351 P.1. Nobody know covid long term lasting damage. know happens know could easily point lot survivors anecdotally long term problems. said, statistically it’s something concern stage. We’ve year. get better it. vein thrombosis

I'm doctor, make sense. DVT leads admittance hospital 50% time according NHS study unless midst statistical anomaly, occurrence DVT must damn near close 1 2 cases max, case enough evidence decide DVT risk lowered remains post inoculation. mean yeah? common sense articles weird Aha. Gotcha. good point. It’s helping matters, that’s sure. Fine, care opinion China Russia countries employing vaccines. certain age risk go ahead

If I'm understanding right, longer opposed Hungary approving vaccines? difference UK US said export vaccines start, whereas EU explicitly said would export vaccines, many countries made deals companies vaccines produced inside EU. *not* go EU. UK sovereign entity simply made contract. would hold contract made German French government, btw. Huh? I'm suggesting young people given vaccine versus wait three four months.

My idea would prevent lot severe moderate symptoms people. 2% hospitalizations fall vaccinated group really good. lot done. I’m surprised headline wasn’t “Israel vaccine program potentially failure” aware history black community medical community. nothing autism lie, horrific past transgressions. Fauci quite busy :) think mean ""severe infection"" sent home recover O2 tank monitor :/ couple epidemiologist vacinologists (if that's proper term) wrote really interesting op-ed NYT basically argued booster generally major driver increased efficacy point sacrificing people recieve initial dose ASAP even lapse timeline 2nd shot. 

They used tons examples vacines general knowledge field make pretty compelling case. bottom line - 

Most vaccines reach close potential efficacy 1 dose (body takes \~2 weeks hit point). 

During trials company needs standardize data pick lag time second (or 3rd, 4th, Nth dose, depending type) sake generating data point. Due tight timelines run tests Moderna/Pfizer chose agressive lag times second dose - likely hard scientific justification times (vs. say 8 weeks, 4 months, etc.). authors notes basically cases second doses required somewhere 2 - 6 months later, implying lkely hard imune response justification current 3/4 week targets expediency. 

Vaccines tend wane efficacy, generally order 6 months potentially years first dose. 

Many vaccines released company guidelines administration following used trial approved company continue broader studies / administration timelines population time laxen derective - authors notes past multiple examples vaccination / booster sets originally required 3-4 shots eventually taken 2-3, example. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, ultimate conclusion much critical cover many people 1 shot least hit people much likely severe reactions worse exposure rates. let fear people ending second dose potentially even month later major stumbling block slows us - likely 1st dose perform close 2 dose regimen least months covering populations save lives short term. 

I thought interesting information given already seeing pretty substantial lessening cases US even though even \~2% population 1 dose like 2 weeks back. think also gives hope mRNA vaccines may potent previous technology (or maybe J&amp;J one need boosters - I'd think scientists designed would factored trial get go release effective final product could. 

&amp;#x200B;

Link (probably pay-walled) -  Virtual high five correct something reddit! would interesting look well one shot mRNA vaccines work. data indicates protection might 90’s% also (after 2-3 wk. ramp immune system). tested two shot get go. also don’t know long 1 vs 2 shot immunity lasts. 

I think there’s reasonable chance learn mRNA vaccines dosages lowered (fewer side effects) possibly delivered one shot loss efficacy. Wha-what? pro virus comments stunning listening conversation done. Well hopefully virus evolution decreases ability fuck us hard. yeah years least we’ll sticking boosters. businessinsider.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

It would like spinning wheel get Mayo Clinic get clinic. However wait eventually get Mayo Clinic. 1 shot, don’t die.

The ""bronze Widowmaker"" vaccines. dont understand think UK? company living contracts, everybody knows prediktioner hard compressed timescale, telling 2-3 weeks ahead delivery exporting factories best effort contract... that’s problem. solved keep everybody happy - no. winners this. Think one learning next pandemic selflessness, future EU plainly invoke export without permission onset. Sad play fair supply selfless asshats. Kejri play lot victim game like zero efforts state government. Credits due home minister sir rallies around latest 40 days back. job home minister something pity Long term effects play part restrictions, keep real Thanks. helpful. looks bad face value, makes sense long run. logistics rollout vaccine set specific way. vaccination sites start differ guidelines, could throw wrench whole process. Getting people actually willing vaccinate worth sacrificing doses. 

We lose vaccine hesitancy stays high among black population. medical community trust re-earn that? doctor even blink eye O2 sats 90-95%. medical sources I've seen count O2 low 90%, say 95%. Read section titles Gotta love ""Hurr Duur Americans suck"" circle jerk. time approved distributed, would hope folks get Pfizer Moderna. civil. plenty news articles mean common. We've many people infected covid. mean US alone 26m official cases although probably double consider many cases missed back March. say 50m cases include missed US. many suffered long term issues need go hospital?   Yup sadly results summer would make much sense prominent warnings Pinellas County, FL Jackson County, MO (and surrounding counties them) LA since majority fans live either team ones tempted gather (likely without masks), would expect biggest spikes there. contradicted bringing quote up. 

If claim true, message would've something like, ""two weeks eliminate virus."" strategy isn’t working, cases dropping?  Rural America, yes. Rural Mexico, Brazil, Middle East, Africa, much. people speak louder masks on. to. skill learn infectious diseases labs pretty quickly. realize everybody across entire country going parties, multiple contagious variants circulating now? guess f-it point right? God forbid don’t Super Bowl pandemic. 

Nobody care virus starts putting younger people hospital. hold SA variant? basically Sweden weird kid says ""my study method superior"" perform badly exam Belgium, Italy, Slovenia, UK, Czechia kids followed study method actually worse?

Why focus weird kid based end results? focus 5 kids actually performed worst class?

Okay then... Lol Nigel Farage literally sat EU parliament express purpose sabotaging it.

The idea French CEO stop British company using anti-EU pro-Brexit troll farms literally proving Brexiteers cannot fathom world nationality mean much. CA ALREADY vaccinating 65+. That's issue. issue article discusses CA plans still prioritize age versus comorbidities 65 population. Basically, CA vaccinate people 50s next even they're healthy, people COPD, diabetes, etc.? completely irrational. bought mine online Costco last week. they’re showing 75% range June-August 2021. 

They said won’t absolutely 0 cases probably 2022 think everyone understands. would take one, especially someone reduced risk profile. swimming mRNA vaccines, yeah I'd prefer one those, manufacturing full scale take time, using end pandemic sooner.

In future, mRNA technology used make annual flu vaccine, already infrastructure make billions doses year, able switch making vaccines next pandemic pretty quickly. hALf eFFeCtiVe /s lol people unrealistic expectations Palestinians? 21 year old grandson lol, he’s cousin, agreed. 

It’s perfect shot may getting vaccinated fear health, they’re either required want see family can’t currently see (where family members get Moderna)  Data one still months away believe.

I'm trial received second jab last week. believe still administering first jabs couple weeks ago too, full cohort even received doses mid-March earliest. 66% effective. Ugggghhh. game changer. good news. Avoid topic political comments. understanding transition period mostly trade, movement people,goods logistics. think UK wasnt part EU institutions. looks like similar Oxford one then. single shot though that's better. Hopefully prevented serious illness cases Flu vaccines even reach 70% great news.  mean US data inconsistent South African data? Different efficacy different countries mean data mess. sure true.

However, late summer early fall, everyone going drop precautions go back normal. would prefer wait fully protected then, rather get vaccinated earlier spring less protected later...

The trade whether rather 60% protected April/May vs 95% protected August. I'll take second option day... post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

85% didnt severe COVID. 15%?

And say, 100% effective hospitalization. remaining 15%? Avoid topic political comments. Well case EU would well within right BioNtech vaccines. AZ vaccins produced UK immediately mean property UK, way EU BioNTech vaccines. 

Now contract published far understood still unclear whether AZ promised uk produced doses not. didn't, obviously welcome keep yourselves. AZ screwed EU UK both. sweden life carries virus real.

Or offered vaccines first place, towns

Yeah. write end pandemic good, mean reducing annual flu terms society affected. way completely eradicate it.

The experts keep saying best way end pandemic get vaccinated keep virus mutating. don’t want point easily concluded advice vaccines don’t prevent infection, scarier dangerous covid variant could form normal life resumed. look number variants advanced dangerous way original China strain emerged despite strict government restrictions. SA variant managed reduce efficacy thought groundbreaking mRNA vaccines based preliminary data. experts declare efficacy rates refer sterilizing immunity put reputation line. “think” “maybe” etc. 'Demonstrated Complete Protection COVID-19 related Hospitalization Death Day 28' 

This good news, duped misleading headlines. flight booked two weeks second dose appointment next month. haggled price vaccine provided cost price. know cost means?

You get pay for. UK US paid vastly ensure supply chain place. Reap sow. people seem overestimate long keep restrictions. honestly think even true, would point (soon) people would give waiting vaccine go lives anyway. lawyer looks like way reading it.

Sorry, way...  mean good enough, oof. Unless bandana pressing edges mask, bandana provide much protection good enough especially single shot solution. let rip! percentage vaccine? I'd avoid AZ, super sketchy tons people believe reason pandemic people wearing masks enough

I mean pretty much true. There’s articles online could get pandemic control 3 months everyone wore mask. back September October.

I think you’re really underestimating many people ignoring mask rules bad that’s really making pandemic worse.

Also I’ve saying since like August really recommend mask wearing home.

Community spread happening mostly household. small percentage people catching go out. bring back home everyone living catches it. many spreaders. time one goes out, give average least 1 person.

If encouraged mask wearing home times, sleeping separate room, etc could begin taking control Link(s)? obligation produce contracted amount doses Q1 supersedes preference produce within EU UK bans ingredients required Pfizer vaccine fair?

Amazing defending EU signed flimsy agreement far behind countries. Many literally hoping close 90% effectiveness sub least expected reach 70%. 

And provided 85% protection hospitalisations, meanwhile even Oxford vaccine scored ~100% metric. Wait ... EU theoretically demand Pfizer give vaccines produced US make lack proper planning? That's outrageous. vaccines. every American vaccinated we'll happy help vaccines US government issued contracts vaccinate Americans. Also, testing 2-dose regime. booster might increase it. United States released statistic Facebook would run ""Vaccines work"" posts 100% effective hospitalizations, quite similar Oxford. think there's often differences what's considered 'severe COVID'.

Also worth considering J&amp;J really strict, stringent primary endpoints criteria trials. hope so. Ontario seems like people willing put perpetuity. it’s media public health officials anybody age 75 won’t see another human die people shrug say it’s best mean 15% got severely ill. means 85% expected severe illnesses prevented. pretty good. would cutting hospital ICU admissions aren’t scared covid like people subreddit.

You completely misunderstood mindset people taking Covid seriously. don’t need personally afraid safety see damage outbreak community. It’s flat stupid selfish part getting virus control put behind us. I’m privy medical history may eligible due risk factor. favor cutting much beard comfortable time. 

There multiple studies, articles, sources pointing fact shaving *not* necessary all. wear well fitting mask. masks large faces/beards cover quite well. Double mask afraid. EU would literally let elderly brits die vaccinate young. 

Not true. EU pushing equal vaccine distribution. Right UK 4 times vaccinated people Germany. argue UK literally let young EU's front line workers get infected means workers cannot hospitals save elderly. “Most left lifetime disabilities”

The survival rate 99%, long term complications. vaccines work. Look trial. Clause 5.4 includes uk purposes 5.4.

Clause 5.1 states initial doses (i.e. initial 300m dose order) manufactured EU. 5.4 applies includes UK EU purposes clause 5.1 initial doses contractually obligated delivered EU manufacturing facilities. least that's reading it. really something formal arbitrators courts need weigh on.

&amp;#x200B;

The real takeaway I've got anyone trying claim kind clear-cut case either actually understanding contract properly outright lying. certainly nota good look either side kind ambiguity could get contract. require AZ produce Initial Europe Doses best effort basis EU plants section 5.1. UK part EU. 5.4 essentially said UK plants allowed produce EU without prior notification commission, regarding Best Effort 5.1 state ""EU"", think UK plants required assist fulfil Best Effort...

That contract really badly written, whoever fired. FIFO. Kroger taught something 16. 100% hospitalizations, though. means it’s going like flu go lives. Lols. Never going happen UK gets 100 million doses. assume UK already outside EU technically still EU signed ?

The uk legally outside eu start 2020. uk plants mentions members states aren't. dispute plants used. Az say, contracts (seems backed text) commission disagree. contract explicit, initial doses EU made EU, indeed get manufactured EMA approval (which still happened yet). later 'optional' 'additional' doses made EU + UK. lot people Reddit need lifestyle continue gratification.

They living sick sad shut lifestyle covid weird bizarre. covid happened lifestyle suddenly norm got social gratification thing already doing. 

Now, life close resuming they're scared shitless suddenly they're going bizzare outcasts again. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

All that’s tested symptomatic covid, infection transmission. 

This blasted across world. It’s shocking haven’t come across information. Peter Liese member European Parliament CDU, part European People’s Party (EPP) group, since 1994. EPP Coordinator Committee Environment, Public Health Food Safety substitute member committee budgets

not nobody!  People tend compare like countries. Deal it. disagree let's see compared Asia Australia New Zealand. Shit rabbit hole. feel like could major college still understand all. Thanks info. Hear! Hear! rejoicing one dose goes window. it’s Vaccine Friday people I'm go filming people using public transport show something. telling experience using metro Stockholm every even coffee shops, supermarkets restaurants.

Agreed, recommendations I'm suprised.

One question you, bit confused. time seem frustrated Sweden using face masks enough, post stuff like r/conspiracy Yesterday posted one sweden getting away masks normal life rest us forced wear masks.

Just wondering stance face masks. support used widely think kind oppression? Sure, Argentina even special,. Half people Argentina looks like northern Europe pale skin blonde/red hair. Thank detailed response, situation insanely confusing genuinely curious they’re sorting out. Hamas awful, agreed, real hinderance well people claim represent. Kind like Trump! Hey-ooooo. Thanks, again. even Oxford jab 100% effective metric? That's quite disappointing result. Give J&amp;J general public give mRNA shots elderly, vulnerable, essential workers. That’s get mild flu levels hurry.  I'm sorry, USA, Canada Europe keep hoarding every single fucking vaccine can't help export covid mutations guys. 

We vaccine 1% population, expect variations soon. Developing world ahead EU. India making distributing lots doses AZ vaccine.  FDA happy least 50% it, unless guidance also discusses importance ensuring sizes clinical trials large enough demonstrate safety effectiveness vaccine. conveys FDA would expect COVID-19 vaccine would prevent disease decrease severity least 50% people vaccinated.

[FDA UK left EU prior, past year 'transition period'. efficacy high people would hoped, also opens door unique vaccination strategies. Start jabbing young healthy people J&amp;J let older people less healthy people get Moderna Pfizer jabs. don’t even know works immunocompromised people. ""Doses"" ""Vaccine"" thing. They're precisely defined contract. 5.4 refers vaccine. dose prepared vial vaccine. world disappointing? think USA give EUA Novavax asap. Give low-risk individuals. Get herd immunity summer, avoid much spread SA variant, boost late summer.

&amp;#x200B;

It's hard, believe cannot done. *coughs hebrew*   disappointing result compared hoped though, question it. 

Looks like may partly due new variants though. fine. offer one young, healthy people aren’t likely hospitalized anyway. Best analogy I've seen EU like drunk guy McDonalds 2am complaining getting served everyone else ahead line, even though he's supersized meal also ordered McFlurry wonder many Palestinians got That's see it, too. 

UK media govt would well-advised prepare everyone AZ delivering EU UK plants. terrible messaging. watched actual video. person asked could safely travel Fauci’s answer basically “not now.” Okay, when? cases dropped certain level? certain percentage people vaccinated? didn’t even answer question. kind messaging depressing makes people feel like giving up. “it’s safe yet even you’re vaccinated community spread still high decreases certain level consider traveling again”? means take fucking vaccine. can't force you, going wait around baby you. go back normal, get covid that's you....should gotten vaccine. Pfizer ask vaccine brought room temperature administration, use within 2 hours. 

Here PDF administer vaccine: no. seatbelt car completely different. 

What wrong people. sad existence life would can't even see other's face! want see damn grandma's face without stupid piece cloth blocking half small frail face. want walk near someone mask think bubonic plague. want experience actual fucking laughter homie play game together. want see friend work see him/her actually smile. 

We definitely wear mask hell want wear one get sick future means. shit normalized through. live box. vast majority people absolutely unequivocally throwing masks burning things mandated anymore. 85 percent effective overall preventing severe disease. Masks taken private gatherings. social distancing enforced masks worn, really fault masks it? User error non-compliance blame.  seems comparable efficacy AZ. single shot seems like highly desirable vaccine. UK amount anti-vaxers US? 

No, one lowest vaccine hesitancy rates world. Recent polls 88% acceptance. Right, assuming there's hiccups mRNA production, US good place. J&amp;J still get ton use globally. cheaper, easier store single dose. EU currently massive battle secure less efficacious vaccine - they'll happily take every dose get. UK too, trying get first dose many possible.

Additionally, think people missing 72% efficacy figure US likely includes cases newer strains, can't actually compare early 95% Pfizer Moderna efficacy figures directly it. really confusing well.

Their [press says clear effect vaccine COVID-19 cases requiring medical intervention (**hospitalization**, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)), reported cases among participants received Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, **28 days post-vaccination**. 

So guess severe cases (which nearly definition would include hospitalization, said) occurred within 28 days receiving shot. Hopefully data packet submit FDA information needed see that's true. think already case Oxford vaccine? partnered AZ Europe North America US based company agreed manufacture vaccines cost.  satisfied turn gummy. remember getting vaccine 5 like this. idea for. Thank you, that's really valuable infographic! easier produce J&amp;J vaccine?  Hmmm...where read that? able read first two paragraphs paywall hit, here's quotd article.

""AstraZeneca told European Union would cut deliveries coronavirus vaccine 60 percent 31 million doses first quarter year due production problems, **according senior EU official.**""

Did AZ release statement saying delivered 60% less agreed missed it? EU?

I could missed news sources seen say came EU. mental gymastics, looking (now) public domain. don’t believe medical clinics offer option second dose. way governments (like NYC) want give 2nd doses away others first dose, would happy vaccine theoretically needs one dose. concern makes low efficacy vaccine defacto vaccine people offered.  Keep people hospitals. That’s point.  Yea uk supply 2 million per week going impact. take December 2022 get everyone eu vaccinated rate. guess UK would get vaccine funded manufactured start 2023? Sounds fair... least business good someone year Transient ischemic attacks,actually last three months. Still 50% threshold set vaccines developed. still good. vaccine breeding ground resistance. antibiotics. 1+1=2. What’s point? got Moderna, 10 days ago - everything fine 15-minute wait, 5 minutes drove away lips started tingle... swelling, trouble breathing - tingle. doubled back site EMT's check vitals stayed observance another 15-20 minutes. Felt completely fine whole thing, thought particular symptom weird. completely faded 90 minutes, experienced sore arm, day half so. reported VAERS. little nervous getting second shot, definitely ask longer observation period. allergies penicillin sensitivities certain products choose ""cleaner"" shampoos, makeup, etc., never severe anaphylactic reaction anything. Also - dermal fillers anything kind. anyone else kind mild reaction?? America leading way vaccines. people risk desease, whole idea medical/pharmaceutical science help people resarching medication/vaccination instead vaccinating everyone else? like flu vaccinations inoculate children they're risk.  tho? people compare Florida rest Southeast states entire country? Yes, is. people seem care. think approve J&amp;J Astrazeneca vaccines. already enough 95% effective vaccines everyone July. use less effective vaccines point? Goal posts moved. better number gauge ""excess morbidity"" i.e. deaths statistical norm. get initial vaccine first Moderna/Pfizer becomes widely available, consider booster. know would really help? washing hands wearing gloves touching public stuff like food grocery store.

I mean, even hard.. nothing eliminating anything. 

Yeah, still isn't, what's point? Lockdowns eased soon cases fall much like before. Honestly, looking recent results, MRNA vaccines insane, hope platform really takes this, maybe try MRNA Flu vaccine years. 6-9 months? second it’s warm outside people decide it’s time go back normal good enough though? reports people minor symptoms still suffering organ damage complications line? protect long covid long term symptoms though?

They can't. situation much demand 2021 covered company. essentially export ban. Otherwise, Canada would get shipments US. Instead, US ordered Pfizer got delivery date mid-year 200m additional makes lot sense since US government providing Pfizer necessary ingredients make vaccines US.

""5.1 Initial Europe Doses.

""

My read this

Clause 5.4 include UK EU manufacturing facilities, **only purposes clause 5.4**. clause 5.1, sets manufacturing initial 300m dose supply EU, AZ obligated manufacture using UK facilities since clause include UK facilities apply it.

The purpose 5.4 optional doses (an additional right order 100m doses) additional orders, saying AZ use EU UK facilities manufacture doses, also use non-EU facilities needed order.

Also bit 5.1 ""following EU market authorisation"" interesting, could used imply AZ's ""best reasonable efforts"" regarding manufacture supply actually apply EU authorize Vaccine. that's real stretch take.

&amp;#x200B;

I could wrong here, however something courts decide definitely clear cut either AZ EU would believe. Anyone trying state contract clear-cut either misinformed talking arse. love QR code idea, can’t imagine sheer outrage riots would cause US. Masks alone political. would gladly trade “freedom” 11 days local transmission.  Let get straight: think Swedes trying hide fact many people using face coverings?

I'm really confused point trying make, please explain. evidence becoming much clearer? face masks important?

I still get support universal mask mandates not?? That’s really good point. mostly come night Vaccine prevented hospitalization 85%. would love know number younger populations. even higher target one people 45 under. every vaccine great populations. Give vulnerable Moderna give young healthy one let’s go. need stop thinking covid death sentence ventilator waiting happen everybody. you’re senior you’re risk. you’re generally clear virus little problem. agree. Someone else said America successful rolling vaccine getting back normal Europe Reddit gonna implode. comments thread proved person right US ordered enough 95% effective vaccine everyone wants one July. J&amp;J vaccine limited production currently. point everyone vaccinated might account 20-40 million total people vaccinated. use 95% effective vaccines delay weeks. That's worth IMO considering new strains reduce effectiveness vaccines want start highest level possible. supposed ask questions like here. 

See downvoted comment days ago: thing took days since SA variant, considerable effect efficacy vaccines. Absolutely, awesome news. Makes sense. workplace like 1/10 wear masks properly. Many cover nose leave mask around chin. goes grocery stores anywhere else people legally required wear masks. Anywhere else see almost no-one wearing mask. Brilliant news! Let's take moment savour good news, amongst usual dirge. I’d say it’s disappointment. J&amp;J Friday news drop. know it’s Friday evening, it’s still Friday. Brilliant news! Let's take moment savour good news, amongst usual dirge. ""sort shit out"" informed last week two weeks ago low supplies Oxford vaccine? think two reasons people disappointed. 
First first two vaccines provided fantastic results. however proven lot issues logistics production. 

The people misunderstand numbers. 66% protection mean 34% change infected. means change infection drops 66%, around 3-4% American/European population confirmed infected far change massive begin with.

In end, see cheap beer. Yes, much prefer expensive one, one one available much prefer get drunk now. Good table results.. [Table results (via twitter) article 

If American public embraced masking along social distancing hand-washing, Redfield said “we could bring outbreak knees” within four eight weeks. Would smart idea accept people &lt;65, reccomend people &lt;65? got vaccine college student, would make covid multiple times less deadly average flu age... believe severe illness requires hospitalization. Illness handle home considered mild-moderate. I'm assuming US, restaurants take years turn profit, big corporate chains buy building outright normally unless small town. Paying rent prime locations profitable buying building part town less traffic getting way less customers. Plus, even buy it, would paying lease bank would still shut open. Brilliant news! Let's take moment savour good news, amongst usual dirge. UK amount anti-vaxers US? we're going herd immunity convince 60-70% get vaccine, 70% people actually gain immunity vaccine... probably reach herd immunity. Brilliant news! Let's take moment savour good news, amongst usual dirge. Fauci says no. say yes. whole point vaccine get lives back. disappointment immeasurable day ruined. Well Fauci *really* putting policies place? lot states merely suggestions enforce anything. support Fauci, though, think he's never going say ""it's small risk, go ahead."" Yeah, ommited non-western countries, right course. Let’s keep mind good flu vaccine 40-60% efficacy. J&amp;J vaccine win. don’t know people dooming it. high risk older population get mRNA vaccine low risk people get J&amp;J we’re golden. Omg Yes!!!

Can't go movie, sit restaurant (unless I'm grandma killer), see family sitting 6 feet away wearing mask (I'm sorry, like see fucking family folks), travel without thinking broke random border law. 

I'm fucking ready burn masks live alone worth living. FUCK COVID! Brilliant news! Let's take moment savour good news, amongst usual dirge. canceled subscription reason. got sick excessive editorializing. They've almost become tabloid point. fair, expectations based two already available vaccines. wouldn’t quite call unrealistic.  CNN) Johnson &amp; Johnson's Covid-19 single-shot vaccine shown 66% effective preventing moderate severe disease global Phase 3 trial, 85% efficacy severe disease, company announced vaccine 72% effective moderate severe disease US, company said. everyones interest see whole world vaccinated, try prevent mutations new variants.

Once Europe start reaching full vaccination maintain pace vaccine production send around world quickly possible. people understand huge. It’s way easier deploy help completely cut deaths summer. likelihood it’ll also reduce risk long term symptoms. Y’all got spoiled brand new tech used, still fantastic. Brilliant news!

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Rich famous priority group 0A ACIP recommendations. nobody rich famous got priority access something already demand, nobody would want it. people ACIP experts field made recommendations according thought would best public health made sure prioritize rich famous reason.  game changer

It game change least 3 ways:

a) One dose

b) Much easier storage requirements

c) 100% effective preventing hospitalizations, even get it, actually much lighter symptoms. think lot gloomy doomys changed realists longer drags on.

Almost apocalyptic predictions come pass really think overblown beginning. didn’t contradict myself. 15 days slow spread lockdowns associated policy. There’s nothing eliminating anything. Goal posts set thus moved. wasn’t time. continues day. would seriously doubt anyone's credentials saying that. 400 million doses Pfizer Moderna sitting storage could maybe buy argument enough supply several months. Good enough me. Stab me. contract states initial EU delivery come EU shall use Best Reasonable Efforts manufacture Initial Europe Doses within EU distribution reach herd immunity, Dr. Chirag Patel, UF Health Jacksonville, estimates least 70% population needs immune herd immunity is, people population develop immunity specific disease pathogen, case, virus significantly limit ability virus spread because, enough people community immune it, virus really place jump. can’t go person person,” Patel explained. “What seeing different estimates, conservative side think 70% population needs immunity achieve herd immunity. argued mutations occurring now, it’s going take 90% herd immunity happen.”  First export data, control. it’s control block. Call spade spade. EU block exports now. Yes I’m aware it’s meme. Yes I’m aware end hedge funds okay. it’s testament point, stock markets owning infallible entities like you’re saying 

You realize Reddit physicians, biologists (such myself) virologists, etc. saying somehow stock markets know peoples fields themselves, ridiculous 

Markets reactionary. I’m stock market expert I’m informed enough. Enough know markets don’t much digging actual interpretation study results

So suggestion would either:

A. Go make expert vaccines/biology, like many others, don’t site stock market basically medical evidence look foolish 

Or

B. Don’t comment matters know little nothing doesn’t really make much sense that’s kind why, FYI he’s wrong before. moment right there’s anything suggest he’s right Try going thru breakup pandemic haha fun times They’ve never part US vaccination plans.

The reason lot vaccine projections got delayed AZ supposed main vaccine. one US initially ordered thought would distributed September. truly miserable would hope vaccine would prevent type illness others.

Most likely would made case much less bad, someone else would otherwise die gets 2 week illness.

Which would registered 50% protection non-severe covid, even though benefited. necessarily. Look prioritized states. Healthy adults get bumped list children approved. No, argument bollocks. self claimed ‘lawyer’ known that. Exactly. I'm Pro EU. appalling EU. pointing fingers playing blame game hoping people forget messed up. would like know source info, please. I’m one people. don’t want part mass clinical trial. Especially I’m told can’t go back normal afterwards. 

I’ll take chances covid accept outcome get it. don’t want babied. want left alone. 

Internet tough guys like saying stuff like “get FUCKING vaccine“ trying shut dissent makes want take less. rethink approach. You’re hard think are. US UK keeping doses produce, one saying think. EU wants starts become problem. OP, seem know covid people do, asymptomatic mild cases still lung damage I'd rather get. One 'healthy 30 year old' friend mine gets winded going stairs hair loss/thinning even though relatively athletic, crazy me.

I got vaccinated. 95% effective good enough me. Still going wear N95's awhile, looking forward booking real vacation next 6-12 months. Thank image reading?!!! Novavax best efficacy far. don’t know. concerns variants, drop numbers hospital work huge. Don’t get wrong, it’s still high, buts almost half three-four weeks ago. lot death still though. Three simultaneous codes happened morning. code blue team emotionally physically exhausted. way find vaccine doctors office providing? concerned varying efficacy rates (I believe J&amp;J testing second dose, may show much higher effectiveness later). It’s partially prioritizing adults. death rates flipped we’d hard lock would fired trials even quicker. youtube video made 14 MDs! Lol I'm sorry say plan was. stop death hospitalisations. economy wait covid gone start not. people hurting can't work, losing jobs businesses. think well That’s guess CA got higher cases too. 70-80s dec-Jan. Basically beach weather. Everyone reason go out, Less inflammatory headline: ""EU US UK already doing."" January. Lol sorry IME = experience 🙂 Shots arms, protect hospitals, open fuck up.

No bullshit. 100% effectiveness death according headlines question regarding J&amp;J vaccine.

Was J&amp;J vaccine trial halted due serious side effects? 

Does anyone know outcome investigation? 

Thank you! think Moderna/Pfizer effective preventing moderate worse cases 2 doses, I'm completely sure read studies detail. places, likely exposed rates current infections higher ever before. late wear one. probably late coordinated effort make distribute them. UK supplies EU demanding. would produced physically removed UK. matter? Thousands upon thousands rapidly evolve, become extinct, mutate etc Congrats dismissing long term burden world’s hospitals populations. 

Quit making binary thing. would probably reverse sequence. would get AZ/Oxford mRNA? already 95% protection mRNA.

On hand might want get mRNA mutant booster get AZ/Oxford. mRNA companies already testing they're going come way quicker disabled virus ones. Thank you, much anxiety felt right thing her. feel guilty didnt realize trials would much later told summer fall medicine coming I've explained get medicine later us much safer. difficult navigate appreciate response much! understand short term supply problems, long run people going want excellent vaccines.

I’m already low risk death hospitalization, I’m serious getting virus. low efficacy vaccine practically guarantee I’ll get it. 

Before people start “do others”, “others” care healthy people too. don’t want long covid even don’t wind hospital. don’t want weird things happening us 10 years now. 

We want excellent vaccines too. 

These weak vaccines stop gaps, best. Don’t think focus 100% vaccinated people didn’t die weren’t hospitalized? Even SA variant. Children? know 80 yr olds still can’t get vaccine. mRNA vacs trialed SA variant conclusion invalid. per de start slinging timelines public, public funny way holding them. 

Example: reaction estimates 100MM doses available January didn’t get there?

Point supposed administration conservative they’re estimating. he’s shooting hip summer estimate absolutely fired least removed podium doesn’t understand basic public messaging. don’t think he’s obtuse though. certainty behind that.  **purpose** section 5.4, **Manufacturing Sites.**

Section 5.1 relates to... **manufacturing** Initial European Doses make sense said though course i'm expert 

Vaccine rollout picking up, work new variants, honestly he's maybe even trying stay relevant right Stopping hospital saturation always step one, never “the” step. 

Can y’all comprehend plans pandemic include multiple steps doesn’t mean goalposts moved? makes sense places numbers dropping like Florida especially Dakotas really anything different Here's hoping, Pfizer also pressuring us take extra doses vial, ""fulfill order"" without actually sending us more, syringes required. 100% this!

You guys discuss details hearts content forever always regular person it’s time GET SHOTS ARMS OPEN TF NOW! IME person?

Yeah think combination above. 27 million vaccines we've given US can't hurt though. 

I definitely think increased fear absolute last thing causing drop though. anything drop spite increased jadedness. Yes, Brazil run trial unless sinovac agreed Wow, vaccine magically keeps appearing loading dock manufacturing plant! one could expected this! /s qualified lawyer. You’re talking bollocks. Idk didn’t see coming, I’m way shocked flights offered canceled sooner better. I'm hoping get J&amp;J, AZ Novavax approvals fast possible end June. According British person forgets AZ signed contract EU governed UK law. UK law irrelevant. relevant EU contract that’s debateable.

This government government dispute masquerading commercial one. It’s everyone’s interest keep called commercial dispute it’s clearly not. know many people averse taking mRNA vaccine would take this. good news. australia western?

i mean, western country?

israel feels pretty western me... whatever means. sure would symptoms go hospital

Essential workers. Pfizer Moderna then.  really like hiding behind excuses don’t you. understanding trial run Butantan Institute, Sinovac. Hopefully publish full study soon. dad get second shot Pfizer utterly convinced continue stay home wear mask/social distance indefinitely variants. don’t know change mind otherwise. It’s saddening. someone who's nurse, general exception I'm say, Nurses fucking dumb bricks. Many epitome MLM, AntiVax, Homeopathic Medicine, Stars determine life idiots.

Nurses know chart, basic medical tasks. generally idea medicine care give actually works.

Now highly intelligent people science background, know live one, also works others. stories tells dumb nurses works genuinely piss off. locked August (she got new job around then), new coworkers kept inviting go drinking club. Half coworkers refusing vaccine (to point giving bonus it). many medical workers refused here, city drive vaccinations anyone wants one. Canada exempt order, won’t impact supply. let’s real here, EU’s one target UK. secondary tertiary problems government paying people stay home. possible, already likely enough vaccine whole country pretty soon. People also die push hard take shit. don’t ban food. argument invalid.  What's doomsday interpretation? almost countries invented access first.. would thought? /s is, true, perhaps best news I’ve heard year. 
I’ve long concern / kids could get vaccine. 
Information haven’t included hasn’t easy track down. 
I’d camp line get shot, I’d make “camping trip” kids them. 
Let’s hope pace picks last group important people gets included! Same. Kniwing vaccines still highly effective, I’m going panic. I’m going wait vaccine try watch 28 days later (again).  think might saving grace vaccine. immunity increase time goes cases 49 days. efficacy number might go one endpoints past 28 days. difference UK written contracts start. They're seizing anything produced others. EU lets companies set production there, knowing exported, half-way production seizes supplies meant others... somehow UK's fault? Lmao what? seen week the, EU different view meaning contracts manufacturer. Oh shut up. Get back who? speak Reddit now? fucking dick blame her. got appointment today wife go March. hour later brother called tell best friend died COVID yesterday. gotta gotta stay safe. perspective much different us, he's hospitals *a lot*. Deaths continue high level while, even cases decline. really. shorts high they've ever been. losses PAPER, they'll able hold longer redditors. end redditors lose everything.

It's cool meme all, reality tens thousands average Joe's lose everything. Black people US long history abused medical system hard blame them. pandemic always us.

Yeah, that's pandemics work, friend. Now, mean disease, that's likely. UK incredibly well vaccination programme right now, EU flails hopelessly tries block UK. AZ approved EU, expectations US approval? virtuous long grown virginity again. need sin. sub. wear 3 N95 masks permanent lung damage. ;) amazing examinations executed linked twitter feed, attribute heavy significance 2 opinion. Maybe read document slowly consulted someone qualified Belgium. know, california weather still nice. Restaurants bars popping. Everything outside, every table consistently filled. mean vaccinations general public likely mostly done then? get one day! cases 49 days vaccine. already diseases. No, vaccine free Americans... terrible? Pfizer Moderna 95% effective infection 66% effective SYMPTOMATIC infection. I'm biologist, suggest would probably lot asymptomatic people took vaccine spreading COVID around? Disappointed J&amp;J. 70% high enough. also seems South African variant whopper, efficacy vaccine 57% even lesser Novavax. mRNA vaccines proving superior. I'm sure market value play decisions export vaccine, probably pertinent mitigation negative press related AZs inability provide 30 million doses forecasted December UK. Moreover, know whether necessary storage capacity keep doses EU back exported doses. 

Regardless, pointless arguing 2 million doses whatever was. Goverments AZ need working solutions supply bottleneck increasing capacity. doses stockpile; can't anything cry foul about. dose increase tensions help anyone. Yeah, handled well. We're around bottom 10% think plant UK, chill off. Yeah, thanks. Scandal show main character always looks like sniffed ripe fart wondering. finally reaching conditional herd immunity worst affected areas. year (and counting) never ever getting back. atrocious handling pandemic got 10,000 people killed.   know kids safe.

Covid death rate kids literally less 0.02% happened back March imho. seems stupid get inside packed cigar tube strangers. fucking way. draconian. Yes people get test fly. Yes people quarantine arrive home. pay $2000 government fee quarantine hotel home. Yea that's basic immunology 2nd dose used There’s discussion. someone afraid infection wants higher level protection, seek effective vaccine. There’s ethical dilemma here. Exactly. People keep spewing like impressed. two Lamborghinis market, I’m jumping joy KIA. examples vaccine protection is. vaccine high efficacy fighting virus effective manor. staves outcomes. 

Zero risk tolerance impractical.  Hard truth people get covid problems it. equate setting fire way life forever always. It’s also masks probably regular element society while...for want wear them.  government mandate side distancing likely ends year Could much lower numbers US caused much lower mobility holiday season over? examples reported. tell is, example, overal effectiveness BioNTech vaccine unkonw tested people symptoms trial, meanwhile AZ Sinovac test everyone periodically. COME BRAZIL one conclude 2022 coronavirus over. Absolutely not. soon summer happening freedom. Tyler Perry Oprah black people. hope people think like stop producing administering mRNA vaccines. could Norway’s Germany’s numbers. war trade countries delivery issue wonky firm. Seems eager make sell check able deliver per contracts. fact I'd expect shortcomings towards UK too. still get others. wait end summer get mRNA one week get J&amp;J get protection Deadlier outcomes, would jump waitlist mRNA get J&amp;J meantime. thing is, 5.4 clause *also* refers specifically initial doses manufactured. Clause 5.1 *when* initial doses supposed distributed (after market approval), clause 5.4 *where* shall manufactured (at various sites EU UK). clearly don’t know 66% efficiency rate works lmao. Experts literally recommend vaccine even 60% effective. 

They tried failed? Tell countries still trying buy J&amp;J 90% effective vaccines can’t administered everyone fast enough due storage, supply, etc.

Don’t spread misinformation, smart guy. Yes, thank you. feel like I'm taking crazy pills seeing everyone saying ""give less effective vaccine young people!"" No. Young people 50+ years ahead get vaccine prevents chronic illnesses (and prevents spreading it!) give J&amp;J vaccine elderly mostly sit home anyway need severe illness prevented. definitely. think ""fear"" virus rising. Fear low ever I'd say. Ooh drink normally £1+, it'll fly תודה על הטיפ, חדשת לי 😄 
חשבתי ששתי המילים ברורות. אזכור זאת בפעם הבאה שאשתמש במילה. 
ואם כבר מדברים... 
כתבת ""אוזניים ישראליים"", אך יש לכתוב ""אוזניים ישראליות"" (ואף עדיף ""אוזן ישראלית""). בכל אופן, תודה לך. העברית שלך מאוד טובה (ולא היה ביכולתי לדעת כי אין זו שפת אמך לולא אמרת לי). 
בכל אופן, להבא אכתוב תלמיד ולא אישון👁️ 😊 suspect UK basically made AstraZeneca steal pre-produced vaccine doses paid made EU.

The UK contract AZ paid 100m vaccines early order long EU. trying rude. saying, constant fear healthy. Hypochondria sorted professional help. state that? doubt. Current tempo one lowest. statement makes sense. Swine flu human influenza virus. gone human ? pig back human. It’s similar novel coronavirus strains go human mink human, end it’s still SARS CoV2 virus, different variant.

Swine flu lethal younger patients influenza viruses novel variant. set big alarm bells reason taken seriously.   What's difference disease infection? infection viral entry cells replication? Also thought conclusive data yet people vaccinated can't spread virus, hence need masks social distancing still ? guess must personal thing wear masks fine. We’ve got critical thinker drink light one /s means? I'm n00b   second this. Also don’t get this: Public Transit local issue. national public transit Amtrak IIRC. Talk leave country lol! Required strong word. Based TV anywhere 20-60% people bothering. one used terms discriminate British/South African people. They've saying result first dose anyway since late nov / early December wouldnt put lot stake people say online. online comments meant anything governor would actress previous political experience.  boosters never get widespread use. can't even get current vaccines world population late 2022. 7B people lot people....

The virus around forever. People need accept this. I’m appreciating everything much post Covid - loads stuff friends, enjoying movies, restaurants pesky masks. I’m gonna burn mine.   85% reduction serious illnesses 100% reduction deaths big thing people need focus on.

It's odd soon vaccines became reality, narrative shifted ""Keep hospitals overwhelmed"" ""Eradicate COVID!"" 2%... far.  think they’d use rapid tests helps clarify. Yea, they’re near other, would still useful pinpoint isolate infections even spread already happened. dont need give away.. already paid :D 

Ours coming EU plant Okay, I'm sure we're discussing lol. EU started war.

Are referring spat EU found UK? fact countries seem priority vaccine manufacturers detriment middle- low-income countries (86% global population)? This. 

No way EU would let AZ, Moderna Pfizer/Biontech continue shipping EU EU still desperate....

I'm irritated Canadians (me) much responsible pandemic, we've kept numbers fairly Americans fucked around willy nilly, worst leadership world plan, somehow getting vaccinated faster us.

They spread conservative bullshit Covid big deal cold single shot gives almost 70% protection disease much higher protection severe version forming ""Whhhhhaaaas""

Like grandma holding hoping single shot waiting line 5 hours twice maybe even getting cause supply really viable age. almost 90% protected developing severe Covid, almost 70% protected assist getting plus take regular precautions actually leave house live life (she's 80 vaccinated pretty much stuck home) would love number. I'm pretty sure correlation = causation world coronavirus, therefore conclude ending restrictions led fewer cases. Good job, Newsom. depend live They’ll start vaccinating frontline workers next week, maybes numbers much higher (considering many workers health staff) evidence spread inconclusive. people, including myself, waiting immediate loved ones vaccinated. that, know much i'd personally care go hospital nursing home. Thank fuck need precise definition word “Children,” 74 year old kid well known world last four years. another one videos. watch risk. *Secret Swedish virology research facility/ zombie virus outbreak* word “can” lot work. could mean “there’s possibility could get infected don’t know” could mean “we know get infected”. phrase, different implications. understanding don’t know.

Terrible situation there. I’d legitimate concerns opening back hospitals longer threatened.  herd immunity flu (right?). worry every year wipe half million Americans 12 months. 

I think inevitably get herd immunity within years. We'll get boosters along way it'll become part lives little while. seems like start getting back normal vaccines. Pandemics always end TV stations get. TV still runs world. Oh, downvotes adorable. Bless little cotton socks. technical discussion vaccine types development? Feel free care Less money means stress, less career advancement, financial stress still pay school

Damn, think much society hinges one career field. must highly compensated well-respected. there's study says long term symptoms highly correlated hospitalizations, is, long covid typically follows severe disease. try finding r/covid19, honestly reason going much people sub. rest assured looks like government ignoring redditors r/California Europe losing shit new variants? almost like want end.

Right Europe continent dystopian restrictions. think rise majority. going taught school interaction intimacy bad good parent would well. thing EU didn’t ban anything, it’s adding layer export control. doesn’t matter doses made. matters understand whether AZ (or producer) really unable provide promised doses EU production issues prioritizing countries Thank you. You’re guy gets pissed girlfriend calling already jerked off. Gosh people trying really hard spin great news. Every single vaccine prevents deaths. Every. Single. One. one however, garbage outside that. mad think open licence would given anyone incentive bear risks costs clinical trials.... Mad, tell you! European. Sorry EU. get chance vote it. shitty superstate forced me. know none ""good news,"" *better* news UK variant dominate strain regards vaccine efficacy? legit idea effectively saying. infection enters body. disease causes symptoms/damage. It’s issue like Texas mentality.. dumbass say let’s good wrong Fair enough. live province voted twice implement proportional voting (STV first time MMP second) come close passing, hold breath. People weirdly suspicious changing voting system, there's real status quo bias that's hard overcome even though we've elections 55% vote translated seats. American, ya'll forget dismal failure 'the Western Hemisphere' develop new moniker. 

You've earned it. There's tons variables need shake still, I'm guessing may guests want mask distance still, others won't. we'll make masks optional try organize things want outside so, want something ""normal"" so.

It's crazy try plan wedding 18 months even gotten vaccinated yet 😅 guess can't believe data vaccine purchases Bloomberg more. Novavax comes 89% efficacy people focus J&amp;J one “only” prevents hospitalizations.  It’d great one done solves whole thing looks like we’re going bunch 2 shots. 

If promises kept US would enough vaccinate 250MM people summer that’s excluding J&amp;J AZ.  solid number. Moderna 81% efficient first dose. would love by-then middle school aged kids vaccine starting fall semester. Would make lot comfortable. said, 74 year old mother still able get yet, state plan slated late summer. Sure hope bump vaccine cadence. Canada doesn’t even 1 million yet need help get! Nice, Europe hits 5% vaccination rate. TL;DR 

400 million doses agreed

it could help address supply shortages hindered Europe's vaccination campaigns. know, say was? brought ""beaches park"" thing, never said that, never heard anybody saying that, almost seems strawman argument me.

Nobody's saying absolutely critical wear two masks passing someone by.

Dude, post New Normal. We're done here. likely even helped much this. can, least see gastro doc least year. suppose drink shitload water now. to. According Mayoclinic - 

**Infection**, often first step, occurs bacteria, viruses microbes cause **disease** enter body begin multiply. **Disease** occurs cells body damaged — result **infection** — signs symptoms **illness** exactly countries like South Korea Taiwan Singapore Hong Kong opted operate long term guess what? worked. 

Americans want admit strategy ""No socialization ever!!!"" vs ""I care, I'm gonna party 1000 closest friends"" work long term national policy. mention whole leaving national security threat hands state governors mayors, coordinated all, recipe drastic failure.

Also, safe cases low necessarily safe cases high, that's another thing. COVID one-size-fits-all situation; hate phrase ""In pandemic!"" take account pandemic different levels different places. people Japan safely people Ukraine safely. Given ""World"" flair, think there'd acknowledgment that. I’m sure you’re saying doesn’t make sense. 


Swine flu 2009 lower fatality rate regular seasonal influenza strains. [From April 12, 2009, April 10, 2010, virus infected 60 million people U.S....those cases resulted 12,500 deaths, fatality rate 0.02% wasn’t “novel.” H1N1 type also caused 1918 pandemic, similarities enough seasonal flu [natural level immunity big problem people simply lying vaccinated go maskless. see anti-maskers coming kinds supposedly medical excuses already, like said like bar able verify.

I think mask orders (and will) stay effect certain vaccination threshold across entire population reached. did, I'm calling moron, needs done often. may stupid know moron, I'm let know. one needs/values opinion. get vaccine still wear mask reassure others even though vaccine?

At point get stop masks? Lord Fauci grants blessing? ""This vaccine protects death still get fever. Useless! wait 6 months mRNA vaccines instead."" Get vaccines resume normal life. state bad state overly restrictive, may time consider move better one.

My weekend consist going movie, going college basketball game, going dinner etc...

Life’s actually normal lot places, get shot, make normal too. too. world 2019 return assure you.  elaborate think that?

I'm mostly reading papers. news generally positive compared see research. major point missed far 5.4 EU mandate AZ enter contracts manufacturers (CMOs) EU (and UK) expand production event **the Initial Europe Doses** able produced EU.

The UK’s production via three CMOs, surprised no-one pointed yet. They’re Cobra Biologics, Oxford Biomedica CP Pharmeceuticals, anyone interested. likely states make decision, I'm hopeful everywhere optimal. Taiwan ranked #3. [Here's full enroll study. Asking friend. Europeans risk-averse Americans. I'm surprised. Brilliant news! Let's take moment savour good news, amongst usual dirge."
