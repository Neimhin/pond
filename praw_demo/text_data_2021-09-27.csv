I‚Äôm parks week people aren‚Äôt wearing masks, that‚Äôs something would make uncomfortable might best time.  Family friends work connections. serious illness (3 deaths total) people apparently underlying conditions, COVID straw broke camel‚Äôs back. Others fairly mild cases.

My original comment honest question, trying understand people‚Äôs basis isolating unvaccinated distinct danger vaccinated.

Vaccinated populations significantly slow spread virus best dead end transmission. vaccinated low risk infection present low risk transmission.

We multiple risk factors.

1. Moderate risk unvaccinated player infected.
2. Low risk infected unvaccinated player transmitting asymptotically.
3. Low risk vaccinated player encountering someone infectious large majority interaction among vaccinated.
4. Low risk vaccinated player infected.
5. low risk transmission vaccinated player unless symptomatic, detectable.

When multiple layers risk, small adjustment single risk factor often little effect overall risk.

Based premise, feel like increasing percentage vaccinated players 85% 100% would little statical significance overall risk outcome. TIL consequences authoritarian. one idiots I've heard much about. shoes I'd expect reverse

Except didn't. Lot countries exported donated vaccines vaccinating children even young adults.  vaccinating kids? 30 years exactly ""fast"" Chances won't. many jabs think Kyrie taken surgeries? would imagine needles chemicals vast majority people non-chronic maladies. Particularly age.

Nah weird selfishness. Massive amounts local anesthesia painkillers OK directly help him. Nothing them. Vaccines put crowd everyone else. exactly point vaccines exactly refuse them. It‚Äôs right OP article  Kyrie. Dude fashions civil rights leader, imagine odds actual icon movement thinking he‚Äôs dumbass. Realistically, since basically security features CDC vaccination card, sufficient allow people show pictures vaccination cards. Hell yeah call pill Ivirmicten we're good  think increasingly limited section important updates. one must tangential enough section. O'toole's tool gets ratchet. looks shorter real life. feel like recall process everything else happening Florida/Texas probably brought us best outcome. Everyone(In California) realized bad things states. US 7 day average dropping two weeks now, continuing drop. Uruguay 90% vaxxed (for 12yo, lots 18yo Chinese vaccine getting pfizer booster shot ), government refuses make compulsory. 
I don‚Äôt know good strategy, 90% good number 7-day average states release weekend numbers dropping. 7-day average country whole dropping 2 weeks now.  Bringing point NBA commissioners unilaterally made decisions past. Stern played almost role earlier trades largely gave Jac Sperling Dell Demps autonomy team management, pulling retrospective ‚ÄúDell Demps doesn‚Äôt authority make trades‚Äù stuff. Stern‚Äôs role ‚Äúowner rep‚Äù clearly conflict interest poorly designed. said years later Dell Demps horrible GM, yet nothing. literally popped veto trade owners (e.g. Dan Gilbert) whined Lakers forming another super team Lakers would luxury cap they‚Äôd lose revenue sharing.

Regarding unions, ask pilots‚Äô unions, teamsters, police unions, etc‚Ä¶ ‚Äúconcerns‚Äù mandates doing. United Airlines ask union position, issued mandate advance told it‚Äôs happening. three unions conceded employers right mandate vaccines, they‚Äôd lose court challenged.

Unions can‚Äôt stop mandates, it‚Äôs become clear employers move unilaterally interest public health. single union successful stopping mandate court. ‚Äúhands tied‚Äù BS doesn‚Äôt play vaccines middle declared pandemic, look every vaccine fight nation. system depends entirely altruism selflessness participants fundamentally flawed.

New collective bargaining horizon well. chance NBA going pick fight players union.   Um....
It's easy executive order, contractors need vaccinated. Time everyone move California. assertion get mild been. disputed actual experts, diseases like measles show reduced virulence. I've seen, basically clear happen evidence selective pressure non-virulence strong.  know rural conservative family masks vaccines, they‚Äôve stopped wearing seatbelts. includes children car seats. Sort of. 

While think professions sports marginal value society football particularly risky sport, I'll first admit get information NFL attempt motivate risks (as long mitigation cut deeply profits).

Making everyone get vaccine little risk causing much profit loss, optics likely better not. Changing rules reduce head injuries, changing helmet design, going hurt profits much, even though they're cost, especially helmets. Changing game completely would significantly reduce profits.  Oooh vintage reference days! ‚ÄúSimply unable grasp seriousness situation‚Äù 

That‚Äôs true. 
Kareem people lose face think it‚Äôs simple. Every player refuses vaccine would reasons reason stated simply case.

Scandinavian countries opening reclassifying Covid regular respiratory virus much like common flu US follow suit   virus allowed reproduce spread large (unvaccinated) population, inevitably mutate/evolve become infectious simply way natural selection.

Introduction 
To eliminate COVID-19 pandemic, transmission virus SARS-CoV-2 among population needs blocked and/or least reduced. Upper respiratory tract viral loads highest early stages disease, high loads associated higher mortality rates. study aims evaluate virucidal efficacy AOS2020, novel sprayable Acid-Oxidizing solution containing pure stable hypochlorous acid (HClO), human coronavirus SARS-Cov-2 vitro, tolerability profile nasal oral mucosa suggesting potential solution upper respiratory hygiene. 
 
Method 
Virucidal assays intranasal oral irritation tests undertaken accordance relevant national international guidance methods. 
 
Results 
In pre-clinical tests, AOS2020, virucidal efficacy in‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ1 min SARS-Cov-2. safety profile testing nasal oral mucosa indicates AOS2020 non-irritant. 
 
Conclusion 
These initial results indicate product potential treatment reduce viral load upper respiratory tract.  last thing holding us back normal life?

However, every person impacted breakthrough infection. work two days 5 vaccinated people infected barely interaction. face face meetings wore mask, others. much less ""more 15 minutes without mask closer 6 feet"" CDC weirdness. people still awaiting test results, expect vaccinated people test positive.

The major symptom ONS study include brain fog. But, first lot overlap, secondly, brain fog common super common, number would surely lot greater original one. Also, think included symptoms like anxiety. Literally anyone develop anxiety COVID infection, without long covid issues. So, think number still accurate (actually, according post's study, anxiety depression common symptom, including symptom leaving brain fog common probably going result ""false positive long covid cases""). many labs study coronaviruses? know? don't.

In meantime, want doubly sure, get vaccinated US November‚Ä¶ Long-term effects COVID survivors serious problem deserves attention, headline really egregious case weasel-wording scaremongering. author interviewed article makes tons assertions way beyond scope actual study, calls objectivity credibility serious question.

First, ""how common"" something ""for some"" fairly meaningless statement. Anything ""common"" narrow sample enough. study looked extremely narrow slice COVID patients: admitted ICU single facility narrow period time beginning pandemic, treatment different now. Even among group, half respond researchers' post-discharge inquiries, making unclear whether representative sample even narrow slice patients.

Second, ""long-term"" fairly misleading here, study looked symptoms 1-2 months discharge, provides evidence (one way other) happened patients responded that. One two months may fit definition ""long-term"" some, reasonable person would expect patients back normal one two months ICU 15 days (the median stay), many cases mechanical ventilation. 

Finally, scary headline ""long-term cognitive impairment"" based grand total five (5) patients. Three showed signs ""questionable"" cognitive impairment two showed signs impairment consistent dementia.

The 2 lines evidence listed.

People including bunch studies discussion provide background information saying ""numerous studies"" support main argument favor booster.

I tried linking video mine, 10 year old medical YouTube channel (Strong Medicine), discussing limitations booster data, got autoremoved containing unreliable link. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø Feel free search YouTube.

Copied comment  Assessment protection reinfection SARS-CoV-2 among 4 million PCR-tested individuals Denmark 2020: population-level observational  Prior infection COVID-19 reduces chances getting sick 80% six months, according study published Lancet March. people age 65, protection  Reduced Risk Reinfection SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 Vaccination ‚Äî Kentucky, May‚ÄìJune  CDC report released August found unvaccinated people previously COVID-19 2.34 times likely get reinfected vaccinated people who've it.  people went work vaccine one knew bad going get. know next patient Covid not, going get infect not.

Yeah, ""no self respect"", ""they hate"".... Jeesus get grip. god, hurry up, please? share link ""science clearly shows natural immunity is....perhaps better vaccine-induced immunity""? names authors look up. I'm curious. 

I've seen plenty data says otherwise thanks scientific method I'm willing change perspective data supports it. Hey unvaxed person, reason vax person need even vaccine cause failed get yours, let thing spread like wild fire. booster putting yet another layer fire proofing already fire proof self, bothered damn part putting forest fire. vax, masking, distancing shot life..... want cite need add layers protection dumb reason.... find comical authorize this

Pfizer actually requested authorization yet. NBC jumped gun headline edited fact. formal submission request emergency use authorization companies‚Äô vaccine expected follow coming weeks, officials said release. Yes, aware original news source title inaccurate- glad fixed it, thanks clarifying! Shady. Fear precursor change complicated that. 

First off, says COVID, mean did. Much like religious exemption vaccine, thing people absolutely saying get around getting vaccine. (To clear, issue religious exemptions, issue people dishonestly saying religion vaccines.) can't track actually antibodies, article say tested them, still need get vaccine. 

Second, natural immunity thing much complicated might think. I'm posting sources, science unclear this. fact matter know enough natural immunity who've COVID say degree better. better immediately after? 6 months? 6 years? know. again, getting vaccine safer patients wants help. good way weed bad healthcare workers. food works, keep eating? Incorrect. Unless you‚Äôd like post peer-reviewed article backs statement? We‚Äôll happily wait information. blogs, Facebook posts, so-called expert opinion, deep-state mass control narrative please. really Original submission EUA adults November 20, 2020. FDA panel met December 10. Time data submission application adolescents (12-15 years age) week. Correct, patient Covid three separate occasions. last time couldn‚Äôt believe might Covid kept spending time family ‚Äújust flu‚Äù wife hospital.  Good, menace society. Perhaps found way make lucrative infected workers? maybe want absorb anti-vaxxers workforce? know neither company right thing unless forced to.  Getting vaccine avoid getting sick - would ever considered that? problem ‚Äúunderstanding‚Äù there‚Äôs basis reality believe. It‚Äôs like understanding quitting job got worried unicorn stabbing death. Kareem Abdul Take Jab-bar let's take advice someone who's name anus master reddit.. sounds real smart.. 

Yet I'm least ridiculous one here. listen professionals, listen anecdotal evidence fear needles guess. people dying get shot let care vaccinated. 

Because fools walk around like petri dishes mutating virus, also clog hospitals making people wait treated die things   don‚Äôt clear recent drop life expectancy could reverberate generation. Parents right wary sending children school. Nearly every covid policy Florida going wrong direction, schools chose defy governor. 

There protections children.   Right? Let's reward actually want contribute country instead think ""freedom"" means ""total lack accountability responsibility"" Massachusetts, vaccine mandates motivated dozens state troopers submit resignation paperwork, State Police Association Massachusetts' (SPAM) President Michael Cherven said statement. 

Speaks itself, really.  Ha! Long covid debilitating people including children. Ten percent huge number people persistent symptoms low end estimate.  Hospitals bad place is, can't idiots purposely infecting (and others quarantine) avoid vaccine mandate utilizing natural immunity exemption.  F Florida stands Fuck Kids.  need public health, typhoid mary. Delta NYC. beating 1) decent, though amazing, vaccine rates, 2) insanely high levels natural immunity, 3) proof vaccine requirements vaccine mandates.

Don‚Äôt forget, wasn‚Äôt winter covid wrecked city April 2020. Everyone stuff indoors now. 

You speculating Delta ‚Äúhiding‚Äù north destroying Mississippi Texas. FDA takes seriously importance getting vaccines, shown safe effective children,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, nation's leading infectious disease expert, told MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" show. ""I would imagine next weeks examine data hopefully give O.K. start vaccinating children hopefully end October."" 
While Pfizer vaccine available Americans 12 older since May, millions elementary school-age children still vulnerable. 
Millions children returned classrooms in-person instruction recent weeks, districts requiring masks others not, one nation's hotly debated topics.

Prepare Republican meltdown approved. keep reinforcing truth getting children vaccinated definitively save multitude lives   Yeah, 6 billion doses distributed worldwide large enough data set, scrutinized vaccine rollout we've ever seen, we're seeing overwhelming majority hospitalized patients unvaccinated.

If want live functioning society takes appropriate measures keep way, go live fucking woods. Hang there, kid - vaccine hopefully coming soon.  medical field believe science?? Sometimes people like sound even dumber defending them, plenty jobs require vaccination stay hospitals.

Let's assume boosters significantly harmful (and suggesting are, outside worry administration young men myocarditis). simplicity, means need worry risk/benefit ratio - benefit. 

If boosters provide benefit people occupations relatively low-risk COVID exposure, provide benefit people occupations relative high-risk either. issue low vs. high risk magnitude benefit. words, beneficial vaccine would beneficial someone higher risk job compared lower risk job. vaccine benefit young healthy individuals, frequency risk occupation-related exposures irrelevant. simple fact scientific evidence favor giving boosters middle-aged young, healthy adults (EDIT: high risk professions) virtually non-existent.

First all, depends effectiveness defining acceptable. Even then, true considering severe illness hospitalization. considering mild moderate illness well, evidence expansive solid they're evidence presented Pfizer FDA CDC consisted of:

...2 studies? No, CDC considered numerous others. Many people watched meeting, know think gaining lying.

Further, antibodies unsuitable proxy goes entire body current evidence. No, mean B cell mediated memory systems anything, say physician explain why, I've got feeling understand what's going here. one ""America's Frontline think boosters dangerous, evidence beneficial many receiving them. Meanwhile, parts Africa get widespread access vaccine 2023...

Ah see problem. primarily logistical issue alleviated allowing mild moderate infections run rampant noble sacrifice. parts world could get quicker, remember that's happening fast possible. Boosters represent 2 weeks Pfizer's current production output. Forgoing boosters would limited impact thee small production allocation logistical issues dominating it.

""Your percentage"" depends mostly age; can't look vaccinated versus unvaccinated numbers since e.g. under-12s dramatically lower risk without vaccination over-80s vaccination.

Vaccination reduces individual chance infection (on given exposure) 70-90% chance hospitalization death infected least 70% (per UK's numbers). hard get accurate [Covid numbers Florida right

But long IS, I'll take whatever protection can, damned thankful it. COVID BSL 3, though. Also, majority BSL 4 labs urban centers hate bots Australia definitely put rather precarious position. handle onslaught cases bound occur current level paranoia? 

As we‚Äôve seen vaccine mandated universities US, even 95 100 percent vaccine coverage enough prevent transmission. course, cases mild asymptomatic nonetheless found mass testing. can‚Äôt imagine world‚Äî least perspective‚Äî AUS simply lets case count climb.

Yes 90% good enough. vaccine stop spread, 95% cases today among unvaccinated. point prior waves + high vaccination rates finally stop big surges?

German RKI calculated following:

if 65% (12-59yo) would vaccinate expect incidency 400 6.000 intensive care beds, 75% acceptance would reduce incidency 150 2.000 beds, 85% would keep incidency 100, 95% 50 beds basis mathematical models presented results surveys vaccination acceptance, consider target vaccination rate (vaccination protection full vaccination) 85% 12‚Äì59 year olds 90% people aged 60 necessary also achievable. vaccination quota reached time, pronounced 4th wave coming autumn / winter seems unlikely, provided population continues adhere basic hygiene measures addition vaccination and, number infections increases again, reduces contacts certain extent. don‚Äôt understand phobia is. It‚Äôs different little squeamish. yeah I‚Äôll tell grow balls whatever. advice? Depression kill people COVID keep going year year without family gatherings. many people negative positive news. really need cheerful life. can‚Äôt ‚Äúworse wave last year‚Äù winter given number vaccinations point. Thanks, indeed fine take second dose. Much appreciated! end ‚Äúkarma‚Äù list, again, priority placed patients condition sense moral justice. Health care shouldn‚Äôt play morals.  first judge one ""activist judges"" one party always warning side has. Regardless feelings policy, issue emergency injunction party requesting one strong likelihood victory merits, crystal clear frivolous case can't possibly win relevant laws caselaw. also French study suggested same, quite early (around May-July last year). highest vaccination gremium said STIKO recommends vaccine dose generally 6 months infection people confirmed symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. view increasingly better vaccine availability harmlessness vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection, administration vaccine dose possible 4 weeks end COVID-19   people confirmed asymptomatic SARS-Cov-2 infection, recommended single vaccination given early 4 weeks laboratory   People already vaccinated COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed direct pathogen detection vaccination receive second vaccination 6 months COVID-19 symptoms end COVID-19 symptoms received diagnosis. vaccine dose also given 4 weeks symptoms ended.

It definitely set mind right state approach quitting.

edit: smoked 16 years  Live let live, live expose others want live virus scientific bodies agree risk life.  ""Let live"" case means ""get vaccinated dont spread deadly virus people could kill,"" pro-vax liberal position. waiver ultra rich

Why? vaccine ultra rich? (Other taxed lot us). get it. Awkward   Read book exactly month ago. Never felt like smoking that. Always make point hang friend smoke still dont get urges!  disagree safe enough, think US vaccination rates high makes harder see full picture fully vaccination protects. 

In UK vaccination extremely high vulnerable, majority deaths currently vaccinated people. current death rates well outside normal rate middle flu season, middle summer. Excess deaths continue significantly higher average. still restrictions people cautious normal, would even worse everything truly back normal..So vaccination alone sufficient bring overal mortality rates back normal.


The way tried calculate comparison covid flu faulty several reasons. comparing partial population, partial season, accounting fact people's behaviour still different normal flu season, including mask wearing, preventing deaths. can't get anything without mine! guess could walk front door make floor, able use computer access med room, clean utility, soiled utility, anything important job  People brainwashed. get shot mean can't spread covid catch covid. whats point??? inject something body even work. vaccine effective think experience outlier?

Neither. level spread US, stories expected.

Hahah wish. got $2/hr raise back pay. staff hospital got less, even got anything all. That‚Äôs pay going like crazy. make good wage, nothing like travelers.

People flocking travel assignments pay handsomely trying get hell away bedside, already huge issue pre pandemic. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs clearance Clarence?‚Äù  someone help explain risk significantly decreases players vaccinated?

Unvaccinated higher risk symptomatic COVID, vaccinated still catch transmit, esp delta transmitting high volume.

Would overall risk still move significantly baseline small minority unvaccinated?

And overall risk also depend individual behavior (e.g., someone vaccinated acts pre-pandemic freedom vs. someone unvaccinated careful limit social interaction)?

I‚Äôm saying think risk adjustment would null, think focus frequent testing off-court behavior even meaningful.  two weeks make cartoons. Let‚Äôs see change tone.

I think anyone honestly thinks good math skills translates debating skills first place. know dialectic, i.e. logic human domain, logic math domain could equivalent complimentary overlap terms appreciating two different answers problem. sense argument could made conditions math student choose (solitary) correct answer. 


In math 1 acceptable answer. think happening math moment, using rules formulas order work equivalence find equilibrium. 

What means math comes expressing equation equal another equation, value. interpret correct answer. sum terms math is, say: 'This Value' = 'That Value' 


Whereas human realm; logic, dialogue, debate, etc. could well 2 sound arguments would term 'solutions' problem. However, given solution may appropriate certain contexts depending individual. 

In order think critically, one must able understand arguments surrounding issue terms strengths weaknesses using sound logic. far complex mathematical operations respect, many people actually consider entertain idea without feeling compelled either accept reject it? many days! oversimplification goes far deeper time mention course.

So terms equivalence, disagree you. 

However, terms rule set, agree extent. Rules math must followed else entire equation breaks equivalent answer invariably objectively incorrect.

Rules dialogue also exist, sadly ever taught rules, remain corrupted thinking, incapable intellectual honesty. quite pandemic sure. 

So agree general sense rules math, rules critical thinking. However, reasons stated above, two disparate rule sets little equivalence frameworks respective functions. One determined objective equivalence (this = that) subjectivity human experience. tad selfish absolutely major sports. :mikedrop: Canada.  Per capita factors population   multiple reasons likely believe official

Yeah, think u/Racoon_Full_of_Cum mainly talking original headline case.  think? paying tax? religion paying tax. mandate masks fully vaccinated people stating necessary. thought laid off.  Abstract 
Background Conflicting evidence emerged regarding relevance smoking risk COVID-19 severity. 
 
Methods undertook large-scale observational Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses using UK Biobank. recent smoking status determined primary care records (70.8%) UK Biobank questionnaire data (29.2%). COVID-19 outcomes derived Public Health England SARS-CoV-2 testing data, hospital admissions data, death certificates (until 18 August 2020). Logistic regression used estimate associations smoking status confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19-related hospitalisation, COVID-19-related death. Inverse variance-weighted MR analyses using established genetic instruments smoking initiation smoking heaviness undertaken (reported per SD increase). 
 
Results 421‚Äâ469 eligible participants, 1649 confirmed infections, 968 COVID-19-related hospitalisations 444 COVID-19-related deaths. Compared never-smokers, current smokers higher risks hospitalisation (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.26 2.29) mortality (smoking 1‚Äì9/day: 2.14, 95% CI 0.87 5.24; 10‚Äì19/day: 5.91, 95% CI 3.66 9.54; 20+/day: 6.11, 95% CI 3.59 10.42). MR analyses 281‚Äâ105 White British participants, genetically predicted propensity initiate smoking associated higher risks infection (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.10 1.91) hospitalisation (OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.13 2.27). Genetically predicted higher number cigarettes smoked per day associated higher risks outcomes (infection 2.51, 95% CI 1.20 5.24; hospitalisation 5.08, 95% CI 2.04 12.66; death 10.02, 95% CI 2.53 39.72). 
 
Interpretation Congruent results two analytical approaches support causal effect smoking risk severe COVID-19.  anyone know sure government shutdown Friday would affect FDA? difficult teliable data dince disease exists since 22 months first year everybody focussed finding cure vaccine. researchers time focus researching *long term* effects. need time data come solid *long term* effects research.

And much think retained?

Do think enough overcome lack critical thinking, ingrained political beliefs, forth?

And that's even microbiology covered...it probably many programs


There's little schooling practical experience nursing similar jobs relevant public health virology/immunology - treated like trade school. It'd sort like teaching civil engineering backhoe driver construction firm. really required job, needs know he's told within parameters job Bye trash bag. talking about? Someone tested positive rode car. use clean seats? They‚Äôre cloth. imagine people wrap visit ""glad got see me!"". That's narcissistic people say. feels good. That‚Äôs good hear majority nurses talking shit eventually gave in.  Versa rock. People suck.  never arguing good faith. Mandate vaccines terminate whose refuse. Let eat cake üç∞ received Tetanus shot?

That‚Äôs simply true, they‚Äôre least likely tested unless symptomatic. know nurses CNAs work hospital haven‚Äôt tested throughout pandemic. Also, due fact nursing home residents could exposed hospital, aren‚Äôt vaccinated, quarantine 14 days admission. vaccine, everyone quarantine. period last winter every admission one local hospitals turned positive quarantine. went hospital anything Covid, you‚Äôd end Covid. I‚Äôm also curious many patients saw extreme vaccine side effects vs died Covid. I‚Äôm sure numbers aren‚Äôt even remotely comparable. yup- thats understanding one actually resigned today. say ""good riddance!"" kid wife got flu shots last week declared ""Bandaid Bros"". 

It made getting flu shot easier him. hates shots.  Props you. issue taking anxiety meds after.

 centrist / moderate follow right / far-right talking heads. amount misinformation, ignorance, basic lack understanding, fearmongering, misrepresentation studies / stats astronomical. 

BTW, zero case anybody dying supposedly vaccine induced myocarditis, evidence caused actual heart damage biomarkers (inflammation equal damage necessary) besides myocarditis easily treated anti-inflammatory drugs. Great points, thanks insight. smaller dose causes smaller rate inflammation.

We know mRNA vaccines safe. need huge sample size. strange 3,000 person trial, for-profit trial system blame capitalism.   Haha, even better. sounds like Pfizer cut dosage 2/3‚Äôs. would cause larger rate inflammation? 

All questions brought end important questions answer. world Pfizer pushing 3,000 person sample size? seems like extremely small group people considering half probably aren‚Äôt getting vaccine?  Viral RNA present sample cause positive. There's way blood would introduce infected. I'm sure blood would inhibit reaction did, would probably get inconclusive result negative result. first step purifying RNA would think blood contamination would get removed. Hospitalization poor metric. course, abundance caution, people send kids hospital. There's evidence dangerous meaningful way age cohort unless numerous comorbidities. FDA's mandate. access risk vs benefit individual level. Allowing politicians power decide must carry documentation allows enter businesses eligible employment (and whatever else currently coming pipe), historically speaking - power never relinquished. 

Inevitably, governing body found *NEW* ways use this. literal history lawmaking United States.

Scholarly articles scholars. everyday folks. people absolutely clue interpret study designs, results, discern high quality study low quality one. Average Joe misreading pubmed ‚Äúresearch‚Äù. Bleach baths atopic dermatitis, UV phototherapy plaque psoriasis? FYI others, figured knew since used word.

But yeah, trying add info there's less ignorance stuff.  Here‚Äôs data: it‚Äôs 65s every 462 people get booster, 1 hospitalization prevented. 18-29s, takes 8,738 boosters prevent 1 hospitalization. approximately every 100 booster shots, 1 infection prevented. lot vaccines would strain supply much reward.

There also higher risk myocarditis (enlarged heart) younger people, risk unknown playing safe (slide 15) risk increased booster still 26 1 million.

The slides don‚Äôt discuss whether affect likelihood unvaccinated getting one (as shouldn‚Äôt, people love talk ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù, it‚Äôs free choice get one point stubbornness shouldn‚Äôt hold rest us back).

The CDC recommendation it‚Äôs hard get booster want one - there‚Äôs excess supply open appointments US don‚Äôt feel unethical get one. signed local pharmacy website got one questions asked, personally thought benefits outweighed risks. taking prednisone poison ivy didn‚Äôt check shit, easily get one want one.  idea talking about. people talk bleach UV light talking disinfecting surfaces, treating disease. viral diseases treat bleach UV light? string EOs OSHA requirement. different exclusively applied federal money thus challenges seem like summarily dismissed since chance could prevented.

The US public private partnerships tend result one sided gains Private corporations expense american public health. See high fructose corn syrup. regulations filming meat production. 

This resulted public health crisis black americans. 

So first step is, private corporate motivations companies involved? US government uphold public interest making sure health outcomes considered citizens? 

There early fears heart problems arising vaccines. Black americans long family histories heart problems. caused issues remained? early fears handled? 

The vaccine created ""record"" time. done? shortcuts process? ideas vaccine originate?

The Trump administration implicated number ways meddling CDC response pandemic. anything self serving affect development vaccine? meddle process? 


**Its scholarly research detailing ingredients development vaccine. researching private corporate public institutional motivations facilitated development. type research January June got fully vaccinated.

**Lastly, got vaccinated Pfizer. respect Germany's global leadership Pfizer private corporation, least accountable stringent EU regulation malevolent, selfish anyone hesistant vaccine. think microchip it. fearful private corporations best interest mind public institutions indifferent plight, video accessible gives baseline information really break thos real fears. work hospital medical professional can't understand vaccine works fired long   I've heard one. kinda true. lungs nothing scar tissue fluid covid, work. no.

The first human clinical trial using ex vivo dendritic cells transfected mRNA encoding tumor antigens (therapeutic cancer mRNA vaccine) started 2001.[26][27] Four years later, successful use modified nucleosides method transport mRNA inside cells without setting body's defense system reported.[26][28] Clinical trial results mRNA vaccine directly injected body cancer cells reported 2008.[29][30]

SARS-CoV-2, opposite. I've never met many virulent antivaxxers one population I've seen prison staff police. Well, unvaccinated Americans overwhelmingly idiots, much care think. felt way yesterday. someone posted link several completed studies long term effectiveness moderna compared pfizer i'm pretty relaxed whether approve it.

not say care one way (i'd prefer booster even fraction % improvement, since risk) i'm going anxious approve quick facts help reinforce this:

Nearly 6.2 **billion** shots already administered 2.59 **billion** people around globe. That's 33% human population. vaccines ""untested unsafe"". However flimsy arguments December 2020, utterly irrelevant as, again, **2.59 billion vaccinated people** attest. 

As far children go, *already* vaccinate children following diseases: hepatitis b, meningitis, rotavirus, diptheria, tetanus, polio, influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, HPV, name few. ""Vaccinating children"" dangerous harmful; getting diseases young (or time really) dangerous harmful. ""I've driven drunk many times without getting accident. suddenly considered dangerous?""

(In seriousness, common belief drunk driving penalties enhanced 1970s.) know fact 12+ did: end stories like this: case 5-12 needs researched thoroughly need another RSV vaccine situation. dEy tOoK eR jErBs! Wow interesting. got mine zero side effects, even sore arm. second Pfizer dose wiped though. nObOdY wAnTs WoRk AnYmOrE I'm sorry stage longer get vaccine hesitancy. Sure december could sort understand given brand new vaccine tested like 20k 40k people clinical trial. may feel hesitancy since could argue rare side effects could show later on. stage US 390 million doses administered across world thsn 6 billion doses administered. vaccine given enough people show safe vast majority people we've seen anybrare side effects blood clots myocarditis etc extremely rare benefits still vastly outweigh risks. Change title We're allowed editorialize titles posted is. Get done! putting there, likely reason exposed flu nearly two years, immunity waned.

This years shot significantly different past years, quadrivalent thing many times before. think it... take pandemic people understand this? hospitals asking questions past 20+ years? like South. fact, stay South. Thanks link. nauseating. I'm OK timeline. 


Correct. went 300,000 deaths almost 700,000 deaths year.....she could kill lot people ""couple years"".    


I guess thinks entitled Luxury though.  (Strange real nurse would think way. know life dear.  seems get that).   


She nothing give moment time, self-pity victim-posture. We're going feel pretty stupid sprinted headlong forced reopenings end generation kids experiencing symptoms years come. 

But know, I'm one idiots still wearing mask.  Im sure it. thought get less sick still contagious non vaxed. Great excuse get gym class. This. Pfizer‚Äôs data showed cases myocarditis kids studied. 3 times, damn. feel regardless situation choices. still hate see anyone suffer. ‚ÄútRUth‚Äù Bros pros. can‚Äôt see won‚Äôt go tits hospitals say ""fuck"" internet. ok. get mad you. couldn‚Äôt imagine wearing masks Disney.

My 4 year old niece loves Disney sister dying take her.

They're provided free here, that's certain groups get them.

In U.S. generally free think I'm sure. Since there's tier structure health costs based employment I'm completely sure vaccines government-sponsored ones paid insurance. general, pediatrician recommended us get flu shots every year get them. Also employer brings people around time year give free flu shots want UK's JCVI completely apolitical group scientists charge recommending vaccinations. considered effects individual teenager since benefit vaccine marginal recommend given it.

I think standpoint, *hurt* see problem giving children vaccines. feels like different standards different situations. pandemic, something *might* positive outcome real risks I'd favor approving it. situation example acne medication might work, would want studied approving factor things like whether self-isolate effect society.

In U.S. role CDC rather FDA feel like FDA stepped job description booster shots. know similar setup UK another group responsible taking public health factors consideration. factors think concern UK things like mask mandates banned mask-wearing discouraged schools, social distancing encouraged much less enforced, requirements even report COVID cases much less sort temporary online schooling event major outbreak trying point Covid particularly dangerous individual level, absolutely terrifying epidemiological one. vaccinating children make significant difference. distracts actual issue gets people's hopes somehow better done.

I think matter perspective, wrote long explanation going disconnect levels government U.S. assume UK federalized degree able unified response. There's lot issues fall outside realm public health contributing problems though gets topic. However, adds situation people feel forced focus individual health opposed overall common good. can, much less likely, less contagious. Nope. cook infected anyone ever worked asymptomatic carrier bacterium causes typhoid fever failing take simple precaution hand washing getting infectious excrement food prepared. I‚Äôm sure problems really solved, polarized. Takes structure change policy change lasting impact. things highlighted could drastic impacts social welfare unintended, like work home movement displace people areas previously disconnected tech hubs such. Excellent. I'm one folks whose body always hates flu shots. Gonna Friday, though. 

Oddly enough, routine childhood vaccines? Nothing. varicella booster came negative antibodies. get literally three times. Nothing would happen. many 30-somethings that, lemme tell you. 

But flu shots? body goes, ""FULL BATTLE MODE"". Go figure. see vaccinnation rates MA? cops minority, deserve law enforcement priortiy disrupting public safety.

Digital vaccine passes foregone conclusion - especially things like international travel.  Good little back tried explain someone Politics thread need study long term side effects vaccine symptoms present shortly take it, years future anything like that. backed three four articles explaining was, would see random person making claim.

Yeah, asked even read wrote called moron. lot people already made mind there's hidden side effect people going struck year matter offer show can't possibly case. good thing. Ignorant people belong responsible jobs. FYI, year's flu shot quadrivalent doozy. I'm getting mine Friday, wife colleagues (doctors) got pretty tired achy theirs.

Hopefully next summer we‚Äôre able completely move on. fuck lmao  FDA requested larger sample concerns myocarditis, Pfizer wait increase sample. understand, additional sample (1,000 kids, think) didn‚Äôt increase total sample size sufficient really turn enough cases rare adverse event add much understanding safety. Even risk higher shown smaller sample, shouldn‚Äôt affect decision-making EUA approval individuals myocarditis occurs often among unvaccinated people get Covid, unless there‚Äôs specific group kids risks outweigh benefits‚Äîwhich, exists, probably way small identify trial data gathered far.  

I‚Äôm pissed delay made horribly stressful, dangerous start school year without likely uncovering new risks. wonder one consideration FDA‚Äôs demand data able reassure vaccine-hesitant parents did, fact, take closer look myocarditis risk. case, let parents desperate protect kids Covid exposure school vaccinate kids sooner hesitant parents wait since parents would wait anyway. Knowing families vaccinated kids probably far compelling larger sample size. 

When said done, hope FDA CDC pressured rethink approach things realize account human behavior get way better communication. sounds like lot people great hard science, really need help ‚Äúsofter‚Äù sciences, especially comes fast-moving pandemic. Like people refuse vaccines reason decide use monoclonal antibodies severe COVID reactions uses stem cells. work post op floor. I've worked back back shifts, one covid unit next day post ops countless times past year half. I've also pulled covid floor non covid floor shift. hospitals care kind thing others don't. work hospital vaccinated, deserve worse fired. deserve put list can't employed healthcare again. That's seriously even extreme, point. idiots deserve go back healthcare stupidity? matter time anti vaxxers start blame overcrowded understaffed ICUs vaccine mandates. I‚Äôm assuming articles metric new Covid cases. imagine guard folks bus guard around. Says Pfizer stock holder. Commenting Fox ‚ÄúNews‚Äù website articles get religious exemption driving drunk? morality holding society hostage endless pandemic? don‚Äôt want live like anymore. They‚Äôre forcing time dangerously full hospitals chance breakthrough infections us. 

I‚Äôm really tired hearing idiot‚Äôs ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù infect others. Much like ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù carry guns inappropriate places.

‚ÄúYour freedom swing arm ends nose begins.‚Äù shows lack critical thinking matter. deleted comment minimum realized wrong. need another paycheck? employer pay last month?

Right could definitely see happening. There's big labor shortage right employers kind desperate. local paper story earlier week several restaurants closing doors can't get applicants. work pay well market we're can't get applicants either. going throw job trash, probably best time honestly. important... person wants nurse first place said person know care first? can‚Äôt answer that, I‚Äôll tell this:

I‚Äôm someone masked up, gotten COVID, gotten vaxxed, thought could without masks. masked again, continue even work.

I don‚Äôt trust government, also hate Trump Republican talking points making shit political. Giving crap others shouldn‚Äôt political, unless others people actively looking harm others, dig heels rhetoric beliefs talk others, refuse right others done. We‚Äôre essentially right told care unvaccinated, unvaccinated don‚Äôt care anyone themselves. kids risk, people done right things continue so.

Once kids able get vaccinated, governments Federal State level going hard time convincing even people like still need wear masks. I‚Äôm cool wearing moving forward option, especially flu season uptick. cool mandated I‚Äôm sick like everyone else. certainly cool mandated protect unvaccinated.

So although can‚Äôt answer question again, stance kids able get vaccinated, you‚Äôre going hard time convincing even reasonable people continue mandated wear masks cautious others. Dude I'm waiting get telepathic communication still, day state New Jersey 1/21 size California entire state fit LA Orange County spend lot time working federal prisons (federal defense lawyer). many guards well educated uber Trumpists. cannot imagine many staff flat refuse jab. Given massive staff shortages already exist, can't see enforced. I'm triple vaxxed militant issue get. even got booster MMR last year reading somewhat encouraging studies innate immunity. said, think going impossible order comply with. seems silly. plain laziness.  kidding anti-vax aunt started posting toothpastes since fluoride That's really get ""natural immunity"" types. mean yeah maybe immunity get covid good little better vaccine, but.... get covid first, risk potential long term health problems death. Meanwhile vaccine essentially risk free. really is, trust me. Trying explain this, even nitty gritty work. Give data give death.

Any credible viewpoint given time attention deserves. 

Internet folks got tired explaining science 12 months ago. That's people get shit talking nonsense now. We're tired.  models good part math part, really account human behavior. 

Something interesting see normal flu season year. 

If flu season minor like last year, would suggest people still cautious, slips caution still happen result increased COVID spread. 

If normal flu season though addition COVID manageable, would really encouraging really gotten ""back normal I've spent last 18 months far-right, anti-vaccine, anti-lockdown/mask fringe, I've changed mind everything. I've booked first dose.

If even find one. Sold everywhere around me. point children already low risk Covid, worth vaccinating like countries give flu chicken pox vaccines. harm them? No. going provide significant benefit, really need it. controversial thing say. UK's vaccination committee recommend 12-18 year olds get vaccinated, since provides relatively marginal benefit them.

The whole pandemic protecting health system. never protecting yourself, children parents, since part majority recover. ensuring health system collapse still provide care people. unvaccinated adults (including young ones, case think think vaccinated) responsible that.

Americans seem thinking vaccinating children suddenly change situation. won't. negative effect? No. benefit small face overwhelming hospitalisations adults. response still seems individualistic. ""Oh well family vaccinated, we're fine."" pretty irrelevant since individual level, always relatively safe. know much NBA, players LOT influence power pretty much major professional league around world. 

As result, high profile players anti-vax. Kyrie Irving, all-star player Brooklyn Nets, infamous stances various issues.

Quite contrary. ones I've assumed sitting hands FDA. Pfizer gave FDA results back July, FDA randomly told Pfizer enough people clinical trials (which FDA told front Spring concern.) also saw FDA initially vote boosters recently, making bizarre arguments echoing vaccine availability globally despite FDA's job ensure vaccines safe effective. public health expert fully admit could wrong, perspective FDA slow reactive throughout whole pandemic. plenty blame go around over, that's main criticism them.  /r/OmadDiet though, would realistic question. üôÇ Uneducated Americans also say dumb kids graduate college means college worthless.

I‚Äôm sure build real comfortable bunker live days maybe.  Also Karl Anthony Towns several family members fucking die Covid Since serious question, here's serious, non-condescending answer. :)

The virus likes replicate. defense replication immune system. vaccine trains immune system recognize virus react quickly virus particles enter system.

The virus smart, replicate replicate, often point killing host. think virus mass tiny particles, quantity - easy figure someone vaccinated would far fewer virus particles someone unvaccinated. vaccinated host's immune system working efficiently therefore host fewer virus particles spread around. 

And that's important part: simple math reduce number virus particles environment, reduce probability someone sniff one get sick. measures reduce spread based basic math science. 6-foot/2-meter distancing example, relies [inverse square quantity virus particles present air proportional square distance, move away dramatically reduce number particles space dilution.

So take multiple steps - distancing, killing virus surfaces via sanitation, yes, wearing masks (which way meant reduce particles air *just like methods*).

The vaccine gives immune system head start, basically taking away analysis trial-and-error portions responding foreign pathogen like virus. best way reduce number virus particles environment (along masks, distancing, etc.) reducing particles, reduce potential spread reaches point virus eliminated large swaths population (which also makes easier manage areas still present).

TL/DR: vaccinated, person potential contribute many virus particles environment, turn means easier people inhale virus multiply.  Thank comment. Could please advise possible? able trace name date birth always 2 Pfizer shots?

As long vaccine-hesitant people there, we'll never reach critical threshold necessary reduce effective reproduction number 1, means masking, social distancing good hygiene still required control spread.

However, four measures supplemented oral antivirals test positive--both unvaccinated persons smaller number breakthrough cases among fully vaccinated--then reduce likelihood positive cases spread.

Your number larger mostly counting people yet eligible Like said, wake spring 2022 tell changed. possibility hospitals community may bankrupt, thousands good doctors nurses left field due burnout treating entirely preventable disease ICU...........

Many people died reason, things describing happened. also something changed--there immunity. Many kids vaccinated, almost every unvaccinated person gotten covid (resulting immunity death).  can't people anymore.

 vaccine safe. effective. reason mandated make sure mouthbreathers windowlickers accidently infect poor patient legitimately ineligible vaccine (chemo patients).

Henh? I'd like know immunity exposure plays that. People get either exposed infected surely level immunity, studies show someone recovered better immunity vaccine. surely large percentage population immune this. Even 10-20% population immune way would tip balance.   bee eh-*faaaiiiyaahhh*, 100% already got RTFA Paradoxically think fewer cases densely populated areas, places people educated accept vaccine, whereas sparsely populated rural areas refuse it. absolutely vaccinate children flu US, 6 months old. Every year. amazing many advisory panel members seem understand they're reaching excuse all, especially ones perceive acceptable, think boosters actually going impact uptake.

The thing moving needle mandates seeing family members get fucked hard delta. find interesting current wave cases hospitalizations declining even though new interventions. Boosters become widespread, vaccination rates increased lot past couple months, virtually restrictions parts country, schools open, many back work, etc. yet cases declining. agree think probably last major wave US.

The degree future waves driven level vaccination area, think vary lot locality. I'm DC metro area high rates vaccination, drive hour two rural area low. going predict rolling waves outbreaks rural areas population centers largely unaffected. show stats ""Virginia"" it'll vary lot county county. suspect rest country similar. Looking data state means mixed together. I'd love see chart cases hospitalizations based population density county in. bet paradoxically we'd see fewer cases high population areas people highly vaccinated. Agreed. Death keep climbing bit longer follow cases drop. lol they're dumb shit. latest series recondite ideas, probably ""just flu"" people. People go ""because fake numbers"" annoy usually idea China actually doing.

The early numbers course unreliable testing atrocious days. case numbers post May 2020 probably accurate nations.

China screen high risk workers regularly test everyone Covid symptoms general population. soon one positive case found, whole neighborhood goes lockdown. Western lockdown, kind ""you can't leave home, deliver groceries you"" kind lockdown, everyone get tested. cannot trace source cases keep increasing, whole city goes lockdown. essential workers like hospital staff delivery people allowed leave homes. whole city get tested, usually two three times over. China done 6 7 cities far. latest Fujian early September. 

Whenever someone test positive, go hospital observation facility, whether symptomatic not, whether want not. Little kids young 3 4 taken isolation parents can't stay them, even vaccinated. inhuman caused lot suffering, seem effective controlling spread. shit. love throwing tantrums would get fired this? No. It‚Äôs disgusting let selfish ignorant people harm everyone else getting vaccinated.

Labor sellers market, mandating people told easily replaceable something really want result unvaccinated workers working elsewhere, unfortunately.  article quoted supports 95% stat. 43,000 employees New York City's 11 public hospitals, 5,000 vaccinated, Dr. Mitchell Katz, head NYC Health + Hospitals, said news conference de said 95% nurses vaccinated group's facilities ""open fully functional"" Monday. research means listened expert meme social media.  admit nothing troll. ty info Sir might find interesting:  emergence SARS-CoV-2 variants mutations key antibody epitopes raised concerns antigenic evolution erode immunity. susceptibility immunity viral evolution shaped part breadth epitopes targeted. compare specificity antibodies elicited mRNA-1273 vaccine versus natural infection. neutralizing activity vaccine-elicited antibodies even focused spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) infection-elicited antibodies.

Vaccines required attend public schools 50 states DC. It‚Äôs way decades. Per NY Times morning, she‚Äôs one 300 18,000 vast majority folks rush get vaccinated. 

Everybody‚Äôs gangster it‚Äôs time gangster shit. get it. used live Texas myself. *everything's bigger* easy joke dark time. Please take offense. someone summarize main points this? asking login Well let‚Äôs see testing priority vaccinated ppl still spread virus? Poor vaccination rates combined uneven access healthcare one get sick. Mmmhmm dont know anyone else looked states covid rates daily dropping alot states arent giving numbers.... sure average number drop 1/3 half states give numbers way Florida numbers like 8 deaths day. fing way   gofundme page would say would give shirt back. still friend guy?  Believe science? believe science ain't science. experts long credited California‚Äôs success state‚Äôs higher average vaccination rates thoughtful virus mitigation measures, including mask vaccine mandates. everyone unvaccinated, people somewhat following restrictions, could choose reduce exposure enough good chance avoiding exposure, thus immunity altogether. stopped avoiding, fertile ground new mutation, long COVID, etc.

With combination Delta removal restrictions, risk gone away completely, almost guaranteed exposed unless self-imposed lockdown. vaccine highly protective, course.

As such, much stronger position suppress new variants get ground. liberal essentially means live let live.

Forcing people take vaccine liberal position. It‚Äôs opposite. many millions Americans model behavior sports entertainment stars

Hell, Americans either Yes bet films well it‚Äôs necessarily true

Pretty sure like 60% NBA players go broke years leaving league I'm willing bet fool part 60%  Fun fact: kid played timmy didn‚Äôt think kareem acting actually grabbing stuff. Kareem probably seriously upset Good thing arent charge yikes Hope soon! want nurse. wonder people dying hospitals ‚Äúunderstaffed‚Äù ‚Äúat capacity‚Äù questions need asked:

Is $30 million pre-tax?

Does still pay tax $30 million despite losing $9 million?

If answer questions yes then, depending much tax charged, lost much $9 million since $9 million would taken care tax $30 million. Good. NYC whole state lol Would bad getting 3rd moderna shot 2nd shot 7 months ago, even though 3rd dose officially approved? Fucking idiot. Someone drag out. 

If you‚Äôre field protecting someone‚Äôs health, you‚Äôre smart enough take precautions ensure you‚Äôre providing best help‚Ä¶you deserve fired. We‚Äôre feeling ton family pressure Thanksgiving Christmas year skipping last year. Really, really hoping least one shot next 5 weeks take anxiety notch.   He's Bostonian data everyone agrees data still big difference. Yeah, that's estimated timeline got too. 60% Halloween, hopefully 65% Thanksgiving.

Another thing is, John Hopkins University vaccination numbers higher 56% CDC still us 55.4 percent. like me, fear stronger overthink situation, see bad. get it, worries go away, stick around, matter assuring they're rare side effects alternative (aka risking getting covid) higher risk side effects. That's see it. Use sparingly keep Ativan handy couple weeks received doses, keep calm fears going keep night. also try reassuring using facts statistics instead medication. Whatever doctor recommends, course. would much worse costs this. Virtual learning unmitigated disaster. That's developed world (nearly Europe) kept school person.  I‚Äôll bite. What‚Äôs HCA context? I‚Äôm reading right (I‚Äôve involved vaccine development paperwork/filing/regulatory aspect, I‚Äôm honest) submission data termed ‚Äúpre-EUA activity‚Äù, per FDA guidance put forth last year mean FDA indicating requirements met, it‚Äôs they‚Äôre made aware ‚Äúpreliminary steps taken‚Äù formally request EUA. They‚Äôre likely going review data accuracy (making sure stats match, etc.) need formal EUA application make sure everything submitted meets criteria authorization. 

Source:  Hospitalization really useful metric follow age group. child &lt;2 months old fever (or even older babies unvaccinated), admit hospital 48 hours make sure there's nothing else going on, even they're totally well appearing. I've admitted lot babies like that- 6 weeks old, COVID+, eating well happy, fever keep 48 hour sepsis rule out. still sucks test urine, get chest x ray, cases spinal tap, bad might seem. vaccines pretty damn good. Uptake US been. So, people refuse part, rest us take even steps protect ourselves.


We need boosters delta anti-vaxxers. true anti-vaxxers US create Delta (anti-maskers India did). anti-vax virus-deniers culpable current situation allowed delta variant spread unchecked.    guess insulin keep diabetics alive either then. Yet still exist. 

Stupid people defending ill-acquired opinions continue prove flawed critical thinking skills every word comes mouths. farms corn fields?

The Henry Doorly Zoo consistently rated one best zoos world.  Myocarditis inflammation; long-lasting. even common issue among young men/boys COVID. still extremely rare vaccination; 1/20,000 highest rate that's seen.

But what's interesting vaccination (1) highly tied dose size, Moderna's 100 mcg dose dose causing much higher rate pfizer's 30, (2) happens second dose. opens corresponding possibilities strongly hope we're researching. giving smaller dose everyone 25? pfizer under-12 study done 10 micrograms, create larger rate 3,000 people trial 0 myocarditis incidents mean anything. likewise, happens greatly delay second dose, give young people one dose? still get good effectiveness? story report numbers scare tactic high number reason. Nothing business lead? scientist working vaccines, general scientist working something else? way qualified speak vaccines anyone else street? Delta around while, know 4 people died last month. deaths jolted scared others getting vaccinated. Sad took personal damaging impact get others vaccinated. Somebody ought start rumor social Biden administration planning release super-deadly version COVID Dec 1 wipe conservatives. Say genetically engineered Bill Gates render effective secret treatments like ivermectin useless.

Shit, that's wacky enough. Maybe say it'll turn everyone vaccinated bright blue FEMA know collect put camps they've constructing downtown San Francisco good God-fearing conservatives brainwashed leather slaves homeless minorities.

I give shit takes point. Nope. qualify quit get fired. idiots take kids pups get boosters. don‚Äôt get stupidity here. Fridays vaccines whenever delegate team. Hehehe.. Learned hard way COVID dos starting new job day after. choice, got vaccine time took whatever day/time available LOVED IT. added bonus, dead! Literally Typhoid Mary definitely think caused ease mask mandates earlier wanted. Pfizer approval expected within next couple months. time gather reliable, science-based info informed decision made doses become available. way, reason delay answer Yes. Thank working healthcare nightmare. don‚Äôt qualify unemployment, they?   seatbelt works, need airbag????? California's infection rate never reached top 20 country, total case numbers made good headlines. also location dependent. Bay Area pretty well since large tech companies immediately transitioned WFH. rural areas poorly expect, Socal somewhere between. Carrollton Bus Crash home state lot too.  watch bunch kids burn bus drunk asshole, start changing laws. Kentucky started cracking heavily duis that. Yeah, mean still get breakthrough case vaccinated benefit natural immunity + protection severe disease. get breakthrough case looks like really need natural immunity all.

It's like put every single element risk benefit separate boxes look separately instead bringing together. I'm mind controlled I'm actually quite happy cause things seem like coming together once. I'm best time grad school, I'm getting used that's cool. Thanks Pfizer. that's NYC. We're talking ENTIRE state, definitely way 5,000. WELL. YEAH. üôå Timeline went something like this: June 7 Pfizer trials started vaccines kids 5-11. Second shots ongoing early August, second shots started clock minimum 2 months clinical data order apply emergency authorization.

More info here:  would still think basic medtech program would least course biology right? far less 2% corporate employees remain unvaxxed mandated employer. asked extra time get fully vaxxed. hundred tens thousands employees actually getting fired/ quitting. It‚Äôs still science based degree.  teaching degrees?  positive thoughts keep safe?  crystals ward disease?  

- Covid cop deaths officially counted Line Duty death least sometimes. ""personal choice"" puts public risk. cannot trusted protect public say good riddance. ""The need food next day shows eating work!"".      I'm sure that. Fear pain great motivators. Many anti-vaxxers asked vaccine they're admitted hospital. late vaccine then, think they'd willing take pills point. 

Not able breathe properly terrifying. people's political convictions would go window they're ER respiratory distress offered pill fix everything. 

Of course, still public data new oral antivirals effective. need start early course infection, feel really sick, useful antivaxxers stay denial they're really sick. 8,300 still wild number think about. Thank details. Makes sense me.

Actually good point going different state. CDC vaccination database (CDC card) national state wise?

So instance 2 doses Pfizer State A. 

I go State B, say I'm unvaccinated, roll arm say "" finest Moderna please"" proceed give ID. Would pharmacy State B able trace using ID got vaccination state A? 

The whole point rigmarole mix match vaccines. Studies studies shown immune response superior get different vaccine booster (2nd 3rd). subsequent shot EXACT vaccine LESS effective immune system already recognizes it. 

Why CDC move times allow people normally? Yes fake. actual unvaxxed healthcare workers 5,000. expected knuckle replaced National Guardsmen state prepared step in.  way grew northeast TN local joke community college literally Northeast Technical Community College üíÄ u also area lmfao  Um deadline yesterday... work hospital mandate made worse made want shot  find interesting argues ""wait see"" approach vaccine due lack evidence long term safety, relying natural immunity. immunity documented evidence doubting efficacy, studied thoroughly long enough conclude safe method stopping spread staying alive. 


That flaw logic worrisome. Maybe needs stay home now. aren‚Äôt woods yet virus, even close. could people would get vaccinated, won‚Äôt. Many didn't. overlap folks regularly seek receive preventative care.

I physical week ago, doctor ran million routine tests asked ton questions screen things case.

At one point goes, ""you need tetanus shot 2 years.""

Wait Little Dicky care NBA players? imagine much better we'd right Trump told base take seriously beginning. never become partisan issue. hospital can‚Äôt manage internal vaccination program that‚Äôs poor management. live NYC, mandate applies, assure hospitals aren‚Äôt overwhelmed covid anything else right now.  reading flu earlier year measures combat Covid side-effect obliterating flu. 
The obvious reason course various social distancing practices, masking, shut-downs, etc. locally reduced flu, though know compliance varied greatly region region basis. 
But *also* almost complete moratorium international travel. universal compliance wanted go to, say, South America matter town Florida take Covid seriously. airline flights countries accepting foreigners. 
Flu ""chases winter"" migrates hemispheres multiply mutate. we've several seasonal shifts vectors enable (international travelers) exist. true?

Thanks honesty. understand nothing, ""every little bit helps."" least, time thoughts prayers, every little bit helps. also Gofundme pay funeral. Yes, yes do. Doctors vaccinated busy 24/7 hospital cases severe afford waste time go nurse get vaccine paper work keeping job. lot them, surprise you, actually vaccinated sent documents yet. Posts like propaganda makes people angry medical staff reason, nobody fired vaccinated/ get current situation stop overworking them.

Another problem narratives easily falsifiable easily mirrored.

There differences split mirroring though. one, left wants tax regulate Murdochs Zuckerbergs world. Two, science fairly clear masks vaccines, left goes consensus right cherry picks studies suit narratives. Against, consensus lies one side, see right ignore covid consensus, climate consensus well.

Either way - it'd like communication. FDA enough data? going meeting discuss data?  decide, based data population need Moderna booster, need 12 months, that's fine.  It'd nice clarity going discuss it. Thank you! Oh gosh! 100 percent agree! companies aren‚Äôt this.

I'm parent, focus reducing risks health children. already got flu shots example. There's nothing 100% keep safe forever -- we've dealt health situations broken bones, stitches, strep throat, normal part life. take precautions possible hope best. 

In words, vaccinating children reduce risk getting COVID, requiring hospitalization. That's main goal. collapse health system continue hospitals big concern event need ER (and unfortunately possible family average) there's nothing that. adults want remain unvaccinated responsible what's happening family.

As big difference make social level, ultimately going need included required vaccinations attend school. requirement see numbers go significantly enough. I've seen articles discussing employer vaccination mandates helping push people right direction expect schools similar results.

What‚Äôs rationale saying this? Pfizer one needs booster right now? Moderna gets authorization, change mind?

If you‚Äôre going previous story Moderna providing better protection, simply administered higher dosage Pfizer, dose tested 5-11 vaccine dosage Moderna testing age group well.

Ages 5-11 vaccine options yet. ‚Äúbetter‚Äù vaccines one get immediately. nurses techs refusing fall 2 camps, Antivaxx Republican.

They losing jobs believe science jobs. I'm glad responsible people's lives going forward.   October 3 days away! Giving lots covid mean nurse taking vax higher chance get patient sick. job help people get people sick. doctors vax (like 96 percent) , nurses ? anything interact patients concept transmission works. know care might spread someone else. people think infectious something filthy brown immigrants be. laugh concept herd immunity idea inconveniencing slightly people they've never met foreign anathema politics. Computer! Search ""Teeth "" ""plaque conspiracy"" .... ""Metallica."" snark. comment *you*. thousands people saw headline think Pfizer submitted approval, happened. really frustrating time-line.  say ""weeks away"" that's kind meaningless.  


Moderna submitted data Sept. 1.  believe FDA said wanted more. Moderna submitted heard anything since. job never actually cared. Mask mandate? Nah, need that. Kids obviously ill respiratory infection? They're fine, call parents send home. Staff sick/exposed? super sure? Ok, quarantine, we're going message multiple times per day results make feel like shit quarantine negative. mean need recharge EV? won‚Äôt make hundreds millions whether approved sooner approved later? feel like money bag *unless* something goes wrong trial review. don‚Äôt get right could lose competitor. feel like incentive would Pfizer actually go slower (considering still ahead competition). *""I'm wearing exact PPE I've worn whole pandemic always kept patients safe. changed?""* said.

We need judges like South Carolina. Last checked actually 6-11 least affected. Stats 0-5 slightly worse older kids.

Don‚Äôt quote this, I‚Äôm going memory. get compliance health policies, make sure threat clearly understood, even amplify it, that's takes. truth important compliance policies important. understand intent question, question enough show you‚Äôre parent.

So honest answer: parents don‚Äôt treat kids billboard political beliefs indoctrinate primal, paternal instinct protect children. don‚Äôt want kids sick, PERIOD. You‚Äôre asking ‚Äúreturning normal‚Äù, assume mean wearing masks, etc. measures simple parents feel certainly wouldn‚Äôt want get sick selfish intents don‚Äôt want wear masks anymore return normal.

With every new medical procedure, medication vaccine there‚Äôs always adverse reactions. Always. 

I think it‚Äôs odd haven‚Äôt heard those. someway could've prevented. right, go work risk lives pre-vaccine. thanked it. grateful many sacrifices. 

Now vaccine. vaccine that's shown time time effective relatively minor side effects complications. Yet healthcare refusing get vaccine. Even though would put patients direct line harm. fact turned tables. thank sacrifice pre-vaccine. However longer praise direct responsibility refuse accept.  morons.

There vaccines require boosters get vaccinated (eg tetanus).

Without vaccine, rabies 100% fatal. Rabies vaccine requires booster shots. honest. glad people want get vaccinated either quit get fired jobs. would rather crazy shenanigans later. goal early 2022 population vaccinated majority American workforce vaccinated March 2022. Healthcare workers, teachers, frontline workers either vaccinated, jobless, went jobs vaccine status affect public's health, financial debt. tired like many others Covid 19 country needs move forward persons health safety. see vaccination choice employment mandate. also see healthcare workers selfish get vaccinated, yes, foolish, consequences clear risk unemployment. going ask media give us 2 weeks unvaccinated workers getting fired stories people got hired vaccinated taking unvaccinated people's job. would like eat outside restaurant year 2022 without fearing virus could collapse lungs put lived ones ventilator love eating food someone cooked me.

I honestly don‚Äôt think vaccines &lt;5 major priority, may hard get enough data prove risks outweigh benefits need massive sample size prove benefits.

But risk always rational. People terrible measuring real world implication 1/10,000 risk versus 1/100,000 risk. even 1/1,000,000. can't it. People can't think probabilities small.

The biggest lesson whole thing public health messaging cannot rely probabilistic thinking. People good that. I've literally shown people probabilities sides people can't process it.

So perfect. Period. want damned Moderna booster approved. Maybe people claimed vaccinated go back normal life.  got 3rd Pfizer shot. Hopefully unremarkable like first two! supposed change oil? I'm Davis, students came back last week... wear mask streets! There's hope!

(/s obviously)  Hybrid immunity question - 

I've seen number reports hybrid immunity. appear looked data people first infected Covid later received vaccine. 

With breakthrough infections rampant (I know first hand; fully vaccinated along 6 coworkers got delta non-symptomatic carrier within 2 days exposure, 75% us masked socially distanced work). I'm curious peer reviewed studies emerged confirm (or show difference) hybrid immunity outcomes based reverse order (vaccinated first, infected). 

I found one study seemingly India hinted data confirming order important, results - site familiar with, looking anything reliable that, exists yet (or study underway, would love know track it).

Thanks! Nobody confirming rejecting statements based sounds. Maybe look   live sunny&amp;dry&amp;dusty climate occasionally get rain (asking S-California friend) ....  Many viruses spread via surfaces. Covid doesn‚Äôt well. Flu also doesn‚Äôt spread nearly well common cold via fomite ugh exhausting. populations would nomadic, probably didn‚Äôt live work quite close proximity many zoonotic reservoirs. development agriculture made huge difference human epidemiology. ate breakfast like 5 hours ago, I'm hungry again. Breakfast conspiracy. I'm done eating.  IMPORTANT GET SOURCE RIGHT! Sorry caps important must discover source virus came from, baseless claims.

I think follow this. Maybe need increase security labs studying dangerous virus prevent animal human transmission? Addressing problems right answer. Assuming covid entirely natural origin, says nothing potential source next pandemic. 

Virology labs increase security better understanding devastation leak could cause, even one. week 1 official booster shots. misread like did, thinking ""shit, getting million week WASHINGTON ‚Äî 400,000 Americans got Pfizer booster shots last weekend local pharmacies opening days U.S effort provide protection vulnerable populations.

The simple fact scientific evidence favor giving boosters middle-aged young, healthy adults virtually non-existent.

The evidence presented Pfizer FDA CDC consisted of:

1. 306 person, non-randomized ""trial"" historical control (i.e. everyone got booster - placebo arm), used imperfect surrogate outcome (antibody titers). think antibody titers sufficient vaccine endpoint demonstrate degree immunity, ask presence antibodies person's blood sufficient exclude vaccine mandate?

And BTW, 6 people excluded analysis received wrong booster. (Doesn't exactly inspire confidence)


2. observational study (i.e. clinical trial) Israel involved people 60, found dramatic benefit booster starting within 1 day received it, biologically plausible, demonstrating significant bias - likely selection bias based behavioral differences choose get booster not.


I think boosters dangerous, evidence beneficial many receiving them. Meanwhile, parts Africa get widespread access vaccine 2023... important, won‚Äôt?

Of course reasons.... rank file think know world-class scientists. mean, guarantees either choice, risks choice. risk/benefit analysis overwhelmingly favor vaccination, group individual. Additionally, anti-vax vax-hesitant, believe entire international scientific medical communities giant conspiracy cause extinction human race.    Honest question - vaccines 5 years old really necessary return normal? Aren‚Äôt covid deaths age range virtually nonexistent? Well shit even approved due significant issues quality control

From article, accepted vaccines approved FDA basically vaccines including Chinese ones like Sputnik V, adenovirus vaccine developed Moscow-based Gamaleya Research Institute Epidemiology Microbiology, yet approved WHO. global health agency week said suspended review process vaccine, citing concerns manufacturing practices production plants inside Russia whether vaccine consistently produced necessary standard.

H√Ä N·ªòI ‚Äî HCM City‚Äôs health department said 150,000 positive COVID-19 cases detected rapid antigen tests accounted national tally. 
 
Explaining cases granted identification number health ministry‚Äôs records, Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Vƒ©nh Ch√¢u, deputy head HCM City‚Äôs health department, Monday said protocol cases confirmed RT-PCR diagnostics officially considered positive cases. 
 
During peak outbreak HCM City, country's COVID-19 epicentre, rapid antigen tests RT-PCR tests deployed throughout city depending perceived risks area, positive cases found antigen tests considered confirmed COVID-19 patients got treated accordingly, instead waiting confirmation much time-consuming lab tests. 
 
All quarantined ‚Äì either moved centralised quarantine facilities allowed self-isolate homes conditions met, cases, local governments would bring medical packages them. 
 
The city‚Äôs health department already ""unconfirmed"" cases logs yet submitted health ministry, proposing ministry add cases national database. 
 
If 150,000 cases added national tally, Vi·ªát Nam‚Äôs official COVID-19 case count would surpass 900,000 (the country logged 766,051 infections end Monday), almost 60 per cent detected HCM City 525,000 cases. 
 
Ch√¢u said addition would also significantly bring country‚Äôs case-fatality ratio (CFR) 2 per cent, instead currently 2.5 per cent ‚Äì health ministry daily reports noted much higher global average 2.1 per cent. 
 
On Tuesday, health ministry responded HCM City‚Äôs proposal, saying August 20, special standing task force COVID-19 HCM City directed City‚Äôs COVID-19 Prevention Control Committee register positive cases found rapid antigen tests confirmed cases told self-isolate home. 
 
Confirmatory RT-PCR tests would done cases sent centralised quarantine facilities, daily figures city sends health ministry national tallying supposed include positive rapid test cases. 
 
The health ministry also told HCM City‚Äôs health department clarify exact figures, total positive rapid tests, number patients self-isolating homes number patients confirmed positive RT-PCR sent medical facilities/centralised quarantine facilities. 
 
The ministry asked HCM City's health department explanation belatedness asking guidance ministry issues case reportage.‚Äî VNS there‚Äôs place could still find free Covid coverage them, would probably here: I'd frame ""shift burden unvaccinated"". really pandemic unvaccinated now, vaccines safe effective.

Thanks providing link, done lol Near zero NY. NY contingency plan calling national guard to.

For federal employees, actually surveyed mandate (I former coworkers moved federal positions). There's generally high compliance already, taken account mandate went place.  serious experts thought masks alone would enough fight pandemic. Heck, even important factor (that would physical distance first place, *especially* symptoms) 

Not trying diss masks, one many things are/were needed. trust efficacy vaccines, medicines treatments trust? I'd think would possibly call question lot prior work. medical field, let alone working near hospital.  Jealous American best we've managed 2 years $10/test home. Woulda loved 5 tests &amp; n95 masks sent every household fuckton serial killers 70s Cali  suppose good? Someplace close zero percent. Unvaccinated Americans morons, Kaiser survey shows No, personal choice. situations. we're talking something like health care, job requires contact patients likely going immunocompromised regular basis, requiring certain vaccinations appropriate, commonplace. something new, simply adding existing list. think NYC done COVID. delta circulating widely, everything open full capacity, cases increased summer, hospitalizations fraction last year‚Äôs. long term studies effects covid either, going pick based short term vaccine group seems lot better. shame doctor's efforts wasted anti vaxxers, since lot either emigrate cost person learning without widespread vaccination among pupils generation *plagued* many sickly kids. polio bigger fear long term disabilities. It‚Äôs taking people awhile get death one possible outcome. non-surprising number HCA winners complain bad smells wear mask. Numbers per Capita?   one cares uneducated say topic know nothing about. (though small percentage) people hospitalised fully vaxxed  üòÇ probably b/c he'll afraid screw he'll ""exposed terrible vaccine"" thousands propagandists post raging staff shall stay hours even days queues get vaccinated instead saving lives, well, may protect viruses can't give brains everyone. 

Also... many actually get fired? Zero, course. turn come eventually, even thought regular people got priority... Propagating idea right unvaxxed health workers around potentially infect ineligible protection vaccine 'muh freedumbs' *big deal*. 

It get someone killed.

But hey big deal right? Yes Good conclusion  office letting voluntarily come office need break home. vaccinated required. OP saying nurse pay tripling. scenario, insurance must allowing triple costs somewhere along line. horde toilet paper.

And need Ivermectin ensure dont spread wurms!!!! [That's **Less .33%** vaccinated New Yorkers caught COVID hospitalized. Even fewer experienced major complications vaccines. quite possibly safest vaccines existence. fears based lies. Lol great analogy  Fire her, proven incompetence.  kind job dad quit, mind asking? chances enough people refuse vaccine- healthcare workers, federal govt ee‚Äôs &amp; CTRs, private companies w 100 employees more, etc.- mandates canceled? Part want demand skyrocket would prevent people getting important first shot.

Part international community glaring us taking third shot many people countries chance first. want balance protecting alienating them, especially evidence younger people strong immune systems need booster yet clear convincing. Putin played spreading much disinfo vaccines coming back full circle. Marie Curie discovering radium, see injecting it. lengths chucklefucks go smarter-than-everyone-else-edgelord astounding. Yeah everyone else's car brakes, brakes car?! /s  did, there's shit smeared windshield.  She‚Äôs got Lauren Boebert look down.  local hospital vaccine mandate flu shot, addition covid. They've flu shot mandate decade allow people apply exemptions whatever reason, medical religious. thing FDA approved Pfizer shot time around people losing shit.  Last year, flu effectively non-existant USA. Why? flu's R-value low enough non-pharmaceutical interventions use combat COVID-19 sufficient effectively END flu public health concern.  


Given COVID still issue, social distancing mask-wearing still recommended largely followed thinking humans (who really still majority) see mild flu season year.  


So that's good news. Right, he‚Äôs really smart guy. Kyrie doesn‚Äôt believe Earth globe.. play games, fire them.  heartbreaking doc. beg guy leave leaves. can't anything he's adult obviously. see comes back even worse shape dies. Maybe would've died anyway stayed we'll never know. can't imagine dealing that.  also reminded wipe ass?  Man, Pfizer certainly turned around public image since paid record breaking criminal fine barely 10 years ago. warned, given time get vaccinated. nobody blame themselves. line duty death. There‚Äôs one incident caused it. 
These officers hard job trained tasked protecting population made choice. 
That choice whether personal religious choice make personal belief system. 
Where infected unknown. Possibly wearing masks properly also. Maybe caught church. 
It private personal choice take responsibility choices. Line duty insane folks saying vaccine literally killed millions going unreported ""the mainstream media.""

Facts matter people believe them. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fact boosters exist giving even year advertised way pandemic  Children 0-4 years age 5x likely hospitalized Covid children 5-11 years age. 

Death important metric. Interesting read NY Times saying fear delta variant driving vaccinations.

Anecdotal, live one top ten lowest vax rate cities US. know several anti vax vax hesitant families someone got ill hospitalized, whole family ended getting shots. 

I didn‚Äôt realize behavior prevalent.  Either vaccines strong enough kill people don‚Äôt work im Agreed need remove logistical blocks remain. I'd also add people listen community leaders trust. example, everyone regular doctor relate to, may listen others already respect.

That said ... there's also real resistance there, numbers large enough severe, ongoing public health hazard. long keep waiting patiently, folks never get shot. That's passports mandates also necessary. No, reminded change oil rotate tires. 

Oh - remind take shit. update wipe ass not. Whoduthunk? I‚Äôm medical professional least sufficient education understand need vaccinated.

Because ""medical professional"" entail getting associates degree even certification Bumfuck Northeast Technical Community College , that

Also, order covers employees healthcare entities. Hospital workers janitors, cafeteria workers, administrative assistants, blah blah blah. healthcare professionals stretch imagination, happen work healthcare facility

Even lots nurses, lab techs, like simply associates degree, require schooling would include things like critical thinking, public health policy, forth *fuck* nonsense this?

Do words actually make sense you?

If someone lawyer twenty years mechanic twenty years banker twenty years goddamned fucking career? Exactly...they skip right natural immunity point, without mention get that. Idk seemes alot time go stores protest. fully expected get downvoted. People treat everything like cult nowadays. either need 100% team vaccination 100% team vaccinations attempt go anywhere near middle extremes look like crazy one. 

Supporting mandate pointing its' drawbacks crazy opinion news really comforting since I'm Socal, can't help worry winter. I'm hoping high 70% fully vaxxed high 80% partial vaxxed population, plus previously infected people enough prevent another severe wave here. I‚Äôve heard everything ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è we're almost 690,000 deaths.........more double then, due Delta

Thats actually true. Delta became prominent US summer. deaths US happened last winter, older COVID strain spreading still. That's saying. Word, H1N1 made believe Flue shots. I‚Äôd careful labeling reaction. Vet med clear there‚Äôs difference vaccine *reaction* vaccine *response*. Adverse reactions things like myocarditis response things like sore arms (from body‚Äôs immune response!) pedantic know helps reduce cries ‚ÄúI‚Äôve reaction!‚Äù would rather drink bleach take horse medications. Even latter inconsistent effect. folks working overtime deny killed friends family covid. Deep down, know, refusing acknowledge publicly, prevent spread info.

Example: grandma dies covid whole family says ""she died old age"", folks hear death go ""huh, wonder covid? guess wasn't, would said was.""

It's maddening.    Joey, like watching gladiator movies? Haha! Hopefully don‚Äôt meetings prepare flu booster then!

Oddly enough flu shot last year little rough me, headache really tired. also pregnant got maybe that‚Äôs I‚Äôd never flu shot give side effects before! roll dice. oh. absolutely terrifying. I'm glad everyone else thinks health care workers grow trees case. +1. Sorry got voted others. mandate great concept imo. on-the-ground reality considered timing/ implementation measures. remember vaccination schedules childhood?

Wait, *do* remember vaccination schedules childhood? vague memory going doctor often involving getting shots, certainly remember details.

For reference, [here's CDC recommended vaccine schedules shows lot multiple shot vaccines across months years. Although [the adult vaccine shows vaccines, probably relevant vaccines given children young protection young given they're bit older assuming immune system forgotten first dosing. Listening now! :)  ""the one time got flu shot, got flu next week!""    0-4 age group consistently lowest cases per capita pediatric age group currently lowest cases per capita age group, highest vaccinated group (65+). 

Despite low case numbers, 0-4 age group highest rate hospitalization children. 

Kids ages 5-11 test positive Covid 1 250 chance hospitalized (according recent CDC data). 

Kids ages 0-4 test positive Covid 1 50 chance hospitalized. 

The 0-4 age group needs vaccines 5-11 group, humble opinion. Yes. They're supposed give without ID. might harass little, set way undocumented immigrants poor they're disqualified adding viral burden.

I booster yet, announce plan next month Moderna, I'm driving different state getting ""first"". Yup, I‚Äôve getting flu shots 7-8 years none gave side effects like year‚Äôs shot. messed second Moderna shot, tbh. Here‚Äôs hoping last booster anyone needs. Doesn‚Äôt matter ya are, one wants get booster shot every months. Covid vaccine de-worms horse real good. point children already low risk Covid, worth vaccinating like countries give flu chicken pox vaccines.

From perspective sounds insane we've always given flu chicken pox vaccines kids least long I've parent. non-controversial here. far COVID concerned, know kids gotten rough time think accurate say they're ""such low risk"" personally know kids reduced 70% lung capacity another spent weeks hospital spring still gets headaches (both student athletes UK's vaccination committee recommend 12-18 year olds get vaccinated

I live U.K. really like can't say investigated justification whole pandemic protecting health system.

The health system exist vacuum. agree critical, point healthcare system actually help individuals health never protecting yourself, children parents, since part majority recover.

I lost two grandparents COVID, can't take cold, calculating stance it. many people lost loved ones, death toll surpassed 1918 flu U.S., we're trying save lives prevent chronic illnesses what's benefit small face overwhelming hospitalisations adults.

I like either, adults *want* this. they're struggling make time get shots they're victims conspiracy creating vaccine shortage. shots plentiful U.S. we're nation donating vaccines around world yet we're still throwing away response still seems individualistic. ""Oh well family vaccinated, we're fine."" pretty irrelevant since individual level, always relatively safe.

What choice have? live society federal government slow moving trying get people vaccinated, state government making hard get people vaccinated also opposing mask requirements, social distancing, etc. local government pretty ineffective state sabotaging whenever try something help situation. top that, significant loud minority people refuse vaccinated, becoming physically violent anyone wants take sort precautions. completely pandemic time.

Perhaps better way state would live society anymore, live America many people delusional unwilling even protect lives COVID much less others. irony wife dual citizens countries, we're thinking really hard going somewhere feel like everything falling apart part community unified public health sorts things. America we're sitting ducks COVID whole host things tiring. arrogance

I understand seeming way, you‚Äôll forgive - comparison deadbeat father originally abandoned sister diagnosis - yeah, im bit arrogant thinking better job parenting actual father. also didn‚Äôt realize primal parenting instincts happen kid actually came loins, im pretty sure adoptive parents would disagree approach disingenuously omniscient &amp; offputting

Perhaps was, it‚Äôs hard jump specific assumptions conclusions initial responses posed ‚Äúdoes vaccinated young kids matter go back normal life‚Äù ‚Äúso you‚Äôre parent either?‚Äù. Especially Reddit particular thread you‚Äôre never exactly sure you‚Äôre dealing angle they‚Äôre coming from, it‚Äôs opinion valid approach discourse resort specific assumptions defensiveness questions posed way lack context come attempt strawmanning whataboutism.

With applications complex, nigh impossible submit completed application without least degree review going advance. review likely going even speak. 

Keep mind, extremely data intensive applications. Especially stage, reviews raw data mostly look incompleteness, malfeasance, confirm presented data. Based experience FDA submissions(which admittedly limited), FDA go presented data, reviewing results, informing Pfizer presented data needs detail, requesting additional presented data answer specific questions, etc. 

If 12-15 year old timeframe indicator, submit formal application next week. live another part state family came stay us SF last year. lax everything, *very* different attitude distancing, masking, etc. first wave early 2020 really fucked up. much death job loss quickly really got people talking seriously another level. Really hope happens soonish, everyone house finally vaccinated relax worry little less niece going school. anti-vax nurse probably last person want around helping make medical decisions. Eh. Flu shots try target different strains. Tetanus shot would better example. get several doses time, 1 every 10 years. Much like family, lost. can't say anything change minds. I've tried I'm done. you, friend. Everyone different, got flu shot week ago bit sore arm. workplace (a research hospital) started giving Pfizer boosters well, got yesterday. pretty sore arm side effects. giving flu Covid boosters people time, glad two sore arms. Early data cases myocarditis/pericarditis last thing need common enough deter people.

This one cases ounce prevention worth truckload public messaging overcome unnecessary fear. knew it. Kept telling celebratory antivaxxers would make past week. know voted. 266 stillbirths year would amazingly low number. average 24,000 stillbirths year - 1 every 160 births per CDC. may lost poor prenatal care, many lost due birth complications cord accidents. cases, explanation loss found. tragedy many people know about. 

I lost first daughter cord accident 2 days due date. would 10 now. absolutely text book pregnancy her. great health care, careful ate drank, smoke, gain huge amount weight, blood pressure great, gestational diabetes. perfect. turned cord twisted. happened, oxygen supply cut off. 

My heart goes families lost babies... hell never goes away. thoughts pregnant women there. can't imagine pregnant pandemic dealing worry must bring. Please get vaccinated wear mask sake baby's. 

[CDC stillbirth  wonder story ends... Nurses getting vaccine mind boggling me. can't medical professionals following regulations understanding important get vaccine, especially work field crucial this, need expelled flunked profession schooling. topic wish would find heartworm vaccine animals. Ivermectin cause liver issues problems senior dogs. make choice stop giving 13yo dog started health problems. people wait last minute. I'd guess maybe 10% number actually let go. ‚ÄúIf real pandemic wouldn‚Äôt firing nurses.‚Äù 

Uh, yeah, would. need people believe science medicine take care sick people. I‚Äôm hearing reports hospital systems granting basically every religious exemption request claiming system compliant ‚Ä¶ talking close double digits percentage employees granted religious exemption. Hospitals trying keep lid won‚Äôt release numbers exempted media. Fucking infuriating. getting week drive thru clinic along younger siblings. it‚Äôll done first.

And 3 year old well 10m old. eager final phase shots well.  needed this. Thank you. That‚Äôs said. 

But yeah agree told brother that. it‚Äôs thought needle freaks people out, actual needle [doesn‚Äôt look bad   like one more, actually! Bad faith Yeah job market super hot right now, quit, also find place complying mandate small enough anything. 

I would surprised testing/vax mandate *significant* impact labor, supply chains, etc. end feeling. again, knows. Maybe we'll recession OSHA hands word people feel good quitting little poke arm. yet. trying look work keeps getting busy today me. maybe services like labs, scans, etc...are delayed covid-19 patients using services. 92% NYS nurses vaccinated. 95% NYC. Higher rates doctors. Good riddance tiny minority assholes. lead increase suicides addressed. 

It's rather shocking country seems ""post pandemic"" plan... like going clean mess caused covid. 

Not people long covid, damage done people's financial state, psychological state, physical state (non-covid diseases gone unattended many people). 

It's like think world get back normal. take off. buy JJ stock. That's awesome. aware second age group testing going currently. 17 month old we're anxiously waiting get vaccinated childhood asthma feel like sooner get something onboard better. idea. saw morning, looking cigarette smoke reducing ACE2 expression, looking medications would achieve similar effects. Yes I'm hearing nurses refusing vaccine NYS. ""I need wait YEARS see happens."" find another profession. get work around sick people refuse minimize risk spreading life-threatening virus them. vaccination requirement mandated state, NBA. exemption would need approved state. Believe NBA said wouldn‚Äôt seek exemption state behalf Wiggins. parent require donation egg sperm. Yes, metric thread comments ongoing deaths per capita. excellent points. fully agree. 

I think currently struggling knowing decisions I‚Äôve made (for example- people I‚Äôve voted for) contributing suffering people live care about. 

That said, decisions they‚Äôre making hurting everyone else. fully understand well. 

This sure ‚Äúme‚Äù problem- coping emotional fallout I‚Äôm perceiving fault, even though casualties caused worldwide crisis none us asked for.

Thx response.  I've worked state federal prisons 18 years. got hard treat staph infection hand touching table 2006. Since then, I've pretty much washed like surgeon going getting out. amount communicable diseases places joke. still released data number infections vaccine group placebo group. study designed measure this, definitely addition, efficacy confirmed COVID-19 asymptomatic infection also That's honourable you. mean sincerely. found response general reeked arrogance, assuming guy asking simple question parent, go expert primal parental instincts, say biological parent. response unnecessarily aggressive, perspective. didnt bring politics interest to, one attempting again, making pretty broad assumptions now. know, likely viewpoints you, find approach disengenuously omniscient &amp; offputting. Might worth self reflecting that. best neice. getting flu shot too?

Also I'm boat, 5 year old daughter waiting vaccine. Also 3yo waiting bit longer  Oh, like that. Although, part trying tie sort way see world. Tesla Model 3 city dweller piece crap can‚Äôt Real Work‚Ñ¢.

Stupid people say stupid things though Yes. wife planning get week we‚Äôre weeks apart. happy 6 year old get vaccinated soonish, especially since school, also 2 year old I'd like get vaccinated returning normal. sounds like close behind, good news. Yeah ends case, we'll go Pfizer something better nothing sooner get something better.

I wish clear cut answer ""Yeap, best one getting approvals needed get everyone."" course nothing simple voicing hopes opinion vaccines. Understood, looked stand corrected: Moderna actually testing age range significantly higher dose Pfizer tested. Moderna testing two parts, Part 1 participants ages two years less 12 years receiving one two dose levels (50 Œºg 100 Œºg). Ages six months less 2 years may receive one three dose levels (25 Œºg, 50 Œºg 100 Œºg). 

Pfizer tested 10 Oh Romania sold many doses countries instead promoting vaccine? Tough luck.

They escaped delta summer luck run out. Yeah, would really one night partying back work week. It'll three here! Nurses apply bottom-line conclusions. They're trained rigorous scientific thinking doctorates. However, years executing bottom-line conclusions lead tell they're practicing medicine they're basically doctors. 

This makes nurses vulnerable misinformation. instance, there's publication right serum vitamin levels supposedly correlating almost protective effect death covid infection. Someone who's used taking conclusions running might take ""finding"" like think supplementing vit ""natural"" way protect death without vaccine. Spoiler though, author's conclusion unfounded correlation statistically significant, mention even finding repeated. still helping fuel millions people reject vaccine think they're practically smart doctors they're ""doing research"" find (pre-)publication author unfounded conclusion. 

So nurses medical support staff, people mistakenly think trusted give medical advice, citing poor conclusions bad science. honestly know better. Neither people they're spreading BS to. 

This misinformation clusterfuck. took vaccine dummy, read post? Well course Warriors fans shitting him, know well anybody he's worth amount headache production:salary ratio. Yeah, truly mind-blowing changing circumstances led new judgments That's sweet. üíï   ""The FDA takes seriously importance getting vaccines, shown safe effective children,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, nation's leading infectious disease expert, told MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" show. ""I would imagine next weeks examine data **hopefully give O.K. start vaccinating children hopefully end October**.""

Is feel like dates keep getting pushed back? Earlier year seemed hopeful we'd time school started, FDA punted back July. kept hearing September, end September Pfizer sending information asking approval yet (and probably seek EUA October given date today.) constant source stress U.S. government taking long something slam dunk point.  Don‚Äôt forget everyone works health care health professional.

Surprised mandates work, think there's this.  someone truly believes vaccines hurt them, spend small fraction $22m locked proper education teach they're incredibly fucking stupid Sadly, people anti-vaccine already shown lie type thing. 

If says it, good. needs get antibody test show still antibodies. comes back showing does, personally I'm ok going back work. 

That said, science comes learn continues evolve, I'm also ok hospitals point saying vaccines requirement. turns vaccines better long term protection, makes sense safety patients say vaccines mandatory.

FWIW, good news NBA's percentage total vaccinated players actually pretty high. see official numbers, CJ McCollum tweeted 90% league vaccinated. Personally, hope give superstars pass simply are. Wiggins Towns teammates, since COVID Doctor annual check-up recently baby vaccinated. nurse telling lost 3 babies last week main hospital due Mother's Covid. sad! wish people would get vaccination already - especially pregnant women.

When pregnant, vaccine still approved pregnancy. WISH able get pregnancy son could antibodies.

Here's hoping like what's side. surveys shown many unvaccinated people vehicles work hours makes difficult get vaccinated. places good job providing shots people like that, whether free shots .wet are, pay transportation costs, good enough job letting people know programs exist. Also, lack 2-3 days universal PTO per shot even contract workers needed people get paid days they'll miss. Also, places tried direct payments, even $100 payment enough motivate large uptick vaccination, especially among young people apathetic, anti-vax. 3 days PTO least $150 full time workers, could easily full stimulus check dependent vaccinated. 

Mandates thing work firing people complying causes issues. much cheaper pay people $1000 shot cover cost hiring training new employees, prison stays switch black market avoid mandate, dealing people radicalized result start commit direct violence (not bioviolence). lot troubles Iraq caused US people trained violence (military) longer job, went found similar job opposing threw poverty without anything help them. something think implementing mandates cops military even trying provide serious incentives without providing legitimate alternatives. $30 million pre-tax

Thats huge gap. lf 1 3 people developed long covid think would already know it. Im talking even mild symptoms like lack taste, bit brain fog, etc.

Also, read article control group got infected flu common cold found 50% difference. mean? 1% people infected influenza lingering symptoms, 1+0.5*1=1.5% people covid lingering symptoms?

If 30% number real, vaccines halving chance long covid, leaves us 15% people lingering symptoms breakthrough case. that's case surely go back normal yet. really dont trust 30% number much. African American skeptical vaccines?"
