Covid left unable walk short distance without needing stop air.

Fuck covid. I'm third world country too, USA.

Sad, nation shithole 2nd shots BC booking 7-8 weeks first. mine middle
Of May get invite second July 3rd almost there's reason women tend live longer.... side effects vaccine, many symptoms actual covid too, caused *by* immune system (not virus). Covid case ‚Äústrong immune system‚Äù liability. ‚Äústrong immune system‚Äù unleashed full strength fragile lung tissue straight kill you, even virus wasn‚Äôt really causing much cellular damage. (this virus indeed cause cell damage too, point is, immune system‚Äôs reaction actually part problem) midwest low thirties county think. good. healthcare paid already two Americas. One dies faster other. happen know is?

I'm curious! Get vaccine. Buy masks sewn nose wires pockets fit disposable filters. wear glasses zero problems fogging. would great AMA could AMA here.  I'm sorry loss friend. Lost cousin around time. lungs. It‚Äôs shame don‚Äôt better vaccine protection respiratory infections. would great eradicate RSV along viral meningitis, measles pertussis. Respiratory pathogens underrated scourge society (said chronic sinusitis sufferer, parent walking Petri dishes/children. people, brain rewire around lost area. unfortunately brain good regenerating all. Yes, hospitals treat anyone something (or neglected something) caused illness. Good idea. Probably dumb-shit ""shedding"" theory vaccines. thinking guy penile transplant. picking sinovac Pfizer pick Pfizer day. Indonesia ordered 50 million jabs Pfizer arrive August. waited Pfizer arrive country also. getting Pfizer shot hours now. links news talks this? sounds like happening time even news! lots examples stuff, right? share examples nah?

I want believe man weird proof thing that's supposedly happening everywhere regularly covered news. Weird. want live destroyed country? telling possible explain something without condescending douche? Wtf  listening models instead scientists? ü§î  Honestly blows mind many people still actively resisting vaccine

A lot people trust medical industrial complex federal government. Yep, probably similar. go physical occupational therapy. took month could walk bathroom. question would number optimally be, referring people saying vaccination rates ""low"" I'm asking number would satisfy point pandemic? real tho always part America. easily apparent chapters history. Comments saying ""it's apparent since... XYZ"" basically people saying ""understanding racial class politics America starts at.... XYZ."" messaging Australian government regarding AZ vaccine terrifyingly atrocious. vaccine supposed home production advantage demonised left, right centre Australian society. takes cake clearly messaging continue second dose. people want ""wait Pfizer"", open eligibility Australians who'd rather get AZ wait. Fiji could also used vaccines combat outbreak Australians want it. Called reading news bro. takes time. Plus, U.S. sending LOT vaccinations countries around world disproportionately affected. 

I posed initial question saw post one praised Germany passing 50% first dose. scrutinizing every one healthy adults vaccinated well? It‚Äôs ‚ÄúAmerican Exceptionalism‚Äù story told growing became national identity. won‚Äôt ‚Äúhappen us‚Äù ‚Äúwe live greatest country world‚Äù ‚Äúmy individual rights enshrined constitution‚Äù. Complete utter nonsense hurts us. know heart aches family historical program historically low rates approving claims doling payouts.

As last month, Fauci reported 60% CDC employees similarly 60% FDA employees vaccinated. sure rate now, month later, rates correlate state, 60% 72% eligible residents.

Considering 1-3% population legitimate medical reason refuse vaccine, consider still sizable population general public hesitant one reason another. since appears track FDA employees CDC employees, must consider possibility hesitant may legitimate reasons hold taking risk ‚Äî least now. assume everyone hesitant simply uneducated redneck plague rat ill informed assume FDA CDC employees, find unreasonable assumption, though admit perhaps argument could made others. 

If want diminish hesitancy raise vaccination rates, must humor notion even circles like CDC FDA, sizable proportion people one reason another aren‚Äôt quite ready take risk themselves, try honestly empathize understand hesitation resides society come together help mitigate risk assuage concerns.

As mentioned, work healthcare, know ton frontline healthcare workers. small office, 4 5 coworkers already gotten covid last year recovered. moderna vaccine made available us January, took shots. 3 4 coworkers recovered covid took vaccine did. 1 never confirmed covid took well. 1 holdout office still jabbed reasoning already natural immunity, vaccine wouldn‚Äôt offer enough benefit take risk suffering potential vaccine side effect. always comes back question: gets seriously ill dies vaccine, cover medical bills? single mom, dies vaccine side effect, care child?  already looked potential insurance coverage history government payouts low rate payout encouraging enough inspire take risk getting vaccine virus already natural immunity protection from.

For coworker, threat denying health coverage covid hospitalization rings hollow natural immunity (confirmed antibody test results? It‚Äôs simply non-issue nothing move needle her. MIGHT move needle bear risk vaccination unwavering assurance hospitalized vaccine side effect, someone cover hospital bills. one willing grant assurance, sees reason take risk liability own.

Bear mind seen two instances patients experienced severe side effects taking vaccine. high percentage, something seen literally eyes. One two literally almost died revived wife followed instructions phone preform life saving procedures waiting ambulance arrive. couple always continues even take pro-vaccine position general public, husband decided (with wife‚Äôs urging) skip second shot. 

You can‚Äôt tell coworker‚Äôs fear unfounded witnessed (admittedly rare) risk vaccination played front eyes, knowing full well health care worker ineligible insurance coverage must navigate labyrinthal halls government bureaucracy seek compensation vaccine injuries exactly guaranteed point time. Especially experiencing covid knowing mild personally, well witnessing majority coworkers well patients recover covid mild symptoms (we haven‚Äôt personally seen patients die suffer severe effects, us experienced cold/flu like symptoms. lost sense smell taste 45 days). Telling won‚Äôt eligible covid-related health insurance coverage won‚Äôt convince get vaccinated. offering protection support potential risks vaccination might.

That‚Äôs anecdote, I‚Äôm sure many like coworkers already recovered covid see little serious reinfection won‚Äôt moved vaccinate basis denying future covid related health coverage. could explain high rate vaccine hesitancy health care workers first responders, probably higher rate previous infection natural immunity non health care workers worked home year lower levels exposure infection. might explain even people working FDA CDC tracking general trends vaccination prevalence hesitancy. accept people first hand knowledge covid see lower personal risk potential risk getting vaccinated, way get take shot mitigate potential risk vaccination equal lower risk catching covid (again).

Honestly, harm running campaign widely publicize people don‚Äôt worry much even rarer side effects, least monetary aspect it, covered coverage priority unequivocal, streamlined, guaranteed? don‚Äôt see anyone would oppose tack.

There ways encourage vaccine uptake hesitant shaming, coercing, punishing, demeaning. also offer support protection guarantees. Let‚Äôs show hesitant care understand concerns willing able protect vaccinate protect others. Always taking purely negative punishing tack breed distrust, hate, societal level resentment. coworker convinced punishing tactic removing covid protections unvaccinated, policy could lead think policy makers hyper focused vaccination rates don‚Äôt value lives anyone unvaccinated all. may lead distrust hyper focused vaccination campaigns get vaxxed all. think less theory group scenarios ranging possible unlikely basically discredited (i.e. bioengineered weapon). People quick dismiss Trump pushed political purposes. Broken clocks still right occasion though - recent chatter hasn‚Äôt enough effort devoting truly studying (and likely ruling out). Bad generalization. CureVac's vaccine mRNA showed low efficacy trials. Nobody ever able say straight face ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know.‚Äù

With regard ovary stuff, actually look Japanese bio-distribution data, actually shows less tenth 1 percent vaccine ends ovaries. course, don‚Äôt mention podcast. Also, rodents injected dose 500x human receives get vaccinated.

As Robert Malone, actually listened interview several months ago legit background he‚Äôs smart guy, based tangential comments made, kinda sounded like he‚Äôs disgruntled professional (I think said lost job something one point) bit chip shoulder. look up, hasn‚Äôt really involved anything important affiliated mainstream institution past 15-20 years. 

And guy Steve nuts. 100% I‚Äôm surprised see people aren‚Äôt actually talking this.  released vaccines made Canadian funding? sent IHME model. It‚Äôs bad model since beginning pandemic.

CFR COVID wild-type public health experts since put COVID-19 death rate 0.6% -- six times typical flu variants higher. province (BC, point) also slow reopening starting limited indoor dining (4 weeks ago) last week expanded capacity inter-regional travel. next weekend masks optional almost back normal, continue downward trend.

The vaccines absolutely mitigate health effects covid. It‚Äôs harder quantify symptomatic/symptomatic/hospitalized/dead.

What specific precautions think average vaccinated person going willing take Fall avoid things? Almost every Major democratic city going full charter schools.  Chicago destroyed public schools. I'm sorry practicality interfering fearmongering. father refused today Father‚Äôs Day went ER bad cough diagnosed Covid-19. wouldn‚Äôt listen tried convince him.  husband said morning wished could slip drinking water, least beer. citizen USA, we'll boycott qualifying Would asshole suggesting might helpful COVID fatal? Like you‚Äôre actively helping out, one‚Äôs decent friends/family/neighbors would one‚Äôs case indecent ones support ill-begotten opinion dying. 

Kind like handle folks bitten zombies, except notches old extremity dial. problem ignoring already said - ""most"". Best luck. Well play European countries ATM repeat mistakes guys. health officials said Pfizer vaccine, 5.4 million Israelis inoculated, appears highly effective Delta variant, particular, stopping severe Pfizer vaccine least 88% effective symptomatic disease variant two weeks second dose, compared 93% effectiveness British variant 95% original strain, study published Public Health England such, latest outbreaks ‚Äútell us future going look like,‚Äù Leshem said. ‚ÄúPeople unvaccinated get infected, people fully vaccinated could get infected protected severe 90% Israelis age 50 inoculated, ‚Äúthese outbreaks pose risk public health,‚Äù said.
Segal said: ‚ÄúSo, think follow developments, otherwise, business noted among people infected recent outbreaks, many one-third vaccinated, according Cyrille Cohen, head immunotherapy laboratory Bar-Ilan such, country consider taking additional steps protect Israel new coronavirus wave, said.  Same. Snake handling churches tolerate zero eccentricity. Nothing mental gymnastics hold onto clearly false belief. damn right fit in! told lab China tens thousands workers go every day regular contact animals, waste, corpses? Even worse, absolutely protective equipment, animal handling protocols, health screens employees, absolutely plan place event outbreak. Also, animals segregated viruses regularly jump species species, often without anyone noticing. 

Do think COVID would likely originate lab, lab Wuhan? has. always looked large chunk Americans awful people right core. Always wondered wound damn many them. awful chunk getting noisy. stating thought that, saying people believe conspiracy matter much evidence refutes it. think God didnt create viruses? 250k new cases day around last winters peak, saying Delta variant peak 50k cases day? 

If so, thats frightening expecting. Thats around April. According deaths vs average lot people died even though auto accidents suicides way 88% efficacy rate means still significant infections small percentage vaccinated people. understand works, can't actually discussion.

What actually hampers discussion reductive. ""Cases"" mean much anything anymore, since infections vaccinated people often mild non-lasting. even cases meaningful, they're spiking. personally affects Wer called English variant here... Kent used UK India requires negative covid test leave country. companies processing tests faking results.  Actually patient zero found yes, stemmed That's true, *would been* great concept tried put top existing now-year-old naming convention. I'm saying good, missed boat... lot. mean, *technically...* 


Balls-old hyper-compressed biomatter, anyhow. Completely understand coming from, precautions make perfect sense given stipulations relaxing. Best luck coming year! can‚Äôt let them? keep treating like toddlers don‚Äôt want eat vegetables?

If people certain regions don‚Äôt want vaccine, fine. maybe rest us let chickens come home roost stop bending backwards help interest helping themselves. Fucking F bit late pandemic...but glasses fogging seal mask job. Find better fitting mask...you know next pandemic, guess. like third.

And much evil, least entirely. There's lot mental illness country. People raised (or abandoned by) incredibly shitty parents. people grow shitty values empathy. self-esteem low way feel good demonize anyone look like think like them. miserable group people.

Also, great many deeply stupid. Here's hoping highest IQ member group. Applied Barrington strategy. like Sweden tried spring 2020. Yep Think savings rest us non-fat humans would medical care true. Buffet lobby would revolt though. practicing Catholic, fucking understand people claim followers Christ, spent goddamned time making sure society's least favorite people happy, comfortable, nourished regardless literally anything including ""sin"" (and definitely regardless much money made - know, poor America sin, may well be). Swear God, closer get Jesus want throw whole religion trash, can't tolerate associating people. close becoming priest spend life yelling Christians. referring something specific? raised zero effect person staying fat adulthood. Genetics also mean nothing, everyone stay healthy BMI try. may work harder others, that's excuse it. 

The real excuse things medical conditions cause obesity regardless person's choices, Prader-Willi syndrome, Cushing syndrome, etc. 

Everything else choice, medically prove made choice didnt due specific diseases. Acs make things even worse circulate air already room. exchange air one outside. projecting lot motives. declined vaccine back January 2021. still scarce commodity time. may declined thought someone else needed did. 2 Americas. One cares health wellbeing others wants everyone flourish, stuck old ways letting people die live narcissistic lives. question one want live in?

Hint: right answer. would expect given populations higher risk mutations happening outside USA vs within due large number countries w/o adequate vaccine supply. USA 4% global population, decent percentage already vaccinated vs large part 96% planet yet doses weaker vaccine unlike Pfizer/Moderna. rest world mostly open international travel still mostly closed/quarantined borders? feel sad people. History probably call age stupidity told 2008 Tea Party would react Obama 8 years electing crazy conspiracy mad man President try overthrow government, would believe you.  think denied advanced treatment, least wait behind everyone else get it. obese person refused stop eating much eat healthier needs kidney transplant, go directly back line. Let dialysis 10+ years first. None go ahead people got sick due fault own. wrong you? logic makes sense. flu every year kills predictable amount people yearly. Covid killed 3.8m worldwide 600k US alone. fucking flu even remotely comparable.

Your gun comparison would make sense flu firing AR15 crowd, Covid-19 firing 30mm autocannon A-10 warthog crowd. new variant every year need got new boost shot every year, Oh No! Holy crap Can‚Äôt watch link right now, seeing said specifically mentioned 20-29, say anything significant increase children well? kind impairment uncommon critically ill ICU patients regardless illness have. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily related covid specifically.  came hospital spent week intensive care, week normal ward spent 10 hours surgery, also 2 CT scans, several xrays etc.

I hate think much would cost lived US. I'd probably going bankrupt I'd injured there. sorry mom. know watch mom passing. went thru mom. prayers you. Lost mom 2016. covid rate surge England bad though...looking graphs worldometers all. It‚Äôs great concept makes far easier track timeline variants. Previously zero fucking clue variant popped first. doesn‚Äôt matter it‚Äôs matter from. Stay strong, feel guilty things control over. amount people usa covid amount people vaccinated..we good I've moved virus..are y'all going quarantine variant surpasses vaccine defense? *Anyone* eligible vaccinated Covid public safety threat.

Early studies (and ongoing) suggest AZ prime followed Pfizer booster optimal setup. Better AZ-AZ Pfizer-Pfizer. results clear enough make anyone's optimal strategy.

And even optimal, requires countries large supplies both, many do. help Australia's situation, instance. rest world.

The kind vaccine snobbery demonstrated link probably (almost certainly) going cause problems discrepancy efficacy ever would. terms lengthening pandemic aggregate healthcare outcomes. still left want vaccine gotten yet similar amount firm no. I'm assuming yes people point either procrastinating limited access vaccines. there's still left there. component critical thinking asking 'problemetizing' questions. case, one gain advocating lockdowns? thing think feeling safety. Rightly wrongly. 

Contrary, anti-lockdown folks interesting. feeling 'normal' again, good number financial interest returning business usual.

So situation powerful people prefer opening vulnerable people prefer closing. (Broadly, exceptions both). Interestingly skeptics also happen dedicated communities favor social media algorithm....


So now, experts believe things much safer, 2 camps. Nervous folks think powerful people rigging things, folks desperate discredit folks suggesting financially harmful actions.

Often, got justification someone actually evil misinformed power profit.  Also, long least reporting shots given, rate accurate.

I‚Äôve heard lot anecdotes people surrounding states came Cali get vaccinated difficult getting shots states. I‚Äôve even heard people countries, like Canada Mexico, same. Supposedly necessary show ID (though show ID got vaxxed)

Not sure prevalent is, wonder also affected reporting rates Cali. Maybe skewed numbers higher actually is? even reliable tracking data it‚Äôs true ID proof California residency required?

Tenpenny Bigtree seem likely. that's source calculate death rate used entire global population denominator. honestly think every last person Earth already infected covid-19? mean care vaccine catch all.

""Extremely minimal"" overstating it. great vaccines. doubt it. trust them, say dangerous variants, potentially growing caseloads fall, waning immunity risk ""extremely minimal"" wrong. We're talking semantics here. risk low, still encourage many people get vaccinated possible. Hopefully retain level effectiveness. Reports stage 2 trials seemed indicate one highest performing vaccines. I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm going need published evidence around safety dna vaccine use humans. technology approved veterinary use.

Fool, think homework you. curiosity, say look status?

Is like data available presumed unvaccinated, processing, something else?

Just curious. don‚Äôt answer don‚Äôt want. cares freedom? Look America free 3x many people dead god knows many people injured. Freedom ass.  60 case. know 99% - something like 99.3% I've seen. invert look death rates, 0.7% different 0.03% (over 20 times larger). get always seems exactly 99.97% quote. Unlike believable 0.7%, always figure, never quote range never gets adjusted evidence.

I'm interested source figure, whether misinterpreted particular study statistic, whether someone made rest latched onto it. Considering News York city already six times amount total population already died, I‚Äôm gonna call massive bullshit comment. 0.63% NYC‚Äôs population already died. everyone immune exact second (which totally incorrect) would huge amount, since we‚Äôre 100% immunity, you‚Äôre ***massive*** amount.  wouldn‚Äôt worry masks outdoors, unless you‚Äôre squeezed together like sardines can. Air circulation seems key factor, can‚Äôt get better air circulation outdoors. You‚Äôre right that. work administrative position health clinic one jobs process insurance claims. indeed try hard pay out, even know they‚Äôre liable, make process difficult possible, requiring excessive documentation excessive time labor process claims. insurance companies better others, absolutely terrible. I‚Äôve sat phone hold literally hours certain insurance companies (ahem, MetLife) trying process claims know need pay out, definitely see possibility people simply giving frustrating hanging simply don‚Äôt time energy patience chase compensation.

In case, public well political leaders demand solution this. Either streamline process like require insurance companies cover covid testing vaccine intake, government step circumvent insurance companies fund hospital bills people injured vaccines.

It makes sense government able make easily freely cover people get tested covid frequently desire, freely easily cover people getting vaccinated, reason, vaccine related injuries covered difficult seek compensation for.

It fueling hesitancy suppressing vaccination rates. nobody talking it, even push everyone vaccinate ad nauseam. hope remove degree hesitancy refuse address one reasons people hesitant? Adelaide plant already approved manufacturing biological medicinal products, looking federal funding reconfigure able produce mRNA vaccines. vaccine develops slightest problems later on, everyone going them. 

That's completely untrue. stupid even control group know really vaccine.

There control groups planet. participating one giant control group entire world, guess results in. Long term effects mrna vaccine isn‚Äôt novel new people seem think first demonstrated 1989‚Ä¶mRNA vaccines weren‚Äôt invented combat covid19. people longer friends group. Ok get it. Jesus Christ. It‚Äôs even relevant information question ‚ÄúWhat wrong him.‚Äù .... ‚ÄúHe irreparable lung damage.‚Äù ‚ÄúDID KNOW WOULD FINANCIALLY RUINED US!!!!‚Äù.... Yes dude, know now. think info would really usfull

It's not. number vaccinated people catch covid low hard measure. long significant amount people get vaccinated (20-30%) chance it'll mutate render vaccines useless?

Asking really understand UK chance? infectious disease epidemiologist agree!!!! experience &amp; much successful science broken pattern recognition. beauty modern science longer knowledge-limited imagination-limited; google answer question empirical knowledge long ask right. However, creative applications &amp; creative questions yield exciting answers. Edward Frenkel discusses 2018 Einstein lecture ""creativity privilege child - one afraid wrong repeatedly"" (he quotes it, idk original person). jargon communicate - real gold creativity, putting together interesting ideas create something new!

My thoughts mABs: Antibodies specific single target nature, think that's issue COVID. I'll take IL-6 antibodies (tocilizumab et. al.) example. IL-6 one many cytokines influence inflammation across body. Toci targets one cytokine, ignoring everything else (other interleukins, TNFa, etc.). Imagine dam breaks, use flex tape patch one 30 holes. enough, that's data shows well; there's statistical significance get thousands patients, 1-2% benefit.

I'm PhD tissue engineering &amp; regenerative medicine Stanford, I've published undergrad &amp; multiple fields including drug delivery, inflammation &amp; neonatology, cancer biology, biomaterials, gut bioengineering, astrochemistry. Part reason publish often &amp; across disciplines lot hobbies science side projects end turning cool papers LOL. example, astrochemistry paper &amp; one cancer papers side projects &amp; come really well! free time, work biotech venture &amp; consult biopharma startups. Recently I've gotten interested math though - lot best ideas come fields, realized know little open problems &amp; concepts math I've learning see repurpose ideas.

Happy pm answer questions! sorry response delay LOL area California similar, believe. kinda feel opposite. think continuing live like it‚Äôs April 2020 shows lack confidence vaccines, tinge anti-vax nonsense me. Honestly I'm pleasantly surprised simple ""yes"" top rated comment really, nothing necessary. US given 300 million doses. US big country. Considerably larger Canada. want compare ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù compare state comparable size‚Äîsay, California, lifting restrictions high amount people fully vaccinated. US months ahead Canada every metric, recognize diversity United States far greater Canada. Canada general much homogenous population. It‚Äôs primarily concentrated three cities. Might well California. 

Anyway, know US months ahead less restrictions (no mask order) cases continue decrease. It‚Äôs States July 4th. won‚Äôt Canada September. hope lift mask mandates then. Maybe not, Canadians cautious given socialist mentality (overall). could tell denial CDC revised mask ordinance. One experts oppose change. He‚Äôs getting way.  got mine local Walgreens, I've heard reporting big pharmacies like CVS inconsistent. idea that's received shots, fact shots even administered.... long least reporting shots given, rate accurate.

Really sure point. RIP. wish family eventually find peace brave departure. one point 99.97% population died covid, leading argument ""why let everyone catch it"". that's 99.7% guess that's number came from.

Afterwards main symptom six weeks exhaustion, plus couple days coughing alarming pink stuff. covid *did* also affect senses smell taste. Eventually came back, nothing seems particularly weird muted now, honest know I'll ever know certain level got sick. can't remember different back then.

With exception stint feverish drifting consciousness first day, seem affect head all... least think? never got brain fog, anosmia good sign brain, it? I'm thinking may may developed slight tinnitus? definitely little bit now, surprised previously honestly I'm sure.

I think one big fears uh. reduced mental acuity? sure whether would scary aware losing sharpness happening (a la Flowers Algernon), lose aware it. I'm kind terrified covid may done latter thing me, knocking pegs without knowledge. Maybe consult family see think I've gotten duller. Irony confirmed Main takes:

He says mask-wearing return certain locations, including Ben Gurion Airport, prevent variant spreading.
‚ÄúSchools unvaccinated children resume wearing masks ‚Äî we‚Äôve got go backwards.‚Äù

Neither unreasonable involving stifling restriction. article titles man‚Ä¶  Well, growth UK third wave quadratic rather exponential, already looks like rate new cases plateaued (although bit early say sure).  pretty us.

I happy see suburb ~50,000 people vaccination rate 90% (for 12+). age group 30-49 is, example, 95% vaccinated.  Uh, we‚Äôre charge buying it. Secondly it‚Äôs restricted 40s. government fucked bought enough select botched rest rollout. People would love get vaccinated able get back life. Sigh  7.9M CDC [county level clicking specific county shows vaccination numbers. England sends people, they're sending best. They're sending people lots problems, they're bringing problems us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. want Government assess risk act accordingly - Japan, Vietnam South Korea managed control COVID far better UK, without authoritarian controls taking giant wrecking ball economy.

Many pubs restaurants open, much Summer really shut Xmas balls Alpha variant, eat-out-to-help-out COVID free-for-all months prior.

Our COVID response shining beacon things - late every decision, reactionary rather proactive tied together blatant corruption seen Government.

If COVID response successful, 160k dead via disease could largely stopped source March 2020 ""taking back control"" borders, I'd hate see unsuccessful lockdown looks like. big fat birthday- he‚Äôs shot-averse‚Ä¶but happy know getting one make huge difference willing it‚Ä¶just birthday! He‚Äôll delay 2nd shot 3 days we‚Äôll town it‚Äôs due won‚Äôt fully vaccinated sooner either way. Studying possible causes important ruling lab leak like ruling existence ghosts.

Even find natural carrier virus people continue claim brought Wuhan scientists covered accidental leak.

And made political never hear end either way... think vaccine gap lot racial class politics.

Or certainly confusing read like that.

Republicans (particularly rural ones) black people seem two groups resistant. two exactly politically aligned time. Okay great, like what? Economically, likely massive amounts medical debt COVID-19 cases do? Especially Delta variant comes raging. 95% efficacy one small statistic related clinical trials vaccine. 

If that's number looking getting complete picture vaccine protects people real world. None far. tried looking....zero. final autopsy report come 8 days. Bangalore? ""I'm jealous"" - EncartaWow Canada change anything... like killing followers. Bad business model think it.  Mine got birthday lol Florida county live mobile vaccinations. one time saw van set up, 6 miles health department, distance reason still 70% (of eligible) least one dose. bible says apocalypse come Muslim comes bearing American flag

Never heard version bible before. Interesting chronology guess? Still better letting pandemic run wild PCR tests work came back negative vaccines. Even PCR test using primer picking stretch RNA injected mRNA vaccine, clear mRNA could make arm nose quantities enough cause false-positive. Thanks helpful. immediately day week? Oddly enough, context could talking Melbourne, Florida.

... recognise r/CoronavirusDownunder. vaccine think you‚Äôre idiot. think they‚Äôre idiot.

Only one set people right. Lots generalizations people dont agree with. many different views valid reasonings. prolife people religious pro choice people athetical. part previous post incorrect? fact PCR test looks traces virus RNA fact mRNA uses coronavirus RNA trigger immune system response body?

Do studies claiming actually CANNOT get false positive shortly mRNA vaccine?  Florida, rural areas specifically, list. last Friday, CDC reports 70% people rural county, eligible vaccinated, been. plenty doses available, excuse. you‚Äôve serving community front lines every single working day past 1.5 years you‚Äôve already exposed caught virus, you‚Äôre allowed decide it‚Äôs personally necessary you.

So problem requiring first responders vaccinated unless prove one two things: positive COVID-19 antibody test positive COVID-19 test/diagnosis (not close contact, flu like symptoms), right?

I mean, that's seem implying word choice. mean it‚Äôs belated birthday present really harmful misinformation spread. blogger edtimes also taken look this: [Do Really Get Magnetic Powers Take COVID-19 Maybe *[The  became known Trump tropics reason, similar, followers. Bolsonaristas like wear [shirts huging Brazilian flag wearing n4tional colors, saying people dislike antip4triotic.

But one thing helped US d3m0cratic institutions strong enough stop Trump succesfull c0up, I'm sure Brazilian dem0cracy survive 2022 (when next presidential el3ction happens). Either Bolsonaro wins cons0lidates power even more, try c0up, depending popularity political power, know stop him. really hope states significant restrictions first lockdown, travel curtailed WFH demanded employers.

Either deliberately obtuse, genuinely unaware restrictions.

To remind restrictions faced year:

* Illegal meet anyone outside household.
* Illegal get married.
* pubs, restaurants, bars closed.
* non-essential shops shut.
* allowed travel local area.
* Children allowed go school.

I know authoritarian ideals want restrictions worse that, assure I'd want part it. Would great birthday present... remeber az wSnt recommend older people unsure efficiency.

Some european politicians said that, never reasonable interpretation data. live liberal part Massachusetts. masks mostly gone men women. friend drove 100 miles get first second dose wanted early... need gone link posted original question. 

It said vaccine ""at may contain small part complete geneticaterial virus, won‚Äôt get detected tests"".

Hence asking whether one tested positive vaccine, whether likelihood false positive may increase. Upvoted ""biggest yeehawing Fox-watching inbred dipshit Alabama""  fully agree you. Thanks elaborating this. keep mind none provinces Canada, believe, required wearing masks outdoors point epidemic, wearing masks indoors would still largely left discretion businesses. much less contentious issue US, went harder directions. worked retail last year. bad jokes never stopped. hate people fucking insult laughing lame attempts humor.

Sadly, narcissists pretend laugh everything ruin rest us. oldest 12 tomorrow‚Ä¶I‚Äôm making get birthday take next day. Really hope approved 12 soon. not? works nice distribution vaccinated people equal across ages subgroups isn‚Äôt. spread among kids  age group 25-30 didnt NHS number. applied one day could register vaccine, took NHS today fully process it. Honestly, don‚Äôt think anyone would recognize ‚Äúnon-fluffy‚Äù version BoJo. Instead spreading crap like that, ‚ÄúVaccine performs well vaccine performs worse‚Äù Crossed 7.5m üòÑ wish Alabama would this.  AZ JnJ took big hit 10 day ban FDA due rare clotting issue. Also Pfizer moderna network effect - people know Pfizer would naturally want Pfizer. approved vaccines necessarily bad inferior really good preventing worst case outcome. get whatever available long aware small clotting risk AZ. can‚Äôt wait till vaccine available people completely write idiots choose get it. that's fine Australia never wants open borders happy random localised lockdowns every time case escapes quarantine. everyone wants get back holidays Bali etc, need enough people vaccinated wipe spread. Fingers crossed. think we‚Äôre point pandemic cases slowly rising doesn‚Äôt mean exponential growth happening like used to. U.S., ask doctor monoclonal antibody treatments. They're provided free government high risk people like yourself. Really? 

I've work every single day since pandemic began. day I've seen 300+ unique customers, I've shopped supermarkets busier pre-pandemic, I've able travel throughout Scotland work see kids. inquiry whether journey legitimate essential.

The current restrictions place nightclubs open weddings 30 people.

The significant restrictions first lockdown, travel curtailed WFH demanded employers.

If lockdowns way effective, base 3rd (or 4th) wave, cases ever-increasing 160,000 dead.

As said, lockdown name only.  AE feel like figured EXTREMELY last minute? Fuck implications. Put situation. Would want everyday pure torture loved one? kind person would want that? necessarily wrong, might missed certain factors. could also something special Canadian population (maybe likely take kind medication interacts kind special way). truly baffling modern medicine come *something* viable less invasive antiquated stabby nonsense now.

Why can't drink it? tablet? can't shoot nose? many substances cross blood-brain barrier honestly unreal. That‚Äôs awesome hear, pace India needs get pandemic. always going challenge vaccinate literally billion people great sign. point line says SARS 1 leaking multiple labs china? I'm seeing it.  Good see vaccine numbers steadily tick along. think 70% adults happen end summer? Seems like definitely possible. hard really know what's going Russia considering situation state media. I've started look situation evolutionary pressure point view. virus mutates time, views people mutate well. We're already seeing play continue evolve. dance, push pull... Brilliant news! one (CovidSafeBe) lots people co-operated government let people come India

The Delta variant many countries too, thought. saying government never let people come rest Europe, US, parts world? people country never allowed travel anywhere? India‚Äôs figure scares me. country‚Äôs gonna unleash variant fucks current vaccines, it‚Äôs India. answer right byline

‚ÄúThe fatality rate trails behind infections, Pakistan‚Äôs morbidity rates take awhile fall.‚Äù Free government hospitals paid private hospitals. still seems bit premature dropping masks opening nightclubs many people still waiting get vaccinated.  J&amp;k I‚Äôve experienced bodily defence far less severe capacity.

Had bad bought Tonsillitis couple years back could get meds body produced T-cells fight infection apparently produced cells place go attack body, case skin. broke psoriasis body mean over, itchiest shit ever. Lots creams, sun bathing 8 months later gone. get odd spot occasion nothing major. Thank you... Agreed good luck changing 1.2 billon people‚Äôs way thinking!  Asking ceasefire health reasons would great could seems fairly unlikely. parents got AZ 1st Moderna 2nd CAN. Honestly, Russia exactly? outside looks like never took covid seriously. restrictions joke compared rest Europe, loads excess deaths opened everything months ago. Plus bother vaccinating people. see ""working"".   Yes, governments lie, think country lie either? Look cases start going vaccinated countries did. mean time getting poke hoping best.   PA's Covid database funny position. According site, 97% covid cases state recovered, leading around 8k active cases state per website. Problem is, technically can't go much higher 97% recovered. does, PA would negative active covid cases. something thought funny lol. I'm little while. morons lying vaccinated falsifying vaccine records. GF daughters (all vaccinated now) went Mexico week take test return US. little annoying, people going snag. Indians colonized British. large number killed starved. got decent way communicating rest world. colonialism **choice**.

It must mind boggling yet another white person telling brown people choice.

The number system invented indians brought people Arab. think indians however please opinion irrelevant. Theres like Billion + people India. gonna take awhile pandemic ends, government announcement. wonderful thing. feel like there's worthwhile point here. expand some? I'm sympathy cards 100% this. family, GFs family followed local rules (social distancing, staying home, masks, travel, etc.), watching dummies go travel world like nothing wrong. essentially gave year lives make sure helped fight pandemic vaccinated (my youngest got second shot little week ago), restarted lives. people choose get vaccine available, that's fallout fault. *should* feel sad us! strangers constantly beg attention deeply uncomfortable.

Even minute critical thinking lead child past stumbled. sure.. probably alright worry. believe symptoms brain damage quite severe would definitely notice. Tbf capped different. US monopoly vaccine orders, probably aware tug war went get IPs released.

Still, vaccinating 8.2 million people one day, free. That's incredible.

Edit: mention today first day central govt led vaccination drive. wish adopted much earlier giving states freedom manage vaccines. That's yet another layer offal parfait.    48% population got 1st dose 26% fully vaccinated hardly environment want relax many measures (no masks indoors, group size limit gatherings, schools full capacity, etc.).

And vaccination numbers likely optimistic side 25% numbers based estimates: shot considered administered within 5 days shipping GPs hospitals, 1% considered waste process tracking many vaccinations, 22% claimed vaccinations system yet, knows part never gets registered great optimistic everyone eager get back normal, hardly moment scale... No, Mandalore. still remember video early stages pandemic last year, guy living Russia claiming virus nothing Russia meds already worked virus life continued normal, remember name, Mexican well, know turned out.  coronalert another app? obviously sarcasm.

Thanks Naturally. it‚Äôs completely resistant vaccines, we‚Äôd essentially back March 2020 different. case smokers asking people AVOID something, something addictive.

In case car accident...it's accident. 

In case covid, nobody asked avoid anything. instead, midst global pandemic essentially shut world, told get free vaccine. cannot compare smoking car accident. 

The thing smoker risk others. Someone covid is. literally contagious infect people danger around them. treating smoker car accident patient put medical staff danger someone covid entering medical facility absolutely DOES. Even vaccinated people get breakthrough infections covid mention immunocompromised (ie. hospital patients). 

People unvaccinated also contribute spread variants. 

So yes hear point cannot compared asking someone change entire lifestyle quit addiction avoid accident. people never publix sub. :(   Anyone believing this

This government 50 k real tests 450 k ppl. reference:

75 lakh = 7.5 million ‡§∂‡§æ‡§¨‡§æ‡§∂ ‡§Ø‡§æ‡§∞‡•§  may unpopular opinion sub point don‚Äôt think asking masks schools airports unreasonable. Yup. Although COVID notable actual brain damage, albeit seems due blood clotting causing damage rather direct means (although mechanics causes common ""brain fog"" effect fully understood all).

(Clotting-wise: misleading title article? Pretty sure burnout, many people left un-exposed. think good till new variant appears.  *smirks minnesotan* term brain damage rather strong damage actually olfactory receptor neurons border would call nose brain.

In fact, symptom obvious due high level ACE2 expression olfactory system. 8.27million now. Great number skeptical sustained. Based government communication 135 million target July 4.5 milion(or slightly lower July 31 days). June product would even lower. one day surge new availability. Tomorrow's number look disappointing comparison. 

Even India 3 million per day accelerate 5million august, India able vaccinate 18+ adults EOY. expect 12+ vaccination start hopefully August well. May see vaccines well like Novavax J&amp;D Pfizer etc. state from?  is, he‚Äôs freaking saint IMO Yes 75% vaccines bought government manufacturers low prices (2-4$ dose) manufacturers allowed supply 25% private hospitals much higher prices (12-20$ dose)

Essentially manufacturers making low/no profits government sale earning profits private ones

People afford 12-20$ price get private hospitals don‚Äôt lines, air conditioned waiting rooms etc. Others get government facilities bigger lines less ‚Äúfancy‚Äù facilities Good job! actually reduced caffeine intake since COVID felt fine. Lately though, it‚Äôs whole beast. catch covid, whether asymptotically not, you‚Äôll find sure it‚Äôs ‚Äúall heads.‚Äù  Oh yeah, everybody's aware event, thanks sharing. Thought missed new report thoroughly surprised. Even warranted makes sense decide based conspiracy theories. Authorities say deaths Russia massively under-reported undercounted. Estimates 500,000 million.

Are survival odds higher refusing vaccine distrust government? media either negligently maliciously refuses understand way holidays affect reporting cases deaths US. Ah okay yeah misremembered story saw; tests, vaccines. keep seeing stories covid numbers manipulated I‚Äôm glad vaccines well tracked. mRNA Pfizer/Moderna vaccines gets destroyed couple hours injection. one advocating genocide. no, Americans supposed believe misinformation, vat doing? Wait, country left citizens stranded countries catch disease suffer rather allow come home standard morality?  No. Many free centers paid centers. like 90% free centers 10% paid. Initially, free paid slots booked app would run immediately soon opened. people would run scripts track registration page get alerted whenever slots opened up.

So first couple months people money got vaccine, free paid centers, tech savvy able open app register.

And price vaccine $15 paid centers throw away money middle class (about 40-50% population) especially life saving vaccine. actually HUGE difference. difference accidental leak lab, China knew (and likely China-funded well) lied entire world year. Now, much surprise China we're talking about, could one single consequential lies coming one largest powers world centuries. realize projected DEATHS decline coming weeks takes time die catch covid. There's 3 week lag case curves death curves. person responding projected deaths fall farther are. Historical data disputes prediction. jump irrelevant reply claimed way incorrect.   Yes difference assuming naturally acquired herd immunity already reached vs. saying herd immunity reached vaccinating everyone. Zero isn‚Äôt realistic 20% country doesn‚Äôt want get vaccinated.  UK higher proportion population fully vaccinated US long what? Living like specifically? restrictions wearing masks public transport indoor suburbs Sydney. 

If mean like wearing mask indoors, also dislike wearing masks. worn mask months, feel dries eyes. I'm avoiding public transport moment.

If assumed lockdown, lockdown. live Sydney sort lockdown since early mid last year. Even lockdown, always allowed go work office shops never closed.  horribly complicated situation, feel like protests military coup important virus currently Myanmar. people stop fighting one minute, lets junta catch breath.

And scumbag junta die covid better imo Portugal Russia still low vaccination rates, Delta variant explode there. UK seeded Delta variant early age based vaccination strategy led quickly explode among unvaccinated young populations.  I'm curious why. Serosurveillance showed 70% prevalence even second wave. nice article nature faulty studies led complacency government population. title seems bit misleading. number ""hard nos"" is, indeed, second highest list 15 countries. 


If compare numbers ""uncertain"" hard nos, US 3rd Russia (56%), Australia (37%), US (31%). That's pretty bad, right? Well, let's compare next spots.

Japan (30%). France (29%). Germany (28%).

The difference relatively small. given state ""uncertains"", actual rankings people willing get vaccinated unknown. long? guess. Still annoying, though. part doesn‚Äôt work idea start decline never increase again.

I don‚Äôt dispute correlation cases deaths.   US test case world, specifically areas sit around 50% vax rate. enough slow delta enough it‚Äôs big problem? Guess we‚Äôll see look two world super powers smh head.
/s Ummm, American living Melbourne, assure first-hand experience hard lockdowns effective preventing death containing spread. see happens anti-Vaxers get wiped out

Yes, virus survival rate definitely going wipe entire population people. almost like people fantasize mass deaths oppose. long vaccines expiring thrown away still fine. Vaccinating somebody Mexico India least good vaccinating somebody Colorado. trust Tobacco Industrial Complex completely... People done caring. want country open things back normal. #TimesUp Sounds like they‚Äôre living India. means living China thing happened they‚Äôd feel way they‚Äôd still lost people lives literally living nightmare. Show goddamn empathy. went paid center. queue least 1 km long outside center. system efficient. Got shot 2 hours waiting. Uh.... that? USA whole unwilling what‚Äôs right. lot things could‚Äôve done pre-vaccine mitigate this. things still options.

Again, Sincerely, 
A country **zero** deaths 2021 Funny nobody said word China despite evidence emerging made lab. works?

Cases go up, deaths go up. Cases go down, deaths go down. dispute this? way Melbourne's lockdown policies refute this? idea lock 0 deaths insanity, since can't possibly reach point. literally arguing locking rest human existence.  Fun anecdote - friend driving somewhere Novosibirsk going probably 80km/h 50 zone. mentioned quite bit worried getting ticket? shocked speeding tickets actually commonly given Canada asked concerned country becoming authoritarian.

So... Russia places, speed limits seem authoritarian. It‚Äôs crazy jumbo jet‚Äôs worth people still dying shit everyday. depends try go door once. Yea, crazy. Americans done ""covid"", apparently triggered anything good news.

We're done hospitalizations deaths continue drop despite opening up. time lockdowns fall going likely capacity restrictions again

Nah. Got vaccines natural immunities time spread like before. Lots american anti-vaxx propaganda originates promoted Russia, makes that‚Äôs works. was, wouldn‚Äôt hard lockdown four separate times Melbourne. country closely mirrors 13 countries list Russia hey, click link look chart instead writing sarcastic comment based headline written specifically gullible readers. disagree religion factor. America long history also religion working vaccination campaigns. Churches often served vaccination centers, first inocculation campaign America led Puritan minister Cotton Mather 1721 problem India vaccination rates low. Like 4% population fully vaccinated, 15% first dose. currently aren‚Äôt using mRNA vaccine, using AZ really needs second dose really effective inactivated virus vaccine Covaxin. Good news, thanks vaccines. watch delta variant haven‚Äôt gotten vaccinated yet, please so. Stop watching news. consistently last decades. 

Do think happen unvaxxed? Can‚Äôt speak US UK priority groups make 99% deaths 80% hospitalisations double vaxxed rate 90%. Yeah I'm pretty sure talking Bangalore. Faced exact situation. Dose 1 easily available Bangalore now.  Huh?

Monsoon = get outside. heat finally becomes bearable venture outside.

Though monsoon hit Delhi yet. delta plus stuff really worth worrying regular people moment. popped independently many countries gained foothold anywhere. current risk everywhere regular (without K mutation) Delta variant. say red listed India 23rd April. 3 weeks earlier good folk r/CoronavirusUK calling media.

After Red listing hundreds flights continued. link (can't bothered looking up) made national news scandal.

Another scandal quarantine system itself. Passengers red list segregated others. India flight passengers going passport control collecting baggage passengers green list.

All needed strict controls India start April we'd fully open now.

Edit, quote talking completely restricting variants. I'll point aim. Sadly, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre aware, Americans totally 100% okay people different beliefs voting habits dying. fact, I‚Äôve seen outright encouraged number times. long vaccine still works, I‚Äôm going care lives knows even get herd immunity fall gets colder virus spread rampantly.

Also went Haldiram. I'm Idiot. Given cases continued falling past 3 weeks, expect deaths continue falling near future.  key word ""tracked."" quick google search shows vaccine hesitancy [among EU (25%) higher US (20%). Vaccine hesitancy also higher European countries [like (26%). course data hard come every country politicizes hesitancy rates like good ol' USA headlines like ""US top-third hesitancy"" quite gather number clicks. ‚ÄúMissouri leads nation per-capita COVID-19 cases fourth behind California, Florida Texas number new cases per day past week despite significantly smaller population.‚Äù

No surprise there. state full idiot don‚Äôt believe Covid.  needs fixed. nothing overtly political comment. sero surveys believed, already over. Cities crossing 70% sero prevalence. I'm wondering skip me. Seriously, WTF talking about? lost 4 people extended family 14 overall last two months. Every single time phone rang, dreading bad news. horrible. least show empathy people talking loss bring stupid political views. current govt shares lot common Chinese one actual democracy. take stupid whataboutism somewhere else. free though. free government hospitals. Private hospitals allowed charge ~10 $ covishield. I'm sure significant number money issue opt well.   It'll interesting see voting broken demographic next time comparison 2020 2016, know party vast majority voting for. GA is, sadly, slightly ahead states listed. TN next worse 34.4%.  Oh yes totally, absolutely crazy since units even scale proportion.  researcher (university professor biochemistry, think) making news country, Portugal, saying herd immunity realistic idea COVID restrictions upheld years come, vaccinated people still get sick regardless pass virus. still urged people get vaccinated pretty much said pointless, restrictions upheld years come. Crowded events, masks family reunions, specially elderly, return years come according him.

As Americans already returning certain degree normalcy, think? Sometimes sound really negative sub we're really exposed British and, course, Portuguese news really gloomy. Portuguese experts are, large, claiming new lockdown saying 25% population vaccinated nothing delta variant. I've noticed positive news UK late, still feel really confused. We, Lisbon region, already semi-lockdown weekends (yeah, weekends lol). mental health can't handle another lockdown, and, fully vaccinated, understand can't relatives. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs even possible, take it‚Äôs worth. 11 states, 20% senior citizens remain unvaccinated, rate much higher national average, New York Times matters: People 65 years old particularly vulnerable experiencing severe symptoms death Seniors remain unvaccinated could threaten states' recoveries virus, especially many states move ease health restrictions, notes Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina Tennessee. Georgia, Idaho Missouri roughly 20% seniors received single dose West Virginia Wyoming, 20% gotten first doses. used Bolsonaro called genocidal figure Brazil.

I understand equating them, I'm calling anyone anything like that. I'm unlucky enough anti-vaccine family members along whole cursed spectrum. bruh

&amp;#x200B;

also cant get flair wtf come back comment, saw Twitter. think they‚Äôre trying pass survival rate ages 0-19 everybody? don‚Äôt know you, sure age 19. Worries kids 12. true. People don‚Äôt trust government Russia, hence low vaccination numbers.    Vaccine passports please one anti vax idiots, stay fuck Canada. Huh, wonder GA list still sitting 34.8% fully vaccinated ü§î   Last data point last week (which included sequencing data cases early June) Germany \~6% Delta. New numbers expected Wednesday Delta probably 10%+ then, Alpha going extinct pretty quickly Germany.

It's looking bad though. Estimated number weekly Delta cases \~2000 month ago, \~1000. guess could 2000 Wednesday update lifted restrictions past weeks, still vaccinations administer safe Delta.  HOA offer $20 hour lifeguards summer get pool open. least health workers get vaccinated. Imagine watching CNN.

Unless means specific towns/counties? so, ones? Russian government lied keeps lying everyone. Nobody trusts good noble thing. It‚Äôs long time. Misleading headlines awesome really saying anything contradicts said wished central government begun distribute vaccines first day, rather granting states freedom so

Yeah that's point agree with. Again, states literally started run vaccines procurement central government demanded vaccines available centre. would Indian Central Government distribution day 1 fix issue? would run issue. again, distribution main problem, lack availability vaccines were. Yeah... that's happening. CDC already comparing cases population whole - even though **know** occurs young men response vaccine - try sweep rug.

It's real shame looking solve instead. top off, healthcare system forces people pay hospital bill response vaccine-related side effects like these, putting lot financial burden individual. Pfizer myocarditis cases required trip hospital. Similar issues parts states, though much smaller rural percentage population believe.

Some already isolated difficult get them. Farmers, ranchers, ag workers, etc. small villages hundred thousand staunchly anti-vaxx general. storage requirements vaccines also impacting way handled.

Why send 50k vaccines surrounding villages towns high chance expiring used?

I glad policy makers involved decisions.  supposed joke brain loss.. meh Better late never mean except long term health prblems expirence catching virus. know higher health cost means higher premiums all.

No shit. Curfews produce sorts changes people congregate. That's I'm telling baselessly speculating. Fuck around find out, right? variant keeps dropping efficacy numbers. first shot AZ mid-April. Getting 2nd shot Moderna, week 10 weeks Ontario. I‚Äôve seen ‚Äúrational‚Äù selfish version ‚ÄúI‚Äôm taking vaccine‚Äù around. Basically understand facts, decide rely herd immunity. It‚Äôs infuriating. *baseless* speculation - based simple fact reduce amount time people get things done, *more people time, place.*

if give people 6 hours trip, 30min/360/min*1000people = 83 people, average, store time.

Less people one place time means physical distance people, thus reducing chances transmitting COVID.

It's affect curfews have, agree, pretty clear obvious one - one would make COVID situation much worse. hahaha English hard. major variant chips away that.

They're beaten known vaccines vast majority cases.  would stop people thinking vaccine magical shield gives immunity Covid

Seen quite afew believe current cases unvaccinated, terms thinking Herd immunity away That's exactly logic play  Thank addressing obsession getting mRNA J&amp;J patient. talking one thing (willfully unvaccinated people hospitalized &amp; costs covered insurance), brought something TOTALLY different (rare vaccine injuries, apparently covered government programs). 

Vaccines saving asses, muddy waters clear fact, you‚Äôre anti-vax PERIOD. talking one thing (willfully unvaccinated people hospitalized &amp; costs covered insurance), brought something TOTALLY different (rare vaccine injuries, apparently covered government programs). 

Vaccines saving asses, muddy waters clear fact, you‚Äôre anti-vax PERIOD.  Anyone know symptoms lead hospitalization delta variant? Articles say less likely cough... respiratory issues requiring delta patients hospitalized, extreme fever? Organ failure? Something else? understand efficacy rates mean? means no, there's higher chance could become infected Delta variant despite vaccination. happens, also higher chance worse base virus infection. Let‚Äôs separate teams.

It's late that. There's sizeable crowd panics demands lockdowns renew every time variant announced, literally want continue masking indefinitely.

They're absolutely impervious shown evidence source showing infections coming new wave, hospitalizations/deaths falling cliff. workers required paid slavery ok? People Vancouver hate human interaction yet complain lonely alone. It‚Äôs hilarious. Yeah, they‚Äôre *not* covered vaccines variants keep evolving. it‚Äôs back square one. Give short hard wuhan lockdown day rather protracted, reactive, slow response we‚Äôve seen west.

It‚Äôs difficult understand concept exponential growth (like snowballing computer game) , virus severely repressed vastly easier control.

It maddening watch slow gradual reaction. I‚Äôm Norway, population trusting government could easily pulled hard measures succeeded near eradication beginning. could New Zealand easily. Wednesday, able communicate occasionally opened eyes, Mrs Kelk said. 


Yup... thought US like 52% vaccinated Need mandate vaccinations give kids anti-vax karens? 
also people saying covid 19 real Great hear, knew got slow start. I‚Äôm anti vax, earth take vaccine? first anyone know take back January.

What‚Äôs harm mass campaign assuring public government pay vaccine injuries? anti-vax position? 

How ANYTHING I‚Äôm saying promoting anti-vax position? happens virus continues playground variants keep developing. rest us pay ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù others. Ya, wearing masks even gloves, problem attending UT Dallas fall where, guessing, wear mask. Normally choosing hill die expression, one half America seem quite understand literal case. I've got friend know. tried avoid infection. husband got vaccines came out. recovered. post covid blood clots still killed her. Large portions CDC, NIH FDA refused vaccination well.
Fact vaccine deaths last six months entire history vaccines. Something think ü§î Seriously? They‚Äôre 50%? pushing 80% least. can‚Äôt right. crazy see UK Delta surge articles written tone still March 2020. positivity rate 1%, rate case increase slowing, hospitalization rate lower NYC; economy open point pandemic. Lots encouraging data coming vaccine efficacy severe disease. Chill media!   Check see skin magnetic! anti-social rest life? Apparently past week there's outbreaks schools lifting mask mandates kids. idea source floating around, source outbreak people traveled abroad though.  wear times I'm sleeping. I'm ok without day long I'm exerting myself.

Thank well wishes. really appreciate it.  heart goes you, mate. You‚Äôre disingenuous. talking one thing brought something completely different. I‚Äôm going read comment history, little stunt wreaks anti-vax tactics.

If you‚Äôre actually interested answer question, read vaccine injuries covered government health cared worker doesn‚Äôt make person pro-vax (I‚Äôve learned). Tons tons anti-vax health care workers there, unfortunately (and shockingly). source curfews making things worse. baselessly speculating 0 evidence behind opinion. total nonsense coming you. Yea differences well different vaccines protect different variants. vaccines still generally offer quite good protection variants, still something keep eye on. effectiveness begins drop low, vaccine redesign might necessary.  20% last winters peak doesn‚Äôt seem much cause concern. think America, things keep ticking till everyone jabbed infected. people fuckload smarter us degenerates reddit telling us wont. OP also use word evil devil incarnate. one bringing language.  know plenty people believe abortion killing human life.

Those people generally conservative and/or religious. heavily indoctrinated generally favor wars executions perhaps philosophical worldview well Watch abortion performed see baby tries escape suction.

I guarantee bought pro-life propaganda point, vast majority abortions first two trimesters. world vaccinated.  unvaccinated US small part unvaccinated people world.  Yeah choose get vaccinated stupid, effect totality situation globally. USA like 5% world population.  

And ""experts"" media talking shit help all.

Me vaccinated almost everything plausible.  even got first two Lyme disease vacs. went market third dose. I'm sorry thought comment different thread one person's relative died. can't justify myself. I'm deeply sorry. People refuse let others right die situations evil get. even talking about?

Most doctors governments across world support physical distancing reduce COVID. saying want source that?

I understand trying say here. I'd rather die point, everything would suffering. evidence whatsoever. Baseless speculation. Got it. tried this, able get record, 2nd try. go check email address used first dose vaccine, correct, worked.

So, finding record, double-check email address phone # ones used getting first dose. appears thing put nail coffin well eradicate danger completely

There's remote possibility vaccine confers sterilizing immunity (none current ones this) could achieve - provided manage logistics vaccinating every person planet medical contra-indication short period time. possibility extremely remote, considering virus readily infects many species humans;.

Whether even **possible** create vaccine confers sterilizing immunity unknown. SARS-CoV-2 already become endemic. Annual flu seasons simply become annual COVID seasons. I'm willing bet vaccine vaccine look forward renewed mask mandates next winter.  kid probably die it, exactly want lose brain tissue either.  Chief health officer realty department confirmed press conference yesterday democrats history defending education? specific examples? republicans democrats must done well?  never wear makeup Yes, unless legitimate medical exemption suspended vaxxed. Same. still want avoid catching though. everyone could vaccinated covid could eradicated.   effective hospitalization

If you‚Äôve reading lately, you‚Äôll know don‚Äôt need hospitalized enjoy many Covid‚Äòs long term health impacts, brain damage hearing loss erectile dysfunction course lung heart damage familiar with. Many associated ‚Äúmild‚Äù even asymptomatic cases.  


I mean vaccines work amazingly well, they‚Äôre magic Covid profoundly destructive disease. flu. saddest thing actual immune suppressants rest short life. it‚Äôs cold? (Joke) terrible reality. suffering must intense.  mean, agree places probably need restrictions, don‚Äôt know could possibly believe going impose them.

In Fall, Blue areas going fine due vax rates need restrictions, none imposed.

Red areas going terriblly need restrictions. restrictions politically untenable even *everyone* them, doubly untenable now. Politicians won‚Äôt impose them, people refused vaccines would refuse follow anyways.

Mark ny words, happen. I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs want happen, will. lol really believe see people ignorant Current vaccines probably good enough live normally modest precautions somewhere high uptake good surveillance Israel. quarantine mentioned article [has already variant completely evade vaccines. MRNA target one area virus cannot mutate much else longer affect humans mean? remember case. think 19.

And read around time transplanted lungs last 5-10 years max. know. Many access de-prioritized. problem different illnesses contagious therefore anyone covid puts others risk, including vaccinated also others may immunocompromised. random person going seek medical treatment; people risk others. issue people may decline vaccine believe get covid access immediate medical attention justification getting vaccinated. 

I also thinking possibility insurance paying less paying medical care people declined vaccine (without medical exemption)? maybe get care use resources put others peoples lives risk, end pay it?

There need consequences. family friend mine‚Äôs 29 year old son died COVID-19. volunteer firefighter. also another family friend whose 16 year old daughter almost died COVID-19. critical condition, though thankfully managed make alive.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* That's calling 7 day average. Lots states switched model. lot people opposed vaccine motivated get it. others waiting full FDA approval. would unwise ostracise every person yet vaccinated. Pfizer vaccine 98% effective hospitalization delta variant.

That *reduction risk* otherwise would be, around 5-10% age groups. means hospitalization rate vaccinated becomes 0.1% 0.2%.

The chances death another factor 5-10 lower this.

In addition, Gottlieb saying pessimistic prediction peak 1/5th last year. reduces everyone‚Äôs risk another factor 5 top above.

Your personal risk small, even variants, vaccinated. vaccinated people going change lifestyles based small risk. Yeah agree approach, people also temper expectations. know evidence is, came long lockdown started things everyone know got really, really sick. feel like friends illness affected least week. seems like inside time interacting anyone weakened immune systems something, everyone got crazy sick.  dad's wife refuses vaccine says ""trusts God, taking would going will,"" deadly allergic bees carries EPI pen, hypocrisy makes head hurt. force inject euthanize objectors then. tattoo received. can't.......yet.

Currently, coronavirus vaccine currently fully approved FDA. Three given emergency use authorization agency. full approval given, either health premiums unvaccinated skyrocket they'll facing denials coverage. curious. average age people situation?

Probably missing brain I‚Äôm guessing, feel fall yet really seen 90% effective vaccine given (relatively random) 90% population guarantee elimination virus R0 less 8 long enough time horizon. 

It matter eliminated rest world; imported spread die quickly even hops original host, similar measles outbreaks die quickly (at least long vaccination rates decline further). call health care systems really right be. We‚Äôre born fragile imperfect women vaccinated US men. You‚Äôre suggesting solution problem doesn‚Äôt exist. historical existing programs compensate rare occurrence vaccine injury. bring then? Weirdly, person know really affected lot vaccine also avid runner (still like really bad flu three days - everyone else felt bit tired feverish most, flattened like was). parties done this. thought populace dummies would easier control. think issue able eliminate disease less long efficacy is. 

I'm guessing might last closer year given early reports. might need variant boosters. 

The problem many people avoiding vaccine ignorance. could get people vaccinated could start reach herd immunity focus poorer countries. Eventually knocking covid-19 far back becomes minor concern. 

But won't. can't even get yahoos wearing masks slow spread. 

So created new normal covid-19 part lives going forward.  Put unpaid leave till fully Vax. Pretty simple. point carrot longer works. Time stick. I'll sympathetic extremely rare cases actually die, I'm also well aware flu shown fatal 12s Covid Believe like. job educate you. non issue. historical border crossings place, countries totally integrated. 

Yeah guess could imagine border dwellers crossing forests, would still cut travel 99.99%

Being island doesn‚Äôt matter much. Absolutely doable. Right vaccines seem solid protection known variants. yes, covid allowed mutate spread unchecked pockets unvaccinated people, chance something vaccine resistant developing. 

I‚Äôm optimistic science keep large extent, also want see things opening back up, idea forget unvaccinated sit well me. Ah.. yeah I'm worried people sick areas trying safe. wild ""measly respiratory virus"" (as people know put ) able cause destructive effects people infects. scary know COVID ability damage brain. sound like guy know got Covid. ultra marathon runner, would run minimum 15 miles day, rest days.

I followed start, maddening watch slow incompetence. Actually data available shows delays improved vaccine effectiveness.

This entirely line vaccines past. Long periods vaccination boost effectiveness.  Oops. Unvaccinated adults. I've calling since released. lasts 6 months.

Moreover, article cites least one plausible reason behaviour, namely chemical composition U codon mRNA used. certainly sounds like better starting point investigation ""the intern running study misjudged side effect severity"". ;)  news somewhere fox  Canada also mixing even mRNA. basically show dose 2 see get.

Anyway Friend chat pm? Hahahaha see,so yet vaccinated ? convert vaccine costs $145 üòîü§¶  cases say guy got brief contact often wrong often times already undocumented community spread going on. thing happened U.S. cases started sprouting starting Northern California randomly appear different areas U.S. march 2020. turned community spread already happening fall 2019 undetected. 

SARS-CoV-2 drop transmission bioaerosol transmission outside often rare aerosol carry virion last long outside due lack humidity elevated heat. Yeah. I'm saying people lying think people lying. 

Covid definitely real killed millions around world number people claiming personally know multiple, unrelated people died seems implausible. know confidence coming from. really anti vaxxer god, father work pfizer something? could u possibly know shit? really science, science asking questions. Rollout controlled government based peoples medical conditions age. 

I'm healthy young access it. private options available, I' even allowed leave country obtain dose overseas lol Oh yeah shows vaccine normal,thanks sharing experience üôè.It would really help feel prepared anytime get money,I go get vaccinated Something better nothing Oh get,what mean access? lives rich tourists traveling Qatar. want go history World Cup killed thousands fans. eh depends context. Well good friends. dad died tragically 2 years ago early heart attack 26. covid came thanked God least dad died real disease, real disease people deny constantly. CF? Wish best! know hard üíú Larry happy guy? second sentence us EXACTLY borderline overprotective young kids last year this. ""They'll probably fine"" would say ""we can't activity without wearing masks."" people would get minor symptoms recover quickly, could also get massive organ failure lung failure end like gentleman. me, never worth risk family getting sick even worse, carrier 76 year old FIL who's lung cancer twice 5 years contracts it. don‚Äôt see people keep commenting stuff like this. one Covid treatments completely covered two sort health insurance maximum pocket would kicked thousand. Well definitely easy access vaccine still live rural area. still trickling in, doubt cross 60% threshold nationwide. Average life expectancy much objective strength, though. I‚Äôm sure heteronormativity affects life expectancy Same. I'm getting sick governments expect citizens sacrifice fight covid absolute hsit job making sacrifices help maintain order create social support systems citizenry .  
  
We're fight together clearly class legislators completely different goals rest us . want go vacation girlfriend without feeling like touching wrong doorknob eating wrong room wrong people gonna get e killed .  


Meanwhile government several others seem consumed making investors wealthy whether stockmarket , business owners, they're horrified economic cost covid want able enjoy day without feeling like imminent death back mind . 

 
I amazes many societies expect individual always take risk institutions leaders never seem sacrifice anything .  We've Netherlands since beginning. Really confused numbers here. Roughly 50% Israelis vaccinated vaccinated represent 33% recent outbreaks. vaccine 88% effective, can‚Äôt case right?

Also mean individual cities worldwide higher vaccine uptake Israel? instance San Francisco 65% total population (71% 12) vaccinated. sort health insurance would several thousand most. Tell Boss demands come unless absolutely can't. people read articles like this. roll eyes headline scroll Facebook feed. agree, two family members really could died. Thankfully recovered idk long term symptoms have. That's extremely ignorant would take much time unpack. That's like saying ""men higher strength women"" ignorantly ignoring systemic racism involved collecting statistics, overlooking heteronormative conventions leads bias, more. got first shot month ago. co worker asked felt told pretty tired. 

She started yelling that‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt getting vaccine, side effects! 

One co workers died April last year COVID. 

I slept really well 2 days. know option would choose. Government/scientists still recommend test confirm COVID. vaccinated project yourself, test isolate/quarantaine protect others.

And no, indefinitely time being. argument can't lift restrictions people accept there's another wave? No, CA first responders incredibly high infection rate.

I believe might true NYC though. two friends depressed immune systems. One organ recipient, immuno-suppressant drugs required there. (I know what's other.)  Also, that‚Äôs ‚Äúaggressive estimate‚Äù. possibly less that. I'm currently recovering long-covid. conform first 5 days felt like regular cold. started get better 5 days good symptom free, hit lungs sudden. Since experiencing extreme shortness breath, even turning bed task made barely able breath. 

Also first jab getting covid. I'm 5 weeks since couple days sit dining table hours work 2 hours day (in IT). see actual price UK AZ vaccine costs $3/dose. two doses = $6 Hospitals treat drunk drivers too, know. Thank God.

Funny advocating letting people die yet think morally superior.

(I'm fully vaccinated can't stand anti-vaxxers either, reccord.) Health Ministry considering changing recommendation regarding vaccinating 12- 15-year-olds, spokeswoman coronavirus coordinator Prof. Nachman Ash told Post. ‚ÄúWe may move stronger recommendation children,‚Äù need much stringent border,‚Äù Cohen told Post, adding travelers entering Israel take PCR test results delivered within 24 hours, also rapid test try screen anyone might vaccinated carrying virus.

I think policies, comprehensively vaccinated countries look forward Covid free future.     Would keep homeless guy ICU 14 months?  gonna lie, northeast I'm gonna pretend selfless selfish want protect health want lives back. I‚Äôve committed idea virus came labs Wuhan anyone, acceptable say - there‚Äôs absolutely zero reason think made deliberately weapon. far bioweapons go, coronaviruses make really really bad ones.

Even you‚Äôre willing make particular stretch, idea brain fog deliberately selected side-effect even longer one. Like we‚Äôre talking Grand Canyon-sized stretch here. story like wish people understood virus nothing like flu. something either minor inconvenience cases people like Mr Kelk battled 14 months unimaginable levels pain suffering nobody ever go through.

Yet still people care desires, care could cause someone else sick possibly end like poor guy here. lost good amount people friends family. People never call talk again, ask day was, wish happy birthday recently hear wishing happy birthday me. feel honestly want virus gone much next person continue wear mask, wash hands, chose get vaccine. feel much pain!

Cool,anyway vaccine effects? Hopefully sounding pedantic here- variants comprehensively evade vaccines sure variants vaccine resistant others, we're using generally accepted definition resistant

_Capable of, offering, showing resistance.._

As awful sounds, think stories like may push dumbasses finally get vaccinated. Yes hear might affect sexual organs though heard one 4 months ago. Huh, makes sense. 

I'm doctor either, find medical science incredibly interesting except Alberta restrictions set expire 11 days  Yeah, actually, said immunosuppressant drugs keeping body making antibodies vaccine. Vaccines work provoking immune response body, thus generating antibodies. someone drugs, immune system much lower response ""invaders,"" (which context transplant good, want immune system rejecting new organ). hand, immune system reacting vaccine, creating antibodies, thus giving immunity. 
In friend's case, going immunosuppressants allows immune system become sensitive, allows vaccine take effect. And, immune system creating antibodies, stop making/being aware even suppressed again, maintaining immunity (or I've heard). 

Standard disclaimer, neither friend doctors, may gotten details wrong. Wait hear COVID dick... don‚Äôt believe Earth flat 9/11 inside job. tin foil hats here.

This statement jive starting wonder virus made long term goal mind. Winter coming. That's biggest statement ever read.... Yes, testing still alive well.

Spanish Flu killed 50 million people worldwide 675,000 people US 1918 1919. least, according states estimates ranged 17 million 100 million.

Seasonal flu might shit comparison pandemic flu's absolutely compare. fact, part reason COVID deaths lower Spanish flu likely 100 year difference medical understanding.

I thought would excited finally vaccine list get shot breathe sigh relief. I'm beginning wonder wait something better. 

From I've gathered Sinovac vaccine uses dead form virus instead mRNA. Sinovac boost immunity appears quite effective mRNA vaccine, perhaps 60% effective. 

Ya know what, I'd cool knew could get booster shot point road. Google searches yielded little. perhaps someone could fill futures possible I've take Sinovac vaccine.

Yes, still legal still give people medical aid (and insurance) invariably start dying it, society penalized smoking smokers point stands good chance becoming ""exinct"". also completely different situation COVID. Smoking hurts person engaging activity (2nd hand smoke considered) people getting vaccine going fuck EVERYONE. matter time mutation comes around starts killing vaccinated people. Thanks idiots, we're going grab defeat jaws victory. time start thinking Persuasive Means. I'm far expert, watch whole video (no idea Dr. Malone credentials), offhand looks like confusing effects spike protection virus itself, versus part vaccine.

[Studies spike protein creates unique issues part covid, embedded vaccine.

There's fact checks spike protein ""cytotoxic"" (also debunked) seem similar too. simply amazing many DECLINE zero cost vaccine 95% keep dying coronavirus. almost dozen family friends died since January 1st, none vaccinated, dead within 20 days first cough..what wrong people? hate people this. person never got covid-19 first place, they'd still alive! died prematurely. believe long cases, cases offered/not getting vaccine

So think herd immunity away actually well known regular exercise essential healthy immune system laugh whole STATE like 40% vaccinated. 
#floridastrong   still unwell 2 days vaccination visit GP. That's never understood people take seriously. Getting Covid-19 literally playing Russian roulette. I've known multiple people it, including me, none us similar symptoms.

Watching someone actively raised infection chances compared persons went grocery store deemed ‚Äòessential‚Äô forced work, man idk know moral direction it‚Äôs absolute hell watch. Vaccine efficacy typically measured efficacy symptomatic infection, asymptomatic infection. Delta variant, Pfizer (the gold standard) 88% effective symptoms. protection infection (i.e. asymptomatic) probably 70-80%. 

In words, 1 10 vaccinated people exposure event would give sero-naive individual symptoms also get symptoms. 

That said, gets coronavirus risk level flu vaccinated - socially acceptable risk level. flu accepted effective, long-term vaccines like appear SARS-CoV-2. Every death COVID completely preventable one caused entirely stubborn people getting vaccinated and, therefore, achieving herd immunity and, therefore, hurting others process. information this?

If happened before, it‚Äôs definitely within realm possibility.

And think it‚Äôs important acknowledge possibility reality need greater international dialogue safety protocols necessary given happened.

To deny possibility blindly bury heads sand potential dangers another global pandemic. [That's true ""resident demographics"", 70% adults 1

I missed months months period. first period post vaccination two weeks ago.

I‚Äôm sure fertility affected, 33 year old woman actively trying conceive, would also appreciate studies done area.

For record, got two doses moderna. I've seen multiple conspiracy theorists claim Covid survival rate 99.97%. question true, obviously not, get figure from? seem use exactly figure.  even vaccinated people get virus also know whether immunity vaccines long term.

don't think beating current strain covid likely give better immunity getting vaccine made first strain?   Perhaps time invoke American's fondness certain constitutional amendment.

Some things saying make clear. Please listen /u/mikeginnymd saying. achievement. Mind boggling speed organization globally know governments incompetent organizing things.

I'm 6 months work. Hopefully get back August. patient like months ago. 4 months ICU high flow nasal cannula maximal settings. want intubated, would made difference outcome. 

If nasal cannula fell face, realize oxygen saturations would drop 40s minute two. poor nurses pay far attention usual happy hypoxia cannula inevitably become dislodged. 

They want accept reality going get better, finally accept it. Removed supplemental O2 dead within 20 minutes. 

4 months ICU. wish could say unusual. 4 months one longer ones saw lot 2 monthers. true Hospitals first come first serve. 

You clearly dont know hospitals work, understand youre trying argue me. Go watch TV something. also could unlucky soul coincidentally happened express another health issue around time vaccination. Except related COVID, rest body doesn‚Äôt stop whatever would otherwise doing, got vaccinated.

Make appt! I'm Delaware county amazing see single digit cases daily. Happy worst behind us.  I‚Äôd surprised executive order (not law) would withstand judicial scrutiny. likely mutation appear locally compared grown overseas point?

My thought we've done potentially prevent mutations, way really impact sending unused vaccines overseas enforcing rules vaccinations entering country (short really drastic steps like forced vaccinations see happening) Seems pretty easy deprioritize COVID patients then. Afaik, special pools money set aside vaccine injuries. definitely covered.

Seems like you‚Äôre anti-vaxer changing subject tho üòâ Chu can‚Äôt read? No. really concept mRNA vaccines, fall category nucleic acid vaccines. 

The Adenovirus vaccines viral vector vaccines. similar DNA/RNA ones‚Ä¶ use altered viruses meant delivery antigens instead nucleic acids. No, fool. unknown immunity long term. There's cases people getting virus once, could possibly common think. Let‚Äôs fire unvaccinated first responders. public would safer right!? never said oppose it. I‚Äôm it. I‚Äôm saying that, ALSO offer support people harmed vaccines.

If you‚Äôre calling one, calling too.

Why aren‚Äôt you? first good quality image comes search royalty free images 'coronavirus'. Brit making average national wage, straightforward tax situation imaginable, effective tax rate 18%.

Not exactly breaking bank, especially pay health insurance top that.

The idea Brits pay way tax ludicrous, generally very, similar 90% people. family fortune. Insurance companies already starting pull back previous ""we pay full covid treatment"". Prepare GoFundMes bankruptcies. Let‚Äôs separate teams. It‚Äôs worth keeping eye variants even vaccines still mostly protect current ones. Ok, great.

And, feel insurance companies paying anti-Vaxers hospital stays? That‚Äôs we‚Äôre talking here. Sure risk extremely minimal. zero reason life effected. one going lock anything down. 20% peak isn‚Äôt going make dent health care system: easily handle that. know come later?  car crash heart attack get hospital, told ""sorry we're full"" (because Covid) screwed getting idea cut length trial anywhere? I‚Äôve never heard that.

And long term adverse effects pretty much show acutely (I defining within first month last dose) - don‚Äôt see delayed long term effects vaccines - there‚Äôs physical substance cause something like that. Think - would causal mechanism cause side effect five years line? envision working, mechanistically? I'm Brazilian get either. still get many people liked elected, see charisma completely invisible sure anti-viral mechanisms, HEPA filters proven work well covid.

with respect, that's really accurate.
 scientific circles (I'm virologist) terms easily conflated amongst general public, totally true either generally accepted definition amongst variations allow virus spread easily **or make resistant treatments vaccines** variants must monitored carefully.

 Similar 'water resistant' different 'waterproof' 'drop resistant' different drop proof etc, resistant arrest different avoids arrest -- overall suggesting vaccine resistance different suggesting something evade bypass vaccines entirely imply vaccines ineffective. Also given example prior message example covid vaccine failed times specific variant-- see huge disparity AZ measured effects b1351 infection vs D614G (from &lt;30%) - even 'widely understood' definition given would qualify ""vaccine resistant"". goal critique comment sake it- know annoying someone nitpicks comment that's overarchingly true get exactly getting at. agree, think important clear messaging &amp; definitions- one side groups going far fear mongering, side get point might see obfuscation denial science sake positivity. problematic 

It certainly true variants (not strains OP mentioned-- technically covid-19 strains want pedantic!) resistant vaccines others- quite large degree-- (most commonly refers neutralization titre necessarily observable effect efficacy, although two tend go hand hand) stated also true none thus far totally evade vaccines likely remain true, least foreseeable

Better France, UK, Italy sure. yeah, referring anyone could, ears pierced three months, grateful. Mum handled aftercare general maintenance, too. Unbeatable bargain.

AKA likely rude called phonebanking political campaign. Thanks! Russian science always really interesting. It‚Äôs cool bit innovation still uses older vaccine technology, helped many lower-income nations. Sadly seems Russians don‚Äôt really want it. Science changes time.

I remeber az wSnt recommend older people unsure efficiency. Indeed, offered let take part full capacity ‚Äòpilot program‚Äô. 

Fair play him, refused unless entire industry it. 

He made point there‚Äôs months pilots it‚Äôs time open. Yes mix UK. studies look promising Fair enough. One weak spot see logic difference community transmission numbers. vaccinated living area less one case per 100,000 no-need-for-masking territory. One hundred cases per 100,000 different (mainly vaccinated person living contact non-vaccinated immunocompromised persons).

When talk fairness, though, referring condemnation judgment (apparently?) going toward people wearing masks? (Because discussion mask mandates anymore.) people want ""wait Pfizer"", open eligibility Australians who'd rather get AZ wait.

We still get 700k az week made. Lots second doses delivered.    Vaccines much potent weapon fighting epidemics restrictions. gives hope success mRNA vaccines‚Äîas easily quickly adapted/changed effective towards new variants. virus mutates point current vaccine formulation longer effective, expect booster dose matched variant available. expectation probably needed sooner later. Vaccine uptake boosters would likely less original shots (probably similar yearly flu shot uptake), that‚Äôs okay even people don‚Äôt take booster would residual immunity original shot (or subsequent infection, course would milder vaccinated). Eventually, reach sort equilibrium like flu seasonal waves, similar terms impact yearly flu waves. required isolate test positive, otherwise agree. Though considering there's much reason test people vaccinated, guess would qualify extreme circumstance. Hogwash poppycock. No. Serious answer. [you change god omnipotent whatever, means made vaccines. people make rules shit fits want fit.   pandemic experienced year over, America. Yes, anti-vaccine people, zero anytime soon. 

But would ""terrified"" things different last winter?  300 7 day average. feel like way previous US administration largely didn‚Äôt take pandemic seriously first ten months pushed lot countries towards ‚ÄúAny Covid much Covid. need push zero risk/eradication‚Äù mentality. expected rhetoric calm guess it‚Äôs gonna longer thought. 

In reality, life zero risk game. Lockdowns masks/distancing can‚Äôt answer forever, it‚Äôs sustainable. point, life go on, let people make decisions. 

I‚Äôd say already vaccinated don‚Äôt kids 12 unvaccinated high risk people house, go live life best ability. Dibs next good news thread! Well yeah, assumption, I'm eligible Pfizer vaccine issue me, see urged AZ vaccine would worry.

If look statistics here, vaccine little concerning virus. say pro-vaccinator, abides covid restrictions takes seriously. lived somewhere else things would different don't.

In state population around 1.75m. Since beginning covid we've 788 total cases, 601 acquired overseas, staying hotel quarantine negative. We've 4 total deaths. 0.01% chance catching covid locally, smaller chance dying it. stats year covid.

On hand, man's blood clotting case reported ""not unexpected"". health minister tells us expects 1 every 100,000 develop side effect. yet first person did, 150,000 doses given out, taken seriously. sent home tested late died. They've given 150k doses, man died already. short time frame already.

Yes numbers low, seen person near suffer like this, feels real. government decides instead 50s getting AZ, 60s. 60 (my parents included) joke they're expendable Australians worth giving good vaccines, they've gotta take crappy one hope they're 1 100k, they're listened end like man.

As said another comment, understand logic facts. becomes personal close, get head. makes think Hey, wish government said ""yes"" offered large amount vaccine widely considered safe, rather putting eggs basket one could kill parents. I've fair share 'comment battles' self-professed 'high-IQ contrarians' bring 'countless pharma scandals' past 100 years scientifically valid reason disbelieve claims current crop approved covid vaccines - i.e efficacious safe, much safer side effects virus effect.

They'd rather 'sit take ivermectin' , ""definitely must work"" otherwise ""big pharma attack silence it""

Second third infections, even newer variants, less dangerous won‚Äôt escape new COVID flavored cells have. Even virus endemic never going away, won‚Äôt impact infecting unvaccinated people first time.  still June all, give week July article. Sortof. think people 1 dose, Delta variant breaks 1 dose easily.  also think less mrna vaccines, weaker vaccines vs variant perhaps. lot people fully vaccinated, but...it still 45% country CNN yesterday screen, 45% fully vaccinated...so....all unvaxxed...are going ravaged variant here. pretty much way (as seem refuse mask mandates staying home.) Yeah I'm sorry isolated american syndrome. could go center get vaccinated spot like month half Romania vaccinations nearly halted 25% population. idk think america bad worse Obese people don‚Äôt overwhelm healthcare system  numbers referring numbers regarding covid cases. numbers regarding number vaccinations. procedure getting inoculations infrastructure surrounding pretty robust one till now. given India's history vaccinations, believe numbers. look data yet, I'm concerned many states stalling 50-55% vaccination (or lower) less refusal rate. comes vaccinated, matters whether got vaccinated. care half 50% vaccinated actually ""backward anti-vax conservatives"" whatever are, vaccinated, that's counts.

In personal life, know far many people refuse ""guinea pigs"" ""untested vaccine."" Numerous friends, family, even neighbors shared thoughts me. So, I'll let divide us day unacceptable. reason Canada shut far lower threshold cases, hospitalizations deaths healthcare system less able absorb irregularities patient inflow compared US. UK.

Hmm. Yeah. saying making slow recovery, recently transfered hospital rehabilitation center, first round bills totaled $513,000. 18-year-old‚Äôs family friends Las Vegas area started GoFundMe account help medical expenses rare vaccine reaction.

You're gonna work lot harder convince dystopic one demanding condition treated vaccinated workers, yes, onus you.

I also demand 1st responders trained reliable standard actually know treat need services. form somewhere forget fill order guarantee level service? accredited professions professional standards. meet standards, able practice profession. Getting vaccinated professional obligated anyone‚Äôs labor.

Actually, am. 1st providers legally obligated provide duty care. literally utmost best treat times care. get choice. general, statement true, one situations isn't. also obligated, example, labour public defender, require denigrate plague rats.

Knowingly allowing reservoir infectious disease fails standard duty care.

You've got real fucked ideas world, bud. wish trials done would expand allow kids Even that's true. Russia internally?

Its weak, thank god. rollout seems slow b/c citizens hesitant get vaccine. I‚Äôm sorry worried Olympics bringing Covid community get vaccinated gets there. pretty simple. correction. Anvisa analyze samples (they it) discovered it, maximum threshold adenovirus capable replicating openly stated documentation provided developer.

As Slovakia, initially came vague claims ""the provided vaccine match one review based"" admitted issue dosage - Sputnik V originally distributed vials containing 5 doses, shipment sent Slovakia vial containing either 1 2 doses (I remember it). claim ""it math"" technically true, different packaging drugs considered different types reviewed independently, warrant way claims initially made. anything seems political struggle president prime minister. way, eventually approved vaccine Bullshit. USA leading misinformation war. 

Antivax ivermectin everywhere go South Africa. even try blame Russia. R(0) basically assuming one immunity. Effective R would way lower almost countries   mean, look article see ""Against vaccines generally"" still 5% folks ""Won't get plan get it"" (which describe ""unwilling"" phrase think bit aggressive sentence).

And, sure, reasons may fall ""anti-vax"" category well, think two big blue bars do, though. That's specifically vaccine, vaccines. long people getting vaccine. not.
Delta problematic paint it. Please see official numbers UK regarding it. 35 521 infected, non vaccinated ppl UK, 34 died.
India hit hard delta, probably due antibodies (they basically 1-2 wave), big population Airlines reps said mandates remain place children vaccinated. would expect mandates 2022. 

But maybe you‚Äôre planning die 2022, so‚Ä¶ Thank :) Needing find hope live Alpha going extinct pretty quickly Germany.

Nah, Alpha ~89%. Wildtype getting extinct. yes, Delta rising fast. understand Missouri Utah transmission accelerating several poorly vaccinated states, primarily South, young people turning hospitals.

The text, taken article, absolutely true. one two states South seeing small increase hospitalizations. least 8 seeing decrease. Many states better states parts country. article one big lie get clicks. fair, happened 2016... Nice! think first one say thread! long people keep giving upvote dopamine hits.

Don't worry, see too.  wonder regional US versus others (reading article now, may find). US certain areas *really* well vaccinated, others really not. homogeneous places like Germany, France et al?  government numbers demonstrably false disproved start wave, something changed make suddenly realistic? Wtf?

So, trust makes sense us instead actual studies? 

You actually advocating never finding something new.... I'm following UK closely, might peak soon, still early tell. cases increased fivefold since beginning May. Yea, I'm worried kids can't get it. People choose to, zero empathy left. less idiots planet better. put cruise ship Florida ship off. guess answer. question least. :p weird lol live Canada. 

Then talking cross purposes healthcare dystopian nightmare.

The reason Canada shut far lower threshold cases, hospitalizations deaths healthcare system less able absorb irregularities patient inflow compared US. reduces level care public puts onus seek file form prior sort emergency.

You‚Äôre one demanding condition treated vaccinated workers, yes, onus you. don‚Äôt deem worthwhile paperwork ASAP case future emergencies, maybe never important begin like it? freedom choose different career.

Don‚Äôt like it? choose limit receiving treatment vaccinated workers.

You obligated anyone‚Äôs labor. Especially denigrate plague rats. mean India, ""Who wants millionaire"" would ""Who wants lakh-y one""?  say death rate. ?  said less 200 deaths. way population. going 100+ deaths, per day...every day....for months...we 45% fully vaccinated new variant ravages unvaccinated. means 100, 200, maybe even 300 dying per day...for months....betting sites dipping 100, even 1 day, 50/50. 

Not talking rate. UK better mask mandates, many US states 0. higher vax resistance well, worst world Russia. Anti-vaxxers going ravaged Delta variant sadly seeing 100-200 people dying every day...for many months likely... still posting then? Thats astonishing achievement manufacturing logistical perspective.  percentage would unvaccinated individual catching original strain, percentage delta strain? 

Don‚Äôt know would know seem knowledgeable this‚Ä¶ read article? They're talking hospitalizations cases.

Also, one tranch donations one. many others including COVAX. Also, nothing stopping countries going straight AZ, Janssen Pfizer buying more. Plenty people can't get vaccinated, though, including people 11 people countries limited vaccine availability. idea ""vaccines available ME, pandemic over"", prevalent around here, incredibly myopic.

Above though, see issue religion. America exceedingly religious state, remarkably developed world, always radical history certain type religious revivalism. But, regions like Northeast, look like practicing versions developed nations. Religion important people, exists within secularized context, world view. 

In regions, christianity declining places developed western world, less among black hispanic democrats.

I know two latinas get shot, every discussion vaccine, coronavirus, express things get better grace god. turn phrase. indicative. inshallah. world view god center it. providential world view says fate man held palm interceding god, smites gives succor plague.

In deep south, places religion center public life, uptake incredibly low. Science discourse holds sway. Discourses appeal reason hold sway. authority knowledge. Authority gods gods alone. parts USA secular all. hard get places vaccinate primary discourse modern. two sets different civilizations speaking past one another. 

Given historic attitude toward state necessary evil, rather good, lack modern social welfare system trusted regard healthcare, way bridge gap.

Let know trouble set :) ongoing research treatment. Pfizer, one, working pill treat Covid. Also monoclonal antibody treatments. doesn‚Äôt hate people singling unvaccinated they‚Äôre threat healthcare. 

The western world needs pivot better health outcome diet exercise. God help vaccinated Wyoming‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm living short period time due boyfriends job, let tell *cannot wait* live around educated people again‚Ä¶

The reasons I‚Äôve heard people wanting vaccinate straight insanity. anyone reliable source actual Covid data India? government crap numbers something approaching reality? Government responsibility really thing lot parts US. often prefer let free market local governments work, there's centralized booking system many states. offload vaccine responsibility elsewhere, go looking subject inconsistent unintuitive mess. source, straightforward true argument.

In UK, like here, started vaccinating people based age medical history risk virus would protection first. Let's say, example, 30% population. is, someone 30% get infected much likelier serious complications.

At end things 30% mostly complications. mostly younger people also could others preternaturally good fighting disease. 

Right UK 50% fully vaccinated known fully vaccinated confers 90% protection **across entire population**. means average everybody kids, old people, professional athletes, people cystic fibrosis, find protection becoming infected 90%.

But vaccinated population uniform. 30% risk 20% normies. Meanwhile unvaccinated population 20% normies 30% little risk.

Saying ""10% hospitalizations people fully vaccinated"" truthful statement. ignore demographic information, get picture vaccine less effective actually is. because, right now, fully vaccinated population less healthy group people unvaccinated population. math goes

unhealthy + vaccine = 10% hospitalizations

healthy + vaccine = 90% hospitalizations

If vaccine absolutely nothing, expect see far hospitalizations unhealthy group. indeed, exactly see vaccine. People aged 50+ used make 75% hospitalizations. now, despite two groups equal size (50% total), unhealthy one makes 10% hospitalizations protection strong. Brazilian P.1 contagious Alpha, though. u getting ur info free goverment hospitals It‚Äôs additive. we‚Äôre paying lot already obese people doesn‚Äôt make paying Covid hospitalizations better. way prevent this. surprised Russia Today? Yeah Delta going NSW went zero cases 11 like four days.  prove anything reddit. People India paying lot money get vaccinated even readily available. .. mean wish free, isn't. Symptomatic breakthrough infections really rare, know. good news tho? They'll finally get taste fake Covid disease stick libs media hate much. 

On serious note, longer afford worry people's stupidity. 600,000 Americans dead mostly needlessly. I'm beyond giving shit anti vax crowd. reap sow. I'm sorry. difficult see way, I'm sure meant world her. tested, nobody gotten one died it.

It matter mix match. Whether side effects nothing effective vaccine is. said general, younger people experience side effects older people immune systems robust everyone seems different reaction. reaction doses none that's fine. Covid Bolsonaro must best buddies. responsible virus ripping throughout Brazil good trajectory it, wonder variants couple years now.. I'm sure India not, I'll put perspective regardless. central government always serious vaccination drive. 

The first issue vaccine production. easy produce enough vaccines country 1.4 billion. much issue now.

The politics India also pretty grim. State governments different Central Government waste single opportunity mess things centre could blamed. say Centre mess politicians general prioritize fucking public welfare.

The 8 million vaccines today people happy probably pinnacle daily doses delivered. India massive population inept education system riddled people either educated enough understand vaccines life savers straight anti-vaxxers. 

Media cover probably juicy enough push agenda. Like polio vaccination drive, health workers visit villages trying deliver vaccine remotest possible places. come back 1 2 vials consumed straight chased away.

Then people certain community believe COVID vaccines government conspiracy make infertile. Unfortunately, differentiated numbers available public see (mostly one matter).

In conclusion, vaccinating India COVID vaccine going go almost way polio. take ages. Unfortunately, COVID work like polio. Unless major shift morons dealt everyone risk.  Unless conflicting study comes showing Delta significantly resistant current vaccines, pandemic complete vaccinations. changed     Correct.

""What unrefereed preprint?"": I'm pretty sure women giving birth big part play keeping humankind going.

Of course, need things: Women giving birth, men protecting babies. Women can't survive alone wilderness week. Men survive alone, lose live. team, both, men women, die alone cooperating 100%. Women calling male culture ""toxic"" men calling women ""feminazis"" cooperating, result death. logged health care site?

Yeah SK works like that. see vaccinations way back birth.    happening Portugal. Deaths kept constant low single digits (3 yesterday) many cases last months due delta variant. also 95% 60+ vaccinated 50+ dangerous groups taken care  can't fix stupid. says ""game-changer,"" seems like referring landscape pandemic, not....whether get vaccinated gonna lie. 30% seems surprisingly low.

I would expected far higher bump. Yup, anything makes conservatives look bad partisan media dividing people, even accurate picture reality. problem places requiring masks. problem people get vaccinated. Yep, could said obese people costing healthcare fortunes. 

Let‚Äôs hope people get vaccinated let‚Äôs pretend unvaccinated unique causing pressure healthcare systems. data published Monday Public Health England, vaccination Pfizer/BioNTech AstraZeneca effective preventing hospitalisation case Delta variant case Alpha doses Pfizer/BioNTech jab prevent 96 percent hospitalisations due Delta variant, AstraZeneca prevents 92 percent, according study involving 14,000 people.

This first several paragraphs pure scaremongering. Huh 4,000? mom told April 100,000 died vaccine March. friend Facebook never lies totally true.. 53.3% total population partially vaccinated exact. adults (18+), percentage higher 65.4% receiving least one shot. assume that's original commenter referring to, extra 4.6% population still roughly 15.2 million people. Still know people won‚Äôt believe anything unless it‚Äôs researched, peer-reviewed published journal.  I'm sure numbers Russia nothing lack trust government. People love Putin there... odds low. UK AstraZeneca vaccine effective variant, delayed second dose, took long vaccinate young people. age based approach backfires young people go together virus spreads like wildfire. stories care homes quebec heartbreaking infuriating.

Now looming threat Delta resistance 1-doses, Alberta Sask opening fully despite mainly 1-dose vaccinations far.  smart people follow science recommendations dead Republicans? I'm okay that. lot us won‚Äôt double dosed mid-end July, I‚Äôm okay plan get there. Won‚Äôt long now. surrounded career-ending ankle injuries roller derby, similitude felt self-evident early on, properly freaking Quebec's response entirety year. 

We reopened May first lockdown. full month rest Canada, 1/3 Canadian active cases. everyone covered CERB really hurry reopen. pure madness. 

Also, provincial government still recognize role aerosols transmission, like freaking internet capable seeing fully recognizes it. 

Unbelievably enough, vaccination campaign going pretty well. revive 1/1000 Qu√©b√©cois died, but, hey, least seem stopped hemorrhage. may purposeful, shitty manufacturing quality assurance. issue [Brazil's rejection Sputnik back adenovirus supposed replicate, found samples replicating. points really poor QA. One Central European countries also rejected batches Sputnik, labels match expected, knows actually got. Sputnik likely perfectly good vaccine, Russia problems manufacturing scale. We'll still probably manage miss out. Sounds like UK Right. There's better way this. AKA: wearing masks inside wearing outside, like we've doing. need quarantine; damaging mental health. lot misinformation spread past year, we've learned control it.

Main point keep cases controllable, never reach zero. do, numbers game arbritrary. Quarantines worth 10 cases, like Australia doing. know means Wishing good luck (especially given I‚Äôm next province lol)

I personally plan keep masking public I‚Äôm fully vaccinated even though we‚Äôre also dropping mask mandate July 1. Hopefully others squeak everyone get second dose. true? would make like measles, would ripped populations already.

When Wuhan wrecked, claimed RO 3 5 restrictions close 4 5 damage short amount time.

Delta 6.3 10.5 based 110%, 10.5 RO respiratory virus would escape.

I believe infectious tbh, can't be. Wow, 2/3 new cases Europe past 7 days concentrated 3 countries surge covid: Russia / United Kingdom / Portugal

Why 3 vulnerable delta PA's covid site, Deaths recoveries separate categories, would add deaths top recoveries see many active cases are.

This one humans always dumbass humans thing.

My mother fully vaccinated March. According time(Feb-March) literally one coming get vaccine. Part (IMO Justified) fear early roll Indian vaccine, later proved almost effective AZ one. crucial part one taking Vaccine drive seriously, least neighborhood. literally went check heart walked right vaccine area since one showing appointments. 

It May Kumbhmela super spreader happened, people got serious vaccine. mean always center, except weeks(just 25% states, 25% private, 50% center) actual vaccine shortage govt tried paint state governments inability procure.

Now 75% center 25% private think % means it‚Äôs Recovered / ( Total - Deaths )? isn‚Äôt problem recoveries 98% leading negative active cases Although joke, US actually really good team year. Hong Kong BioNTech vaccine (which shipped directly Germany factory) one marketed ""Pfizer"" rest world since Fosun version yet manufactured China.

So best efficacy vaccine.

Yet low vaccination rate number.  That's disappointing. Brain loss sounds kinda bad. Join telegram group Nagpur. accurate helps lot. decides misinformation? good now. 5 million possible July planned 135 million production. need 155 million production July(probably earlier distribution) average level. happy wrong India manages keep pace. 

Still things looking up. hear vaccine hesitancy also much India could see high vaccine rates among adults year over. India good shape hope countries vaccine deprived ramp quickly well.   increased threat mutation negates vaccination concerns me. happened yet, every infection rolls dice natural selection pushing highly resistance variant strain.

I'm enjoying today, keeping look this. Fortunately covid mutates slower say influenza, give enough chances something get through. That's Kashmir, parts Jammu One thing haven‚Äôt seen yet effective natural immunity infection variant. refuse get vaccinated, assume large portion also previously infected. assumption based fact large portion vaccine deniers also refused follow control measures. Feel like summer lulls us false security. Really hoping variants get past vaccines. Feel like game chess, players dumb. really well, PA's Covid site, bump recoveries 98%, state would negative active cases lol. promising, although daily delta variant cases tripled last 3 weeks. death rate increase, we'd see happen week. However given vaccine proved effective hospitalisation, likely see anywhere near increase deaths line case increase.

That said, circulating virus mutate still somewhat concerning global level. post removed cannot verify reliable source. Twitter sources may reliable. possible, please re-submit link reliable source (i.e. news article).

Basically, mental gymnastics. - vaccines easily effective enough suppress Covid, long stop prevaricating get job.  don‚Äôt expect change. stopped watching FIFA events good years back.

Imagine waking every morning convinced half people around Devil incarnate.

What miserable way live.  still requires entire population receive vaccine worldwide. we're still incubating vaccine - resistant strains. Especially India. Zero strong word, mean suppression like measles. say, achieved vaccination - point measles circulates low levels even all. aiming for.

Curfews appear one things cram people together. job fully open states first half June came back LA 15th, official reopening day. Haven‚Äôt worn mask since left airport.

What's statement based on? said, vaccine matter since 100% going mandate entire world get mandatory vaccine. get shot, live life move on! Considering 350 million people America...  every world cup awarded knew it.

i'm sure anyone expected change time. Yeah solution perfect- feel like something whole year think vaccines even ready complicated. Mandating vaccine (or tying large incentive) would eliminate community spread COVID within United States (or developed countries). Alright, I‚Äôm sold. understand restrictions better now. wish messaging government this. useful insights come doctors, many advising govt, rather actual govt  anecdotal evidence research back up?

I'm talking ""You come negative Covid test"", ""Pls voluntarily quarantine accommodation"", etc. bullshit. No, simply travel coming places (with exception freight). Want still let people limited scope (nationals returning abroad, business propose, etc.)? Fine, forced quarantine 2 weeks coming hot spot. per country bases, EU level. would required European leaders agree unified response pandemic. Something failed every turn since start pandemic.

It baffling European institutions, who's principal role facilitate European trade (internally externally), done shit job protecting European economy. internal borders go (which 100% agree, thing past), fkn enforce stuff external border. thought pandemic going great showcase European project. would show solidary, unified centralized response would much better job protecting citizens economy every member state YOLO'ing it. even try.. Gloves shoes hands. don‚Äôt give shit well being, might infect others, might cause mutation. whole point get fast possible. That‚Äôs everyone making personal sacrifices done year. 

Ask yourself, want live world even damaged COVID?

This really difficult. Get vaccinated. children aren‚Äôt eligible vaccine? get ounce sympathy you?  Yes, profit us hospitals absolutely loved stop elective surgeries measly $3800 Depends rationale refusal?

Unfortunately, neighboring state one ones super low vaccine rate. anyone's guess that's going work fall. past year Michigan kinds weird. 

First attempt kidnap governor, highest Covid rates nation one point, election getting heated AF (cities straight blue rural counties Trumptopia). Metro Detroit strange vaccine statistics suburbs mostly vaccinated, rural counties plus city Detroit lag far behind. wonder many underlying pre-existing health issues had.

Say get 1st 2nd dose side effects anything fine, mean weak immune system? probably counting snowbirds got thier shots went home. still antibodies, take vaccine best wasted, worst cause autoimmune condition common younger people known cytokine storm. think recent evolution recent discovery. likely ability along. even postulated could 10-25x official one estimates vary lot. I'm sorry go that. Sending internet stranger hugs. Oh yeah course, know people say kind thing. see lot!

Some people addicted spreading misinformation.  Could Monsoon season starting everyone stuck indoors socialising travelling moment.

The massive drop new cases India literally coincides first rains. Italy stop administering AstraZeneca‚Äôs Covid vaccine people age 60, Italian government announced Friday, amid drop country‚Äôs level infections meant risks distributing vaccine younger people judged outweigh AstraZeneca vaccine scrutiny smattering reports rare severe blood clots received vaccine emerged Younger Italians already received one dose AstraZeneca vaccine get different shot booster dose, said Francesco Paolo Figliuolo, army general charge Italy‚Äôs vaccination effort, news conference. added change would minimal impact country‚Äôs vaccination rollout. wonder there's studies done trust media various countries vs vaccine hesitancies?

Because people reason distust information they're getting regular basis, perhaps could reason distrust vaccines .. baby staggered shots. really big deal unless trust husband look little one, much bigger problem. drop bucket Africa alone one billion people. Asia one billion people South America nearly half billion folks. 55 million doses going do? ramping production? people ""rural"" areas easy vaccine access. Rural rarely ""living farm 50 miles nearest town"".

Its mostly people 1-10k communities hospitals clinics. use comma it.

Can't express situation feels like see cases. Hope God look children give us brave courage adopt help them.  Connecticut, example, am, shows upsurge infection, Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas, Missouri show substantial upsurges infections. That‚Äôs based entirely much population-wide immunity based vaccination,‚Äù Gottlieb said CBS‚Äôs ‚ÄúFace Nation‚Äù program.

Maybe sees South getting hot fall?  narrative would change it‚Äôs ‚Äúconspiracy‚Äù

If FDA approved vaccine view encouraging people get it, suggested comment responding, narrative would correct. vaccine would FDA approved sociopolitical reasons scientific ones; effect, conspiracy.  Hundreds kids died Covid. know sure one died vaccine? exactly wrote above... never said people stay home, travel abroad. Premier Gladys Berejiklian said ""in likelihood"" requirements mask-wearing continue past Thursday.  means masks indoors public transport, number different public indoor settings specific LGAs.

Yeah sounds really terrible. wear masks indoors places‚Ä¶ several states (Mississippi, West Virginia, California, New York, Maine, Connecticut) exemption childhood vaccination based religious personal beliefs. Medical exemptions allowed course, states require independent review addition doctor's recommendation (to avoid doc shopping). 

While suppose required sense attend public, private, home school community-augmented programs need get vaccinated, tiny sliver. Hence states 99%+ childhood vaccination rates. 

While states limit authority childhood vaccinations we've eliminated scarier diseases like smallpox, States requiring vaccinations settled law. settled century Jacobson v. Massachusetts Supreme Court case 1905. issue young people won‚Äôt vaccinated Ireland summer. EU rules however allow travel within EU long show negative test result. Nothing.

Some people, get oxygen demands something send home on. Around 3 liters per minute. installed home get oxygen tanks delivered home regularly. That's common practice anybody respiratory failure looks like take long time recover never recover.

But long termers ICU? maximized high flow O2. We're talking 100 liters 100% O2. Atmosphere O2 \~40%, require double O2 air breathing right they're requiring 100 liters per minute. variation high flow (20L-100L, 40%-100%) absolutely unavailable home environment.

Sort like immune system getting two slightly different looks virus - analogy used front view side view like mug shot.  Including eligible vaccine due age reasons, yes. south africa variant (is gamma beta?) mRNA vaccines?

I think I'm concerned delta is, yet again, deadlier transmissable. virus evidently evolving get worse worse. I'm sure right, eventually vaccine efficacy slip important anymore. remain unconvinced booster help time matter. fully expect fiddle fuck around year variant booster start giving us plebs.

But think good news took 18 months (our vaccines wild type) go 95+% efficacy 88%. it'll probably another year see scary levels escape. Probably. Oh see. 

Yeah, we‚Äôve told alert ‚Äúunusual‚Äù symptoms. obviously chronic cough wouldn‚Äôt get tested normal coughing, developed different symptom WOULD get tested.

Stay safe. Lloyd Webber, said would open theatres regardless, he‚Äôs happy go court protest.

He's also Lord large Tory donor somewhat doubt he'd treated harshly. vaccines still work. winter I'd expect almost everyone vaccinated.

I really understand reasoning behind lockdowns, say reduced immunity normal flu etc. seasonal vaccines vulnerable population like every year pre-covid.  85% Japanese citizens polled want olympics held crisis.

Nearly every Japanese medical association asked Olympic Games postponed cancelled.

.Japan‚Äòs vaccine rollout slow/delayed compared rest happy overseas fans banned, Japan avoid potential incoming covid threats.

Nearly every Covid variant community spread levels Japan. government scapegoating foreigners way selling ‚Äúsafe‚Äù games be, Covid doesn‚Äôt work way.

By way, feel even cold sixteen months silver lining social distancing masking. Title good chuckle.

Next up‚Ä¶ whippersnappers  Covering eyes huge sun glasses perfectly fine. Alberta they‚Äôre even giving second doses AZ. They‚Äôre recommending people get mRNA vaccine second Question is: many countries accept unvaccinated without quarantining period time? 

It‚Äôs less hassle get vaccinated plan travel. Yes issue always ordering enough doses last year. Lol what? That's vaccines work all. think vaccines stay body life? Indonesia Philippines receiving Pfizer vaccines August also realize everyone 12 can't get vaccinated yet, right?

It's anti-vaxxers risk. deal here, AZ first Pfizer second Canada. Day second shot felt like crap, glad made sure day off. understanding though PCR test looks traces coronavirus RNA though. mRNA specifically uses trigger immune response. No, state never really went complete lockdown. numbers falling rapidly nonetheless understanding though PCR test looks traces coronavirus RNA though. mRNA specifically uses trigger immune response. Varies. I've seen young 30 health problems old 90. I'd say I've seen people around 60 though. part psychology. people (older) ready say ""this it, I've long life"" much quicker pull plug themselves. People denial high hopes recovery despite evidence otherwise ones stay ICU longterm, wait come decision own. lot people, thing that's usually really bad lungs COVID, that's able survive long. Unfortunately, lungs shot zero chance recovery. Yup required... AZ boosts T-Cell response mRNA boosts B-Cell response. Win-win.

[Nerdy It‚Äôs eased states now. places hypothesised reached herd immunity, it‚Äôs hard say conclusively. New Delhi example, sero survey done January (before vaccinations started deadly second wave occurred) showed 54% people Covid antibodies. Right now, things open reported 89 cases last 24 hours (population 20 million). Still unproven unreliable. wait hear vaccinations required kids. It'll blow mind. got AZ/Pfizer combo Canada. side effect sore shoulder. supply issues us I've read. 

There poor messaging Federal officials too. that's sad frustrating  real world data came numbers became alarming. get second dose Moderna Pfiser tho... addition everyone else said, UK use euros.  spread world already matter?

If one, insurance companies cover one. Appalling. people assholes. many there? mention even literally everything transplant goes hunky dory, a-okay, sunshine roses, best possibly could.

You're still immune-suppressant drugs remainder life. Meaning immune system never strong pre-transplant. US refusing anyone AZ. private institutions accepting them.

Not ICU though.  Screw that.  hate hospitals. UK super relaxed rules international travellers.

Yes, however, outside extraordinary circumstances one. certainly, tell, makes life difficult. Incentives entirely different story, things like providing financial incentive get vaccinated (like many companies smoke) seems pretty uncontroversial.

I think going sit panic variants, best turning concern countries able vaccinate many yet. US ~11k cases per day (and falling) - true many countries vaccines infrastructure vaccinate, many years come. They're going main risk (and fortunately, there's evidence yet variant escapes immunity significant way even *possible*). definitely believe you. opinion, believe good thing body sick every while. someone get sick long time, that's actually cause concern. Team Variant coming wood work last days field day. usually completely blow idea vaccines still protecting delta variant.  People always think COVID seasonal. Surprise: Brazil showed perfectly create wave summer fine.

What matter social distancing masks. lockdowns. 
My city lockdown year. People care anymore virus either.  
Result: year daily 10-15 deaths. there's ""wave"".  Oh yeah believe 100%. I‚Äôve worked COVID patients requiring ECMO we‚Äôve many young people die deemed unacceptable transplant. recently lungs one one guy 40s finally weaned ventilator. yeah many others lucky :( Maybe small segment. However, personally know many men legitimate concern this. study nothing positive news vaccine rollout promoted such. Looks DFW area, fucked even 2 Pfizer doses.( county 44% single dose) get it, know many people thought people either one side other, truth people gotten vaccinated yet *some* reason haven't. possible use leverage towards side getting vaccinated. Particularly ""reasons"" actual propaganda, old misinformation.

Just really easy example, CDC one point advising people get vaccinated within 90 days covid-19 infection.

People Covid heard never heard new reverse decision ""people *with active* Covid get vaccinated positive people coming vaccination centers, soon Isolation get vaccinated"". Others conflated ""people received monoclonal antibody treatment get vaccinated 90 days that"". 

I think overall needs understood, somewhat self protection mechanism trying circumvent, way discussion, honesty, currently known facts, dismissal. Thats gets nobody vaccinated, go big vax sites, maybe talk doctor. 

That know *NO* medical reason anybody get vaccinated, outside 12 right now.

According CDC, Covid 1.4% chance killing you‚Äôre 55-64. 2.7% you‚Äôre 65-74, etc.
According CDC, vaccines given adverse reactions 5 every million doses given, 0.0005%.
It really comes math. It‚Äôs simple. 2800x likely die Covid vaccine you‚Äôre 55-64, 5400x you‚Äôre 65-74, vaccine available every adult 2 months now, yet still wear mask airplane. get vaccinated done shit. patients got COVID long time ago family members say used real sharp slow, easily confused, forgetful, poor attention spans. call COVID brain. try

It might Spike protein vaccines target defense mechanism virus.

With specific genes, might set Alzheimer disease lookalike, happens much faster pace it.

Right now, vaccine lowest damage possible, virus going away, mutates rapidly.

Mind you, plenty non-Covid ICU cases. still 5 ICU holds ER left. There‚Äôs unit hospital fully staff. true area hospitals. ER half staff January 2020. two month break, that‚Äôs over. also refusing Covid admits outlying hospitals can‚Äôt handle have.  Good know! Possibly, probably not. case expect much lower degree, all. Great work. Keep up! Target 8 million lets gooo!!! sure risks second shot AZ, risks first shot far higher that. vaccine available everyone since mid-April. It‚Äôs mid-June.

I don‚Äôt know state, mine mega-site thing walk-in vaccinations appointment needed. far I‚Äôm aware, vaccine also available CVS Walgreens.

So that‚Äôs eight weeks. Eight sets days off. Eight new work schedules. Eight sets chances get vaccine.

If someone exists circumstances doesn‚Äôt get vaccine, don‚Äôt want vaccine saying do. seems combination two different vaccines gives better immunity either vaccine (after two doses). could multiple reasons, one may two similar different aggressors system makes immune system respond strongly due unrecognized. 

AZ viral vector vaccines disadvantage second dose, body recognize ‚Äúcarrier‚Äù virus (the dead virus covid proteins attached) kill vaccine replicate spike proteins. means second dose AZ often less effective, believed many reason waiting longer AZ doses gives better immunity, body forgets carrier virus time COVID. 

The Russian Sputnik vaccine also viral vector vaccine, it‚Äôs special second dose uses different viral vector. prevents aforementioned second dose issue, believed Sputnik close mRNA‚Äôs effectiveness.

Complications based official data 1 million event. actually state way article implies. read thread there's context given quote. government messaging AZ always safe, adverse reactions exceedingly rare? kind messaging putting forward? takes longer build immunity shot

I want highlight US decided fully vaccinated 2 weeks receiving J&amp;J, pretty clear clinical trial data efficacy continues increasing least 5-6 weeks shot - like waiting two weeks dose 2 mRNA vaccine. concerned less effective makes sense continue taking extra precautions 5-6 weeks, 2. 

But beyond that, choice J&amp;J Pfizer sometime distant future, get J&amp;J now! good vaccine. Maybe absolute best 95% effective preventing serious cases/hospitalization absolutely worth it, IMHO. end needing boosters variants anyway get mRNA vaccine then. It‚Äôs entirely frustrating 25yo would like get vaccinated literally can‚Äôt, idgaf boomers say vaccine hesitancy believe Murdoch media (90% media) I‚Äôd rather get fully vaccinated worry (at least until/if vaccine resistant COVID hits) Judging past year half they'll come something maximize misery inconvenience they'll try sell ""normal"". Oh, something working they'll quadruple-down pretend is. Maybe LNP Coalition accepted offer 40 million doses Pfizer instead doubling Astrazeneca, Australia terrible position. Depends region. Many states northeast either pushing 80%. south, much.

The country whole also well 50% - believe crossed 60%.  get mine today. Five weeks first. (Re-scheduled September). happy!  states rural many counties even doctors them. 

Before shit people realize much places like Eastern Oregon nearest pharmacy 60+ miles away. authorities shit. another event like 9/11. lets invade China time?? original trials 12 week wait. something done later make vaccine available people first dose. there's widespread vaccination COVID eradicated nearly eradicated... curtains anti-vax movement. would clear profound elimination threat we've deal trust given science informed health policy. happens, essential oils crowd loses space control narrative vaccination. Covid never going away. Governments going adapt point decide acceptable level infection zero Covid isn‚Äôt feasible. Doubt it. Canada draconian US now. really worry vaccine. single dose mRNA least effective J&amp;J dose, it'll make eligible booster whenever get chance. Go closest place vaccinate state people.   seems like catching covid second time rare. link mentioned 12 people recovered covid-19, 5 caught disease later outbreak. Also second times usually severe first.

This also seems support claim mRNA vaccines either pfizer-biontech moderna provide even better protection actually catch disease, especially older people. Find local vaccine hunting group (probably inactive now) ask there. Unless already got spread among themselves, seeing lot of. Yes, not? potent enough surpass vaccine expect also fatal? sure this.

If vaccinate disproportionately good spreading virus leave bad spread recovered immunity, could stop quickly. children 12 immunocompromised. That's reason enough care. Vienna right? upper Austria problem get Pfizer shot 12+ short notice (aka days). get shot somewhere else. instance registered secondary location, might even apply elderly parents living outside Vienna that's vague guess. Nah, enjoy picking apart logical fallacies, hobby mine. nothing left, unlike you, mean say done dealing you. Bye Felicia! experts even think possible? Like ever observed virus ever? mind cautious seems bit alarmist. Oh see, thanks sharing think safe.How expensive vaccine took? Jamie Metzl Joe Rogan show talking lab leak theory sounds credible, done purpose happened accident protocols followed way supposed be. highly recommend watch vid. mRNA-vaccinated there's really, really, really low risk young people infecting elders. young, getting vaccinated everything need end pandemic. Stop worrying masks (do comfortable with) spend extra effort convincing friend vaccinate. 

(There weaker vaccines outside US/EU though masking still makes sense another booster.) like going parties, amusement parks, concerts, conventions, etc. like socializing places socializing.

I literally *never* want ‚Äúsocialize‚Äù randos store, street, public transport I‚Äôm going business.  That's exactly like talking previously sane mother. Thank god still hates Trump.  Fewer auto accidents make sense, suicides too? people always citing mental health issues domestic abuse justification reopening? would've thought suicides would well? know compute likelihood virus came from, maybe debate virus came from. I'm still happy first marriage BTW. Bonus points, PhD molecular biology, still really cute sweet. actually got see real scientists talk findings Zoom conferences. happened dad. got covid twice... first one mild. Second one got seriously ill.

He died taking ventilator thinking ok. tried resuscitation while...

But unlike you, found pregnant couldn‚Äôt hospital anymore. 

I always feel guilty this. Probably also makes things worse lowering humidity, supposed increase airborne transmission. That's exactly would say. propose hypothesis, make predictions would follow true also look things would falsify it. Best luck recovery keep expended effort within medically advised guidelines. people Long Covid seem go periods seems get better overdo end setback. highly organized. take appointment online, turn efficient operation, check id, vaccine you, wait fifteen minutes case. Whole thing takes twenty minutes max! 

What like USA Saved click: 12-15 year olds. I‚Äôm antisocial like another accessory match outfits  vape Dad dips. stepmom got covid Dad slept bed couple days convinced quarantine. couldn‚Äôt really quarantine either stay home. Neither dad got sick we‚Äôve negative multiple tests stepmom still tests positive symptoms 2 months later. 

It could also vitamin thing stepmom tan skin white. family got sick claim didn‚Äôt get sick white lot white friends didn‚Äôt get sick. 


Could also genetic thing mom extended family got covid felt little tired. Maybe it‚Äôs coincidence luck could factors told rich grifters would tank economy, steal people's homes, destroy middle class, one would go jail it, I'd said country would react next 8 years way Germany 1930s.

Either liberal democracy debate good faith find best way run society everyone follow pretty words power serves power. America needs make choice fewer people willing sit fence anymore.   Nah, ignorance display, that's problem. Cheers.  know anyone support Brazil's president. Prevents dying covid.

Stop shitting pool ideas giving cop uncertainty.  True know nothing life like Australia thankyou friend  yoy evidence UK even got directly India? 

And evidence 1 seeding vs. Lots different places? need convince others dont feel like crazy ones. know minority Australia feed international antivax groups. Ive called response tends be...
Post FB links tests arnt effective, post fake mortality rates virus vaccines ask 'ingredients' them. Completely ignorant statement. Australia zero COVID strategy, regularly lock kill virus transmission go back regular life. lockdowns remarkably effective usually short. really hope so. We're late vaccinations (45% one jab, 25% fully vaccinated) expecting reach 70% one jab August 70% fully vaccinated October. Fortunately, anti vaxxers huge concern Portugal. 90% population wants get vaccinated.

I know virus circulate change, like coronavirus do. said, manageable. think positive message missing. one famous expert saying months now, saying covid become endemic smaller waves, kinda like flu. Mask wearing indoors fall winter advised, things fairly normal. However expert one versus dozens keep saying we're doomed lol  title descriptive it‚Äôs paywalled. numbers, barring expected discrepancy, correct. Weird. almost like vaccines work.  Czech Republic allowed foreigners private insurance get vaccinated... 810 Kƒç (~40 USD) per shot. blows mind 1) waited long even *allow* 2) making tens thousands people pay vaccine described time time way this

And Czech Republic one highest deaths per capita rate, truly give fuck  actually surprised past week UK cases seem leveled around 9000 10000 cases. Obviously, could change, rolling average leveled now. I‚Äôm opinion US extremely irresponsible we‚Äôre going pay months. I‚Äôd get used researcher noting, it‚Äôs reality awful virus. fair, level seroprevalence shown sero surveys conducted India shows lot people infection acquired antibodies would probably start seeing herd immunity effects long everyone vaccinated Actually want job want hang friends. poor. needs met ok. miss going fun stuff friends. 64 retired. Last year worked part time could afford car. car less really need one here.  None peers, experience, actively use facebook. likely parent‚Äôs influence. friends conservative families don‚Äôt want take vaccine vice versa already gotten theirs.

That number high. large percentage 20% convinced. many 20% take kids get annual shots, accept flu shot happen Dr's office fall. typical anti-vax nutjobs think cause autism. Pretty sure pope tried this. P0liti.cs god. P0litic.s country. There‚Äôs hope people.  doubling time UK 2 weeks. Say let 4 rather 16 cases that's 4 weeks grace. amount time we've postponed final opening step by. course. U.S. also full stupid people world.  terms cases though, UK 1/5 population US roughly, 11,000 cases US vs. 10,000 UK isn‚Äôt fair comparison   Lol I‚Äôm putting one back sorry. I‚Äôm done it.  Yeah that's hard tell. least variant (Gamma think?) terribly contagious. Source: ass.

AZ 92% effective serious hot cop/trooper friends denial side beginning.  remember one early telling everyone would listen professional opinion whole things BS worked EMTs hospitals weren‚Äôt full. really using AZ Pfizer. Pfizer Moderna like 90% vaccination shots US  dramatic üôÑ  population vaccinated nothing 

25% enough stop Delta variant, true. 70% be.
It important push threshold. Many states US reach it, others won‚Äôt. countries worldwide. expect see Fall wave would inversely proportional vaccination rate. 

That expert correct COVID going away properly ever, goal high vaccination rate limit impact healthcare system (and death toll) comparable less flu every year. High vaccination rate even vaccines 100% effective. Look Missouri, good trend. think foolish think get impacted delta variant. question timing, regional vaccination stats. That‚Äôs Bondii outbreak. you‚Äôre right people died, might lockdown.  7 day rolling average. UK much higher vaccination rate?  thought younger people would willing get vaccine. 

 still understand someone want take vaccine prevents getting sick. Facebook truly terrible resource. Maybe similar, definitely less Alpha would predominant Brazil. see vaccinating rapidly? see OWID vaccinating 1.22 million people per day average last 7 days (assuming talking this).

Edit: looking southern states individually, I‚Äôm confident say article‚Äôs headline full üí© US Government talking prevent spread delta variant one issue time there? Oh, absolutely. exhausting serious roadblock convincing - least they're wearing masks, going except groceries, likely convinced (I feel like) people actively *identify* anti-vax. Sincerely, Alabama. Gamma variant America Alpha variant still prevalent variant next OG.  Congrats communities high numbers, there‚Äôs world outside suburb unless never venture outside borders.  Simply get vaccinated risk new variant. I‚Äôm safe, family safe, we‚Äôll see happens anti-Vaxers get wiped one said aim keep COMPLETELY.

Just reduce amount seeding give vaccines time. Many countries know vaccines work becuase habe seen recently. America decades removed generations removed polio, small pox, yellow fever Vax showing effectiveness.  It'll hard lesson many learn.  ourworldindata, Israel delivered least 1 dose 64% population 2 doses 59%. Total doses delivered would somewhere around 11 million (a little maybe, rough numbers). today counted, India delivers numbers every 2 days. long moving average used, every 4 days still.

If comparison, make much sense. take numbers consideration actual population, per capita income, etc. P.1 predominant Brazil? 90%~. Brazil basically travel restrictions.  
There Alpha variant confirmed Brazil months. grow.  
P.1 2.4x transmissible previous strain. far know, B.1.1.7 1.7x transmissible.  Whodathunk? Russia exporting ton misinformation social media countries, particularly vaccines. I‚Äôm loss topics well. almost driven mad throughout entire pandemic. smells corruption me. Thank reply. really hard mentally deal everything here. Portuguese experts seem concerned creating scariest headlines pass information. Sadly, government restrictions way harder countries looking like hardened next weeks. idea able see family again, live far them. try live life much I'm allowed, said Yeah, doubt. second dose invite due mid-July, I'm outta here.  That‚Äôs hard me. live Canada. Liability issue healthcare dystopian nightmare. However, US, insurance companies forced pay complications. Even person covered, insurance companies cover bill given US gov paying vaccine first place save insurance companies billions possible solution fear (while respecting body autonomy parties involved) would first responder facilities offer kind legal form people share fears sign wish receive treatment, even emergency life saving treatment, anyone proven vaccinated.

No. reduces level care public puts onus seek file form prior sort emergency. Effectively zero people use it. best option make employment contingent getting vaccinated. can't reasonably first responder putting patients risk. like it? freedom choose different career. middleground I'd okay unvaccinated responders liable infections might traced back them. Another option daily rapid pcr testing choose stay unvaccinated whenever comes positive get sent home get paid. 33% immune response, 33% terms real-world effectiveness? family member anything like people life typically describe ""hippies"" exactly pro-science folks essential oils, Himalayan salt lamps, weed/CBD cure literally everything.  Sterilizing immunity means cannot get infected. current generation vaccines conferred it, would breakthrough cases. There's chance vaccine intranasal delivery would trick, due mucosal immune response. Well, yeah, always.

**TL, DR:** much evolutionary pressure towards milder disease spread asymptomatically presymptomatically.

The evolutionary pressure obviously, definition, higher transmission. many viruses, carrier contagious they're symptomatic, symptoms severe they're going interact people much. Hence case less severe symptoms lead greater transmission.

But problem coronavirus carrier contagious showing symptoms. get symptoms, may self isolate, virus spread onwards. self isolating symptoms, bad symptoms turn really make much difference transmission virus. makes happy India, rest world too.  Touch√© choke Kinder Egg deny virus satisfaction getting kill. good test see good Pfizer holds variants.

Maybe series needles, weeks apart. 

Hmm. One positive articles posted amongst shitstorm world ending delta variant articles posted last week zero comments. surprised sub? extreme. vaccines work phenomenally well - much better anyone even hoped.

At end day, life zero risk game. millions risks pathogens covid, continue after. Live life. Interesting. country organized priority groups. Would've huge scandal people could pay get shot earlier. guy alot underlying health issues. seems pretty clear hit hardest either underlying issues/are elderly/are overweight athletes killing gym/with heavy cardio makes thems vulnerable.

Pretty much everyone outside groups fine.
It still course everyone's duty get vaccinated whether fit groups benefit others.  would count either. Tegnell thought summer 2020 expect second wave hitting Sweden despite warnings. Boy wrong. Thing people like infected potentially deadly disease take precautions hand government fails.  thread bit terrifying, I've read bit him. Thanks letting us know.

I really need stay sub while. like rollercoaster sometimes. Exactly. people say ‚Äústarting rise‚Äù seen nothing falling metrics continued nationally. US CARES act pay covid related hospitalization. potential bad effects death. Read article - talks evidence brain tissue changes caused covid, including mild asymptomatic cases. monitoring (and Soviet times) achieved peers. law enforcement institutions naturally enough enough manpower watch everybody, one two people in, say, work collective, listen report go long way. Also, highly ideological person report somebody saying anti-government things volition, requires strong state ideology. SII Bharat Biotech requesting funds government expand manufacturing capacity government dragging feat. Government injected capital April end second wave wrecking heavoc caught pants down. agree absurd compare India US Europe due difference Per Capita income, government sure screwed tens thousands could've saved proactive. OP replied answered chosen ignore them

Huh, where? talking about? double checked nobody replied except you.

As rest comment, entire point contention point things would better Central Government taken distribution day 1, Central Government good job procurement not. repeatedly said think would made much, difference distribution Central Govt beginning since problem India's lagging vaccination rates beginning distribution availability vaccines. know seem ignore I'm actually saying keep arguing something else. know we've saying since last year, what's interesting (well, shitty) none major variants seem appreciable fall-off disease severity. major variants became contagious thus far also bad worse wild-type strain terms symptom presentation serious outcomes.

It'd nice countervailing evidence variants like Delta spread faster markedly less dangerous, virus far materialized negative piece prediction (faster spread) positive one (less virulent).    Israel reached 80% long long time ago.  Assume want, conclusion wrong. defend Russia per se, simply correct information (intentionally not) rarely twisted people reddit media. respond baseless criticism Sputnik V, would respond baseless criticism vaccine, knew comments wrong. living country (or sufficient knowledge) would same. way, think got argument safety Chinese vaccines.

P.S.

What posts anything? everyone family recovered? vaccinate vulnerable death rate drops dramatically. Far distribution, got start somewhere. Production ramping fast manufacturers manage. difficult shortage feed stocks, equipment, skilled technicians. time every dose made needs known safe effective. standard two-jab AZ, combining one jab Pfizer? would two Pfizer jabs better? like would lock entire state least next 2 weeks. check live data? Yes. global pandemic. everybody's problem. nope fucking predatory misleading media, vultures OP replied answered chosen ignore them. central government magic wand create vaccines nothing. US monopoly vaccine orders, huge struggle get IP vaccines released India, deliberate hoarding vaccines raw materials US. himalayan task easy feat trying manufacturer well vaccinate near billion people  8 Genocides 

Not hyperbole *at all*. media would believe half country backward anti-vax conservatives, simply case.

Oh yeah, ""the media's"" fault. Sounds familiar. guess sarcasm.

But aside, Canada Day July 1st, bit lousy anyone travelling advance. again, one's supposed left unless essential reasons, much matter. government hospitals would give free , usually crowded takes time could get relatively less crowded , well managed place paying.  Weird. original answer post (really long) seems vanished. get chance read it? cheers! I‚Äôm Germany 1st dose AZ. Exactly 12 weeks later got 2nd dose BioNTech/Pfizer. AZ knocked two days, BioNTech side-effect all. 

German studies found stretching time mixed jabs 9-12 weeks reduces strength side-effects improves count antibodies T-cell response even Pfizer/Pfizer-levels. originate China... countries: ‚ÄúAside U.S., Dutch government added **Albania, Lebanon, North Macedonia, Serbia, Taiwan** list safe countries outside EU Schengen area.‚Äù true. Literally. federal booking website (which states use others don't) used mobile phone, uses OTP-system via SMS.

That obstacle forced massive number people needlessly phone hotline, constantly overwhelmed proved significant bottleneck entire vaccination process. Sir, wdym, I'm J&amp;K well complete lockdown time 2nd wave. thread posted Eric Fiegl Ding one biggest misinformation spreaders Twitter. take says seriously. I'm Nagpur trying get vaccinated since jan. still bad here. tell get apart online sites. Something red something orange. Gotta think real hard now... good job limiting spread. People tend wear masks self isolate without making everything themselves. still took little month make work. busy get Covid? she'll get eventually... ontario? Yea GOP did. Interesting! 

So - paying it, would mean people money could get faster free hospitals? 

I‚Äôm confused get free wouldn‚Äôt make free everyone! Holy crap. Excellent news!

Kick virus' ass! Ughhh even say loud. so? chart shows vaccine hesitancy astonishingly low. No, **very** 'helpful. helpful us would like. Take case Astra-Zeneca vaccine received adverse news efficacy, especially regards variants. less effective, firm numbers yet known. simplicity's sake - understand *not* saying verified number - let's say 50% less effective. Suppose hobby blindly running across road. suppose device practice reduced chances clobbered car truck 50%. fool snap help. greater fool argue halving chances death ""isn't helpful"".   Yeesh. nothing else, deal people long term. ordering earlier taking delivery vaccines government would freed warehouse space SII? allowed scale earlier

Where say article? Stockpiling limitations doses expiration dates piling endlessly best idea either. 

Every single vaccine manufacturer planet plagued production difficulties despite billions committed orders almost year now, there's physical limit everything.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 Please see delivery issues nations EU faced well Canada, NZ, Aus etc. nations West 3-5X vax doses order citizens still face delivery delays. Makes wonder... maybe wanted father dead?

There psychopaths wants that... terrifies lot.

Because insanity... pure evil them. Im sure Im following. So, vaccine immune variant emerge, shouldnt quarantine? i'm anti-vaxxer remember kind brain loss! (/s, obviously) Good point. assuming adults, sure kids involved outbreak. Anyway, use 60% vaccinated, get 460 infections 90% efficacy 520 80%, would 13 26% vaccinated, respectively. Let efficacy 80%, still nothing worry about. Spoiler alert: never end!&lt; Well bless heart! Bless hearts I'm fully vaccinated since February, please take wrong way pro-vax gets, rhetoric around Delta variant ridiculous. zero peer reviewed data dangerous affects young people higher rate. increase deaths UK increase total cases US. Cases plunging India. media great time freaking everyone out, though. Bruh hear, y'all lockdown since much covid Want back? Y'all back. :)   stupid cause fully vaccinated people still show covid asymptomatic spreading virus cause got tiny amount virus system... possibility, paraphrasing tweet read last week, viruses spread humans zoonosis lab leaks. continuous destruction invasion ecosystems makes sure continue encounter novel viruses. lots people countries get news Russia social media? Good NM. Montana here, wear mask yer lib vaccinated, dont wear mask ""mah freedumb"". State legislature Governor enacted new law actually prevent local health offices enacting covid protocalls. County health officials saying new law invalidates local health codes. Restaurants, bars, even sanitation local requirements. nuts. Blind patriotism libertarian fetishism take India people Billion number people US. US full folks buy conspiracies little thought. month 2021, said manufactured 70 million shots company uncertain would receive license India didn‚Äôt enough warehouse space‚Äù

Surely ordering earlier taking delivery vaccines government would freed warehouse space SII? allowed scale earlier Yes Netherlands one them, fucking annoying too!  Hope keep 8-9 millions jabs everyday foreseeable future. also eradicated Rinderpest, affected cattle humans.

And well way eradicating Measles, fuck Andrew Wakefield.  countries use (.) place ( ,) number system Govt targetting 10 million daily doses mid July. Yeah no. one vaccine maker said issue. issue scaling production Switzerland (which contracts) it‚Äòs roughly 70% Moderna 30% Pfizer. Another well duh study. next one going ""recent weddings giving high transmission""? likely true considering India one best vaccination routes setup. countries long history mass scale vaccinations. Eg - TB vaccine, Polio vaccine etc. entire system really vast incredibly comprehensive reaching farthest remote villages well. ingredient missing till vaccines (in sufficient quantity). Since available quantities smooth sailing. Must southern hospitality lol We've made mistake many times since beginning. province champion running cracked ankles, miracle still walk Mr. PPE instructor said like throwing roll paper towels, is. tiny symbolic amount nearly nothing you, he, think deserves lot praise it.
 
We know stop spread novel viruses know anything about. Lots lots PPE. treat aerosol, surface smear, droplet transfer, requires lots PPE. every single day pretty much every hospital world. Guess what? works fine. works pink eye measles, oh-dear-god-levels infectious.

But sure! Let's praise previous administration closing China pandemic detection team, cut ties warning systems, insisted re-creating US specific Covid detection kit work all, refused activate defense production acts make PPE, accept PPE countries including China. People renting private aircraft borrowing sports teams fly China pick donated supplies government let Chinese aircraft come drop off.
 
So sum up, administration president deserve much credit general totally boned it.

Have good day, I'll pass nonsense thanks. think lot people already lost lot brain cells getting vaccine.   Production isn‚Äôt something governments control, largest vaccine maker world (SII) struggling ramp production, aiming 120m doses/month next month going foreword. 

Given India‚Äôs economic status (low/medium income country) vaccine program praiseworthy. 

Even richest nations planet achieved 50% date absurd standard hold India too.  ""Long-term brain loss"" sounds like COVID removes brains entirely. Jeez wonder death count actually is‚Ä¶ millions occurs Florida might herd immunity goalposts since moved Delta variant. wish could take people like throw confined room 2 people. One virus, got vaccine, see much difference vaccine makes nearly dead compared person symptoms common cold most. general precise gap critical long long enough immune system sees two injections separate events (somewhere around 2-3 weeks, well past point 8 weeks).

In general, longer gaps tend produce stronger eventual immunity lower immunity waiting longer 2nd shot, there's tradeoff make. 50 million ( 5% population) shot! Delta variant effective second shot, 3rd wave gonna hit soon lockdown open , wear double mask. vigilant , patient reasonable

I like think way, it‚Äôs people less faith in. got 7 weeks. 
earlier saying 6-8 weeks covid. 
do research. times dont even asked covid. Brazil bad too, smaller population. States using MM/

You forgot also hate metric system. 

(‚ïØÔ∏µ‚ï∞,) professional opinion? Well I‚Äôm good cause hottest moms live right near want meet ""Just flu"", flu + boomer new study researchers United Kingdom found coronavirus may cause long-term brain loss could reason COVID-19 patients lose sense smell taste. ¬†

""In short, study suggests could long-term loss brain tissue COVID, would long-term consequences,"" former FDA Director Scott Gottlieb, MD,¬†said¬†on CNBC's¬†The News Shepard Smith.

""You could compensate time, symptoms may go away, never going regain tissue if, fact, destroyed result virus,"" said Gottlieb, also CNBC contributor.

According to¬†the study, researchers United Kingdom access brain image testing 40,000 people done start coronavirus pandemic.¬†

In 2021, asked hundreds people come back brain scans. Almost 800 responded. patients, 404 tested positive COVID-19, 394 usable brain scans taken pandemic.

Comparison before-and-after brain scans found ""significant effects COVID-19 brain loss grey matter""¬†in parts brain connected smell taste.

""All significant results found primary secondary cortical gustatory olfactory areas, left hemisphere, using grey matter information (volume, thickness),"" study found.

Loss smell taste one of¬†the hallmarks¬†of COVID-19 infection. Research shows continue 5 months virus first strikes.

""The diminishment amount cortical tissue happened regions brain close places responsible smell,"" Gottlieb said. ""What suggests smell, loss smell, effect primary process that's underway, process actually shrinking cortical tissue."" uncle Alex Jones? India population approximately 1.40 billion people. 

Assuming India targets 75% population vaccinated, that's population 1.05 billion. 

At 8 million per day, India vaccinate 75% population 131 days.

131 days today October 31. completely that! Hope continues Understandable - unfortunate window-lickers get endangering CAN'T. selfishness complete lack disregard others disgusting. last time publix sub 1999 still remember good was. THANK YOU. I'm virologist even close, general understanding. We're unbelievably messy middle part finding way global immunity. us incomplete undergraduate level understanding, getting good information hard enough. Wait, there‚Äôs unemployment Australia? You‚Äôd think utopia read /r/coronavirus Eating opposite hand juggling best ways ! trying wipe ones ass opposite hand impossible task .   Evolution action! calculating fraction hospitalizations vs. fraction people vaccine, controls age group, sex, etc.

Well that's proper way it. Without proper control group, many confounding factors age, sex. stuff like people getting vaccines probably likely careful overall, jsut one example. 

But bigger problem study everyone keeps posting, again...but tiny sample giant 95% confidence intervals. 

 
Look info study Pfizer 1 dose, example. range 47% (wouldn't even approved FDA) 99% (the most-effective vaccine history world!) Love - Go India!

For vast majority people, answer yes. hasn‚Äôt stopped hordes stampeding local doc-in-a-box antibody testing. get reliable answer testing, vaccinated people get specific kind test, right time. 
Take test soon, rely one looks wrong antibodies ‚Äî easy do, given befuddling array tests available ‚Äî may believe still vulnerable not. 
Actually, scientists would prefer average vaccinated person get antibody testing all, grounds it‚Äôs unnecessary. clinical trials, vaccines authorized United States provoked strong antibody response virtually participants. 
‚ÄúMost people shouldn‚Äôt even worrying this,‚Äù said Akiko Iwasaki, immunologist Yale University. 
But antibody tests crucial people weak immune systems take certain medications ‚Äî broad category encompassing millions people recipients organ donations, certain blood cancers, take steroids drugs suppress immune system. Mounting evidence suggests significant proportion people produce sufficient antibody response vaccination. 
If must get tested, want to, it‚Äôs essential get right kind test, Dr. Iwasaki said: ‚ÄúI feel little bit hesitant recommend everybody getting tested, unless really understood test doing, people might get wrong sense developed antibodies.‚Äù

Early pandemic, many commercial tests designed look antibodies coronavirus protein called nucleocapsid, N, infection, antibodies plentiful blood. 
But antibodies powerful required prevent virus infection, last long. important, antibodies N protein produced vaccines authorized United States; instead, vaccines provoke antibodies another protein sitting surface virus, called spike.

If people never infected vaccinated tested antibodies N protein instead spike, may rude shock.

David Lat, 46-year-old legal writer Manhattan, hospitalized Covid-19 three weeks March 2020, chronicled illness recovery Twitter. 
Over following year, Mr. Lat tested antibodies numerous times ‚Äî went pulmonologist cardiologist follow-ups, example, donate plasma. antibody levels high June 2020 steadily fell following months.

The decline ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt worry me,‚Äù Mr. Lat recalled recently. ‚ÄúI told expect would naturally wane, happy still positive.‚Äù 
Mr. Lat fully vaccinated March 22 year. antibody test April 21, ordered cardiologist, barely positive. Mr. Lat stunned: ‚ÄúI would thought month immunized, would antibodies roof.‚Äù 
Mr. Lat turned Twitter explanation. Florian Krammer, immunologist Icahn School Medicine Mount Sinai New York, responded, asking Mr. Lat test used. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs looked fine print test,‚Äù Mr. Lat said. realized test antibodies N protein, spike. 
‚ÄúIt seems default, give nucleocapsid one,‚Äù Mr. Lat said. ‚ÄúI never thought ask different one.‚Äù 
In May, Food Drug Administration recommended use antibody tests assessing immunity ‚Äî decision drawn criticism scientists ‚Äî provided bare-bones information testing health care providers. Many doctors still unaware differences antibody tests, fact tests measure one form immunity virus. 
Rapid tests commonly available deliver yes-no result may miss low levels antibodies. certain type lab test, called Elisa test, may offer semi-quantitative estimate antibodies spike protein. 
It‚Äôs also important wait tested least two weeks second shot Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna vaccines, antibody levels risen enough detectable. people receiving Johnson Johnson vaccine, period may long four weeks. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs timing antigen sensitivity assay ‚Äî going important,‚Äù Dr. Iwasaki said. 
In November, World Health Organization set standards antibody testing, allowing comparison different tests. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs lot good tests now,‚Äù Dr. Krammer said. ‚ÄúLittle little, manufacturers, places run adapting international units.‚Äù 
Antibodies one aspect immunity, noted Dr. Dorry Segev, transplant surgeon researcher Johns Hopkins University: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs lot happening surface antibody tests directly measuring.‚Äù body also maintains so-called cellular immunity, complex network defenders also responds invaders. 
Still, someone vaccinated immunocompromised, may helpful know protection virus isn‚Äôt be, said. example, transplant patient poor antibody levels might able use test results convince employer continue work remotely. 
Mr. Lat sought another test. learning vaccine likely given fresh increase antibodies, despite test results, reassurance enough: ‚ÄúI trust vaccines work.‚Äù great analogy. Run early gonna mess long time. live New Mexico. crappy economy (pre-covid), high poverty rate low medical resources, we've vaccinated almost 60% eligible population. solid Governor, someone chooses make medical issue politically divisive issue.

As far effectiveness goes, Wikipedia entry COVID-19 vaccines suggests pretty good, nothing extraordinary. bet lot vaccines could done single shots, would bit gamble money, time lives line. think much expected rise cases fall due seasonal factors Nah I‚Äôve reading research reports debunking misinformation since whole shit started always misinformation based one-off occurrence. one eliminate endemic strain point don‚Äôt really see much actual proof ‚Äúvariant‚Äù could evolve much transmissibility base variant.

Before pandemic, Celso Vigo walked 90 minutes day streets Serrana, town 45,000 people surrounded sugarcane Ô¨Å¬Åelds state S√£o Paulo. covid¬≠19 hit, 75-¬≠year-¬≠old retired bank clerk, played football ‚Äúwell 60s‚Äù, reduced loops around house. reminded Brazil, too, going circles. second wave killed 87,000 people April, cases deaths remain high. 
 
But Serrana given way out. February April, adults oÔ¨Ä¬êered jabs part study Butantan Institute, produces CoronaVac, vaccine developed Sino¬≠vac, Chinese Ô¨Å¬Årm. 95% serranenses got jabbed, despite Jair Bolso¬≠ naro, president, claiming unsafe. Preliminary results released May 31st showed symptomatic cases deaths fell 80% 95%, re¬≠spectively. two covid¬≠19 patients remain hospitalised local clinic (both refused vaccine). Mr Vigo pounding pavements. 
 
Serrana tantalising glimpse alternative reality Brazil‚Äîone Mr Bolsonaro squander chances mount eÔ¨Ä¬êective public¬≠ health campaign and, later, buy vac¬≠cines. study also global im¬≠plications. phase three trials, Corona¬≠Vac eÔ¨É¬ècacy rates low 50%, minimum required who. lower eÔ¨É¬ècacy, higher share people must jabbed slow con¬≠tagion. trial Serrana sought discover share. town split four cohorts, got jabbed successive weeks. Contagion dropped dramatically three four received two doses vaccine, suggesting herd immunity at¬≠tained around 75%. 
 
These results could boost vaccine uptake across Brazil, hopes Ethel Maciel, epidemiologist. 75% long way oÔ¨Ä¬ê. 11% Brazilians fully vacci¬≠nated, rate slowed shortage ingredients CoronaVac, imported China. Chile, vaccinated 45% pop¬≠ulation, mostly CoronaVac, also suÔ¨Ä¬êering near ¬≠record cases. 
 
But Serrana become oasis. recent morning, children ran round fountain plaza. Across street fabric shop caters elderly women steady stream custom¬≠ers. gang old men occupied usual benches. discussed Mr Bolso¬≠ naro‚Äôs decision host Copa Am√©rica, football tournament, even though third wave seems imminent. ‚ÄúStupid,‚Äù 97¬≠year¬≠old said. Half scattered outsider showed up. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still scared,‚Äù explained Florivaldo Leandro, retired police oÔ¨É¬ècer. Serrana‚Äôs calm came cost, said. ‚ÄúWe lost friends, neighbours relatives. conscientiousness forced upon us.‚Äù Flus coming back hard lately due lower natural immunity dead flu season. tested negative Covid, extremely likely another illness. Odd, US older people generally wanted things opened back up. got first dose today..it free. reason people filling plastic bags gas! makes sense now! downside Sputnik approach complicates logistics - rather one product, two need produced rate.  run production trouble one (as evidently dose 2) end awkward surplus keep throttling good production line &amp; match bad one (and cause problems itself, bet..) Play mentally deficient games, win regrettable prizes. already impossible back then. We‚Äôd chance maybe never left China. reached Italy, Iran etc. practically game over. Plenty issues Australian origin. Rupert Murdoch made media empire built selling lies confusion masses. blame Russia! Terrible serious outcomes? seem affect younger people more, although conclusive data back statement. Truly. public enquiry it. ""Not point fingers make recommendations"".
