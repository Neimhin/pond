0,2021-05-17," sure getting voted. would classify gamer nerd love seeing nerds lose shit too. masks required Publix! Target near me, Ohio, enforced gusto. first dose made feel really bad. second gave rash arm. Restrictions technically firm partial lockdowns. Like closing movie theatres, nightclubs etc. commenting horrible situation teachers face US. Use brain. Lmao flu symptoms: chills, bones hurting, fever, sweating. That's far... got results today.  I'm Canadian bothers since borders economies intertwined. family members living opposite sides border. We're joined hip. Two months ago Canada 8% US 25% first doses. trends kept up, US 70+% first doses now. Canada 45.7%. pace overtake end week. I'm afraid vaccine resistant variant could emerge back square one. Yea right.. Maryland, security guards would post front door specifically stop anyone mask. Months later started supplying people masks entering store. vaccine works every variant they've tested it.

Scientists tend cautious making definite statements, they'll say might variant future work. Sure, can't prove be. there's specific reason expect it. 0 evidence proposing. Continued misinformation result ban. u/positivityrate done amazing work compiling data/info vaccines effectiveness, including variants:  Appropriate rules useful even aren‚Äôt enforceable. aren‚Äôt good appropriate, enforceable rules, better poorly formed rules, rules. Thank you.

So tired pointing out.  Thank this. aware truth that's right front along. significant amount 11-15 age group vaccinated time. cleaning nothing. Surface contamination minimal cases people got sick way. Social distancing obviously works, masks, compromise, wearing masks seem like much cost. meeting Kings Island going maskless year, what? gotta free Beast. actual symptoms? Even cold like symptoms count symptomatic obviously mild. [University Hawaii's vaccine requirement [reported Don‚Äôt ridiculous. Dental pain worse problems coronavirus causes feel like it‚Äôs ripping parts society shreds. :/ indeed picking fight. It‚Äôs internet works‚Ä¶ latter clearly someone discussing context fact wearing mask.

We know Republicans lower vaccination rates knee-jerk opposition masks lead many lie unmask. see airport enforcement continuing? also makes lot things convenient. went without social media better part last year missed lot. Like family kept loop important events, missed much little stuff. real threat though? People always talk I‚Äôve never seen evidence it‚Äôs thing could actually happen. Let's face it, climate change much future anyways. someone Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis young, attention needs given this.  Target employee currently shift, today weird day. Lots people walking around smug smiles. Other, kinder people asked us we're sure okay. I'd still prefer masks little longer. entire thread US, don‚Äôt know feel need comment then. Yeah looked up. idea they'd turned stripmalls. TIL Forever keeper. Trust tells now. Get vaccinated wanna die then. problem fucks get kids sick. Oh well, booked flight Miami tomorrow. I‚Äôll back 6/15 folks!

But seriously, right move. 6/15, cases deaths nationwide low lifting mask mandates altogether relatively uncontroversial decision, except among cranks r/coronavirus. it‚Äôs month away, ffs! 

(P.S. case Covid police decides come me, received 2nd dose two weeks ago, got lucky leftovers) Instead downvoting you, ask, what‚Äôs case rise without rise hospitalizations deaths? 

Yes, variants, shouldn‚Äôt tempt fate get variant can‚Äôt control vaccine, ran road tempting fate around time suggested drink bleach shove light ass. Apparently they're unlucky odds, simply lying getting vaccine. Neat info, thanks. gonna say one Mainstreets CO important advice unvaccinated need continue wear masks. propose followed everyone ditches masks?

I'd love answer too. someone high risk kid living plague rat den, wtf? never understand people babies masks.

Also, backfire, everyone going willing lock again? keep seeing covid subs majority opinion seems be: vaccinated = pandemic over. guess no. stubborn deniers we've already had, we'll stubborn vaccinated deniers too.

I'm convinced lot people cheering saying it'll, somehow, convince enough people get vaccinated underestimating sheer amount stubborn willful ignorance we're dealing with. seems like CDC acknowledging can‚Äôt end COVID US, since we‚Äôre even projected reach herd immunity point. they‚Äôre issuing guidance intended keep people hospitalized dying. People risk COVID fully vaccinated months now, middle aged people young adults one shot gives partial immunity greatly reduces chances bad COVID infection, children always low chance bad case abysmally low chance death COVID.

They‚Äôre basically saying know COVID continue spread US, people longer dying going hospital nearly rates saw vaccines. that‚Äôs OK. Life isn‚Äôt risk free, it‚Äôs unreasonable CDC governments completely eliminate risk COVID life goes back normal. intentional start. was/is difference telling kids need give people distance less chance people would spread germs vs. teaching child fear people. Also, kids like pandemic, hard know behavior comes from.

At point we're soldiering masking/ general social distancing nursery school starts fall. We've endured much past year; get dumb disease would insult top injury. another example American globalism.  Even two weeks first dose gives fairly good immunity. Maybe enough go clubbing, enough go grocery store without worry. rate international arrivals continue constrained state territory quarantine caps 2021 first half It‚Äôs good. start making 18+ appointments tomorrow. hell u live mcdonalds pays 16?!?! I‚Äôm one students leaving school school bus, believe it‚Äôs gets closed due Gwyneth Paltrow dying. chemo patients, immuno compromised

In vast majority cases, immunocompromised cancer patients receive vaccine. don‚Äôt think people saying they‚Äôre spewing crap, think people saying don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs time want time people get vaccinated. ‚Ä¶But sacrifice willing make. beauty free market. get decide shop üòä think CDC saying masks longer required vaccinated people best decision could made. I've talked acquaintances fence getting vaccinated before, want go get vaccine. they're going get it. They're reasoning? Everyone using masks feel need get shot, everyone wear masks anymore, feel need protected now. trust unvaccinated wear masks want protected them. appreciate perspective. Maybe aware long delayed get vaccine others are. don‚Äôt ask proof vaccination either none employees wearing masks except ones small children home at. Half store isn‚Äôt actually vaccinated. Wash - like hundreds thousands cases per day past winter? dumb. simply enforce. 

At point one wear mask, it. 

If businesses think Americans honestly self enforce mask vaccinated, dumb 50% US. i‚Äôm gen z got second dose week ago anti-maskers already wearing masks. 
 
Not state weren't. allowed stores without mask kicked immediately. change means they'll soon able enter without mask. Why? 

‚ÄòTo protect others‚Äô. vaccine matter don‚Äôt? 

‚ÄòBecause vaccine doesn‚Äôt stop spreading it‚Äô. would take it? 

‚ÄòIt lessens side effects‚Äô. asymptomatic isn‚Äôt made up, I‚Äôve coronavirus many times there‚Äôs side effects. 

Please, give reason get vaccine, I‚Äôll counteract it. can‚Äôt think something I‚Äôll consider getting Yes... non vaccinated people totally comply... Hmm, get it. Kids can't get vaccinated part. lady soon find probably can't taking kids everywhere little while, accept risks. would probably worry, too, reckon I'll pop mask find getting near kids, parents peace mind. also matches schools out. Good! People need start made take it, stay homes refuse. literally get downvoted oblivion whenever say sub Outdoor vs indoor.  Can't wait sub never front 0age Excuse you? want lie pharmacy eligibility mean 'stalled'. got earliest appointment could get. care whether want wear mask point. care whether mandate ends tomorrow next month. means even masks required, unvaccinated people infect other. 

I‚Äôm answering question places cases didn‚Äôt go mask mandates removed.

I‚Äôm tired changing goalposts I‚Äôve patiently explained reasoning even given source two.

I‚Äôm predicting apocalypse I‚Äôm expecting cases increase result changes due unvaccinated people infecting other. shit lived country like US thousands dying every day, would take mask death. luckily live Vietnam don‚Äôt worry anymore. pediatrician considered expert COVID children? would be? expect apologies everyone stupid conspiracy theories emergency measures form vast conspiracy must resisted never lifted. 

Oh nevermind. know they‚Äôll never confess idiots, they‚Äôll move without even acknowledging stupidity. Great information. Thanks clarification.

Also, heard shedding theory weeks ago. thinking days ago realizing priorities could actually shed. mRNA programming cells produce mRNA lives currently realm fantasy.

I think lot people holdouts waiting final authorization / see might interact common vaccines life events.

Not saying I'm agreeing that, that's them, think there's least measurable amount people think way. CDC's science, read website, actually suggests continued use masks social distancing. epidemiologists believe masking would necessary next year. declaration runs counter that. You‚Äôre making pretty broad, sweeping statement there. actuality, depends live. PNW, mask mandates heavily enforced businesses. goes Walmart Target. seen several times stores. worried about. don‚Äôt want carry niece nephew working Target doesn‚Äôt require proof vaccination nobody mask, ones mask today children home interact someway kids. know least half store work isn‚Äôt vaccinated say it‚Äôs ‚Äúinjecting poison...‚Äù including much management at.

My understanding ask proof without HIPAA already people show vaccination cards couple hours pay anyways. don‚Äôt know wouldn‚Äôt able enforced more. Im watching ""the good place""... Wow rib Arizona nothing compares roast Florida every turn millions children included definition ""someone""? statement vaccinations. groups fine now. Im vaccinated. social distanced. wore mask.

At point ends. everyone wear masks get vaccinated. point say F em. personal Corona fight done won.

If get sick, you. get sick, that's bad. really. Vietnam dealt several waves 37 deaths. one kinda tricky things fairly stable now.

That stuff scares me: need boosters, risk folks got early vaccines need soon; know effective vaccination current variants Bar anything worth outside home. Biden did? Wasn‚Äôt much infrastructure place well office? Oh yeah, ideally everyone would made plans soon eligible. checked updates damn near every day months vaccine front. Unfortunately everyone tuned looking it. public access vaccine say month ago, think matter time crosses social circles necessarily uninformed availability. 

I'm willing give little leeway next month people get squared away. everyone drop everything get done priority, fair give time. mid-June, however, get done. month long enough find time works them. People claim move ‚Äúfollowing science‚Äù need sit down. Masks almost effective preventing disease vaccines require little investment / inconvenience.

No absolutely not. science shows almost certain contract COVID sit room someone COVID, even wearing masks. vaccine far effective masks. ""I'm afraid I'll mistaken Covid denier/Republican"" support claim?? 

Trolls wasting time. fact think 90% us agree haha. wear store it‚Äôs rule CDC stupid

Trust science  real world data unlikely get covid even vaccinated pass someone else. 
Vaccines works better masks stopping spread.  pace beautiful numbers coming beautiful. I'm certainly going relish passing US, idiots keep thinking rollout disaster rather bashing US (who great role making vaccines). particular concern vaccine? I‚Äôll answer question.

I say one. asked science responsible recent change CDC policy since logical reason given. 

My problem never science, problem usually politicians policy.  hope so. AZ guy question period yesterday made seem like worst decision possible. doesn‚Äôt article include lowest states die, die. 

I know that's meme, certain point, can't inhibit normal people crazy people comply. Remember exponential growth? Exponential decay works way! Sure, know many that. built plans. Thanks mom. honestly? It‚Äôs not. currently there‚Äôs 1 10 chance maskless person come could spread me, minimum. goes person room I‚Äôm with. hanging Outside distanced friends still much safer indoor dinners. pronounced Target Target? Okay, conditions timeframe? left house times month indoors maybe hours would great. go work every day, full +8 hour shift, bunch people want take Covid seriously.

The low risk suddenly might higher, roll odds every day likely one times get unlucky. Incredible incompetence phase pandemic. scored pretty well first round, punishing thousands due heavy handed travel restrictions. Gonna need source claiming vaccines significantly less effective established trials. Fair enough. hope ever safer vaccine comes study condition-specifix outcomes. Sorry put with. roommate eyes plant-based vaccine tested Canada. telling end working, let alone safer, there's chance.

I hope enough people get it, get it, hopefully get back level security normality. know position sucks see everyone getting *even more* lax. local Walmart still facemask mandates, local Target not. think meant vaccinations general, Covid vaccines specifically, example. Like, ""aren't children required get polio measles vaccines attending school?""

I think person trying use make point response saying compulsory vaccination would cause protests

Firstly, COVID-19 markedly increases risk CVT, adding list blood clotting problems infection causes. Secondly, COVID-19 risk higher see current vaccines, even 30; something taken account considering balances risks benefits Fucking. Morons. Thanks links People made political. Judgmental people found low hanging fruit make fun chosen side. People dug in, seeing fact people hanging masks virulently refused them. Best Buy also said thing, depending state laws fact, I've asked similar question heard ""September earliest"" answer. know vaccinated person can‚Äôt pass COVID along unvaccinated person? 142 days China vaccinated rate.

honestly attitude concerns me. People switch theyre day day get sick. proper hygiene distancing could help us lower eradicate flu. id argue great example small little changes you‚Äôre sick help community large. next time start getting sniffles, mask store, opt order instead sneezing around restaurant. means, live life, remember cold doesn‚Äôt seem bad you, guy front deli may newborn home beloved grandma could help prevent dying. feel anti mask push may pushed finish line away fair, ""compliance"" longer means wearing mask Target. people wearing masks breaking rules. Welp, that's dumb. Also, kids good wearing masks, hygiene. will... helps prevent asthma allergies. 36 year old here, near phobia needles. voluntarily gotten flu shot. told nurse covid shots I'mjust gonna stare space see needle instinctively pull away. Neither shot actually big deal, ant bite literally hurts more. Functional, normal societies parts world using masks long time. Hell, We‚Äôre we‚Äôre going Southern US couple years back Doctor recommended getting Hep B shot, did. get flu shot every year. Virus (or next) take care antiVaxxers. agree simply happening conservatives choosing make personal freedoms issue. Employeers require anything want bunch pricks. least healthcare, provide proof whole bunch vaccines. would surprised covid added list. Nope, living real world, one everything distorted anti-America propaganda. plenty criticize America for, case, EU moral high ground. likes counting. &lt;.01% chance. Seems like promising odds me.  Whatever takes reasonable person believes science, ask specifically concerned about, honestly answer questions one one. means acknowledging risks math prove benefits outweigh risks. tell there's absolutely nothing worry (i.e. 0% risk), disingenuous she'll feel like pushing agenda rather meaningful, scientific discussion.  Ok info CDC (scroll way bottom): here's article Harvard (scroll end): WebMD article debunks infertility rumour/misinformation: Except vaccinated people pass onto kids young vaccine.

Then kids continue wear mask. He‚Äôs moms go source information entire time. always says ‚Äúmy good friend, Scott‚Äù she‚Äôs sharing insight listens much. thought emancipation? Surely legal grounds child endangerment neglect. work six young people. got vaxxed soon eligible. hope convince peers parents same.

There's point benefits outweigh risks, point unvaccinated risks unvaccinated care. AZ JnJ surprising positive, sick enough go ER surprising. plain sociopathy part executives.

Like said before, science, know people educated, trained spend day job telling us young children, even asymptomatic transferring virus children.

Schools need open science telling us safe. follow educated, trained people say. follow live fear.

Honesty people, schools open, teachers, work hard keep environment clean safe possible. 20 years profession, see children missing. get it, I'm teacher education, skills knowledge children's learning important completely disregarded. stay home mom thinks know Youtube bubbles says so.

Follow science. good lasted, fellow Americans Yep, 5 year old would definitely spill beans sick kids

Yeah fuck parents work, right?

Depriving kids social interaction stimulation probably developmental damage covid would  year plus pandemic I‚Äôll glad it‚Äôs over. constant fear coming press virus specifically gets old it‚Äôs negative part. It‚Äôs challenge wear mask, don‚Äôt interactions people obviously wearing it.

I feel like robot human wearing say almost lose part individuality makes unique are. don‚Äôt get see people smile anything - see mask everyone afraid people. It‚Äôs sad... buy Fosun damn it. saving people's lives vs. saving face.  going cause serious confusion.

You're safe vaccinated...unless diabetes, heart disease, obesity, arthritis, etc.

So that's pretty much 75%+ seniors?

Talk really confusing message speculative data. canada like america without stupid People don‚Äôt get vaccinated still stealing rest looking ways penalize accordingly. Risk exponentially lower people around vaccinated.

Most drunk drivers make home without incident, even crash rarely hurt others‚Ä¶ statistically speaking. Much likely drive road tree/barrier another vehicle. still fine crap anyone drives drunk. good reason. Yeah, basically Cali. spread makes difficult though. Why? threat vaccinated person. vaccine stop contraction transmitting virus. 
It astounding many people.seem think vaccine work one else vaccinated. That's vaccine work wholesome. Why? fully vaccinated back early February I‚Äôm vaccinations, longer risk. care vaccinated well? Yea, there's way Canada pass week. We've booked dates first shot vaccinations solid next 3-4 weeks least, vaccine expected arrive already arriving. US even waiting lists anymore. really wish myth of, ""China kept wraps"" would die.

A group local politicians Wuhan thought would hurt political fortunes (they worried fired, non-Xi CCP faction) came novel disease spreading. also major event going Wuhan too.

It covered days people, truth came out, central government try keep control (and fired people hid it).

Then people trying pretend China lied severity, even though case. novel disease - know everything immediately. Hell we're **still** learning things it. Pennsylvanian, I'm pretty sure would work well lmao. Low-key kind hope do.   feel bad much better Hope right. Let's right things get thing good. get political, plenty people (500K+) missing someone cared about. know many pile old they, conditions etc matter. Many lives cut shorter thinks nasty bug. sad..it human nature. People motivated different things almost areas life.

I applaud ohio. Doubt states let go covid stimulus funds similar actions. states needs new vans office needs remodeling Thank you. I‚Äôm supposed trust maskless fucks vaccinated ""works"" ""have effectiveness"" thing, really hope realize that. 

The new variants shown least somewhat resistant vaccine antibodies, may mean small change infection rates, could easily another full wave (including vaccinated people)

I'm increasingly coming believe right. fucking sucks. CDC said *vaccinated people* don‚Äôt need masks. recommend unvaccinated people continue mask socially distance. 

The problem us vaccinated people ditch masks, becomes impossible police who‚Äôs vaccinated Target Walmart, it‚Äôs going turn personal responsibility free pretty much overnight. Oof real burn won‚Äôt travel place requires test arrival even though I‚Äôm vaccinated. test positive land? we‚Äôve seen Yankees, it‚Äôs possible fully vaxxed test positive asymptomatic. spent countless hours plane, hundreds thousands dollars, stuck hotel 14 days? thank you.

Places need let testing requirements fully vaxxed people want tourists return. NZ done well. Sure, I'm saying massive testing wrong. costly fool-proof community spread. TW going today different NZ August, October, early year, etc. etc. That's I'm saying.

No, different small outbreaks NZ. peak daily case load August cluster 13 quickly fell 2 4 cases day. outbreak community cluster NZ February one never 4 cases single day limited 3 families end. 

Taiwan cases single day entire August February outbreaks combined NZ. means spreading silently within Taiwan lengthy period time, probably several weeks. Regular surveillance testing NZ would caught earlier. really struggle shut now. Melbourne took months severe lockdown get hundreds cases day zero. Yup, vaccinated, effectively done work hour took get shot year reducing spread. Wyoming could sure use this. 25 ish % state vaccinated barely anyone shows clinics now.

I‚Äôve plenty shots, one didn‚Äôt hurt One day I'll live Canada. One day... awesome. adopt elsewhere too, especially states low vaccination rates. add released numbers hitting 200 million first doses end april population 330 million. Would trust site accurate data. key answer question right here: said Taiwan ‚Äústupid‚Äù focusing testing people presented symptoms also travel history connection confirmed case, rather one other. Monday, rapid testing established Wanhua, meaning potentially many cases undetected.

It's also shocking refused call snap lockdown. Snap lockdowns rapid mass testing proven extremely effective stopping outbreaks Australia New Zealand many times now. Taiwan going quickly lose gold standard reputation act quickly. I'm pretty sure CDC factor stuff like dishonesty projected trends making announcement.  Oh god, three words, get yourself. Next say Gossip Girl trademark ""I love you"" üòÜ okay loose vaccination requirements.. ‚Äònot checked‚Äô open.

Not sure that‚Äôs happening , it‚Äôs great many people feeling better. 

I‚Äôve heard theories vaccine ‚Äúresetting‚Äù overactive immune system cases long covid. Exactly line thinking too, could lead pretty dark places. gotta buddy blames older generations happened ‚Äò08, he‚Äôs fuming school wouldn‚Äôt let back onto campus. resentment really grown this, becoming borderline agism. wouldn‚Äôt surprised fringe people mentality, too. That's plan. EU countries. seems like natural immunity works well: want vaccine? free choose natural immunity, enjoy ride! 

That way it'll possible get back ""normal"" quickly, long hospital saturation problem immunity slowly progress among whole population, even though death could avoided. correct. likely people asymptomatic infections peak viral loads never reached levels enough transmission.

On hand sterilizing immunity supposed viral replication antibody bump. opened 35's (by July 1st 2021) morning fact. good pushed get number agree number insanely high.

Does trypanophobia something? Honestly countries think better half 40 year olds half 20 year olds vaccinated instead 40 year olds single 20 year old. Many people contacts similarly aged people. highest risk group done prevent deaths, widespread distribution effective keeping cases down. Sounds like placebo effect  area, downward trends COVId numbers right nearly identical time last year. concern numbers tracking back another wave September too. That‚Äôs cruel children. Might well let ever ride car they‚Äôre likely die wreck actually COVID. Same, almost entire social circle already vaccinated. Maybe 80+ years old, unvaccinated, multiple comorbidities, also risk factors like obesity.  already know come wet market. first superspreader event.

There's straw man argument. Simply following logic. Correct wrong seem concerned people getting vaccine placing burden health insurance tax payers

Yeah, US far far ahead fully vaccinated people Canadian trolls going cRiES cAnaDiAn recently every thread vaccines. new cases people yet fully vaccinated around 80% people requiring hospital treatment COVID-19 vaccinated co-morbidities

That's ""fully vaccinated"" who've first dose; seems effective hospitalizations, although like idea including co-morbidities criterion we're talking vaccine effectiveness; co-morbidities come age, age major driver severe symptoms hospitalization.

That said, agree vaccine effective year ago we'd praised outcome. 

It's also worth noting site linked says single dose Pfizer *ineffective* B1.1.7 - contradicts general position, might indicative low quality information source.

Yeah, people way pessimistic this. dashboard Germany's vaccination efforts reassuring: Everyone know says, shot hurt. dunno. feel like people actually well aware chance close zero, not. Might get lucky.   Yeah that‚Äôs France except legally speaking German resident. work went fully remote decided move family support home lockdowns instead alone tiny flat Germany.

For 9/11, sure. get sick remove equation. Sooooo, get vaccine stop trying police peoples stupidity. well may case, but, I'd curious see data would skewed, certain percentage people already ill Covid likely would take much seriously would mask up, social distance ever, previously may thought disease liberal hoax nothing cold flu. Ohio actually couple months back, J&amp;J became widely available - sent colleges allow students chance get quickly vaccinated one-and-done without search it.

Ohio‚Äôs hardly perfect, (most of) COVID response vaccine rollout made feel lucky live global pandemic. hope nobody wins mean hope too. assumed would bit better USA much. Especially since neighbor France vaccine averse. friend Covid.

Vaccination rates plateauing everywhere chipping away unvaccinated numbers. carrots point. reason private businesses can‚Äôt fire discrimination. Section 5 14th amendment civil rights act prohibit businesses public accommodation discriminating based race religion color creed. places like Target Costco, imagine vaccinated parents unvaccinated children still wear masks support kids.

And people following day-to-day CDC health department announcements kind stuff. year masks, kind routine now.  source that? hear thus far. Pretty surprising considering initial plan lag 3 weeks behind state. wonder changed make willing jump ahead? universities right, rest many schools close late June 25th mean strip savings right quick don‚Äôt moderate spending.

Aaaaaand I'm stuck Japan, 3% vaccinated Full text: European Union's drugs regulator said Pfizer Covid vaccine stored fridge temperature much longer previously recommended.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said vaccines thawed, unopened vials could kept fridge month.

The current limit five days.

The increased flexibility expected significant impact vaccine roll-out across EU.

The need transport storage low temperatures one major disadvantages Pfizer jab.

The previous storage requirements Pfizer vaccines made harder use parts world.

In February, United States approved storage transport Pfizer vaccine standard freezer temperatures -15 -25C two weeks, opposed -80 -60C usually requires.

Earlier month Canada authorised use Pfizer vaccine children ages 12 15, becoming first country age group. name better news broadcast. Goeorgia opened month half spikes COVID. vaccine hesitant back internet even thing. severe reactions pharmaceuticals myself, then, one year went work large hospital mom &amp; brother worked, well. employee intake, titer tests ensure MMR immunity. 

Turned 3 us, mom, brother &amp; I, antibodies. re-vaccinated. Again, antibodies didn‚Äôt develop. 
So, came time vaccinate children, decided wait started 1st grade. figured could something genetic, rush inject school. 

I probably voted this. It‚Äôs experience. worry. understand vaccines modern medicine miracle. hesitation nothing crazy youtube videos, essential oils, anything like that. It‚Äôs 100% past experiences side effects worry me. 

That said, 70% convinced getting covid shot. shows lot people country don‚Äôt care others. Hell, people hoarded gas thought pipeline would never come back online. all, Americans really selfish assholes. Currently studying kids 12-15. Nothing 12 yet testing, nothing 15 open vaccines.

This true U.S. Kids 12+ get Pfizer. They're currently running clinical trials believe 2-11 years age, Moderna right behind them. Pfizer expects seek approval 2-11 ages September, hope move forward July cover kids starting school August.

Pretty sure both, least everyone know group. adults overblowing Covid know going people - determine life others. AndI trying stay topic guy saying masks. problem masks employees cannot get vaccinated yet. continue wear mine. well, thanks. pick choose science guy. honest used CDC English. go Robert Koch Institute German. 

But even CDC numbers shows cases 10% children USA. Germany schools open year little spread schools. screw numeric facts engineer, observation hold water.

I interpreted data myself. straight numbers there. numbers children spreading virus low. straight facts. believe facts clear. mind made want believe feel right. 

Sorry, see people choose data believe factual bases, provided none. better anti-vaxer me. leave science scientist. fuck don‚Äôt. Fuck lying illegal
In media science change. Biden administration historically bad week needed put one W column trotted CDC relax recommendations probably could relaxed around time TX, FL states ended mask mandates. Yeah I'm sick bullshit fear mongering. That's never wear seatbelt, never buy smoke-detector propaganda. shits pussies. thing life jackets boat. nothing nickel diming death, selling things fearful. thing fear fear itself, nobody actually dies fires, drowning, car accidents, etc. it‚Äôll sure catch slackasses. Dropping mask mandate seems gotten attention, money probably work even better. know it‚Äôs surprising point people slacking it, truly are. honestly think people denied access healthcare system. share burden idiocy. time brought back survival fittest, world overpopulated anyways. You‚Äôll see lot uptake colleges done.

This key. Finals happening major school events. Nobody wants risk sick vaccine side effects^* day finals day. 

^* personally believe much information scaring people possible side effects. know lot vaccinated people, one two side effects would big enough deal want stay home next day. Yes, includes second shot, way overhyped difficult. focus cases people serious side effects. got first moderna shot yesterday arm bit sore. side effects. totally fine  Ohioan, hope works, really really do. I'm kindof dubious claim article single day spike indicative scheme already ""working.""

Honestly, feel made stimulus payments contingent vaccination. Furthermore, make vaccination requirement collecting unemployment benefits.  There‚Äôs nowhere *near* 10% chance. Fewer 0.02% vaccinated people gotten infected, yet found single instance vaccinated person passing another vaccinated person. 

90% reduction likelihood (and 95 trials) would 10% 100% likelihood catching every uncovered nose saw. Given didn‚Äôt catch six times day last 14 months, never 100%. Thats awesome there's reason every single person wear one live Washington. I've proud we, state, handled lockdown vaccination effort. 52.2% state first shot, 37.3% second.

Barring resurgence due variants, pandemic us end June! word ""warns"" context gaslighting. read said statement.
Putting ""warns"" headline implies threat ""or else"". 
It‚Äôs cool, got clicks though /s money specifically earmarked pandemic response programs, finding ways help end pandemic. clearly qualifies.  really hoping announces week Florida significantly higher deaths states locked RIGHT spite us older population, open business NINE MONTHS! lockdowns even slow measurable amount states, Florida absolutely booming. 

But take word it. Use compare function site (I can't link directly) compare FL CA, NY, NJ, MI. deaths per capita them, Florida almost restrictions months months. People come NY NJ they're shock sit bar place 100% capacity, since last November can't see data. 

You STOP VIRUS RESTRICTION. slow down. edited wasn‚Äôt finished writing comment. Also nice profile stalking. sure sign you‚Äôre losing argument try dig unrelated dirt bring different topic. Unfortunately didn‚Äôt work :( Yea, Germany going pretty hard now.

And still scale up, get supplies. Yeah, chose social distance instead.


It's even effective, provides lower risk personal health. India, land many gods.... witness 2 extremely dramatic fights caused pro-maskers. One crazy lady wearing mask, gloves face shield cafe. absolutely lost shit pregnant mom &amp; unmasked toddler. made news bad. that, 12 year old daughter, witnessed fight, too, literally nightmares public without mask on. 

I think anti/pro mask thing partially influenced region/culture region. course crazy people sides coin everywhere‚Äîand seen crazy anti-mask fights internet, area, it‚Äôs seemingly mostly pro mask. 

For record, absolutely hate masks core being. But, still wear mine bec don‚Äôt want confrontations. read WHO-convened global study. Virus came frozen peas. Case closed. confirm similar experience UK.

I'm 29, sent enquiry GP getting vacci e early due previous lung issue. Immediately got send text book first dose. Took less 10 minutes health centre get jabbed local health centre. Got text last weekend 2nd dose, got booked coming Friday.

The half went walk appointment local mass vaccination centre. book 2nd dose national booking system. Vaccines approved FDA. Trials done. 

Show us Constitution says proof vaccination forbidden.  ‚ÄúYou waited hour dis? Clawn‚Äù this, although reason.

Under 30s getting AZ jab, Pfizer rolled 20 y/o AZ used 35+.

Six 22-27 y/o friends vaccine booked already is, CDC recommendation UNVACCINATED people continue wear masks. get finish line I'm going stand continue running wait everyone else catch up. equivalent asking. weaken side effects. You‚Äôve never ever heard tweaking formula vaccine? reduce number spike proteins vaccine. change required shots 2 3 make vaccine dose watered less side effects overall dose same. Moderna tested 2 dose version concentration they‚Äôve since day 1. Pfizer Johnson Johnson.  sure located quick check North Bay/Parry Sound health unit website shows openings almost vaccination centres next couple weeks.

Maybe try booking waiting four weeks. 1.	‚Å†It lung cancer screening. weren‚Äôt actually sick. said, chest scans done point fill questionnaires. Either guys comically incompetent somehow managed miss pandemic right nose (with scans even done!) every single one cases asymptomatic? There‚Äôs way.
2.	‚Å†Considering know COVID, makes sense around months death.
3.	‚Å†They used home made ‚Äúproprietary‚Äù antibody test. tricky best times, provide evidence validation test besides another article wrote also pending publication peer reviewed... chance false positive huge. MINIMUM done negative control serum 2018 sure. not.
4.	‚Å†The proportion IgG IgM wrong. would expect total amount positives would balanced IgG IgM IgG (it stays around longer). case. Something like 85% positives IgM. IgM tests finicky best times notorious giving false positives, especially low levels. Since didn‚Äôt note antibody titer, can‚Äôt check.
5.	‚Å†They positive control 111 antibodies check neutralisation (if antibody something real live Covid). 5% (!!!!!!) ‚Äúpositive‚Äù tests came back positive. joke.
6.	‚Å†The ‚Äújournal‚Äù published impact factor 0.87.... means article published two years ago will, average, cited less one time! It‚Äôs basically moms reading shit.

So, sum: bad science, bad tests, wild assumptions, bad controls, bad journal. shit around. That‚Äôs rich coming Atlantic places Thank you, nobody seems give crap kids. reality red carpet rolled instead expected stay home two years. It‚Äôs really unfair. need know jack statistics probability know fact something like chance tiny win lottery. 

Think good way get lot people sign vaccinations, probably lot cheaper long run too.  course, vaccinations require two shots‚Äîbut still impressive. study published researchers University Chile 6 April, 
 Cort√©s involved, found CoronaVac vaccine  
**56.5% effective preventing infections two weeks second dose**  
but 3% effective single dose. That‚Äôs false‚Ä¶it‚Äôs annoying clueless people speak absolutes Belgium alone 800.000 shots week.

Germany almost daily‚Äîwith obviously bigger population. ;) Well that's stupid response. microchip vaccine coming back ""hurr Durr phone thing"" telling stupid people chip vaccine.

Then, besides that, surely understand difference cell phone attached body physically implanted object.

That's stupid response. I'm sorry is. turning point: look funny vaccinated care no-mask no-vax idiots. Game over.

children 12 run get vaccinated today

5 11 vaccine end summer

until must wear mask, wash hands, safe distance like 1 year 2 months. 

but vaccinated means less chances meet spreader Israelis targetting civilian sites military sites? thought weapons USA sold precision missles minimize hitting civilians say anything punishment. Post Harvard doctor asking investigation origins find hopefully prevent happening again. Commentor claiming look this, act god. Etc. said may act god maybe check out. utter word punishment. drop?

Eta: lmao misread!!! read 328 saw 382. really reddit morning coffee. DEAL, McKutchen! Moon Money MINE! \~ Homer get vaccinated. Ty businesses places requiring masks kind defeats purpose guidance. Like hey say principal nearly every place go still requires it...yippee? Sad. People screaming vaccine countries, almost half (about numbers election) get it. sad. Good. Let's finish this! Keep scratching! way. Yeah almost. looking view merges cases vaccinations one chart. wanted make strong case front non vaccine enthusiast friends show two data points correlate number active cases falling people getting vaccinated started exporting vaccines weeks ago stats feel really weird article. place seen NH 85% adults getting first shot (i live NH). could sworn US 50% adults first shot well. ask neighbors feel mask ending. might surprised neighbors ready de-mask. 

I neighbor special needs walks lot neighborhood dogs free, diligent wearing mask staying away people walks. thought dogs could get covid. 
Yesterday back 2019 behavior chatting close everyone without mask. wanted protect dogs. thought sweet would never known ask. ""Singapore Variant"" came India.  want contactless deliveries last forever, that's sure. Oh know, reading boost declining, huge segment population day. making joke. already registered lotto well lol girlfriend lives Guelph, &amp; we've seen since border shut down. absolutely crippling mental health. hang every bit good news &amp; continue hope best! July open date would met open (vaccinated) arms. non vaccinated liars among us? fully vaccinated won't. COVID good thing, no. China's enforcement anti freedom speech deep people believe is. criticise almost anything, huge following criticises government golden. personally believe defence mechanism monopoly information West internet, that's China creates alternative platforms slowly integrating foreign netizens sphere create rival platforms YouTube Facebook (just speculation).

You quick Google search see protests happen lot China (usually) violently quashed like past, Chinese authorities gotten lot experience know consequence harsh actions. 

And that's Chinese government properly compensate people relocated megaprojects, people things complain. village getting flooded, get live place much better infrastructure, opportunities standards living well pretty good lump sum money fairly good deal rational person's mknd. wrong, people died covid vaccinated.  rare happened hundreds times.  went back Indiana visit family 25% compliance. annoyed trying mold trip around antimaskers left early. I'm hoping things stay now, shall see. Wearing mask winter keeps face warm sounds great Yup. would shocked small incentive people need get vaccinated. company survey average incentive needed $30, amongst people answered going get vaccinated. matter : look unvaccinated must wear mask. fully vaccinated care wear mask not. 

see? simple.  said I‚Äôm anxious? Proceeding caution reasonable thing do. 

Why trying turn dick-measuring contest ready get back normal? F. back pains I'm early 20s potentially see minor spikes death rate remain flat.

 Locally (Memphis, TN) nearly 70% vaccination rates ages 65+, represent 75% deaths. 25% county population 18 0 deaths. We've gone 7-day average 17 deaths per day 3 months ago (Feb 6), 2 deaths per day 2 months ago (March 18) we've maintained level below.

Daily 14-day average cases per 100k dropped 90 December 13 late February we've held that. anticipate spike go 30, unlikely spike even cause discernable jump 14-day average. I'm sure factors involved Michigan, see unlikely repeat here.

The NYT risk levels based cases per 100k follows:

&lt;1: low risk

1-3: moderate risk

3-11: high risk 

11-45: high risk

45+: extremely high risk


To put words, doubt TN get 'high risk' 2021, also doubt TN jump extremely high risk. sub cultish following people attack anyone suggests covid even slightest chance risk children. 

I think normal people frequented sub year mostly left vaccines slowing spread easing fears. remains hard line deniers and/or skeptics.

All I'm suggesting consider entire population easing mask guidelines. That's it. Somehow I'm raging hardline fanatic. There's downside whatsoever continue masking September, I've got people trying tell kids wearing masks 4 months somehow going stunt development life. Give fucking break. make less idiot. Right.  said anything. literally hundreds years data flu, deaths short/ long term effects. Covid like flu virus, vascular disease don‚Äôt know affect children adults long term even asymptomatic. going let kids get covid chance current issues relatively small (though one kids may / may not) don‚Äôt know long term effects. Time time rules policies released assume rely public behavior fool knows happen. opinion, defective policies bureaucrats generate incompetent held account.

For now, proper policy get vaccine part...or take chances...and shame threat others. Every headline I've ever seen Ohio sounds like Parks Rec episode. Yes! told husband day, young kids can't vaccinated yet one high risk. need safe time shop now... like high risk people beginning pandemic. already scoliosis can't say feel fine hearing this, expected bad knees lmao thought given people getting vaccine. wish luck hope winü•∞ Much love California Go Canada! Go!!! Seeing much normal US feels things starting open makes super excited folks! Well, people play stuff like Powerball tops 100 mil play dream.

People dropping $100 grocery money scratch tickets gambling addicts. hard book appointment due demand.

It late last month, things like draw people fence it. Give months see similar situations Canada 60% people least dose 40% wanna get it. June 15th date picked April 6th. 

‚ÄúWhat triggers move Beyond Blueprint?
On June 15, California fully open economy two criteria met:

1. Equitable vaccine availability: vaccine supply sufficient Californians 16 years older wish inoculated. [i]
AND
2. Consistently low burden disease: Hospitalizations stable low, specifically, hospitalizations among fully vaccinated individuals low.‚Äù

‚Äú[i] Vaccine supply sufficient eligible individuals wanting vaccine obtain appointment receive inoculation within 2 weeks.‚Äù

1. achieved goal. walk appointments many places. want make appointment I‚Äôm sure find one miles away within next week. 

2. clear. ‚Äúhospitalizations among fully vaccinated individuals low.‚Äù believe true. ‚ÄúHospitalizations stable low‚Äù - one doesn‚Äôt specify threshold it‚Äôs clear there. 

When Newson announced June 15th several times since (even last Thursday) mentioned ‚Äúby June 15th‚Äù keeping door open shift sooner. However attached mask mandate date. imagine really hard move date now. seat belt great analogy - you‚Äôre required wear one don‚Äôt major crash shitty unsecured body becomes projectile harm others well greatly increasing risk death. fully vaccinated since January, ive one wearing mask gym since started going shortly that. CDC guidelines changed, figured i‚Äôd still wear it. COVID, it‚Äôs pretty effective getting random people talk I‚Äôm working out. Yesterday, however, opposite effect. old dude came one sets told I‚Äôm going get carbon MONOxide poisoning working mask, one friends collapsed Walmart wear mask. Old people Florida woooooorst @ Phil Murphy Registration everyone opens May 31 Lithuania, cant wait üíâ sort did, nobody reported top 5 states actually pretty close actually seen comments viral tweets people say done research regarding masks vaccinated people think CDC right. absolutely shocking cannot see irony. severe COVID symptoms due autoimmune response actual virus? Funny antivax opinions go window soon there‚Äôs money involved.  things point leaving mask mandates place kids chance get vaccinated. 

Not according CDC's battery experts. yes, according random internet person.

I'll trust experts science, thanks. time day dictate get downvoted hell saying live Lewis County, and, despite conservative demographic, crushing too! China knew since August. knew bad enough lock people homes stop spread beginning December. no. China lie. China always lies. Like every nation planet. per capita.

Edit: yes seems evidence points ""I talking ass"" good asking sources. find interesting tidbits process worrying nonetheless.

Infants fetuses seemed higher risk developing issues cardiovascular system still developing vulnerable covid.

I found 2-6% kids multisystem inflammatory syndrome requiring intensive care. apparently kill them, bad news.

The worst outcomes seemed reserved kids existing cardiovascular issues, known unknown. there's good bit kids, especially toddlers category. Even son, seems perfectly healthy moment, cardiac anomaly young.

As long term effects exposure virus, find much, probably still early. worried though, knowing long term risks exposure virus. think best play safe possible assume generally kill children completely safe come contact virus.

There small noticeable percentage kids existing conditions make vulnerable virus, kids might know conditions mild enough undiagnosed. Since asymptomatic kids absolutely spread disease like crazy, puts kids great risk. takes empathy understanding ""the needs many outweigh needs few"" seems sorely lacking US today.

People seem assume similar diseases like flu, ISN'T. novel thing know expect long term. People jump ""It kill children"" ""It's totally safe kids get it"" rather easily. safest thing make sure *few people contract possible*, large chunks US population fucking stupid short sighted understand 129 kid study... 


How many kids get covid know? likely lots test symptoms. 


And like long flu thing either. Most? mask mandate Dallas since March 10th. business decide require it. Yes convince half america taxes worth it. I‚Äôm reading guidelines fans returning England Sunderland‚Äôs site saw vaccinated must still take tests (in order attend) still potentially catch transmit virus. 

Seriously? still borderline anti-vax talking sheds say...

And wife? lot people incentivized prospect possibly winning $1 million convictions truly getting vaccine.

yep. think would work even better feds, one person $100M, 5 $10M, 50 $1M, 5000 $10,000 hate everyone picture frame sort. 

Why? I‚Äôm hater. always gets overlooked. Oh come on. act suppressing people's right voice opinion good thing. reason Chinese people care can't protest, never protest. village flooded make room dam sent without proper compensation. might legal claim portion profit Great news Canada. Sadly surprised USA youre vaccinated, you‚Äôre good. sniff covid lines unvaccinated asshole, fine.

That‚Äôs there‚Äôs guidance. calculus vaccinated fine unvaccinated deal whatever happens. Good you. believe asking for, adjust show state choose 'businesses continue require masks' vs 'businesses ask proof vaccination wear mask' I'd definitely prefer former. wear mask data well vaccine protects immune compromised people. volunteer Belgium made site figuers less available public, person tweet is. like nice overview companies delivered belgium fidn , lots good information someone intrested that. find highly suspect, it‚Äôs true fuck yes Yeah, right. remember hearing that.

Probably going hell lot harder convince people get another vaccine. they're fine putting gasoline plastic bags. get antibodies tested? could dive study behind linked. talk relies people using ""app"" necessarily skews towards people report prospective observational cohort study COVID-19 symptoms subset 4182 users COVID Symptom Study app

That raw numbers suggest much lower Almost 500,000 UK children tested positive covid-19 since March UK advocacy group Long Covid Kids says currently details 1200 children long covid 890 families England. 

And point mild symptom persisting weeks unusual medical bodies say normally takes days weeks recover covid-19, make full recovery within 12 weeks.

But won't. I'm scientist neither you. experts. CDC full them. Go Superman, Americans truly reflection government, need policing taking care everything, point self harm free guns 

If really wanna get people like 100 raffles 10k rounds commercially avalible (IE buy like Cabela's Vances) ammo type person wants. ammo prices right absolutely get huge amount people interested way. add kurt angle mix, chances winnin drastic go down. Yup. guess pursue ideas highlights problems society, guess? Even going help society? Would reading new Michael Lewis book, Premonition. turns playbook get used.  Canadians already (visiting usa tribe vaccine). I'm guessing article open usa state (not Canadians got vaccines allowed linger U.S. returned home letters health officials exempting mandatory 14-day quarantine imposed entering country.  Yeah old 80/20 thing (pareto principle iirc) 80% revenue comes 20% customers. drug dealers, alcohol companies etc. small subset humanity primed addictions rest us fall sad, self-destructive habits. publish scientific data comes. Politicizing science past administration way sentence structured made think husband 14 minute. *proof combination vaccines lockdowns work. coming arse end one. won‚Äôt know reality little while. agree. many experts inflate risks get clicks air time scare people compliance. Scott told us bad news there's bad news good news there's good news. see name headlines, click every time seems able sort static. That's already happening parts US, ones high vaccination rates. Treating COVID like zero-sum issue partly CDC guidance inefficient. weeks ago? Wow read story even published ""fully vaccinated"" population skyrocket two months, people 30 eligible states month so, people 16 got eligibility. Plus, likely get full authorization Pfizer least (instead Emergency Use) start requiring public schools health care workplaces etc. 

But 85% Americans impossible without expanding eligibility...~15% Americans ineligible 12 years old, plenty people refuse get it. add this, herd immunity necessarily mean given percentage, means ‚Äúhigh enough virus cannot spread easily‚Äù. Nobody really knows herd immunity happen depends distribution immune non-immune. remember Trump placed amazon order named group politicians scared masks. antivaxxers terrified vaccinated people ""shedding viral particles"" they're going wearing masks.

Which...... reverse psychology works guess? mRNA vaccines viral particles them, created RNA strands made dissolved 24-36 hours felt like crap 2nd shot, gets unvaccinated people wear masks, complain. . hold it.

that's BS

unvaccinated (all) must wear mask, wash hands, safe distance.

not joke pal.

they 

ONLY fully vaccinated decide take mask off.  I've told doctors tests accurate get false sense security using them. need find correct one tests specific antibodies vaccine. Going ask specialist recommendation, reopen Rather, capacity limits removed soon, anxious stay masked another weeks, get numbers last summer levels so?

Is mask huge burden little longer? idea blackmailed right thing. alot started getting vaccines US recently likely spikes, possibly clusters unvaccinated people. Spiking numbers would require virus still spreading exponentially, fact appears *decaying* exponentially. 


? get CDC wants announcements scientifically accurate possible,

Oh, like beginning told us *not* wear masks even though countries wearing normal decades flu seasons, allergy seasons, even SARS. CDC told us wear masks worried shortages. 

Now, suddenly telling people fully vaccinated need wear masks last ditch effort motivate still hesitant get shots. 

The CDC longer seems impartial me; seem like agency agenda. age misinformation disinformation, mangled messaging untold amounts harm. mask made life miserable, much curfews closures restrictions. Yes im allergic masks cant wait go. Weirdly, think people weight rare negative positive outcomes same. true unvaccinated chances getting covid really bad reaction, possibly dying it, much higher chances winning lottery, latter much motivating reason.

Another point, kind random prize incentive used entice people answer surveys, donate local public radio, etc. really powerful tool, states use lottery system encourage vaccinations. Typically yes, variant random buck trend. reason variants transmissible thrive fairly obvious, lethality less so. deadly variants could kill hosts quickly, likely reason become common due community responding trying stop virus. 70% everywhere... 30% state.

And yes think would pretty reasonable keep masks schools/essential stores still allow vaccinated adults get back normal socializing businesses, kids parents young children easily avoid. lot unvaccinated still want mask. venn diagram, perfect circle. Plenty people scared vaccine covid. people told choose one. Also, great cop answer question. point year told need ‚Äúfollow science‚Äù (follow CDC), questions asked. ‚Äúscience‚Äù says people take masks states still want keep mask mandates.

My point hypocritical. cant say follow science, questions asked, sudden 180 science says something dont like. doesnt work like that.

Bye Felicia No, stupid. Long term side effect life 100% probability death. people fatigued dragging scientifically illiterate populations 21st century. They've spent last 15 months trying convince people wear mask still refuse. Welp, people want vaccine got vaccine. feel bad 10% got got vaccine still feel covid, someone gets covid point havent taken vaccine thats them. think going win üòâ Excellent! path normalcy. 60% U.S. received least one dose. Add already COVID close. Better get r/Coronavirus, sub pretended care year doesn‚Äôt anymore. article makes think stories Planned Parenthood woman comes abortion still sits complains doctor whole time evil doctor PP are. imagine 'late entries' probably thing, getting jab talking they're taking poison chance money. What‚Äôs point President CDC telling us it‚Äôs okay drop masks private businesses going opposite? solution exclude people society

If path vaccination adult stage acting antisocially excluded. unlike people cannot vaccinated legitimate medical concerns.

Who people? want start saying: love Ohio. Whenever someone makes low-hanging-fruit joke no-one wants in/visit/live Ohio, first defend it.

I also want overtly-political comment. may tones, that's reality situation.

My experience Ohio likely relatable target audience vaccine initiative. I've certainly Cleveland (the change Cleveland 90s great), born/raised/and continue strong family ties middle-of-nowhere, cobblestone main street, rural Ohio.

I love towns, love quiet peaceful are, love ""slow"" is, friendly everyone town. backhanded compliments, either. someone lived good chunk life internet became thing, real appreciation ""disconnected"" life (even rural towns form high speed internet now).

But quaintness nostalgia towns end construction population density. people areas amazing economic situations smaller cities/bigger towns actually pretty well-off time. industries built abandoned them, lot ..... policies .... decisions made pushed people kept there.

Unfortunately, people convinced cause downturn was... well, anyone anything actual cause. So, there's deep-seated hatred anger fear, yeah, sucks. know people personal level, know, one-on-one situation, bad people. need help... Needed it, long time ago, never coming. 

So yeah, they'll jump getting vaccine small hope economic recovery, angry masks vaccines never masks vaccines.

(and yeah, know could sort make kind comment many places America, true, kinds situations throughout country, sad others, specifically Ohio, or, least, experiences Ohio) problem journalists ask kinds questions. journalist asks scientist public policy worker ‚Äúcan vaccinated people still spread virus‚Äù, yes/no question, even ‚Äúcan rule transmission vaccinated person‚Äù, person answering probably answer yes/no format add ‚Äúthose things possible since don‚Äôt know enough yet‚Äù. 

But rejected question took control saying ‚Äúif you‚Äôre looking yes/no need rethink; still acquiring data based success trials encourage everyone get vaccinated‚Äù. 

Don‚Äôt let journalists frame tricky issue like that, messaging gets screwed up. I‚Äôm sure trust vaccines, clarify I‚Äôm fully vaccinated anti vaccinator, don‚Äôt get downvoted hell don‚Äôt understand everyone forgets kids. 

Because 70% adults vaccinated, kids would still issue. Outside keeping mask mandates schools, public transit, hospitals, done kids unvaccinated? enforcing mandates vaccinated every public situation solution.  almost like people different bodies Korea Taiwan Vietnam India etc

Peak probably lower previous waves since even low vaccination states, there's still close half vaccinated previously people want read whole thing, enough time, watch video: incentive here, saw well researched video. Rocket Surgery joke that's around while. one fun phrases makes people stop wonder speaker clever...or moron.

""Be careful virus samples"" nothing us. Export vaccines north, import people south. That's poor logistics. difference make, talking percentages 

Math hard huh catch covid ya know. Anti-bodies stay long. american boasts getting point almost laughed ridiculed I've fascinated attached people masks. get immune compromised still real concern. vast, vast majority develop antibodies vaccine, basically bio hazard suit.

I think hard people trust invisible. CDC knows anti maskers also shed masks, always irresponsible less new damage one might think. there's non lottery people. Whenever I'm small town one Lions club car draws. always buy ticket. Odds 1 100k something? often play National lottery small lottery especially charity I'll throw money Also grew Ohio.

They might seeing firsthand big problem don‚Äôt see know anyone‚Äôs who‚Äôs gotten sick, therefore may feel less inclined get vaccinated something don‚Äôt perceive risk threat. Going forward, hope there'll tolerance people wearing masks anything communicable (cold, flu) suffering hay fever etc.

Many people east Asia already routinely wear face masks reasons. particularly appreciate social concern anyone wears one they've got sniffly bug. Tried Canada (in Times) people looked though I'd grown second head. Well fair US far far worse covid outbreak deal domestically Russia China go reported numbers. mean China apparently like 20 people get coronavirus according government course extra vaccine spare!

They've also worrisome metric increases recently.  Lol sorry tailored comment better reddit people... mean china uses fear control population. neccesarily related virus general. U.S. sensational response virus example using fear control population. job, CDC's abdicated responsibilities order part popular. easy detect; opposite sex it. 37% number referring received doses, received doses waited 2 weeks. like KF-94 quite lot. similar Korean standard. tried KN95 one 2 brands tried uncomfortable (earloops way tight). issue bottle contains multiple doses giving one dose OP's aunt without backlog appointments wait list rest would mean vaccine doses could go waste, pharmacist would likely get trouble (they probably standing orders waste certain amount back supply constraint rather demand) People used risk management transmissible diseases, especially respiratory ones.

Yup, really want better, ""how stop covid"" type sub, one you. still seemingly place debate ""is really problem?"", people want talk ""not getting vaccinated"", ""not wearing mask anymore [insert arbitrary reason]"". 

There much much less going places like /r/CoronavirusUS especially /r/COVID19. No, CDC may give similar recommendations, same. extremely ignorant (and american) view. I'm US, CDC worldwide organisation. is. pressure put investigate origins, pandered china trusted word CCP. past, pandemics recognised countries infections. time, waited whole world infected call it. influences countries decision making travel kills people proxy. this? China bully use influence (and bribes) force WHO's hand protecting reputation.

The much involved worldwide geopolitics medicine, worldwide organisation unlike plausible reason that's consensus medical advice globally time?

No. person biomedical science degree, somebody literally worked PCR machines (Which diagnose COVID-19 identifying SARS-COV-2 DNA), ALWAYS wear mask gloves even prior pandemic. well known contaminants aerosolize cause infection, knew 10+ years ago swine flu epidemic. Perhaps CDC copied WHO, guidance set pandering China. can't comment bad advice given CDC, know whole deal ""Don't wear mask, work"" CDC set avoid shortage masks. TERRIBLE caused lot people lose faith masks.

The also set recommendations early pandering China. talking worldwide pandemic, quietly spreading.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm saying CDC pro China (though may well be). I'm explicitly talking WHO. really care, willing mind changed, happily reference timeline shitty decisions made early on. truthfully think even provided hard evidence, argue it. Helping critical thinker understand worth time, views set stone, like many others online, what's point. know SARS-CoV-2 worse HIV, though. @ GovHawaii much longer? Reminds reinfection craze last summer/fall. Couple acquaintances knew 5-10 people gotten multiple times. dig little deeper story usually, ‚Äúwell, fever cough October 2019 didn‚Äôt get tested, thought immune! tested positive last week!‚Äù

I feeling thing happened here. Either people lied vaccinated, caught doses (much likely second dose). said people vaccinated don‚Äôt need wear masks science supports this. it‚Äôs states, cities businesses make policies based information. conservative like California, liberal rules like Texas. 

I doubt know better bunch public health experts You‚Äôre awesome. Second shot tomorrow! LETS GOOOOOO end day surprised real actual covid deaths half official claim  
  
So surprised half excess deaths 2020 result lockdown related measures? honestly sound reasonable mind? comment downvoted, cool. People cruel. know pandemic hit areas country immediately, time, right? Time distance known concept you? take pound alarm ounce regret.

In case though like four tons alarm. Vaccines rolling well better expected, literally starts crying scared is?

No employer able truly solve problem commute. employers able mitigate offering commuter benefits. Many able this. unfixable problem employers. try pay more, many cities cannot keep increasing traffic increasd price housing (and therefore...your employers move farther away in-person location).

Sure benefits in-person collaboration many employers going find 100% in-office work hard sell long run. People want commute every single day avoid it.

Pretty much, it‚Äôs honestly ridiculous early starting this, like opened closed places still waiting lists etc. live va I'm 1b, I've shots 3 week wait ends weekend.

I suppose I'd agree covid much, much deadly brutal (\~2% mortality rate US I've seen). acknowledge benefits vaccine, particularly high risk actively engaging high risk folks, also recognizing fact everyone US condition may require vaccine low risk good health. perhaps they'd like wait see effects new type vaccine?

Reporter: ‚ÄúNo.... reporting that‚Äù

Amazing stupid sounds, isn‚Äôt it? Thanks info! got appointment tomorrow evening, hopefully everything go well! &lt;3 Well course large enough population 100% unsustainable. **vast vast majority** people prevent always outlier, already outliers. else going spread virus? Yes... is? Government entities mandate masks. small government.. antiauthoritarian. Personally, I'll choose wear mask though. really think though? sounds like dicatorship  Yep. mandate wenT flames Friday. got told 5 PM day ‚Äúrecommend‚Äù masks, require them. busy public workplace, happily, still 95% masked kids adults weekend early week. Tfw also American state still plans remove mask mandate It‚Äôs also generally true people get covid test positive antibodies many months afterwards. Meanwhile, patients don‚Äôt. Exactly. get behind people spreading straight lies vaccine. someone allowed express choosing get vaccine trust immune system fight covid. don‚Äôt know feel need ban well. Texas Governor party intentionally endangering children? Trump develop vaccine. Seems fair say unlikely we'd see within year thing started especially given relatively unproven nature rna vaccine type. Lockdown work long term. Works perfectly reducing hospital getting overran. believe nurses top level scientists/doctors cdc? hmmmm Go ahead. remember wear mask though. Nope official guidance symptoms cleared days something like that.  It‚Äôs like many months now. 

The 90 days everyone remembers form monoclonal antibodies Covid protocol (passive vaccination). Well I'm glad Biden's sending millions doses countries may need them. think that‚Äôs mostly due lack testing abilities/facilities early pandemic? if‚Äôs really think it‚Äôs necessary ban people social media saying ‚ÄúI trust immune system fight covid‚Äù ? Maybe time use illogical reverse psychology s***, like saying eating small amounts Indian food build immunity potential Indian variants seems like written middle schooler, based tone language choices.

I'm vaccinated unmasked. mind whatsoever others continue wearing masks. would ask someone else take mask off? 

Just weird around. mandated lockdowns mask wearing doesn‚Äôt beat highly contagious virus? telling thing beat virus either get vaccine fight virus naturally??

I utterly shocked /s

This social media toxic, people believing lockdowns masks eradicate virus, never case credentials? waiving fines CV violations affect numbers one way other? currently enforceable CV restrictions anywhere FL, exactly reckless here?

Also, saying numbers ‚Äòuncomfortably‚Äô high pretty subjective. currently walk almost CVS Publix state get vaccine want it. don‚Äôt, that‚Äôs you. live densely populated part FL people (and frankly months) done restrictions. CDC dropped news last week pretty much every business took signs go wherever want mask free. guessing titles articles? one hospitalized adults looking many adults hospitalized covid-19 prior history vaccination it. RIGHT??!! Right?

Maybe pitch fit loosen felt numbers high enough nurses seem massive cornerstone American anti-vaxx movements really evidence claim, generally true people get covid get tested it. See article November 2020 (I would guess % infected tested risen since then): 53 million people U.S. likely Covid-19 end September, according modeling estimate researchers Centers Disease Control Prevention. Roughly 6.9 million infections confirmed within time period, suggesting roughly one every eight cases identified. happened February, though surgical masks. grocery delivery work home. Maybe picked outside mail pavilion, knows. I‚Äôm jealous need to?

Worry mind business. Meh see nothing wrong Hawaii wanting vaccine passport. Hawaii remote can't risk COVID-19 outbreak relaxed border. perfectly justifiable case. really doubt high schools require vaccination. can't find schools said would. buddy mine experienced elevated heart rate due stress day shot. stress combined vaccine symptoms caused pass twice, never happened before. I'd say take easy you. Americans perhaps sadly global south still largely unvaccinated. #FakeNews reads like delusional rambling, I‚Äôm sorry pandemic impact really hope you‚Äôll able get past it. We‚Äôre waning months covid, hold tight you‚Äôll see might asshole, challenge make point using mainstream, commonly accepted sources. 


If case strong, case easy make, right? Man glad went Hawaii then. Italy, Brazil, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, South Korea, UK. reporting things crime now? thought 90 days Covid guidance get vaccine Covid? so, months good length wait. noted debated disputed (the lab theory) linked it.

Man asshole, I'm even going try, clear got open mind. March Taiwan gets AZ Korea India.  really? doubts vaccines efficacy safety, would logical want masks primary mitigation measure instead vaccines. Thank going continually benefit society whole. Sorry go that. woman article steroids immunosuppressants. wasn‚Äôt immunocompromised. way hit 85% vaxxed super variant comes kills 80% unvaxxed population. Alright, i'll tell gf random guy internet said def flown Belgium twice past 6 months. Isn‚Äôt increase efficiency proportional first dose? I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs coming right. Basically, dose 1 creates X additional dose adds always less X. 

Law diminishing returns whatever. One coworkers India lost father covid. Best wishes you. People immunosuppressants (like first woman) people cancer/weakened immune systems likely appropriate immune responses vaccine. That‚Äôs vaccines work.  rate ease transmission problem, mortality otherwise zero data show would actually make difference elsewhere

No, understand/are misinterpreting data provided you.

I assure professionals studying epidemiology likely longer alive much firmer grasp science do. that's ok. start trying convince people professionals wrong looked chart, look like 0.001% chance getting car accident every day got car go somewhere would never drive again?

Talk car accidents spread via droplets. Deaths hospitalizations plummeting faster cases 85% age 65 vaccinated least one shot. single digit deaths number new hospitalizations low. Furthermore anyone wanted vaccine month get good appointment availability, one shot blame don‚Äôt prevent private businesses want. I‚Äôm vaccinated happy wear mask, store wanted to, I‚Äôd put on. It‚Äôs place follow rules must've looked crystal ball saw timeline majority. pose kind threat health?

Nope, you‚Äôre vaccinated. That‚Äôs they‚Äôre for. negative effect others?

There‚Äôs possibility infected spread vulnerable people. Or, could die too. 

Everyone doesn‚Äôt get vaccinated get covid. they‚Äôre rolling dice whether they‚Äôll live die it, also whether they‚Äôll long covid complications it. choice theirs. Get vaccinated get covid. hope they‚Äôre selfishly meeting people unable get vaccinated whatever reason. that, know risks that‚Äôs them. Watch Canada UK want preview Indian strain do. commend wearing mask forever. safest thing do, small ask. Anecdotally, grandmother stroke 2 weeks day second Moderna shot. Anyone fewer reduced side effects second dose? 

First dose arm hurt like hell well week. Second dose felt better day. work jail, airflow nonexistant. Probably immune system strong lol I've two last week still see masks least people.   North Texas here, Kroger 50/50 last time there.  Maybe they‚Äôll get naturally vaccinated mean fitting rooms open back up? 55% frustrating? wanna wear masks still let Jesus Christ stop telling people live lives ffs. claimed based official CDC data website. anyone confirm correct?

Yes: High-Risk Severe Illness   COVID-19 flu illness result severe illness complications. highest risk include:  adults  certain underlying medical conditions  people   risk complications healthy children higher flu compared COVID-19. Things already open part. keep wearing masks rural areas cities different. Well that's whole point, right? That's CDC recommendations include continuing mask things like mass transit in-person schools. 'construction sites' metaphor. Scientists billions dollars funding made - every - vaccines; gods involved.

Religion reason getting vaccine, also shouldn‚Äôt take credit away real human beings worked asses make 0 divine intervention. Define ""Hella sick"" go hospital. what's statistic would result getting ""Hella sick"" Phizer Moderna vaccine Never thought hearing would upsetting go everyone without mask say ‚Äú thank voting Trump.‚Äù get offended say ‚Äúoh I‚Äôm sorry. weren‚Äôt wearing mask. assumed vaccinated.‚Äù I'm going wear mask store still signage asking so. Florida?  Many people unfortunately tied politics identity virus. extremely frustrating see claim believed science push back second guess science. Definitely going take time, think social pressure fit move people start recycling masks. Short sweet. Preserve innocence. weeks

I highly doubt I'm ok that, get hand since hospitals know treat exposed population much scarce, including u vaconnated folks wear makes and/or social distance. would preferable happening India would still far far ideal. US EU back life normal China welding apartment doors shut can't supply enough vaccines would still bad look Chinese government. Obviously probably worst case scenario far best well. vaccine evading variant spawned.  totally agree. really pissed reopened schools children choice (because old enough). opted homeschool son get vaccinated (hopefully September). Makes ton sense. lot people around starting get vaccine appointments squared away getting first doses. Give us month we'll lot people safely vaccinated ready get back normal. work healthcare lab actually work COVID specimens throughout SoCal we've definitely noticed declining numbers past months jumped all-time high late last year. Give another month really good shape current trends. 

I've mine since late January due working healthcare, totally understand waiting majority population catch get back pre-pandemic status. I'm glad there's potential light end tunnel right now, can't wait able get later summer. Till then, I'll continue wearing mask consideration others. They‚Äôre idiots, that‚Äôs right guess. long don‚Äôt force neurotic tendencies onto state mandate. Standing line right second round. Cries Texas. We've ""open"" since March city (and others) kept mandates matter individual choice freedom, he's welcome wants problem it.

It's piece fucking fabric someone else's face. Unless got hate speech swastika it, cares. get ""individual choice freedom"". exercise ""individual choice freedom"" wears green shirt versus red one, he's getting fucking dressed.

Everyone examining shit hard. ""therapy"" millions vaccinated Americans doing? fully vaccinated wear mask small stores see kid, default, mask outdoors since yesterday. you? wear masks? honest, friends here.  Yes, please got vaccinated stopped wearing mask outside legal so.  OK wearing masks indoor public spaces space crowded.

You're good, bro. That's sensible respectful, good job. Hopefully numbers crater worry masks anymore funny cause cant. article good though. Presents case getting vaccinated clearly. 

These sort headlines vaccine sceptic people might click on, world needs everyone possible take vaccine order slow new variants. Calling people dumb laughing builds resentment rather changing minds. vaccine this?

Anecdotally, physician, colleagues seen number strokes PEs mRNA vaccines population.

I don‚Äôt know related incidental. thrombotic risk assessed initial trials mRNA vaccines reveal? painfully obvious people actually read article.  Literally since said unmasked buildings vaccinated, rarely seen anyone nose hanging out. used see much it‚Äôs weirdos take off. Oh yeah Okay, limits due actual pandemic threats? Denton County recorded 10 deaths today isn‚Äôt clear nothing add. still wouldn‚Äôt get anyway. that‚Äôs fine! people like spoon fed think themselves. good numbers reality strikes directly affected it. reason assume random? Seems like weeks anyone grabbed appointment first week would fully protected.

I booked appointment first day available Long Beach, fully protected Saturday. gives weeks buffer everyone go without masks. choosing get vaccinated plenty time date. winter curfew didn‚Äôt restrict freedom movement. free go anywhere time long didn‚Äôt meet anyone outside household unless helping child care/sick care, etc. curfew applied non-household gatherings, non-essential businesses inside dining/drinking businesses.

You could get car drive, go walk, go grocery shopping get take out. also barely even enforced, enforced all. Re-read said. ‚Äúdue pandemic fears‚Äù part. It‚Äôs definition it‚Äôs accurate thank you. Maybe mean border America Mexico. friends fully vaccinated yet they‚Äôre still trying meet masks on...*sigh*.

It‚Äôs gonna take lot people lot time get used this. 

It‚Äôs kinda frustrating, one friends (we‚Äôre several weeks second dose) doesn‚Äôt even wanna order eat together. two us. Fully vaccinated. don‚Äôt get it...like believed vaccine enough get doesn‚Äôt believe enough protect her? Especially us vaccinated?? limits together, masked whole time. God forbid get hungry. Also sucks cuz she‚Äôll leaving country indefinitely, last time I‚Äôll see long time it‚Äôs going behind masks...and unnecessarily so...

I don‚Äôt know man, I‚Äôm tired this. So, tired. Yeah makes sense. 

For reason CDC decided worth risk allow people go unmasked vaccinated. 

If newly mutated strain vaccine resistant confirmed spreading US would happy put mask back far mutation confirmed. I'm sure loud proud   They‚Äôve June 15 picked awhile now, even CDC‚Äôs announcement. them? kids fine post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Edit: maybe trying back up, dunno. Text communication confusing respond difficulty using far many words :$ know they're big cities like Chicago, NYC, Houston, etc, I'd hardly call Oklahoma City Tulsa rural, ~1/2 ever saw wearing masks Target. definitely feel judgment. classic neanderthal thinking. 

WHAT WORLD LIVE IN. it. kid lied age would fully vaccinated people respond poll saying get vaccine? 

I think pretty obvious authors really mean *anti-mask* folks. I‚Äôm left leaning too, yeah, seen exactly same, it‚Äôs ridiculous. Honestly, it‚Äôs probably they‚Äôre busy harshly judging anyone see mask It‚Äôs 4 weeks. It‚Äôs end world. day of, saw people Costco suburb Chicago wearing masks. Like good 15-20%. kind Florida. wanted see walking usually took mine after. can't really enforce though. want people spend money guess that's choice they'd nuts deny sale. Exactly. Plenty locations get vaccine. Go right vaccines.gov tell vaccines impossible find within 2 days. I‚Äôll wait. Hence said relatively rare. 9.2K (of people got tested) eased restrictions said couldn‚Äôt bring virus home. 

You can‚Äôt cake eat too. absolutely bring virus home shown studies posted. even said tracked serious cases literally real data anymore reflects accurate risk bringing virus home, especially lifting mask mandates. Sometimes think take one catastrophic event whole company implode. believe various COVID relief acts congress passed, provision every employer provide minimum 14 days paid sick time related COVID. COVID vaccine counts that. employer legally required give paid time feel sick day vaccine.
Also, working home, probably symptoms severe can‚Äôt work. Unless hands deck deadline requires work long days, probably okay. Even great immune system can't cure stupid. God dammit. SICK KIDS. lol. sounds good I'll donate ASPCA win  Buddy need say making obvious jokes  sure relevance despite mask mandate. 

And absence mandate make difference people still wore masks, removing elsewhere? People unvaccinated already could take masks repercussions. What's difference? type health insurance many retail employees have, definitely need get vaccine. They, literally, afford get Covid. basically CDC. Fauci, OSHA looming make change think choice Second this. Also LA, took forever opened up. everyone really wants one able get one yet. know California huge state, right? world 7 billion people, awesome! still got cold something last year despite living alone wearing mask time. thing think picked touching door handles elevator buttons apartment building, touched nose taking mask walked inside apartment. think cold viruses spread surfaces lot better coronavirus does, wearing mask cause bit face touching unless remember wash hands first thing getting home. mind numbingly reckless

Couldn't possibly say anti-maskers anti-vaxxers. possible pattern there. look case involving Keyontae Johnson collapsed college basketball game timeout? said cause blood clotting I‚Äôm sure Covid related (he contracted covid prior taking place).  Something like what? realize businesses losing money everyday right? fuck

Give I'll take whatever shot want Yeah fact week later threw off. Good know something similar went away quickly Glad Biden‚Äôs taken much balanced approached reopening society.

Boris begging conspiracy theories this. Keeping things locked high vaccination low case numbers? Unforgivable. HIPPA means doctor health insurance company can't disclose medical info without consent. 

That's it. 

Unless dealing medical provider health insurance provider, HIPPA apply.  cult reality challenged individuals think vaccine still trials stop one contracting transmitting target virus savior.  Nope Hell no. day governor drops mandate burn. üòÜ Yeah honestly people acting like air toxic still. drive around neighborhood see people masks walking themselves, outside, one else sight. suppose could allergies something kinda sad. CDC ""science"" thing trusting science mean need believe CDC always right everything say infallible. many people live completely black white world, unbelievable news, water wet. though? fair CDC, nothing said states loosen mask mandates. last week, CDC criticized heavily way cautious specifically school reopening, summer camps, vaccinated people do

Now criticized much. get concern non vaccinated people - especially something like herd immunity isn‚Äôt something we‚Äôre going agree get - CDC guilty bad messaging anything. Personally, would‚Äôve waited safe tell everyone take masks rather society half wearing masks half Yeah experience Target Walmart west suburban Chicago going feel like different planet Publix smaller town Florida, example Yes did, smaller third. Like target anything stop anyways. Shit. I'm guy. hell children!   doesn‚Äôt Australia make vaccines? suppose really case Ireland. restrictions actual laws sunset clauses them. gave kids test run. sis-in-law family vaxxed, 3 kids. took house recently impressed son. cousins told still wears mask; grandma told take mask breathe better running around. shook head 'No' continued play mask entire time there. took store, mask entire time, touch face got hand sanitizer way out.

I faith kid keep mask goes school in-person September, hopefully they'll come vaccine age range then. social distanced wore masks. others wouldn't. 

I skeptical vaccine though. microchips anything stupid. I'm afraid potential side effects yet discovered. figured I'd wait bit longer. know others disagree this, whatever.

Anyway, sucks risk exposed going skyrocket higher ever due mask mandates lifted. Pfizer NZ elimination strategy Taiwan. day one told vital thousands tests every day. That's vital part maintaining elimination. Anyone even slight cold flu symptoms urged test. never problem false positives.

NZ done well. Sure, I'm saying massive testing wrong. costly fool-proof community spread. TW going today different NZ August, October, early year, etc. etc. That's I'm saying. 

Somehow there's much hate Taiwan's method targeted testing. worked quite well 100% perfect. Non-vaccinated people risk. Kids can't get vaccines. That's science.  Mistake Trump admin IMO kept him/not moved over. Young people apparently don‚Äôt understand effectiveness vaccines. kinda ... take 3 months get vaccinated. Meanwhile... take look Luxembourg ... already done vaccination! That's efficiency!  Every job this.  still change anything though. let vaccinated return complete normality also let anti-vaxxers overwhelm NHS? happens, everyone affected. come everybody forgets kids underlying conditions exist too? Considering \~0.2% US population died Covid-19, seriously doubt 0.5% people would die, especially since vulnerable (older fatter) likely already received vaccine. Mate need look mirror gullible you‚Äôve media Cant trust government. zuck personal info plans. making numbers here? numbers would suggest death rate 1 2 per ten million infected, sure that's want go with? signed kids up. Hopefully hear soon. wife this. like severe agoriphobia, better outings. Or...the mask mandate/recommendation stay effect hit targets age group. 12-15 got approved. Thank you. Covid made realize selfish people sheer amount comments disregarding minimizing health children nauseating Ehhh.... definitely dumb  I‚Äôm Ontario‚ÄîI got shot almost two weeks ago. week ago, entire family (parents, siblings, cousins, aunts, uncles) vaccinated first shot. Finally seeing light end tunnel. Can‚Äôt wait get second shot! mom confused news said need still wear masks vaccinated. (Her fully vaccinated)

I explained telling people vaccinated wear masks isn‚Äôt protect themselves, it‚Äôs protect unvaccinated people. 

Vaccinated people still get spread it, likely mild symptoms symptoms all, meaning unvaccinated people even higher risk vaccinated people stop wearing masks socially distancing. hate Hopefully 65+ demographics higher rate.   exactly capitalizing black white now? means, let come make scene. love see it. got time make biggest mistake day, least.  Government different. American private sector force pretty much anything long it‚Äôs crime discriminatory alarmist all, feel way Vaccinating kids wasn‚Äôt priority. priority elderly rightly so. priority vaccinating enough people country around world.

Children though near risk overall older adults underlying conditions Oh, we're certainly right track. we're *quite* yet. lot people seem extremely allergic erring side caution come worst pandemic century. weird me. downvoted oblivion. Guess downvoting? mask mandate close? subset conservatives fairly loud obnoxious vaccine hesitancy far evenly split reddit comment sections represent. Black brown inner city communities low uptake, variety reasons, traditionally don‚Äôt vote republican. still need mask state's mask mandate still place, probably vaccination % gets 70s 80s. Same. like wearing big sunglasses, makes feel less noticeable. hate showing face public love going great way accomplish goals. stupid think is; applaud playing game winning.  Anything possible. chances getting virus extremely low. Even Fauci said chances vaccinated person spread virus really low. chances die go hospital also low I'm picturing bunch liberals double masks hard hats summer trusting science hard. Yep Israel vaccine passport UK also using. US going country zero measures whatsoever place. washing hands either. ü§¢ people cried year conservatives wanting follow advice CDC regards pandemic. CDC saying something like, want cry too.

I know shit subject, followed recommendations, wore mask whenever public, limited exposure rarely going out, see parents full year, along many friends. CDC supporting loosening restrictions, including masks indoors, stated applies vaccinated individuals, quite obvious they'd fully aware unvaccinated people waiting chance take masks off. Despite that, CDC decided correct recommendation make. people lot educated situation me, absolutely issue following advice, wearing mask longer since I've vaccinated months now. 100+ year old legal decisions say state send cops house force vaccinated. Thay pretty much happens reddit. Also wait post older quite visible downvote everything like. USA! USA! USA! weeks ago sub wait get UK/Israel levels. Well guess UK still lockdowns countries still require indoor masking.  you‚Äôre saying kids greater risk pick someone bar? flu depending strain greater risk children point Ok still lied people state Oregon did, least larger cities. Oh wow, break bank. Good News, great Canada. US opened 12-17 age group. son got first shot today line school long hundreds per hour.  bounce US rate week. Nah, usless patent waiver important. Facebook worst thing history universe Follow science. metrics dropping like rock continue to. vaccines, combined natural immunity, work. vaccinated natural immunity break chain. Covid really hard time spreading.  vaccine stop anyone getting transmitting virus. effect mutations. People.need realize endemic going anywhere.
There little risk children, period. USA almost Yup   posted the\_donald, exactly shining beacon of...anything, actually. nothing ideology redeemable useful 2021 cases going down? places like Texas large percentage vaccinated, yet fully open, cases /deaths continue decline? think vulnerable vaccinated, even flare up, hospitalizations remain really low..and ones get covid, majority asymptomatic..USA seems almost defeated this. general much less skeptical doctors medical system arnt trying make buck us. work AU-NZ bubble? NZ opens done sees minimal COVID cases, bubble permit Australia? Yup. way incredibly ""political"" scientists talk climate change.

There response climate change political one. need public backing every national power earth get advances changing climate.

Incredibly depressing little understanding public policy science nation. countries like see. Wish state it. also cold shit lot places Canada indoor things open restrictions, winter terrible Um no, line thinking society flourish. advocating people feel sense responsibility infecting others virus, advocating people feel responsible viruses feel generally responsible health others around them.

&amp;#x200B;

How fuck could kill society? Caring others kills society? I'm opposite 

I think restricted airflow masking actually made asthma that's largely dormant years start acting Yes mostly trust assholes live state never said Canada fine, behind still behind US. Exhibit 1: [Percent first 2: [Average doses per worn mask target months. really sure sort prep would needed change.

Then commenting know? make sound like easy taking signs door down. bias. consistent praise US vaccination rate months Canadian media US's vaccination rate lot better. reporting reality, nothing more. Fantastic outlook. certain point, individuals make personal choices live consequences. ""America Bad"" headlines likely generate clicks, news outlets gravitate towards them. lot asian countries, pre-covid wearing masks norm sick and/or skies full smog. imo would prefer wear masks even getting herd immunity vaccines esp cold flu months, feel safer way nationwide long lasting technically get short lived mild forth wave states Exactly. whole pandemic traumatizing closest feeling war zone. Leave everyone alone. thing isn‚Äôt exactly yet unfortunately hate you. Oh sure. They're currently young. agree. respect take lot go either extreme. Instead, gives logical practical predictions align diseases human behavior work. Unfortunately seems case every headline. seriously wonder banning headlines certain subs would help. I'm aware bias Canada English speaking nations US. makes dumbass. takes literally 5 seconds look Texas COVID deaths Google see huge statistical reporting delay nothing more. state happen, I'd say thing. province opens 18+ tomorrow, I‚Äôll trying book appointment ASAP.

I think Canada get closer heard mentality America vaccine hasn‚Äôt politicized. 

America probably need kind financial incentive get stragglers keep getting steered different directions.....Dr Fauci says this, Biden says that. biggest question is- üí© Bill go? im starting lose trust tird munchers. kind understand coming from, although know tone said reserve judgement. bit unnerving go knowing everyone store without mask purposely ignoring safety guidelines designed help community stay healthy back normal. Like felt hella awkward walking around without mask gym, carried vax card case want workers think putting health risk minor increase comfort. Also town 30% vaccinated way 30% running around without mask even update, likely going close 100%. know really affect vaxxed, Idk feels weird. Same! actually went phobia treatment years ago, exposure therapy everything. year voluntarily got flu shot, Covid vaccine like nothing, doses started laughing hysterically literally didn‚Äôt even feel it. think I‚Äôve actually tackled needle phobia year, like.... one positive. they‚Äôre still gonna spread people process.  vaccines tho. work! Masks thing past soon. 

1 vaccine work even better clinical trials shown
2 works quite well variants, including Indian variant. 
3 highly unlikely get infected pass someone else.

Vaccines protect others stronger direct way masks do. want protect others, getting vaccinated likely help wearing mask ‚Äî course people still welcome both.

For unvaccinated enough hospital capacity whiteout overwhelming system get sick. 

And chip 5G works better, log windows without typing password.  Yep. I'm northern NJ seen single person age 2 *any* store without mask since April 2020. Idk compliance enforcement, going weird start seeing faces inside again. NZ never committed eradication. Elimination always going temporary, vaccine achieve herd immunity. simply matter waiting vaccination campaign fully rolled NZ. 

NZ getting doses well Australia mass campaign starting July peak numbers expected September November. may able open borders vaccinated people low-risk countries (which would likely include US) late 2021 early 2022. 

Ardern Bloomfield said live low levels Covid community borders opened, planned for. can't abandon elimination earlier would instantly lead exponential growth. Without vaccine elimination best strategy proven right following it. I'm sorry people going die this, fact government fell conservatives' misinformation campaign Quora. mainly trolling bad faith, government fell ignored sensible scientists disputing there. bad Hamburg, opened vaccination center people preexisting health conditions yesterday. They‚Äôve also announced they‚Äôre closing vaccination center around end July, implies people fully vaccinated end July. 

I‚Äôm really buying it, though. used two years worth good luck get appointment yesterday really got appointment computer error gave away extra 3,000 spots. Doesn‚Äôt matter, got impft ton people eligibility group calling booking service^1 people end zero clue new appointments available. means vaccination center fully booked week, maybe even end month. haven‚Äôt even opened 60-70 year olds yet, they‚Äôre probably going get first week June. Basically, going ton leftover people groups left duke general public somehow get appointment vaccination center closes. 

1: want appointment vaccination center, use really fiddly booking system prime example state technology Germany. also get vaccinated GP‚Äôs office obviously they‚Äôre going put patients first, doctor can‚Äôt vaccinate you, it‚Äôs difficult find one can. Like think spending full day calling different offices. kinds comparisons common Canadian media. Macleans Canadian media organization. malicious. 

Comparisons US made throughout pandemic. vaccination benefit US every time, really now. There's nothing wrong this.  cdc website children less affected COVID-19 compared adults, children infected virus causes COVID-19 children develop severe illness.‚Äù

It‚Äôs less risk adult know wouldn‚Äôt able live selfishness got kid extremely ill prevented basic simple measures.

Just get vaccinated asap odds far better state multistate lottery. 5 drawings boot! could really use it. stay inside hide. They're even close other; part effect somebody's diet maybe going tiny contribution costs like taxes society level

Might happen all, since people die heart disease much drain system people die cancer.  Happened state. Children resistant new strains (like one tearing Brazil right now). Kids low numbers ace-2 receptors, coronavirus uses get cells. newer variants beginning dominate bypass ace-2 receptors, children resistance strains.

Any stats last year basically date.  *Enforced* not, they‚Äôd signs stores saying ‚ÄúNo entry allowed unless wearing mask‚Äù, I‚Äôve seen almost every store days. true vaccine 100% hospitalization death? something less get virus?

I want get sick all. Especially since long covid thing. I‚Äôll take ten shots please husband fairly bad reaction first, reaction second besides sore arm. little reaction first, mild fever headache couple days second. got covid months ago Idk guess varies. Hell yeah, plenty. Take need pass on! continue morons vaccine resistant strain. Thanks fuck head. ask 2020... Literally relevant you‚Äôre vaccinated. I'm curious ""correct"" way extrapolate case is. seem like regular old linear regression would job. rich make vaccine lottery. I've already seeing this. Fuck morons. Yeah never gets old. Well, we're neighbors longest land border two interconnected sovereign nations. We're currently trying figure reopen border, United States supply glut Canada seems still position uptick high, following different strategies comparing - ie, even increased supply Canada, focusing first doses still think impactful protection - comparing results United States extremely interesting respect people genuinely can‚Äôt vaccinated health reasons. society put children last COVID-19. robbed year half education crucial social development. sure, matter choosing best bad options. quite callous it. Sure, technically good bad move time.  
;| people going needlessly die open vaccinated. however, vaccine readily available.  sorta choice point.  100% that's longer shop Target :-/   Well I'll counter Facebook earlier (mistake) morons still criticizing businesses mask policies place...

And still peddling hot garbage masks reducing one's O2 sat lying, easily provably false. Yikes. Major Yikes! I'm fully vaccinated that's sketch af... thank you. shopping better vaccination rate closer herd immunity! chance winning lottery way better winning actual one. expand 10 drawings already. People gonna get vaccinated. Lots people. keep wearing masks curbside shopping available big chain stores   Probably correct. mask wear winter going flu mask. mask wear crowded building ""y'all gross"" mask. forth. mean way grocery stores it. peak lockdown couldn‚Äôt check grocery store without mask. Now, CDC guidelines loosened different, felt though people without masks shouldn‚Äôt able check out. needed something could order pickup extra hassle. Whatevs got vaccinated Color shocked  Covid killed harmed unacceptable amount children (unacceptable population writ large), we‚Äôd perpetual lockdown.

No that's fucking stupid argument. Children vaccinated yet. risks drastically lower also transmitting unvaccinated populations, everyone's benefit. least people wait little. Unfortunately politics country already decided waiting others get vaccinated unacceptable. feel like veganism well LOL snooze lose, loser. Im already 100 doses. money's mine. *Ignites lightsaber* Bc can‚Äôt attend classes college doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll forced stay home county 70% eligible population partially vaxxed 59% fully vaxxed! California track! Omg true. They're going let go. think they're making victim narratives want attention. unironically.

Cars extremely dangerous, maim kill innocent people regularly, terrible environment. They're also hard get rid many cities built around need them, they're self-perpetuating problem.

The sooner they're gone (replaced mass transit self-driven electric vehicles), better we'll be. Summary:

I'm curious playing different workplaces.

Unlike internationals travelers, airline workers need 3 day quarantine, asked avoid crowded place quarantine over. Taiwan already incident pilot got sick caught going date mistress mall even though supposed go places. recent outbreak happened airline workers decided follow rules decided go visit red light district right 3 day quarantine.

But case looks like interpreting data yourself. statistician. know data collected comprehensive enough reading correctly though certain are. said asymptomatics often get negative result, know affected numbers. know barely anything data collected. 

I'm science denier. I've always supported global warming. vast majority experts believe global warning believe likely would play safe follow advice. virus, people supposed share science us outright lie change minds every second day. way interpreting data may accurate. find ego assume 100% right. risk versus reward there. risking permanent damage kids even death.

I'm actually retired civil engineer type catastrophic risk would taken (unless sadly people power force it) situation like this. probability catastrophe may low even close nonexistent. case better play safe case. Meaning kids miss 3 months school. 3 months. unvaccinated pose threat unvaccinated.

And unvaccinated children....yea CDC lost credibility.  Belgium 11mil people (for comparison) work EVERYWHERE! It‚Äôs catching last. need fatalistic thinking. Lots vaccines coming, vaccinated next couple months latest, 16 willing get shot. Take phone, call 5 different GPs find solution mom, too. good luck! I'm sure much longer hold out

Not much longer. fully expect next week announce immediate lifting remaining restrictions (there many tomorrow) except indoor mask mandate. He's also said allow emergency order expire June 13 long legislature acts (which really funding, restrictions).  probably around June 7 announce indoor mask mandate expire along EO June 13. expect us take CDC seriously literally said face masks work healthy people based science, flip-flop two months later? 1.5 million AZ, and... think 4 million doses Pfizer? think 4 million injected yet, started getting Pfizer across border Belgium alone 800.000 shots week.

We really starting get near full speed now.

It's close 100% effective preventing hospitalization death, really matters.

Not population vaccinated, 40% unvaccinated population.  That's corrected saying information outdated. Vaccine hesitancy gone significantly. true. disappointing see people good news. Far left dumb unscientific far right. point encouraging people would previously get vaccinated, isn‚Äôt it? think drastically overestimating individuals understanding statistics probability... take: want mask indefinitely, entirely choice respect it. Howeeeeever. also judge, give dirty looks, avoid maskless people like diseased rodents aka anti-maskers. reality people dropping masks they're vaccinated following science, want see judgey nonsense. long run healthy population work, make purchases, dole tax money.  100% coverage illness, like developed world.

You‚Äôre wrong; it.. ‚Äúare trying pretend obvious, hugely relevant fact isn‚Äôt fact?‚Äù vaccinated really, hospitalization death that's focus, infections even Sinopharm, infections asymptomatic. Prevention hospitalization matters course death. think one smart things it‚Äôll convince ‚Äúlite anti vaxxers‚Äù get it.

By ‚Äúlite anti vaxxer‚Äù, I‚Äôm referring someone skeptical vaccine misinformation heard, isn‚Äôt die hard conspiracy theorist.

They may see lotto opportunity go get vaccine, continue deny vaccine safe, secret wanted chance becoming millionaire.

And I‚Äôm okay that. stats continue rise vaccinated people helps herd immunity.

Hell I‚Äôve couple ‚Äúlite anti vaxxers‚Äù work admit got vaccine HR announced anyone would get extra vacation day. worried infected get vaccinated?? Let people make decisions  great read talks stuff we're going dealing long time. fewer people dying mean whole thing over. wow, thats expected. FYI, EU 450 mil population. Good them. Already seen first hand Keeps roughly line close group friends 7/10 want vaccinated, 3 don‚Äôt want mainly ‚Äúpolitical‚Äù reasons.

People fucking dense. course pointed get (at least July 4th; may get eventually).

I'm convinced we'll get ever, unless something major changes like widespread employer mandates.

We're going end May around 63% end June probably around 64%. Orange County California like Florida west. China getting rocked right now? 

Any evidence edgy opinion? Young people demand this, maybe some. law making vaccinations compulsory violates basic human rights. Same.

Basically sticking around see businesses dropping masking requirements, watch daily case count nosedive.

Oh dunk people ate antivaxxer propaganda vaccines don‚Äôt work well enough take masks.

I heard Australian Guardian podcast government want vaccinate everyone, also wait six months make sure vaccines safe new virus strains. FFS.

It's probably important remember Federal election next year, current government want lockdowns then.

I talked Australian relatives friends‚ÄîI live Germany now‚Äîand seem pretty happy it. weird. Thanks hope! :) Yet 's simple logic it. vaccines approved EUA. Even look effective promising, change fact still approved per EUA. emergency use meant directly risk. young people, especially minors, seem much directly affected covid. There's nothing it. antivax conspiracies. people waiting vaccines get fully approved, least current vaccine technology high tech never used large scale.

For sure covid vaccines fully approved, emergency use per EUA (but peer reviewed 4th phase trial stats), vaccination rollout even questioned anymore, even minors. covid vaccine become one general vaccinations. next that, fully tested use mRNA technology shown, next step lot vaccinations. Except virus spread mutate freely (you still infect others vaccinated, lesser degree), takes right mutation render vaccine almost useless.

As long considerable part population isn¬¥t vaccinated, pandemic won¬¥t over. election next year, government want outbreaks spoil things.  Seems like he's everything modifying mask mandate avoid addressing  39% population vaccinated

80% hospitalizations occurring among unvaccinated people

If think vaccine somewhat effective biased plain simple. experts wrong needing mask, administrative/social issue. easy way prove whether someone vaccinated not, people lie vaccination status avoid wearing masks. No

Cloth, one changeable filter pad. know actually long term effects health? Covid.

Sometimes does, sometimes doesn't.

Look, got vaccinated. patience people *broadly* anti-vaccination, suggest vaccines around decades filled mercury cause autism whatever. That's plain ridiculous. 

We've made deductions based understanding mechanics vaccines work, history tell us vaccine side effects usually appear relatively short term time frame. fact remain one really knows sure, basis observations, negative side effects could appear longer term Covid vaccine. sympathy people hesitant might consider getting Covid vaccine years line.  ""We healthiest citizens!""

That's unfortunately they're saying. U.S major Western **economies**

Economies key word there. want maintain economic advantage. happens particularly dependent healthy labor force compared tertiary economies Europe US. There's WFH iPhone assemblers.  Shit's bad small portion country billion densely packed people, poor public health/hygiene, major wave hitting vaccinated.  ...they've already done that, though? *was* investigation cockblocked China.

‚ÄãYes Taipei far denser, density alone cause massive spread. [Scientific article question density Covid spread. basic point density issue crowding.

Meanwhile lower-density neighborhoods Queens Bronx seen higher rates infection death.

‚ÄãHaving higher density Taipei guarantee faster spread, may increased risk level. simply means even greater need regular surveillance community testing catch clusters could get control. Density can't explain number jumping 20-30 300 couple days unless virus already spreading. 

Contact tracing alone enough people lie, case mentioned. NZ August February clusters saw multiple people mislead contact tracers, conceal meetings, act totally advice visit churches gyms uni lectures infectious. That's extra testing NZ constant baseline. 2019, 8 million people travelled China Taiwan. 6 million fro HK, another 6 million South Korea Thailand combined.

States restrictions without restrictions performing comparably. vaccine taken hold situation now. future always unknown data currently extremely positive. Bugchasers would like word you. 100% this. I‚Äôd say least 50% workplace Canada rather vocal getting vaccinated whole ""if young nothing worry about"" line selfish small-minded. young person carry disease, suffer symptoms, spend weeks spreading everyone encounter, there's guarantee either people spread going youthful fortitude. 

In pandemic, can't afford think solely ourselves. together. Whatever makes people happy. Similar me. I'm sitting watching cousins become rabid antivaxxers putting rest family well, parents, grandparents etc eligible none got I'd kill waiting least couple months... assume going needed every time need give jabs - like next year?? 70 million doses unaccounted for. That's lot. yet anti-vaxxers impunity. agree; insane. Yes, go away Summer weather gets warmer... guidance wearing glasses protect catching covid.

Double-masking supposed fit ill-fiting, good mask face using good-fitting bad mask. breath aerosols gaps, really work well. one able bend little wire mask, well. Exactly Argentina 80+ ppl doctors, dorks tricked getting vaccine. mind can‚Äôt understand inmune worst virus last 100 years.  Testing herd-immunity real lives. Anti-Vaxxers first realise... late.  Yep. experienced similar situation. genuinely curious see anti-vaxxers claim vaccine deadly poison say vast majority population vaccinated suffering ill effects. Like, many admit wrong this, even privately, many try find rationalization despite evidence we're secretly poisoned something.  Also, willed enough start, better get now, later would ones say need it. way vax people end. 

I like realizing working out. wonder people actually planned anticipated way, clueless decisions coming together photo lmao -	The CDC telling people stop wearing masks. telling vaccinated people conditions don‚Äôt wear them. It‚Äôs choice. 
-	Of course 100% guarantee safety. Neither 100% guarantee won‚Äôt get die cause. Oh wow Canada got doses way earlier thought. remember Canadian redditor (supposedly) saying country wouldn‚Äôt get supply September. Ohio sees selfish people real convictions climbing woodworks*** Interesting idea, hadn‚Äôt thought this.

Jake Tapper insufferable twitter, crying crocodile tears Canada ""deserves better"".. pointed still one top countries world, weird gap US Canada tragic, gap UK US... ""deserve better"" France etc lower us didn't?

Anyway, obvious along.. matter quickly roll doses 45% population take them.. what's going matter % willing take them. are. No, Merica. Don‚Äôt give hope. USA vaccination demand dropped sharply 40% total population got first dose. Let‚Äôs say that‚Äôs 50% Germany would 40 million people. We‚Äôre currently 32 million Germany increasing 700k every day. 10 days demand start dropping imo days open everyone mother get vaccinated. think point view probably considered, quickly discarded would 100% backfired. People would revolted, would anarchy. think hesitancy back early days close 50%, reason gone people seeing peers willingly go get shot, fear going jail. downplay long ‚Ä¶ last year number cases spiked shortly announcement postponing game 2021 , guess history repeating year  heard lot states haven‚Äôt really much mask participation least pockets? rates aren‚Äôt far states mask participation?

Don‚Äôt get wrong believe masks work believe advocacy also lower touted. much higher chance dying normal work day dying virus. I'd rather carry vaccine card everywhere mask! difference carrying ID. issue asthma/allergies. using disposable masks (and actually disposing reasonable amount wearing time), using cloth reused mask? Kids need allowed get vaccinated asap. normal times. vaccine safe. Waiting September (AFTER school starts) ridiculous. Even waiting another month ridiculous. wish parents would demand it. agree. post made sad. inequality real. Yes little . keep mind probably good month mask usage goes 20% decent amount still going it. it‚Äôs efficacy masks it‚Äôs going diminish even mention people wearing cloth ones already little one benefit good portion wearing without cloth masks even useless were. either way then, clearly think kill good guidance generally instance don't.

In uneducated people use critical thinking skills change minds change positions based new information, right?

Yes, thanks quick summary CDC works. hope mean yourself. exactly education makes opinion reliable entire CDC, people educations fields related virus pandemic? work retail last year Covid.

I‚Äôm sure contributes much danger feel like lot people overblown Covid lot people equally blown that‚Äôs even phrase. perfectly healthy people claim haven‚Äôt even outside last year blows mind. could kind understand certain ailments would make higher risk group. think little idea put things perspective. Similar guy said I‚Äôm fucking done without thinking children physically can‚Äôt get vaccine myleofibrosis. got moderna vaccine, worried COVID compared someone without mf? big difference already flu vaccines safe recommended children young 6 months old. Found anti-masker. Take pills. Wow! makes zero sense. Isn‚Äôt using waste? Like thought needed kept cold &amp; used ASAP? &amp; seems like people pretty much go get anywhere now. get it? might might reach vulnerable one day need RIGHT endanger people intentionally.

If pregnant, young etc., can't vaccinate. get PERMANENT? incessant need contrarian sake contrarian. reason it. Mainstream consensus suggests it, instinctively oppose it. 

That‚Äôs say isn‚Äôt personal societal benefit going grain every while. Take look miraculous research taking place psychedelics right now. people fringes society trying normalize use years years, never would creeped mainstream consciousness like currently is. case contrarians saw benefit (whether personal societal) kept rest society started see benefit too.

I've trusted CDC others spent countless hours becoming experts field. said wear mask, did. said get vaccinated, did. they're saying wear mask, (unless establishment requires to). difference people expected know stuff saying one thing public/nurses saying opposite. 

I‚Äôll trust experts going safe month-6weeks everything normal anyway? Yeah sooner people expected, acting though months sooner...no, like weeks sooner.  absolutely agree thing. I'm breathing people's junk anymore. got mine today Quebec! thought Canada behind... good hear CDC's evidence suggests currently authorized COVID-19 vaccines may provide protection variety strains, including B.1.1.7 (originally identified United Kingdom). antibody neutralization efficacy observed B.1.351 strain (originally identified South Africa).

This even make sense. learn novel means context think makes sound smart? Nothing completely stop point, that's I'm arguing for. 

But, studies show does, fact, reduce chance infection quite bit. showed following second dose vaccine (the recommended number doses), risk infection reduced 90 percent two weeks vaccination. still uncontrolled community spread many areas. new cases per day, new deaths per day, basically last fall big surge started October. opinion/argument wait lower spread vaccinations CDC releases guidance renders impossible businesses local governments impose restrictions see fit.  correct.  require it. nothing law it. wouldn‚Äôt worry vaccine resistant variant point.

But ""I LiSTEn SciEnCe"" meme always made cringe. Science without proper social context appropriate, benifical application useless.

One could easily look around disolving trust last four years engendered, hostile, literally *militant* reaction anti-vaxxers Covid Denialists - forget white supremacists tried kidnap Governor Michgan restrictions - say ""Even data says vaccinated safe removing masks indoors, given number unvaccinated people pressure anti-vaxxers, might safer keep mandates place.""

Science magical, apolitical monolith. remove science subjective circumstances political sphere in. And, assuming take CDC good faith trust 'strictly scientific' decision, foolish, dangerous decision.

'Objectivity' ultimately excuse 'out' people avoid grappling messy realities, leaves luxury comfort 'above all' peril. CDC Federal Government choosing wash hands this, leaving individuals mercy circumstances, makes distater messy, ununified COVID efforts even shattered. New Jersey would like word you. ._. Even best vaccines 100%. bound break cases. key rare.  Hopefully % US saying won‚Äôt get vaccinated decreases. I‚Äôd love see border opened summer. Vaccines likely protect Indian variant, Indian variant far transmissible UK variant. Thus become new dominant variant. could cause lot damage unvaccinated communities, vaccinated communities, since huge spike cases (especially vaccine uptake low restrictions dropped, meaning high circulation COVID) still mean lot double vaccinated people hospital. Still escape vaccines. story title says Kroger‚Äôs MI. Exactly. Maybe convince many, even percentage people doubting convinced, might actually hit herd immunity... didn‚Äôt get shot 5/15 (1 month CA opened everyone) even got J&amp;J still won‚Äôt considered fully vaxxed 5/29. got mRNA shot closer June 15th (as long get 2nd shot time). science say risks Covid small children? N95‚Äôs protect wearer. Get one you‚Äôre worried.  neanderthals I'm curious slow start vaccinations Canada worked favour? Making vaccine seem coveted back like Feb/March US, making peopl want get it. vaccine actually seem stop spreading it. CDC overly cautious studies complete, fact said vaccinated need mask, odds spread COVID-19 minimal.

Also, people, fault own, legitimately can't get vaccine.

Lastly, unless tested positive asymptomatic, COVID. know someone asymptomatic tested positive, know disease nastily sick week. fun, even avoid hospital stay. works vaccine, ppl recovered COVID? sorry hear immunocompromised. advice would get N95 masks. local Home Depot supply various types. scarce used be. unless hard Lockdown, never completely safe covid, never going another risk must consider. masking forever protect immune compromised.  Haha. Texan here. county, Dallas, good vaccinations. small towns hesitancy is. Sadly people dug there's whole lot change minds.  used get cold every years. Wearing mask time go public avoid one every years illness good trade opinion. I‚Äôd rather live life. Masks come people start behaving normally. covid anxiety persists group masking distancing. 

The vaccines work: time behave like it. Good Lmao know never said false info making joke people learn use social media sources adays  Administering first shots paused nationally doses currently secured reserved second shots.

Rolling first doses Pfizer resume May 22 AZ May 27. plan administer 13m people least first shot within 2Q. Let's see things go well planned.

Vaccines campaign arriving schedule. Broward county it‚Äôs masks times. People think DeSantis lawless state. so. haven‚Äôt noticed vaccinated people getting COVID.

How shit getting filtered misinformation? odds miniscule may well tell people wear helmet walking street case someone flings rock them.  work Target. still require unless fully vaxxed. we‚Äôre allowed ask you‚Äôre vaxxed. corporate overlords scared get sued LOL thanks  GOP Congressmen‚Äôs Kids Realistically, could stopped left China incubation period 14 days??  bad comparison. Kids get sick time. don‚Äôt long term illness merely breathing room. might get sick normal. came lab, escaped said lab proper precautions followed, yes would fault yes would preventable. stop advance notice, mean stopped leaving lab. force nature something helped create.  advantage behind 0 Covid approach?

Fewer new variants, theory could vaccine-resistant (although far case, perhaps academic). time employers start making vaccination mandatory employees enter workplace order ensure safe environment employees. proof vaccination, admittance (with rare exceptions course determined OSHA guidance). Exactly good psychological method explain correlation two, another reason vaccinated.  People would regular lottery ticket. think realize degenerate average American is. There's 5 drawings milly That's interesting. follow logic.

In practice, level immunity (even 10%) begins break chain transmission. course, linear. 10% immunity confers little herd immunity 50% confers lot 5 times that. Herd immunity really kicks get past 50% population rises sharply thereafter. flu vaccine 50% efficacy good job depressing transmission. appreciate SARS-Cov2 infectious flu countries like UK immunity rate 50%. Thanks! Also Google ""covid vaccine overdose"" saw articles. Good see seems harmless happens Really? live US mask mandates taken quite seriously government havn't seen tantrums every time go bigger store god forbid mall see many peopke refusing wear mask properly. teenager offered mask said would pull tshirt he, course, couple minutes. middle-aged woman blatently wearing mask elbow pad (we really medical exemptions here, kids pregnant people allowed wear cloth masks instead n95 ones, toddlers fully exempt). muslim girl loosely holding mask front veiled face (remember n95 mandate, think work inch face). older man folded mask basically looked like umbrella nose (on first glance looked normal though since actually extended past lips, flush face). 

I'm really surprised havn't experienced anythink like that. would thought idiots existed everywhere.  Stuff like would probably work country lol  (a bit loop here)?  exactly type censorship want see fit narrative? two different cases, seems survived. Google ‚Äúaccidental multiple vaccine doses injected‚Äù sth like you‚Äôll probably find since probably happened twice Rollout speed absolutely matters un-vaccinated first shed masks yet last ones so. proof j&amp;j single shot way effective single shot others? me, seems simple marketing trial cost saving move, three targeted efficacy longer lasting immunity, could stopped first shot similar results. you‚Äôre getting vaccine then? Wow...my Kroger one places didn‚Äôt much encourage mask use start. China basically prevented look case counts.. Airline Pilot brought asked Government could give reduced quarantine period 10 days instead 14. agreed.

The Pilot visited several places (including brothel similar), tested positive 10 day quarantine, late.

It really simple. That's still wear mask anywhere Brisbane, Australia. going surprise cr@p everybody turn - long way everybody (including Government, Airports, etc.) lax it. Yeah know people think faked en masse anything? Similar experience Tennessee. Still waiting 1st doses outside Toronto. permanent resident can‚Äôt get though.

That really sucks. Germany, need actual address good go (i.e. residents get vaccinated). fair, social distancing likely huge effect getting sick.  probably going get flu going grocery store without mask.  Keep mind, likely get COVID grocery store, COVID many times infectious flu. likely get cold flu child (daycare), extended contact work, social gatherings.  People get sick year worked home, go social gatherings, many send children school daycare. last year‚Äôs shitshow hasn‚Äôt already? beginning said average joe need mask? science support that. made call worried supply.

Yes, worried supply, considering pretty damn important medical professionals steady access masks, disagree? also immediately aware likely asymptomatic transmission was. evidence accumulated, recommendations changed. seems completely reasonable me. science today might support recommendations beginning, science evolves learn more. 

Yes, there's public policy top science, again, like idea medical professionals taking care COVID patients access masks, we're fucked. working COVID unit year. Well, except couple weeks sick, COVID, probably part proper mask states supply ran get us more.

Like said, I'm sure CDC fully aware flaws ""honor system,"" despite that, felt comfortable enough make recommendation. people criticized conservatives refuse accept recommendations experts whole time, refusing agree CDC hypocrites eyes. want continue wearing mask enjoy strangers seeing face, find helps allergies, whatever reason might have, great, keep wearing it. I'm going continue listening experts, follow recommendations, moment longer need wear mask situations. Seriously, like what, 10 peoples? link that?

Personally vaccine side effects pretty similar milder compared discomfort covid, although fortunately mild.

There anecdotal chatter covid vaccine stronger reactions first vaccine dose milder reactions second. surprised boosters needed side-effects common future doses. Makes sense, rate vaccination correlation case counts.

There many reasons affecting rate vaccination, including supply vaccines, needles, refrigerators, clinical trials, regulatory approvals, hesitancy population, etc... want population vaccinate future variants, regardless current case count.

You many nations near flat/negligible vaccination rates rising case count, like Taiwan Japan, high vaccination rates relatively high case counts liked United States. Make sure thing every single contagious disease. Make people carry around flu passport, herpes passport, AIDS passport, ECT. won‚Äôt spread it‚Äôs creating environment opens door unvaccinated people spreading them

But again, vaccinated people's responsibility make sure unvaccinated people follow rules. fault responsibility bunch shitty people want shitty. Vaccinated people jobs getting vaccine following COVID guidelines last year, job role models shitty people likely follow lead anyway.

It's akin punishing entire classroom 3 trouble makers follow rules class. exactly gold standard? 7 provinces better Taiwan. feel bad too. understand worry children - two young ones myself. know understand enough one, they're significant risk two, adults they're around already vaccinated, they're going infect anyone else.

That's posts doing. kind posts blaming vaccinated people want wear masks children/immunocompromised people getting sick.

Vaccinated people carry approximately zero risk spreading COVID-19, I've seen ton posts say ""you wearing mask going lead thousands kids dying"". No, unvaccinated people wearing masks lead that. Everyone gotten vaccinated done job responsibility that.

The problem arguments making strawman arguments try say ""if want take mask, fault kids get sick"". Eye protection. already wear glasses, wear safety goggles glasses.

An HR accommodation could safer place eat lunch take breaks--such access outdoor space private space. messaged PCP doctor order due recommended reason. going ask GI doctor perhaps. talking vaccinations. Masking entirely separate issue. ""You either die hero, live long enough see become villain.""

But then, blaming ""Asian countries"" slow vaccinations military made decision. Tone entitlement racism, makes sound ridiculously butthurt.

Since numbers husband fully vaccinated, thought time venture out. gone Target twice. would nice safer time option.  Based you‚Äôre saying sounds like ability assess risk poor cause potential sadness  think children get approved. Well said. definitely think interesting unique place, better &amp; worse. pretty spot hurt feelings unfortunately. recall back 80s Chrissy Hynde &amp; Pretenders (also Ohio &amp; Cleveland area; people &amp; /u/nideak) pretty big hit concerned city grew in. overly complimentary full ""you suck"" either. many people arms implied dis missed core message. may complicated feelings something someone care about.

Yeah, maybe places like that; Ohio affected crash steel industry different Pennsylvania &amp; others 70s &amp; 80s (although Penn pretty close). Tailored solutions like IMO way go regardless think DeWine politics - irrelevant - he's getting family, friends others poked, good him. can? long process that. Also, making distribution... anyways.... get ready round 4 due people ""fed virus"". LoL  go talk government that. right go ones masked up, follow guidelines got vaccine. 

i'm changing stance situation. mean...that‚Äôs happens completely disparaging gap wage, living, etc. rich created army people care one else does. genius literally revolves around that. Hell I‚Äôd go get another shot entered.

$1 Million end person/family‚Äôs struggles. I'm really confused ""rolling red carpet"" means say ""staying home two years"" problem.

Because want keep safe, need distance. Staying home keeps safe. That's pre vaccination world post vaccination world. children yet, speaking behalf lot parents know anxious. many option self-isolate offices opening back even worse, offices requiring masks. area offices require masks desks anyone (vaccinated not)... even half wall cubicle environment air clearly moving throughout room CDC already told us indoor distancing work well.

As right they're predicting September child vaccine availability, 1-2 months school starts live. hope come sooner. Come down, Canadians! mRNA All! hope prepared take care employees may adverse reactions vaccine. OSHA recently said employer would liable mandate vaccines. million dollar motivation localized. got it.


Just like terrible drivers ""insert location whoever making comment"" Masks primarily protect people, wearer. know year pandemic? unvaccinated person going unmasked putting unvaccinated people risk, that's unacceptable. deal trivial nuisance wearing mask. Thanks correction! also downvoted, wrote telling another person feelings, actual risk involved. so, add conversation. exact thing happen last night. got 2nd moderna yesterday went bed feeling fine. woke freezing middle realistic fever dream. silly throw away thinking abilities..won't really waste time really people like you. happened 70%? Oh yea economy money. Funny people like sudden want trust science masks time. Cdc also says 70% population needs vaccine open up, masks off. Get ready mutants!! 

Unfortunately, masks made political Republicans prove can't Americans, thank that!

Check. Your. Self. Exactly say CDC rushed still need wearing masks protect people like continue masking while. realize since 2 days ago care less wear mask not? Seriously makes difference fully vaccinated Pfizer miracle get give it

deal you. 

no difference . none whatsoever  extrapolate thoughts burden public, outlaw alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana, etc. Again, that's slippery slope can't go there. Liberty dies grand feature small nibble there. Much like frog slowly turn heat pan realize cooked. Why? Weekend numbers not, reported 0 deaths weekend months. Nice try. tolerance magic sky daddies either.

We'd like see relatives summer neighbors see playground young babies families. felt safe enough socialize outdoors masks come off, find new ways navigate risks. probably mean isolation sad. big problem much hazard people creating others genuinely can't get vaccine underlying conditions. 
 
people *can* vaccinated, safely, *should* vaccinated. It‚Äôs 20-25% range surveys. much, also insignificant right speed effect vaccine rollout.   simply meaning pedantic refuting main point, going disaster people predicting. thought would, wrong. Happily. ""This confusing! understand policy. Culturally makes sense!"" --people subreddit, probably. should‚Äôve done June 12-15 get second dose. People unvaccinated, according cdc, shouldn‚Äôt go unmasked risk catching Covid...what people care risk? It‚Äôs businesses even governments job job decide whether someone okay risk getting virus. 

We reaching point basically people want vaccine opportunity get it‚Äôs decision. Still averaging 600/deaths day. Since early April it‚Äôs hovering around 6-700 day rapid decline.

I suspect decline continue slow re-opening continues people ditch precautions vaccinations slow.  I'm delusional health anxiety? even read comment judgemental abusive asshole? No, quite dip. think summer fine too, half expect vax crowd get decently smacked come winter even masks hard time containing it.

Hopefully enough people get shit together get vaccinated summer happen, holding breath. I‚Äôm fully vaccinated yes definitely üòê Rednecks love lottery. vaccines exceptionally effective even imagined. Seems like year ago hoping vaccines 50-60% effective Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J, AZ blew numbers left dust.   fundamentally right. lost sister growing watched parents. probably way overprotective, refuse live again. know can't protect forever, little helpless wife me. _The common clay new west._   take minute.

The two lines graph different groups trial. upper line placebo group. get vaccine trial. line stays flat group people got vaccine. lines first 10-12 days. that, really different, people got vaccine stopped getting sick, people kept getting sick. mutant level 9000!  opinion, think going back (mostly) normal \~1 month reasonable. say mostly still think would reasonable require mask locations risk would especially high, likely run someone immunocompromised (i.e. hospital), people cannot vaccinated (i.e. daycare children &lt;12 years old), crowded locations easily allow disease spread (i.e. airport). But, vast majority day-to-day interactions people meaningful chance fully immunized think fair say problem\*.

&amp;#x200B;

\*as long see warning signs getting sick burden healthcare facilities every state feel like whole country would vaccinated Friday using non-exact method tracking deaths certainly delayed undercounting. However use exact flawed method different days see downward trend, numbers aren‚Äôt exact deaths safely say deaths going down. using flawed method gives zero deaths first time long time, newsworthy. I've hammering brother head 2 weeks now. He's starting show cracks. I'm sending Dad soon. hated smoking laws (I even smoke like smoking complain time) believe infringes personal rights.

Smoking laws meaning inside restaurants whatnot? rights end affect others. Smoking cause cancer non-smokers nearby. increased chances cancer (or injury lack seatbelt helmet) also burden public services, also affecting others.

I understand thoughts this, looking wrong way. affecting others potentially spreading virus unvaccinated potentially increased burden public services. also new concept.  Parts OC great. Little Saigon, example. 90% got second shot around people, almost fully vaccinated. addition, precautions took would given considerable protection even without vaccination. That‚Äôs reassurance need. rest anxiety.

When intrusive thoughts hit Covid-19 apartment viewing, relabel OCD focus something else. sure fed govt didnt lift mandates

Did say Federal goverment lift mandates? say that? know government talking about? can't speak places. Well, speak live yes indeed, differences. There's lot good &amp; bad wherever go, flavor &amp; specifics tend local. Mad isn‚Äôt it? They‚Äôre spreading misinformation vaccine, expressing choice get one. medical procedures matter personal choice is? People lot less different places would believe. Selfishness greed core human traits you‚Äôll find everywhere.  idea trying say, what's bullshit overall numbers higher, zero Sunday bullshit since lot cities report Sundays? Either way, case numbers deaths going trending Plenty states done that.

Didn't really seem meaningful impacts vaccination rates. 99% hospitalized unvaccinated. they're ""rising much they're falling"" means they're flat, exactly said. Also, there's ""huge spike"" March. know fully vaccinated care idiots. Seriously idiots make difference fully vaccinated (like me). get sick I'd feel bad you. said personally care fully vaccinated Pfizer miracle Objective pessimistic thing.  morning, Austin officially adopted CDC guidance, ending mask mandate vaccinated. feeling chills. sounds normal. pass. hajib, service.

still think forced facial coverings ethical?  Summer basically here.

If concerned children, self isolate. That's going protect better masks people.

Deaths due COVID children less due car accidents disrupt lives deaths.

When school year starts back up, maybe different discussion vaccines still unavilable, anticipate much better place much lower case numbers higher vaccination rates. saying wrong :) guess I'm bad reading graphs :P found understand it. thank clarifying Yes, sorry, talking WV. Ohio's lottery sweet! Doubt they'll anything California beyond free snacks get private businesses.

That said, donated blood free hat. grocery store already dead first hour. Yeah that‚Äôs thought read seems day 7 increase antibodies still minimal possibility vaccination rates still low people get reckless. live serve. putting mask cause health problem others. keep wearing mask precaution won‚Äôt cause anyone heath problem. policy takes time write

They've done excellent job getting shots older folks, numbers show happens do:

1.9k cases 2 days ago, 4 deaths

1.9k cases yesterday, 5 deaths Better one dose two doses

I would expect alot timelines shift moved since tons vaccines coming stepdad GB got vaccinated doctors urging. CDC website recommends it‚Äôs frustrating people‚Äôs doctors give conflicting answers Okay then, get vaccinated people's lives depend it. 15% entire population still lot people, 45 million. IMO sounds right number people refuse vaccine dependents matter what, let's forget anti-vax attitudes still fringe society thankfully. decline indeath rate dropped much slower expected started vaccinating elderly Jan-Feb. said, decline really started accelerating May. 7 day average dropped 707 5/4 545 today. Since we're also seeing significant decline cases see much reason expect keep declining 3-400 per day June. another covid pandemic, *any* pandemic. Mom vaccinated North Bay almost two months ago pickup orders kids go inside.

Seems like already got solution! I'm suggesting easing distancing/masking, still happen special hours essential businesses.

I'm happy enough smile wrong vaccine rollout working.  Remember, even vaccine end year ""fact checked"" media declared lie.  mind fucking business concerning I‚Äôm wearing mask ü§† feel like I'm going crazy way people's thinking flipped. I'm tribal bullshit Wellllll masks don‚Äôt work thing really early pandemic pretty much knew jack shit virus. Thanks wasn‚Äôt aware this. gave everyone something like $500-$1,000 get it, everyone would getting it. Hell, I'd even get two three times. LOL Wawa mask policy? lingering sleepiness, 3-4 days. think it‚Äôs long enough might want consult doctor, sure there‚Äôs something else going on. know feeling first clue thyroid hormone dose needs adjusting. may seem unbelievable, I‚Äôve multiple stints acute anxiety manifest seemingly inexplicable physical symptoms, yes including rash, among things. you‚Äôre heightened state anxiety, it‚Äôs easy trap brain feedback loop fuel even physical emotional symptoms. called they‚Äôll basically repeat what‚Äôs website bought tickets baseball game. I'm planning 4th July BBQ concert August. LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Wawa iced tea tastes like freedom  Exactly, people protesting change really mean want vaccine passports. different discussion. They'd also start seeing boost shots gave everyone $500 getting fully vaccinated. seriously say would hit *85%?!*

They need factor social science models. least they‚Äôd accounting antivaxxer. 'Texas lifting mask mandate' surge practically reported impending apocalypse. never said covid deaths. end day reporting deaths per category totally inaccurate based admission labeling deaths ways never that's all. Even though think COVID serious people, vaccine passports way go. That's beign conspiracy theorist, that's someone values freedom fear-mongering virus that's mostly risk elderly obese. Depends TX. people wore masks corporate owned stores posted mask required signs. lots rural areas locally owned businesses never required masks people wore businesses point pandemic. Kids hardly ever wore part TX. city, suburbs, small towns. hardly ever worn outdoors anybody crowd situations. Restaurants mostly normal capacity people wear masks them. Every time got curbside pickup watched steady streams unmasked customers going buildings. Employees masks, customers didn't. windows see through, nobody sitting tables masks. restaurants mainly mask free zones. small towns churches held in-person mask optional services events like bazaars holiday performances. parades, town fairs, holiday attractions like walk light displays. Large festivals fundraising concerts. Outdoors safer, plenty mask optional events people close proximity happened regular basis. past winter indoor performances restaurants, coffee shops, bars happened. state mandates may lifted March, many counties never enforced them. gave corporate owned stores chance start phasing masks required masks recommended signs. understand logic all. defying personal logic masking doesn‚Äôt seem matter right (in terms overall populations/numbers).

It's exhausting. People fight much get mandates can't even accept mask effectiveness negligible.

Texas lifts mandate everyone says ""you'll sorry"" sorry say ""Oh well businesses kept mandates"" refuse even entertain idea masks pretty ineffective covid.

The person replying claims 99% adoption yet doubt point wondered beat covid pre-vaccine high compliance.

In 3-6 weeks people willing admit wrong cases continue plummet. It'll either silence ""people kept wearing masks that's cases explode""

I'll gladly admit wrong sky really fall seeing vaccines actually pandemic pretty obvious masks barely anything.

Disengunity popular Reddit, seems. ""We can't afford it!""

-People want give billions aid Israel Saudis. personally happen yes would expect someone CDC contact see anything accuracy, low cost fast article claims, sound like great technology. know normally would reply comment like this, others may reading say: serious checking ""specific weather information,"" -- might want leave snarky comment out. So, ernest interested, would happy share (but right self-respect boundaries). send kindness know differing kinds negativities time. try kinder feels better something thank reminding well. Namaste. CDC told phone get vaccine Guillian-Barre avoid tetanus flu shots talk doctor. doctor calls back says wouldn‚Äôt get lmao I‚Äôm confused time government got something right related... offices opening back means kids MUST go back school/daycare unless people afford otherwise.

The concern we've already seen 1 variant seemed target spread worse among children, would surprise see more. know COVID spreading rapidly high population density countries right now. 

So me, keeping masks required essential locations kids vaccinated would happy medium. think adults vaccinated deserve get closer ""normal"" life again, especially terms socializing/social locations risk averse easily avoid. also started going back gym, mask working out, two weeks post-Pfizer, early March me. tested part post-vaccine tracking study. Negative. Looks like it‚Äôs working. lot posters handling stage pandemic well.  Reality starting set may last forever they're upset that. They're best ignored, unless need cheap entertainment. lot doctors practices actually already start dropping priority lists uncertainty AstraZeneca vaccine. Many people priority list want instead throwing vaccines, they've opened basically anyone wants, often first come first serve basis. Phew, here! registered. I‚Äôm physician understand rigour pharmaceutical industry. Quite frankly, far far long pipeline figure basic *critical* practicality medication/vaccine/product. 

We phase 4 medications, final phase clinical trials. products accelerated development last year, studied many years extent, clear onset prompt development, distribution, storage, administration vaccines paramount overcoming worldwide pandemic. 

I made original comment provide skepticism clear disappointed execution entire vaccine rollout. It‚Äôs things like add cumulatively cause massive harm inability save lives. assumed original comment would automatically downvoted oblivion redditors unable properly critically appraise processes currently place. Lol literally said fed didnt lift mandates. never federal mandates would stood them. pretty close opinions month apart time-line. think that's meant 50% 35s. think meant opening next age group earlier % previous group getting shot  Maybe working, maybe is...but mayor provides zero elaboration, much less evidence, such. merely seems like think work.

He lifted mask mandate spite puts ""check vaccine records"" responsibility workers they've dealt enough bullshit fucking assholes already.  people power gain power tend want keep it. Considering strict UK lockdowns I'm surprised they're trying fear-monger keep measures place there's reason doom-mongering. There‚Äôs thing best greatest number people. build stairs houses despite fact people legs exist, end day society cater extreme minorities time. know sucks, life isn‚Äôt fair keeping everyone locked small minority population fair everyone else Thank participating. get vaccinated worked job hour commute way 2 years.

It truly sucks life you.

Have wake 6 get 8. Get home 6 7. 

That gives you, what, 4 5 hours day ‚Äúyou‚Äù time? mention gas/transportation costs. 

I‚Äôll NEVER accept job crazy commute like that. 

It‚Äôs worth it, enough companies realizing that, don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll to.

Plus, would companies want limit labor pool exists within hour office? Open hiring broader pool. wearing mask public going eat example, risks still low. want go Montreal. come back?  use rounded numbers age demographics fact-check, someone else fact-checks back: *congratulations, you* *~~played~~* fact-checked *yourself.* love representation data here, pleasing look at.

Personally hard time believing ever reach 85%, 70% good milestone towards herd immunity  know many people gotten vaccinated people like you.

Vaccine trial participant here, one main motivations still is. also get angry people try downplay well COVID vaccines reduce transmission. Kids immunocompromised need protection; even waited 70% adult population vaccinated drop mask mandates, problems kids immunocompromised still there, helps them? high vaccination rates vaccines major effect stopping spread! much likely scenario even ‚Äúlab leak‚Äù theory somebody got oopsy infected actual bat specimen. I‚Äôd trouble believing that. asking excess deaths came from. opinion. coincidence 500k+ excess deaths last year?  Public universities IDK, went private schools recall requiring vaccinations. comments posts FULL people medical reason can't take vaccine/it's effective answer. immunocompromised everything happened.

I get convenient/feels safer everyone around wearing masks, got ending. can't expect accommodated way anymore, like covid.

To downvoting posts, sorry like description reality happening right now, regardless read/vote on. REACH HERD IMMUNITY vaccination many antivax idiots. Let get immunity old fashioned way quickly possible safer too. Lmao!!  Fair! live Texas can't say what's going there. imagine there's big difference cities rural, like state.

For now, I'm changing behavior much fine me. Like said, numbers tell us story soon! Fellow UC sufferer remicade azathioprine. fear you‚Äôre fully vaccinated. fortunate patient one best universities country treating researching UC Chrons doctors assured risk low others. significant data UC/Chrons patients worse outcomes getting covid getting infected post-vaccination. almost died flare three years ago, know serious UC be.

I highly recommend talking doctor getting assurance here. get fear comes immunosuppressed fear may warranted vaccinated.  Wow, almost like vaccines work something! Cautiously optimistic here. Yes, fully agree vaccines work.

However, studies seem conducted participants healthcare (or similar) setting. pretty sure masked study. fact, latest CDC recommendation requires everyone masked healthcare setting even fully vaccinated people. 

I trying find study shows transmission spread significantly reduce fully vaccinated people *without masks*. like it? Go different store. Vote wallet. forget country in? kept elementary kids online year. way school district conduct classes far removed developmentally appropriate young kids felt would detrimental send spend year learning online. pedantic. Got it. AZ recommend 40s UK. safe side.   Anchor: ""So zero covid deaths states?""

Reporter: ""No....we reporting that"" im 30s dates/hookups women 18s 45+s, ageist. Tell exact reason hell weird 30 year old 23 year old. reasonable logical one, ageist ""its creepy"" excuse. Exactly people don‚Äôt wear properly handle properly.  strict protocol taking masks using sanitizer masses don‚Äôt follow. I've completing v-safe questionnaires post-vaccine. last questionnaire, survey asked got positive pregnancy test since vaccine, responded yes - found I'm pregnant 2 weeks 2nd dose Moderna. survey asked I'd open representative CDC contacting information, said yes. 

Out curiosity, anyone else got message, anyone actually reached you? kind information looking for? also register drawing chances probably better everyone register.  Excuse you?  Pro-science means following cdc guidance says unvaccinated need masked. propose enforce that, since care much science?  offers better training?

""I fear man practiced 10,000 kicks once, fear man practiced one kick 10,000 times."" What? Link? good news Democrat leaning cities, looks like residents naturally going take gradual approach fully taking masks, even vaccinated. 148 Million doses (April 27) I'll first vaccine shot tomorrow, take pain killers (like paracetamol) beforehand? It‚Äôs time move pandemic USA ..and states honestly  Depends go guess. people I‚Äôve spoken aren‚Äôt wearing masks vaccinated. 

A lot people masks actually yelling vaccinated people. It‚Äôs strange.

Edit: Tampa People gotten covid still know long antibodies effective.

Yes, people millions probably billions infected this.

It's shitty argument ""people get vaccinated still get it.""

Both cases incredibly rare statistically, there's lot misinformation unfortunately redditors susceptible crazy uncle Facebook. Hey! I‚Äôm one them! Shhh. Parents get angry hear perfectly safe, vaccinated, good time. Yeah, get that. I‚Äôm 15 one friends said would get it, parents hesitant.

Luckily parents hesitant anti-vaxx, persuasion still happen. He'd thoughts regardless.

Natural immunity, though, good vaccines. imagine double tap better either one itself. ""cure"" diabetes. im looking forward to. Even needs boosters. archaic caste system anything inequities Indians facing? Well hope get 0 deaths! US keep border closed while. America handled poorly, none us right boast ""stopping pandemic"" CDC said advice individual. It‚Äôs like scientifically factual statement take account human behavior. said mandates businesses local leaders. 

Most importantly still saying unvaccinated need mask. follow logical conclusion means businesses need require masks everyone order ensure unvaccinated wear masks. Otherwise failing meeting recommendation. We've 0 death days before, usually followed high numbers following day. yes, I'm glad things trending right direction, hope continues. Theyre better adults. Compliance st schools nearly 100%. They're happy back.

No whining freedoms. 5 year old preschool classmates wear fine Every country share ignorant intolerant people. they'd join together island make miserable. Sort portmanteau friend mine Texas. discussing relative merits OH vs TX, covered rocket science &amp; medical stuff. heard first oddly relevant conversation - talking number astronauts OH, Cleveland Clinic &amp; relative similars. also r/Coronavirus post i've seen since joined subreddit like 3 weeks ago.  Personally would warn first report her. way stop situation even starts sure whether intubation enteral ventilation would uncomfortable...if I'd focus staying alive.  used envious you. I'm expert, would seem efficient move vaccines across border injection sites Canada, rather Canadians travel across border injection sites USA travel back Canada. lot changed since March problem cautious time. I'd rather err side caution come back later say ""oops underestimated virus"". we're different place virus since many vaccinated. always ever revolving situation. interpretation 100% confirmed various clarifying interviews Fauci Wollensky.

I also think imply indeed higher risk children immune compromised individuals, higher risk acceptable one.

Obviously CDC would never actually say that, appears stance.

I personally see logic agree also 100% sympathize people care someone group higher (albeit still probably small) risk. people don‚Äôt want wear mask individual level isn‚Äôt big deal.

But macro level, lifting mask mandates huge positive effect economy. means jobs, healthier lifestyle, better mental health lot benefits outweigh negatives.

But again!!! know must suck ass group that‚Äôs eating negative! Seems disagree weather ok individual asked suffer temporarily benefit many.

I say goes countries topic, completely bonkers restrict movement epidemic. worst symptoms, positive test would almost relief since build antibodies.

I'm sure understand this.

If fever, already started make antibodies. fever over, worst it. Ahh yes, Nurses, ones denying get vaccinated large amounts, yea, listen CDC, Fauci, actual doctors, degrees Epidemiology, nurses wont even get vaccinated.  Look pharmaceutical companies countries like Canada didn‚Äôt proactively secure vaccine orders like Trump did.

Every expert told us would years, ever, got vaccinations. Operation warp speed well leaving states administer federal stockpile vaccines lead nation vaccinating 1M people day week office.

Keep thanking fauci though, even though can‚Äôt articulate one thing except play politics give us contradicting, dangerous, meaningless commands. commentary post-vaccination activities definitely lead decreased vaccination adoption well. clear countries strictest mask mandates fare better others. marginal effect best. vaccines. 1.) people won‚Äôt always get vaccinated. We‚Äôve seen before.

2.) I‚Äôve yet see people wear masks flu seasons real life, they're getting vaccinated rates, despite say online I've worn painter's mask full filters worst ragweed season before. like, ""Fuck it, way I'm getting day massive air filter front face."" Taking tab Claritin tab Zyrtec morning nothing.

It helped. Looked like weirdo, said, ""ragweed got me"", understood. truly people deep whole thing think giving anxiety things actually improving.. can't say why, obvious postings.. trust anything positive paid taxes pandemic give back asshole get vaccine... world literally talking ass god righties dumb. saying went away warm weather pushes people outside rate infection incredibly low. Take account actual substantial dip cases last summer statement absurd think is. You‚Äôre really peeling onion now. didn‚Äôt notice, nothing really makes sense more. Get vaccine don‚Äôt get sick perpetuate pandemic? Nah. Chance winning lottery, fuck yah. Like wtf.

The brilliant thing lottery approach it‚Äôs fighting fire fire.

Generally speaking, it‚Äôs hard imagine highly connected world (where extremism amplified) resulted motivations driven social pressures rather critical thinking.   **HOW/WHERE COVID VAX CARD FRAUD REPORTED?** 

My aunt entitled (and unfortunately) wealthy, idiot. itching resume international travel found someone sell forged COVID Vaccination card. fake one, legit documents forged say vaccinated. (Allegedly, source medical professional.) 
 
Is venue report submit tip? people really can‚Äôt detect sarcasm they? think way look remember much world (Western especially), reality pandemic rather new. often, pre-covid, average American Canadian think getting sick? Take temperature? Probably nowhere near much 2020. often getting new studies updates flu (presuming they're healthcare)? lot things way dangerous Covid children daily news update them. main focus WORLD year that's big. Covid brought reality people's doors rubbed noses it. average suburbanite used told there's invisible risk lives floating about. 1% positivity rate falling. 

We‚Äôve found California power masses, following CDC guidance science. Exactly. yes well, EU send many? placebo hell drug Dude, never said masks 100% effective. hard admit misunderstood point. Still doubling tripling think said. First claimed said masks better vaccines, claimed masks 100% effective. None true!

Also, *you* asked data wanted show me. provide decided ignore request.

I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. problem! Hope enjoy life again. Really terrible. top priority world governments help poor areas basic needed goods services. think CDC's viewpoint unvaccinated children low risk hospitalized. Sure hear severe inflammatory cases, they're even rare childhood cancers. Children apt catch covid going back school, mixing &amp; socializing unvaccinated kids. like children markets &amp; retailers coughed hugged random strangers. test negative rapid test, *much less likely* spread virus. thing know sure many people got covid get it? People gotten covid still know long antibodies effective. I'm concerned risking lives I'm fully vaccinated, understand worries people.  Why? Thanks! Really appreciate guidance. I‚Äôm sorry. That‚Äôs ridiculous. Vaccinated people go quarantine. early results UK study. Found 3 fold increase mild moderate side effects. Yeah it‚Äôs pretty wild, I‚Äôm comfortable since I‚Äôm vaccinated like, pretty intense assuming get work first two hours. I'd wager working jobs give paid time go shopping.

This issue retired people. there's immunocompromised people who, even though get vaccine, effectiveness likely much less thus leave vulnerable unmasked person carrying it, guess they're also supposed forfeit stake society. Right, I‚Äôm sure CDC taken risk account.

The people don‚Äôt care virus unmasking. Target Walmart already dropping mask requirements. vaccinated person continuing mask doesn‚Äôt change anything. Dude that's incredible. got Regen mild moderate cases. still impression ventilator severe case! 
Why hell ppl downvoting this? expecting rise number cases, continuing decline hospitalization death rates. Even one shot, you‚Äôre still much lower risk severe disease death. 

The way see it, people highest risk COVID fully vaccinated months now. Middle aged people young adults, medium risk severe disease death, one shot point within next two weeks. Children eligible vaccine always naturally low risk severe disease death. basically, US whole flattened level risk COVID. means even COVID continues spread via children antivaxxers lie take masks, infected shouldn‚Äôt going hospital, shouldn‚Äôt dying. They‚Äôll mild cases, stay home days.  getting stats? I've relying Bloomberg, puts Georgia 37 percent range first doses, may include overall population expanded include 12+? I'm sure methodology first time long time states 0 even monday. rolling avg going everywhere too. Yeah, sorry, get idea. Honestly think investing medical science best long-term course action literally advocating locking people masking/vaccinating. can't even this. No, that‚Äôs actual mortality rate across infected people. No, mods listen CDC says transmission vaccination rare, masking longer necessary vaccinated individuals. 

As variants, contagious ones issue unvaccinated world, far haven‚Äôt found evidence render vaccines ineffective, it‚Äôs people aligned reality, downplaying things. Absolutely. love idea. really could care less wearing masks transportation commerce. doesn‚Äôt bother all. Masks inhibit social outings though. don‚Äôt wanna go concert sporting event mask. I‚Äôd rather stay home. Oh tables turned, remember Canadians keying american cars Canada.  Oh big critic CDC Trump Biden. don‚Äôt think health-based decision. However, know decision open floodgates unvaxxed people unmask, too. risk probably taken account. remember reading lot ""articles"" sub saying vaccine may ready another 2 years (in 2020) may able go outside another several years. Lots saying would never see outside again.

I definitely would say, despite benefits corporations got pandemic, worked hard day night get vaccine running effectively. Medical/Science come long way I'm hoping we'll prepared future. don‚Äôt see not. issue PPE distribution wasn‚Äôt corruption, lack supply.

God bless America waiting September approval though? need data 12-16 year olds?

I've heard reason we're delaying approval unknown long term efficiency. seems Pfizer's vaccine 80-90% efficiency, seem already data people who've vaccine 6-12 months already. drivers Ed told us case two cheerleaders bucked front seat car linebacker boyfriends unbuckled back seat. Guess happened crash: linebackers crushed cheerleaders death. Letting people pick choose rules feel like following affect around them. It‚Äôs infuriating. still wear mask several reasons:
1. vaccine 95% effective, take chance?
2. work public people feel safer seeing us masks on.
3. actually kinda like wearing mask I'm used it. great us interact customers; frown, smirk, stick tongue out, etc. without freaking Karens. often, nice option. Can't believe saw people around say would Cinco de Mayo surge anyone outside college bros border states gives shit it.  Yeah people follow that. think I‚Äôll get months. wonder circle said got vaccine, didn‚Äôt... need lot hand holding get 90% population vaccinated. 20% country needs government assistance, homeless mentally ill every bridge.

Reading examples, saw case study two friends (allegedly) met outdoors without masks lengthy conversation close proximity. me, situational awareness key - long close proximity conversation exposure two people walking street opposite directions pass briefly. sporting event get close personal player another team significant periods, breathing heavily - would greater exposure risk hanging park social distancing.

Don't misquote me. 

The reason Danish government chose stop using specific vaccine Denmark low amount cases would statistically kill people use vaccine.

60% hit 18+!!! Send 'em India. seem wanting them, there. like lottery approach. much easier say ""you could win million bucks!"" people read listen science. article also dispute claim evidence supports vaccinated individuals greatly reduced risk spreading covid. also really think nurses experts topic especially considering large number nurses getting vaccinated. know sources bring (I saw prior edit), none dispute said risk transmission.  visited South Carolina mask mandate stores enforced stores can't even handle national one. obvious people never learn. People many places lack discipline awareness properly respond actual pandemic, let alone future one happened yet.  point lockdowns, mask requirements mandates prevent hospitals getting overwhelmed. risk overwhelmed decision? yes, CDC revoke policy. no, CDC made right decision.

If going call CDC making bad call, better come something stronger ""people lie mutations may happen!"". Actually bring facts data suggests CDC wrong. CDC making decisions 100% science fact based, opinion emotionally based. policy cause problems, show work show CDC cause problems. I'm confident CDC work making statement. don‚Äôt even check temps anymore. Think it‚Äôs 70% masks 30% masks. 36 percent Americans vaccinated. Idiots let individual locations agencies manage needed. sites medically vulnerable populations. really declare ""Mission Accomplished"" early rest world still ravaged Coronavirus. started Thursday, even full week data yet. definitely going lot week. official announcement link order  Antisemitism isn‚Äôt clever visits specialists worth calling them. Cardiologist, OB GYNO etc. going admit didn‚Äôt get vaccine now? get bad case covid look like massive fool admitting didn‚Äôt get vaccinated. There‚Äôs huge incentive lie one expecting people thread saying shame people wear one, wtf? sounds like guys shaming here, reason. mind fucking business face? order takes effect school already though, point given easy get vaccine I‚Äôm thinking natural selection start weed don‚Äôt believe science. wish wrong ultimately feel bad people die due heavy anti vaccine misinformation, us right do? Thats understandable, reason i'm tracking due countries taking case rates per 100k marker lists travel etc. currently stands allow travel US case rates per 100k sit around 3 4x higher ours. I'm concerned really family US i'd really like see :/  Aka never Everything Abbott done covid executive orders narrowly tailored suit current pandemic. Nothing applies future ones this. Slaves would still count 3/5 person deciding many Representatives state has, also apportioning direct tax quotas across states. (Except, Congress never actually passed direct taxes, last part never mattered. income tax different, per 16th Amendment.)

Meanwhile, President would probably get chosen Congress. Several delegates pushing popular election he'd less controlled Congress, delegates afraid people know candidates well enough pick wisely.  WTF  Great news. 

It'll interesting see we're couple months. current drop likely mostly driven vaccines, also worth noting climate factors playing role, (May low point cases year ago). 

Will states like TX -- saw dramatic rise cases last June/July -- see another increase next month, enough immunity vaccinations prior infections point COVID able get foothold again?

If guess, see substantial waves, there's enough twists throughout whole year can't say I'm 100% confident sample size low ever know true death rate vaccinated individuals, it'll low.

Made lower drugs treat covid which, time next year, hard find.  could. Good thing executive order current time tail-end current pandemic. gb

**Edit:** cat weighed in, ahem. thought supposed game-changer countries distribution problems. super-cold refrigeration needed two-shot regimine. Aside fairness would doubt LOT whining too, saves parent that. mostly sense fairness. Well, exponential decay always going see slow time. looks linear short timeframes, decay even truly exponential national level driven mix various states different curves. 

All said, likely see cases flatten coming months. states well way herd immunity continue see declines, albeit slowly. states (e.g., Deep South, even rural areas within states otherwise immunity) likely see fluctuating cases (at low level) virus moves endemic normal seasonality trends random variations driving small growth declines time. 

I see Indian variant driving much increase. UK variant already widespread US, unclear whether Indian variant materially contagious UK variant, nowhere near vaccine-resistant South African variant (and SA variant likely contagious UK/Indian variants).  Heard mentality?.. get soon possible. don‚Äôt know might change another month. tied political identity US? Blacks/Hispanics lowest rate vaccination US. Republicans. neither fully vaccinated Americans visit Canada. Yep, super logical. Simultaneously want urge us keep great, great work also shots yell LET'S F\*CKING GOOOOOO

You answered ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care‚Äù.

I wasn‚Äôt talking you. It‚Äôs YOU. parents option get 2nd dose AZ 25th May, around 8 weeks 1st dose.

I‚Äôm arguing since one goes out, get 12 weeks apart, scared want get 2nd dose asap. 

What do? 2nd dose really help given 8 weeks? Efficacy 8 weeks 60% 12 weeks 82% basis read? India reference. Esp confused since UK shortened duration coz UK variant. duration matter much real world results?  50 million Americans 65 years older. Many serious health conditions. 3/5 compromise look like without electoral college?  SARS2 believed able integrate random nonviable chunks genome cells. Maybe long covid cases involves immune response vaccine clears.  absolutely insane US closed vaccinated tourists EU wide open unvaccinated visitors rest world. way get rid unlawful measures suing government. You‚Äôre fully vaccinated. Pfizer trial results based 7 days second shot. CDC says 2 weeks everyone make easy  today, see correct. going well mask mandates today declared unenforceable Please look number people 0-17 died COVID March 2020 May 2021. Less 300.

That‚Äôs less half number children die accidental drownings every year. You‚Äôd save children banning bathtubs swimming pools forcing kids wear masks schools. I've got spreadsheet tracking case decline US day etc. concerning beginning show slow decrease cases? Following prediction case decline due flatten next week week etc. factoring India variant could cases increase again? Sadly ur parents bit racist. Regardless maybe order something else next couple weeks. They‚Äôre still trying scare people cases talk huh...


Even though cases haves trending weeks.

Exactly! come money. gets people store. know much likely go store requiring masks. someone wants wear mask I'm done hassle CDC think need mess anymore. Yes, operating normally. believe number 18 killed severely impacted virus would we‚Äôd continued full business usual mitigation? educated guess numbers would been? Yeah still don‚Äôt understand going upbeat message. focused negative messages.

Seems like reporting focusing positive referring alleged police action, mandate. LOUDER PEOPLE BACK lot medical pros scratching head CDC announcement.... 1) arent even near 50% population fully vaccinated 2) theres easy way places check vaccinated vaccine police 3) people lie wont wear mask puts others risk.  new employees probably won‚Äôt able work international

Oh, that's why.

I'm boat of, chances vaccines prevent people dying get COVID.  *very* interesting angle occurred me.  CDC said it‚Äôs local leaders decide mask mandates. also said unvaccinated need mask up. propose ensure happens get rid mandates? supposed intentionally fail meet CDC guidance?

Welp, guess going another wave fall/winter. like AI generated art. ,,77[object]-reshape00[unexpected]=clever  Right??? Idk hell they're pulling bs numbers from. case numbers still high?

Shouldn't much lower high vaccination rate? Enjoy rising cases

Cases rapidly decreasing weeks now, that's ease mask mandates. Additionally, people receive doses age groups become capable vaccinated, virus even harder time spreading, making dramatic rise cases even less likely cease wearing mutations vaccine-resistant strains

It incredibly rare pathogens mutate ways fundamentally alter way extent necessary shield effects vaccines. SARS-COV-2, mutation rate slightly slower viruses, lowering chances further. again, since vaccine drive natural heat spring summer force cases even down, making emergence vaccine-resistant strain even less US screwed mentality.

""If repeat ad infinitum, maybe people agree Covid far over.

In US, around 132,000,000 Americans fully vaccinated, meaning 98,000,000 fully vaccinated Americans away herd immunity. Today, gave 4,000,000 doses. Even lowest daily rate come expect - 2,000,000 - 149,000,000 Americans fully vaccinated *beginning* June, leaving us 71,000,000 away herd immunity. Even remaining 2,000,000 day, we'd still close herd immunity end June. June far claiming. Hawaii highest number Asians country, it? think mask wearing nearly stigmatized there.

Click bait title, gotta get add revenue That's mask mandate stupid since vaccine widely available. made sense vaccine know fuck going on. make sense keep dragging out.  40% Orleans parish total fully vaccinated (not eligible, that's percentage total population). consider many tourists now, effective rate vaccinated persons given area probably much lower lol I‚Äôd prefer masking kids get vaccinated September. offense vaccine acceptable everyone relatively recently? waiting like one month people actually going fully vaccinated start judging?

History side this. looking pandemic past, people openly refuse meds treatment never come well end. Jesus. 2 coworkers refused get vaccinated everyone work threw masks away. I'm like... hoo boy.

 Sure high risk area wearing one regardless like hospital nursing home case otherwise zero data show would actually make difference elsewhere.

You can't force someone get vaccinated, especially experimental ones authorized emergency use. dangers every time step front door. That's part life.

I've heard many people say feel Covid shot all. also true flu shot got earlier year ‚Äì hurt all. thought still preparing something (I looked away arm) already done. Since I'm German, eligible Covid shot last week. quite honest, hurt little bit, feel one, really little bit. bad all.

I believe depends relaxed arm muscles (you try relax arm much can), also depends vaccination skills person administering shot. case, doctor (like 60+ years old) probably used old-school vaccination skills. flu shot administered younger ""medizinische Fachangestellte"" (basically employee doctor's office practical medical education, University-level theoretical education ‚Äì responsible carrying treatments like injections, among things) looks like ""MFA"" education includes better injection training compared teach future doctors universities Germany. needle speedle! people vaccinate, people die due hospitals overcrowded, still might end huge hospital bills. bad also people want universal health care. absolutely agreed. pisses crowd said masks plot government cover us control us pissed mask mandates heavily easing around country vaccinations.

Once again, preacher unmoved. ""I shall remain. Lord see through.""

After levee breaks, flood rushes church steeple remains water. preacher there, clinging cross, helicopter descends clouds, state trooper calls megaphone.

""Grab ladder, Preacher. last chance.""

Once again, preacher insists Lord deliver him.

And, predictably, drowns.

Taste important, gives sense whether something okay eat not. eat chicken tastes gross it‚Äôs likely it‚Äôs spoiled. don‚Äôt know can‚Äôt taste smell it. 

Losing sense taste definitely isn‚Äôt trivial. alarmist top.

Asking unvaccinated people mask reasonable. Asking people get vaccinated reasonable. asking vaccinated people mask kind pointless.  Yet can't stop them. pat back getting put mask beneath nose public, doubt realized private lives socially distancing masking whatsoever. 

So rest us get vaccinated call day.  *slight* difference 70% vaccinated now. find hard believe lower 90%. *Money* That's true. hard imagine knowing anyone affected someone life dying covid. Although heard pretty strong denial going on- someone tests positive covid dies, no, must something else. think there's also stigma associated contexts. wasn‚Äôt proposing restrict access all. made feel lot better second thinking I‚Äôm vaccinated unvaccinated largely posing risk themselves, it‚Äôs fault die. pointing stupidity may lead vaccinated getting Covid could mutate to. maybe, maybe, everyone like AZ?

One previous examples used US public schools, much closer comparison, since actively done today, places cannot attend you‚Äôre vaccinated, scary sounding guess apartheid gets fear going better? ah well. talking generally. i'm generally puzzled japanese reaction whole pandemic sure? feel like rational thoughtful discussion behaviour around masks proof people mature truthful now. taken computers vision class, I've seen what's wild right consumers... Apple Photos identifies photos similar faces on-device. Facebook asks upload picture certain friend recognizes. Apple Photos even search things like 'bed', 'balloon', 'car', 'swim', etc return pictures content.

I think far fetched could take still photo notices face looking camera (tech point shoot), make attempt matching others using similar tech Apple, Facebook, etc. perfect get value it.

It may expensive, get tramendous value data. use tailor direct mail advertising. invest fortune stuff. companies pushed back hard ApplePay. made lot difficult track people. took Target 5 years finally give add support.... presumably found another way get data getting before.

We can't go Target aquarium ice cream stand public restroom now, one wearing masks. They've thrown parents kids bus timing this. even discussion they're presenting two-sided.

Get god damn vaccine I‚Äôm confused. hospitals sue patients unpaid bills, sell bills debt collectors suing.

This woman sued debt incurred prior pandemic.

What fact Missouri didn‚Äôt take pandemic seriously others? vaccinated people don‚Äôt like watching selfish unvaccinated people infect unvaccinated people. judge people certain religion based idiots.

There large populations non-religious anti-vaxxers COVID-truthers. Plus ""lockdown forever"" ideology, disproportionately secular sources, would far destructive long-term followed-through ignored. Throwing shade Christians amongst us blew mental gasket COVID bigotry. groups come looking good crisis.

The problem civilization truth warped around ideology motivated political minorities sides industrial scale. past year conversation reasonable combat biological/social/economic reality wasn't, loud political minorities went opposite extremes fired flaming arrows condemnation other. media magnified beyond proportion people felt like pick sides. We're lucky political-industrial-medical complex functional enough get us amazing vaccines miraculously quickly. There's guarantee true next time insanity keeps escalating.

Reasonable people need stand ideologues sides. Yeah, claiming children naturally better protected vaccinated adults spectacular enough claim needs sourcing.

I two kids young vaccine. true, would ecstatic. Bruh like 1/3 young people gotten vaccine. Actions speak louder words. Get yer fucken shots! lmao real dude saying.  b4 new ""USA"" strains found. anyone reading headlines experienced last 18 months

And think sources mentioned anything vaccines in, say, last decade? mention last year? fuck about? number comes trials. evidence otherwise I'm ears I'd rather correct info there. Before, wearing mask often rules like security reasons. I'll interested see comes back years. There's federal mandate saying wear mask forms transportation, intents purposes, illegal. agree that

Employers campuses mandating vaccination would get us long way boosting numbers Yes, Europe happily sold vaccines jealously guarding patents, profiteers misery sickness are.

The US actually donating 80 million doses. blows Europe's contribution 500,000 vaccine donations France  literally understand topic all. Coronavirus far pathogenic. risk catching getting sick coronavirus massively higher. Relative risk meaningless. Plague 70-90% fatality rate without treatment risk catching close 0%. Tennessee said: ""WHATEVER WANT."" big thing you‚Äôre missing comment every new infection chance mutations lead variants current vaccines even less effective against. certainly affect vaccinated. It‚Äôs set forget shield COVID, unless get 80-90% vaccinated case get close. sent too!! Lol Interesting Murphy diverging neighboring states, even NY MA. Wonder much flack he'll get. saw one guy argue one time line outside Sprouts Westwood. Security guard firmly enforced it. Ralph's UCLA security guards even enforcing nose coverage.  Costco, Walmart, Trader Joe‚Äôs, Starbucks even Cali announcing hard date indoor mandate lifted based new CDC guidance I'm sure much longer hold pushed farther lifted. made mistake watching whole thing began That's illegal means Means isn‚Äôt clear? point missing? live small rural town asked anyone real plague wear mask first place. really glad that‚Äôs people‚Äôs worst experience this, goes show little shit give anyone themselves. Exactly. lifting mask mandates premature right kids. reached herd immunity anywhere, figured way prove vaccination status, millions nitwits still gotten vaccine even though eligible. 

I'm sick this, kids stuck even longer now. Flu vaccines great, higher vaccination rate would reduce cases. Flu group viruses going away long birds, pigs, countless domestic wild animal reservoirs. Eradication really viable goal viruses (and could it, costs would different kind horrific - massive biodiversity collapse good anyone) - control treatment is. local school system go back October that's community started peak cases.

Yeah that's tricky one. Hope gets soon! I'm going send yet another OCD spiral writing yet another long explanation this. well known topic OCD world got google fingertips. No. shares place two friends. reaction what, though? Can't use reasons covid since lot America finally accepted like many countries already decades ago? They're beneficial many different ways. talking about? Fully vaccinated people get sick time, relatively rare 100% possibility. sign them.

It's like they're going call FBI analyze parents signature. It‚Äôs backlash ‚Äúit isn‚Äôt real‚Äù hard right crowd unable back accurate statement ^

If people want personally keep masking distancing that's fine support right so, get tsk tsk getting Fauci CDC given green light vaccinated people start shedding masks Fair, least there's that. still, I'm looking forward day one wear masks anymore. Oregon never gonna give mask :(    talking efficiency one shot age group folks gotten shots, again, moot point. ignoring fact?

You're basically arguing ""a jet half gallon gasoline cannot make destination."" I'm telling jet plenty fuel that's going issue, keep saying ""but studies show half tank fuel isnt enough"". real agenda? That's thing? tell difference?    think there, unfortunately Jokes you, Ohio literally amended health order today align CDC guidelines. masks required vaccinated. Though businesses still permitted implement rules shop there.

From summary email got like hour ago: fully vaccinated chance getting COVID incredibly low chance getting significantly sick infection near zero. Masking vaccinated simply supported science. mRNA-based vaccines developed tested (but licensed) use humans previously - for¬†rabies,¬†Zika,¬†cytomegalovirus, and¬†influenza. licensed production number reasons, get trials.

The Spike proteins proteins body would encounter non-mRNA vaccines, actual case covid. standard vaccine trials test component separately - one reasons vaccines designed way make sure part stimulates immune response around long enough actually stimulate response (this big challenge mRNA-based cancer treatment research - getting stick around long enough without destroyed body almost immediately). physically impossible mRNA vaccines alter DNA cause ""shed"" mRNA; that's simply works.

The mRNA-based covid vaccines went full clinical trial process. reason emergency FDA authorization temporal lack data due newness disease vaccine. data coming enough time passed, companies applying full approval signs point extremely likely (nearly certain).

I think ethical arguments mandatory vaccination general, I'm honestly sure stand myself. (I often glad bioethicist, making public health decisions.) 

But getting covid vaccine, even mRNA vaccine, outside actual clinical trial ""being experimental medical trial."" vaccines fully trialled already. soon, they'll full approval, interesting see leads uptick vaccinations whether people pivot different reason reluctant. local fire marshal shut every business ever to. definition shutdown inaccurate. live you? make him. think CDC believes there‚Äôs enough immunity drop masks

the CDC‚Äôs position drop masks *if you‚Äôre totally vaccinated.* totally reasonable. everyone wants react intentionally unreasonable way, CDC‚Äôs bad, especially since everyone intentionally idiotic CDC even said anything. Modi fire. He's new villa. Prolly even checking news tbh. LOL K german health systems decentralized. federal states brewing little soup every gp odering scheduling far vaccines concerned. Currently ~half doses go gps, thats supposed increase soon. 

This play nice ~80% population wanting vaccinated fast possible leads frustation seen above. 

Even so, coming July everyone first dose (maybe august). Facial expressions important person learning like see everyone mask 24/7. need see children without mask learn human facial expression. 

You sound like people Excuse me, sir, mask nose.

What fuck say, nerd?

Uhm, ass looks good pose!

Good, thought jutting hips enough! go now? argument masking partially based upon idea ok one person endanger another breathing openly enclosed spaces. vaccine available, way protect virus. Therefore little consequence people do. want risk COVID choice affect way. 

The problem people eligible vaccinated yet weakened immune system. protected herd immunity vaccination reaches certain level.

That number still goddamn terrifying. J&amp;j measured 14 days others 30+ comparable way even read article, fucking moron?  store, anywhere. lifting mask mandates everywhere doomed family another 6 months semi isolation 1 4 year old kids get vaccinated. Maybe that's public schools‚ÄîI never remember vaccination requirements.  ...
That's bad. somebody lives isolated life choice rarely gets colds, I'm pretty sure people giving masks way credit deserve interacting people primary reason they're getting sick. say masks effective never wore mask that's I'm coming conclusion. hand? still allergies something helped there. eyes watering, nose stuffed. IDK people suddenly cleared those. mean worried schedule around days go J&amp;J really obsessed.

Many people side effects almost always gone 1 day Woah think got one summer 2019. suddenly came it. Got headache lost voice span couple hours feeling fine. sick couple weeks fever, weakness phlegm stuffed up. regain voice couple months. Even breathing function feel 100% couple months after. young high risk complications personally would concerned gotten J&amp;J. 

If say 70 year old diabetic heart problems might think twice either way well protected severe problems. literally linked CDC website. find source equivalent standing stating young children higher risk severe illness COVID, means do. 

Otherwise kindly leave. can‚Äôt guarantee won‚Äôt get side effects vaccine hydrate, hydrate, hydrate after. Liquid IV stuff took definitely helped.

Suburban Northern NJ. know it‚Äôs different elsewhere man can‚Äôt imagine waking Target months ago without mask. never said much. said people would likely use masks incorrectly, expect masks afford protection offer, negative outcomes. also implied would strain manufacturing impact healthcare mask accessibility. 

They hesitant suggest non-mask alternatives, cloth based coverings, reinforces misunderstanding. Yeah, don‚Äôt get wrong I‚Äôm destigmatizing masks US, believe happen many parts post pandemic. (And think SARS might forcing function destigmatize East Asia, might mistaken.)

But public health economic standpoint, better sick leave policies culture declining social obligations sick might effective. anything, Memorial Day opportunity NJ double requirements. used sure, I'm not. really seem incorrect information. I've searched Josh Frydenberg saying ""mid-2022"" can't find it. closest 2022 already known, since Australia shortage vaccines late order Pfizer vaccines.

I'm saying every government, perhaps apart New Zealand, acted ideally combat pandemic, UK govt since day one utter morons. 

Everything little late, decide whether reopening various stages last year. pinnacle idiotic eat help scheme, encourage people go eat restaurants. provide financial support scheme let people use get takeaway mix inside restaurants nobody vaccinated.

Fucking idiots lot them. Anti maskers overlap anti vaxers pretty heavily

No anti-vaxxers dont want shedding wear masks Hi!

I‚Äôve conversations family getting vaccine, they‚Äôre worried long term effects vaccine. care weigh this?  Me, arm less sore second time, still young too. we're pedantic, antidotes toxins, viruses. Also vaccines cure, prevent infection Nah neck gaiter. know they‚Äôre effective preventing transmission, fits needs got mine 27 days mine due weekend weren‚Äôt administrating weekends anymore. old you? mean don‚Äôt answer mean you‚Äôre 12 up, could look state laws regarding parental consent vaccinating. vary state. Maybe could figure way near place vaccinate without parents.
Edit ~ sorry answered below. Best luck you. Hmm aspca? want kids lol. Actually, unemotional person. raised ton common sense, though. Good luck spoon fed numbers. hope serve well life. Eh vaccinated whatever. Need vaccinated people take mask show unvaccinated crowd longer afraid  Wal-Mart Starbucks undid latch floodgates we're going see major chains drop mask policy required strong suggested unvaccinated people would avoid target im fully vaccinated making big deal nothing?

yes released new set videos every month corporate people would put apron would never wear otherwise, say shit like ""we together"". made sure keep everything date man stupid. entire state NJ... bc Gov really doesnt want second term issue like destroy family, vaccines least worries. shaming insulting people action much better strategy, opposite comment does. CDC making laws/ rules. All. tell fact: Vaccinated People go without mask. risk getting sick small chance transmitting it. 

It's government want act information. 

Can imagine, 3 months now, news broke proof Vaccinated people posed little/ risk, information withheld? attitude flipped science *whatever* months back. glad deleted piece shit app last year. SW KY here, much same. Hopefully cycle back sex drugs. need lovin' going on. would even make training videos included masks? one thought they'd around year, Home Depot  already people wearing last week live.

Water, water, water!  Kinda seems like depends are. Chicago seen anyone without mask inside grocery/retail store. Bars/restaurants different story ummm no. thats something anything fully vaccinated won‚Äôt develop serious symptoms, chosen vaccinated well that‚Äôs them. So, point big fucking deal Hi Dr. Spyropoulos,
Seeing blood clot formed due vaccine low blood platelet levels, someone lower blood platelets increased risk?
Are common ‚Äúfactors‚Äù among people developed blood clots covid-19 vaccine?
Thanks!  basically impossible compulsory vaccination become thing Poland. would definitely cause nationwide protests.

A workable scheme would allow businesses card door. shirt, shoes, shot, service. Keep people enough fun/convenient spots they'll get vaccination. capacity controls high-impact measures mask recommendation low cost low impact. Every expert always said masks would last thing go this.

Aren't capacity controls high-impact measures already lifted places? masks last thing go.  get that, specifically regarding situation, would involved two fully vaccinated people, alone. got mRNA vaccines. 

Covid never gone 100%. chances getting transmitting decreased 90-95% - us. Us meeting without masks safe things possibly be, she‚Äôs still open it. 

That‚Äôs problem. Yeah, everyone get vaccine believe that. I‚Äôm sure relates comment. Turns dentist hesitant. like hygienist told Dr still unvax'd next time need one, I'm gone. Perfectly justified... imagining someone trying go Boratkini. ""This america! prescription bikini... Regular clothes suffocates me."" Behold everyone. Someone internet admitting wrong. may never happen  one point summer, actually armed security guard managing line went way parking lot get store. actually slept half time give two shits Contact lawyer sure would help data iwas new disease. sure much data virus acts, gets spread gets spread. Yea. can't tell link peer reviewed? expect reviewer (if editor even passed review) would ask exactly authors. think that's reliable way knowing Texas actually seems ahead everyone buddy. 0 COVID deaths seen flip side, also people fence think announcement means herd immunity reached need vaccinate anymore. I'm sure going result less vaccination, never mind less transmission. increase anti-maskers anti-vaxxers puzzling. would think would killed last year COVID leaving pro-science folks continue conversation. Or, least, anti-maskers anti-vaxxers would witnessed loved one dying COVID changed tune. It‚Äôs legit question. You‚Äôre claiming singled protection. didn‚Äôt others rate? Beautiful analogy.  good Going forward work assumption mask = vaccinated mask = vaccinated CDC Trump tried get schools open intention infecting kids get with. Haha quiet. Nobody killed Pfizer moderna vaccines. None conspiracy nonsense. US transparent blood clots J&amp;J vaccine. heck talking about?

I patient Friday- 18yo young man, admitted pneumonia, Covid tested ER- negative. Came floor night shift. come find O2 sats dropped 86% 97% room air overnight, febrile, nausea/vomiting/diarrhea, loss smell communicated report. place 3L get 94%. fingers begin turn progressively purple, drawing blood foot (veins seemed flat regardless IV hydration), toes too. got D-dimer Covid swab, CBC w/D, CMP. D-dimer came back 1.56, however platelets 54. gave Enoxaparin 70 mg SQ sent CT w/ w/o contrast. Negative PE, positive Covid. 

My question is- right thing giving lovenox? shipped bigger hospital, dont know outcome, however I‚Äôm worried may experiencing Thrombolytic Thrombocytopenia. typically see elevated D-dimer, low platelets, purple fingers toes type complication? Thank you.

ETA: cousin, age, died ‚Äúpneumonia‚Äù two weeks prior. presented symptoms 1 week duration. Hgb/Hct WNL, white count. year later still this... bruh Agreed. I'm California I'd prefer goals 7-day average new cases &amp; deaths, hospital capacity &amp; 1st dose vaccinations. we've hit 4 unmask inside. Something like that. might put little peer pressure people get shots.

Then everyone's still wearing masks stores I've last days. I've seen bit less outdoor masking, that's it. That‚Äôs weird way spell ‚Äúhead‚Äù??  Well, nothing general stinkeye. watch dude walking stereotype walk store wearing Murica (sleeveless shirt too, addition goatee wrap around mirrored sunglasses) walk mask. happened sitting car walked back store, carrying nothing.

Who goes grocery store without buying anything? dude looking pick fight. wanna say last September. Government action highly unlikely, effective way, CDC giving employers cover endanger us day one, changed much many hoped Biden got there, disavowel mask suggestion prime example.

When thing started, employer (like mine) could refuse let wear mask, CDC admit respiratory virus spread air, forced admit spreads air, still held water droplets aerosols, admitting forced open letter scientists fall.

Those can't get vaccinated, trust wrong people information choose to, collateral damage politically minded governmental health officials CDC see political expediency, except ones crying masks appreciate it, breed contempt bowing demands.  ask. doesn‚Äôt allergies. It‚Äôs ‚Äújust wants extra safe‚Äù. doesn‚Äôt trust science.

CDC estimates overlap around slightly 50% overlap. 60% vaccinated 30% got it, 72-75% population pretty strong immunity. students allow held back. I'm teacher confidently say seniors fine. applied year ever thought would, showed lot perseverance tenacity. long bring adulthood, they'll fine. middle schoolers whose near entire middle school experience pandemic I'm worried personally. please explain indoor businesses included metaphorical ‚Äúconstruction sites‚Äù, mass transit in-person schools included? vaccines prerequisite children admitted preschools elementary schools? 

No. fact, kids allowed get vaccine, sent back school today (in town, anyway).  Franklin Graham came today said vaccine good thing people get it. need amplify that.  start over. Even anti-vaxxers, billions people planet get vaccine time soon. Even money intent, can't vax 8 billion people quickly. virus find places spread mutate. global air travel, anything popping someplace eventually find way everyplace.

We learned lot new vaccination development go around. doubt get done even faster next time. would cut job half perfect single dose method. even nasal spray vaccines current trials say well. I‚Äôm Orange County haven‚Äôt seen anyone throw fit mask wearing stores frequent (Walmart, Target, Ralph‚Äôs).  lot us 90 =/= 100. JnJ crowd 75=/= 100. Vaccine works it‚Äôs best everyone gets it. protection community necessarily individual, we‚Äôre 56% US first shot. tired. I‚Äôm tired getting close 0 everyone relax early cases go back extending longer. Motherfockaaa Lie?

At point somehow read that, considering never even implied it?

I said ""give us lead time. Coordinate authorities better.""

At point even go close ""lie people"". went paper sent read work cited page. read first half cited works. one said masks decreases rate infection respiratory disease. one said difference wearing mask wearing one sample size 36 2 infections whole time, one group. like 7 papers showing masks help one terrible sample size (like shamefully low, tried turn professor I'd gotten laughed low) said break even 8 papers. sources says work read it.

Also, yesterday read cdc announcement March 6th 2020 saying non N95 masks help well. 

I noticed dropped trying explain virus smaller gaseous particles.

Dr fauci's paper spanish flu doesnt even mention masks weekend, dad told went hardware store without mask (fully vaccinated), went aisle mom two kids, wearing masks. saw him, said grabbed kids put behind said kids vaccinated yet leave. Nothing wrong cautious that's want be, drag others like that. Yeah, puts tough spot. He's great job I've seeing multiple years (minus past year I'm comfortable video sessions), might end wanting consider searching another case. Thank reassurance best way prevent variants get many vaccines risk countries possible Sure maybe can, don‚Äôt think anyone would actually WANT teach mask on. thought year pretty insane. Why? Cries Chicago absolutely correct New York state idea need vaccine passport called Excelsior pass. Perhaps that's states like New Jersey New York state vaccine passport way Human Services Centers Disease Control guideline vaccinated need masks indoors. hard wear mask? You‚Äôre punished. It‚Äôs mask.   mom felt recently. shitty immune systems [hers shitty condition has], *can't* get vaccinated. risk great. consolation we've 43k cases around 350 deaths entire county point, least pretend I'm less risk would lived bigger/denser area. pediatrician said kids literally nothing worry respect COVID.

My divorce attorney told get tax advice tax attorney. pediatrician expert this, sorry. pediatrician expert public health. Discussion serious adverse events per FDA briefing document nothing clots Pfizer vaccine tell would reported happened. quote:

In all-enrolled population (total N=43,448), proportions participants reported least 1 SAE time period Dose 1 data cutoff date (November 14, 2020) 0.6% BNT162b2 vaccine group 0.5% placebo group. common SAEs vaccine group numerically higher placebo group appendicitis (0.04%), acute myocardial infarction (0.02%), cerebrovascular accident (0.02%), placebo arm numerically higher vaccine arm pneumonia (0.03%), atrial fibrillation (0.02%), syncope (0.02%). Occurrence SAEs involving system organ classes specific preferred terms otherwise balanced treatment groups, including imbalance overall cardiovascular serious adverse events.
Appendicitis reported SAE 12 participants, numerically higher vaccine group: 8 vaccine participants ([appendicitis [n=7], appendicitis perforated [n=1]) 4 placebo participants (appendicitis [n=2], appendicitis perforated [n=1], complicated appendicitis [n=1]). vaccine participants (n=8) 2 placebo participants younger 65 years age. cases considered unrelated vaccination study investigators occurred frequently expected given age groups. FDA agrees clear basis upon suspect imbalance represents vaccine-related risk.
Three SAEs reported BNT162 group considered investigator related vaccine vaccine administration: shoulder injury, ventricular arrhythmia, lymphadenopathy. investigator sponsor thought shoulder injury related vaccine administration. Two SAEs BNT162b2 group none placebo group considered investigator, Sponsor, related study vaccination: shoulder injury (n=1), ventricular arrhythmia participant known cardiac conditions (n=1), lymphadenopathy temporally following vaccination (n=1). FDA‚Äôs opinion following review adverse event narratives, two events considered possibly related vaccine: shoulder injury possibly related vaccine administration vaccine itself, lymphadenopathy involving axilla contralateral vaccine injection site. lymphadenopathy, event temporally associated biologically plausible. Good point scheduling fucks over.

You‚Äôll see lot uptake summer. Especially vaccines likely required person colleges. I've that, things. They're worth it. countries giving to? 

115 million people vaccinated, 1136 hospitalized, 223 died. maybe little 1 1 million still nearly statistically insignificant. uncle contracted fully vaxxed weeks ago. immediately treatment felt much better next day. wife president hospital network (as well former Dr) thought best course action him.

""Vaccinated people need masks, unvaccinated people do, enforcement states local governments"" far mandate drop mask mandates. Heck, keeping universal mask mandate can't prove vaccination status could easily argued pro-science situation, due one key parts guidance unvaccinated people absolutely still wear masks. think recall quite reps giving statements media waiting OSHA okay guidance huge step forward work food service agree - makes easier safer around food.

Living life mitigating risks enjoying yourself. get that. Except premature removal safety measures make harder strike balance reduce risk. mitigation unvaccinated kids now. took last options away. 

As herd immunity protecting kids...I disagree entirely there. Herd immunity protects unvaccinated people time infectious diseases. reached level yet. It‚Äôs doable it‚Äôs nothing like wearing cloth mask. things tight. sister surgeon (I got masks hospital) even complains time. Easiest move exactly year. fair, Target pharmacies many stores easily arrange associates get vaccine there. Lowes everybody else bending backwards accommodations staff get vaccinated. right thing do, makes economic sense well. vaccinated employee less likely need two weeks Covid scare.  got second Moderna shot hour ago, college final paper turn tomorrow afternoon. I'm trying get done fast quite frankly clue going react shot, whether sore arm something beyond that. However, still happy nevertheless. Half sub apparently knows CDC judging often circlejerks starts-up threads related change guidelines Factor V Leiden. people like know already increased risk getting blood clot? holy shit lmao act like there‚Äôs big cost wearing mask. Unfortunately death efficient preventing infection known vaccine.  sure stores area vaccines work *fucking great,* friend. Tens millions people vaccinated, hundreds still gotten seriously sick. year ago, you‚Äôd told they‚Äôd *that good,* would told living fantasy land. They‚Äôre way beyond expectations. California looks track one states herd immunity. people know couldn‚Äôt wait get shot gotten now. I‚Äôm basically going surrounded inoculated people. Why? kids risk. arm hurt lot less first time. symptoms though second time (fever). Everyone family (Pfizer Moderna) said hurt first time ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Meijer dropped mask rules vaccinated customers, employees still wear masks OSHA says otherwise. Least time accessibility. scoured appointment sites hunted. Jumped car moment‚Äôs notice get leftover dose canceled appointment. Nowadays walk right in. update? going take people time. felt weird first time went relative's house go dinner 3/4 adults vaccinated. weird like 2 minutes like 2019 again. advice would hang however feel comfortable make clear fine hanging without masks whenever feel comfortable, wear one that's feel comfortable. suspect they'll relax pretty quickly. 

Not knowing going able eat suck though. Las Vegas Henderson. Nearly 100% people stores masks entire time. State mandated, businesses desperate get shut non-compliance Nope, whatever reason they're proud entitled breed Another month fuck Ricky Schroader? Totally worth it! California big, diverse state. 
You live one hyper speed counties. I'm familiar every area every state - cases increasing result mask mandate lifted? experience rural areas many mandate reality start with. CDC gave health safety information vaccinated people. near tell, gave useful **policy guidance** rules apply store restaurant mix vaccinated unvaccinated people good way tell apart. 4 year old attitude teenager. count? Tylenol hydration helps, either plan around existing days power shift. fairly bad side effects, absolutely work could have, would unhappy.  Right there. science says vaccinated people need masks, CDC updated guidance. Newsom overlooks science keep needlessly onerous restrictions. fact everyone vaccinated relevant. Im saying masks vaccinated keep wearing one. I'm saying guidelines updated reflect data vaccinated. never zero Covid, 100% vaccine efficacy, 100% vaccination rate. can‚Äôt redefine safe mean risk-free. you‚Äôve fully vaccinated, you‚Äôre safe, period, regardless anyone else does. Again, risk-free, safe. ultimately info you. sincerely hope you‚Äôll find ways live fulfilling life, can‚Äôt expect eradication risk. personally severe allergies spring summer masks dont make better. guess case case thing. waited still clear now. Lowest age bracket well. hate cdc this. thanks making customer service workers' lives hell Honestly OSHA skip chase encourage employers require proof vaccination enter workplace.  antibody test receiving Pfizer vaccine take see immune system immune response? cancer survivor chemotherapy radiation therapy past. get it! I‚Äôm fully vaccinated, mask ain‚Äôt going anywhere. usually really bad seasonal allergies. Usually, I‚Äôve taken daily Zyrtec Zyrtec D, depending pollen count. year, I‚Äôve taken maybe 3 doses Zyrtec precaution days high pollen counts. 

All people said masks made hard breathe clearly haven‚Äôt suffered severe seasonal allergies! Mission accomplished 2 years, let's stay another 18 years sure. Diabetes shouldn‚Äôt effect vaccine efficacy. Diabetic people normal immune systems unless another immune condition. We‚Äôre looking first doses instead second doses? It‚Äôs better go first doses future predictions, though, people one dose get second dose time comes. That‚Äôs means. feel like receiving mini booster shots speak every time exposed. What's though? could walk covid filled room without mask still get covid...you're fully vaccinated matter idiots around do. would say exceptional Yeah, many people one popular state country. 95% effective means 5% chance catching covid exposed, take highly exposed areas 5% meaningful. going make huge difference vaccine waste.   Based today's CDC's numbers, 47.5% US vaccinated, assume estimate 50% overlap, brings us 62.5%.  


Ultimately question asking is, truly reached herd immunity, seen daily new cases sharply decline like UK Israel? still seeing daily new cases 3X larger UK, normalizing population size.  Israel, daily new cases 25X larger Israel's, normalizing population. tells us got yet, else we'd seen cases plummet like UK Israel.  


Here comparison, normalized population: also notice spring break surge US around April. Last April shared meme first lockdowns extended May picture Justin Timberlake said next time see face GONNA MAE can't believe meme ended right (albeit year later expected) honestly think CDC gives shit. washed hands issue kicked bucket someone else honor system. cases arise responsibility last person holding potato. Why? Unless underlying health issue, assuming she‚Äôs 20 years old healthy chances COVID taking life incredibly slim. Oh meant masks aren‚Äôt going away quite time, way life work now.

Crazy enough she‚Äôs spent probably 1/4 past year N95 still smarter four NNN blokes combined.  Kinda ruins hope man kind little though Yeah, needs kind normal context it. ""You wear mask might risk spreading nasty germs"". reason wash hands shitting. wear pants mass transit. Yeah sorry friend didn‚Äôt think call ask. Seems like younger folks forget phone place question. good thing kids summer, none rambling incoherent stream consciousness even relevant. Everything I‚Äôve told mask doesn‚Äôt protect wearer nearly much protects people *from* wearer. kids wearing masks doesn‚Äôt necessarily solve issue unless really trust anti vaxxers abide honor system wear masks.

I‚Äôve said comments: think happy medium could keep indoor masking essential locations allowing freedom vaccinated adults want resume normal lifestyle non-essential locations like bars restaurants concert venues. US, children 15 car accident death rate 1.5/100000 **for entire year**. 287 deaths due covid recorded far ages 17 under. population 74 million, that's death rate 0.39/100000 covid far.

The odds dying 10 minute car ride way lower, wrong think they're anywhere close. 16,000 new cases us yesterday says otherwise dummy target's near really good enforcing masks, cleaning carts, make things feel safe. im texas at? Everyone wearing masks everywhere still - although many many fewer outside. Same. used regularly get 4-5 colds year 2-3 would turn bad cases bronchitis. last 18 months I‚Äôve 2 mild colds least one probably seasonal allergies. Open border, BC calling me! Even first weeks really lockdown. Huge percentage people ""essential"". Wanting people vaccinated opposite straw man made. Classic Emma, man Everyone says big deal, still kind dick move create system unvaccinated people going run rampant people proper chance fully vaccinated. 

My state opened everyone April 19th. got day might still second dose yet. 

Sure means already lower risk, also wait longer vaccine definitely put elevated risk vs. people priorities. get shoved unvaccinated people also. 

If there's another health crisis they're told wait prioritize people? Fuck that! sacrifice people wait 3 weeks get protection able get earlier? wearing cloth masks indoors? literally tiny ask. Yes actually risk fully vaccinated 30 year old (mortality-wise least). Yep. sweaty, caused acne redness, trouble understanding people wear masks (although hearing fine, found read lips thought did). Everybody know refusing get vaccinated exact reasoning. 

They don‚Äôt like idea taking vaccine hasn‚Äôt years data show possible side effects.

It‚Äôs refusing they‚Äôve misinformed, it‚Äôs hasn‚Äôt clinical trials long enough long term effects known. 

This general consensus I‚Äôve heard people life. 

At end day, it‚Äôs case bodily autonomy.  people sub happy it. front page high upvote ratio. Even location, I've seen mixed responses. younger staff tends non-confrontational older staff let know. cool!

Ka pa Canada! 5G vaccine millimeter sized technology float around air. Yes concerned death, biggest concern children. 
I've displeasure unrelenting fatigue non-covid infection altered life significant ways (I previous underlying conditions).
 Children experiencing on-going fatigue (and/or symptoms) much greater concern given research thus far. People realize significant concern children death. unhelpful argument covid-related instances. It‚Äôs really wrong right, it‚Äôs risk tolerance. basically stopped wearing mask unless go store cause changed rulings yet. Awesome news huge state. Hope see stat across US one day... You‚Äôre welcome  go Kroger bro. Takes 10 minutes. Say going ‚ÄúYoung Evangelicals Mistranslating Bible Trump‚Äù something wear masks public still. need though. Also spread virus small viral load matter. Antivaxxers also anti maskers. kid wearing mask doesn‚Äôt protect idiots unless buy expensive n95 masks throw every use.  Around 45% Republicans consistently said take vaccine: Yes China brought covid world heard Dr. Landon NPR. pretty much confirmed Nickel said. comment straight lie. problem :) somewhat true - much EU schools significantly open US kids &lt;12 mask (generally speaking). 

In addition, even looking published case counts, seems fairly clear odds hospitalization given diagnosis much higher flu. Part certainly test COVID flu, overall picture get one two diseases general area severity comes young children, seems CDC agrees. so? working rise shots.
They everywhere. Luckily daughter teen first one scheduled. agree understanding that, herd immunity isn‚Äôt reached, variants immune vaccinations emerge perpetuity. 

I could wrong  Well said I'm wondering getting voted yet approach correct way knowing one vaccinated not? There's vaccine hesitancy Canada too, dummy. Absolutely correct also reflected Twitter mask Mandate. tweets date back May 14th us kids diseases like diabetes make covid dangerous Thank oh wise tittyman1 antibodies two shots still mask. Also fuck target. fuck not. bartender abs returning normal life means money. people getting vaccinated physically able ones want make go forever ones saying don‚Äôt. reaching herd immunity free vaccine.  Thanks! family driving away Facebook something?

This beautiful comment. attended public school last 20 years? CDC says unvaccinated people wear masks, would obviously include children. Oh yeah? Well America weird dumb! Hah! dunno big deal people. really don‚Äôt get it. It‚Äôs little effort protect fellow man really inconvenient wear mask. I‚Äôm fully vaccinated I‚Äôll continue wear mask till scientific consensus says otherwise happy show empathy community.

I think OP criticizing hypocrisy certain groups people. ‚ÄúTrust CDC... unless guidelines inconvenience me!‚Äù I'm scared needles too. Feel fear anyway Emma! poutine border open? worries, gotcha. feel like always find people insanely unrealistic expectations complain met.

It's similar everyone felt like bigger countries like US, Canada, etc.. achieved New Zealand eradicating COVID. They‚Äôre going stay hunkered get it. Sounds like it‚Äôs far away. Bruh kids need social interaction I‚Äôm eager lose mask, think that‚Äôs excellent respectful rule thumb.

He....predicted another wave happen. big difference, though. earlier case, point make people forget COVID (I guess), incredibly counterproductive. Now, encourage people get vaccine, worthwhile goal. could still backfire variants spread vaccine effective enough them, good harm vaccinations increase enough counteract reverse rise potential transmission. real danger spread increases reopening/variants don't/can't take vaccine start catching spreading high rate- defensible choice new restrictions. different vaccines schools require? Yes fucking do. Yes! I‚Äôm excited! guy wants retweets huh? Barring cases like mother son came take care family member others pandemic on?

I'm southwestern suburbs wish could say same. state struggling keep vaccination rates compared rest country. one point time, single county state become fastest growing COVID hot bed world. 


As soon city govt said need wear masks upon vaccinated people stopped really fucking fast. 


It's crazy. Suddenly everyone stopped wearing masks. again, feel like odd one wearing mask. I'd inclined say 50/50 ratio would fair assumption. handed many vaccines. This. work crowded public venue. Tired management office staff working home Zooming meetings explaining they‚Äôve removed watered yet another safety protocol increases risk staff. ‚ÄúWe to‚Äù pfft. They‚Äôd heckuva lot concerned expected back building. no, decided extend work-from-home September... Unless evidence says mRNA vaccines killed someone, I‚Äôm going believe haven‚Äôt. actually blame California waiting drop masks once. I'm glad state changed mandate, caused lot confusion businesses still require them, don't, work's case require employees moment (although OSHA weighed hopefully they'll change that). practical decision scientific one, that's valid choice state make.

You're downvoted sub brigaded. comment suggests maybe perhaps wear masks distance *a little bit* longer downvoted, well comment suggests vaccines (while fantastic!) 100% immunity machines. Nuance difficult people here. Vaccines work lots people get them. way even though *aren't* perfect, effect still powerful. Breakthrough infections happen, incorrect say vaccines protect family 100%. friends immunosuppressed family member living them, someone co-morbidities makes vulnerable (or unvaccinated child!) could spread disease them, potentially putting family member risk. Target Red Wal Mart treatment could available early 2023, depending next phase clinical trials

Well.. glad see there's nothing look forward next year case me... know. (Side note hospital went efficient peace mind 20ft ER entrance).

... hoping go *to* said ER, I'm feeling unwell 4 days later. got years ago GREAT Thing do. honestly hadn;t realized much affected got off. great decision! go winter, totally made name---- zero friends check specific weather information. treat like URL , like webpage , feed, notifications go info way would webpage. hear one best decisions! Right on! What's point ? us jobs required us work pandemic frontline supermarkets, security, cleaners ""low"" end jobs us covid , included , take vax disease beat twice , uk youths take feel , there's large distrust obviously see saying, think one problems ""vax hesitant"" people might *that* discussion one sided, feel like agenda. people disparaged another opinion questioning something makes things worse. fear getting vaccine might medically sound, least understandable, addressing people's fears often effective saying ""we even explore side coin"".

Obligitory: I've received first shot, awaiting second, anti vax etc. would argue flu actually worse children. Example swine flu pandemic: Aug. 30, 2009, June 12, 2010, 279 lab-confirmed influenza-associated pediatric deaths reported. 
CDC estimates 43 million 89 million people became sick pandemic H1N1 strain April 2009 April 2010.   pediatrician saying kids safe virus. want believe children safe virus. Ive seen lot.   wore mask daily lived Korea months due cold weather fall winter, well spring due pollen. support normalizing masking way protect oneself around them. infectious covid is, there's remote chance kid get school (thankfully happened class, school positive cases since classes resumed, double thankfully since none class), I'd rather continue wear masks school, probably tell wear cloth one least classroom vaccinated since knows parents vaccinate children. people town think microchips vaccine government track get it..... got Johnson &amp; Johnson one. told phones already track gave blank stare. Congrats! Completely agree. She‚Äôs anti vax, siblings fully vaccinated recommended childhood vaccinations well COVID, she‚Äôs vaccine hesitant. think guidance reason got first dose. Lol tru Right us still weeks second dose. weird tangent choose. okay. legally allowed to, however turns there's weird safety issue vaccine, risk lawsuit. Obviously highly unlikely many schools employers gone forward requiring vaccine. guy already covid, he's also fully vaccinated.

Continuing wear TWO masks goggles everytime steps outside insanity. it‚Äôs stupid works‚Ä¶ choice wearing them, downplayed negative aspects wearing them, choice, there's medical benefit wearing it, I'm going go way wear little possible. I'm sick face sweaty sticking mouth every time inhale. fuck say? become clear race, least society reached evolutionary dead end. We've evolved point we're longer able make rational decisions adapt keep live red area lot people getting vaccinated,"" one respondent said. ""So know return campus, vaccinations mandatory 90% people would vaccinated. means campus would outbreak again.""

So many people choose abandon reason due superstition, plain small minded, negative, stubbornness, paranoid smart people trying put something them. shame prolong epidemic rest us. friends gotten yet? haven‚Äôt? That‚Äôs probably good, actually. situation drastically improved last months. Someone please tell we‚Äôre going safe assuming people honest follow new guidance honor system? herd immunity, we‚Äôre supposed trust people honest? Lol. vaccine cure. live society? I'm sure shocked hear: Missouri, South Carolina, Idaho, Wyoming, Tennessee, Louisiana, Arkansas, Georgia, Utah, Alabama, Mississippi. wear respirator mask long need feel comfortable. point able return normal life. We‚Äôre never going reach 100% vaccination...we likely won‚Äôt even reach high enough tier obtain herd immunity. ‚Äútrust science‚Äù applies vaccines too.

The number breakthrough cases minute illnesses largely asymptomatic mild cases. worrried vaccine could ruin fertility, seemed rushed, could long term side effects. discussed things day turned nasty didn‚Äôt sources ego. I'll get downvoted conspiracy theory lead project blue beam. Aliens man. Fucking aliens. Nj sure. That's usually exposed Covid before. Even get full blown case, got enough exposure immune system fight off, remembered caused bigger reaction encountered vaccine.  Honestly wouldn‚Äôt care wanted go concerts Applebee‚Äôs. easily avoid places. think offices essential stores still require masks indoors since people can‚Äôt really ‚Äòchoose‚Äô whether go there.  brother attended huge UFC fight Florida weeks ago. many experimental huge gatherings seen super spreader events idk  would assume percent people actually sign quite low, odds went significantly. Since kids recently approved receive vaccines, many kids still approved, doesn‚Äôt seem like pediatrician commenting vaccine breakthrough rates. I‚Äôm demanding non expert crowned expert, ‚Äúexpert‚Äù objective, immutable category pediatricians clearly fall outside of. Pediatricians generally expertise patients‚Äô susceptibility serious illness. 

The pediatrician question didn‚Äôt say want, wasn‚Äôt commenting kids.  back question, pediatricians‚Äô advice inconsistent anything ‚Äúpublic health experts‚Äù said? suffering none serious problems daily life imposed restrictions.

That's laughably moronic way describe mask mandate, especially since many businesses continued require makes lifted. course related China, Chinese labs Butantan's providers. fellow Turkish also stated, they're also receiving less contracted Chinese mass vaccinated. Seriously. also hate many people unable acknowledge real, social mental health benefits able see people‚Äôs faces talk them. kids, seen handful people‚Äôs faces year. It‚Äôs crazy! people really spoken sending vaccines abroad? good go. locality might settings masks still required, go entirely back normal. True lost don‚Äôt care lmao many trials done India‚Äôs variant?  Check Singapore news past week want see study happening live. *Average* Sat/Sun/Mon raw metrics:

You spin things trying average first half 2020 (which overall death stats do), doesn‚Äôt tell us shit what‚Äôs happening right now. 

The state leads nation deaths weekly either populous state bad place indeed. dozen dimentia-ridden people asylum called National Diet Building.

I feel sorry everyone lives Japan now. good ideas, messaged take long ""America Bad"" articles start resurface. That's great news Canada, I'm sure US needed mentioned headline.  politician pointing majority state fully vaccinated guidance even apply right now....  narrative behind based numbers. one job... idiots think new variants actually going amount anything. one getting sick anymore man. economy cant wait shit play longer has. god fucking dweeb lol hope 100% people get sick anti-vaxxers. Natural selection get rid empathy-lacking cretins, once. Good luck them. take masks away there's fucking way I'm getting plane.

I'd rather go way I'd feel comfortable flying. Require vaccines! saw poll month ago claimed 80% Canadians want get vaccinated, pretty great considering misinformation spewed days. Please seek mental help, brainwashed living needless fear we‚Äôve created culture fear safetyism. Look, I‚Äôve team safety since day one. glad closed schools, ok lock downs, I‚Äôve masked since beginning pandemic. Mainly ‚Äúfollowed science‚Äù. mainly know bad kids would get infected badly would spread schools, etc.

But know lot virus. doesn‚Äôt affect kids like adults. vaccinated very, low risk contract spread COVID. know surface spreading unlikely. know outdoor transmission extremely rare, etc. ‚Äúfollow science‚Äù means adjusting views based new evidence people don‚Äôt want change position based that. getting steady supply vaccines now, using az shots isn‚Äôt problem he‚Äôs making be, earlier would correct however. punish all...  idea floating around epidemiologist Twitter I'm really sure sort prep would needed change. sad bribe people get vaccine Please seek mental help, brainwashed living needless fear lol buddy. you‚Äôre still scared catching covid point, probably shouldnt leave house ever again. exactly leads people ridiculously poor understanding responsibility works? get sick me?

Honestly, he's super reasonable rational, people acting like shot puppy Please seek mental help, brainwashed living needless fear words‚Ä¶ conservative states representatives downplayed Virus? Nobody:

Redditor: gonna mask 2029. It‚Äôs soooooooooo fun! don‚Äôt even wash face anymore! Yes, yes Yeah, people understand. fact, lockdown looks like course action, time implementation highly controversial.

Ironically, pandemic get control many countries, it'd still condemned day. likewise locked Jan 5th got significant number cases. Honestly masks (and vaccines) required airplanes always been. have. I'm assuming studies looking children pediatrician would try stay date important ones. 

And expertise means understand knowledgeable topic. still expert newly established field Shopping alone pretty asocial activity also strangers around you, see one places masks remain decent amount time, along transit.  would fairly inexpensive make sure everyone finishing quarantine (instead migrant workers) got tested.

Wow, idea even testing everyone quarantine! NZ everyone quarantine 4 tests, one arrive airport flight, one arrival, one day 3 MIQ final one day 12. 

They may catching cases before, outbreak shows exactly danger testing community widely. idea NZ constant community surveilance testing wastewater testing let us know community transmission well reaches hundreds cases day. Hot vax summer I‚Äôd like expand dudes comment say sub really ‚Äúbrigaded‚Äù please let get paid day online. Sounds like either conspiracy theory sweet side gig.  can't hold unfortunately something high risk incorrectly caught point method flawed.

Which can't necessarily fault infection controls protocols difficult follow. One mistake doffing risk. HIPPA may mean context doctor health insurance can‚Äôt give vaccination status employer without consent. year wfh amazing fact attend office potlucks ""behind"" though. Or... slow start least, compared countries. Shipments really start ramp beginning April we're rolling full steam. honestly think they'll start moving second doses up, shipments set increase even coming weeks. thinking sense &amp; last year connection 2008/9 recession putting damper 2 cohorts' entire financial trajectory due less opportunities &amp; lower wages vs people graduated years earlier later. Missing compound interest beginning really hurt later on. time around, missing financial social connections. think really way make lost time either. 2020 graduates competing 2022/2023 graduates jobs, etc. might wrong think like businesses saying trespassing. right say can't enroll live dorms. State schools can't tell people walk campus though. Please correct I'm wrong. don‚Äôt enough data truly say it‚Äôs seasonal I‚Äôve researched, seem lot factors involving seasonal changes COVID. 
You say people indoors winter time, people spend ton time indoors summer it‚Äôs hot...so doesn‚Äôt seem like strong argument :/ Somehow we, mask wearers make everyone angry.

I actually thinking post saw someone observation view Americans irresponsible incorrect &amp; kinda smacks cancelled last year order responsible (in contrast to, example, biker rally Dakotas IIRC). However, better job mine comes whiny. Sorry that.

Besides, I'm kinda anti-social anyhow year big deal. Sure want get out, people far deserving sympathy - think deserve honest - far affected. I'm thinking people like parents friends 80s. literally much time left health measurably deteriorated last year. probably still good years - probably - count hands. hand, perhaps. others like loss immense. Plus rates higher time last summer, even lower last week. Somehow seem matter...  Again, vaccinated individuals. enforcing masks unvaccinated, possible, indoor spread continues problem. I'm pretty sure incapable rationalizing simple fact. yeah, maybe talk less, stop making unverified claims go get vaccinated. good luck. door, sure.  experience inside one said/did shit got noses sticking otherwise masked

So masked. mask protects others Vaccines offer complete protection, though specific case reduces severity infection. still possible household get infected spread others. also big problem can't receive vaccination. 

All around, sucks self centered ignorant population. know certainty. tool part problem.  I'm Nevada need conflate 'risk taking behaviors"" Las Vegas complete idiocy choose vaccinate. Take upvote good spirit. :) bit double edged sword. Outdoor masking (along generally staying indoors) lead sensitive seasonal allergens. I‚Äôm process slowly reintroducing raw outdoors.  Nah, local Target definitely did. Mask-patrol front store would hand masks mask less people ask leave Online Grocery Pickup, people shopping day big blue carts full totes. hope he's right. Really hoping cases low kids need soon. I'm NZ elimination strategy Taiwan. day one told vital thousands tests every day. That's vital part maintaining elimination. Anyone even slight cold flu symptoms urged test. never problem false positives. new argument. ""We must open up! But, also, want anyone able prove I'm vaccinated!""  seems like type thing would periodic training since people eventually forget. Seems wasteful use employees time cram last minute gets announced. Get vaccinated life depends it. go 3 different targets Twin Cities (one Saint Paul, two suburbs work). three ‚Äúgreeter‚Äù inside door since last summer saying hello checking masks. 

Target enforcing mask mandates pretty much anywhere else I‚Äôve seen I‚Äôll give 2-1 open. wish states would something like Ohio doing. Even something like state I‚Äôm (Washington) open everything restrictions set date (6/30) get 70% population first dose doesn‚Äôt seem like it‚Äôs going enough carrot 

i think states *SOMETHING* like Ohio would go long way think way.

Masks huge positive impact pandemic. They'll smaller positive impact pandemic. Still positive, though. I'd idiot criticize someone taking advantage that. Like, criticize people wearing mittens usually don't?

The anti-mask league anti-vax people *killed* thousands Americans. suck. impact extremely negative.

Small positive impact versus huge negative impact. even compare two? Yep, mention kids. Every time mention kids 12 exist can‚Äôt get vaccinated yet, it‚Äôs downvotes ‚Äúkids don‚Äôt get sick‚Äù ‚Äúkeep kid home then!‚Äù kids get sick don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs chance worth taking something simple easy masks prevent it. don‚Äôt even young kids.

Wahhhhh  correct whatsoever. risk death coronavirus massively higher vaccination arge groups. even remotely close. stats cited wrong. said below, lax super open understanding staff coming mental day off. problems breaking rules help people. guy many complaints coming work sick would enforcement look like though? Staff arguing them? Security escorting out? Anti maskers yelling staff‚Äôs faces? Assaulting them? police called?

It‚Äôd escalate situation put people work personal risk physical harm honestly infection COVID. That‚Äôs policy enforce strictly look half sources post, pathetic examples journalism don‚Äôt read them. Feel sorry you, hope lack critical thinking skills like, working you.

Scott Gottlieb (whose pretty good predictions) said foresees threat Covid poses US small enough basically nobody masking point June It‚Äôs CDC...they science. K bit cancer survivors high risk people boned indefinitely. 37% vaccinated state cdc notes flu deaths likely undercount estimates number 600.

Edit: also 25% youth get vaccinated flu. that‚Äôs quarter least protection I‚Äôm 90% sure point name negative thing happens human body they‚Äôll say vaccine causes  know, sounds like bit narc. Let days could mental health personal reason. always every time. Maybe I‚Äôm bit pessimistic it‚Äôs kept alive far careful rather less careful.

If continue wait antivaxxers, we'll never get purgatory we're in. Instead, sane Americans protected today, expect booster shots help variants future Society didn‚Äôt decide that...the CDC science decided workers lives *arent* risk fully vaccinated customers decide go maskless store. 

And even unvaccinated people also go maskless store, long vaccinated, wear mask choose, higher chance getting struck lightning twice row contracting covid.

If that‚Äôs low enough risk I‚Äôm sure else want us do. perform dangerous tasks way work chance contracting and/or getting seriously ill covid fully vaccinated. say don‚Äôt want it... they‚Äôll get it. saying you‚Äôre wrong, observation. funny whenever someone points pro China content upvoted anti-china content downvotes first response China, TenCent, invested Reddit heavily curate ends front page, manipulate votes, people ask pro China content downvoted anti-China content upvoted, response there‚Äôs anti-china bias west. see ways, it‚Äôs like nothing China related exist without someone‚Äôs ulterior motive Anyone know convince friend get shot?

If people going yell ZERO DEATHS headlines, think actually zero deaths? common practice parts world wear masks allergy influenza seasons. weird wear masks. really stunning politicized masks US. first trip big store maskless could tell else also first maskless trip since mandates kicked 

Like deer headlights trying decide navigate without mask physical-distancing optimized movement patterns worry less people protect themselves. easily cancel second dose appointment make make time, schedule new one different location. It‚Äôs elegant also hard. people nearly entirely immunized point. 


Until unvaccinated create another mutation we're immunized üòï flailing train wreck year. people smug smiling first time year don‚Äôt wear masks Target? 

Maybe you‚Äôve forgotten feels like see smile public... Let ask hypothetical question: deadly, disease kills 3% people catch it, infect 10% population? one kills 1% catch it, infect 50%?  don‚Äôt?

How would go that? got mine Thursday scheduled next one me.

They wanna give, wanna give ‚Äòem jabbies? know right? 7,000,000,000 people earth, would ever think  Yeah, I've heard places, though. Really miss living places Meijer, Target, Kohls, etc. think there's Kohls exits now, though. again, children? be, there's enough China protect populace.

But going many Australia borders closed everyone becomes increasingly absurd passing day Seriously, it‚Äôs fucking bullshit. followed CDC guidelines I‚Äôm sure hell following one, too. I‚Äôm science-denier. Nothing changed. enforcement. Didn‚Äôt matter Yeah socially I‚Äôm worried middle schoolers. They‚Äôre gonna go high school acting weird I'll keep wearing mine, thanks think key part point. us go work every day getting vaccine huge relief. something break vaccine vaccine's protection wore boosters could produced us would back risking lives working. Nobody's going take seriously without sourcing information, importantly sane head shoulders parse information properly. 

Vaccines 100% safe. cause anaphylitic reactions, vaccines (J&amp;J, AstraZeneca) low blood clot risks. safety far exceeds coronavirus infection risk, that's we're using them. Why? You‚Äôre vaccinated? Maybe leave frames, rest us know avoid public sans masks. ""Masked vaxxed"" applies children exactly same. They're old enough get vaxxed, guidance wear masks.  not? Masks work directions. Keep mask kid fine.

This we've kids. Drive pickup way go. love it. haven‚Äôt shopped inside Target since last March. want protect infants can't get vaccine wear mask, keep wearing masks!  ‚ÄúRemote learning nailed...‚Äù

Comical. invite watch educational day first graders receiving remote vs in-person instruction.

As stated, risk SARS Cov2 different flu young children. They‚Äôve lost year young lives protect others. require vaccination resume normal life. Damn, living opposite sides country like living two completely different countries sometimes huh? That's weird never seen Safeway whole foods, even know Kroger's Shrug. Well, suppose right get vaccine (unless can't get vaccine medical reasons) sympathy get COVID makes sick. it‚Äôs insane cdc came like Oh ffs essentially risk children. Time move fuck on. Don‚Äôt believe one bit. piles body bags Florida, Texas, every city notable population never hidden. We've *all* seen pictures refrigerated trucks used store morgues filled up. sure, nothing happened. 50,000 dead Texans, overblown. FIFTY. THOUSAND. HUMAN. BEINGS. died government told virus hoax. liberal fever dream. 

Y'all live really weird fuckin version reality man. 

(Btw, article proves science right. Masks worked. lockdowns worked. didn't, numbers going down. people major cities Texas *still* wearing masks. Stop pretending facts related. article somehow prove nut job theory entire thing overblown global hoax meant annoy American conservatives. exact opposite. want ad hominem attacks stop, maybe consider cutting bad faith bullshit arguments ignore causality basic scientific principles us learned junior high.) generous came house unvaccinated live immunocompromised people bunch surplus masks drawer offer one wear. RemindME! 2 weeks ‚Äúguess covid cases didn‚Äôt increase‚Äù risk health, either Step one. Pifzer Vaccine, Freedom Shot. Moderna Vaccine, American Way Shot, J&amp;J vaccine, Liberty shot.

Step two. What? vaccinated? American! support Freedom, Liberty, American Way?

(FYI reference things done WWI, changing Hot Dogs names Freedom Dogs, removing German naming German things keep American buisness alive.) Gotta say ive pleasantly surprised Texas many places, including stores always enforcing.  I've never seen Safeway Whole Foods 91.6% effective

*If* legit vaccine, April, Slovakia's drug agency found batches manufactured Russia sub-standard could used. enough evidence claim getting covid makes immune. cases people getting 2 3 times.

This chicken pox. Throw dart literally anywhere western Washington  would know lived one Ohhhh okay, wait y'all got Safeway right? That's main grocery store area state, well whole foods. surprising, considering Murphy's ""data determines dates"" mantra. mask mandate getting renewed current form, CDC guidance came out.

After 15th, vaccinated people need mask. genuinely get coming from. Here's seem saying: ""Flu dangerous kids take precautions either Covid""

That's true either, way: COVID killed kids 1 year run Flu previous 3 years (during which, remind you, mask use common)

Flu deaths among kids recent years: 2017-18  188
* 2018-19  144
* 2019-20  198
* 2020-21  1

COVID-19 deaths among kids 2020-21  297 

How look numbers still believe Flu dangerous Covid children? take achieve level self-delusion?

I hope right fall we're back normal, way we'll get vaccinating everyone. get vaccine works kids 12, we've got today's rate spread going fall, would bet big money we'll see another year COVID kills flu. Gottlieb unusually correct throughout pandemic Grocery store  Stop it, ruining narrative. raised legitimate concerns day got blasted them. stroke forget wrote? I'll link comment again. Also call 911. Strokes potentially fuck Kroger? PNW btw, I've never hard place life. Hi guys guess time gonna come get covid shot, deff gonna wait long possible, (I already covid) I‚Äôm young extremely healthy, need mask come can‚Äôt longer,
Can schedule Johnson Johnson vaccine instead 2? I‚Äôm New York I‚Äôd rather one shot wait full month fully vax know everything else ending 15th right?

Like pre-covid one month real spread anymore...Seems pretty reasonable me. given vaccines poor countries first, done rich ones last everyone time. People need share. Hogging selfish. point society decide workers health lives less valuable individual‚Äôs right shop store? order delivery, curbside pickup. Nobody forced anyone go store. anything helpful add exactly boat sympathize you. major vaccine envy I'm pissed got first vaccine available instead waiting week two mRNA vaccine. trying hang onto fact Yankees outbreak 7/8 asymptomatic one symptomatic case mild.

Went high school graduation. Large, well ventilated auditorium local college. Signs door, text program ""masks required!"" 

I'm fully vaxed. couple months. husband, MIL &amp; Dad. trust vaccine. I've waiting fully vaxed change guidance. still wear one work (&amp; require customers so) local mandate. I've ready. fact, I'm traveling Mexico 1 week because...it's time &amp; I'm vaxed. 

I fully unprepared walk auditorium 300+ppl see maybe 25 masks. *know* people even partially, much less fully vaxed. think show 27% parish (county equivalent non-Louisiana ppl.)

Unless actually implying businesses going ""bouncers"" front doors checking everyone's vaccination record.

Pretty much everyone (within eligible groups) vaccinated point planning getting vaccinated probably anti-mask beginning. They've either gone maskless whole time worn one sake compliance we're giving excuse stop wearing one.  Yeah fuck guy's ""if get sick you"" attitude. top jerkoff sounds like expects medal bare minimum Glad able get vaccinated! I'm west coast everyone know vaxxed still masking - although groups rural areas tend anti-vaxx. 18? Yeah! Beat that! Heh That‚Äôs didn‚Äôt think steps needed taken first place. Statistically, auto accidents greater threat...*especially* case rates low continuing decline. again, science says vaccinated people dont need wear masks vaccinated people arent vector. Stop trying use scare tactics justify irrational logic.  Pretty much. judge rural-er city ruled mask mandates unconstitutional. Even still see many maskers driving wearing mask walking sidewalks wearing mask.  Love raw doggin air big thing remember. know lot people getting worked friends refuse ditch mask despite science saying, literally hurting anyone. last year traumatic many people. understand consistency jump back ""normal"" seeing many us spent last 12+ months extreme heightened amount anxiety. Jelly healthy 26 year old got horrific covid multiple clots lungs November, think risk future clots heightened? I‚Äôm slated go blood thinners weeks I‚Äôm nervous. Thanks!  gym never mask mandate. People underuse blocking features every social media app. wonder people skewing data around people returning second shot. Like mega site reporting person never came shot 2 person got shot 2 CVS. Im curious much sites talking sharing info. maybe US reopened bit (actually lot) quickly compared countries even higher rates vaccination like UK Israel. no, need 100% capacity, maskless, indoor events pandemic's now. People 18 general virtually zero risk without vaccine. still contract transmit, major deal unless underlying condition pits risk.  Good... really hope summer even five months move Covid . really hate uncertainty. want go back simple days life Thank u perfect Meijer lifted mandate today. going available til 2023 though...wonder area single cop wore mask lockdowns after. would hate cop shows wearing mask kick someone want wear mask. guess that's police eventually stated enforcing it. home? that's transmissions happen.

I'm fully vaccinated partner end week, seems incredibly fast. searching time vaccine felt like barely got time. 2 3 weeks would big improvement. like 40 percent vaccinated nation wide?? Absolutely bonkers considering messaging 70+ got throughout year. 

Remind 2 weeks check hospitalization rates lmao ugh went ER without needing to. visiting friend. something else wrong coincidentally also COVID. maybe something think of.  work Target. accurate mine (in Florida real mask laws whatever store could ignore us couldn‚Äôt anything) dumbdumbs Also unmasked unvaccinated people walking around makes people can‚Äôt get vaccinated greater risk. huge portion population that‚Äôs young get vaccinated today Walmart SA 100% mask compliance. guess mileage may vary. Twice blessed!  dad immunocompromised, worry  mom teacher 2 classrooms shut kids came carriers got teachers sick. want everyone understand kids seem get ""sick"" mean fucking things everyone else, ignorant parents would rather send school make sure carriers absolute assholes. still mess, selfishness ""man"" seems shine ever brighter. heard NPR today USA 60% vaccinated. That‚Äôs 20m doses given away countries end June. CDC full shit worse useless 328.2 million people U.S. think everyone stay distanced masked 16k cases yesterday calling dummy? Lmao Oh local rules  Yea sorry don‚Äôt believe you. happen, it‚Äôs one cases COVID strongly affected kid. 

Flu similar severity levels, terms kid deaths also terms non-fatal symptoms, one expected workd wear masks two years ago. testing MERS vaccine Covid broke out. also several SARS vaccines works, [funding dried didn‚Äôt turn huge reason didn‚Äôt coronavirus vaccine approved already, usually takes long get vaccine ) don‚Äôt much profit margin companies careful spend much anything might pan out, everything takes longer. also usually takes long time enough people get infected prove efficacy, stage goes much quicker pandemic. 

We got vaccines quick many governments turned money shower guaranteed cover companies costs even product failed. don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs ever many people companies working goal getting vaccine stop pandemic. There‚Äòs well hundred Covid vaccines developed, approved use far. Congrats partner still wait til end week searching endlessly vaccine availability. 

2 fucking weeks would saved thousands lives. stupid honestly. don‚Äôt catch car accident merely breathing room somebody else. Avoiding car accidents something well mitigated behavior. Can‚Äôt say COVID.

Also, driving touchy topic kids. absolutely let dad drive kids, instance. Imagine Ohio used money buy vaccines countries can't afford vaccine. Situations like happening right India could minimized; instead money blown Buckeye gotten vaccine without bribed.  OK shopping there. Anyone else hoping masks become normal now? know lot people vaccine I‚Äôd love become norm mask sick flu season. getting sick past year nice Ontario Canada plenty morons dumb shit make covid worse.

But public places anywhere greater Toronto area would 100% call cops every time. won‚Äôt see one person store maskless anywhere go groceries anything else. beginning anti maskers going nuts avoid consistently got people pulled stores police long enough never see anymore except occasional jackass pulls nose. think alarmist lot people respect would agree knows really? We'll wait see plays out. kind exciting watch unfold also excruciatingly slow boring wait unfold. need make Forest Gump type movie part history. summarize capture zeitgeist covid years telling unrelated story. hopeful would start see updates this! incentive interested tracking understand point‚Ä¶and convo lot friends family trying convince get vaccinated, especially high risk. biggest rebuttals include:
1. Lack FDA-approval
2. Extensive push bribes ppl vaccinated 
3. Big Pharma corruption like phizer, moderna
4. Lack long term vaccine study
My mindset push anything maintain clear science based debate. 
Automatically pinning anti vax doesn‚Äôt help, take offense discussion over. advise tips welcome! meijers dropped know side affects vaccines others simply speed scale initial deployment. Multi year studies long term side affects, study sizes small recognize maybe even experience incredibly rare things, long protection lasts, really matter getting another shot year. concern comes place lack understanding. Youre crazy. Youre safe parent. hard know thw right thing is. won‚Äôt lose sleep deaths anti-vaxxers. makes bad person
So think huge part big thirst vaccines long lockdowns places like Ontario. still stay home order virtually nothing open/happening, it‚Äôs like majority past year. 

People want end soon possible go beer patio. feel like much America flippant restrictions long people fence vaccines see real change manifested therefore don‚Äôt care get it. don‚Äôt. Idk fuck get numbers US least, early Feb 2020 public consciousness really yet. last time flew birthday *end* February last year hundreds (hell maybe thousands) people saw airports, like two wearing mask.

*Early* February people might even known anything even going around all, certainly would stood like sore thumb wearing mask. see, makes ""other""

Keep group think we'll find dumbass really is.  Pennsyltucky, I'm really surprised tbh intense pushback start masks. family got vaccine though, thing control thus worry about. sucks know anti-vaxxers good people misled, much do. Karma called said way. PISSED. I‚Äôm still wearing mask places even though I‚Äôm vaccinated, besides people wearing anyway don‚Äôt want dirty looks kind kid makes afraid kids they're destined loser *shudder* We're monkeys.  anti-vaxxers fucked mentality beginning.


If get sick, me, get sick, you.

I can't anything stop getting sick, stop getting sick, get choose measures take insure health. really works. People see 94% think 'each person 94% chance get sick', really 'in population, 94% people get sick'.

More precisely, means odds getting COVID reduced 94% baseline odds getting got vaccine. 100% population gotten COVID, even close. If, sake argument, assume baseline chance catching COVID 1% living life pandemic without vaccinated, means 0.006% chance getting COVID vaccinated. Yes! Same! lung scarring reduced capacity already though think plays it. never wear one exercising outside long matter hard tried (and always alone anyway). problem people lying many things effect. cited one immunocomprimised people can't get vaccine risk. true honestly one least worrying concerns.

Every time virus infects new person chance mutation, virus mutate another strain people lying vaccinated catching it, possible get strain vaccine resistant. Actually scary part virus spread, ones make ones able infect vaccinated people higher rate variants slowly die off. would evolution happen given enough time people virus continues thrive places like US India.

The last part vaccinated gives something like 96% immunity, problem yet know long exactly immunity lasts. virus current form able spread among unvaccinated non mask wearing population foreseeable future real threat begin infecting vaccinated population later line immunization begins wear off. crazy trying suggest animosity towards China. 

I didn't. said extra precautions animosity. plan SARS install temperature scanning passengers, removed airports ever since.

That's everyone everywhere now. What's security airports tightened everything else ran usual past year, despite countries Malaysia Vietnam picking positive cases Taiwan multiple times. 

I know trying say prove. case, investigations reports made public. Possible infections airports. Either way, every port entry best. Taiwan gets infected passengers Vietnam Malaysia elsewhere see complaining that? always 'we made screening test close contact, found infections', everyone knows that's bullshit given nature disease.

Yo, public health expert... show that's narrative? point always containment without jeopardizing health system economy. contact tracing given high tried keep successful facade get seat WHA, didn't, said stuff finally started testing. That's seeing now.

Your faulty reasoning results faulty conclusions. trying justify China's block health contributors name politics simply middle-school grade. parent someone moved 17 wierd hear 19 year old still parents tell do. pre-existing condition would qualify group 3, luck. Recently AZ shots opened Romania everyone, wife's family lives there. made 1650km drive one go get shots. least able to.

Few days go back second. able go out, surety stand good chance it. wish easier get shot right now. arm sore next day so

You mean like someone hits arm hammer? wild lmao Connecticut Massachusetts lifting thiers well. listened interview, say exactly. said n95 necessary normal mask usage technically correct since goal masks prevent spread person know sick.

Again technically correct really bad statement. quoting wiki article. Note similar ACLJ looks ACLU. deliberate misdirection. It‚Äôs downhill that. Hit arm hammer? It‚Äôs momentary pinch, 3 seconds later you‚Äôre done, talking about? arm sore next day shot trivial. Yeah, grocery store worked kinda stopped one employees assaulted telling customer mask up. tell store director incident saw someone without mask. can‚Äôt everywhere once. Also amount people threatened wait outside employees told mask insane well. stop wearing mask work ? don‚Äôt want medal, maybe slight decrease elitist, whiny, holier though condescension.

Congratulations, let people die could send vaccines countries needed less. get medal stupidity. Uh like 6 people. millions. 

You people terrible long term effects memes. Know actually terrible long term effects? Covid. Um.. check profile get answer I‚Äôm going target! Walmart suck it! suck.......at hockey! 

Wicked burn.  note, even though J&amp;J single shot take weeks reach full efficacy. Yeah, honor system joke. announced nobody needs wear masks social distance there's practical way tell vaccinated aren't. I'm sorry misunderstood nature vaccine, I'm surprised there're people like her. job determine normality everyone.

Some ready party, others hesitant, remaining never cared. Save us USA save us! trusting pediatrician public health professionals pandemic info. 

Which ridiculous. Lol. Enjoy red dead dude :) telling Texas Rangers showing shooting Covid, death reported resisting arrest instead Covid death.

&amp;#x200B;

/s There's not, that's always option anyone wants to. longer mandatory. science support meaningful improvement time. That‚Äôs takes decade longer study. Things need TIME. cannot rush anything. leads big problems. It‚Äôs like dating. rush relationship usually suffer major repercussions. 

The drop could coincidental. wait winter see resurfaces. way worded makes sound like Kroger multiple states. easy really work way. told friends socializing person us fully vaccinated. comment public health, health commenter‚Äôs kids particular. I'm sure getting voted. never said that. didn‚Äôt look up, remember reading (no, Facebook feed) booster works while. Thank Target, cool! dude standing front Target went enforcing it. many Walmart except rural exurban areas, idea did. We‚Äôre behind second doses. US mostly fully vaccinated vaccinated. Sweet! Appreciate man. definitely check one places instead [lol üòÜ  last guy knew early december virus much worse anyone expected kept screeching side demonizing him.... I've seen plenty 18 year olds get sick covid-19. mild yo moderate symptoms, give good reality check. longer think invincible much seriously. absolutely enabler. 

Oh they‚Äôre enabling people get vaccines want, someone call FBI! Tell cut ties get it. heads up, children 2 cannot wear masks due possible suffocation. It‚Äôs aren‚Äôt ‚Äúrecommended‚Äù, considered absolutely no-go medical standpoint. must gotten law degree Bing read comments you‚Äôre replying to? They‚Äôre talking people wanting still able get it, people don‚Äôt believe vaccines. üëç k Hey, least us healthy paranoia. I'm California, pre-vaccine, wore respirator indoors.

I'll tempted wear one next time fly. mean can't contract virus spread anymore. would still helpful, though necessary guess. absolutely factor. low numbers we're seeing due antibodies, however obtained. 

A reminder cost antibodies: fifty thousands Texans dead. Even Texas performed well Canada, exactly great locking following guidelines, 25,000 dead loved ones still alive. 

Fuck anyone pushes anti-lockdown message result numbers. Jfc.  wear mask Ya, I'm couple hours south two boarder IL/IA. pretty compliant IL side(~80%) metro area, rural areas ~60%. Iowa side probably ~75% metro ~40% rural areas. CDC bowed pressure. 

So stop bitching. know sound eager open things partly selfishness even though I'm introvert. summer coming lot friends family work entertainment, food service. They've absolutely fucking devastated restrictions they're damn happy booking events getting job offers again.

Again I'm sorry situation hope understand full selfishness people wanting pretend over. Even though probably majority. Canadian, that. global effort we're historical bros side side issues world, virus knows borders.

It must fought together claim victory.  point open everything vaccinated peopel first. everyone else run get vaccine.
It's simple, vaccine go back normal. not, quarantine wear masks forever.

Let people choose first step government opening everything back normal vaccinated people proof vaccination. Isnt amazing absolutely nothing changed suddenly dont need masks anymore? like magic! üôÑ duh 80% Menards

Weird, Menards closest would refuse let people wearing mask. suppose people could've taken store, remember seeing anyone that. Fuck yeah! two weeks ago. One day we'll able give real high fives.

And I'm happy we're starting data showing delayed second/booster shot increase immune system response yielding greater immunization.

Our strategy paying first shot already lot help ease stress doctors nurses face. remember DeSantis put whistleblower jail trying report accurate Covid numbers?

You're date state ""whistleblower"" you? case of, belief deliberate, criminal conspiracy need addressed pursued time as, virological inquiry investigation done. thrilling see China new leader world. Show bit least concern immunocompromised - group sub claimed cared last year - get downvoted hell. Wear mask forever, that‚Äôs accepted solution. shut *need* go concert Applebee‚Äôs, fuck concerns! Ditto Northwest Suburbs. would dare say 98%.  Even Ikea (though never went in, picked outside, once.). That's I'll continue shop instead Walmart Target now. way knowing who's legit vaccinated people lie. Yes, think better alternative would CDC added grocery stores essential shopping exceptions rule, like public transit. People can't really avoid grocery shopping (esp. can't afford delivery) public transit. 

People avoid things like indoor dining, bars, sporting events, etc. open back instead would already significant re-opening incentive get vaccinated. friend, I‚Äôm playing red dead redemption 2. could care less lol. Maybe you‚Äôll get‚Äôem next time brah üçª  sum up: fibromyalgia, neuropathy, syringomyelia, polymorphic light eruption, vestibular balance disorder, lupus symptoms, ms symptoms, demyelination brain, convergence insufficiency (think sort like seizures quite), drop falls (think almost passing unconscious), chronic illnesses overarching autoimmune disorder team specialists still able identify past eight years. 

For immunocompromised people, doctor(s) recommend vaccine. Basically, don‚Äôt (none 4-5 team have), can‚Äôt get proven wreak havoc already jacked system. I'm going vacation, I'd almost want pay fly masked people catch sniffles flight. Even long COVID ends.

I seem get sick third time I'm airplane.

Since masks primarily protecting others, choosing airline requires means safe passengers' coughing, sneezing little brats.

Come think it, adults-only airline might pleasant, too. fully vaccinated also mean received one shot two-shot vaccine haven‚Äôt waited two weeks final shot yet mean, around 64 million parents kids 18 US, sure, I‚Äôm sure average American rarely reacts kids lol. Wow. I‚Äôm shocked corps moving fast hell yes. Lotta ugly mugs sub must explanation whining. Necessary evil. Anyone voted sit-on-hands government taxes raised compensate everyone whose livelihoods put hold vaccine inaction. 

Elections consequences that. hard feeling bruh :) SE suburban-rural WI - 40% people local Walmart wearing masks. 75% Meijer, probably 90+% Target. Additionally, 60% Home Depot, 80% Menards, maybe 10% Fleet Farm last visits. bipolar sub think I‚Äôve ever seen. opinion article, news. 

The arguments writers made ridiculous well. Garbage article. Yeah well I‚Äôve really shitty luck lately. live target big burly security guards right door either telling leave put mask. 

Very noses sticking well chicken fish? Fucking finally not. definitely bias happening sub bot set actual mods. Sad people cant even ask questions anything without stating feel way without violating politics rules. Yeah, perhaps. figured, well, Parker. Tiny rant - fucking tired people correlating everyone happy never wear mask anti-Vaxxers. 

I‚Äôve hated masks since day 1. I‚Äôve worn required - I‚Äôm going cause scene Trader Joe‚Äôs. (I also covid tests anyone know last year media, multiple times month.)

I got vaccine soon possibly could. I‚Äôm wearing anymore. We're vaccinating ~1 million/week now.

Sorry friend, even kept 700,000 doses would sped pace. 100k People today number: Ontario 14.71. Qu√©bec : 6.43.

Walmart, least local one, ever enforce it. local Walmart pretty bad though. That's admin handled mask mandate question better hey know.... feels like mix know problem airplane airport (my main airport LAX, probably airport me), often get sick long flight.

It's easy blame airplanes air feels awful onboard, hey, I'll play safe places. Plus, I'm Asian, people even think looks weird wear mask.

One problems long flights getting cold, masks help keep face warm anyway.

I'm vaccinated worried virus I'm exercising outside days (I'm outdoors nowhere near anyone husband), wear mask allergies warmth. Worth it. say was?

Even catch vaccinated chances symptomatic case transmitted almost nil  committee decide. said would based case counts need probably Central America, Southest Asia, etc Shocker. better educated less conspiracy laden US currently. Necessary evil heavy-handed policy? Bet ya dreamt one Actually research shows combining different vaccines tends result side effects patients. Costco Minnesota Sunday, signs saying masks required fully-vaccinated individuals, I'd say 9 10 people still wore mask (even though area 55%+ adults two shots). IMO social pressure going remain bit longer certain areas (a weeks, I'd say), many people gotten used keep requirement ubiquitously dropped. even exclusively China's fault. US government funding gain function experiments...

It isn‚Äôt. Expecting vaccinated people wear one is. I'm pretty sure Scott intelligent enough understand bit, think? He's obviously talking general population. says risk low zero.

There also risk benifit analysis. know vaccinated 3 months would even risk getting covid third scenario need know too

The report covered. Imported frozen seafood one potential source. US military bringing China participation October 2019 Military World Games Wuhan another potential source. ""Multiple origins"" another potential source.

Granted, younger population groups I'm sure takeup lower COVID seen less threat, anyway think demand peter much later US. wanted vaccines last five months.  spitting spray droplets surroundings speaking / heavy breathing. (Some people visibly).

You need hit eyes (they tear ducts; wearing glasses reduce chance infected)) general vicinity mouth/nose minute someone scratches nose.

Off cause keep distance good, people complain allowed **to jog crowded paths** without mask. comparing density city urban area whole NZ. outbreaks August February South Auckland, densely populated urban area country.

My bad. Apples apples then.

Auckland population density: 2,400/km2 

Taipei population density: make sound like Taiwan fewer resources NZ, can't level testing. two countries similar level wealth. There's reason Taiwan limiting testing generally using large numbers possible outbreak.

Guess I'll die then. usually, tired people like lol No. Mask requirement matched CDC day CDC requirement. Businesses PA free set requirements now. I'm sorry, people yet offered vaccine--the majority people 40--people without brain? free deny information? 60% adults, 48% total population receive funding proportional vaccination rates insurance companies raise rates policyholders get vaccination anything medical reasons. I'm tired paying states individuals oppositionally defiant cost lives. time break stick.  low key? 60% ADULTS. 48% total population. would actually go get vaccinated available me. relying honor system wearing masks bound fail. love middle ground know. mitigate risk limiting exposure Proper precautions. completely shutting off. also don‚Äôt need run willy-nilly sort getting comments. 

 big thing many dangerous things thinking even medically related even socially. Probably tons things likely kill children one really thinks about. problem, neatly explained FoldedTwice UK sub, levels old variant still going down. disguises far levels new variant going up.

Which means new variant R 1, going continue rise outcompeted prior variant.

In two weeks may find absolutely fine. may find another period uncontrolled rise. Modeling shows we're *quite* vaccination yet enough support massive surge cases (the majority deaths older people, hospital admissions little spread out). smart people charge least consider options. Unless would rather ignore problems going forward? words, water wet.

Would nice indirectly pay stupidity people certainly take health resources even get sick even want vaccine People vaccinating three, four five times 1, 2, 3... How? masks used never restricted airflow all. Plus, asthma caused several things, get exercise, stress, lot people allergies something. mask helps keep allergies airway lungs. states I‚Äôm 33 keep telling people I‚Äôm 31. accident. keep forgetting. Article says Pfizer aiming September. already lottery dying. happened? Earlier pandemic seemed like Japan well.

Aside couple family kooks I'd rather dwell everyone know either vaccinated soon be. relief, say. one thing right I'd feel smidge less misanthropic. Swimmers risk getting wet, C.D.C Director Says. Yes I‚Äôve never heard someone refusing take child car avoid car accident. live risk mitigate using safety precautions like car seats. Covid definitely see leaving children home taking ever? Seems like probably setting risky diseases later on.  Keeping children 6 feet away people pretty easy one depending go. would precaution that‚Äôs doable average grocery store.

You mitigated own. children likely around stranger 15 minutes close proximity let them? Awesome. I'll get mine tomorrow china wants cock-block investigation let publicly. wish didn‚Äôt right hesitant.

I‚Äôd declared state emergency forced vaccines arms. someone wants conscientiously object could put money mouth cool heels jail contempt. immunosuppressive therapy saved going blind and/or paralysed due multiple sclerosis stopped body producing antibodies, even though far apart treatment possible ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 20-year-olds responsible 70-year-olds? getting numbers from? US reached 200 million first shot end april, population 330 million latest census. That's 60%, we've stopped giving first shots, though slowed down. article says 40%. Seems like either fake clickbait propaganda. easier unvaxed island? that's goal right? get rid anyone else? I'm 33, got last dose 2 weeks ago. signed moment eligible LA county took general age 50+ 16+...and I'm still week away peak immunity 2 weeks second dose.

I completely get I'd we're seeing high enough numbers yet, barely happened 3 weeks ago   Oh definitely both. half measures.  vaccine stop spread covid. Last checked CDC said potentially slowed spread looking it. Vaccines reduce mortality nasty side effects.  Los Angeles. opened 50 April 15th, 4 weeks ago. 

So even one first ones get first dose day, you‚Äôre still full vaccinated Pfizer Moderna shot. Quebec half population quarter daily cases around half rate per 100k Ontario.  necessarily? Maybe getting vaccine first better? Maybe doesn‚Äôt matter? Spread wise isn‚Äôt better, although I‚Äôm guessing elderly want vaccine now.  happened science. mask wearing Democrat would pissed. refuse apply critical thinking situation in, instead rely people's unwillingness put risk behavior? considerate. Target sure did. scary looking dudes masks hand sanitizer entrance, didn‚Äôt fuck around. Honestly anyone else want let people keep up. Let wear badge stupidity. extra measures may taken keep kids safe there's vaccine them.

And aren't, never going fully eradicate COVID...why still talking that? opportunity gone soon shit got Wuhan. appreciate post info masks. Still, seems like lot work lot money. choice have? think agree lot maybe we're miscommunicating. think vaccinated individuals need continue mask outdoors sort private setting indoors outdoors. 

As health this? I'm solid organ transplant patient March 2020 got flu shot year never got sick outside rare cold would last week longer normal.

Thank listening anyway understanding. Good luck you. *know* that. report yesterday.

Monday numbers mean much *because reporting weekend weekend*--the state accepting reports weekend anymore. Therefore, Monday numbers really *count* anything. *Tuesday* numbers higher, include Saturday, Sunday, Monday. 

We got 0 COVID deaths any, stupid accounting trick count died *today*. Yeah I'd wait well problem waiting another week two vaccine ? don‚Äôt schedule first second dose place. students get first dose college second one home. extra Covid sick leave, guess mandated voluntary federal tax incentive various state laws. likely employer likely participates, probably check HR.

See:  Me, someone who's fully vaccinated, screwing anyone dropping mask (I there's local mandate).

The plan never keep every single person protected way. immune compromised always live carefully rest us, that's new, huge part adult population. yes sucks kids still mask vaccines coming, there's way we're masking another year spread near nothing vaccine kids.

I saw someone today saying infant can't get vaccine need mask....an infant likely ever protected this.

This pretty pro-science decision CDC fact taking social stuff account...if looking science, nothing else, CDC right: vaccinated people need masks. I'm happy high demand seen far Canada. Hoping demand stays high next month get high % adults high school kids. ready take dump floor throw tantrum let in. wish seen interim steps people like able willing go socialize, without making people like worry getting groceries prescriptions. Don‚Äôt disagree vaccinated adult risk loved ones able more! wish could kept essential locations masked little longer. EU repeatedly called US export ban.

Last time response Biden's bullshit plan waive patents. don‚Äôt see you‚Äôre making point me, you? precautions work influenza work COVID-19. conditions, Covid killed nearly 300 times kids. claim flu dangerous kids straight face? vaccination level low there? seems remarkably behind pace one would expect. 3rd wave coming soon‚Ä¶ honor system going work. think results poll tell us *don't* need coerce people vaccine. Enough people want get accord, trying force might piss people off. first time reported mod or.. worked. Yeah went Ikea yesterday, enforcing masks door inside maybe 1/20 people masked up. usual bunch people Ikea. good news still largely see people *complying* orders, even CDC's announcements. 

I physically superspreader event two weeks ago, I'm vaccinated, know none children were, know definitely cranks least one family showed *symptomatic*, causing superspreader event.  everyone vaccine fine. vaccines 100%.

I HATE take, gnores fully vaccinated people hurt. Looks like I‚Äôm sticking meijer :/ Home Depot hiring 11?! Yikes!  BioNTech all. Marburg plant keeps chugging doses like nothing. vaccines designed give 100% immunity. That's possible. However they've shown highly effective protecting get vaxxed. eliminate hospitalizations death happen catch it. get covid vaccination viral load low essentially low grade version virus. area different. lifestyle still majorly constrained proof pretty obvious me, may experience you. mask mandate lifted going profoundly positive impact people like me, without doubt. 

I'm happy it, really tremendous relief. I've done part CDC made calculation worthwhile. know unmasked also unvaxxed‚Ä¶ Long term effects. Ironic considering vaccines recall getting life, barely even felt anything one. felt like tiny bit pressure me, pain jab here. think case healthcare capacity, rather raw figures mortality, determines threshold imposing restrictions people. healthcare system can't cope, creates nonlinear effect would lead far dying things might treatable, capacity taken sick patients - course sick patients unable secure medical care, we've seen India.

However, one concern raised UK prospect restrictions reimposed every winter seasonal pressures, years severe. Previous March 2020, idea imposing restrictions individuals businesses prevent happening would even occurred anyone. Now, standard practice, indeed NHS officials incentivised demand action rather increase capacity themselves, government sort longstanding structural problems health service. status quo bias, burden proof shifted onto trying justify restrictions, opposed speaking favour measures. Therefore, might easily flip script question ask favour restrictions criteria risk tolerance lifting them. State hotline here, go ahead make doctor, they're vaccinated. Stay away nurses though, unless confirm vaccinated. Thanks calling! I'm religious, old joke sums sort mindset pretty fellow stuck rooftop flood. praying God help. 
Soon man rowboat came fellow shouted man roof, ""Jump in, save you."" 
The stranded fellow shouted back, ""No, OK, I'm praying God going save me."" 
So rowboat went on. 
Then motorboat came by. ""The fellow motorboat shouted, ""Jump in, save you."" 
To stranded man said, ""No thanks, I'm praying God going save me. faith."" 
So motorboat went on. 
Then helicopter came pilot shouted down, ""Grab rope lift safety."" 
To stranded man replied, ""No thanks, I'm praying God going save me. faith."" 
So helicopter reluctantly flew away. 
Soon water rose rooftop man drowned. went Heaven. finally got chance discuss whole situation God, point exclaimed, ""I faith save me, let drown. understand why!"" 
To God replied, ""I sent rowboat motorboat helicopter, expect?"" he's politician scientist. want people start panicking still potentially risk COVID, even technically are. Whether Biden accepts Indian variant exists irrelevant, spread American become dominant, like currently Europe. job explain science people, maintain popularity make people feel safe simplifying complicated concepts. America's biggest issue vaccine hesitancy. good idea convince people take vaccine saying vaccines perfect. Sometimes tell white lie. Finally! fakeness go places now. Let choke. Seems like horrible way go, point they've decided really want live Vegas lifestyle COVID. Yeah. get CDC wants announcements scientifically accurate possible, seems ignore people insert assumptions whatever say. amount nuance leaves far much room people that. Clever. Bet you‚Äôve thinking one whole life. course picture frames great way idiots society identify rest us! can't read adblocker, people study exposed unmasked, unvaccinated people?

Certainly there's written guarantee things change worse. day sure vaccinated move on. now, vaccines work. reject ones worry.

Of course doesn't, people almost never rational nature. ""Mostly works"" decent enough reason many mixed messages required wear mask

Where to/not wear mask matters less less every day people get vaccinated. encourages 5% undecided people get vaccinated, that's massive win unmasking people never believed going use excuse go unmasked

Vaccinated airport workers also transmitted general population causing new outbreak lockdown Singapore. got options, every grocery store area announced they're removing mask requirements.

Side note: skyline chili really worth hype.. people want live fear think that's CDC's interest, shortsighted. accepting certain variants lower overall efficacy vaccine, acting like outside realm possibility new variant severe vaccinated? end day, they're responsible guidance third populous country world, one already pretty shaky comes pandemic response guideline adoption. Right they're making impossible businesses enforce mask requirements, paving way full ""back normal"" start school year ~3 months, daily new cases daily deaths basically big surge last fall. We're close finish line want blow face. 


I can't remember exact numbers top head, conflicting numbers comes preventing hospitalization death depending country study performed variant question. Choosingbeggars much? Well it‚Äôs probably late, person history DVT/pe would recommend Johnson vaccine? 

(I since gotten Pfizer doses ‚Äî mostly curious.)

Thank you. So, Biden going lift export restrictions raw material?

That's far important IMHO. Hillsboro? Good them. makes feel safer power them. They're minor annoyance, never really cared much start wearing them. Though fair, woodworking hobby mine already used wearing mask long hours weekend. 

I'm necessarily going wearing time future, feel little sick there's bug going around? Sure. I've got small stack now, might well make use them. entirely different. live Austin proper, even within past week, seen anybody without mask HEB store. Go 45 minutes direction probably see fewer 30% people mask, maybe even lower depending small town is. Theres plenty HVAC contractors, work large one, problem upgrades taking money is. money new installs upgrades, also what's ""HVAC designer""? Fucking kids man. Haha ""And news, water wet""

Aka shit  Good me. Good causes lose upset. I'll upset think huge slowdown donation lol I'm changing anything. saying cases go up. provided sources say that. 

You've got cases went mask mandate TX went without one. anything, indicates opposite claiming. Same. went target today people masked. Cool. I'm fully vaccinated I'm still going wear mask Target. hoping that's case! clear timeline - Pfizer plans finish application end May apply expedited (6-month) review, would put decision around December unless FDA decides move faster, might. Moderna close behind. I'm sure J&amp;J timeline, vaccines countries regulatory bodies, much regulatory bodies accelerate review process circumstances, least point enough data file vaccines.

It's pretty interesting reading vaccine development history - lot vaccine mechanisms use already realized (including ones target organisms - tetanus vaccine provokes immune response pseudotoxin similar real toxin produced bacterial infection). certainly legitimate reasons people get one type vaccine another, that's option.

Some info application/review process Pfizer vaccine: whether prepared abide restrictions liberty, vaccine, stop hospitals filled people chosen take it. think straight choice vaccine passports mandates, allowing minority keep society closed exercising right refuse vaccine, foregone conclusion - even if, like me, see vaccine passports unnecessary time vehemently opposed them.  sheer stupidity people following science

You mean science says masks dropped, due vaccine? Besides, kids literally lowest level risk anybody. makes sense lift restrictions first. reason risk transmission. 

At point, everyone high risk wants vaccine probably gotten it, therefore risk transmission mitigated. Lift restrictions let children live normally. fair - simply believing beliefs - sort picking fight people. holding book full misogyny, homophobia, slavery, sexual abuse, physical abuse - saying oh hey ‚Äòthis me‚Äô‚Ä¶ smug fuck. It‚Äôs unreasonable burden make underpaid unappreciated workers ensure idiots comply public health regulations. wrong that? Religious constitutional freedoms protected. take Illinois Lucky, area rather conservative it‚Äôs battle  Haha don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll making vaccine attendants yeah you‚Äôre probably right wanting healthy immune system give chance erradicate covid vax resistent strain shows we're back square one (say goodbye already struggling economy). seen what's happening India? 4 year old got RSV 7 weeks. winter baby tried best avoid visitors make sure everyone washing hands, somehow got anyway. Luckily mild case, went ER night observation spiking fever turned corner kept improving. long term damage, got easy.

All said, BRUTAL watching newborn miserable, unable eat, struggling breathe, coughing like old man. worried case going one better outcomes.

Having MILDEST VERSION watching baby suffer, never want avoid it. There's vaccine RSV (there preventative treatments usually reserved NICU babies babies higher risk factors.) 

But vaccine Covid. keep best reduce risks 4 6 year olds vaccinated I'll goddamned helplessly watch kid struggle breathe ER something could easily avoided little extra caution.

Some people never terrified children's health shows. GOOD I'm still scarred RSV experience. enough me, thanks.  saw tweet posted ended covid way ended Vietnam war. got expensive pretend it‚Äôs over. japan went incompetent straight immoral.

It's one thing horde vaccines using another thing horde vaccines sit around absolutely nothing.

If japanese anti-vaxx government smart enough rollout plan, least sell country going use them?

I can't tell japan's xenophobia apathy that's preventing obvious. looks it, really olympics that's literally think about. It‚Äôs pisstake fact sending kids back like 2 weeks left seems pointless. need permit everything lol

‚Äúsorry, need permit take mask‚Äù There‚Äôs thing full immunity. Tons symptomatic cases Asia right Pfizer doses months ago. known effective variations. open churches 200% capacity.

Then watch vaccinated per capita skyrocket üòè mean, like go ahead. going get much judgement post covid, saying kind problem using them, saying WE.

A lot us want mask covid, make us anti-maskers, see need to. CDC say that? true extent. Give platform people spread things like virus, simile intended. family friend fully vaccinated COVID right still isnt 100% I'm fence this. fully vaccinated since January, kept usual precautions even though knew day coming. probably still mask little longer vaccination rate gets area school fully over.

But admit get people saying masking time, every flu season, kids get sick. know works elsewhere see younger kids wearing masks school voluntarily. struggle is, reason worked well school every single kid it, exceptions. soon one kid it, bets off. Older kids teens, maybe? grade schoolers. that's germs get house anyway. masking going stop getting everything kid brings home. mask work sure, everyone time sick might be, work. Good want to, think there's false sense much masks really verses precautions combined masks. also distancing going places making sure everyone household, everyone around you, same, much mask going you?

I look forward future study proving wrong maybe bringing real change.

I await mass downvotes.  meant flu.  mean group said need mask children significant risk covid 19?  Read comments. kid hospital 10 days covid variant. lung damage. 

What people thinking way kid harmed covid... die? weird. don‚Äôt 100% know. information seems positive vaccines early days. Infections mid November led high death rates January, could early stages, new wave. said seems not.

The issue significant proportion population yet vaccinated (under 40s) still don‚Äôt know much long Covid, also ending hospital isn‚Äôt fun.

For transmission worrying bit increases vaccination level herd immunity increases. original Covid may R number low R2.5, vaccination level 60%. UK variant may 70% transmittable, r4.25 means levels 74%. Another 50% top, r6.4 (ish) = 85% required. figures approximate. hear you, something similar. went back, filtered bad, insane negative. get enjoy cats, family silly memes! Bu-bu-bu-but wanna keep screaming people wearing masks. pump brakes ending pandemic thing? wierd different places be. live KC havent seen unmasked person store probably year including today orders lifted. so? 300 kids died covid 30 million confirmed cases. right, sorry. thought using Chinese one remembered article they'd received bunch. Apparently, health ministry approved it.

We may need watch singapore different result USA.  Banks pretty anti ‚Äúcover face anything‚Äù significant risk covid. Good. Hopefully later. Yep, live KC havent seen unmasked person store months, maybe even year. There‚Äôs lower efficacy contracting COVID, evidence vaccines less effective preventing severe death disease COVID variants? That‚Äôs CDC interested in, since they‚Äôre creating guidance macro level.  I‚Äôll leave luck america. You‚Äôre gonna need it. Adults get vaccine cannot even recall last time saw someone store masked. live Kansas City. Pretty much every place enforcing rules someone near door. Even today everyone masked went. Vaccines eliminate hospitalisations, simply alter probabilities. Hypothetically (these random made numbers) let's say pre vaccination 1 hospitalisation per 100 cases. post vaccination 1 hospitalisation per 500 cases. However, number cases spikes everything goes back normal, surge hospitalisations could potentially match past spikes. Given Indian variant likely become dominant next weeks months across world, we're seeing UK, transmissible variant added mix, cut unvaccinated communities far quicker UK variant. Since vaccines perfect, 95% protection hospitalisation according Public Health England's surveillance data, huge spread cases vaccinated cause significant hospitalisations. Even cases required reach certain number hospitalisations (due vaccines increasing people's probability safety), big enough spike, due new highly transmissible variant, could cause similar spikes hospitalisations future. Nothings' certain, there's still significant risk long there's lot global transmission and, society, enough collective immunity, infection vaccination. 1) covid vaccines we're using mrna vaccines, and
2) mrna vaccines less likely rendered ineffective mutation, outside realm possibility.

Our best bet avoid trouble mutations limit number times virus permitted mutate, means many vaccinations possible also stopping spread among groups cannot vaccinated. mechanism different, way builds immunity body basically same. 


The mRNA vaccine trains body defend spike protein like traditional vaccine would, direct effective way. 

If/when there's significant enough mutation spike protein, vaccine less effective. Getting second shot next week!! Masks crowded places go long way, learned thst hardway.  Adult athsma, allergic pollens dandruff, cancer survivor, epileptic entire life diagnosed past years (it comes slightly fucked immune system meds learned favors department). sick (outside illnesses caused diagnosed disorder) year. never happened before. 

I personally loved continue wear masks cant distance seems american cultural ""thing"" get right behind people lines seems broken little bit.

Side note. absolutley love personal space world large. made public much enjoyable experience. not? Well said!

Icky, good analogy. saw enforced both. always someone entrance enforcing saw people kicked offered mask. This‚Äôll get ppl take knowing govt hasn‚Äôt made mandatory places value made mandatory Can‚Äôt wear mask? need delivered. now. dont see browsing walking throughout store worth getting others sick You‚Äôll see lot uptake colleges done.

Getting first dose driving back college second scheduling second dose appointment across state lines stupid. 

And side effects pretty big second dose. Nobody right mind getting upon launch second dose could finals. area Walmart enforced masks limited amount people store. guys entrance exits counting people.  Ah yes honor system anti-Vaxers definitely won‚Äôt wear mask. Fucking idiocy. idea I'm getting downvotes. think obtuse illogical this. 

It looks like going stuck sizeable chunk population refuse get vaccinated. people surely going continue wearing masks to. people passing virus around other, likelihood new variant could emerge. obviously continue hope new variants covered vaccine, there's always chance won't. take chance?

I think America collectively decided pandemic over, that's that. studies I've seen show Pfizer Moderna vaccines lower efficacy contracting South African variant, still good preventing hospitalization death. believe they've enough time study it, recent variant India next troubling prospect. Meijer Bowling Green, KY. Aside staff, hardly anyone mask on. Yeah bad can't really younger kid, get germs require close daily contact tweens older kids do. 

Even mask home, can't imagine infant say, 6ish year old get pass (prior wide vaccine accessibility, least.) 

At ages parenting contact sport. Can't lock toddler bedroom say ""here's meals, good luck!"" need literally everything: dressing, bathing, help feeding toileting, brushing teeth, etc. 

My 4 year old still thinks hilarious try lick face given opportunity. I'm fully vaxxed gotten prior I'd counting days caught I've gotten literally every illness picked since infancy. 6 year old slightly better, wide enough margin feel like could avoid getting sick caught it. 

Hooray husband fully vaccinated now, I'm hoping kids get sooner rather later. makes sense. I'm curious everything plays out. I've seen reports new strains immune vaccines.

This one things equate does, though. hope right. say that. said unlikely they'll severe symptoms. Tell kids died thought Singapore using Pfizer &amp; Moderna vaccines we‚Äôre using US. case? Sadly would wait. one could potentially spread mono people vaccine site. Two immune system gonna everything get rid mono body, idk it‚Äôs wise get vaccine dose immune system already war. sure thinks he's invincible. used think thing 19. got reality check couple years later, there's hope him. trying dickhole, prior covid? You‚Äôre tough spot matter seems. Wow, many people nitpicking context comment.  It‚Äôs like said ‚Äúonly me‚Äù. Iyeesh. Everyone‚Äôs damn keyboard warrior.  CDC using game theory.

Under old mask guidelines, people refuse get vaccinated winners, able avoid vaccine, waiting everyone around get vaccine society slowly gets herd immunity. herd immunity reached, able reap benefits without vaccinated. Since everyone masked up, chances getting seriously infected low.

Removing mask mandate changes risk calculus folks. kids vaccinated. young. Guess I'm fucked then. yes? Considering often state bail local Amish communities whenever ""unexpected"" outbreak easily avoidable disease, we're going footing bill pockets morons.  also logistical side this, tackling age group simplest way decide gets jab disseminate info.

The government go: 35 book vaccine online loads will. went 35 50% able touch, extra admin would slow whole process down. He's sort centered. hyperbolic optimistic. amount energy save day small talk, forms emotional labor like keeping facial expression schooled, worth continued masking. energy hobbies work now! getting sick huge bonus. 27 people decimal then? IMO it'll June 15th CA lifts mask mandate  Dont worry much r/nothingeverhappens

After full year half US asses wearing masks one hard believe? shut fuck downvote.  understand that. Everyone seen first hand Michigan. Britain wraps vaccines program gets decent uptake younger people well, see prediction totally unrealistic. going spread start pushing 80% population immunity. Blast I‚Äôm wrong. Don‚Äôt 12s higher risk getting seriously ill dying influenza virus covid? Again, chances happening jogger passing low it‚Äôs almost negligible. outside (unvaccinated course) speaking someone infectious close contact extended period time, chance transmission could occur. jogger running poses negligible threat. 

This good interview Muge Cevik studies transmission. course risk zero, it‚Äôs much less. Need national state level. Get many hold outs vaccinated possible.

Send vaccine Universities campus doctors vaccinate students.  ready meet fate, athletes?

Say Olympics! life trying win medal! didn‚Äôt. still wear mask school. ass looking excuse spread anti-mask bullshit. visiting hospitals nursing homes, places full people could die flu even common cold.  factual. Children ineligible vaccine gold standard begin with. Instant block. Thanks!  could enjoy outdoor recreation lol  Makes wonder. know cases dude/girl got entire vial nurse forgot thin down? he/she get multiple entries? seems fair ask problem use it. Much better COVID lottery...   twenty firth conclusion, point I'm trying make:

1. Taipei sits close epicenter Wuhan, lots flights connecting populous countries frequent travel China.
2. Taipei also large population, dense cities. 
3. \*Ideally\* Taiwan could test every single person. That's possible need ensure system overwhelmed due limited hospitals medical professionals. 
4. strategy shut early quickly. Test existing cases already entered. Minimize risk spread aggressive quarantine contact tracing. 
5. cases accounted early on, make sense test entire population. individuals unaccounted time, community transmission widespread deaths would've happened last year. 
6. goal preserve capacities, readiness, resources leaks happen, like Taiwan experiencing right now. 
7. lot Taiwan CDC's emphasis self-care responsibility. Transparency clear protocols allow population relatively ready event outbreak. days first announcement local transmission, many companies immediately resorted various measures like working home, schools shut down, public buildings closed, etc. Streets Taipei empty. 
8. Yesterday's cases peaked 333 domestics. Today 240. 

&amp;#x200B;

Specific points alone cause massive spread. Scientific American article question density Covid spread. basic point density issue crowding

Thanks exposition. context size Taiwan's cluster vis-√†-vis resources. can't explain number jumping 20-30 300 couple days unless virus already spreading.

That's called community transmission. Density simply one factor many. Depending factors, speed transmission varies. tracing alone enough people lie, case mentioned. 

That's right, people selfish lie. resort several contact tracing tools like tracing apps, phone records, gps locations, transportation cards, name number registrations public buildings etc. 2019, 8 million people travelled China Taiwan. 6 million fro HK, another 6 million South Korea Thailand combined. Warnings appeared right lunar new year, everybody travelling.  understand testing. would high levels movement borders closed 2019 relate testing within community today? 

A lot travel = proximity epicenter affected areas = gravity situation CDC faces. test everyone including domestic population, would've severely overwhelmed. decision made aggressive border instead. Since early patients recovered, need aggressively test entire population instead save ammunition next wave. talking doctors regularly test anyone presents cold flu symptoms testing wastewater regularly signs Covid.

Oh that's already done symptoms. say second shot count next day. Slight fever joint pain exhaustion. Worth it, definitely good idea take next day case. comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

mega millions 1 302 million chance win $468 million (current jackpot), odds better there, plus there's secondary prizes, one 12 million chance win million (worse odds).

anyway, math probably off.

From currently know means people sick much. It'll reinforce immunity future variants. vaccinated catching covid ain't bad - people - makes immune response wider stronger. That‚Äôs said though lot unknowns even vaccines. Honest answer: never want disincentivize good behaviour/first movers. 

From behavioural economics public health standpoint, actually hits almost marks. entire state needs delay removal mask mandate select businesses??

I also read something mink traders unknowingly bringing virus Wuhan Yunnan province (where original SARS came from) quite pessimistic; think long tail shots delivered primary care physicians access initiatives vulnerable areas. take long time reach north 70% around cap hit. authentic hope doesn‚Äôt get upvotes. I'm talking them. Though true, concerning part USA currently supply constrained. first dose uptake enough focusing second doses, people taking them. Canada pass USA first doses administered (which soon) speaks volumes ability reach high level immunity.

And course per capita, possible way compare USA Canada going per capita...  moms school open whole time. small bouts remote learning. Teachers also weren‚Äôt part 1a group state initial rollout. Oddly enough ski patrol considered higher priority teachers. antivax, matter. different current vaccination schedule, millions shots, miniscule amount reactions.  that's enough them. could also explain edge gained 0.5% marketshare December 2020 April 2021 way filter specific flairs subreddit? like color red.

So... mod removed post referenced article published March 2020 discussed pandemic started CDC encouraged people wear masks, CDC stated effective... months later CDC changed stance pro masks, started providing instructions properly use them. 

This change CDCs stance masks vaccinated people, IMO, drive increase vaccination rates putting carrot (not wear mask) stick.

I feel like vaccination rates higher going another statement saying masks needed again, regardless vax status still middle raging pandemic, witnessed worse week cases since onset. heard something mink farms. point article demonstrate that, even opening eligibility everyone 18+, Canada way pass US % population willing get first dose. unfortunate mask mandate dropped NY. young child, barely able go beach since use public bathrooms. relied everyone wearing masks ad one things enabled us go year. restaurants, parks trails even toy stores. little kid already given much past 14 months. got sense yesterday still haven‚Äôt figured exactly date anticipate virus levels low enough public health advisors feel comfortable mask-off free-for-all. guess one May 28th (right MDW), June 1st, June 15th (CA‚Äôs date).  following state-by-state data seems like states really well, stopped around 30%, case? thought would issue Alberta Sask far happened.  trend FL basically flat since New Year, that's spite massive tourism influx. trend shows there's little difference locked down, going life normal. think bunch provinces second doses slated done end July, supply chain backs too. absolutely increases supply there‚Äôs enough doses double vax 86% total population end July, 0.5-11 y/o‚Äôs won‚Äôt eligible it‚Äôll enough everyone eligible.

And imagine many would many people would go hospital instead mild flu. Stop stupid, vax that. happy PA resident rn Yes, sorry right edited it! Herd immunity fine theory, maybe small pockets time/space certain social groups, etc. okay least currently (in US least), herd immunity ever pipe dream. Politics made political issue rather scientific issue, percentage public choose never get vaccine.

But, guess still early pandemic, I'm sure republican base decimated 10 years hitting close home, people change tune.

Exactly. people basic understanding statistics probability, they'd already vaccine.  realize mask wearing wearer? would good compromise, immunosuppressed like me, too. would make feel safer go pharmacy, pretty much place go anymore.  great idea. refusals hesitancy, logical reason say no, heard xyz Facebook, blah. 

So concrete reason say yes get that. obvious rational arguments, like protect others, work people empathy. Pharma regulated field, know someone needed month work simply add Braille labelling medication packaging. 

I know details assume Pfizer prove storing one month impact vaccine efficiency, proof reviewed expert committee. takes time. going inject drug big fraction population cannot afford take *we confident safe* valid answer, want solid proof. it‚Äôs required thanks. I‚Äôm already looking businesses state don‚Äôt to. Lol fuck demands. Young people want liberal? Let people please. People kids? start common ones I've seen:

* mRNA vaccines changes DNA (lol)
* Micro-chip stuff
* Vaccines prevent spread
* vaccines sufficiently tested

Other that, many seems either exaggerate understate risks covid. much deadlier flu, time deadly young adults children (although still follow recommandations get vaccine possible, notthing else prevent spreading virus at-risk groups). changed yesterday, indicate why. MUST opt-in now. can‚Äôt imagine young child able keep mask properly place seals.

Exactly! idea CDC take account people refuse get vaccinated laughable. children unvaccinated must wear mask. miss part? 

only fully vaccinated option others nothing changed. wear mask like 1 year 2 months  Worked ER last year, month two ago respiratory viruses werent COVID basically didnt exist last year. seeing big bump regular old colds recently, though. this, users sub you. long disease live 

You mean long ""*virus*,"" disease, 

Remain viable. ""How long virus remain viable..."" Viruses living, metabolism can't replicate own. complicated phrasing, Reddit Facebook. surfaces car home recovers?

Transmission virus via surfaces basically happen. really want safe, open windows minutes. car sun since friend drove it, would say air 100% safe. sure whether vaccine produced immune response you, tests take check level COVID antibodies t-cells.

It tell vaccine produced enough immune response considered safe. currently millions active COVID cases, either  Based vaccination rates fact vaccine 100% effective.

If go grocery store, spend hour wandering around shopping unvaccinated people, chances good I'll exposed virus. like idea that.

Also, sitting work large office 8hrs day. thanks. 

It's premature imo. mean, bicameral legislative branch. One chamber equally represents states reflection population density. small town like small town (and they're despite tell themselves), people like gossip.

Start telling people vaxxed dont know let people know. people saying mean stuff.

The town gossips soon get word out. I'm sure mean. dangerous think COVID healthy children? take advice pediatrician child's health? Yes, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt wear masks outside‚Äù wasn‚Äôt exactly good incentive people understood outside best ventilation (unless shoulder shoulder people) COVID transmission outside incredibly rare.

It‚Äôs like Department Public Transportation told get driver‚Äôs license don‚Äôt wear seatbelt parked car anymore. They're constantly tests determine limits. Hence updated information. mention years flu shots like 10% effective. basically useless Oh god, hate people need incentive, kind genius. Recieved first Pfizer dose days ago. :)  worry young cities London many boroughs less half population vaccinated. Like live average age 36, 46% population vaccinated according data available. large chunk population became eligible April 15, none people two weeks past second dose yet. hasn‚Äôt! We‚Äôve went flatten curve vaccinations we‚Äôre herd immunity? Please.  Indiana needs least kind monetary incentive. one things convince people what's necessary. You‚Äôre right covid outcome same, difference one idea contains shit not. Indeed! Apart basically putting US honour system mask wearing right last push :/  odds winning still astronomically small.

 Statistically, likely struck lightning today win million dollars EVER. reason we‚Äôre allowed talk shit white people getting vaccine. comes abysmal rates Bronx, need focus outreach understanding. Yeah, think stupid needlessly prolongs stuff. Public Health Agency takes risky approach controlling spread ultra-low risk approach vaccinations. like Germany separate queue Vector Vaccines brief risks, permitting want get earlier. Ohio clearly knows demographic people want vaccine. care. I'm two strong immunosuppresants ulcerative colitis. even feel safe going local CVS pick prescriptions. Toronto went 60% adults yesterday. Still quite bit go Pfft. kind anti-mask nonsense this? /s dad told grandpa washed sink day took bath every sunday whether needed not.

people back must smelled bad, remember pre-air conditioning woulda thought global pandemic would make fewer people want naked person hygiene park bench rubbing them.  all. think situation buying lotto instead paying rent indicative gambling addiction issue lottery much personal disfunction. 

All good things moderation. still figuring science out. Apparently specialized antibody tests better others. study going right UPMC. drunk drivers make home without incident, even crash rarely hurt others

Poor analogy since can‚Äôt take vaccine protect drunk drivers. can, however, protect COVID-19. every vaccine given, group efficacy rises, too. superbly protected individually, I‚Äôm getting benefits group protection, too! 

You guys keep leaving vaccine angle imply it‚Äôs bad unmask now, hitch wagon either insignificant populations risk-wise (children) marginal cases going always risk (immunocompromised, e.g.). it‚Äôs ‚Äújust weeks‚Äù challenged. It‚Äôs service finding reason move on. get it. scared change here. Kids born 90s reaching 30 years old. that's obvious shocking haha. 30 great, though. get adult confidence decade life. would weird... import virus Yunnan initial outbreak highly human-to-human transmissible virus Wuhan, instead Yunnan. im saying data clearly showed downtrend positive cases, hospitalizations, deaths since rollout vaccine. Yet cdc kept recommending masks. now, even though data hasnt changed way all, apparently right time take masks off? 

Get conspiracy bullcrap. Nah. I'll probably still wearing it. kid going summer camp mask free I‚Äôm perfectly fine that! I‚Äôve seen plenty articles well immunity previous infection works. problem it‚Äôs brought get downvoted hell because, reason, ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know long lasts‚Äù complaint works type immunity forgotten applies vaccines. People either reading current data (when covid back Nov ‚Äò20 still thought last 3 months, whereas recently I‚Äôve seen LEAST 9 months) don‚Äôt care enough want mad people dare bring up. Please respond college received degree from, It‚Äôll go block list child never go to. probably harder till it‚Äôs EUA phase. 

Though mask unless vaccine easier enforce that‚Äôs current OSHA guideline. stage multi mutant Much sensible limiting 65 ffs. would much supply would let everyone 41 take it. scared needles, scared hospitalization lots needles, IV's, etc. big scientific breakthrough Covid learning it‚Äôs airborne, cold flu probably are, too. 

We used accept waterborne illnesses drinking water 100 years ago. treat air quality like water quality today, longer need accept colds flu way cloth mask effective used combination 11+ mitigation methods schools: Cohorts, distancing, ventilation, staying home kids symptoms, etc.

Cleaning air schools HEPA filtration systems ventilation would likely much bigger impact masking, isn‚Äôt detrimental learning. Right?? thinking ""Damn, people get shots means odds go even more!"" realized else means felt like horrible person lol wearing mask prevented getting COVID, luck did. also wore mask whenever required, even outdoors. Still got COVID. Spreading misinformation like actually harmful causes stigma.  better state small prizes within state. 10 - $1 million prizes state still half-billion total odds winning state go drastically. worst part right mask holdout places go places without mask, running 1 2 places requirement really gets ya you‚Äôll clue mask you‚Äôll forgotten it. expected higher 50% I've seen study several others far worse results like one (linked below) 46% antibody response antimetabolite immunosuppression medications. Please note organ transplant patient however medications similar dosing IBD.   Incentive would get shot get rid masks , saying isn‚Äôt incentive *Supposed to* operative here. House Representatives facsimile representation population since lifetimes.

When HIV hit Japan pretended exist years years. I'm years 40 shit keeps getting better. I'm best shape life (says lot bad younger) I've gotten place give single fuck people think fucked youth thinking constantly.

It's always worse. Canada full vaccination rate 3.8%. eclipse Texas? states lowest vaccination rates opened least month yet devolve mad max hellscape. spike problem threatens overwhelm healthcare system. see spike flu cases every winter. enough high risk people vaccinated spike wont overwhelm healthcare system reward ones want get vaccinated money GET vaccine. get it..I do. way get ""everyone"" vaccinated yes, understand lottery..but ones get rewarded ones without asked too?! 

My kid throws trash something without asked, reward him. Companies reward hardest worker one sits hardly work door time up. least guys date, unlike us NJ....  No, get shots. people demographic COVID isn‚Äôt life threatening event them, there‚Äôs high necessity get shot. nothing life changes pre-vaccine post-vaccine, there‚Äôs incentive. forgot vaccination protects care people do. think estimate people. mother law's retirement plan win lottery hit big slots. joke legit plan. 401k used basically really expensive savings account. Right ""retired"" cashed remodel house renting someone else.  renter sold house making profit remodel without giving dime.   I'm young flu ""really suck"" me. treat nyquil dayquil FUCKING WAY!!!!!

In month two everyone wants get vaccinated get vaccinated give shit. Bring Darwin awards! still feel sorry want get vaccinated can't. BTW, got shots life returning back normal. worries :) People realizing amount people vaccinated outside America way lower, guess come vacation spread new variants far deadly. 45% increase?

Uh... making numbers up? would 8 fold higher increase Ohio saw. suppose you‚Äôre right. People go nuts powerball big numbers rather better odds. I‚Äôm favor better odds guess I‚Äôm minority. sucks. state in? Berlin vaccination centers open 60 years older, plus lots occupations, various serious health conditions.

NRW, birth year 1951 older prio 3 job indication . Everyone else , see doctor's office . I‚Äôm sure vaccinated people care though?   Fair enough swing miss. like rest posts. wrong. hey bud dont let facts get way narrative. Illinois can‚Äôt afford that. would work though. Great, tell Phil Murphy lift indoor mask mandate. statistic way low obvious reasons. people fully vaxxed constant contact unvaxxed people ‚Äúnormal‚Äù conditions

Start putting people back packed bars, subways, long distance buses/trains, indoor concerts etc months months see plenty breakthrough cases

Not saying vaccines don‚Äôt work, obviously they‚Äôre amazing. breakthrough death rate noticeably higher people quoting conditions totally different comment replied to.  already problem businesses, people wearing masks people chosen vaccinated.

I'm fully vaccinated, keep wearing mask around unmasked, unvaccinated individuals.

I totally agree One issue number representatives hasn‚Äôt changed since 1913. population goes up, number people person represents keeps going up. really expand house

1913 - 1 Representative every ~212,000 people

2021 - 1 Representative every ~762,000 people Bigger numbers better.

I talking guy who's going get vaccinated make international travel wants next summer asked $100 guaranteed like ""You think I'd sell $100?"" told lottery Ohio straight tell he'd it, obvious he'd go get vaccinated even keep wraps keep street cred r3ds.

5 $1M winners going drive particpation 50 $100k winners. Source? [ECDC website shows 187 Condescending  Rounded 100% effective.

Target WalMart never enforced stores.  Depends variants vaccine

The mRNA 75% South Africa variant estimated 90% India variant.

So plenty vaccinated people get sick die. 

In fully open unmasked/undistanced world, strains become dominant, millions breakthrough illnesses tens hundreds thousands death (over time). breakthrough numbers look good it‚Äôs fairly small period time limited environment. we‚Äôre back open, become far prevalent exposures mass spreader events become common due large number unvaxxed 

Most people see acceptable  Changing faster one make list. unvaccinated eligible trust anyone: choice run **get vaccinated**. NOW

run...what still here?

**GO** fear WEARING one makes look republican? I‚Äôm thinking opposite  study said side effects. still safe. hilarious going /r/worldnews threads China saying something low effort, hardly controversial like ""China reason censor internet"" watch get like +20 so, like -45 two three days after.

Normal times *almost* again! I'm sure else left public health accomplish ultimately people want get vaccinated states. real endpoints COVID restrictions would preserve health care capacity flattening curve provide stopgap vaccines available. people refuse vaccination, know imposing restrictions supposed accomplish. There's enough immunity states stop hospitals overcrowded. Even protected unvaccinated people getting COVID another year, they'd position year now. We're going see COVID eradicated decade, ever. vaccinated people rightfully wanting lives transmission happening private gatherings can't really regulated, seem like there's real way stop unvaccinated people ever getting COVID. call attitude -- call show competence. good.

But hey...there's lot incompetence spread around worldwide. seems norm. usa, vaccine problem. Problem medical nature. shrink said father man status got sick big vaccine ended hospital cos didnt waited long enough quarantine, father literally acts like take gun shoot head! Need find source prove safe get vaccinated I'm trying negative Nancy article completely bogus. They're touting 6% increase vaccine appointments two days policy announced. Anyone even 101-level understanding policy say absolutely cannot determine meaningful impact numbers time interval.

You also can't imply causation know external variables affecting this. DeWine announced would lifting mask mandate June 2nd announced vaccine lottery. (at least) equally plausible that, boost something statistical noise, people mask mandate combination factors.

And math little clearly, ""boost"" they're talking equals roughly 1,500 appointments. kind laughable surprising DeWine's administration would jump chance take appointment boosts Friday afternoon plant flag ""look great job did!"" I'm pretty sure China know either whether natural lab leak, wants block investigation case turns latter.

Hah, yes! knowing use better good, least helpful situation. maybe different issue.  You‚Äôre downvoted wording pretty rude. core you‚Äôre saying isn‚Äôt false though. Even pandemic ended tomorrow, people immune compromised would still need take precautions. common cold could life threatening. It‚Äôs unfortunate, it‚Äôs fair, it‚Äôs reality. got 2nd Moderna vaccine shot yesterday afternoon felt fine besides mildly sore arm. woke today shivering feeling cold. felt like cold slowly dragging dreams. Closed windows, wore clothes, upped central thermostat, portable electric heater bedroom. toasty feel comfortable. forget mention cold? COLD!!

I'm seeing commenters experienced something similar. agree unless enough people antibodies really matter agree. opposed vaccines one ignorant, harmful, privileged positions take, qualms letting anti-vaxxers know that. right one thing - completely isolated society refuse injection dangerous road go down. want anyone kind power, means masking bit longer, I'm happy to. Technically, vaccinated day 14, CDC charge technical definitions. reality, immunity probability curve mostly levelled day 7 continue increase day 14 beyond.  wow wtf sitting huge stock. lot people see Wawa Sheetz already don‚Äôt wear masks, nothing changed here. shouldn‚Äôt newsworthy‚Ä¶ aren‚Äôt they??? Japan seems like pretty progressive country don‚Äôt get talk long-haul COVID sufferers. friend similar boat. age group low death rate, friend got COVID, survived, suffering long haul effects months. Basically life changing. Suddenly imaginary worries vaccine disappeared. Yeah, probably will. really know Ohio live though, really can't cast aspersions - give credit - places kind authority. Yes! clearly anxiety. Pretty sure fed govt didnt lift mandates. local state govt none states reporting anywhere close reported sitting home wondering whats going on. would want manipulate data.. list reasons could long. look China one example easy maintain power whatever want citizens terrified made social pariahs go govt says true. Literally ""Pfizer graph"" comes bunch kind article vaccinated people stopped testing negative around day 12, exposed least 5 days prior, like what, 14 days prior?  ""Some 93% doses administered CoronaVac vaccine, manufactured Chinese state run pharmaceutical Sinovac, 7% effective Pfizer BioNTech vaccine. know lot people anti-vax losing minds vaccine- single one even tiny bit religious. however, dumb. Maybe quit age group lowest vaccine uptake half population vaccinated, that's counting people one dose two dose vaccine. Businesses know vaccinated glance, instead something like setting bouncer door something like giving people wristbands show they're vaccinated go unmasked they're asking everyone keep wearing mask.

After all, unvaccinated still go unmasked according CDC. partially vaccinated go unmasked according CDC. Telling everyone wear mask unvaccinated partially-vaccinated still protected completely reasonable mask trivial burden strictly need it. Anti vaxxers saying vaccines know long term effects virus either, there's lot precedent viruses causing problems road vaccines.

Oh wait, forgot ""aren't really vaccines"" ""they even work"" It‚Äôs hard believe every retail worker worst time world. constantly feel like siege Covid. That‚Äôs healthy way live. don‚Äôt see worked Saturday see many people feel way. It‚Äôs almost like unrealistic view COVID-19. That‚Äôs say quite them. People sound descriptions happy healthy people otherwise go mine 2 weeks 2e dose, im getting 1e dose week, trust anyone seeing anti covid rules protestors im probably gonna stay home rest life people gone. ignorant see vaccinated individuals cannot spread virus like unvaccinated ppl? 

i've worn masks since start pandemic. seen loved ones year. say hi nephews behind gate. home entire year. 

enough enough. 

the virus rate never going reach 0%. Ron Howard: ""They won't."" Thanks, points make sense. easy look charts compare cases vaccinations, cases like lot context needed find info it! time free coffee Tuesday. Plenty non-covid reasons keep mask on.

\-People asthma respiratory conditions

\-People live areas lot air pollution

\-People immunocompromised

\-Women sick hearing ""smile!"" often

\-People wanting go low profile

\-People liking get sick 2020 liked it

\-People still want stick non-maskers

\-People miss (like me) able tell idiots apart easily

Et cetera. interesting bit imo too. ""written evidence professional side border"" sufficient vaccination proof allow quarantine-free trip across border, border open basically immediately anyone vaccinated. implies govt-approved vaccine passport needed prove vaccination happened. give update. It‚Äôs 28-days since I‚Äôve fully vaccinated (2-weeks post 2nd Pfizer shot). time, I‚Äôve going gym maskless, along 95% people also workout there. 

Despite that, still contracted COVID. far, looks like vaccine working.  follow numbers closely should.

I think obligation that. Follow personal doctor, local health authority, CDC guidance, honest covid-number watching game point. nope. invent stuff around

fully vaccinated protected also variants. because:

**even somehow get trace COVID vaccine-educated immune system easily contain (no spread outside body spread INSIDE body).**

Literaly thing wish redditors would stop saying nonsense. 


Care explain, think so?  CDC general lost credibility comes masks, whether beginning pandemic, now. part...it depends NJ are. North Jersey pretty good adhering mask mandates can‚Äôt even come global strategy manage one right now. Well done. right realistic Sweden made foolish gamble, thinking could somehow get herd immunity quickly. point bet still tiny fraction exposed. end day, bothers me. I'm OK wearing one going forward I'm sick, know what? uncomfortable don't' like breathing simple piece cloth. think people meant see other's faces facial expressions.  throw fit requirement bought helped slow spread virus. also buy there's reason wear vaccinated. 

I'm ok people wearing masks want to, there's factual/logical/medical reason it, I'm going want shamed either. Ohio 54.3% look population. reasonable assume people vaccinate kids around rate think, opens different age groups would expect trend similiarly.

Mississippi worst 42.1% (of followed Alabama Louisiana 44%. Every state 48% higher think. strongly suspect states get there, areas drag behind rural areas, dense cities. 

Texas instance ""only"" 54.4% Austin, TX like 65%. talking point dangerous already going maskless part. Even wore mask get store required immediately putting nose/chin etc. know calculate odds expected values probably need incentive get vaccinated. also reshuffled CDC's pandemic modeling data, analytics visualization task forces. 


If results different data guidelines CDC, faith CDC lost. Science change controversy-- that's weathered throughout entire pandemic. bend public backlash walk back guidelines, reason believe CDC making (tough) decisions based science. lost cause sure. mostly states large black populations. Rather asking questions might improve vaccine access reduce hesitancy among minority communities, subreddit decides dump southern states.

Divisiveness cheap shots poorer states helpful. y'all actually pushing people away getting vaccinated toxic attitudes assume everything political.

Can ask nicely respectfully? hard? need many value judgments, especially point pandemic, several miracle vaccines save lives?

I'm specifically replying you, folks saying ""shit hole"" states. helpful. go back normal 1 - 2 months? businesses states dropped mask mandates months ago?

Texas dropped protocols March 10. Seems like they‚Äôre fine? 

Point examples states mask mandates months. reason expect different outcome states requiring masks now?

Two months ago asked happen Texas would definitely said case numbers going rise they‚Äôll see going unmasked mistake.

But didn‚Äôt happen I‚Äôm surprised anyone. 

I agree logic says lifting mask mandates put unvaccinated people risk point can‚Äôt ignore evidence doesn‚Äôt seem huge effect overall case numbers.

Maybe number people immunity (vaxxed + previously infected) actually high enough keep numbers down? Soon saw like, yep, would work. sub strange mix nowadays.

It seems like anti-‚Äúmasters‚Äù anti-vaxxers overlap lot ways. much. Johnson Johnson single injection vaccine. vaccinated yet, live USA, that's great option you! could probably get vaccinated today. doctor, seems (based read Reddit hear friends/family) side effects til next day common. happened doses second one flu-like symptoms hours 23-30 shot. I'd like see stats well various vaccines protect known variants. Despite vaccinated, suspect still wear mask circumstances (like flying!) Non-aggression principle. pretty much fully protected shhhhhh talking data shows metrics trending down

You originally talked mask mandate effect downward trend we've seeing. That's important talked temporary localized bumps.

Specifically related mask mandate, said factor put enough argument reader look data decide DOOOOOOOOOMED. 

Neither us said anything effect. would think reader would get take away? Unless that's think I've saying entire time?

Thats good point, probably vocal minority. link tweets? people Ohio different people everywhere, course. recent mask decision, I‚Äôve seen comments I‚Äôd like suggesting immunocompromised people children either mask (and shut up) go reasonable public places. Like sorry life circumstances, tried never going again? lockdown thing hated much seem refuse again. that.

I understand eventually begin stop wearing masks, empathy ‚Äúwe‚Äôll get get there‚Äù outlook seems window.

Stay strong hope people still continue get vaccines reach actual proper numbers people situation feel safer. need wake-up call, that's literally exact strategy. New Zealand Australia fine it. Taiwan's failure due low testing rates refusal snap lockdown. Wow, it‚Äôs like thing thinner morons logic dignity selling loud position equivalent dollar scratch Especially things like contact sports real risk blood contamination. Regular HIV testing high school athletes. Lolllll. You‚Äôre/were getting vaccines don‚Äôt lose 750k Americans every year. You‚Äôre still going potentially bad time immunocompromised get covid. I‚Äôm sure familiar anecdotal evidence works, yet actively fight challenging personal findings. came conclusion masks help infection rates, yet disregard implications children going less, parents also going less isolating. Essentially; children need sloppy adults get illnesses spread first place. 

Regardless age, you‚Äôre responsible part children‚Äôs education, yet rhetorical restraints belief systems. example, I‚Äôm aware masks change population infection rates, studied. However, taking implication personal level insinuating solely responsible reducing infection rates shattering medical bill bit lunatic. Saaaame Also, 100 people room, 50 vaccinated, another 15 immune prior infection, leaving 35 vulnerable, person sick Covid enters, completely different situation 100 vulnerable sick person enters. Even latter case, vast majority people would infected. former case, fraction fraction. Exponentials work directions. yet, plan asking go later month. lol would want force people get vaccinated need it? Like people already covid. stupid; pure genius. One smartest policy proposals I've ever seen. I‚Äôm pro ending mask mandates. June 15 blink eye. people whatever want private. time see variant, it‚Äôs late. don‚Äôt know Americans prevention things. wait boiler breaks floods basement causing thousands damage instead replacing earlier. keep rebuilding houses flood hurricane zones. drive car check engine light transmission needs rebuilt. don‚Äôt react potentially highly infectious deadly enough virus seeing hundreds cases day. Plenty toddlers babies died covid. common, I'd rather take chances. 

Everyone 12 unable get vaccine. Therefore, unvaccinated adults wear masks protect people.  Thank goodness Thats getting paid that... organic campaigns. Apparently they're really worried going burn unvaccinated population due high transmissibility relaxing NPIs.

From [SAGE variant 40% 50% transmission advantage nationally compared B.1.1.7, sensitivity analyses modelling roadmap England (SAGE88) indicate likely progressing Step 3 alone (withno local, regional, national changes measures) would leadto substantial resurgence hospitalisations (similar to, largerthan, previous peaks). Progressing Steps 3 4 theearliest dates could lead much larger peak. Smaller transmissionadvantage would lead smaller peaks.  Scott Gottlieb says mask mandates would naturally collapsed within couple weeks nobody wearing masks June. trust guy anyone. I'd put money Newsom eventually caving removing restrictions earlier planned. messed world live we‚Äôre shipping people vaccines instead way around. Anything change convince her? people paid slave wages time probably would big deal. current wage slave situation United States truly blame. top literally added billions net worth virus going complaining tax increases start speaking wallets go. done pandering rich affecting EVERY aspect lives decades. know are. Oh thank God. important /u/etrigone good plan. would done weren't? waiting bated breath. Yup. family members refusing reason well could be. say ""dropped x rate vaccinations"", says ever would? still airport security changed happened 9/11. Europe governments provided exit lifting curfews like.

When governments/organizations/people gain power, tend want keep it. ""I immune system""

The people died covid-19 immune system, except know fight off. world‚Äôs first reported trial examine level immune protection Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine cancer patients, shows anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses week three, following first dose vaccine, 39% 13% solid blood cancers respectively, compared 97% without cancer. 

The study, called SOAP, also reports second dose vaccine given three weeks first dose, immune response improved significantly solid cancer patients 95% showing detectable antibodies SARS-CoV-2 virus within two weeks. contrast, get vaccine boost three weeks see real improvement, 43% solid cancer patients 8% blood cancer patients developing antibodies Pfizer vaccine five weeks compared 100% healthy controls.""

TLDR: first shot give less protection cancer patients, second dose give 95% cancer patients antibodies. antibodies perfect indicator immunty, data currently encouraging.

Ideally, everyone around vaccinated still protected vaccine protection less optimal. know businesses families small chilldren like elderly beginning pandemic: first 2 hours shops available families little ones can't currently vaccinated.

Everyone wear mask 2 hours, parents bring children along age 12, child severe comorbidities.

The rest day unmasked businesses choose offer it. worked well grocery stores Northeast. see can't different group people. 

I think good compromise everyone.  Hah, assumed stopped requiring long ago. weeks ago, went Kroger first time months, maybe 20% shoppers wearing mask. Gotta love south.

On bright side, reinforce decision stay home nearly 100% time since March 2020. house mini senate since capped #. Except doesn‚Äôt get cool things senate Aside Costco/Target/Walmart type places, indoor businesses huge well ventilated warehouses. would even say warehouses super well ventilated even larger hundreds people inside time accumulating particles air isn‚Äôt good. Mass transit may well ventilated times, number people time air exchanges I‚Äôd say different. (Doors open ever stop, movement trains pushes air around, buses windows open, absolute numbers people lower busy grocery store) wish much properly dengue vaccine.
Hopefully possible mRNA. guess understand using word like ""hate"" ""love"" mask. need love masks respect valuable tool mitigating spread respiratory diseases. vote No, gives governor power extend emergency powers indefinitely. Yes means majority vote people, closer government run‚Äîwith internet cars days need representatives anymore. possible poster miserable time take care business younger. Work hard younger, party older. See mine downvoted oblivion haha. WEIRD. plot twist: 331 million has, like him. honest threat also trends. think one first big names calling rescinding mask guidance vaccinated people weeks ago. 

Contrast with, say, Eric Feigl-Ding troglodytes deny thing looks respectable any. mean, won‚Äôt. everyone welcome want. That's point. Progress continue, long tail measured months days weeks. We're going see many 0.1-0.2% daily increases percentage adult population vaccinated May. Usually lots qualifiers based liberal estimates production national stockpile size. Basically, worst case scenario yearly like flu shot. public universities require proof vaccinations? covid vaccines get full FDA approval, excuses places like can't require covid vaccine like others Ever flu history ever go hospital? still really sucks. 34 happening years always strive maximize rights citizens, sometimes need restrictions achieve this. That's murder illegal, infringes rights another human.

The covid restrictions we've seen Europe totally proportion sure lead degradation rights might never recover from. ""Doctors, however, say evidence prove cow dung cure COVID-19.""

Best line article. really starting feel way. Follow science trust experts right? doesn‚Äôt matter long vaccinated. CDC doesn‚Äôt think unvaccinated pose much threat kids since risk serious case. mean people 14 months think they‚Äôll live another month lol 100% population going become immune. Without fail. choice getting jabbed getting sick. Covid endemic going remain so. Back aftah dis  proof anyone gotten yet ""concerns"" like safety, efficacy, 5G conspiracies full shit. actually believed things, would small chance pile cash suddenly allay fears?

Unless live usually cold area, would assume 3 days plenty time virus fully inactivated. Cuz people NJ don‚Äôt care mask mandate. everything normal wear mask shopping? Doesn‚Äôt seem like big deal us. entire month Masks Social Distancing lowest rates country. don‚Äôt know Newsom expects people adhere mandates regulations Country rapidly going back normal. workplace brought back everyone working remotely back office packed making social distancing impossible. cleaning precautions taking gone nothing. also steady stream customers soon likely longer required wear masks. can't work remotely, option science pointed masks partially effective everyone wearing them. asked doctor it? Remember, you‚Äôre medical professional self diagnosis dangerous likely misinformed. likely link evidence shouldn‚Äôt linked jump inappropriate conclusions. US thank Republicans anti-vaxxers dropping ball here. one saying let run unchecked, deal HIV (which, left unchecked kill 100% population mind you) barely eroding basic rights surely we've seen enormous overstepping bounds.

Month long curfews across much European countinent _not_ reasonable reaction. Contact tracing, testing, vaccinations WFH recommendations would effects living parallel version China.

Covid temporary, authoritarianism stay decades.  young siblings gotten vaccine. they're stupid bad people. they're apathetic. lottery direct cash payment state, bet would get vaccine.

I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre vaccinated truly trust it‚Äôs efficacy, nothing worry about. don‚Äôt, argument starts crumble. Rocket.. Surgery??? Lmao. ""Herd immunity"" number depends high R0 covid really is. 

If around 3, 70% people immune would work out. However, unfortunately vaccines give 100% immunity infection, particularly single dose (although incredibly effective preventing serious cases, hospitilizations, death).

Data UK suggests Pfizer reduces chances infection 61% first dose (89% second dose), risk death 85% one dose. R0 3, reach true herd immunity first doses alone absence social distancing, although spread would substantially reduced hospitilizations/deaths would dramatically reduced. 

After second dose, would expect need 75% population vaccinated achieve ""herd immunity"" R0 3. 

However, one thing likely working favor probable people get infected covid vaccine (first second dose, less likely pass on. well studied, fact serious cases strongly mitigated suggests viral loads likely lower, meaning people would less transmissible.

In summary, vaccines incredibly good, particularly preventing deaths hospitilizations. would bit wary putting much faith ""70% population first doses"" herd /r/theydidthemonstermath ""We're Endgame now"" Brilliant idea.

The thing right first sentence mask mandate lifted March. **Rt went statewide, particularly urban areas.** Then, moved goalposts Rt 1, *barely* right 0.01, completely wrong urban areas.

Every metric gone either. We've increase younger demographics upticks hospitalizations regional levels.

To summed ""Removing mask mandate measurable negative impacts Covid recovery,..."". since provided data literally showed that. Looks like coronavirus affect IQ. probably quite people natural immunity Texas open since last summer. also really large population people think virus serious. even symptoms, likely get tested unless ended hospital. Epidemiologists saying along cases severely underestimated state (and country). 

How long natural immunity last anyone's guess. know people (the elderly particular) vaccinated already getting reinfected variants circulating now. Younger people fine awhile. vaccinated population get boosters. refuse vaccinate likely get reinfected point. we're going see numbers go among vaccinated.

I fully vaccinated Pfizer miracle job mainly on-location inside offices

I think mask etiquette make clients comfortable well

I'll wearing light mask (KF94 earloops 3M9502+ headbands) default agreed I'll take off.

at least now.

I wearing 3M8210 anymore love watching people blame wrong people too. 6 months ago would one person blame now, someone else's fault. interesting. want protection, soonest get it. pretty much means: take approved vaccine available you. Take Sinovac vaccine. strange focusing office environment opposed schooling environment.

The office environment important since vector mostly protected vaccinated parents. vaccinated parents concerned spreading children, wear N95 work and/or wear mask home. little risk spreading home.

As kids go daycare something effect, I'd recommend finding daycares still masking, putting requirements vaccination caregivers, look outdoor settingslike sports camps like. also look hybrid work environments. white collar workers home time, there's truckloads still working home working hybrid. going back office full time seem exception, rule.

And again, risk children lower many already accepted risks car accidents influenza. Expecting large changes life small risk really feasible. Gus animated much higher quality one would expect state lottery ad campaign? Oh, thought started today?

It's also interesting mention Australia New Zealand, actually following Taiwan doctrine instances whereby *it work, get back Taiwans zero-covid level lockdown!* I‚Äôve seen similar things well. Though AZ guy seemed think anti-bodies produced single wouldn‚Äôt enough handle Indian variant. Dude likely fear mongering. Thanks, I'm specifically looking downtime day vaccine.

Even 2-3 weeks 1st shot efficacy reported around 80% come realize don‚Äôt really want around vast majority people anyways. Seriously, like got vaccinated hate people trying tell still wear mask limit go public. Like point vaccine everyone‚Äôs saying still need masks mean, shots still administered right?

At least thats Irish mates saying.

Just makes bit hard track atm.  Well small percentage die. non-vaxxers, non-mask wearers get Covid survive, say ‚Äúsee told so‚Äù. Sorry already asked, but...where find comprehensive collection false misleading covid19/vaccine claims? Change ""this exactly censorship demonstrates right cancel culture.""

Having frame demonstration idiocy. Removing frame censorship. sides wrong time. reason, subreddit extremely allergic masks. sure why. I'm keeping masks pandemic over. It‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôm living 20s 30s. difference back pains. mRNA tested extensively never found long term effects. brand new technology, they're new used mass scale.

It also breaks weeks, leaving nothing actually affect besides antibodies. long term effect: preventing disease.

Any hysteria long term effects, again, way mask anti-vax views point. people screeching supposed long term effects screeching something else 2 years.

Some vaccines like AZ even use mRNA.   already vaccinated lottery? Otherwise messed one point people getting vaccinated create herd immunity cannot get vaccinated? 
And vaccine designed decrease chances contracting covid, eradicate disease. (Or least data we've got now) You‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs not. 500 mil compared 2 bill cheap Ok we'll leave kids home summer! ""Follow science""  Current interval 16 weeks, soon shortened supply increases. reasoning behind one dose 80% vs 90+ two. So, better double population 80% half 90. Also, recent Pfizer study showed effective 3 month interval 3 weeks, so, far gamble paying off. UK following strategy worked well well. know weekend reporting inaccurate, definitely headed right direction. 7 day rolling average deaths (according CDC data) US 550, lowest since initial spike April 2020. week meant massive Ireland. health system hacked know many doses given. still eclipse US point couple weeks though.  .0009% fully vaccinated people hospitalized. 80% older 65. 30% hospitalized asymptomatic hospitalized covid. chances hospitalized fully vaccinated close chances struck lightning. 

The vaccines incredibly effective. much so, doesn‚Äôt matter people around not. Kids graduating college, opportunity make money ever have, likely refuse offer employer mandate vaccine. accepting job pay bills loans, current ability protect via vaccine, seems like bad decision graduates make. knew stripper wasn‚Äôt good job? literally said ‚Äúblood clots birth control effects patient‚Äù insanely wrong. People died blood clots AZ they‚Äôre different know treat them. Also, people died blood clots birth control AZ sheer number occurrences. Blood clots hormonal birth control way likely occur. doctor work hospital along side them, actually dealing specifically respiratory issues. tell you, seeing first hand experience, PEs birth control dangerous! Current interval 16 weeks, soon shortened. reasoning behind one dose 80% vs 90+ two. So, better double population 80% half 90. Also, recent Pfizer study showed effective 3 month interval 3 weeks, so, far gamble paying off. UK following strategy worked well well. Buried data shows current Covid vaccines use still effective new variant, one government official said Monday, although race vaccinate younger age groups, anyone previously accepted vaccine. Yes, trust immune system. people age 50. Immune systems amazing! That's vaccines use immune system protect disease.

The irony saying someone ""trusts immune system"" and, therefore, refuses get vaccine literally uses immune system protect remarkable.

They‚Äôre vaccinating 14 million people per day claiming single digit case counts. know it‚Äôs good. ~~A vaccine amazing that~~ people stupid bribe get it.... Vaccinated people higher risk struck lightning dying covid, stop dramatic heard anyone losing senses stuck hospital ventilator vaccine.

Also, even know booster would entail terms side effects, silly speculate point. Absolutely. We're awkward transition phase right now.

When vaccines started rolling everyone pissed phase 1b vs. 1c, old people vs. teachers, diabetes vs. asthma, sort stuff, long really last? Six weeks so? Yet that's anyone could talk seemed like would last forever.

It way masks near future. probably linger bit children vast, vast majority people middle June. cares? vaccinated minimal risk. kid can't get vaccine minimal risk virus. not-vaccinated choice that's choice that's risk take. immunocompromised minority rest world forced halt/restructure lives for. 30 minutes immediate family leave get second round. Goodluck us getting 2nd shot symptoms! 38% reduction deaths would still leave Sweden massively deaths neighbours, main argument used around Sweden disaster despite quite middle table compared european countries.

So probably plenty reasons, including understand, Sweden Norway death rates. man man Amen! one spouts narrative follow apparently page say 

""If you‚Äôre 50 trusting immune system""

DEEP STATE  c vaccine seems less effective Brazilian variant (color skeptical '50.4%' efficacy number Brazilian healthcare workers), becomes dominant strain worldwide, imagine there'd likely booster.

No question helps, especially alternative vaccine all.   don‚Äôt think info specified published yet, can‚Äôt imagine it‚Äôs hard do.


The CDC long tracking breakthrough cases unless results hospitalization May 1, 2021, CDC transitioned monitoring reported vaccine breakthrough cases focus identifying investigating hospitalized fatal cases due cause. shift help maximize quality data collected cases greatest clinical public health case counts, last updated April 26, 2021, available reference updated moving forward.

SpaceX COTS-1 mission.  Last-minute inspection showed crack near exit 2nd stage engine nozzle.  enough performance margin could make smaller nozzle rather swap engine sent tech interstage area tin snips shortened nozzle.   True. That‚Äôs awesome compromise. It‚Äôs nice someone considering compromise instead ignoring population disagree here. US response 9/11 led similar calls action still feel impacts today. 

Tensions still high, worry people may approve legislature without considering long term implications. nEEd yElLOw feVEr CeRtiFICAte gO GaBON WhatS Big DEal Trick treating back bitches! Also, please clamp production capabilities vaccines one over, next one come would nice _start_ 1billion+ doses month production rates... correct, there's reason speed process. used word ‚Äúkids‚Äù, referring kids young receive vaccine, 20 year old adults. obvious given we‚Äôre talking kids unable receive vaccine. 

Again, science tells us *kids* resistant vaccinated adult. brother lives Texas wear masks peak.. he's pretty sure got COVID going Lowes, even though wife wore mask one else (and half coughing away) days later wife got it. handy way revealing yourself. Makes easier rest us avoid them. don‚Äôt get comment. suggesting trust new guidelines mishaps early on? even that‚Äôs mean you‚Äôre comment certainly propagates mistrust CDC good anyone point. dont outbreak Nursing Home reading about. 20 fully vaccinated residents got infected (from unvaccinated staff) 1 died. Wow, honestly brilliant - wish would offer option. It‚Äôs penta-mutant Well yeah. Making bad decisions due checking something (relatively) easy check bad. ""We need make people get vaccines order return work school"" says young person returning spring break. Lmao commenting 5 day old post cringe conspiracy theories back forth helping. I've got feeling I'm see less less mask use honestly, get it. like get random person Facebook group state people fully vaccinated getting Covid ‚Äúall time‚Äù. keep hearing similar assertion over. 

When questioned statement, citing recent studies show fully vacced people approximately .008% chance getting Covid, said knew 6 people personally gotten Covid fully vacced, including mother currently hospitalized Covid got 3 weeks second dose. 

Maybe mom one unlucky got struck lightning- actually knows 6 people gotten unlucky? Riiiight. 

If actually true, highly, highly doubt it- would point vaccines? really frustrates people spread sort misinformation lie. believe lying. people this? don‚Äôt get it. Beam back 1960. ""My immune system works better smallpox vaccine."" I've predicting Memorial Day while, seems like pretty close right. I'm Texas too, think Memorial Day right us seem eager get past states.

This past weekend, saw significant drop mask compliance, really wonderful see!  typed words comment thread, assume aCtUalLy contributed conversation. science shows people younger 20 (including children) 44% less likely contract virus adults (non vaccinated). 

So it. wrong, confidently ignorant dangerously wrong. Spewing BS others blindly follow crap. fully vaccinated adults less likely adolescents contract virus, kids eligible vaccine given time get second shot since approved. dream randomly finding bunch cash without buying lottery ticket.  Sometimes data delayed. Minnesota recorded 0 deaths last Monday, next day recorded 9 deaths. interesting idea, never heard technology must protect children

all unvaccinated anti-vax anti-mask idiots MUST wear mask! everyone going pains 30s? im feel yet people talk 30s like elderly age already something Oh definitely knocking amount, odds getting vs taking $100 shot. 100G would dope lol makes sense. lottery players brightest. wtf point staying lockdown quarantine three weeks Canada states isn‚Äôt even wearing masks grocery store anymore? tired quarantine, I‚Äôm literally losing mind people don‚Äôt care live die.

Needle phobia real, it‚Äôs common. don‚Äôt look, won‚Äôt even feel one. It‚Äôs so, tiny. Lots people realizing remote work viable option warning without vaccine numbers rise social restrictions get lifted.

Yes CDC recommendations shape policy. true vaccinated people need worry masking distancing, CDC say (as have) rather lie potential policy changes occur it. annoying many people think CDC lie like policy changes happening now. So, expectation lockdowns benefits justify extreme health, social economic costs, it? Well. escalated quickly. missed point entirely.

One reason teens ASAP. want get vaccine soon travel. sounds like problem people checking vaccine cards door, people vaccinated. Take them.  way prevent another pandemic would isolation point. Spanish Flu, probably would lost 1/4th world due global travel works modern world. generation starting become awful adults used complain kids.

Speak yourself. answering OPs question. like technologically, medically, scientifically ...   Yeah, chills sucked, fever reducing medicine helped lot. agree that‚Äôs way high. 85% 65+ age group dose younger age groups obviously going far hesitant. also don‚Äôt know even approved vaccine 12s then.

I don‚Äôt buy narrative given enough time almost everyone come understand vaccines extremely safe already know they‚Äôll find convenient time get someday.

No, concept used convince small states like Rhode Island Delaware join Union first place rather stay independent. Slave states like Virginia Maryland New York ^(Fun fact, NY ended slavery 1827!) whole lot population got whole lot representatives anyway.

You might've thinking ""three-fifths compromise"" counted slaves three-fifths person apportioning House Representatives. slavers wanted count whole people maximize representation (since slaves vote); delegates free states wanted count (so slavers would less power); eventually settled three-fifths compromise. I'm banking anything daughter. let's real, world going hold everyone back sake daughter protect her. Believe me, I'm boat 3 year old. wife vaccinated understand risks. us handle handle daughter. Vaccinated people moving regardless think timing. determine risks act accordingly, simple. Sweet Japan seems like pretty progressive country

Um, Japan one conservative countries Asia. helps lot, thank you. think get next week.  Besides, remote learning nailed 

Nailed what, inside dumpster? CDC estimated 33% population already immunity infection. need factor too. based ""Science"",

The science always supported masking stop germs coming mouth, CDC excuse. ""belief"" anything. Look data yourself. Look complete lack consistency part people charge like Fauci. flip flops every month masks things. mention civil constitutional rights totally shit people lied virus mortality rate somewhere around 0.001% according estimates. people get information watching ""news"" grip reality unfortunately. Speaking fitting narrative, say ""it's same"" without reason? link it?  Vaccines teach immune system fight Covid without contracted it. functioning immune system going work well. Still effective reducing deaths among high risks groups. Without elderly would literally decimated. many millions undocumented residents. Caring persons origin something really combating covid. ? US highest reported number cases entire world ahead India Brazil. also call India Brazil task focusing countries exporting vaccines rest world? Sounds like episode Sliders, one parallel worlds overpopulated lottery winners given ""credit card"" without limit euthanized. praised society solid...funny life imitates art...v vendetta another good film that's relevant today... Referring groups proper noun, proper nouns capitalized. Glad takeaway article. pediatrician giving popation-wide statistics, talking specific child.

Except weren't. pediatrician said kids literally nothing worry respect COVID

 original statement. pediatrician specifically referring OP's children patients pediatrician. like month buy like $5 scratchers get snacks? Trump deserves credit, tbh. got vaccine done. They're use pushing goalposts. live 40% population vaxed, hugher rate vax would make situation safer cannot get vaxed.

Maybe people send complaints CDC instead blaming vaccinated, fault? groups can‚Äôt get vaccines gather time seems like bad idea, period.

Elder care homes killers reason. live Ontario crossed border times 2019 specifically go Trader Joe‚Äôs, last time went border guard didn‚Äôt believe thought ulterior motive lmao dude love TJs swear I‚Äôll cry go Yes, low. bank daughter's life ""low"". someone claims vaccinated lies it?

Im doctor hope helps bit much resentment/anger amongst Canadians this? seen Americans Americans? 110 people died per day 2018.. automobile accidents. much too? Right, like least far liberals, majority pretty much fully board ""follow recommendations experts"" far restrictions, mask policies, everything else. looking like people, never really expert opinion, science, seems like way oppose conservatives. experts recommending something makes harder make distinction whose liberally following guidelines, whose conservative thought restrictions excessive, there's group people throwing fit. ridiculous childish. Almost three million people die US every year. Flu deaths range 250-750 per day depending year severity season. second time likely catching first time. anti bodies gone)

Antibodies aspect immunity, there's Memory Cells even important. never met brother law...his ""girlfriend"" husband still sees. BiL paid mortgage car payment one occasion. convinced max several credit cards get personal loan.

No amount talking convince taking cleaners. ""She *loves* *love* her!""  idea state needs equal representation outdated concept used bolster states slaves. fully vaccinated Canadian living US, would really nice able see family first time year without needing quarantine two weeks.  Oh god! OK? unsanitary dangerous.  Yeah, also 50% sub suddenly become ‚Äúimmunocompromised‚Äù? CDC focused little intently making guidance unvaccinated children, vaccinated. Vaccinated people ones need guidance we're ones causing problems. Kinda like sudden people sub posting know people fully vaccinated caught covid hospital. 

It‚Äôs totally coincidence stories start getting posted soon mask requirements lifted vaccinated people. 

Totally suspicious woke morning saw tree. woods yet. loser showing probably lying she'll left alone true! mean enough data anyone justified fear. doctors specifically said seen anything make concerned. ""isn't enough data"" accept mean there's cause alarm people.

But again, that's specifically suggested talk doctor instead assuming they're risk. Mine said I'm comfortable following CDC guidelines. reservations situation, that's determine. mean assume every person UC/Chrons autoimmune disease verge death walk home.

We've 14 months vaccines given 100+ million people US yet hear specifically there's increased risk us. assume be? That's small sample size included group certainly thousands immunosuppressed individuals.

But hey, privy specific enlightening info, means share it.  ""Because honor system ain't working here, think going work lot parts country,"" said local mayor, providing literally zero evidence support assumption stop CNN reporting like true. Well tbh even though I‚Äôm fully Vaccinated I‚Äôm still thinking reason meeting fully vaccinated friend outdoors indoors still unsafe due breakthrough cases mixed messaging. I‚Äôm also concerned vaccines lose effectiveness start over. CDC says hang fully vaccinated individuals outdoors indoors don‚Äôt know that‚Äôs safe anymore variants. someone clarify this? Fair point, case end 35 infected instead 100. There's getting around fact majority Americans immunity Covid activities risk year ago significantly less risky today. estimates used justify lockdowns that‚Äôs would happen weren‚Äôt lockdowns. isn‚Äôt hard comprehend put fox news sippy-cup. ""don't let guard down"" ""impending doom"" convey two different scenarios IMO. what‚Äôll happen next they‚Äôll recover still downplay didn‚Äôt die, they‚Äôll say antibodies don‚Äôt need vaccine (even though vaccine antibodies stronger last longer). 

Not mention many people spread meantime people people spread etc. etc. etc. We've played? Jesus Christ, man. I'd tell find grip reality I'm afraid fingers left believe this. Actually enough said. live South Florida large swathe southern population vaxxed/masked till least. sure Florida rural, might well Alabama, city aight.  need select Ohio citizens random, show door $1m check get prove immunized. Make admit camera, lose $1m. expect fear missing $1m even stronger pulled immunized roles. news would run first time someone missed people like WTF... We've stopped death! Humans win! F\* nature!

Person meeting: ‚ÄúWell, there‚Äôs actually lot data, as‚Äî‚Äú

Does federal government want herd immunity? Ohio literally given answer STILL hasn‚Äôt National response. hard ask Powerball something similar? Oklahoma testing, uneducated ""christian nationalist"" governor followed dj's hate rhetoric. state full ""privatized"" religious schooled idiots, can't seem stay business. hate racism Oklahoma, nothing changes. Thank you. think cause spikes. 

There's 2 types people pandemic: follow mandates don't. followed mask mandates continue using masks they're vaccinated. follow mandates already following it. it'll roughly amount people wearing masks be. bullshit mean actually underreported, yeah, right. them, oh yes, absolutely. Happy see America recovering. Love India. First all, one flip flopped masks since beginning pandemic know spread want people hoard (like always do) masks hospitals needed most. knew spread, hospitals covered, masks masks masks always masks. new science come out, like outdoor transmission, surface transmission, we've updated guidelines recommendations accordingly. facts.

Civil constitutional rights shit on? Please tell rights shit on. start spouting personal freedoms, personal freedoms pretty much window personal actions chance infect kill others unwillingly. We're global pandemic, let's act greater good instead self bit, yeah? matter *real* mortality rate is, millions millions people dead disease that's overall pretty easily preventable stop selfish assholes minute.

Wear piece cloth, keep distance, stay home bit. That's somehow much country. pretty goddamn sad country mobilized World War II country, within single generation, tore apart airborne particle three ply pieces cloth. Think second. mean, truly, think it. feel absolutely ridiculous country, know tell you.

If we'd come together done country beginning, could barely hold together two weeks, months, we'd Thanksgiving. are, year later, finally making progress. We've purgatory year stop going bar. bear horrid inconvenience goddamn mask. Unreal. Seriously....why?  agree counts Murphy. He's dragging feet good reason. 60% adults total population I'm also working remote. agree everything said. would companies want limit labor pool exists within hour office? Open hiring broader pool.

It's important remember cuts ways. makes lot easier outsource office jobs cheap, too. I'm going say I'm *worried*, make sure resume always date case... 1. Get flu shot

2. Wear masks public places first weeks every January carry hand sanitizer

:o totally get that. really hope clarify soon. extrapolate thoughts burden public, outlaw alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana, etc.

We ""extrapolate"" anything different things need different solutions. Alcohol cigarette. drinking give someone else second-hand liver damage. driving drunk negatively affect people, already outlawed. Helping prevent people drinking death something feel could better that's slippery slope can't go there. Liberty dies grand feature small nibble there. Much like frog slowly turn heat pan realize cooked.

Yes, slippery slope fallacy. assuming lot happen painting scary picture real support actually case. Going protecting people pandemic people personal liberties (or ""cooked"" say) quite tall order. possible someone make kids get vaccinated covid without parents approval, like minors states get birth control without parents consent? Would real help anti vaxxers parents. ""enteral ventilation"" ....

&amp;nbsp;

a nice way saying ""blowing O2 butt""... may held position based numbers March, said recently, 16 year old approved receive vaccine? 

Higher case numbers unvaccinated teen vs lower case numbers vaccinated teen = changed facts, changed position.  know people US sub, anyone else growing concern looking posts lot downplaying masks variants?  


I mean yea okay guys got vaccinated, mean can't pass someone infect them.  


Are mods enough monitor posts here? Fauci gets credit vaccine distribution deserves lot blame initial response.  I‚Äôve seen lot parents raging recently. I‚Äôm curious parents continue grandstanding kids vaccinated even though every child US vaccinated time theirs. guess slip shadows re-emerge maskless, conveniently forgetting ever making big deal first place. 

Anxiously waiting spicy hypocrisy rear head.  EXACTLY. Really sad kid get upvoted end saying post-COVID19 effects body. lot pre-prints. Canadians fully vaccinated cannot. makes ton sense. Praying guys recover soon well. keeps prefacing everything instances mask free. masks bars, indoor restaurants, concerts, baseball games? I‚Äôd like information. I'm making anything seem like anything. I'm CDC said do. listen recommendations Anonymous folk internet believe somehow know better.  goal turn COVID regular flu. That‚Äôs nonsense you‚Äôre less likely get second time. understand test positive Covid months recovery, that's question. question minimum might test positive. son confirmed positive 5/13 via nasal rapid test. symptoms low grade fever, runny nose, cough heart rate seems spike fairly easily. high enough concerned blood oxygen fine. fever since 5/16. sister developed bad sore throat cough. tested 5/15 cheek swab PCR test came back negative. checked yesterday cheek swab PCR test rule false positive/negative came back negative today. 
If worst symptoms, positive test would almost relief since build antibodies. son testing negative yesterday, would soon already negative? looking less accurate cheek swab difference? hate keep testing him, peace mind would good too.  curiosity, parents buy kid-sized N95 equivalents? get online industrial suppliers even Amazon. retailers stock since surges receded. young people stupid believe whatever B.S. sounds best. 

Add freebies simpletons. Yah, well, state fewer total cases deaths... welcome. also important get tested right away feel symptoms, earlier treatment better. 

Your state's health department information treatments available, since infusion simple injection. Get vaccinated! 60% adults, 50% total population. Still great numbers though, considering vaccines five months now. right? makes thankful choice Moderna Pfizer every illness known man, definitely illness symptoms established psychological disorder manifests frequently exact demographic that‚Äôs likely suffer said disorder. brought facts. poor logic bad science.

There single study showing masks 100 percent effective even close.

Then never read single study topic  ""My personal anecdote important mountains scientific evidence."" Honestly, 20s trying figure world. 30s confident person. understand world, kinda works. Also take glorious naps. take car someplace really need go points time? that's dangerous.  done county many establishments hard.

What I‚Äôm less patient willing interject it‚Äôs obvious someone calculating risk based incorrect data (understated vaccine efficacy, exaggerated death rates, etc).  don‚Äôt know numbers above, think 50s started getting vaccinated recently, good amount older people still waiting second shot, may leave vulnerable hospitalization. seems they‚Äôre going speed second shots 50 variant. understanding AZ isn‚Äôt effective don‚Äôt wait long time shots, may also complicate things.  real life, they're different vaccine uptake. cable news. comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Seriously, re-read thread understand making sense. feels like want admit right something even know point. Agreed. affluent parts Houston, everyone still wears mask. Poorer areas city, suburbs, rural areas totally different story. Went 0 100 end No, line thinking entire field psychiatry works. Last heard Newsom going follow CDC guidelines dropping masks vaccinated people June 15. Maybe large venues &amp; schools require remainder year, curious think masks remainder year? Give break. like 0.001% population. plenty reasons frustrated getting vaccine, need invent fake ones. great news hope keeps up. I'm worried non-vaxxed people assume dont need get vaxxed since everything ""normal"" vaccinated people dont wear masks (and anti-vax continue wear masks). I'm worried winter look like. vast majority said would another year, experts suprised new CDC guidance.

Right? caught off-guard; that's worst part it. opinion, released timeline governments businesses could integrate reopening plans. 

As stands, essential workers tasked mask police suddenly become vaccine police well.  tools disposal vaccination verification? floppy, easily counterfeited record card, *the honor system.* 

Knowing none easy anyone, still going SMH CDC longer. There's ""herd"" immunity individual immunity. full vaccinations 95% individual immunity. 

Which aint nothing. still large number Americans getting first vaccine every week. actually bumped week 12 year olds vaccinated, go week 12 year olds vaccinated. We're still getting well 2 million first doses weekly.

The media wants take downtic make seem like cavernous plummet. People getting easier friends turn zombies. It‚Äôs likely someone works hospital encounter one breakthrough case. It‚Äôs incredibly unlikely regular person would encounter several. Ah youre saying dont need maaasks. Sweet. Looks like time stand within 6 feet everybody cough general direction w uncovered mouth!

Also, guaranteeing purchases pharmaceutical companies reasonable prices lets invest additional capacity. 

India Modi claimed conquered COVID without vaccines never tried hard coordinate mass purchase production vaccines 2020.  f-in clue trying say incoherent rant, read examples prove point.

The article talk all. onyl chart discusses first doses total first doses given, trends anything. Given source CDC CDC shows us first doses go up, fine saying botched reporting?

I mean, I'm really even sure got chart green bars. guess back-fill eliminated increase (see note data revised) look CDC chart total doses, there's increase ~May 5th May 11th. Probably not, rural hospitals area send Covid ICU patients nearest medium large city. someone making ‚Äúkids immune compromised folks‚Äù argument, here‚Äôs reasoning.

1. every parent easily leave kids home go get groceries. parents single can‚Äôt leave child spouse. places don‚Äôt offer delivery curbside, charge unreasonably high fee. especially true rural areas. would also concern immune compromised.

2. Children sacrificed LOT last year. doesn‚Äôt seem reasonable tell basically return lockdown get exposed. seems far reasonable IMO require adults mask kids safely go places.

3. Many states dropping mandates schools. Others kept mandates schools finding mandates gone everywhere else, anti mask crowd starts pushing back hard schools. drop mandates schools, forcing kids high risk conditions choose education health. high risk kids access vaccine, isn‚Äôt big concern, aren‚Äôt quite yet.

For really boils feeling asking healthy adults wear mask much smaller burden asking children risk exposure every day. truly way enforce vaccinated adults going mask-free, would onboard that, don‚Äôt. idea someone getting really sick close frustrating. It‚Äôs like tripping right finish line. make someone degenerate?

-NY Times agreeing you. know lot people said lot things, got vaccinated turn.

The antivax friend whose kids vaccines got one last month. see playing town surrounding areas. Anti-mask/anti-lockdown movements seem tied right side political spectrum, ontario currently run conservative government people still protesting. People ready protest like government even would typically align political spectrum. functionally went 

1. Vaccines normally take long time develop 1 year highly unlikely even though Trump promising this.
2. Trump says ""go faster"" 
3. Actual scientists work day night find breakthroughs required create vaccine year.
4. Somehow Trump gets credit saying ""go faster"" denying every anti-covid measure? Funny anti-maskers would say ""well business's right refuse serve someone"" gay couple wants wedding cake bigoted bakery refuses, can't see irony they're getting violently angry business shows door wearing mask. teens going today!  They‚Äôre irritated might feel like crud, I‚Äôm happy add another layer protection family. makes difference children. harms children unvaccinated vaccinated NPR soft hitting attempts upsetting anyone. It‚Äôs hardly league.

There‚Äôs reason aren‚Äôt known breaking much news. last time about? I'm honestly asking. live Dallas I've weekend mask usage like 10% people I'm seeing inside places.

It good before, recent CDC guidance, I've seen many businesses stop requiring masks immediately mask wearing plummeted. that's actually closed? restrictions masks months now. Fair. like ""sputnik v? thanks, I'll wait moderna/pfizer."". took 2-3 months change mind (and lot googling, talking friends etc) I'm hally got yesterday. (But overcoming fear was...Realllly hard) ""So there's actually zero deaths?!?""

""No, we're reporting it"" Frankly, another failure public health policy. cooties stigmatized playgrounds across country decades. encourages children become infected hide infections peers, including members opposite sex, greatly increasing risk they're putting children at. Additionally, false accusations children cause possible cases missed adults assume children simply ""crying wolf."" 

I hope we've seen last year, finally get relevant agencies make progress eradicating hidden plague.   California Building Code (CBC) requires signs public pools follows: 
A sign letters least 1 inch (25 mm) high language diagram clearly stated shall posted entrance area public pool **which states persons currently active diarrhea active diarrhea within previous 14 days shall allowed enter pool water.** 

How propose businesses local govt leaders ensure people follow advice? hope end year guys done Covid. 

I hope spike ends days weeks. lived New York NY‚Äôs awful spike entire US‚Äô spike. friends Brazil talked daily spike. It‚Äôs awful depressing could even worse India. sorry see guys going it, hope beat back quickly possible cause need help vaccinating world.

Be safe, friend. Ahem. Masks, social distancing, lockdowns isolation done centuries ago. main way controlled early diseases. Although science behind never understood back then. state (Oregon) 8 deaths weekend, 3 largest counties zero. deaths get tend counties lower vaccination rates.

Vaccines work. needs happen Biden originally said 70 percent July 4th. stuck instead caving  dunno US voters, I'm Canada referring Canadians know. incredibly unlikely they'll eligible time fully vaccinated October 1st

Why? Vaccines son lol, oh, told her. 

She like... ‚Äúso even think virus big deal anyways!?‚Äù 

I blinked twice replied:
- friend high school one first 100 people country die COVID. 34. found news.
- mother (is critical care nurse, and) got COVID first positive patient interacted with. gave father. ill 2+ months.
- sister lives works NYC. also got COVID. hospital block lives Queens bodies stacked outside. parents really upset worried couldn‚Äôt go her. Thankfully, everyone since recovered. Yeah sort job know difference! used able to. lack skills desire. masks public places first weeks every January carry hand sanitizer

I like going, wonder Januari spikes everywhere simultaniously? Probably right? 

Someone probably knows Well put. Anyone reasonable actually reads [Vegan Society's definition understands taking vaccines falls ""as far possible practicable"" exception. Massachusetts here. friend mine freaked Facebook wrong lift restrictions EVERYONE (yes, everyone clarified) vaccine Covid FULLY recovered.

Like, holy shit. understand hesitancy bit. requirements completely impossible never going happen, saying you‚Äôll accept nothing less. people really delusional risks return normalcy. India variants different variants we've seen. unique combination mutations found variants. seen real life studies yet lab studies antibodies indicate respond worse variants Wow, states restrictions deaths, makes think ü§î  you? things sure seems different am. 
August see EU travel back usual, arent vaccinated expect test requirement dont understand R levels viruses   100%. never gonna big thing US individualist culture I‚Äôm hoping see reduction cold season. still need remind people wash hands I‚Äôm probably setting disappointed lol problem anyone choosing remain masked. That's oversimplified. Abbott dropped mask mandate could even get vaccine (36yo male). wife high risk still waiting get turn too. weeks mandate everyone finally got chance get vaccinated. April 22nd got second shot contacted immediately opened everyone. month mask mandate many people vaccinated.

At moment, anyone wanted vaccine could gotten one now. lot people vaccines. silly continue mask mandate. CDC announced it, seemed bit premature, trust guidence it. Part is, get vaccine, still told wear mask, get vaccine horror stories. lifting mask requirements recommendations vaccinated people encourages people get vaccines, important masks right now.

I know ""those people"" I'm sure people want mask forever that's fine, there's definitely reasons bad idea back March we're much different spot now. Yeah, handled well despite almost beat still lead world cases deaths. Really well handled. handling well letting run across country idiots conspire, getting lot vaccines country wealthy sure amazing. Successfully made fun lazy friend set vaccine appointment. Sometimes roasting works lol. seeing last week went up?

7 day rolling average done nothing go since early April. (This seen CDC links/charts posted)

Unless talking daily posts comments Rueters article involves reporting delays number shots reported sorts weird artifacts. That‚Äôs completely reasonable me. require sort special hour risk people priority/free curbside pickups.  we'll migrate /r/rhinovirus complain rest common cold cured?

DeSantis go hell.  Medlife Crisis UK doctor youtuber Indian descent. video covering situation talking doctors two weeks ago: asked followers made video thought could anything really add conversation myself, several people, talked good information source going  reasonable keeping masking rules essential places vulnerable people shop like grocery stores pharmacies? Non-essential places whatever want since vulnerable persons make call whether visit bars theme parks knowing risk. know Texas, Germany 19 people 19 years old died since start pandemic. Go it. show said this? see CDC tracker listing 583k covid deaths currently can't find source saying say. worry, bunch dudes high school posted facebook hoax anyway bodies must've washed reason.  Best loosen export laws. go one anyway. genius really. Change motivation get vaccine empathy motivation selfishness, bingo.

I'd love see demographics people actually play lottery. would willing bet large crossover refuse get COVID vaccine. many kids age 18 died? know? miracle modern medicine. think many fellow Americans still stupid get vaccinated. article wrong Arizona. zero deaths reported literally every week bc apparently stats people take weekends off. look 7 day rolling average it‚Äôs literally unchanged since mid March ~10/day. I‚Äôd highly suspicious article‚Äôs information. Yeah, noticed responded. Funny one letter do. AZ J&amp;J available MRNA whenever arrive.

Apparently can't problem pull ole Ostrich head ground trick. month's ago handful cases J&amp;J's vaccine quick find answers calm people immunocompromise individuals care. ""main goal"" pandemic shifts whatever new narrative want continue mandates place.

It's really infuriating. get gone ""flatten curve prevent hospitals getting overwhelmed!"" ""literally COVID spread unacceptable"", I'm someone COVID policies last year.

I personally think CDC waited lifted mask mandate entirely June, goalpost moving see people defending maintaining mask mandate ridiculous. According Bloomberg we've hit 1.5 Billion worldwide doses!

The world reach 7 day average 25M according Bloomberg, doubt reach 33M/day 2nd half next month, unless India picks pace China did. hate everyone talking ‚Äúnot first one‚Äù like never gonna first one point millions ahead fine months fake. It‚Äôs fake man made virus. effects however, real. I'm worried main state mentioned article Texas... anti mask anti vax going go, ""See? need things!"" actually pretty surprised Georgia worse Dakotas Nebraska. I'm fairly certain word ""surge"" post originally bad. we're talking surge yes right, summer. true lol, vaccines didn‚Äôt even exist 150 years ago. kidding? worked right going get second shot. sure hydrate, every workout. Bummer CDC already claimed April 9th 345,000 deaths covid underlying cause. 35,000 deaths covid contributing cause. admittance there's 130,000 excess deaths reasons. Delta gets avoid that. 

Their current staff merely ""encouraged"" get shot. New staff must chosen get shot they'll even hire them. Neither group protected OSHA policy adverse reactions. COVID vaccines haven‚Äôt passed phase 3 &amp; 4 clinical trials aren‚Äôt approved human use would two great reasons make different. One case make surge. Florida, Texas, Arizona (Southern) California (and probably elsewhere) dramatic rises cases starting mid-June 2020. speculated time people spending time indoors A/C due weather (no idea backed up).

*Edit noticed first post ""sure cases"" ""surge cases"" may cause confusion. Man it‚Äôs gonna feel weird over. better worse, think pandemic gonna collective conscience years come SW Florida trumpers conspiracy nuts. excuse Gov gave go ahead masks came off. Hey man, said napkin math, give break.

LOL fixed it. literally typed ""18 weeks today"" google. idea got 18 instead 28. really seen CDC basing recommendations ""popularity"". Maybe missed everyone complaining telling us wear mask? first time put mask, transported back 25 strangled death (my heart stopped minute) guy towel, lead pretty pervasive PTSD flashbacks make sob floor least day work. flashbacks start put dont abate till take off, no, hasnt gotten better past year. 


The last year change Hell me, like get dr's note, cant give virus dr's note infect me, Im high risk three different issues. Im vaccinated two weeks that, unless law SAYS wear mask, Im done reliving hell. think really cares? scoring political points Republican base. Restrictions fall everywhere, writing wall, way say ""look me, ended tyranny own"". peer pressure here.  I‚Äôve looked too. Mid June cases began climb. temperature drives ppl back inside. 

Hopefully, amount ppl vaccinated, much surge. think Canadians driving. all. Like probably would've helpful back said, apparently one- including government- realized valid reason. inadvisable hard workout hours (Pfizer) vaccine? I‚Äôm going sick days really want get workout in. ‚ÄúMetric increases?‚Äù Cases, hospitalizations, deaths dropping there. understanding safetiness vaccine established months ago, Along data 100M vaccinated already.

Is kind unknown factor 12s possess? I'm curious know precedent cases 12s significant reaction (or unreaction) vaccination absent rest population. personally call lottery ""stupid tax."" yeah, tax hope probably nicer way put it. best way evaluate claims look excess deaths.

You typically find graphs many people die normal year compare many dying 2020 2021 get (reasonably) good idea true death toll Corona.

I easily find one India, one pulled news image/article outdated, obviously pay attention anything week 38. find recent ones want, goal give idea what's going India concerned getting updated US numbers.

But main take away point see previous years generally *very* consistent 2020 total deaths (and therefore also excess deaths) *way* up.

The nice thing using excess deaths can't really hide behind claims doctors hospitals lying. hard hide anything using excess deaths fact, almost data manipulation *undercount* excess deaths. Meaning using excess deaths give us conservative number deaths reality actually almost certainly least little bit Corona deaths excess deaths shows us.

2020 2021 far away normal reasonable assume extra deaths came anything except Corona. would actually expect deaths *lower* 2020 2021 people sitting home lot instead going things.

Less going bars drinking, less drinking driving, less sports, less travel, less driving work, less deaths contagious diseases like flu, etc.

So actually highly certain excess deaths *still* undercounting true deaths Corona.

Ok, explain concept excess deaths good measure. Next question, India's excess deaths situation look like?

Here article talks excess deaths India (and countries).

http://www.healthdata.org/special-analysis/estimation-excess-mortality-due-covid-19-and-scalars-reported-covid-19-deaths

Use Ctrl f ""India"" skip relevant parts. tl:dr based total mortality/excess deaths, India likely reporting 1/3 true Corona death count.

India recorded 248,000 deaths Corona, based excess deaths definitely closer 737,000. Apparently point near someone recently got vaccinated cause infertility, biggest load shit I've ever heard. people don‚Äôt even know care it‚Äôs coming tbh ridiculous? Gotta think stupid know get stupid people buy in. believe antivaxxers getting infected good thing accelerate herd immunity. one cases privilege levels charts. US one absolute first nations vaccinate people even taking advantage immense opportunity need bribed money. Infection rates dropping significantly, hospitals/health care facilities even close overwhelmed fact quite stable. main goal pandemic achieved, patients need bed able get one without delay (minus issues unrelated Covid, health insurance etc.). 40% people get symptoms. one 60% get symptoms mild.  shot far worse. call sick next day spent entire day bed flu-like symptoms never happened shot I've ever had. something need antibodies already felt pressured getting want limited things like travel events. 

This mandatory. want chance right. Yep! shame it'll take alot longer US get 75% :/  Yeah, tomorrow sounds *somewhat* reasonable. That's NY CT's reopenings take effect. actually shocked senior rates still going pace are. 65+ hit 90% summer keep rate up. also worrisome metric increases recently.

And exactly would be? go concerts like might awhile.  indian employee (in states) says it‚Äôs show/propaganda hospitals doctors get money covid cases regular hospital business.
   
This bullshit ""a nurse know"" saying USA year ago. Seemed like everyone trying downplay covid knew specific nurse... diabetes immune compromised. 35 million diabetics US. Around 100 million Americans high blood pressure. Many millions risky health conditions. That's lot people impression protected vaccine really aren't. highest totals cases, deaths. 3rd highest cases deaths YESTERDAY.

Third highest population country. would expect FL third place?


Also **rates** metrics falling weeks. Raw numbers irrelevant point.


FL currently 20th case rate 27th death rate nationwide. please don‚Äôt let facts get way agenda. am
Hoping announced tomorrow take effect Friday. Worst case next Friday. government controlling population giving citizens free money? pandemic soon lost jobs coming back. sentiments going outside seem absurd. Outside actually one places felt safe long masked socially distanced. Remember J&amp;J getting approved gonna gamechanger üòê read article posting it? Genius? 
 
including official detailed CDC review? 
 
from CDC review ""association vaccination hospitalization SNF population might limited generalizability."" 
 
now well aware could die single thunder thunderstorm tell move underground bunker rest life good. 
 
but tell ""everybody"" move underground bunker thunders happen stop life planet know I'd called ""irresponsible"" seems like cases nowhere go down, that's decision made. cases continue downward trajectory, 100 deaths day nationally months. get every flu season deaths like that.

The CDC got feel collateral damage masks low, could convince part hesitant get program. also put abrupt end the, ""If vaccines work, masks?"" trolls overnight. (Which immediately replaced parents kids 12 immunocompromised people screaming vaccinated people must wear masks unvaccinated untrustworthy.) Unfortunately nothing moved much today. WoW comparison especially bad last Tuesday's numbers abnormally good compared typical Tuesdays (which always bad day).

7 day moving average back February. Expected still disappointing hoping would least see slight flattening downtrend 12-15 data came (even though tiny group). OP here. read Janee, loved it, upvotes.

Permit add. people age, get mellower, less self-centered, concerned real values life. One best friends I've known since 1959 (wait long life view!) gone every class reunion. since 2009. Roger told age 40 dropped egos.

What last one? :) going buy concert tickets GRiZ, fucker sold *literally* soon went on-sale. Right? feel like pure laziness standpoint (let alone many reasons) it‚Äôs far easier get vaccine go effort finding buying fake vaccine card. Well clearly conversation isn‚Äôt helpful anyone. nice day take care. article month ago. continued monitor data come conclusion risk spread vaccinated individual extremely low. low Fauci said Sunday need wear mask fully vaccinated asymptomatic covid.  
  
Given evidence have, unreasonable continue expect vaccinated individuals mask unnecessarily.  LOL, feel like caught too! heard interview. TBH, source original post. several NPR programs. NPR seems one places hear directly true experts instead talking heads politicians agendas scientific fact. Yup. came California Nurses Association union. claiming it‚Äôs ‚Äúbig blow safety nurses frontline workers‚Äù. feel strongly safety surely vaccinated? missing something here? vaccinated protected. screams another union power grab like teachers unions California.  convince (very cautious, moderately high risk) parents order Indian food? They're afraid Indian variant avoiding Indian restaurants abundance caution, matter try convince mentality paranoid, unnecessary, frankly little offensive, pretty hard get budge.

Any suggestions do? interesting. come finance. admit MUCH likely go business require masks. nice mess it. Yep. found conservative family member quickly shared social media. love garbage. 

Interestingly, really go along principle ""small business"", ""personal liberty"" ""business rights"" IMO, I'm sure I'm lib reading lib conspiracies, right? Never heard FL TX? Same. We‚Äôre control think I‚Äôm sure ever be. think that‚Äôs good thing, ultimately, consider state environment damage human race capable of, like said, extremely humbling.  Around mass vaccinations school sites hours started monday. need another week numbers really kick in. no, 'wantasspics', Yay! step right path Virginia! ...found antibody levels fell certain point children previously infected, greater risk severe dengue disease infected. fact, children whose antibodies fell within low range ‚Äî sort anti-sweet spot ‚Äî risk nearly eight times higher children. contrast, higher antibody levels protective severe belief low levels antibodies cannot neutralize kill invading viruses. bind effectively usher susceptible cells, viruses replicate. thought Andrew Wakefield person really got vaccine conspiracy theories going? vaccine? Yeah fine. No, related adult session Indeed. personally, pandemic humbling many ways. good thing. there's many people think know better one worlds top government health organizations.

those people much better anti vaxxers anti maskers mindset. different beliefs.

perhaps made mistakes acted quickly before, still trust guy reddit. They‚Äôve reverted back old template numbers. Makes easier compare. 

1,123,306 administered

124,455,693 fully vaccinated (37.5% total, 44.4% 12+ 47.6% 18+)

39,814,006 seniors (72.5%)

J&amp;J numbers dont seem moved much. shall make greatest tones. body living microcosm added metal distortion! become Kevin Shields. That's differ. risk tolerance higher I'm fine 95%. self defense vaccine mask. No, literally evidence far vaccines effective mutations people vaccine spread COVID.

Being ""thoughtful others"" counts actual tangible benefit. want vaccinated people wear masks selfish reason vaccinated people want wear masks: satisfies concerns/desires. vaccinated people, feel job already, feel like deserve wear masks. case, paranoid want feel secure, think others accommodate that. 

That's entirely is, try paint ""thoughtful others"". tangible benefit move makes feel comfortable. population density help.. think weather helps lot too.. even Winter warm enough gather outside. Summer weather settled people outside much possible. guy Federal government, he's fact opposition runs local government Delhi. still dumb thing say. Lol... Americans fucking insane, regard lives others. 800 cases still lot people hospitalized going broke, maybe slightly less tragically dying. reason care, right? 600 cases per day 220k deaths per year, well outside flu season territory. We'd need 150 deaths per day flu season range. Yeah. I'm trying figure -- likely what'll happen bunch AZ doses expiring June dont want waste . got first AZ dose April. might get notified book second dose AZ leave get Pfizer i'm weighing risks/rewards. suppose turns three months they're saying ""it's effective slow spreading variant"" i'll mix-match time. I'm trying make sure make Vegas trip november, looking better month.  Ill honest. Tampa whole nother world. Good cuban sammies though.  miss part mRNA vaccines development decades, developing Covid literally simple dragging dropping spike protein genome, care? could probably make fucking 5 dose vaccine that's weak practically useless, would still cry ir. Canada reach pretty soon excellent progress making. thanks that.

well said Really I‚Äôve seen reverse. lot ‚Äúif don‚Äôt want force vaccinated people wear masks don‚Äôt care children/immunocompromised die‚Äù. couple years fervently new thing Take look nytimes article. scientific evidence unclear. punishing. It‚Äôs thoughtful others time need opportunity cost quite low. people followed mask mandates point live. see maybe 30% masked, probably realize county vaccinated 21% population unlikely get many more. Cases slowly rising. explained u Bruce Lee expert immunology. especially like NBC article calling ""Fact check"" they've effectively determined miracles exist matter fact. That's incredible. vatican especially thrilled scientists worked catholic, considered sainthood. Yea.. dumb people gonna dumb. guy team people pays come ways shitty think it‚Äôs hard metric look at. 280 died mask mandates lockdowns. 30% US adult population taking vaccine mask mandates dropping, kids definitely going exposed way previously. Yes exactly this. must protect children: anti-mask anti-vax idiots MUST wear mask  Really poorly written article presents data, kinda asserts weird general things peer pressure people might experiencing. single specific anecdote referenced.  
  
If vaccinated, feel safe remove mask. don't! Everyone free make choice feel necessary risk tolerance. looked y'all's numbers much better. \~250 new cases per day there. Though vaccination numbers worse around cases far better. I'm guessing population density making major difference. likelyhood astrazeneca vaccine still quite effective preventing severe disease death. may underperform regards preventing mild moderate illness studies must done.

the chinese vaccne siphoram already shown lackluster even wild variant Chile Seyelles, however death rate continues low compared infection rate. Can't report deaths there's one left alive.  It‚Äôs good question. don‚Äôt know. variants changing significantly contagious, don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth taking chance. Well one lot closer entire country rely govt income. Tons jobs available one wants work govt providing good unemployment. Look man long story short afraid country someday going look exactly like china CCP scares shit me. Rome built day step take toward dependence govt another peice puzzle. must protect children : anti-mask anti-vax idiots MUST wear mask eet! Make awesome tones you‚Äôre fully vaccinated!! quite right - read article.   not. things miracles. reason takes long get vaccine approved typically go lengthy exhausting approval process. waived understood time 'fact check' made. hard invoke 'miracle' get done way half dozen companies would simultaneously developed version. Lol yeah wasnt supposed covid vaccine microchip diagram boss metal zone something? I'm plug guitar belly button work. ridiculous. easily eliminate quarantine vaccinated people proper testing protocol. couple airlines tried sort thing got attacked ""anti mother"" family something partial immunity combined SA variants slower spread may keep bay. Hopefully keep bay international travel, honestly see countries can't make vaccine passport make mandate vaccinated come country. think would better encourage Canadian businesses getting income via tourism setting high bar open up.

I think Hawaii planning implementing something like within next month two, I'm sure Trudeau's policy necessarily right one. Actually that‚Äôs I‚Äôm saying. number people US unvaccinated enforcement mechanism proving shot doesn‚Äôt, portion take advantage continue spread virus. That‚Äôs encouraged mask mandate lifted. It‚Äôs idiotic policy people take advantage of. also‚Äî kids cannot yet get vaccinated don‚Äôt seem get sick, whole, spread virus. And, read up, actually don‚Äôt know whether vaccinated people may able spread virus, although likelihood seems low. could change variants develop. point takes little protect vulnerable people, require essential businesses? course study. early data shows looks like vaccines protect well weeks confirmed. official line been, don‚Äôt evidence issue stop opening (another step happened Monday) things may change time final restrictions lifted (June).

One example evidence infections (in one area) variant 60s higher 60+ (more likely vaccinated). good idea costs money (not using store hours efficiently) So... good luck. get fired 101.  Honestly I'm usually fan profile stalking, uncovers think vaccine going cause auto immune disorders, well worth effort. probably get vaccine, honestly. favor convince people actually know real life get trust stupid monkey brain scientists. Pretty close good you‚Äôre going get. Don‚Äôt lick strangers, you‚Äôre basically good go. Maybe, im expert. flu also lot less contagious Maybe don‚Äôt want article propaganda.   think you‚Äôre misunderstanding comparison making Yes, factors change impact virus, vary state. doesn‚Äôt mean make direct comparisons states determine states need higher rates vaccination.

Instead, correct comparison outcomes higher rates vs lower rates within state. And, yes, states higher vaccination rates better outcomes state would vaccination.rate we‚Äôre lower. matter slice it, higher percentage unvaccinated COVID-naive people are, potential hosts available continue spread. love PBS? New Hour fantastic Daly news show. say Canadian CBC fan. feel like people play lottery don‚Äôt think far people get covid multiple times, herd immunity getting covid feasible without mass casualties. comment history shows kind confrontational person enjoy online. You‚Äôre worth time energy, love block feature Reddit. 

Byeeee. Good. two kids there. recourse without looking worse, announce. 

If announce get caught, look bad. announce turn India, look 100x worse. start quarantining people without saying anything, look 1000x worse. understand, consider low enough risk bother go. even antivax, feeling need. 

Make vaccine compulsory go back school enroll college, suddenly feel need. mean, cool know long term effects all! new development insane see data tell us +5, +10, +20... 

:). genie let bottle, good luck getting back next several months. going take multiple deaths packed ICUs several months overcome intertia put measure place again. course half states still refuse anything even inevitable high profile deaths going happen. post astonishingly ironic given vaccine neither stops contracting transmitting virus. Additionally efficacy vaccine dependent another persons status. Oh okay usual shit hole states never visit anyways. Sorry New Orleans, vacation year... man learned CTRL-C &amp; CTRL-V today Absolutely. think people automatically think vaccine hesitancy, means believe covid. However there's plenty people afraid both. fact, know anyone believe covid. people know gotten vaccine afraid long term side effects lazy. Texas people outdoors right come summer spend time indoors. Yet still ""only"" flu winter. I've never understood reasoning. used see therapist, one while. tried getting new one last year pandemic making much worse. wait list 8 months Kaiser. finally got week moved state, losing Kaiser week. 

I literally worst health coverage known man. $8000 deductible literally nothing covered hit deductible. 

But still can't accept offer. money. afford it, made priority since life hectic move. need anything prioritize search therapist new area.  Oh definitely. I'll surprised lose anti-vax father due COVID end this. everything better Canada ‚ù§Ô∏è  That‚Äôs great, like that.

I mean wife wearing masks well past June. Schools always required vaccinations students. get shot privately think helps parade around saying need masks shots.

Maybe there's 3d chess going on, people getting vaccinated. Byt stopped selling cards cuz dangerous ever washed faces first place üòè

/s true. N95 masks equivalents definitely protect wearer covid-19.   problem. say facts, people labeled bhakths BJP member. Modi government criticized mess leave people's behavior. go hand hand defeat surge. I'm super happy. daughter UH student, fully vaccinated many peers not. look current speed rate vaccination, end July really realistic date ending vaccination. lot people frustrated older age groups taking long time - that‚Äôs smaller supply started vaccination. Also, forget many younger people vaccinated high risk due healthcare profession, younger groups go much, much faster older groups. sound unbearable, friends favor cutting ties. People every right hesitant brand new vaccines hold them, refer antivaxers.

&amp;#x200B;

I say someone vaccinated first shot AZ Pfizer available 2 weeks later. told listen Joe Rogan he‚Äôs medical doctor‚Ä¶..so‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. CF lung transplants... dont think ever board plane populated setting without kind face covering again, least near future sure.

I personally feel COVID stay, much like flu centuries now. meds make COVID non lethal truly something like flu, chancing it. Exactly, *dangerous* agenda, boot. That's really understand. people wait situation US slightly less dumpster fire. stuff months ago, deaths still well 1000 per day barely anyone gotten vaccinated. Imagine actively organizing try convince others *less careful*, *hundreds thousands* countrymen dead.

It's sad touch humanity people gotten, guess that's world live now.  neither stops contracting transmitting virus

uhhhhh yeah get source that, pretty sure that's exactly vaccine lol different small outbreaks NZ. peak daily case load August cluster 13 quickly fell 2 4 cases day. outbreak community cluster NZ February one never 4 cases single day limited 3 families end.  cases single day entire August February outbreaks combined NZ. 

NZ population: 5,128,650 
Greater Taipei (only) population: 7,047,559 people

NZ population density: 19.0/km2 
Greater Taipei (only) population density: 2,862.7/km2 
Taipei (only) population density: means spreading silently within Taiwan lengthy period time, probably several weeks. Regular surveillance testing NZ would caught earlier. 

And escaped system. must know, individual contact-traced visitations prostitute. triggered massive test sites overnight relevant districts. Meanwhile, everybody exercise extra caution, mask up, stay home possible. That's it. Nobody's trying really struggle shut now. Melbourne took months severe lockdown get hundreds cases day zero.

Thanks learned words encouragement. Glad ok everyone else working hard keep things bay whatever resources have. whole state still mask mandate, even outdoors. Yea since celebrity get COVID‚Ä¶. step 1. make sound like bad thing

step 2. condemn american way

step 3. profit fit That‚Äôs OP claimed though. OP claimed child‚Äòs immune system resistant COVID vaccinated adult. love you‚Äôre getting downvoted this. amount people vaccinated sub could careless can‚Äôt get vaccinated amazing me. selfish anti- vaxxers. they‚Äôre ‚Äúsafe‚Äù one else matters Sprouts Yeah I‚Äôve seen people (somehow) afraid COVID Vaccine they‚Äôre kinda forced pick lesser two evils (obviously vaccine lmao)  Good! Lol, okay bud. Whatever need tell stay safe. virus going selfish arrogant idiots like you.

Do personal attacks make feel big strong? Ah. Well first comment looks like wrong chain, too. Wait, whining wanting American vaccines last five months? really don‚Äôt agree interpretation. hesitant people (not anti-vaxxers, they‚Äôre lost cause) genuinely considering benefits drawbacks personal level, trying evade government mask rules. CDC changing guidance ‚Äúyou wear mask protected matter whether you‚Äôre vaccinated not‚Äù ‚Äúyou‚Äôre safe longer threat others, mask not‚Äù meaningful anyone category, gives real incentive get vaxxed might perceived previously. Bullshit. concerned looking better China, announced many cases today.

This exponential growth similar happened country March 2020, nothing unusual it. will. Around June 10th Canada either hit 70% population least one dose (the imaginary 'herd immunity' number people often quote) us demand drops we'll onto second doses That's still months though.  Yeah, I‚Äôm aware that. doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean kids protected catching spreading it. know there‚Äôs lots data suggests kids poor carriers don‚Äôt seem infect others way adults do, haven‚Äôt seen anything says it‚Äôs equivalent vaccinated adult.  Lol sorry. thought answering someone else.  Money talks. federal government find extra cash fund absurd programs. offer incentive unvaccinated? Ahhh I'm glad live sticks. It‚Äôs also fact viruses circulating due everyone staying home, refraining normal activities, schools closed. mask isn‚Äôt magic, unless it‚Äôs well fitted N95. isn‚Äôt good thing reinforcing OCD. There‚Äôs reason it‚Äôs diagnosed illness. therapist talk to? can‚Äôt afford I‚Äôll buy year free something like better help. Honest offer. don‚Äôt want suffering Time jobs make vaccination requirement. Make mandatory schools travel via boat plane. statement possible, even probable (depending vaccine took), factual. aren‚Äôt forgotten, don‚Äôt make significant percentage experience severe illness death due particular virus. guidance available children underlying conditions, well guidance residential care facilities children (many underlying conditions). 

However, focus still elderly general adult population. major issue approving vaccine kids soon perception safety. parents perceive risk virus children extremely low (which statistically validated), perceive risk vaccine higher (which shown, pushing earlier time makes many general public think hasn‚Äôt enough time discover true risk kids), simply won‚Äôt get kids vaccinated anyways rates remain low. 

Also, (and throwing nothing really back up, take huge grain salt) think kids could gotten earlier, parents choosing vaccinate kids would resistant changing minds later time passed safety assured (almost like wanting admit wrong‚ÄîI know sounds petty, lot people kinda work like even aren‚Äôt thinking consciously). So‚Äîagain, totally talking ass‚Äîmaybe long-term rates acceptance would lower approval younger school-aged children came quickly. last couple years shown mankind perhaps we'd hoped was.  brilliant modern problems, modern solutions. Really hoping thats autocorrect goof! saying?

Clarifying data used /u/WorldThrombosisDay compare risk blood clot Covid vs vaccine doesn‚Äôt need answered? 

Or people outside USA need attend AMA?  sounds like you‚Äôre saying kids collateral damage get laid. Kids aren‚Äôt bars adult places grocery stores. Maskfree bars fine grocery store? Covid brought amazing selfishness people Well, fact need wait 3.5 weeks till fully vaccinated anyway, really half week extra. laughs b1617 strain people would reject million dollars. great way clean friend list lotto advertisement get vaccinated. 

My state spending money ads ran national NBA games cheap ad spots. one form advertisement better another? guess see data comes in. Thats authoritarian post applies to. happened ‚Äútrust science‚Äù?  Yes keep making point every minute wrong every single time try. absolutely people think vaccine work someone else vaccinated, time virus spreads chance mutate, already doing, eventually may mutate way makes vaccines ineffective, suspect already know choosing feign ignorance. still slight chance spread covid fully vaccinated know ""significantly* lower chance unvaccinated. I'm also gonna guess ""paper Sweden"" bullshit like rest comment. least say strawman. Also go ahead get vaccine that's cool. ppl constantly must done go back normal life. There's ppl pissing moaning go mask less shots. Like fuck man, point gotta end  It‚Äôs confusing psy op ask me. We‚Äôve seen countless republicans TAKEN VACCINE SPEW BS SAYING DONT TAKE VACCINE viewers. It‚Äôs really weird. Yeah, totally get it. even follow news closely anymore headlines get hand sometimes. mental health, try jump every headline breaking news story see wait time pass. lot news see never pans something serious fades background.

I've lived Asia many years seeing people masks weird anymore. completely understand people like it. Even want wear time forever. Even people Asia wear 24/7. still flu outbreaks Japan every winter even mask culture. 

I've wearing masks planes years getting tired getting sick time. definitely helped get sick. I'll fine future choice mask sometimes want to. want to, won't. pandemic really messed psychologically well. feels weird think taking mask indoors know I'll eventually get it, need push. think best part gives people reluctant vaccine time get time opening. month away, gives people chance schedule vaccines okay opening day. Yes, today. 

Which CA currently sticking June 15. new question/issue. Children either get required vaccines (or fill paperwork detailing medical exemption, sometimes religious exemption depending locale) can't enroll school/etc [Here‚Äôs good article vaccines developed quicker we‚Äôve able year since 1st volunteers got shots, 150 million people US gotten least one shot. That‚Äôs lot chances side effects show up. hand, long term risks complications Covid much greater, even 30. that‚Äôs know right now. reached two important conclusions. Firstly, COVID-19 markedly increases risk CVT, adding list blood clotting problems infection causes. Secondly, COVID-19 risk higher see current vaccines, even 30; something taken account considering balances risks benefits Experts: *spend months hyping vaccine way end pandemic*

*people understandably excited get back normal*

News Outlets Businesses: *well might matter still carry transmit virus infect others*

Experts: *do refute it*

People: ‚Äúwhy need get vaccinated nothing change?‚Äù

Media: ‚ÄúVaccine Skepticism time high‚Äù  Why? states like New Hampshire Vermont held back states need dragged future kicking screaming?   Yeah even turn GPS... Facebook ad recommendations know interested in, barely even use Facebook monitoring websites, Google search approximate city bottom page either IP address nearest cell tower. There's database per state everyone put it, understanding, everyone sharing info CDC may give similar recommendations, same. extremely ignorant (and american) view. I'm US, CDC worldwide organisation. is. pressure put investigate origins, pandered china trusted word. past, pandemics recognised countries infections. time, waited whole world infected call it. influences countries decision making travel kills people proxy. this? China bully use influence (and bribes) force WHO's hand protecting reputation.  much involved worldwide geopolitics medicine, worldwide organisation unlike CDC.

Are suggesting CDC influence WHO? consider CDC does, even though CDC probably influential national health agencies world stage? 


My point is, can't analyze global vacuum, especially world geopolitics. National health agencies definitely play part advice gives. least, form baseline comparison. Dialogue goes ways. 


You argue pandering China, masks would poor example such. China probably one highest rates mask adherence; WHO's advice needing mask least likely heeded East Asian countries, since mask wearing part culture. Western countries hand, bought advice advice changed. again, sure use example pandering China. 


I'm defending China's actions here, clear, definitely blocked access world conduct proper investigations coronavirus.

Debating viewpoint simple: viewpoint can't defend viewpoint worth having. Anal swabs. Get stoned two birds once, right? /s  I've known people buy tickets can't afford can. I'm saying people responsible generally degenerates also correlate make sound financial decisions. 2nd shot. Yes, you‚Äôre missing lots nurses refusing get vaccinated. guy worst. Rather speculating, get test done. 

My wife somehow came common colds April 2020 despite basically going nowhere wearing N95s. agree definitely respect people's right wear wear mask, harrassment either side. far saying political, ship already sailed. Lots people's response new CDC guidelines masks ""I'm going keep wearing mask want anyone think I'm Republican."" about? person talking bunkering away tiny risk you. Vaccines great, minimize risk disease, they're ticket normal life, small amount vaccinated people still die. wrong, got called it, take L move on. There's shame wrong, absolutely shameful act like shown wrong. visited pediatric cancer hospital covid required everyone wear mask wouldn‚Äôt much stretch One day look back marvel stupidly shipped people vaccines instead way around. Hey, asshat, going anyway issue ban covid protocols...

All (and suspect goal) trying increase tension business/local governments potential voters... hope over, UN World Health Organization empowered deal nations openly defy guidance. far good UN currently is: club five superpowers veto positive change hurts interests.

WHO guidance legally binding member states, something followed member states much consistency dollop bird crap car windshield. would never English, South African, Brazilian Indian variants concern country actually told.

Some world leaders acted dismally recklessly want see brought International Criminal Court actions. little pipe dream I'm pretty sure there's UN resolution statute currently existence could justify bringing political leader Hague this...  Uhhhhh, I'm cherry picking anything. lockdown restrictions effective claim obvious correlations states different things. example, states eased restrictions barely worst numbers vice versa. case all. 

 already numerous findings analyses show plenty mandates regulations end people thought did. 

 example, heres depth analysis mandates restrictions counties country period lockdowns whether like found masks almost make difference compared measures like closing certain areas restricting travel etc.  found could statistically attribute masks 1% difference cases deaths study completely within margin error. published directly CDC website going try argue know tell you.  spend money hoax? sore throat runny nose whole week, sounds like common cold me. worry much symptoms change. That‚Äôs literally unrelated question think auto mod bit zealous. Yep agree unfortunately, Deep South + Fl TX last stronghold Covid US EDIT: oh Utah great vaccinations hopefully protected responsible neighbors need bring kids inside store? plenty options people want go store now. That's great news! Today's numbers pretty bad. expecting (hoping?) 12-15s would start flatten overall curve tiny bit. 

Although issue today, affect numbers tomorrow earliest? CDC data always couple days behind pharmacies submit data state departments health.  gamble. UK thing. 

From mathematical standpoint, vaccine efficacy greater 50 percent first shot, societal effects getting 48 percent population single dose better getting 24 percent population double dosed

UK studies already shown 12 week gap improves antibody response Astra Pfizer vs 3 week gap Anyone vaccinated also cross border essential medical reason quarantine. 

It‚Äôs vaccination proof, it‚Äôs proof essential medical travel.  1.) Love username. 

2.) I'm actually surprised this. follow PA that's came (in NY now), lot family still. anti-vax sentiment runs strong, family, reading comments local news stations. hope matter vocal minority hush hush majority getting vaxed talking want deal crap. especially case presidential-type governments like US head government limited say government does. parliamentary systems, however, fair say head government (the Prime Minister) responsible governmental success/failure. Prime Ministers direct control legislative policy agenda; presidents not. Yea it‚Äôs totally fine. might feel extra tried sore tomorrow though! Im dentist kept telling people past year absolute best time get braces you‚Äôll transformed smile time people see again! Thank continuing this! woohoo 60%! RemindME! November 27, 2036 ""Mind yous thought vaccine gonna kill everybody, ya fuckin wallopers??"" Ask many people vaccine killed vs many people covid killed. Quite possibly worst argument long history terrible arguments lol least developed countries, rules going change quickly next 1-2 months countries see virus less complete control vaccines. greater willingness allow travel even someone comes back COVID matter population effectively immune (although countries may continue worry SA variant, especially relied AZ and/or less effective vaccines like Sinovac). I‚Äôve got couple friends also surprised hear weren‚Äôt getting vaccinated. could care less already covid I‚Äôve vaccine. hope get FDA fully approves it‚Äôs none business. Kind of. I'm expecting NE West coast basically virus free end summer. southeast there's enough uptake. It'll around 5-10 per 100k long time tbh. assumption, whether correct not, people want vaccine fully safe June 15, based everyone get it.

I think moved 6 weeks 12-15 could get it, would unpopular asking someone wear pants shoes shirt go store awesome, mask step far. able exercise 4.5 mile run day first dose. One thing notice strength stayed gas quicker, maybe bike far usually do. personally think CDC waited lifted mask mandate entirely June, goalpost moving see people defending maintaining mask mandate ridiculous.

Pretty much. Problem is, would lifted June, people saying waited July. they'd waited July, people would said end summer. ""End summer"" would met ""wait 2022."" forth.

For people, we'll *never* see metrics good enough change policy, good time rip band-aid. Desantis bad comment worse. 3rd highest population! Woo hooooo!  Failed vaccine? Astra Zaneca vaccine common rest world. Anyways, saying Pfizer Moderna fail variants. saying want see peer reviewed study showing don't

In lab tests shown 6.8 times less effective, effective enough preventing serious disease. variants get dangerous. viruses could evolve vaccine would dengue, HIV etc., vaccines. Indeed. (for part) affixed mask; help everyone else theirs. WHAAAAAAT! 
Indian here, I've lost multiple friends relatives 30s even 20s personally. People lying road front hospitals oxygen cylinders. entire Indian twitter full SOS requests people literally begging. 
 
My city seen explosion Black Fungus cases COVID. stock injections used treat sufficient year worth cases earlier used less week, people rotting within medications them. 
Every news paper's obituary separate page COVID deaths. I'm personally stuck lockdown far worse last year. Even grocery shopping allowed 3 days week 2 hours only. Many poor people verge starving work since last month. 
Its propaganda, sad reality. What's worse ruined mental health almost everyone know. Depression rampant economic hardships, personal hardships people facing. leave social media week depression caused seeing entire feed well-off people begging oxygen, hospital beds medicines. 
 
TLDR - Indian employee either lying accurate picture. push anti-lockdown message result numbers California? state earliest strictest lockdowns? ended slightly worse numbers cases deaths per capita Florida, lax policies.  One woman said someone keyed husband's car, another said driver flipped finger

Oh no, two people, help! end, comes money. already pretty evident stores businesses requiring masks losing customers require it. sounds silly, alas, reality live in. given choice, people go businesses require them.

Now businesses may care continue enforce masks, year shutdowns uncertainty, see businesses changing tune try recover quicker transitioning 'mask recommended' stance.  Honestly may option depending location April. Availability really sprang month went on. expected drive second dose, end month bother making distant appointment. Ask avoid chemicals, H2O? No, I‚Äôm not. It‚Äôs shame axios pushing lies.   LOL! bartended long time, would bust id every time someone talked back, even old enough drink? time I'm older.   fair, UK NHS centralised Healthcare system get, putting aside fact NHS England, NHS Scotland, NHS Wales NHS Northern Ireland. NHS contact details practically everyone country working alongside local GPs. 

Combine information old people are, medical conditions people have, live, etc, NHS plan who, people able get vaccine.

The strength NHS national medical emergency, like coronavirus. NHS slow get going, lack funding, they're moving becomes hard slow down. smart gov would saved $3 million offered everyone gets VAX $150 RESTAUNT VOUCHER. HECK, $300. GREAT LOCAL ECONOMY!! know he‚Äôs that‚Äôs getting rid mask mandates many people can‚Äôt get vaccine pretty callous opinion one many failed vaccines last year, talking current accepted vaccines. trying dense? threat you. unvaccinated people CDC never said unvaccinated could go maskless.

Very antimaskers get vaccine. Since stores enclosed places, unless way weed unvaccinated vaccinated, way allow vaccinated go maskless without endangering process vaccinated. Wearing mask effective person wearing one too.

Waiting want vaccine fully vaccinated means bad actors amongst antimaskers wait majority want vaccine safe mark.

The science say let people run amouk. deaths. masks easy. Kids vaccinated sept. really wait then. people upvoting silly comment? logic, local governments shouldn‚Äôt able tell individuals do!

This rule law. American rule law divides decision making power federal government states. That‚Äôs it. subdivisions US constitution. there‚Äôs mental gymnastics required. Error article: ""Even though United States never vaccine supply issues...""

We serious supply issues April. Back February canceled 100,000 appointments area canceled deliveries. worried 2nd shot appointments parents March. lid really come mid-April. month people assume always way now. not. subsequently wrong risk reality turned much less perceived risk. took AZ vaccine I'm moron poor sense personal risk assessment. think one now. It‚Äôll happening daily new rule Fair President would probably get chosen Congress.

So basically Prime Minister. actually many regulations exist protect children accidentally drowining pools/hot tubs. city live in, pool/hot tub completely fenced in, neighbors kid drowns pool criminally liable. Yeah thing happen family also want life back. got vaccine arguing fairness mask mandates. Whatever helps sleep night  fair, get vaccine pretty easily places Canada now. hobbies yes. like biking cooking. enjoy building models. go Reddit hour day. I'm worried guy maybe go Reddit many many hours per day. questions feel free ask. really upset said simply block me. Thanks I'm literal teenager. One thing remember take account. every TX county enacted local Covid prevention mandates, least one (probably one TBH) TX counties decreed Covid prevention measures considered strictly voluntary within county last spring also refused enforce Abbott's statewide mandates active. pandemic situation TX complex. far two friends told getting vaccinated. quite shocking considered relatively educated. refuse vaccine 'it kills people' 'it's chemical' absurd compared taking chances virus....anyway...my question : able convince otherwise. get fully vaccinated, pose kind threat health? negative effect others, vaccinated? really *shrug* well guess hopefully end ICU? There's also entirely apolitical reality rural areas dangerous urban areas terms spread, personal risk assessment different among rural people. probably wait. side effects come rather suddenly, don‚Äôt want halfway ride suddenly need lie down. Speaking UK... we've got 2,323 cases Indian variant (a 77% increase less week.) could become dominant strain within matter days poses real risk putting country back lockdown. Boris shut borders, absolutely first thing enacting *national lockdown* Texas vaccines available every adult since end March, nearing end May. rules go effect new school semester starts August/September.

Every adult capable willing get shot gotten shot then. Anyone immunocompromised unable get vaccine take precautions always take precautions pandemic.

Those willingly choosing get vaccine deal personal responsibilities making choice. It‚Äôs one vaccinated states far. Right it‚Äôs dead easy get vaccine (I‚Äôm LA area).

Man, right. drop ridiculous mask mandate today, like rest country. twelve fifteen year old determined thing certainly put unrelenting pressure parents get done give peace.

I know determined, mostly family member severe covid dead it.

There‚Äôs also nine states minors get vaccinated without parental consent. state one :) often hard find doc it.

I‚Äôm glad coworkers vaccinating kids ASAP. flurry last minute time requests accommodate since took available time slot could get past days. encountered nurse Reddit thought SARS-CoV-2 mutated rapidly *HIV.* large chunk India, extreme poverty, education religious dogma. It‚Äôs also really helpful reaching groups inconsistent access medical care, like homeless people. remember first real office job college would drive 15 miles way suburbs downtown, drive would take 45mins-1hour way. would sitting car FUMING anger idiot drivers I'd sharing road with. Every new route tried problem. would sit think ""this unhealthy, possibly every single day rest miserable life"". would never guessed pandemic would relieved awful burden. pretty sure banning country high COVID rates racist... least that's claimed Trump Send 'em Mexico*** good example. one gonna keep wearing masks go stores like? Naturally... Saw comment California lifting mask mandates June said...

""It's refreshing live somewhere sane see 90% people still masking 10% white guys 60s. White privilege finest!""

The blatant elitism, delusion, hypocrisy painful read... It‚Äôs still pretty high. I'll keep curbside pickup Target like throughout pandemic. going store keeps making impulse purchases, win around. mean nothing. people free want. think low chance child dying COVID, something need worry about. wouldn‚Äôt doubt honestly. We‚Äôre horribly reopening. hoping recall would light fire Newsom‚Äôs ass EXACTLY! take risk? better cautious take precaution instead subject either them, even non-predisposed child, could potentially make ill! feel like want keep 11 year-old home masked even though already resistance.

This exactly am. 3 year old 8 month old. 8 month old met 4 adults entire life. 3 year old seen another kid age (except distance park) since birthday Feb 2020. Neither ever kind sick, still resistance? hate this.  Everyone ought watch once. many ways, pandemic best-case scenario. Relatively low death rate, responsive treatment, vaccines quickly developed. Health care system never overwhelmed (in US). riots looting reasons.

This dress rehearsal ought get use get ready big game know coming one days. propose restrict private lives unvaccinated? Saying mission accomplished get wear mask beneath nose supermarket mean they're following anything else. 

It's like anti-maskers anti-vaxxers followed social distancing throughout pandemic.  Yeah, too. sheer stupidity people following science enrages infuriates me. really drives home ""doesn't matter happens me"" aspect many people country. available children 11 under. Yeah, get sick year, instinct around friends family. I'd surprised I've ever gotten cold random passerby grocery store. Based conducted conversation dont kids probably young adult early 20s. opinion would kids means nothing. Biotech manufacturing here. changes yet we're California nothing changing mid June. idea plan then. They've started voluntary program report vaccination status scan vaccine card. Naw it‚Äôs tiny number. dropping quickly. Glad people like sub show us light. People don‚Äôt sit crowded spaces hours time restaurants, libraries, movie theaters? They‚Äôve also said vaccinated still wear masks correctional facilities homeless shelters. people different germs places hotels schools? 

People questioning doesn‚Äôt make sense, they‚Äôre crazy.   Im vaccinated. Still wear mask. Im 2 weeks post op. Ill still keep wearing mask. Til feel safe enough .. went one enforcing it. Saw lot masks. northern Wisconsinite, I'd say 99% people wore masks Walmart. That's bad British though, apparently. America actual export ban, EU barely says word. might hung use ""goal"". meant warning us start finish covid likely become endemic rather eradicated. two diseases ever declared eradicated. Every met endemic finish line, even effective vaccines.

I guess might true entire global population followed guidelines tee timeline, could eradicated naturally without vaccine, far fetched expectation public health officials hopeful about. Disappointed surprised  I'm Cvicu RN taken care people front lines since started. yeah. Thanks compassion others. Exactly thought. leave mad bro. try little harder next time. awesome vaccinated workers. one place children dont go (workshops, offices, warehouses etc) see zero need keep masks work. /s

You dropped this. great news. also generous. Vaccinating Canadian truck drivers drive North Dakota regularly protect people living North Dakota Covid19 vaccinating farmers live North Dakota. Ditto everything said, I'm Midwest, too. everyone flyover states dumbass, thankfully. Man, CDC really fucked removing mask mandate. saddening people can't get vaccine, immunocompromised, children, etc. beyond fucked. Antivaxxers eat shit though. Absolute morons.  best bud 

Low risk risk. Yah plan still wearing them. sure super comfortable yet. Plus still young kids home can't vaccinated yet.  ok bro still keep repeating will, must reason surely?

Cause they've seen level PR war EU declare miss targets, they'll hide delay happening long possible.   looking something amazon says is. Thanks. We've using vogmasks. Screen damaged must newer talking point dipshits. pathetic canned insults losers can't actually form own. 

You know people lie internet time right? look mirror. Sorry little ploy pan way expected maybe try little harder useless anecdotes next time? üòò think stat saw someone share 1/200 chance dying, car crash. 1/200 car crashes deadly.  you‚Äôre vaccinated it‚Äôs saving lives. Half customers local grocery store weren‚Äôt wearing masks things got lifted. know cases dropping US think it‚Äôs definitely best keep masks little longer. Especially new strain India spreading...it looks pretty bad tbh There‚Äôs lot worse problems long covid losing sense taste. It'll interesting see Meijer follows suit keeps masks place. Either way, I'll least carry one me. r/nextfuckinglevel large portion population also antibodies it? also COVID vaccine  appreciate taking time discuss it. It‚Äôs ‚Äúfear-mongering‚Äù it‚Äôs simple concern. guess come Doctor put it, vaccines fire suit. protects getting burned. don‚Äôt intentionally walk building fire. feel situation caused knee jerk CDC guidance puts building fires indoor places business. That‚Äôs all. It‚Äôs concern, sincerely hope correct. wearing mask vaccinated impact anyone. Muh two weeks! Lol nut else ensure virus keep mutating eventually become resistant vaccine? people COVID? Can't whatever was?  uv lamp, thanks confidence us üëç Well spike protein virus able enter cells, protein makes spike specific shape matches human cells enter them. would mutate protein antibodies cannot bind yet still able bind enter humans cells. 

It‚Äôs likely, might need boosters keep efficacy years though Sorry. misread room. I‚Äôm glad that‚Äôs meant lol. 

I‚Äôm excited see progress. Ah, thought he'd faking sick. Looks like he's faking healthy. Kind weird thing considering context. Wishful thinking. I'd rather avoid disappointing myself. Using test negative case control design, results ‚â•70s age group Pfizer/BioNTech AstraZeneca vaccines shown Figure 1. Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, odds ratio starts decline 10 13 days vaccination, reaching 0.42 (95%CI 0.35-0.51) 28 days vaccination, equivalent vaccine effectiveness 58%. AstraZeneca vaccine decline begins 14 20 days vaccination reaches odds ratio 0.44 (95%CI 0.35 0.57) 28 35 0.42 (95%CI 0.28 0.62) 35 days vaccination equivalent vaccine effectiveness 58%.

The age group study 70 years older. all.  It‚Äôs nice see progress.  Yes am. said words ‚Äúa months‚Äù way minimize data. still lot unanswered questions. really aren‚Äôt though. Yeah he's exaggerating lol, would shocked he's still October  Well... shit! 1 200 people die car crash? We‚Äôre level now. least live.Ôøº Meijer actually told employees enforce mask rules, arguing anti-maskers accomplished nothing wasting everyone‚Äôs time energy. It‚Äôs even fool‚Äôs errand science governor side. Yeah, introvert ass finally getting isolation I've desperately craved entire life. Heaven, gonna lie. Can't believe it. Even *DC* faster us. Yeah, ngl Canadian certainly hope governments little cautious US been. Hope rest big cities follow path. Stop fear mongering please. Especially transmission chances mutation makes vaccine, masking social distancing efforts moot.  agree you‚Äôre comment maybe lost level headed common sense comment I‚Äôve seen. mostly it‚Äôs circle jerk. 

The amount posts talking place place stopping requirements concerning covid abundant say least. one who‚Äôs shot care. Get shots, take mask go back normal life. God kept safe, millions people? Without God would vaccine. God would want safe Yes! husband set Thursday pharmacy. That's place town J&amp;J Thursdays. forgot say, target lifting face masks FULLY VACCINATED people. Non vaccinated people must continue wear masks. 100% certain need them? basically already knew cases months ago US sat anyway, pointlessly costing lives many vaccines could've saved. 
 
*WOW!* charity. bow benevolence, cost thousands lives. Well, sent us scientists able make vaccine, he!? threated force right thing rather help everyone around you, says lot you. Comin' save motherfuckin' day, yeah! Good Never Canada, right? friend love disagree strongly, house uninvited started crying ‚ÄúBiden forcing us get vaccinations.. won‚Äôt it, causes sterilization?‚Äù it‚Äôs just... agh. sheer lack knowledge vaccines people ignoring real guaranteed danger possible likely impossible fears.. makes want scream. Believe me, still young. got Astra Zeneca vaccine last Tuesday breathlessness chest pain five days got first shot Covishield New Delhi, India. deal this? Wrong. desire equitable chance people healthy. 

If anything, covid denyers, anti-vaxxers, GQP arguing bad faith goal post moving. always same. really justify education level decisions make someone random internet. No, us friends I, individually given ultimatum. vaccines we‚Äôve slowed rate infection enough people don‚Äôt wear masks. children hahahhaaaa Hello fellow sufferer. contamination OCD. hell. Also difficult relationships. need metric fuck ton therapy behave normally ever again.  China case. first week January, United States already ahead them. 

Despite large population, India never point administered doses country actively vaccinating. 

You look numbers either absolute form, relative population World Data. Awesome, dumb fucking antivax + antimask family go catch shit public. Wonderful. Fuck anti-vaxxers. They're holding society moving forward. disagree require law. Well least public schools universities, employment eventually require well. idiots want live society, forced accept rules society. can't wait till FDA full approval idiots legally mandated get vaccine want benefits society. colleges going wait full FDA approval mandating vaccines. develop response, yes. part small % vaccine zero measures mentioned work Target Audience mainly Karens Target hypothetical--the CoronavirusUK mods specifically mentioned app one ones people use.

Honestly, something needs done this. r/CoronavirusUK took measures slow brigading. can't r/Coronavirus? truly genius No, neither prevents contraction transmission. information WIDELY available please don‚Äôt ask source it. Makes total sense, thank you. contamination OCD could written husband. Literally checked profile thought found Reddit account! (I not, stranger.) Meanwhile India dont enough vaccines get everyone vaccinated. Many able get first shot missed timeline second one available. talking people 60+. hope younger ones near future.

Sad world live in. acceptable America? Yes. standard? Taiwan can‚Äôt afford constant testing? 

My dear, cost test (on good day, 100-200USD per person PCR, half antigen lower reliability) per person. trained medical personnel whose time could better spent caring high-risks, hours lost regular employment production, on. Test sites could super-spreader events careful. mean even India problem cost testing

A lot good did.... :( think Australia that's way far end 2022 wish could go back 18 live life 18-35 continuous never ending repeat loop. lot fun liver good. lived weekends. Work something drinking money. Eventually, get older, maybe get better job, promoted position responsibility boomers finally retire. get family, mortgage piles bills. Things change time. life good now, think back......... miss it. That's excellent point!  contract transmit vaccine. Either job reducing symptoms contract virus won't. vaccine status dependent efficacy yours. way. 

We Canadian, neighbour family member married American. strongly conservative one. family member ""got to"" 2 members Candian family here, convinced get vaccinated. neighbour's partner said, ""That's fine. get see kids, then."" want get shot week California. want wait I'd lottery also Good move gym! may go back mine that. past year weight bench weights home. hide limited time way India did. comment absolutely disgusting. thing meeting middle threatening ""force"". construction, frequently sling around cases beer wine several hours day. Wearing mask *really* suck hotter months year.

That said, dealt took breaks whenever needed. shit get done, fuck it. mom want it. applied pressure. Relentlessly. Without mercy. got it. Great answer. People seem representing tribes tossing data out. risks involved every decision. One part scientific discussion absent preexisting health problems, covid likely posses little risk her, vaccine. Ironic even conservative pro Trump relative FIRST get shot family talk vaccine.


Not hypocritical, least. contamination OCD set back years progress. really unhealthy give intrusive thoughts life action. Everything fought long good behavior protecting oneself developing pandemic (I refer developing advice best practices morphing changing quickly beginning). 

That said, I‚Äôm thankful loved ones alive. recover okay. Plus, OCD never truly gone. finds new ways working way life trying develop new compulsions. point use skills learn therapy squash gets foothold. So, use tools. Seek therapy. Survive setbacks. would happened need control captive narrative audience splitting, picking individuals group drive off, rejoining overpower remaining dissenting opinion reducing visibility long strings slightly upvoted chitchat. uncommon rodeo reddit. extremely defensive weird.

Animosity became directed shit measures even precautions.

2020.02.06: friend's mother Chinese, transfer flight originated Bangkok goes Taiwan, even set foot Taiwan soil, blocked transferring flight stuck airport rebook flights. make fucking sense help situation anyway. directed Chinese, one happened China previous two weeks. nationalities went merry way.

Let remind US officials already brought virus Canada Japan allowed enter Taiwan without quarantine August. That's kind measures everyone everywhere now. What's problem?

No problem lol. pointing well made plan suggesting Taiwan made sweeping effective changes, they've used know trying say prove.

If believe infectious disease get caught multiple times countries, manifests plane leaves Taiwan Taiwan boast 1xx days new infections, obviously know sorts public health expert... show that's narrative? point always containment without jeopardizing health system economy. contact tracing given high priority.

What know I'm actually really health expert. said 2020 April social distancing flatten curve shams. Wearing masks stamping virus like China, Australia NZ correct way look are. Oh wait contact tracing mentioned always gave back 0 results. much contact faulty reasoning results faulty conclusions. trying justify China's block health contributors name politics simply middle-school grade.

Really sure Taiwan problems water, electricity, testing, vaccines claim model world, supportive maybe country copy Taiwan's method. rest world invite Taiwan China lol, anti-China group countries everyone knows what's up. Concerning flu seasonal flu actually travels Southern hemisphere that's yearly mutation happens winter, brought back us winter. (Learned pandemic, someone else explained me) Damn dude that's pretty fucking nasty sentiment spitting ngl meet middle voluntarily right thing forced.

Yikes.. ""Do told force you"".. I'm 40 felt me. Remember like 3 minutes ago science masks protect others offer lot protection wearer? That's ""mask up"" really protect well unmasked unvaccinated walking around policy changes.  Stop talking ass look data literally proves vaccine stops transmission. reason young people needing vaccinated (despite low risk) variants could mutate appear don't. variants infectious, something could change completely deadly also completely immune vaccines, months getting risk people vaccinated would vain whole new vaccine would needed developed + tested + distributed would take another year cause whole bunch unnecessary deaths. can't believe literally millions deaths worldwide people still debating covid live pretty conservative county Maryland (the klan still active county puts conservativeness perspective), went Walmart lifted mandate surprised many people still wearing masks. saw couple employees without them, handful customers weird walking stores seeing cashiers without masks. even read comment? Look circumstances. He's fine.  UK highest trust rates world? know theres plenty know. know there's plenty know. something learn. know anything immediate conditions sure hell know anything health really place tell get jab. couple states really bad Hep B outbreaks pandemic. Kentucky one. I'm always surprised many adults Hep B vaccine, even eat restaurants lot.  RemindMe! 40 Days sure real moderators would get this, political post. It‚Äôs correlation versus causality political people‚Äôs argument doesn‚Äôt hold up. Remove must, trying help people see pandemic non political lens. fair new vaccine unlike others compare still trials. Additionally lets real, young risks covid high, data shows available data shows trial new vector vaccine safe. talk Dr make decision talking vaccinated people. 

Vaccinated people outdoors don‚Äôt need masks. ceasing requirements people indoors, matter they‚Äôre vaccinated not, plain bad idea. decision increase profits also cause real people die. Threaten call cps Bring stand in?  really gonna sit around ten years waiting great ""OK, virus gone, go back normal""?

Of course not. quite likely may covid booster shots similar flu vaccine every year due mutations future, ideally many people vaccinated worldwide possibly limit number mutations manageable number.

dont really like shots, hopefully doesnt hurt much

I also hope dont reactions like brother since karate day (which person)  I‚Äôm extremely rare cases Frankly anyone make concrete claims effects fertility regarding vaccine still trials irresponsible. 
They make observation based small window time evaluate, concrete claims.... Honestly, wish Federal Government would thing.   People couldn‚Äôt even stay fuck inside homes two weeks. There‚Äôs way wear masks longer.  fairly certain made decision another significant increase supply June. area eventually everyone prio group 3 really tried vaccine got one..I guess point people cry loudest get appointment. maybe try calling several GPs area. could also try register websites like sofort-impfen.de. fan lifting priorities early either think could waited bit longer. However, see declining infection rates every shot helps overall Covid situation, reduces risk all. *Number one, fuck yeah!!*  one. im 15 im getting vaccine thursday pog feel like crush ads effective know better. They'll use horseshit argument know can't possibly believe avoid saying real truth. Maybe tiny percent really dumb enough scared cure disease that's people. wish they'd say truth. wish they'd say, ""because want want matters anyone anything."" I'd respect came said it. Yeah it‚Äôs dumb. I‚Äôve read going open (Hawaii) vaccinated US people summer test. Something issues verifying vaccine records. vaccinated people told still need wear masks? Edited, tried clarify. You‚Äôre lucky governor slow. helping people aren‚Äôt fully vaccinated yet. Complete normalcy come. would great month ago, vaccines pretty much open 12+ 18+ across Canada, bad option. Next step would ideally opening borders sides fully vaccinated. surely did. March 2020 cockeyed conspiracy nut thought vaccine passports would happen. I'm young person age bracket 100% assure one around age know demanding this. hard enough breathe 30+ weeks pregnant. can't imagine covid top that, country denied medical treatment. poor women. though? don‚Äôt get it. Dude, CDC people USA know. They're American organisation.

Just trusted give good advice (and replicated advice) mean protecting China. protected China, CDC know they're protecting China, CDC copied advice favours China. 

But I'm talking all. Forget CDC. i'm talking mostly geopolitical advice, personal recommendations CDC gives. CDC advise countries investigate.

Literally shit like investigating origin calling pandemic. CDCs job CDC would never access China. worldwide meant access country investigate.

It's clear reading comments know anything this. forget please. definitely surge March/April. Relative surges, big, though jump 30% low Mar 23rd, high Apr 14th.  ‚ÄúAllows‚Äù. Give fucking break. never ‚Äú allowed‚Äù anyone entering store without mask even employees often wore masks two nostrils flaring kid one them! Let‚Äôs check back comment months we're almost 85% 65 initiating. Americans like vaccines, despite usually see posted subreddit around social media media general.  that's one approved people 18  I'll take mask every state zero COVID deaths zero new cases!

I'm saying able make valid geopolitical argument time. cant always get want. ‚ô´ Exactly 7-day average 44 per day. zero cases day reporting anomaly lazy journalists ran better time job search.

The government recommended 1% pay rise NHS staff McGee also told programme, Year Britain Stopped, ""a lot nurses"" felt government ""hadn't led effectively"" ""indecisiveness"" ""so many mixed messages"".

 said ""very upsetting"".

The nurses strike. 1% pay rise went still doing? Meanwhile trillionaires billionaires raking cash.

It‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt take crystal ball see large nursing shortage happening UK. Even nurses come UK Immigration benefit see it‚Äôs worth it. literally said first sentence influence other.

I think arguing sake arguing, know full picture situation.

The made many terrible decisions benefitted China. CDC make decisions, control WHO. specific cases, made recommendations parallel based outdated studies (such social distancing), I'm talking about.

I'm talking geopolitics. fact WHOs job let people know new diseases, investigate said diseases, call pandemic order give advice.

The CDC involved this. relay information say let people USA know.

I know focus CDC, job put pressure countries new diseases emerge. WHOs job try get information countries, prevent spread, give world advice. 

I care CDC, talking WHO. Forget CDC. years COVID deniers deny ever existed  that's fine. Everyone decide risk level guilt others moving different pace. Thats get shot ass. beat sucker Yeah ramped bit though lagging behind NY CA (the Big 4 population states) hopefully hit goals end summer (Fl probably sooner due high percentage senior citizens) Deaths still around 700 three weeks april case peak, cases fallen half. looking mid 300s mid June. get vaccine said anything like stop spreading lies get vaccine never herd immunity negativity. vaccinated RA reason either get vaccinated! raging hardline fanatic. Covid problem kids, science point much debate, unless new data. feel need white knight need concerned old people, obese people males - risk groups. Leave kids alone. Keep mask mandate place unvaccinated people get rid vaccinated people. exactly CDC said sorry patients. much cancer treatment operations stopped height pandemic even longer. patients don‚Äôt immune response. range peak bad flu season, flu deaths averaged year. collapse case numbers (down 50% since mid April) forecasts continued decline death numbers.

Looking case numbers now, means deaths weeks (when people catch might die), we're typical flu season level risk. propose ensure unvaccinated wear masks? care cdc advice shouldn‚Äôt let break it. fair Indian variant seem level escape according many reports. much SA variant, mean vaccinated people UK getting mild moderate illness vaccine even 3 months ago. im proud one them! fly dozen times year can't remember last time kid baby bothered me. Wear headphones. basically Prime Minister.

Sort of. already planning President fixed four- six-year term, instead Prime Ministers get turned office whenever Parliament votes confidence. then, vote confidence really thing yet 1788 - first vote confidence happened Great Britain right Battle Yorktown 1782, till mid-1800's became established practice. So, President really would've like 1700's-era British Prime Minister. Texas Florida done reasonable job getting people vaccinated least. Covaxin. yo.

Well, according NY times currently 33950 hospitalized Covid patients. total 919559 staffed hospital beds US, even counting nursing home beds. means Covid patients currently taking 3.6% total hospital beds whole country. even close overwhelming healthcare system, number dropping. something do. Let us pray. matter many times ignore this, change fact CDC said vaccinated people need wear masks. flat said it. President Biden flat said it.

The advice CDC game vaccinated people need wear masks unvaccinated people need continue wearing masks. exact policies implemented follow CDC's guidelines.

You tried argue crap yesterday too. CDC said 2 things, want hear 1 mean CDC say it. lying omission acting like CDC said ""unvaccinated people need continue wearing masks"". think wrong downvote RA got vaccine get vaccine would rather safe sorry reason get vaccine none doctor wrong. seems ""Honor system"" self policing people cheat get covid lead closer herd immunity. get virus place go thus immunocompromised people less risk society. get shot normalcy, nothing normal last year. got protection, taking many precautions possible still much unknown.

Hopefully soon‚Ä¶ terribly ironic Abbott using excuse Texas ""controlled"" higher levels government justify controlling lower levels government. Vast majority people Austin area wear masks. funny thing percentages impact percentage depends dealing with.  Something costs 1% bank account? Probably big deal.

Im even facetious. argument always let people wear mask not, stay home not, protect vulnerable. Sounds radical different this. people 18 US able fully vaccinated. opened people 16+ recently, people 12+ even recently that. takes two six weeks fully vaccinated. months 'America stomping faces' headlines - Canada problem criticising comparing us U.S. People getting vaccinated... year long we‚Äôve criticizing people refusing follow CDC guidelines...and we‚Äôre exact shit ourselves? It‚Äôs fucking insanity hypocritical. Good point. know coworker associating with. Maybe kept masks. anti.mask liars get kids sick. MAY, WILL. that's fucking stupid argument. Children vaccinated yet. risks drastically lower‚Ä¶

Riiighhhhtttt, you‚Äôre Mensa candidate aren‚Äôt ya?

Children already far lower risk negative outcomes due immune systems younger better equipped fight immunio-attack vector.

That‚Äôs public health officials screamed open schools close bars height pandemic?

You‚Äôre blithering idiot think ‚Äúwhat children‚Äù cogent argument America 48% voters give fuck ‚Äúkids‚Äù exit womb.

Do make argument Marijuana legalization? believe stoners give away $20 edibles Halloween kids too?

How drug decriminalization writ large?

Kids survived cell phones, helicopter parents, preferred pronouns, Covid-19, they‚Äôll survive political footballing lives likely far better equipped people actually real world many previous generations been.  multitude Variants concern. 8 maybe 10 times worse original virus. also Sri Lanka VOC virus reported even infectious deadlier indian variants. also widely spread india. isnt race religion economy now. play emergency money spent. One mis-step catastrophic. start Pandemic. case Pandemic Musical Chairs India happened one left standing music stopped.. unfortunate. unfair. necessary. events unfold going deeper level hell humanity ever experienced. new variants spreading across globe much contagious. Get vaccinated ASAP. America supply, there's excuse get vaccinated. Facebook virus. That‚Äôs ignoring statistic 3% covid hospitalizations children though. Yeah kids definitely safer adults it‚Äôs still dumb kids unvaccinated running around maskless everywhere. even Covid worried since vaxxed lol. awareness problem. Like walk public restroom step stranger's piss. head home step floors shoes, take put away whatever, step spot bare feet. Finally, get bed voila, stranger's piss bed lol. That's I'm wondering well. 

I'm sympathetic, can't pretend ""COVID changed everything"" *didn't*. always nasty viruses there. trip early 2020, sitting next mother holding baby. baby chewing toy something threw lap twice, pick up. mask might necessarily saved one, also pretty packed flight, middle 3-seater. sickness followed flight could come several interactions flight. missed post New Years family get-together. pretty much everyone going maskless now, even though vax rate like 30%. think going convince anyone get vaxxed here, point think anything would. information outdated. seen anything reopening sooner? didn‚Äôt even want take citizens back forced change. Sometimes miss time villageidiots stayed isolated, laughed ignored village. Facebook allowed villageidiots world band together spread misinformation.  matter employee safety fights would break tried make unmasked anti-vaxxer/masker mask ask proof vaccination ""Oh well"" turns ""oh hell"" pretty quick one outbreaks propagates new strain makes vaccines less effective. CDC failing us again. spineless corporate toadies Kroger follow suit, like always do. think it‚Äôs pretty normal little nervous year pure freak-out. It‚Äôll get okay, though. patient yourself. Considering measles fuck child, kind claim seems weird I‚Äôm NJ feel pain point, wanna wear mask get vaccinated... That's them. Let risk lives reason.  

Get vaccinated let nature run course... people vaccines one became political?!

Three months ago, medical check got last Pneumonia Vaccine, current check got last Hep. B Vaccine, couple weeks get Tetanus Booster. past several years, kept vaccines every year get Flu shot. Unless deathly scared needles, know people stay shots. Honor system.

The way see it, people lie stuff like already complying.

Old mask, unwashed masks, inappropriate material, chin strap, etc...  Cheaters gonna cheat. would guess vaccine already wearing mask way would accomplish anything.

Most people law abiding, though. Well said

Also almost half population vaccinated (with least 1 dose) may reach herd immunity yet burden healthcare system much alleviated big reason shutdown link data? study? statement CDC? Seems good true, I‚Äôd feel lot better was! isn‚Äôt skiing, it‚Äôs families separated. zero risk isn‚Äôt option. Either Australia gets vulnerable vaccinated accepts risk, never open up. There‚Äôs really options. got injection couple decades. Last December get flu tdap vaccines surprised barely even felt needle. *checks front page upvote ratio*

Most sub fine this. generalize using confirmation bias. roughly ballpark Astrazeneca terms efficacy.

There's real world data Chile Indonesia - infection, 67% 65% respectively; hospitalization/severe cases, 85% 96%. SinoVac vaccine seems less effective Brazilian variant (color *very* skeptical '50.4%' efficacy number Brazilian healthcare workers), becomes dominant strain worldwide, imagine there'd likely booster.

It's jaw droppingly effective badass mRNA vaccines West, definitely handy tool toolbox global fight COVID. Eh, 60% adult population least one shot, estimate 12-15% without vaccine covid, 72-75% immunity risk populations. really risk populations (65+) running estimate 85-90% level immunity.

That's basically herd immunity populations concern. Brazil Italian village titer levels showed 67% penetration community taking precautions. fully vaccinated week now, saw therapist first time person, face face without masks. neglected ask little bit late, therapist unvaccinated. want confirm, there's really nothing worried about, correct? It‚Äôs angry full hatred. Surely non-vaccinated people respect rules voluntarily refrain entering premises continue wearing masks respect health safety others. Honor system. Might well even mention it. former. latter occurred weeks ago.

EDIT: Sources:

It‚Äôs big sacrifice, know, science! ü§î Source might prior exposure Covid, then. Even minor asymptomatic case give enough immunity recognize first dose vaccine. people actually interpreting CDC saying correctly. CDC flat said VACCINATED people need masks. policies put place states / businesses system place actively made sure every single person vaccinated wore mask, would following science. Putting policy place basically allows everyone take mask following science. Delusional. 

Release patents what, nobody knows produce effectively efficiently.

Most countries could afford doses, countries purchased enough themselves. US block exports would able import doses inoculate people timely manner.

But no, correct. part EU allowed 100 countries vaccination plan allowing exports 200m doses horrific. way 200m elderly health care professionals able receive vaccine world early January.

So 200m vaccines dire need EU allowed out, vaccinating vulnerable world January =Bad

The US blocking exports vaccines vaccine day foreseeable future.

Apparently not! problem CDC said ""VACCINATED people need masks"" places basically saying ""No masks!"" CDC said. CDC said ""no masks long system place prove vaccinated"" messaging would clearer easier understand. back napkin math: 

We've given 48% Americans first shot.

The CDC estimates 34% Americans covid. remaining 52% Americans unvaccinated, guess 17% immunity prior covid infection, assuming equal distribution infections.

That brings us 65% Americans amount immunity covid, riiiiiiiiiggggghhht herd immunity threshold list countries yet? ""I'm vaccinated"" Oh I'm sure comply, reasonable people are.

Nothing health 100, want keep living life, eventually rolling dice sorts diseases. vaccines give us great protection, including serious illness, point need stop treading SARS-CoV-2 like boogeyman treat like anything else might make us ill. 

Even years influenza widespread poor vaccines, people probably change day day all. SARS-CoV-2 less dangerous influenza, need accept safe act way, least within smaller groups completely vaccinated people. Science communication seriously undervalued. makes sense, guess, communications science tends undervalued well. There's update bottom Meijer lifted compulsory masking vaccinated shoppers today News said California &amp; New Jersey still mask mandates. Nobody ever given odd passing glance.

Still bullshit can‚Äôt done June 21 Oh way. context nuance needed removed. CDC March 2020 said N95 masks effective covid-19 reason wear mask unless medical professional. Fauci wrote paper describing reason many people died Spanish flu outbreak dying bacterial pneumonia caused wearing masks. figured thing yesterday went every person saw masked masked correctly, even employees. Can't upvote enough. killing discount science saying, ""wear mask, trust science"". can't ways.  ok son Wish Facebook would remove itself. Uhh remember DeSantis put whistleblower jail trying report accurate Covid numbers? 

And forgetting fucking horrendously Trump handled pandemic? necessary. Putting mask person already Vaccinated accomplishing anything.

Imposing arbitrary restrictions grounded science good erodes public trust. mean, kids don‚Äôt really choice many things. kids could choose, many would choose go school all. Uninsured negotiate $1500 ish pretty easily. it‚Äôs still way expensive reason whatsoever. low considering efficacy vaccine, around 40-50%.  
If actually wanted get ""50% population immunized"", would need vaccinate 100%. 

This hard is. matter. one delivering interpreting data. CDC is. virus circulation low, variants less likely arise. idiots volunteered yesterday, lemme tell ya, Sunday wild lot people brought kids walk-in appointments. kinda quiet week though since slowing down, we'll offering last first dose appointments 5/27. Crazy see finally wind down. Yes, actually know really happen. like knew enforced masks would really happen didn't. Either trust science don't. start questioning science makes different someone else questioning science side? say ""I'm protecting others!"" side believe minute. napkin math tells around 20% US population may recovered COVID vaccinated- maybe lot more. add 47% least one dose might 70% total pop immunity already. Last call catch-all. drunk driving, noise complaints (which absolutely stem responsible people well irresponsible people), disorderly conduct, crimes innocent people happen drunk. It‚Äôd also probably happen point onus business anyways. Unless you‚Äôre touristy area, people eventually go home, business peters around 2-3 anyways.

As additional point, states matter revenue. state, it‚Äôs hard time unless business buys liquor license extends it. it‚Äôs religiously influenced well - locales different last call laws regarding saturday nights sundays implemented increase church attendance.  What‚Äôs clear seem unable rate covid alongside everyday risks. issues statistics think emotionally lol they‚Äôre 11. think they‚Äôve signed social media know lie age.

I‚Äôm 15 asked DL wait :(

Got first dose Thursday. People acting like suddenly illegal wear masks. keep wearing forever want. CDC make laws. Nice. Gonna avoid even nice think they‚Äôll give trouble got first moderna dose May 1st sign second one May 28th? (I think that‚Äôs technically 27 days - never gave second date first dose date bc Memorial Day weekend) everybody get vaccinated yet, ever, chance get fully vaccinated. (extremely mild) inconvenience mask indoors another 3-5 months horrible? Serious question...

Does mean better catch now? God gives people sense understanding compassion toward others. translate desire behave ways protects oneself others. see God's protection. Many millions mentioned operated outside truth outside care compassion toward others. Yes, many ""right"" thing still got infected, simply wanted shout YOLO (or whatever equivalent) expose loved ones denying reality pandemic need infection control measures. CDC gave bunch anti-vaxxers ability easily go without masks

Anti-vaxxers without masks whole time anyway. Last summer entire state flooded tourists drove country completely filling bars, restaurants beaches.

Masks never even enforced state. started sheriff's said publicly news would refuse enforce mask guidelines. NYC give shit either. people because, walked mask nobody would ever say shit you. ""place get snow"" thing, think. usually wear fall winter months. They're warm come tons colors match shoes different colored pants. They're great tbh BJP Cell worker spotted think we'll fine till winter we'll might change time tell Unless ask don‚Äôt know reasoning want keep mask on. Could paranoid? Sure. Could trying avoid allergy season bc discovered useful masks keeping asthma related allergy trigger? Sure. Shit maybe wanna hide nasty pimple idk unless ask don‚Äôt know either. someone chooses wear mask don‚Äôt assume political motivation assume reason leave that.  Nope, don‚Äôt get wear mask. Everyone wore mask safety, take safety. people acting immaturely identity hidden, people protected law enforcement it, they‚Äôre much. Sorry get little tummy bug ever years. Yup. antivaxxers celebrating wear masks anymore, duh, could foreseen MIT  clearly confused. talking people judging others wearing masks. welcome wear mask, that's great. need substantiate claim actual science else knowingly peddling false information. good now, bud? think trashy people local area. massive economic political(believe not, CCP‚Äôs power isn‚Äôt absolute) costs that.

They brownie points back premise something like never need happen massive head start produce PPE supplies world. 

CCP can‚Äôt afford again. 

Vaccines needed would even know someone vaccinated?! walk target lie say I'm vaccinated wanted to?

(not vaccinated yet bc anti-vax parents 18 yet, soon tho) 2nd shot wiped 24 hours kind low energy additional 12 hours that. 

If side effects second dose, grateful haha got sick often traveling back fourth working mass transit prior pandemic. crowded areas especially indoors might still wear them. Outdoors won‚Äôt unless it‚Äôs crowded area. I‚Äôm vaccinated still think it‚Äôs best wear mask reduce catching viruses covid. seen many antivax comments here. ""I'm vaxxed bulletproof, pandemic me"" life risks.  Cases drop low levels making even unvaccinated, unlikely get disease.  We're still levels locking down, justifiably, last year. vaccinated problem you. Thank fucking christ. There‚Äôs disturbing amount people getting shot, work field absolutely must shot(teachers, nurses, etc)  warping sense reality. tell need mental health day

Some people find difficult admit superiors (mental health issues still stigmatized, all) would rather lie physically ill. respect confront rather insignificant issue. accomplish anyway? make feel like spied superior, that's good working relation him. Isn‚Äôt said tho? Social pressure people giving masks type shaming?? don‚Äôt care attach politics people choose choose wear masks point. assume someone mask reason unique leave simple. people never go back. kind post-covid hypochondria diagnosis. Pandemic means world wide. wealthy countries may get virus manageable level much world struggle years. mention variants hitting kids harder previously Brazil India.

But 20 somethings Reddit continue gaslight concerned parents KiDs lOw RiSk inconvenienced something even lower risk, wear mask public indoor spaces. weird- experience living suburbs NYC made experience different rest of
the country. thought going store unmasked bizarre- think people little top masking outside hike (when it‚Äôs easy stay 6 feet apart) took long time realize states people don‚Äôt wear masks grocery store. don‚Äôt know. government came said don‚Äôt get vaccine I‚Äôm convinced people would go get it. Moderna arm soreness lasted less time hurt less 2nd shot way side effects stop. Driving twice to/from another state statistically dangerous teenager contracting COVID. 835 hospitalizations/132deaths. 122million fully vaccinates.

Less 0.01%. Also generalized information, J&amp;J, discussing context.

You technically correct I'm sure goal right.

The vaccines 99.999993% hospitalization death. live Texas, outskirts San Antonio, almost year seen single person indoors without mask. gov rescinded mask order March would maybe seen one two every 2nd 3rd trip HEB. CDC said vaxxed peeps could ditch mask, almost immediate half half. catch year science, kids rarely impacted virus. never, rarely.

So good take masks. r/iamverysmart reality, half Americans received first dose, number climbs every first dose, anywhere 50% efficacy climbs every day high 90% time receive second.

In reality, vaccination percentage significantly higher 37%.  someone immunocompromised, fully vaccinated still likely living fear pandemic considerably longer Americans wish employers would proactive retrofitting existing spaces' HVAC systems increase circulation fresh air workspaces least invest better filtering technology. 

Unfortunately cheap easy due likely require extensive governmental aide new employee safety regulations actually teeth. U.S. grapples supply shortage construction industry already massive shortage HVAC contractors -- one wonder many decades take implemented scale. Cost architects, HVAC designers, permitting/governmental review would also hike price tag initiative. people can't wear one, people wear one.

I'm grateful actually respected people. agree.  Rules thee, me. peons must wear them. Looks like might contagious even b.1.1.7. Luckily immune/vaccine evasive we've seen knew day coming. Businesses preparing day months now. I‚Äôve noticed liberal friends (I‚Äôm liberal well) absolutely refuse give mask despite fully vaccinated. know people need little time JFC I‚Äôm literally one hyped shit winding down.  worry it‚Äôs literally political shouldn‚Äôt been, never been. Alright boys! Lock back down!!! counties 20% vaccinated even though vaccines easily available adults since mid March. Maybe people come senses hold breath. completely fine rather making minimum wage workers uncomfortable shift.  Bigger. FDA approval force public university military vaccinations too. It‚Äôs funny people claimed YEAR ago didn‚Äôt care covid going move lives. became obsessed. point. actively arguing against** no-mask wearing judging us following rules (i.e. masks). could absolutely care less whether others want wear masks. try shame us without masks attaching fucking political identity it. state makes another wave It‚Äôs frustrating someone know fully vaccinated still want masks, even alone. It‚Äôs frustrating goes science, similar way anti-vaxxers do. It‚Äôs frustrating limits someone amount connection built experiences had, (most importantly) **unnecessarily so**.  justifiable reason universal mask mandate state country. think waiting twelve days Massachusetts absurd, indefinite insane. I‚Äôm little confused. 94% good enough you, 97% good enough child? Even so, last time TX Monday zero deaths? way look this, awesome news. Yeah, future probably going bad anyway  Antibodies blood. still get infected. Vaccine may prevent severe case. tell scared wear one? hope give hell tongue lashing. Corporate say want, turn away money mean customers put minor inconvenience couple months 

What happens end couple months would allow mask mandates lifted? political economical costs would enormous compared vaccinating population though.  lot people worried 'what vaccinated people wear masks?', well anti-vaxxers going wear masks anyways doing, people gotten vaccine yet whatever reason (busy, allergic, young) continue wear masks. think much change except smaller percentage honest fully vaccinated people wearing masks. That's said ""when possible"".

Ordering things online thing too, reduce need parents drive places. too. don‚Äôt need wear mask PA anymore you‚Äôre vaccinated, per CDC guidelines, last Friday. PA followed CDC announcement almost immediately.

Edit clarify, I‚Äôm disputing 70% thing PA drop masks regardless vaccination status, making clear PA following CDC guidelines whereas NJ still requiring vaccinated people wear masks. They‚Äôre different rules.   one vaccinated died covid? That's definitely true.  fucking way unless it‚Äôs Superior Ashland. Hilariously untrue. Yup. haven‚Äôt learned ‚Äústick man‚Äù yet, thank goodness, haha.  don‚Äôt know got Joker it‚Äôs wild  consent vaccine age majority? Canada get vaccine teenager without parents approval Again, dont get it. arent going to. single month father take kid store option extra risk people like selfish. equivalent person sped red light. I'm including ""no masks fully vaccinated"" I'm fully vaccinated. don‚Äôt get either. sub surely changed since last year. trolls full force. Apparently people live outside something call society. words, much vaccines help, older age group.

No, talking efficient 1 shot is. Older people gotten shots now, sort moot point relation Target removing mask requirement.

I feel like purposely obtuse. anti-vaxx?   think they‚Äôre slightly less likely contagious adults, I‚Äôm remembering right. oldest niece (11) it. put master bedroom she‚Äôd bathroom, let play video games watch movies week. Nobody else house got sick.  Oh mighty spirit please watch infants, know don‚Äôt capacity reason.  I'll honest. dont even know anyone who's even hospitalized. keep news believe stats know disastrous is. doesnt mean everyone will. Imagine using argument construction site. Woah think got one summer 2019. suddenly came it. Got headache lost voice span couple hours feeling fine. sick couple weeks fever phlegm stuffed up. regain voice month. Even breathing function feel 100% couple months. Technically PA same‚Äîthey're mostly going CDC guidance current plan removal ""70% fully vaccinated"" knows when/if happen.

Also far NY goes, Wednesday say people vaccinated go around maskless, ""masks completely lifted they'll longer businesses""? thoughts exactly point even severe health impacting consequences could extremely life altering.   STILL THINGS ALLOW PERSONAL CONSENT. Yeah watch 28 Days Later instead. hell anything? Maybe, may shocking, conditions changing generally much safer January.

Or possibly escape you?

Want know what's changed since January? city local case covid month county roughly 10 deaths total since February, weather better everyone outside anyway, oh one small one...IM VACCINATED

Fuck anti-vaxxers, generally anti mask mandate (mandate, whatever want, keep it, get wearing mask...I simply care do) might little earned point we've done amazing job vaccination. 

There always limit low long people could keep mitigation measures. Okay, keep capacity restrictions couple weeks. mask mandate end today. medically justified reason vaccinated person wear mask, going change two weeks now.  get real rationale behind position. Selfishness.

Not sure goal posts moved, CDC exactly wanted, congratulations, breathe people /r/agedlikewine 

We started giving 12+ vaccine Thursday. LOTS kids coming since then, NW Ohio. mean. know many nurses havent signed it. Teachers, nurses, etc still regular people. Yep true getting 2 vaccines mean immune coronavirus forever?

I read somewhere need get vaccination every year...

Cause virus going go anywhere soon. completely twisting people saying here. People saying ignoring CDC recommendation applies (fully vaccinated Walmart Texas example) continuing wear masks going science.

Which fine, scared, wear mask day long, private fear shouldn‚Äôt drive public policy. 

Being afraid flying perfectly fine, don‚Äôt fly don‚Äôt want to, science tells us flying safe method transportation. don‚Äôt know, wash butt? quotes difference vaccinated unvaccinated. words, much vaccines help, older age group.

Again, important info, right? people honorable wear mask aren‚Äôt vaccinated, right?! 
/s 

The CDC complete joke needs gutted least layers down, starting top. another day then. going wear mask make dinner home? Clearly paying attention first time Abbott ended mask mandates precautions. don't, make shit miserable cause got hobbies, friends, family enjoy around. safest thing would avoid driving possible. State required masks awhile people still wore businesses required them

Exactly. bit nobody seems get; plenty people think masks work, needed, etc. still wear they're kind psycho shows /r/publicfreakout screaming mask mandates.

They wear get get peace go day. required, won't. End story. UK almost certainly going back normal June 21st.  Nothing measures took ""basic"". halted production, closed public places even locked people apartments Can't believe wrote story guy clearly take proper precautions early on, caught virus, wildly overcompensating. man moron. newsworthy.  Yeah makes perfect sense. probably enforce less gives much needed competitive edge. one Mexican place near doesn‚Äôt enforce overly crowded spaces

Are talking individual level societal level? 

Avoiding overly crowded spaces like restaurants, bars, public transit, concerts, etc. high price pay society IMO never happen avoid flu spread. individual level, want many people make risk catching situations people things. people want protected, instead abandoned?

This soon, people stupid.  point discuss here. grace like that. also billions safe 1. people like take immune supressing drugs die double lung transplant? protect anti vax anti maskers? I‚Äôm going wear mask (I wear two masks low profile goggles actually) forever rate. vaccine never fully effective I‚Äôm super high risk complications death know, whole double lung transplant thing.

Anti vax anti mask extensions ableism point.  I‚Äôve never seen store enforce since started.  Television, news, friends state decided something fun exciting lift mandate 20th June states birthday. stuff came we‚Äôre last state lift restrictions. someone help decide chart? I‚Äôm seeing day 56 data driver %55 initial participants? Plus confidence band is.. wide. I‚Äôm OP here. im trying feel good J&amp;J pouring studies watching discussion reapproval weeks ago, talk around janessen getting many people poked possible. Honestly could give f everyone else point I‚Äôm concerned personal safety feel like got swindled.(especially site signed didn‚Äôt tell us till day vaccine was). everyone also pushes ‚Äú gonna die!‚Äù line that‚Äôs scares here. don‚Äôt want long term effects, I‚Äôd like brain liver penis COVID free feeling like J&amp;J isn‚Äôt gonna me. think original study apparently done follow read Times years back unsure study original controlled factors like. 70+ people gotten shots. bulk people 1 pfizer/moderna age range. figured discussion occurring int context masks coming off. Makes sense given fact even 1 shot Pfizer Moderna still efficient J+J shot *is* bad thing. people acting like pandemic over, despite still much present. lead cases, *almost* final stretch.  hope gym go Brooklyn quickly adapts following new guidelines. hate working mask.  
 
This welcome news, scared Cuomo would drag feet much longer this. I'm optimistic, can't reasonably assume 10% entirely distinct vaccinated population, real immunity bit lower. (that said, could also skewed large number untested cases early last year) Damn got birding 'This pen' covid

[Here's quick video Pretty stupid, though wonder many Japanese people actually buy it. figure there's lot dumb stuff television everywhere, right? Except for, know, inevitable mutations going continue occur. Shoes essential, obvious benefits actually feel good. Seatbelts fine. Sometimes they‚Äôre annoying, benefits outweigh negatives.

That case masks. Masks awful. hearing impaired, require seeing peoples lips able understand they‚Äôre saying. past year able communicate public. thought keeping now, even though promised could get rid vaccines available, it‚Äôs like nightmare scenario me.

People like keep saying things like ‚Äújust months‚Äù or, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre almost there.‚Äù Bullshit. goalposts moved many times. can‚Äôt take anymore. 30 million hearing impaired Americans situation.

So take obsessive safetyism, get it. ÔøºÔøºÔøº FB while, year next month. honestly say one best decisions I've made. people saying mask mandate made control us? want see guys stand However, much less effective preventing asymptomatic mild infections.

aka reaching real herd immunity  ridiculous arbitrary. most-vulnerable group.

I gave bunch studies. range gamut, small large sample sizes, different age groups, different methodologies. Hospitalizations among age 70+ important info, right? handled first wave, think would worry variant. full hardcore lockdown, giant prefab hospitals, literally lock people homes done month  crazy, yes good run.  don‚Äôt understand everyone forgets kids. Science says can‚Äôt get vaccinated yet, they‚Äôve eligible couple weeks therefore can‚Äôt possibly fully protected yet.

To clear, I‚Äôm vaccinated, adults family vaccinated. 5 children 12 can‚Äôt get yet. crazy trying suggest animosity towards China. plan SARS install temperature scanning passengers, removed airports ever since. security airports tightened everything else ran usual past year, despite countries Malaysia Vietnam picking positive cases Taiwan multiple times. always 'we made screening test close contact, found infections', everyone knows that's bullshit given nature disease.

&amp;#x200B;

Taiwan tried keep successful facade get seat WHA, didn't, said stuff finally started testing. That's seeing now. people smug berate still wearing masks. completely absurd - 'for vaccinated people'. Knowing 1/2 country pretended covid exist actively resisting wearing masks.

Even getting vaccine, feel like safe around groups indoors. don‚Äôt actually care idiotic society thinks anything much. stand gain right now? Meijer midwest thing. Idk still enforced last summer. Maddow literally said rewire brain tell ‚Äúpeople don‚Äôt wear masks aren‚Äôt threat‚Äù Getting ready book first shot Ontario 30+ camp tomorrow! :0)  extremely Canadian response. got okay immunity two weeks first dose, though, enough protect low-risk settings like grocery stores. One bright side people seem getting vaccine way better sure. Texas sure hurtle clear soon. Literally 1B people gotten vaccine, so... 6 months, people vaccinated one deadly disease. still numerous deadly diseases there, need stay masked truly empathetic. sisters waited walk-ins available, got second doses Friday. least two weeks past first dose now, really trying. came across bit jerk, clearly bias. 

His basic point insane use doses AZ we've got, though, bang on. BC, planning use AZ get 2nd doses, there's that. interesting experience sure. Constant uncertainty winter wave playout - doctor perform surgery (we knew ahead time would surgery)? able make hospital (our city great shape)? locked home except pediatrician checkups, restarting ""will get symptoms"" counter.

However, worst sort survivor guilt something. Throughout still feel super uncomfortable talking enjoying cozy WFH jobs company- later state-sponsored parental leave, people around going hell losing everything - loved ones, jobs, etc. Target: Fuck human lives, gotta satisfy shareholders turn 99c clearance rack. Besides, date it‚Äôs like 200x loss American lives compared 9/11 big deal right? think people may forgetting children locked group throughout pandemic. shut schools, sports, playgrounds, etc almost immediately large number children, they‚Äôre still wearing mask school sitting six feet apart cohorts. kid‚Äôs little league team still kids masked. Therefore, comparing normal flu year last year Covid kids bit misleading.  kroger never requiring masks. they'd ask thats it. 

now sign says please wear mask shopping, along masks. honestly feel like *more* people kroger wearing masks before. 

which really tells something fucking childish people really are. someone ""bossing"" them. literally willing die hill, along killing others. Following literal scientific information pandemic superior option ignoring it. Sure. Feeling smug yet? probably feel superior one way another too.  opt-in? Boy glad saw comment! suuuure town. would agree this, really much reaction either. first Pfizer shot left arm sore days nasty bruise like two weeks. second shot arm sore next day nothing far bruise. Tomorrow, 14 days since second vaccine. anything (other stuff that's illegal), still pandemic? go shopping, eat restaurants, go movie theaters, drink bars, ride public transportation, etc. without worry covid? sisters got second doses different location first, mass vaccination site operating reduced hours work them. call around couple pharmacies find one Pfizer taking walk-ins. Preprint articles require higher degree scrutiny rigor accurately evaluate many types articles. kind discussion would appropriate strictly scientific subreddit /r/COVID19.

If comfort, think relatively people actually enjoy wedding night simply fatigue. live mask aggressive county WI. went hour north rural area get vaccine early April got yelled trying smell dry shampoo cap, without spraying it, mask. time went back 2nd dose, tons people walking around mask-less. bizarre change pace. chart right contains number active cases detected weekly PCR Antigen: highest number 300 cases.

I'm still waiting eyes feast-ed. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs sociopathic. won‚Äôt hang antivaxxers, especially measles outbreak, would make exception covid? don‚Äôt hang openly racist cultily religious people either.

Exaggeration, right? No, that‚Äôs summary coworker said chatting phone. Along believing vaccine would make infertile. I'm still wearing mask. hate people much ü§£ store workers? others cannot vaccinated yet? feel like puts others risk. keep mask on. vaccinated adult even don‚Äôt want go back work unvaccinated folks. Vaccine made requirement unless disease/allergy doesn‚Äôt allow get it. I‚Äôm going give week two see happens infection rate. told true vaccine keeps hospital. sure want risk giving grandma mom covid honest yourself. feel superior. superior. Yeah, got way, wearing mask fall. helps ensure there's vocal pushback crowd. likely lol Thanks effort put this. look post every day see doing. sick people ones need wear them, anyway.

At least flu, pre-symptomatic contagious period really short, there's less need everyone act though we're infected time.

That's problem COVID along. sick know it. That's precisely virus spreads.

Even pre-vaccine, sick, really need mask. problem *always* impossible prove sick.

With ordinary flu colds, easier. guess think convince people get vaccinated

Not judging guess, that's thinking terrible assumption. personally think absolutely premature continue wearing mask. üòÇüòÇüòÇ

i lol'd  *YES*. idea masks ‚Äújust piece cloth‚Äù ludicrous insulting me. They‚Äôve caused unspeakable amounts depression, anxiety, TMJ past year, fact they‚Äôre quickly going away makes want cry relief. (If university work announces maskless fall semester, probably cry ‚Äî feel like I‚Äôve holding breath fourteen months.)

And got vaccine whopping *two days* phase became eligible. Yeah, apply kind risk assessment across life generally? find hard believe. care people frankly care people think I'm doing. I'm waiting mandate county drop need wear gym really. US officials come leave without quarantine. Almost everything sourced months old ? reason would rules stringent cdc. Same. Today's nationwide cases down, % decrease much less previous weeks. We're going see fallout week two. feel like going superspreader events, inevitably (see recent photos packed sports stadiums), given mask mandates dropped distancing well. Walked Target today. Sign outside said masks required enter. I‚Äôm NJ them?

If Covid killed harmed unacceptable amount children (unacceptable population writ large), we‚Äôd perpetual lockdown.

You can‚Äôt kids dying Covid abortion.

A statistically small portion deaths children; that‚Äôs politicians care dying old. Old, brown, &amp; poor people expendable, didn‚Äôt get hint now? would imagine large amount still making simply dodnt realize restriction lifted keep saying need deactivate. I'll uninstall app reinstall it. need pull plug, bet mental health would improve drastically. ü§£ MATH.  pause Google numbers. didn‚Äôt realize death toll high. Jesus that‚Äôs awful. Luckily didn‚Äôt lose family Covid still huge impact. work weeks month, getting severely ill, stress fighting unknown sickness. rough I‚Äôm thankful pandemic taken seriously (current) state. infuriating, NZ citizen, largely/likely similar timeline hitched wagon Australia form travel bubble, spells another Christmas/summer spent away aging family, even though pandemic almost US.

There's certain bloody minded masochism goes sticking elimination strategy pretty clear world never rid COVID. That‚Äôs good. picked good source. could gone much, much worse.  Whoa! It‚Äôs coming everywhere I‚Äôm fully vaccinated live NY continue use mask everywhere go even vaccinated people getting covid recently players vaccinated Yankees tested positive.   point gotta move on. Every adult want's vaccine get blame target forgot bashing America. Home Depot today message periodically playing music still requiring masks even you‚Äôre vaccinated. doesn‚Äôt. trials showed 95 percent efficacy, reported breakthrough cases 1 per 10,000 fully vaccinated people, 99.99 percent efficacy. Even 1 10 breakthrough cases reported CDC, efficacy would still 99.9 percent. Bottom line, chances getting Covid getting fully vaccinated minuscule. gotten much mild cold past year, like many people saying. also barely worn mask distanced. often people get sick?  That's true NZ too. go months without community cases. still urged test cold flu symptoms all. told vital several thousand tests performed every day around country sure. true Australia. That's ""open up"" crowd want hear it. Prior COVID-19, ever wear mask (ie, outside inpatient facility)? not? WILL, HAVE, places like LA, across nation ""fear"" (legitimate) going hospital directly responsible otherwise preventable death. ""excess deaths"" going important understand full impact pandemic, directly attributable disease viral load exceeded detection threshold. e.g., including suicides too.

I mention respect Amish: choose live life without electricity, like alarm clocks, even without medicine, agree respect personal choice, long forced upon anyone else (unlike Unibomber similar ideals, took aspect choice away people). (Full disclosure, I've heard even many Amish actually make exception go ahead accept many medicines even vaccines - though that's somewhat beside point). gets two-faced nature someone makes one decision - like turn back modern medicine offers - things get bad sudden obvious point can't comfortably ignore anymore, sudden change minds. people understand psychology KNOW going happen, just...let it. Though else supposed do? Give people vaccine force? Tell stop coming hospitals, first make effort taking vaccine?

It's *almost* like together, like not, one person's actions affects another person's outcome. longer ""free"" please, bc many nutjobs running around taking choices away me. Like kids go school get shot - ""land free"", remarkably free die (and worse, suffer horribly prior - even survivors utterly changed life).

I feel situation family, that, one-off situation, instead playing across entire nation. Nurses can't afford stay home, bc pay low, rent prices across country gone much, outstripping wages. merely one example disappearing middle class going turn around affect us ALL, regardless personal incomes (well, okay, entire hospital wing might less affected most) - e.g., many mothers can't afford daycare stay home watch kids school home, rash businesses across country (Chipotle, McDonald's, etc.) can't get enough workers even stay open (though part choice: e.g. Chipotle somehow manages keep online app ordering going, pay money less food, requires greater number workers, like delivery drivers - primarily people pay remain unaffected, least afford bear brunt disruption).

I'm saying: vulnerable. nation's systems ""robust"", instead waiting slight stress throw things major chaos. like owning car 30 years old never taken checked mechanic: might want *depend* get job, important event (your wedding? imagine standing someone alter bc car start!). real life example: half gas stations North Carolina completely fuel, pipeline hack - directly - bc panic buying.

We NEED WAKE UP, realize systemic problems around us. Like zombie movie ever. also like movies: going make it. yet one them: never disease fear, stupidity people. Like someone got bit saying ""it's nothing - I'm fine"", proceeds kill everyone around turns not, fact, fine all. covid different? Someone tweeting ""hey virus like flu - give purpose I'll show you"", next tweet deathbed. Which, know people crazy - couple people Kansas literally drank bleach told man TV - happens OFTEN, affecting MANY people, turn around kill least endanger entire family - becomes one time thing, actual PATTERN.

I much faith democracy days, bc people stupid, therefore worst bosses imaginable. also help every student I've ever talked universities rural states, expressly stated intention leaving state. I've argued back - traffic less, computers work anywhere, etc... - kind brain drain effect going DECADES, leaving rural areas quite ah...""vulnerable"" deception, anyone knows anything run town, sometimes literally. sometimes outright death threats, like story man started medical college Missouri, bringing grants even fund it, people like talking community wear masks, daughter said whole family going leave - even though STARTED college, SUCCESSFUL, bringing MONEY area. MANY stories like - another mayor iirc Dodge Kansas (some famous cowboy town anyway), actually stepped bc receiving death threats similarly saying people wear masks. that's even getting worse things like governor nearly kidnapped.

How help people, actively fight efforts aid them? wish knew...bc mentioned earlier, we're together. fall together, else change rise, together. super open staff telling need take mental day cool working around HR rules take sick vacation time. wouldn‚Äôt case   Making 7 figures? would mean CEO taking care nobody stockholders. explains lot. Beijing loathe lose advantage it‚Äôs built U.S major Western economies successful containment pathogen

Oh man, wish countries tried compete other. ""We healthiest citizens!"" would awesome everybody.

With high levels wealth US, America could dominate way prioritized, might kick pants need get shit together. Problem is, still unknown long term effects asymptomatic carrier are. People act like kids completely safe, there's scary stuff found kids symptoms. Changes brain, circulatory system lungs. know changes bad think worth taking chance find out. I'm afraid kids ran around without masks, 10-20 years might serious consequences them.

I also sneaking suspicion we're going see truckload strange even fatal conditions arise people survived covid, people asymptomatic too. really pisses people downplay disease. short term thinking. keep equating flu chicken pox.... those. completely new thing, idea long term affects might be.

I'm getting second shot soon, wife hers. can't wait son it. percentage include already got sick? figure matter? Asking friend friend‚Äôs uncle in-law There‚Äôs videos people fucked shit everything anything, many times reason people insane. don‚Äôt live life fear though even give second thought. go business far good life. 

I don‚Äôt let assholes dictate approach life. Hell color skin could trigger types whatever, that‚Äôs problem, mine. Lol k  spent entire time talking data directly correlates I've saying...

You've trying refute I'm saying data supports I'm saying. Yes, it‚Äôs pretty hard watch. Going necessities hearing/watching people brag going amusement parks hard. 

We haven‚Äôt seen parents, siblings, niece nephew since pandemic began Dad recovering stroke... daughter chomping bit travel across states usual visiting ‚Äî can‚Äôt. even option even difficult. 

I think it‚Äôs important people remember different classes people stuck whole thing. everyone isn‚Äôt vaccinated group ‚Äúnot taking seriously.‚Äù everyone anti-vaxxer. We‚Äôre up-to-date shots able have. And, overly diligent mask use. sucks everyone. fianc√©‚Äôs dad big smoker currently hospital clotting Covid. He‚Äôll probably blood thinners rest life. Take shot   day local gym Mexico go M-F says masks go I'll cry real Won‚Äôt sell Pok√©mon cards they‚Äôll let people spread Corona, irony. Love it! Way believable half shift people think Collective fear stimulates herd instinct, tends produce ferocity toward regarded members herd.  Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.

I feel like change much vaccinated. People take pandemic serious well-aware anti-maskers/anti-vaxxers. think continue wear masks want associated crazies. seen quite redditors expressed sentiment unethical though anti-vaxxers keep anti-vaxxers never get vaccinated? anti-maskers everything defy mask wearing throughout pandemic. 

Not sure exactly CDC announcement changes group puts lives danger. They're based continued behavior. 

CDC announcement hopefully pushes fence sitters get moving get vaccinated. true anti-vaxxer/masker crowd unsafe whole time changing. Two weeks we'll huge spike covid cases. customers?

If target started that, would stop going Target.  Lmao Thank goodness.

I'm betting COVID essentially America summer solstice.    Counterpoint: household spread huge way Covid spreading... People houses wear masks. Doubt many studies teased exactly vaccinated people gotten specifically. people continue masking avoiding crowds later date. vast, vast majority people access capability get vaccine. Life stop small fringe group. Wow. live near DC virtually everyone mask inside stores time. Ok, get low-grade version, let's say low-grade even get symptoms, unknowingly pass kids work young get vaccine? roommate vaccinated, immunosuppressant drugs vaccine may effective her? maybe ""low-grade"" version still dangerous I'm overweight diabetes inflammatory auto-immune disease?

I mean, also tend get overheated easily, would LOVE wear masks anymore summer starting heat up, feel safe since state still 30% fully vaccinated, there's going potentially infected contagious people walking around masks lie pretend they're vaccinated. yet - I‚Äôm eligible country vaccine yet. Treatment plan salt, water, beta blockers... Especially since everything else ending 15th anyway...it makes sense lump it. Cdc garbage now. manipulated say said. Economy first America matter. CDC‚Äôs important advice new statement unvaccinated still need masked. road there's terrible side-effect linked vaccines? There's already young people who've gotten blood clots vaccines likely would a-OK COVID. people like something stress reason. It‚Äôs like therapeutic constantly fearing death Even though found covid rarely spreads surfaces, I'm really happy improvements hygiene disinfecting. I'm usually good two nasty colds year, one since fall 2019. highly, highly dependent practice/hospital/organization work in. Doctors US kept overly busy patient visit time charting. MD/DO programs little emphasis public health training review medical research. organizations consider research literacy part job, isn‚Äôt something would call terribly common.

Many physicians follow guidance professional associations (in case, American Academy Pediatrics big one) it‚Äôs like recommendations trade secret available physicians. Often AAP big groups reference (so tldr ‚Äúyeah CDC said‚Äù). big groups also walking tightrope cautious public messaging CDC. 

So say... doctor expected expert lots things adjacent public health, typically isn‚Äôt job expert cutting edge research. Whether choose stay current depend entirely individual degree place work encourages supports this. mean, like garbage studies, said ""mandate protect religious constitutional freedoms"" like bad thing. point asking would see vax cards. I‚Äôm vaccinated, however it‚Äôs still 100% effective. I‚Äôm continuing wear mask time being. hope time get married end year Seeing death statistics sourcing misleading, statement probably too.

It's also entirely irrelevant. We're talking coronavirus vaccines risk/benefit vaccination disease. fine before. They‚Äôll fine credentials relevant experience? No, I'm hearing vaccinated people need wear mask.

I'm vaccinated so... Dude garbage titles.....they adopting CDC latest guidelines.....when people actually meet them.... 
We meet yet....in new york 50% new yorkers ONE dose...we're even close majority people 2 weeks second shot. sensationalist headlines making sound like already like 70% people doses 2 weeks passed still lift it. case. chill out, past months nothing negative hate. positive news? British Columbia cited supply shortage announcing Wednesday would stop using AstraZeneca first dose. Saskatchewan also said stopped use AstraZeneca lack supply.

How surprising, AstraZeneca can't fulfill orders. Good happens unvaccinated people make mutated covid start back people impatient weak hold correct percentage it? Enjoy lol that's Americans you. Trust science. That‚Äôs saying suddenly CDC something don‚Äôt like Also, latest [Angus Reid shows 82% Canadian adults already received first dose intend get soon possibly can. 9% say want it, that's decreasing. seem impression vaccines available aren‚Äôt effective evidence shows that‚Äôs even close case. Case rates dropping US, low UK extremely low Israel, mainly due vaccines.

Why think it‚Äôs nearly impossible humans develop effective vaccine hasty manner? Science advanced years gone by.

And idk comparing AIDS Covid terms ‚Äúchanging live.‚Äù Practice safe sex abstinence never get AIDS. exactly major lifestyle change lot people. What‚Äôs mortality rate children? positively certain change summer basically colleges reconsider decision reopen fall. guy right. employer need say ""I'm firing black"" successfully win lawsuit discrimination. Specifically still use circumstantial statistical evidence.

While standard circumstantial evidence high, impossible.

For example, Griggs vs Duke Power employees successfully suit certain test discriminated black employees promoting correlation passing test good point reason ""work culture"" reason fit ""you're old"" counts age discrimination. particular concern vaccine (and list particular vaccine) I‚Äôll respond requested information It'll probably happen Wednesday night Thursday latest word you‚Äôre looking ‚Äúaltruistic‚Äù. It‚Äôs certainly generous. justification speaking children though still people. child person ""someone."" true movie classic. agree least Mass Cali dates. Jersey doesn‚Äôt even money üí∞ü§ë.

I'm fucking tired privileged work home-rs India suffering worse Covid-19. Yet states ready lift mask mandate putting many people danger. CVS employee already got arrested selling fake Covid-19 vaccine cards . say people get ahold fake cards. wear mask. definitely see spike number cases.  always wearing ski masks Wisconsin? people can‚Äôt get vaccine point asking? People would probably lie anyway?

The important thing is, vaccinated? so, really see concern. protected. 

If one anti vax person gives another, problem. comment you, comment mathematical illiteracy U.S. I'm willing bet average vaccine-denier also one would choose one million dollars doubling beginning penny every day month. People really understand exponential growth works we're finally meeting existential threat follow too-familiar linear trends we're intuitively used to.

Also, fun thought experiment: beginning pandemic (let's say unhindered death rate increase would remained way everyone went life), jumped 10k deaths/week (4/4/2020) 16k deaths/week (4/11/2020). 160% increase, would sitting equation growth rate 1.6. wrote simple little script take extrapolate many weeks would taken 15 million people die:

`week 2: 16003`

Granted, entirely unhindered probably assume logistic growth instead account herd immunity, frequency novel contact individuals, etc.. combined enough drop simple linear growth. fact able *reverse* trend 100% economic shut getting people stay indoors. northeast also well. expect midwest states like Oregon, Washington, Hawaii Colorado come around too.

Yeah thats rural America hs descended cess pool ignorance bigotry. stupid racist literally entire cultural identity conservatives now. sonic adventure 2 best sonic game series

&amp;#x200B;

mania pretty overrated imo Actually completely safe community spread drops double digit type numbers metro areas due mask use coupled vaccines. state still 600 daily cases. Thats shit masking forever protect immune compromised.

Who said mask forever? speak immunocompromised? live city still enforced.  Yeah, sometimes think NJ irrational, look across pond Europe see worse things there.  Booking system vaccination: see got keep job covid. People got keep job last year get luxury lecturing little ""suffering"" others had. doesn‚Äôt even make sense eua vaccines nothing safety, long term efficacy. two stores near one required masks didnt (for fully vac peeps), I‚Äôd go latter. feels good mask free months post removed cannot verify reliable source.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* anyone say 100%? state still 700 daily cases dozens daily deaths. lives matter?

Im masking till cases 100 fitting rooms back? Pleaseeee  That's right. Biden thank infrastructure. want take after, you. I'll taking mine too. stop threatening people wanting remain masked up. 
 
Come take it! Okay guess reiterate since don‚Äôt understand. NEVER said you‚Äôre video ‚Äúinfluencer fluff‚Äù legitimate... making joke social media general saw opportunity linked Instagram video... all. great night may sky daddy watch üôèüèº OK. I'll check workplace's policy different departments (I part-time seasonal tutor, faculty security anyone else usually qualifies full-time benefits pre-COVID days). ever, we've known nearly year. people still unsure actual facts around Covid? Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* number lie. like 4400 self reported deaths VAERS. mean people died vaccine. means reported death sometime vaccination. 8000 people die day US.    Yep. guess don‚Äôt know he/she counts northern WI. Maybe thinking Eau Claire, Wausau Appleton/GB. don‚Äôt consider places northern Wisconsin. 

I say liberals apostle islands area that‚Äôs guessed maybe Ashland.
Northern Wisconsin still largely conservative way Hayward (for example) Walmart 99% masked lol Long term effects Covid?
Don‚Äôt get Covid then. Wear mask take vax. 

It‚Äôs literally you. That's horrifying. numbers quoted reported deaths vaccine given. deaths caused vaccines. conflating two. People die time unrelated reasons statistic useful determining vaccine safety.

The CDC explicitly states statistic relationship vaccines risk death. see verified flair you, I'm going take comment grain salt.

I think verified medical professional would say anything definitively. That‚Äôs fine still many places required people need wear regardless got vaccine   unintended consequence, feature. Herd immunity one way other. Get vaccinated get covid. We‚Äôve interacted 5 6 daycares LA past year, require masks 2 years above. 37 cant get vaccine maybe 2-3 months EU. I‚Äôm Germany friend is. 

He received shot keeping close Whatsapp contact GP. Apparently one fine day, GP messaged morning cancellation 17:00hrs slot asking he‚Äôd like come in. 

As lives Frankfurt good public transport, able make available 17:00hrs jab. 

Otherwise, said waiting ‚Äúofficial‚Äù state method (complicated details), would probably mean he‚Äôd auto-selected much, much later. Good. tired hysteria misplaced priorities around risk. OCD (without germaphobia), actually okay. Although mention that, stories went viral last year people licking things/food grocery stores, almost breakdown. Well tested covid week later, chances already covid birthday vaccine wouldnt done anything anyways Whether like not, everything except J&amp;J 2-dose regimen. 1-dose results studied trials Pfizer Moderna, data randomized setting make conclusions. 

It's hard wait fully vaccinated. Oh yes, see strawman *constantly*. call it, too.  Imagine world got pulled cop simply asked licensed driver, didn‚Äôt ask see proof. There‚Äôs person alive wouldn‚Äôt lie get ticket. 

Of course people going lie. 

This title silly... want know experts are, exactly qualifications make bold claim. People hesitant get AZ can't get Pfizer due Biontech contract Fosun.

That leaves Moderna option JJ clot issue. Sadly, there‚Äôs people like girlfriend whose immunosuppressants vaccine won‚Äôt much efficacy. rheumatologist says can‚Äôt take she‚Äôs tapered steroids chemo. People like us feel kind forgotten. hope enough people get vaccinated point slows city us relax little. problem everyone say vaccinated even not, that‚Äôs considering asked probably won‚Äôt be. Also vaccine doesn‚Äôt make immune, I‚Äôll still wearing mask stores. even trigger autoimmune disease, cytokine storms played large role bad covid cases? actual brigading. mods related covid sub literally confirmed lockdown ""skeptics"" running organized brigading campaigns. see signs everywhere. clearest pattern I've seen try hit smaller posts, get drowned reasonable voices post gets popular enough. Tucker Carlson literally told viewers harrass people wearing masks. They'll anything says that's good right? means echo chamber. maybe multiple nodes resonance. Well they've change shit. may need keep changed. already covid? dont want vaccine? One issue people covid dont think vaccine isnt needed since got covid fine.   face book since 2015... liked MySpace lol Awful idea. basically means masks, anyone say vaccine even don‚Äôt. Personally I‚Äôm still going wearing one, honestly don‚Äôt even mind covering face anymore, I‚Äôve gotten used it. want hear shot fine, got ASAP eligible, day shot #2 kicked ass sideways. Woke 3am cold sweats headache eyeballs back head felt like I‚Äôd drank beer Oktoberfest. Took Tylenol+aspirin put cold rag forehead, passed 10am, spent rest day thanking stars booked day dozed on.

Totally worth getting vaccinated, needle almost unnoticeable, god damn I‚Äôve literally felt acutely sick since swine flu 2009.   Yup. Same. JNJ put zip code. Long covid thing fully vaccinated. get sick it'll either asymptomatic something close headache. That's it. Long covid severe illness protected completely. Also basically can't spread virus either yeah safe take mask off. Enjoy life. It‚Äôs also perfectly reasonable hold government officials agencies account. agreed rationale sensibility instituting mask mandates, doesn‚Äôt lock agreeing every single subsequent action take. It‚Äôs sign healthy accountability don‚Äôt blindly immediately accept statement ‚Äúthey‚Äôre side.‚Äù don‚Äôt live small conservative city Honestly, lot people feel way. Im vaccinated understand people dont want get one. What‚Äôs people comments posts vs people thread? ‚Äúwe never take masks even though vaccinated‚Äù flock threads. Weird.    mean TV studios bring back studio audiences soon along talk shows ending 6 feet apart rule hosts? know NBC's ""Today"" first so. I'd like say research, please rely one report/study. still feel unsafe, please wear mask practice safe distance practice - personally think outside safer inside keep 6 feet inside less outside. think best health loved ones. 

And anti-masks, please leave wear mask. decision keep on. Good news. type race truly teams cross finish line. teams around world, actually. Personal safety isn‚Äôt issue. may bit selfish I‚Äôd rather see 4th close person die COVID join others wearing mask. country would enforce rules whole thing could‚Äôve 2-3 months hard quarantine rest could‚Äôve lax. enough supply Netherlands moment. Janssen AstraZeneca failing deliver difference made extra order Pfizer/BioNTech doses. Texan, wonderful news, take away heartbreak knowing dear friend lost 18 year old sister Covid Friday. sure day death would actually show data. literally worked Walmart 2 years high school worked another retail job bookstore year half okay 100%. speaks mind treats audience grownups. wonder things would different charge CDC NIAID. Rip everyone works tourism True. may way since it‚Äôs inception tbh. Sucks make wearing mask cough/cold normal social expectation. I've really enjoyed multiple horrible colds every year. Already vaccinated. even vaccinated still chance getting Covid. Well even alive first half pandemic kid treatments developed, affected way.

But yes new. 

Israel never (as far know) Indian variants. do, see well vaccines fare, would dictate rest world deal with.

Also never vaccine MERS SARS 1. wonder is. coronavirus ever vaccine developed before. new. 

I happy spot now. stranger things happened. must work retail. statements always technically correct 

They even going them. start pandemic advised wearing masks. lack evidence masks work, afraid people would buy N95's. Same.  person sounds like angry one Rural WI Walmarts did.  soon okay  N95s fully vaxxed... way. Ask likes lung damage. says ""no"", get shot. figured lifting mask mandate soon bad idea.  cases dropping fast they've dropping end delaying results? Perfect timing, that's right hit 2 weeks second. also clarify good number colleges opening campus least *some* classes activities. figure UC CSU dorms open Fall. I‚Äôm excited woo! Great news! Now, lets Canadians come tell us much US sucks. because. dad loyal Rachel Maddow viewer believes everything spews. Texas lifted mask mandate raging TV saying Abbott ""bloody idiot"".

Zero new deaths today. Crowds back enjoy sports. He's quiet today. Thank . There's lot people lh groups got shot WaPo published anedotal data cure they're living pain regret. I'm advised virologist steer clear cytokines chill. 14 months chilled yet. üòî friend mine works dentist's office Anaheim, always masks still got tested positive weeks ago. possible got else where, want remind everyone careful value health others. rely one study, study safe feel safe cautious.  surprising considering CDC collaborated every turn issue guidance leading widespread infection. worry, enough data yet! Science!  üëç k Disappointed Target. live AZ, I‚Äôm vaccinated. go Target realize wearing mask makes look like I‚Äôm vaccinated. remember it‚Äôs Arizona. look like don‚Äôt fit in. course people lie vaccinated. long *you* fully vaccinated, it‚Äôs irrelevant whether people lie far personal safety goes. odds getting covid minimal, odds getting covid symptoms worse cold infinitely small, odds hospitalized dying practically nonexistent. 

Statistically, they‚Äôre quite literally one million chances. 1 15,300 chance struck lightning lifetime, reference, 1 103 chance dying car accident. 

Especially choose still wear mask, people lying vaccination status irrelevant personal safety. also hate needles, practically skipped vaccination site. weakest shot I've ever felt too. Yeah, know. hoping would change mind today, especially Cuomo changed his, guess not. :(

I'm 100% pro-science, CDC says return normal we're vaccinated, every right so. going trust, national organization public health, one politician? problem me, problem saying vaccinated means go back normal. Covid deniers anti-vaxxefs going lie. CDC bungled communication done masks beginning. Cries expendable factory worker. top 5 Covid deaths job. I'm half vaccinated, 23, healthy planning trip Canada france july 10-17.

Anyone know odds france open tourists then? take shopping trips? looking forward wearing mask see scenario I‚Äôd wear mask again. something comforting it, sure. aren‚Äôt comfortable wear hours though, wouldn‚Äôt go far. differently public AIDS epidemic/Pandemic compared measures people gone Covid? come now, comparing vaccine Spanish Flu 1920s compared vaccines developed now?? Vaccines still relatively ""new"" medicine time, comparison trying make quite silly.

Also, SARS-Cov-2 may ""novel"" subtype coronavirus around centuries. Scientists knowledge virus long time partially vaccine development fast.  Come bet snail race! Hermit islands vs. garden shore! last lift mask mandate? tell Phil Murphy.  Like person said, problem lies fact people lie vaccinated. Already I‚Äôve 3 coworkers test positive COVID. Can‚Äôt say sure vaxxed not, lot us since Target paid 4 hours per person us get shot. south, lot people anti mask anti vax Woooo!!! Countries herd immunity vaccination infection tolerate small amounts community spread can‚Äôt grow exponentially anymore. tolerate importing COVID-19. 

Here Australia, infected, vaccination slow, thanks corrupt/do-nothing federal government‚Äôs approach vaccine acquisition past year. don‚Äôt anything resembling herd immunity, community transmission isn‚Äôt held back contact tracing (which can‚Äôt handle large amounts cases), rapidly grow control, countries saw 2020. can‚Äôt open borders there‚Äôs high level vaccination. Hell yeah! Vaccinated mask free!!! Ask likes getting hit arm hammer. says yes, she'll enjoy shot too. .0000001 vs .0000002? That‚Äôs proportions talking Laughs ICU spouse‚Ä¶ saw schools one places still need wear mask, like airplanes hospitals.... change??‚ÄΩ asthma, aren‚Äôt weight, underlying conditions.

My kids reason afraid it. makes think do? thousands things far likely kill negatively effect children Covid-19. Keeping mandates place keep population *barely* effected virus makes zero sense. Kids‚Äô immune systems incredibly robust, especially comes Covid 19. 

You making choice doom family another 6 months semi isolation. CDC. No, want return functional, normal society. Australian living Australia, wholly support plan. text bellow third image, risk dying blood clots 1% 

But get blood clot AstraZeneca there's 25% chance dying

&amp;#x200B;

Now Doctor, medical degree. doctor? medical degree? even sources talking ass. You‚Äôll never get answers questions, bunch downvotes. People don‚Äôt want end. else able feel morally superior everyone else? American solution. ‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt get shot save life lives loved ones? 1 2,340,000 chance 1M?‚Äù unvaccinated people making choice infecting kids chance getting vaccine yet, people vaccine allergies people can‚Äôt get vaccine health conditions. makes hopeful. best friend's wedding summer I'm supposed groomsman, go China loosens restrictions enough make back without losing job. right, variant novel virus, *still* Covid-19, minimal changes spike. course, totally novel virus arrives, natural immunity &amp; vaccine-induced immunity work.

That would imply new pandemic though! lot travel = proximity epicenter affected areas = gravity situation CDC faces. test everyone including domestic population, would've severely overwhelmed. decision made aggressive border instead. Since early patients recovered, need aggressively test entire population instead save ammunition next wave.

You misunderstanding suggesting. I'm saying test whole population, never NZ either. I'm also talking first wave. Taiwan handle well succeeded year keeping out. 

The proximity Wuhan irrelevant current outbreak though. 

Again saying Taiwan testing everyone presents doctor cold flu symptoms. that's already done symptoms.

No been. Dr Chiou Shu-ti, former Health Commissioner said: said Taiwan ‚Äústupid‚Äù focusing testing people presented symptoms also travel history connection confirmed case, rather one other. Monday, rapid testing established Wanhua, meaning potentially many cases undetected.

‚ÄúEveryone knows Covid-19 spread onset symptoms,‚Äù said.

That comes also goes pointed three recent mass travel events could contribute spread would detected yet: 8-9 May mother‚Äôs day weekend, last weekend‚Äôs high school entrance exams, students returning home towns universities switched remote learning Sunday.

When comes testing, Australia done 684,000 per million, NZ done 416,000 per million. South Korea done 184,000 per million. Even much poorer Vietnam done 31,000 per million. countries zero-covid countries border strategy Taiwan. Yet Taiwan's testing rate 25,000 per million. nowhere close high enough provide warning community transmission late, seen. 

It whole populace, see NZ tested 41% population 15 months pandemic. Taiwan tested 2.5% population. Yep. That‚Äôs seems common sense. Thanks! North America fault people wrote article, guess. curious, honest question, live Florida saw biggest wave summer hot people love inside AC. Right now, see big number friends vaccinated move inside gatherings heat. vaccinated, curious states like mine summer could worse. Based Im turning 24 soon. long term job everyday same. dread getting get work joke ""its ok, mins Ill commuting back""... asking day went already clock time.

I hate send help ;-; get social media man. Largely bureaucracy decent levels vaccine hesitancy.  there's going new bottle neck? Vaccination center doctors vaccinate many people day there's easy way check see doctors area available appointments. People going situation blindly call every doctor area hope best. Unless, course, adapt 116117 vaccine appointments doctors willing AstraZeneca would now? stay inside, unless immunocompromised, risk hit lightning far, far greater catching virus vaccinated. I'm part! 

Would like know more?  graduated early last semester, fml I‚Äôm specialist may true, kid gets yearly flu shot cautious went flu season old enough flu shot. Plus know lot flu terms treatment potential effects. there‚Äôs things protect/treat flu. 

With Covid, sure, kid could get fine. there‚Äôs also chance could get lifelong problems it. kid‚Äôs life literally beginning don‚Äôt feel like taking risks could affect forever know lot parents kid 12 feel way. least everyone masked indoors level protection that‚Äôs gone. don‚Äôt feel like convenience able take kid store grab milk worth risk permanent cardiovascular issues everyone neighborhood‚Äôs orange god king told get vaccine hoax. 

Anecdotally, know someone whose 7 year old relatively mild case Covid beginning year still 100%. perfectly healthy kid- underlying conditions. US currently ~158m first dose, 47.5% total population 59.8% 18+ ([CDC provides handy dashboard US hit 200m *total doses given* April 16th, included lot second doses. think underestimate [how big is.  I‚Äôm fine natural selection taking place especially south tbh. It‚Äôs well made them. Maybe people worried cuz Texas lot cities one leave gets into. packed cities. problem think it‚Äôs going mutants made cities cuz stupid ant-Vader‚Äôs decided live big cities sweiously hope natural selection point Cal doctor state hotline see. Nope. There‚Äôs nothing need target ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è states‚Äô claims can‚Äôt legally require students get vaccine BS, right? Yeah even close  Slippery slope fallacy. Thanks. Good know. That‚Äôs terrible hilarious. act like something special people already vaccinated. Agreed, statement target toward religiously hesitant, everyday folk. I've yet see real explanation someone ""can't"" wear mask. fucking respirator force air through. fucking mask. It‚Äôs desperation victim 4100 1,470,000,000 doses administered..

your chances getting hit car buying winning lottery ticket same.. curbside pickup drive thru only, whatever cannot Amazon happen. second one hit little harder first, husband said didn‚Äôt feel anything second. He‚Äôd slightly sore arm degrees fever first. Lucky. I'm saying people wear masks, I'm saying normalized. Meaning people choose wear masks get harassed anti-maskers; wearing mask political statement something.

And get sick every year good you. germy kids coworkers coming work sick, think unavoidable me.    level state control ""state school"" varies lot, state law. likely state schools legally require vaccine cannot. like WWI WWII

So, late again? Sure, far less headache drop requirement. Oh, mask lovers here. knew. sure. That‚Äôs I‚Äôve heard- wanted see playing it. got recommendations must try joints cut town? Still takes 6 weeks fully vaccinated regardless. isn‚Äôt place anti- vaxx lies. Reported misinformation. I've lost respect many people pandemic. wish they'd able follow people, too. that's 95% confidence interval large - took account.  haven‚Äôt dropped yet still takes around 6 weeks fully vaccinated dude. Get grip. Yes!  statement ""How simple truth: CDC job reported scientific evidence"" set off, CDC merely report scientific evidence.

They followed ""evidence-based practices"" dogmatically, thinking limitations evidence available. directly responsible quarantines, failed implement properly. responsible guidance, lied. case, people died it.

In case, I'm sure ""real scientists"" saying. scientists listen talking guidance yet. trust CDC. got Shai-Hulud there. There's damn Paul Muad'Dib riding worm, friend. think established relationship therapist proven track record good things mental health, that‚Äôs worth *so* much *vanishingly small* chances either catching Covid point problematic symptoms. There‚Äôs guarantee could find another equally good helpful therapist, mental health worth put kind disruption. pandemic blast. certainly disconnect taking pandemic seriously getting vaccine. live city work rural area midwest. city surrounding metro area really good compliance social distancing masking, whereas rural area little compliance outside places strictly enforce it. Yet, vaccination rates same. remains significant number people taking things seriously motivated get vaccine yet. time.  I'm sure official policy this. know store cart cleaner front would tell people put masks hand one, giant sign says wear masks, also AP (security) ones ever tell people put mask inside store. However, they're constantly busy sometimes security office really see enforcing much. Google ""CDC provisional covid deaths""

You see 287 children (0-17) died covid entire pandemic.

Weekly state level data found AAP's website, looking today. Kids responsible pretty low % cases (topped 24% adult cases plummeted). 

Evidence suggests high levels resistance and/or immunity children, although CDC recognize danger young infants (same flu) want fucking medal hoarding vaccines rest world facing shortages (in small part due US export restrictions vaccines raw material) gifting surplus unapproved AstraZeneca vaccines *months* after? Kentucky also, last time saw 10+ people without masks would normally see 1 most. People definitely taking advantage stores policies stores already Understood. unvaccinated adults do, we‚Äôve given tools methods determine isn‚Äôt vaccinated. would liked see indoor masking public places vaccine availability people, least higher vaccination rates. me, guidance makes sense places higher vaccination rates, tied number/goal.   spread stopped herd immunity level changes based r number. Formula 1-(1/r).

Original Covid May r2.5. 1-(1/2.5) = 1-0.4 = 0.6 (60%).

UK variant say 70% transmittable, 2.5 x 1.7 = r4.25 76%.

Indian variant 50% transmittable, 4.25 x 1.5 = r6.375 85%.

There 54 million adults 67million people, vaccinated, 80% herd immunity. Infections add this.

R number changed depending situation, going walk reduces it, going full stadium football increases it. OSHA can't require that. Children 12 risk adverse reaction general. Additionally, concerned well being, selective send them. 

There justification forcing vaccinated adults wear masks. even super-cautious CDC agrees that. Voluntary masking still option - anyone who's unvaccinated following CDC guidance still wearing mask. following think reason believe mandate.

I give major chains removing requirement change, local stores, restaurants, etc already could. Given *no* uptick TX removed mandates, see Target removing requirement make difference. 

Ultimately, we'll know couple weeks, nothing presented reason increase cases. They've continued drop loosening restrictions past couple months.  even thing begin with? yesterday heard someone say they're going get shot wear mask work. Incentives work. Yeah, consider pediatrician's job stay date research area.

A pediatrician able read studies determine reasonable science based response tell parents ask. get different dentist. ""Some people catching despite vaccinated"" =/= ""full immunity exist""

We know vaccines 100% effective. Vaccinated adults pose threat children. I'm going pretend I'm unvaccinated would placate fears. want understand state schools say can‚Äôt require vaccine it‚Äôs fully FDA approved (just emergency authorization) states go ahead it. I‚Äôm guessing states claiming can‚Äôt require vaccines state universities lying? 90% getting vaccines also going wear masks. That‚Äôs reality. Hopefully many don‚Äôt get sick create mutant virus.  Since unvaccinated currently includes everyone age 12 nearly everyone age 16 (not enough time passed since approved) seems like rushed effort. 

I ‚Äúlucky‚Äù higher risk group could sign March state. didn‚Äôt enough takers. Many states started opening younger adults enough time passed fully vaccinated yet either. movies releases slowed crawl though It‚Äôs horrible look, it‚Äôs abdication duty people. Happens think‚Ä¶ selective send children? high risk general. That‚Äôs gonna say! like- heard neck gaiter? help sunburns too. UPS USPS guys use them- well runners. fuck ton fedex, ups usps guys super fast runners.  Bar how? place country going legally mandate vaccination. creating market places require vaccination appeal crowd money.

You can't really force this. factors long COVID severe older overweight obesity

So that's good, right? Looks like long covid may statistically danger young kids. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

We'd right smack dab middle flu season, makes sense keep wearing 6 months that.

We could really reduce number flu deaths people masked full-time flu. also don‚Äôt know yet vaccinated means can‚Äôt transmit someone else. masks necessary everyone regardless vax history  There‚Äôs 1 Middlesboro. I. 

We sacrificed entire year come this. someone fully vaccinated, taking mask pride.  Northern Californian here, Targets area employees stationed entrances, checking masks stopping people tried get without them. Yeah live Mason asking lol. skyline, it‚Äôs horrible anything, it‚Äôs also spectacularly amazing. Probably worth hype tastes good TIL COVID danger life. father told weekend Target's managers say anything wearing masks company policy to. disagree. I‚Äôm immunocompromised scared ever. guess masses, sure, 10 million immunocompromised people country put us sacrificial lambs economy. doesn‚Äôt. towns Texas still large degree mask compliance well requirements major stores. Now, stores withdrawn mandates. It‚Äôs situation. pretty easy say refuse go work vaccine mandate 18-29...

Source: finished age range...I lost track many times said I'd refuse something work related since college...then bills came.. sub flip-floppiest sub I've seen. Feels like every week up-voted opposite prior week. believe individual choice. Wear mask great, don‚Äôt wanna wear mask also great. However used getting sick every year (and I‚Äôm hating all) really look ways improving immune system. said it‚Äôs unvaccinated would get it, vaccinated. also didn‚Äôt mention anything resistant variant. said may flare ups sort like measles flares unvaccinated people.  everyone unvaccinated able vaccinated. already packed Rangers stadium spike cases afterwards month ago. Excuse ignorance something I've wondering follow covid closely: people risk get vaccinated, safe covid right ? everyone risk gets vaccinated, point risk get vaccinated ? one transmits disease either vaccinated person person risk.  fLu ""If prefer wear mask, invite try one contact-less shopping options!"" not, feel people situation. really do. quickly getting point virus able sustain due vaccination immunity due illness. Also, I'd really look data regarding condition. conditions side effects mRNA vaccines. 
 
I'd preferred us wait July lift mask mandates 100% capacity well protection seems single shot understand lowering restrictions next month. really answer question. clear cult becoming problem. Either vaccines work incredibly well everyone get one, mostly work people fence really need get one.

??? make sense all. something mostly works, probably getting it.

Anyway, I've trouble comprehending claim encourage people go get vaccinated stop wearing mask, end result is, we're seeing topic thread, chaotic mixed messages required wear mask (""single grocery store corp lifts requirement unless local rules override it""). one verifying actually got vaccinated door given public place (it'd absurd try), people got enough hall monitor conscience going bother want get before.

The people never believed going use excuse go unmasked potentially cause upswing virus yet again. Meantime, people inbetween doses waiting appointment time, people immunocompromised.

But guess people matter vague guess people willingly go get vaccine. mRNA vaccines don‚Äôt function way flu vaccine does. It‚Äôs completely different mechanism. submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Vaccines incredibly accessible right though USA though. young people less time, also long waits appointments. 

We're point started, question wanting to, accessible.

I know reddit likes dunk boomers, available data suggests going younger people keep percentages down. Great time third wave! Well that's silly reason wear mask. continue wear one many contexts, reason. ‚ÄúListen experts! vaccine works, get it!‚Äù

The experts: ‚ÄúOkay you‚Äôre vaccinated need mask, since vaccine works well.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe experts clue they‚Äôre talking about. Way politicized! Can‚Äôt trusted!‚Äù People hard time looking inward. look video. absurd people reacting. take step back laugh even hobby.  know cure common cold? flu vaccine changes year year always fully effective? evidence it‚Äôs thing (i.e.: virus mutation) could actually happen, observe exact phenomenon time real world That's cool. People free mask needed decide themselves.  Keep mind CDC isn‚Äôt necessarily trying reduce cases. They‚Äôre trying keep hospitalization death rates low; that‚Äôs they‚Äôve always trying do. 

Before vaccines, reducing spread way keep hospitalization death rates down. vaccines job. Somebody even one shot going much milder case catch COVID. CDC switching stance infection rates aren‚Äôt huge deal anymore, long vaccines job keeping people hospitals dying. kind thinking going allow government control lives forever. can‚Äôt fear ever little thing might threaten safety. Wearing masks reasonable response pandemic, it‚Äôs time go back normal. It‚Äôs pretty damn safe now. cannot let virus defeat us. numbers ramped last fall vaccinations begun yet, small percentage population acquired natural immunity previous infection. Now, vaccination immunity previous infection, we're much closer numbers needed herd immunity. Don‚Äôt forget also many doctors wild cater flocks. doctors solid grasp appreciation field immunology mono get second covid vaccine tomorrow? really annoying thing. i'm walmart (canada) quickly realized would never right remove unmasked stores. we've greeters get spat call manager. Yeah surprising amount people feel way Also new articles regarding cleanliness air quality different areas. Reading toxic air quality NYC subways actually are, masks always daily routine like putting pants. Thanks link! Bummer, hoping stop wearing one Airport work at.  Newsom *is* following science probably closely lot States, though, CDC guidance pretty specific--*vaccinated* people mostly operate unmasked. California simply allowing number vaccinated individuals rise bit more, especially vaccinated kids, opening floodgates, speak. Plus, State already announced would reopening June 15, schools, businesses, etc using target, seem unreasonable keep date drop mask mandate well.

Plenty institutions far conservative reopening plans State. colleges teach still almost entirely remote instruction Fall 2021, full reopening happening next Spring. Suits fine, love working home, know everyone happy arrangement. I'm also employee. also noticed lot people walking around shit-eating grins? bitching can‚Äôt wear mask hours teachers can‚Äôt that, millions do. 

Perhaps quit acting like child people won‚Äôt treat like one go fuck-far get shots (not bad sounds some, still, sheeeit) got second 7th. I'm sort high risk matter strolling street.

Also every one ability get vaccinated weekday. would need wait appointment weekend. would assume weekend slots high demand might need wait couple weeks. CDC going post vaccine data today? Go read r/politics thread CDCs new guidance people literally say want take mask people think they're Republicans. downtrend would say yes. 

Because downtrend involves things:

first dose second dose: means trend stays flatter longer, since people getting second doses weeks first (still contributes number Shots given/appointments)

The downtrend naturally occur become vaccinated, get second doses. 

As anti-Vaxers continue want dose, pool unvaccinated people decreases, downtrend continues. 

Then lottery announcement comes spike, considering thing changed compared natural downtrend, assumed cause spike. it‚Äôs ‚Äòspike‚Äô since bucked downtrend. Parker place? see mistyped car instead card lol No, Patrick great news! family back home many shutdowns, tons family high risk. They‚Äôve finally gotten first shots makes happy. think wait time second four months. doubt that. started people 18 finally get shot. Booking mine  Real hot vax shit Grandma got told wants see grandkids needs vaccine. got 3 days.

I‚Äôd rather prepare cleaned properly wait till certain it‚Äôs still alive surfaces. 

My father suffers lung disease won‚Äôt roll dice. 

Thank reply. appreciate Cartmanland approach. likely never definitively know virus originated due China's unwillingness openly investigate, likely fairly easy reverse engineer COVID19 virus find two original source coronaviruses (if exist) create genomic matching hybrid. so, virus likely man-made. not, virus likely came wild.

Right now, sure looks like there's coverup. OMG even looks like designed Ohio Lottery! That's brilliant! don‚Äôt think understand constitutional rights Vaccines work, especially lowering risk hospitalization/death. 

Looks like CDC knows they're doing!  12+ months masks, I'm surprised there's momentum behind it. people follow sub watch CDC updates closely. know, think anyone would take free guns. Guns cool.

Instead money could make prize one big ass Cummins turbo diesel coal roller 

Hell yeah brother! might absurd thing I've heard week. craziest part never vaccine doesn‚Äôt severely reduce spread, even suggest without evidence concern absolutely bonkers me.  Thanks comment, seen articles discussed elsewhere, part point. 

The resources there, promoted much people would liked. [Compare number articles masks/social distancing]

(Not implying equally effective, proportionally reported)  Maybe I'm biased live border city open border fully vaccinated people, really reason to. assumption makes wrong. It‚Äôs always reaching herd immunity letting kids get mass infected me. seriously understand ""what children immunocompromised"" argument. Parents agency choose &lt;=age 11 children can/can't go immunocompromised perfectly free wear N95 masks socially distance they/their doctors feel safe. gone 0% vulnerable ability protect December 2020 now. lunacy pretend step change magnitude warrants precautions society take past 15 months. live USA? OK quarantine period over.

If so, yes, get vaccinated long either 

18 years older

12-17 years old parental permission (most places vaccinate kids without parental permission, parent present) alternatively, waist time youth working people? One life live partying older experience.

I say fuck that, get live life young full energy. See world hurts much right. sex ton different people, climb mountains, surf oceans, make music whatever beach somewhere...

Then settle quiet life body aches. need much survive obsessed material. ‚ÄúNo medical evidence authority cited claim.‚Äù
Meanwhile Indian variant biggest concern UK India became red zone 17 days neighbouring countries UK.

Funny that. Thats government, always way. Damned damned don‚Äôt. think limiting age group. 18-30, think? try motivate group lowest vax rate. Experiencing thing I'm at. never state mandate area many people masked without protest. would hardly notice stores area dropped mask requirements. think masks become security blanket, even many protested early on. makes people feel like they're something, anything. Yes prediction time. already plenty evidence showing COVID man made. leaked lab due bad protocol still reason punish China. Lab/industrial accidents happen time, it‚Äôs unfortunate strive improve protocol doesn‚Äôt happen again. don‚Äôt hear anyone wanting punish USSR Chernobyl USA three mile. Japan currently dumping contaminated water ocean barely hear news. whole narrative wanting punish China COVID propaganda divert anger, really people asking government isn‚Äôt prepared for/properly handling pandemic. mask announcement everybody know real life talking about. course. Costco past Saturday 90% people already ditched mask (I one them). live state we've roughly 50% people one dose possible vaccinated people represented among Costco shoppers, doubt it. Live? Sure. Continue follow guidelines rest country isn‚Äôt? Doubtful. at. oldest 12 month he‚Äôll get vaccine. adults interact regularly vaccinated. feel like risk younger 2 getting severe case minimal going stress more. We‚Äôll continue stay away crowded indoor places vaccinated otherwise going let live lives. daughter kindergarten school year full time without masks (required higher grades younger ones) hasn‚Äôt single issue. Good news much easier find n95s now. immunocompromised position I'd mask best mask could find cases drop low risk level, that's me. probably reduced 10 days BioNTech/Pfizer deliveries double week 31 May onwards (as noted someone else below).   guarantee would work well every state. lot people incentivized prospect possibly winning $1 million convictions truly getting vaccine. think lot positives vaccine I‚Äôm fan attitude assume best case scenario throw away caution. 

I wouldn‚Äôt stress it, people yelled masks didn‚Äôt anything back March 2020. really weren‚Äôt critically thinking it, parroting headline. point people WANT believe go back normal, maybe work science isn‚Äôt say conclusively point.

Doesn‚Äôt hurt wait bit see shakes out. explain. best bet N95 grade better meantime, looking alternative employment environment. spoken manager situation all? dont know ask this. father got covid, 2 weeks quarantine. Quarantine ended, wanna get vaccine now. Problem cos dot know wait more, get vaccine now. symptoms, nothing wrong me, 100 % healthy reach herd immunity least. way determining exact percentage is. though vaccinated people headed back normal life Okay. Maybe wake call. good reminder can‚Äôt let guard second covid zero strategy. Fall winter too, I'm excited. Miss going movies Belgiums limited AZ 41+, limits J&amp;J (but hardly get J&amp;J) Why? kids currently get flu shot.

They cannot get vaccinated Covid. Meanwhile Newsom dragging feet best case rates country. (mostly) calculated expected value properly frame such. checking weather facebook?? know actual weather sites visit. might ignorant question, could antibody test give clue level protection? across Ohio, people underestimated chance getting COVID overestimating chance winning lottery.   That's cool. I'm not. I'll probably wear one whenever get sick get groceries mask-forever sentiment birds. cautious could last year. I'm month removed second shot friends family least one. Anyone that's willfully unvaxxed kiss ass. main reasoning see used vaccinated people still mask up. feel like wear mask everywhere go serve moral example likely following rules begin with, heavily shamed it. I've already stopped wearing mask places requiring feel zero guilt it. part wore mask vaccine available got vaccinated one was. even still wore mask vaccines became available every adult state. available everywhere state.  Yes. free fire denying information. Nope. I‚Äôve tried last year diligent mask-wearing, tiny nasal passages, every mask makes breathing tougher. happy needed still wear places it‚Äôs required, glad able leave places. weird circle, unscientific results Pfizer caused side effects, J&amp;J caused mild side effects basically everyone know took it, Moderna random. know one person took Moderna stay home next day instead going work think one J&amp;J takers well. admins notified? finding lol..? support government overreach, got it. HK using saliva-based tests since last year. I've already seen people swore getting vaccine already get moment became eligible. know work 6 months think long enough know lasts longer. take vaccine? beginning say ""a bit petrified shots despite managed"" suggests took vaccine all. However, latter part message contemplate taking shot wearing mask. someone mentions DNA regards vaccine, know they‚Äôre moron. honor system create environment hurt significant portion population. might spread it, great, business enforcing masking help spread people don‚Äôt option get vaccine. change. Eventually it'll normal one remember first. It‚Äôs always months away lot. unless medical reason get one, yes. vaccines protect society, even care yourself, care others. keep writing articles nothing change. Businesses, schools etc chose install air filtration systems would help protect employees, customers, anyone stuck enclosed public spaces great lengths time. CDC shouldn‚Äôt playing politics I've also seen said, source claim tend stick CDC said. 

It's annoying goalposts shifted last year necessary. goalposts arbitrarily shifting ""we need prevent hospitals overwhelmed"" ""any sort loss life COVID unacceptable"", various stops between. I've lockdowns mandates last year, hate goalposts shifting point justify continuing measures they're needed initial goals were.

It seems like working backwards me, know conclusion want come justifications it. FREEDOM Wear high quality mask studies provide answers; avoid risky environments things flare up. I‚Äôm one 4%. saying don‚Äôt matter? know he‚Äôs getting media attention, gets nowhere near level of, say, Fauci. Given correct been, think getting talked much Fauci. Currently 37.7% US population fully vaccinated.

Once people already pipeline get second dose, maybe we'll end close 45-50% population vaxxed. Estimates need 70-85% vax rate herd immunity. get even close.

The anti-vaxxers wear masks protect anyone else. ain't long shot.  Sure, force simply things like outside, shopping, etc.

But want place work school you‚Äôre forced surrounded bunch people, could see people charge would want everything could keep everyone protected possible. number senators.

Well, house already supposed represent population. senate based population, another house representatives Someone first. helping normalize good thing. I'm same, keeping mask pocket case staff somewhere asks put one on. cannot see nephew, family members state, turn big collab social media influencer, potentially loosing hundreds dollars, I've applied countless jobs, never followed up, going medical issues, still wear mask hope keep rule place despite hurting chances life jobs. Why? don't, new normal wlll reverted pandemic normal. **I'd rather wait months now, return fake normal stripped away, damaging many other's mental health. SEE POINT**

**How good people go back normality, landing good person job, wave cases come back, business lay everyone off, stuck back home without job? many doctors, forced covid ridden ICUs? That's FAIR.** BMJ article telling even two weeks SECOND dose, CoronaVac's efficacy still 27.7%. rises 56.6% two weeks (four weeks second dose).

No matter what, vaccine definitely slow burn, could absolutely see giving people false sense confidence. going patience wait almost two months reach mediocre level efficacy could reached week Pfizer? Discuss concerns doctors take precautions every flu season current pandemic. way vaccinations, matter much lock stop cases always pop back start process again. 


It's honestly absolutely insane Australia's government thinks everyone vaccinated middle 2022 borders open reasonable. 

I wish countries would realize us reason travel besides tourism, fianc√© lives another 0 covid country (Vietnam) able see year half, honestly doubt I'll get time 2021 either border closures. I'd pay anything could, quarantine month, I'm fully vaccinated see again. UK data suggest AZ blood clot issue dramatically less likely occur second dose, show first. standpoint, data supports gvimg everybody first dose AZ second dose. cautious first doses AZ, particularly younger age groups risk vs. benefit bit murky. catch covid (hope dont!), monoclonal antibody treatments prevent severe disease hospitalization. Plus, they're provided free although health care facility administering might charge (insurance cover that). 

Just make sure ask it, doctor. wanted reply back faced fear got shot morning. Yes cried. uses roman numerals say ten years days??!  mother chance vulnerable easily influenced woman lol. not, there's probably chance bet would work lot better lot people chance win $100-500  Yeah. know I'm old man yelling cloud point, get proliferation term. add ""kind of"" make even noncommittal. becoming extraneous word people throw everything making lose meaning becoming word people say try sound cool. point guess upvotes. pretty sure would work, point laughing ass telling people internet, would secretly kind support it? I'm sure sort ideas map well country single payer health care system.

In short, cannot guarantee actions cause undue suffering others nature pandemic. virtually impossible prevent widespread death disease, healthcare structure system whereby care easily denied people misfortune catching disease. change came reporting? changed methodology quite drastically right?  large number Pfizer vials ***discarded*** 5 days old used point want accelerate

&amp;#x200B;

the UK using 12 week dosing interval since beginning

&amp;#x200B;

Delaying COVID vaccine‚Äôs second dose boosts immune response   Also CDC doesn‚Äôt actually set official policy, told us truth it‚Äôs safe go maskless vaccinated. mad, mad local officials. Exactly America. worst second dose either times COVID matters, forced take it, that's lawsuit waiting happen cared suffer ill effects, lost money due missing work, etc. 'Murica.ha Get first one can. unvaccinated people, presumably, ok risk chosen vaccinated despite available possible adults. know months vaccine distribution?

Obviously excludes people want vaccine can‚Äôt get due immune compromised, maybe people get n-95s stay home. Also excludes children 12, statistically low risk virus anyway, parent scared, keep kid home.  Teenagers eligible vaccination area. expect teens interested vaccination fully vaccinated around 6 weeks. Weeks that, partial protection. still recommended mask, happily mask indoor areas crowded outdoor areas foreseeable future, teens reduced risk June.

Of course, still concern young children immunocompromised, note. hope case, getting Moderna 2nd shot (Astra 1st) hope left alone whole covid situation Immunocompromised people always take precautions. diseases exist. me. Confirming AGAIN. leethehobit rich. decided follow technical definition waiting put flair here.

But reality, worrying mask last week, except required. annoying, country slow fault EU even tho America refused export vaccines EU exported lot. Underpromise overdeliver skimmed study UK 12 week gap first second doses. Key takeaway Combined effect symptomatic disease, single dose either vaccine 80% effective preventing admission hospital covid-19 single dose BNT162b2 85% effective preventing death covid-19.

(BNT162b2is Pfizer)

A first dose Pfizer 85% efective preventing death COVID. Astra zeneca similar.

That good effectiveness single dose, think Canada happy current strategy getting many people first doses possible. 

If 20 people would getting COVID dieing, gave 10 first second doses, 10 nothing, expect 10 deaths. instead gave 20 first doses, expect 3 Yes basically case faulty PPE point. Employers allowed require PPE wish responsible safety issues arising PPE. Health services continued function Sweden, Korea, Japan Taiwan too. got keep rights. false equivalence. isn‚Äôt masks - it‚Äôs people working home, businesses reduced capacity, school closures, people socializing less general, people cancelling anything sniffle. Wear mask want miss interacting people actually seeing faces. think middle ground CDC completely missed. See top comment here, stores offering masked hours keeping essential stores masked still allowing vaccinated adults go social lives normally would great recommendation opinion. say state/local population reaches X% vaccination even away protocols.  fair needle tiny (typically) feel tiniest pinch half second don‚Äôt feel needle actually inside you.

That's said. remember April 2020 Norwegian government threatening send police small towns remove city dwellers cabins retreated to. weren‚Äôt fooling around respect preventing spread small communities. so? Remember fully vaccinated people count mask forever folks. 4 weeks count.

/s friends told ‚Äúoh got vax Ed government site I‚Äôm probably still list‚Äù fact thought process leaned way instead schools lying (which currently couple states right laws) shows far gone. second dose CoronaVac vital

Either second dose vital, first dose takes several weeks become effective. I'd interested see efficacy several weeks first dose without second.

But either way, unfortunately matter Chile. worried it‚Äôd mess menstrual cycle well? üòÜ 

Sadly, though, somewhere bowels Facebook there‚Äôs probably females refuse vaccinate read increases risk prostate testicular cancer... blame you.

You ask doctor antibody test. Someone know (also two) tested really strong antibodies. sure well vaccine would take, apparently did. woman giving shots (both times) blocked view injection site, assume policy designed keep needle-phobic panicking. mildly disappointing (I wanted see happen!), get it, also, hardly even realized happening.

If pain arm hours later tiny drop blood bandage, might known I'd even gotten shot. Thanks lot. live privileged urban bubble work home blessing, rest India turmoil put simply. moment 18 45s vaccinated due acute shortage central (federal) government refused procure basis one nation, one vaccination. states competing procure overseas. Idk ends.  no, not. trial getting bigger.

&amp;#x200B;

**'Mix match' UK Covid vaccine trial reason trial getting bigger mixed vaccines demonstrated **MORE** effective.

&amp;#x200B;

you training immune system.

&amp;#x200B;

introducing one method ""attack"" 

multiple methods ""attack""

&amp;#x200B;

which offers better training? sure effectiveness year damn masks sure helped us get flu. possible, feels like mono I've already able get again. People dumb enough avoid vaccine also dumb enough get drawn lotteries Mask mandate going away necessarily mean masks went away. state never mask mandate, almost every store business required 99% people saw indoors masked. last weekend, everyone still masked.

So need know things change *when people actually take masks off* /=/ mask mandate goes away. needle aspect mom telling me. health concerns antivax nonsense. shots gotten life, one refuses get... planned got go ahead owner told specifically writing remodel would pocket would claim reimbursement work done.

Which giant red flag tell after. NFL require vaccines attend games raffle box seats people vaccinated, they'd get LOT vaccine hesitant. remember catch (hopefully not), monoclonal antibody treatment free via government though hospital may charge administer it. ask doctor, many people even know it.  question: I‚Äôm States overseas while. really want Moderna vaccine it‚Äôs country moment. There‚Äôs chance get Sinovac vaccine beginning next week. could get Moderna return States next March? silly idea happy Sinovac? Pfizer effective SA Variant AZ dose already received, getting Pfizer(BioNTech people north america guess) mean would better coverage, 5G? :) looked? honest, least yourself.

Here‚Äôs one top results quick web search for: cdc vaccines work includes links several studies. Yeah SE Denver proper. Kind hilarious think? lottery ticket hundreds millions $2, even odds favor, grand scheme things chance million basically selling $100 less equivalent. Can‚Äôt wait vaccine cocktail also never experienced life without high speed internet

Well, yeah. Everybody free 5g microchips now.   People bad logical reasoning bad math. knew? really feel guys. Hang hopefully get enough vaccines go around. love crowds, hate people. Hospitals sub agree version history can't even procure new graphics card. understand people think vaccines come from, *the vaccine fairy*. ‚òùÔ∏è guy OCDs.  come Nicholas Wade‚Äôs covid origin story censored sub? think person replying meant ""shot"" bullets, needles.  true. Fully vaccinated people already died Covid US. It‚Äôs tiny number Interesting, would good example selective pressure could cause variants become less deadly I‚Äôm saying OP wrong, I‚Äôd like see statistical analysis lead 97% number. we‚Äôre talking vaccine efficacy numbers, 97% twice good 94%. It‚Äôs big claim. guarantee you, US government would erase student loans everyone gets vaccinated, young people's vaccine turnout would EXPLODE.  CA like MA‚Äôs evil twin. political tendencies, one implements well other... well let‚Äôs say isn‚Äôt one whose population declined last 10 years That's wanted see thresholds. population X% vaccinated, go ahead open eff up. 

Or perhaps, children vaccinated, keep indoor masking essential locations require masks non-essential locations vaccinated adults mostly get back normal!

He regular pandemic CBS's Face Nation, one longest running news programs history. Granted, he's making TikTok videos, shows like Face Nation important older demographics.  enough kids higher risk conditions mask MONTHS get vaccinated. completely factual. get headache antibodies get rid spread either. reason getting vaccines otherwise what's point? think PA might reach goal 70% adults fully vaccinated June ends. We're currently 67.7% one dose, increasing .2 .4 percentage points day (most commonly .3). Unless there's sudden wall, get 70% first dose Memorial Day four weeks, give take, they're fully vaccinated. think view sane totally reasonable parent - encourage everyone believe best according recommendations. means masking sake kids, thats fine, means dumping mask due vaccinated, thats fine too. 

Personal choice freedoms name game. mask causing air flow restriction breathing issues, bad mask. Right you. trust change. Again‚Ä¶ cares?
If fully vaxxed risk disease, around non vaxxed not, damn minuscule it‚Äôs even worth thinking about. Incidentally great way Delta get trouble EEOC. EEOC published pretty positive guidance employers mandating vaccines (with caveats) big remains differential treatment employees. 

Either bonafide occupational requirement vaccinated not; applying new hires creating differential requirement. 

Delta still get away it, generous religious exemptions (which abused) exceptions want maintain different standard new hires existing employees. likely would never even know infected. matter, there‚Äôs decent chance they‚Äôve already never knew. probably mentioned... can't find quick scroll. 

I several co-workers located Canada. first dose. None second dose. 2+ months, 3 months, scheduled doses. 

One got hit first dose, second dose tentatively scheduled mid August. 

Canada rolling dice opting vaccinate everyone one dose ASAP pushing second doses months past 'recommended' gap periods achieve goal. 

Do people, percentage, seem want vaccine Canada compared US? Yes. fantastic news. also going fully vaccinated quite time. Depending gamble pays off, may technically fully vaccinated first push period booster proves less effective due time gap.

IMO - 'win' public perception side. stops (for now). Whether win terms vaccination effectiveness TBD. Big gamble we'll wait see whether pays off. feel like lifting mask mandate attempt CDC vax rates, rates CDCs stance change mandate masks... anyone remember CDC said wear masks know effective (they are) think us population smart enough use effectively (this still debate population).

""you know long term effects are!"" üôÑ  BlueAnon twist statistic around say 'over 3/4ths young people said would return work school even vaccine mandatory'... sound like much demand. default comparing countries (especially countries 10x difference populations) pretty much ALWAYS per capita. would never use absolute numbers that, effectively meaningless... None matters. don‚Äôt need know that. there‚Äôs chance India went many months low activity, randomly took fire ever since. unlikely states see anything like again, surprised see surges states stay 50% vaccinated. anyone's guess right now, Michigan shown us even 35-40% vaccinated high enough prevent good size spike. No, wake call nation decided go covid zero strategy. 

You‚Äôd better plan staying locked away world get fully vaccinated. agree!  That's works China stupid low vaccination rate?
14million day ain't low it?  People still going wearing masks, whether there's requirement not.  interesting me. way talk disease itself, they're constantly minimizing effects. ""Why would take steps prevent getting disease mortality rate 0.000000000000001%,"" they'll ask, adding zeroes since last time posed question? yet purported reactions experienced minuscule fraction amount population actually died it? may well 50/50 odds eyes. Forcing people wear limiting indoor capacity is. 

If want wear them, go ahead. could care less wearing one point. 

I'm mad along Phil Murphy hides behind facade following science, that's apparently agrees science. Apparently, wants watch businesses shore struggle close another summer, time make money. point, he's power tripping. start 180'ing along lost me.

He's joke. Sure, ignore data clearly shows downtrends positive cases, hospitalizations, deaths since rollout vaccine. past six weeks, state, seen 65% decrease stats mentioned above. Get conspiracy bull. much longer really believe entire small town majority people wearing masks? 1 month? 2 months? I‚Äôd bet people slowly start going maskless first dose shots. Last week day rolling avg 22,333. 21,323 yesterday.

Is right? assume cannot correct. bias, really USA country Canada really compare see we're (either good bad perspective). share lot culture, large landmass, etc. Canada much closer culturally etc USA country Europe rest world.

The good comparison point Canadians use brothers Australia (which also compare sometimes, much they're close). said back, maybe here, maybe elsewhere, forget, giving people money get could possible incentive. mean like ""free"" money? Exactly this. People worried ""how know they're really vaccinated?"" gives shit. part, others people want theirs, that's prerogative choice. change minds. also force get it. People play lottery play dream Florida, way months. never sat right people left-leaning went moral tirades people follow lockdown rules T. even went far say people required sign waiver denying treatment COVID got it. thought healthcare right? 

You're right. never safe feeling superior. Follow science. No, science. Yeah, you‚Äôre old now. Hitting 20-23 year olds starting get weird. 30 year olds looking right.

Get life Jr Boomer here. live purple area saw one person without mask store last April last week. CDCs announcement I've seen several. knows they're vaxxed not. thing feeling sick vaccine know end soon it‚Äôs dangerous. People covid feel sick weeks never really know one takes turn worse. initial target September, based scheduled deliveries. remember even America's target beginning July. Pfizer overachieved advanced dates.

Problem people absolutely refused believe dates could advanced. every reddit post America's vaccination, would comment saying ""meanwhile Canada"". I‚Äôm agreeing you, it‚Äôs dangerous children. People tell trust doctors say something don‚Äôt like never enforced it, even employees, never requirement.

It theatre. HIV prevention: Condom Prep

Covid prevention: Vaccines, masks, lockdowns, distancing, test trace. Still dont quite understand countries introduced curfews (lack compliance?) HUGE difference something airborne Idiot#1 infect many. HIV personal responsibillity makes safe, Corona dependent community compliance.

If dont agree preventions basically letting run unchecked, ofcause discussed be. Funny compare China actually got control 4 months time local measures place popped again. arguably much better less restrictive responce restrictions lasting 8 months less europes...

But yes, HIV still greater tragidy Covid is.   Shush tell people read fine print better odds helps put risks perspective too. 

Like, rate blood clots ballpark per million so. 

If equivalent chance winning $1 million getting blood clots, probably makes balance risks seems little manageable. check site daily well datastudio sciensano: Everyone get vaccine, nobody forced get one. actually think that. vast majority people want get vaccine butthurt Trump lost current administration getting well deserved credit shitting itself. literally ""get sick libz"" like past year. all. invent stuff LOL

look : fully vaccinated care wear mask not. makes difference me

and unvaccinated must wear mask, wash hands, safe distance. ... Hate break there‚Äôs lot pathogens COVID could worried well haven‚Äôt they‚Äôve never made big deal COVID. ‚ÄúI refuse get FB research clearly shows vaccines full toxins would never get let childr‚Äîmoney?!?! OK!‚Äù 30s even worse. 43 here, disbelief fast 30s went, realized almost halfway 40s... Hahaha, imbicels... One 10 chance serious medical implications covid? course get vaccinated!

One million chance get money? Yaaas! this! Even though restrictions protected lives ensuring health service could still function?

How valid use emergency powers? [Laughs effective makes sense everyone 70% fully vaccinated brutally honest big issue Japanese government know actually vaccinated citizens tens millions vaccines sitting warehouses country doesn‚Äôt matter doesn‚Äôt mean unvaccinated don‚Äôt wear mask? Yeah it‚Äôs disheartening. I‚Äôm frustrated hate masks originally went lockdown protect elderly immunocompromised. seems like people reached limit fucks give. I‚Äôll protect now. Piglet start  remodel house renting someone else.  

LOL WHUTT!!! unvaccinated must wear mask, wash hands, safe distance

the fully vaccinated care (I care wear mask not)

see? simple  Yeah, seems like it. general attitude pretty shitty. understand people wanting get back normalcy (I want too). shitting anyone raised legit concerns crumby. mean statistically speaking, 0.000001% people vaccinated could still die. non-zero amount people (which okay). They've brigading throwing shit bad parent choosing take kids public going unmasked people.

A bunch selfish rejects also believe asymptomatic, contagious. attitude right never know full extent covid's devastation India Yep, I‚Äôm one them. go peoples houses living luckily access hospital grade KN95s seem like I‚Äôm going cut extracurricular activities online shopping. Yeah bit weird.

There various possible scenario's think of.

1 village minks bred quite small virus ran hosts spread due dumb luck. (or spread slowly village village undetected lock stopped spread)

2 virus less infectious early stages got critical mutation enabled accelerated human human transmission near Wuhan.

3 virus made first jump mink human Wuhan.

4 mink Yunnan theory wrong. don‚Äôt mean private setting mean public spaces really bearing. Legal doctrine says unless forced state without consent they‚Äôre responsible actions it. That's somewhat odd would imagine Pakistan would jump chance blame covid woes India I'll probably wear masks somewhat regularly 2-3 months year get bad wildfire smoke CDC always plays extra-cautious. Unless particularly vulnerable worried, follow Pfizer's schedule without issue. Remember March 29 -- less two months ago!! -- CDC Director Rochelle Walensky ""issued stark emotional warning ""impending doom"" infections, hospitalization deaths rise""? 

Thankfully, turn way. work advertising imo *far* incentive advertisement. Wait till hit 31. hit I'm closer 40 21... read 400.000 group already invited vaccination due age, severe risk health care profession. people already invited 75% already planned vaccination. bad two weeks! matter : look fully vaccinated care wear mask not. unvaccinated must wear mask like before

game over.

and vaccinated means less chances meet spreader Hand washing never bad advice. Yes 4/27 show.heres run down, clip (the original link really long idk starts easier me) sad lot world can't get vaccine even willing pay it, fuckin Ohio bribe people lottery get it.  say anything idiot lol I'm anxious hell wear mask agree. rushed. even majority vaccinated yet. weird question, Pfizer vaccine trials seems defined full immunity 7 days 2nd dose. true, CDC make us wait 14? actually technically fully vaxxed 7 days 2nd dose? Buddy, barely midst second wave. mention drunk people actually full control person like someone choosing get vaccinated does. think correct 50% adult US population one dose. However throw children (a lot eligible) it‚Äôs less 50% total population basis.  Since split hospital bills vaccinating many possible reducing amount total hospital visits makes financial sense everyone. find hilarious getting downvoted. right. average persons understanding probability/risk batshit insane. take solace likelihood people buy lottery tickets (aka [stupid ‚Äúthere‚Äôs chance‚Äù people downvoting you. Idk happened Taiwan cost fucked up. excuses gave nonsense me. Test don‚Äôt need done medical professional, worry test center become spread event, probably worry positive cases wandering around cannot test out. messaged PCP doctor order due recommended reason. going ask GI doctor perhaps. yet House pretty much doesn‚Äôt matter without fair representation Senate, we‚Äôve seen decade now. Thank :) Pretty absurd hyperbolic comparison you‚Äôve got there.. It‚Äôs like walk grocery store forgot mask offer free one. 

Either way though, absurd scenario mine involve generosity, it‚Äôs semantic issue generous means showing readiness give something strictly necessary expected. 

Again‚Äîsharing vaccines altruistic, generous. one obligated share communities, expected to, fits literal description ‚Äúgenerosity‚Äù. Indian Government really trying alter reality claim ‚ÄúSingapore‚Äù variant blame? Lol really scary part lieu new CDC guidelines, fear WEARING mask makes look Republican anti-vaxx. I'm boat still wearing, generally. think kids least 12 years old age deserve autonomy comes vaccinations. Chipotle lifted mask mandate vaccinated [We continue require employees wear masks; however, fully-vaccinated guests need wear mask inside Chipotle restaurants, except required local  Good distinction Sinovac less effective vaccines available USA. Lmao uhh no. likely zero chance ""lab leak"" watch much Netflix.

Why people ignore Occam's Razor? Ebola come lab leak would regular joe schmoe coronavirus need to? 

The problem deforestation. Encroach wildlife, get exposed viruses. One mutation jump humans. Always good keep mask on. Vaccinated people still get covid infect others. One *potential* reason much population vaccinated Sinovac shown significantly reduced efficacy relative many vaccines [at least one (as low 3% first shot 57% two weeks second). expect, CDC talking about. bungled masks beginning, based ""Science"", totally conserving supply preventing panic. right punish ppl right thing. science long full potential protection (95% IIRC) 2nd Pfizer? 5 weeks in-between 1st 2nd dose that's relevant. ask dealing pretty rough OCD made life pandemic kinda hellish. Like, even going outside take trash, months.

I got second Pfizer dose last Wednesday today went individual apartment viewing, stayed double masked FFP2 OP mask whole time. whole thing got nervous especially saw people building wearing masks. I'm country people vaccinated yet.

I reading 1 week 2nd Pfizer usually 95% even already pretty high 21 days 1st dose. hard parse many different studies find information correct since seem different answers floating around. That's good, hope remains perception. saw post recently Republicans total flip-flop saying maybe start wearing masks now‚Äî!?

Still, realistically, wearing mask hard before, hard now.  Calling bullshit, especially TX numbers. Yeah, also would like know someone knows whats going on, dont wanna say Sinovac suprises 40% Chile fully vaccinated still high number cases deaths Literally every state needs this. 


The fact stealing idea baffling me. agreed. 

i got vaccination, wore masks, stayed home. fair ones right thing. can't win play. side effects, people side effects. side effects remain same, occur often. NJ densely populated state country. One first hit areas hardest hit areas country. course hes going cautious. smart move. Lets done right end instead prematurely celebrating.

Throwing on/taking mask takes seconds.

The people upset mostly people baby raged masks year straight. lot pretend got vaccinated even didnt thats whats slowing things down.

The CDC used statements thinking itd dangling carrot give people incentive get vaccinated. pretty gullible know theres chunk population pretend vaccinated arent. lot medical experts puzzled CDC announcing this. timing poor. lot states opened vaccines everyone month ago. could week 1 still waiting second shot. Plus teens, childret, pregnant women, people certain health conditions cant get vaccinated yet. Theres still large number people arent vaxxed. people get vaxxed soon, could risk antivax weirdos breathing pandemic everywhere. Yes risk people wear mask, mask isnt 100% protection. Others around wearing masks veing vaxxed mitigate risk more.

Dont tell ""kids dont die covid cares"" long term health issues thing covid.

Since theres easy way tell vaccinated fact theres percentage people lie means lets protect vulnerable give bit time get vaccinated. Lets get closer herd immunity.

You want mad someone? Go get mad anti vaxxer weirdos. want things normal? Start getting case people fence convince go get vaccinated.

Not even half country fully vaxxed... like people trying fuck blows mind.

Oh, CDC way things entire pandemic.

This pandemic really showed selfish uncaring people are. Truly digusting. minor inconvenience takes literally seconds save lives.

Hopefully history remembers us wore masks got vaccinated, protect ourselves, protect vulnerable. hope right. Ohio 42% first doses right know lot south worse that. Technically quarantine period per CDC two weeks last day dad's isolation. live person considered new close contact every day infected person done isolating, start last exposure. both. Many countries' governments vaccine hesitant new vaccines covid problem among population.

From I've witnessed pandemic, every country gets turn. Even started ad darlings. virus. way end without vaccination. think bunch smaller ones would better, focusing areas low vaccination rates. Also give away cash, sports tickets- whatever takes.

I think free concert series. Get card get shot. bet would get lot younger people.

they shot setup red rocks concert last Saturday think vaccinated 100 so. is, think responsibility vaccinated people police unvaccinated people, kids must matter me.

Thanks proving point made initial post.  expected, guess American Way. truly thought would slow trickle, masks would linger way beyond broad spectrum usefulness.

Just goes show can't predict anything. Good news overall. States need implement incentives get vaccinated like Ohio doing. higher vaccination rate faster Covid infections plummet. least area, people wearing masks ones extra cautious. ones won‚Äôt get vaccinated weren‚Äôt wearing mask begin Nature‚Äôs way removing gene üß¨ pool. Don‚Äôt mask up, possibly die young. Yeah segment pushed aside. parent immunocompromised kid tough see everyone going back to""normal"" political statements, turn one.

Where been? Republicans already that. That's problem. said: still wear mine. could definitely see certain social stigma wearing mask people believe unvaccinated, however. studied extensively, worry it. There's nothing would make less safe storing like that. worry effectiveness mrna delicate that's studied. stupidest thing I've ever read. mention complete waste taxpayer money. country getting corrupt speak. must looking see huge spike March (like every state) decline afterward.

What‚Äôs different past month, Florida‚Äôs daily death rates rising much they‚Äôve falling. isn‚Äôt happening states high numbers; they‚Äôre dropping pretty steadily.

At rate, within week we‚Äôre going see days fewer people die California Florida. That‚Äôs really hard explain. last poll saw indicated 90% adult Quebecers want get vaccinated Except Anti Vaxxers Covid-deniers free go maskless now. really care anymore since I‚Äôm fully vaccinated. risk getting sick them.  flights, regardless covid? feel self conscious kid cries plane would amazing! Ah yes think right esp box. surprised see surges states stay 50% vaccinated.

No state stay level Yep, thing last Friday Costco Trader Joe‚Äôs lifted mask mandate. went stores one couple didn‚Äôt mask.

My gym hand maskless probably month state lifted mandate. stopped wearing mine weeks ago hit 2 weeks post vax new CDC Guidelines, agree. Now, however, CDC saying vaccinated need wear mask‚Äîthen perception wearing mask, must vaccinated. 

I'm exaggerating concern bit conversation; still wear mask. says ambassador idiocy..... TIL Canada actually lot fewer stupid people. Cities issue.   We're never getting 70%. 45% republican morons refusing get vaccinated.

It's time let get immunity old fashioned way. works vaccinated realistically accelerates timeline make things safer immunocompromised others legitimately can't get vaccinated. Waiting idiots right thing futile. 50% people, 50% adults? sure reside, adult numbers much higher, assume that's people inside Costco. think bunch smaller ones would better, focusing areas low vaccination rates. Also give away cash, sports tickets- whatever takes.

The entire Indian situation wakeup call everyone. Despite US losing 500,000 people could much worse.  Huh, maybe issue airways, like deviated septum? Open borders already! really slow start, even government told us things would ramp like Q2, people still stuck Q1 slow mentality Herd immunity. Neigh LOL added 20 seconds soap No, like anyone immunocompromised happened: manage health. world/other people going you.

I get frustrating, realistically expect happen? accommodations long? Dumb people 101 According Reddit, America country planet. countries exist. Redditors see comment saying get rid masks yet, mass downvote without thinking. probably people working home set computers, department disable edge install chrome them. aka Wawa allows customers shop without mask regardless vaccination status. may enforced corporate stand point, still complied locally never saw unmasked people walking around agree. state tried super careful gave caused concentration populations leaving huge gaps. better spread like web get vulnerable vaccinated. assume trying simplify messaging. yeah, considered fully vaxxed one week second Pfizer vaccine.   funny vaccinated looks beautiful. Im gonna leave like LOL Questioning education futile. evidence based variables outcomes. must ""uneducated."" guess got college graduate school 3.9 gpa based good looks alone. short run, vaccinated population going result faster economic opening.

My mother vaccinated, still hesitant things used do. got similar story many parents unvaccinated children. population heavily vaccinated, fears would assuaged.  Wooh proof lift mandates becomes much harder govt manipulate data. *collective groaning*

Seriously though, technology awesome hope learn tons it. sad many places, lot people would PAY $1 million get vaccine. thinking. mandates lifted, ONE wear mask, even unvaccinated. Nobody wants anymore. Set appointment tell he's going go he's will. source always late, least country couple days behind official reports.

On top that, seems least seasonality Covid meant likely see cases deaths fall time year even without vaccines much like last year Sure benefits, would trade health twice year packed bars, concerts, sporting events day depends. states (for example Virginia), state attorney general come said opinion, law allows universities legally require vaccination, even though still fully FDA approved.

I never mentioned CDC. Throughout pandemic, rise fall deaths mirrored rise fall cases, lag 3 weeks (though mass vaccination elderly, seen lagged CFR fall). Cases 50% spring peak mid April, see deaths drop similarly. already seeing drop! 2nd week June neighborhood 350 deaths/day. sit chair second. People seem understand this. people LIKELY ALREADY COVID. practicing proper mask wearing (if wearing all), social distancing apart large gatherings almost entire pandemic.

What we're seeing vaccines work stupidity people getting covid basically pushing us toward herd immunity.

Why people reddit assume millions unmasked unvaccinated people caught covid already beyond me. agree theory frankly confidence vampires, literal pedos, doofuses would appointed empowered practice. countries done best less marginalized power players global community (Cuba, several African nations, though Vietnam large big economy doubt west would follow lead unfo). hegemonic countries fucked key part parts stopping this, whether Chinas early secrecy, foot dragging west beginning, repeated mismanagement putting profits public health almost every step way similar, took temp realized fever (only 101 degrees, big baby lol felt worse). also headache threw up, day spent bundled bed fine though. federal government never mandates.

He‚Äôs actually correct, specifically ask patients getting vaccine antibody treatments last 90 days. would receive you‚Äôve severe case covid admitted hospital. paid dates ‚Äúsugar daddy‚Äù clients stripped online Fans past year

I'm really feeling bad someone readily admits ignored gathering distancing rules past year üôÑ Look whole picture Seychelles. using mostly Chinese made vaccine although cases high open borders international travelers yes case counts high deaths serious illness not. wipe brown stain nose. Several countries total numbers close bad US. also countries worse per capita infection rates. Easy killer, downvote you. legitimately asking, I've never heard something like non-vaxxed enough data yet make determination. Early data suggest medications worse others vaccine effectiveness. Crohn's Disease also go top research institution IBD. may right. case fully understand. Otherwise point stands. Nahhhh That‚Äôs reassuring. CDC tell Johnson Johnson case GBS. MRNA seems way go get it. pretty smart people want vaccine, also probably people super Lottery. Yeah, going always crazy people group. preach One month ago (in United States) talking brother Canada government negotiate enough vaccines vaccination lagging. Canada %age population vaccinated US, sign slump like have.

Its amazing country low vaccine hesitancy short period time finally get it. current gov try alter every reality *can't* vaccinated still wanna *die* jackass lied vaccinated wearing mask whilst spreading disease everywhere around them? *want* vaccinate, able yet? wearing mask effective (as established earlier pandemic), *all* people forced wear mask *prove* vaccinated.

If want ""disclose medical information target"" fucking wear mask. Well, aren‚Äôt wrong. either summer pandemic done least first world countries, anti vaxxers anti maskers win fucked longer? Minute Maid park, went Royal Rumble January 2020 caught COVID. concourse area travel get seats tight thousands people literally like sardines. new Rangers stadium, anything like old one, wide open conncourses open air. definitely feel like outdoors entire time, would hesitant go Minute Maid even roof open concourse right now, would worried old rangers stadium reason. pcp neurologist said no? doctors could discuss with?  think misunderstanding them. They're saying students wanted wait finals side effects cause miss exams. example, side effects included: nausea, vomiting, fever, horrible back pain, fatigue, chills, aches/pains. literally get bed 24 hours feel great even that. still student absolutely want get dose exams at. first covid idiot would put mask care risk others, long likely safe. 

The new covid ""idiot"" take mask because, even though they're likely safe personally, want take extra step protect others (it's 100% can't infect others) continue foster environment protecting others supported, vaccines widespread. Remember, 50 million people still eligible, another 17 million became eligible last week, neither groups likely get sick, certainly pass legitimately unable take vaccine various reasons. Wearing mask longer small price pay we've minimized risk risk.

But yeah, really nice equivalence part. It‚Äôs almost like people use different masks too. blame game wheel keeps spinning lol. Interesting BBC saying actually it‚Äôs 36. 30 garden 6 six indoors time possible long don‚Äôt mix. Also choosing believe dumbest sh!t. year echochambering source downplaying seriousness Covid echochambering source amplifying anything negative vaccine. 

In network family belongs week 3 separate families rural different parts state PA got Covid. 2 couples feeling quite sick. availability could vaccinated now. Yeah that‚Äôs CDC told me. wish data autoimmune patients handled it. Almost surprising mentioned sub got trouble, appears name-calling. I‚Äôve heard lot stories also haven‚Äôt able verify them. Breakthrough cases expected though; remember, testing effective severe symptoms death. numbers still amazingly good. I‚Äôve recently developed GAD past year, anxiety really weird lot time, don‚Äôt even realize it. brain really good rationalizing things, you‚Äôre feeling overly anxious blame upcoming deadline rather chemical imbalance brain. Additionally, medical anxiety extremely common, know someone quite liberal due debilitating medical anxiety refuses get vaccine. Sounds kind similar family members Allergies vaccine components one reason why. received vaccine different disease last couple weeks short-term reason delay vaccination (at least April received second dose). Another 12 years old. many reasons, exist begrudge anyone unvaccinated advice doctor. post story time anecdote, unfortunate, still extreme outlier. Everyone knows breakthrough cases occur, they‚Äôre also extremely rare, stop acting like aren‚Äôt. another downvote.  pretty much have. appreciate people like SA variant irrelevant. managed grow significantly UK UK variant, given transmissible Indian variant new global dominant variant, even less chance grow. PPE stockpiles. work gradually right instead using trash bags haz mat suits week 2 next pandemic. biggest brains allowed work ""study"". next project figure sun rises east? Yep Sheetz too. also really depends area even care enforce it.  really getting point banning photos say trust immune system fight covid?

Can agree Covid bad? Lets start there, can't post moot, lets say agree. Covid bad. lets also say arguments sake immune system stellar, lets say want vaccine, lets imagine got Covid, barely effected you. Lets say Covid survivor. think slight chance may exposed someone else Covid sick? loved one? stranger? person's immune system terrible? person died? die, went party spread Covid tens people? 

Now know, lot assumptions, I'm getting Covid spread incredibly easily, effects everyone differently. want get shot, choice, personally think selfish choice, choice. getting vaccine harmless helps everyone equally not. get. covid. I'm hoping agree good thing. I'm getting people go online spread word going get vaccinated, proud getting vaccinated, inspires others get vaccinated, means Covid going stick around kill people, again, I'm making wild assumption, assuming helping people live good thing. yes, think getting point banning photos say trust immune system, that....... protecting OTHERS may weak immune systems, protecting others can't get vaccine selfish what's best humanity. 60% came NPR, used vaccine eligibility calculate it.   think people would fine people like us died  jealous almost like vaccines work! Pretty sure shadow political polarization. Rural = Republican. spelled rockets wrong. That's issue ra ra side. kinda disgusting people want Texas Florida mass deaths. Regardless differences, still human beings. Israelis set terrorism always plausible deniability. Bomb media building? Hamas using base. Bomb road leading hospital? Hamas tunnel it. 

In reality, Israel employs ""Dahia Doctrine"", aims punish civilian population supporting terrorists. form terrorism itself, well collective punishment, og illegal. I‚Äôm one saying that, so. must fun parties Hedging bets trying get people right thing. think mockery necessary. Im vaccinated wear mask kids wear masks. 

But get crazy looks vaccinated people look like im crazy antivaxx get looks antimaskers bcecause... Antimaskers Exactly. course ways could managed one better I‚Äôm highly doubtful could prevented it. matter much invest pandemic preparedness hard identify new disease, identify pattern symptoms look for, develop mass produce testing equipment, shut travel quickly enough prevent pandemic interconnected modern world.  basically, avoiding issue. Gotcha. lady diabetes high blood pressure. guy Leukemia.

This sounds exactly like people claiming COVID big problem last year. ""he fat, matter""

Just taking high blood pressure alone.... that's 45% American adults. Invest billions developing mRNA vaccines possible mutations viruses already know about. huge part defense budget. source obvious deductive reasoning. there's national mask mandate, make rules remove something there? [""Why closed? Tell us think so. recent polling floating around vaccine refusal rate like 20-25%. think almost certainly hit Biden's 70% adults goal point summer, hard see enter fall much higher 75ish% eligible population ~65% total many people dead set getting vaccine. said, may matter since total protection including natural immunity would probably 75-80% 65% vaccinated. felony fake ID buying alcohol. Surely understand something federal charge would require much store clerk checking briefly data would like, I'll gladly show studied showing vaccines better protection masks.

Why acting like said masks better vaccines? said nothing sort. course vaccines way better masks. even understand think said something differently. said daughter low risk wearing mask public extended period time (which specifically said go restaurant.)

So yeah, go ahead show data following says short periods time masked public still risky. saying. inconvenience minority people time. Handicapped spaces? It‚Äôs called decent society. 60% US. 60% eligible Americans right? fantastic news imagine 7 day average continue fall next couple days well given cases lowest they‚Äôve since early days pandemic started vaccinating 12-15 year olds. Unfortunately number vaccines given US continued drop looks like vaccine hesitancy really going big issue shouldn‚Äôt stop us reopening dropping mask mandates.  Every single person store buying alcohol? verify everyone inside vaccinated employees would check card every single person enters building kinda both. flu, would right focused fomite transmission aerosol. already becoming dangerous slower pace anti-vaxers. pandemic let speed up, there's even anti-vaxers. Texas pretty well. two nieces nephew school outside Houston option wearing mask face shield class. 

For part, people still wearing masks stores per store policy. noticed apocalyptic things going either since mask mandate rescinded. pediatrician using population-level stats popation vs. Covid.

Yeah that's medicine works. research samples population estimate something total population use info guide practice specific people. understand expecting btw.

Elaborate. Source reference ""most cases long covid actually psychosomatic manifestation"" anxiety? good stuff! think concerns beyond rationality point. someone else vaccinated risk two virtually zero. variants big deal far vaccines go. Even get breakthrough case, it‚Äôs unlikely symptomatic extremely unlikely severe. Unless elderly and/or severely immunocrompomised, vaccine pretty much guaranteed prevent severe case happening.

At point, getting car bigger risk life covid is. don‚Äôt bug every time get car you?

Chill out. Hang vaccinated friend. Everything fine. seriously need it. lot posters handling stage pandemic well.  Reality starting set may last forever they're upset that.

Why would people upset it?  Ugh, deal former guy, states fighting (and federal government!) emergency supplies. 

The central government throwing hands rather coordinating is, sadly, sign administrative incompetence top. He's already COVID. like 3 weeks barely functioning. Little memory all, since incredibly ill dad started ""turn worse"" week got vaccinated, means there's big cover-up MSM thing killing people reported. CDC set policy. made clear statement: vaccinated need mask. Anything else politics.

The CDC also says smoke. CDC also says drink 1 2 drinks day. 

They make policy, expect come policy combat anti-vaxers weird.  Genuine question, trying unnecessarily dramatic anything. I'm reasonably caught news around covid. effective mainstream vaccines (pfizer/moderna, AZ, J&amp;J) covid variant spreading India?

I'm Indian, several people family families three closest friends people infected covid *after* getting single shot AZ vaccine. One died, severe symptoms requiring hospitalization, bad coughs fevers.

The articles read online seem split opinions whether vaccines remain effective Indian variant (and so, degree). Though news back home seems indicate AZ vaccine effective anymore. deal variant? single shot simply sufficient anymore? vaccines work effectively anymore?  Nine deaths entire state lot better Canada CDC‚Äôs policy? They‚Äôre calling end universal masking. actual recommendation matters unvaccinated need wear masks. 

They punted question universal masking local leaders. 100% people getting vaccinated. risk always think also still feels scarce lucky get one dose. Wheras state, time opened everyone lot enthusiasm waned. lot people wanted interested anymore everyone could get it. also get false sense paranoia shows negative. also don‚Äôt check B cell immunity. Let's close entirely now!  Store workers thing alcohol every day. hard. unfair. one complains.

What data would like, I'll gladly show studied showing vaccines better protection masks. hope vaccination efforts US needed less less coming months shift needed areas overseas like India, Brazil, etc. USA adopted strategy, cases would already much lower lot lives would saved. know next pandemic ""fully vaccinated"" population skyrocket two months

Doubt it. First doses going weeks, reason think skyrocket month (which would time fully vaccinated two months now). got small bounce among 12-15 year olds rushing get it, that's likely last two long they'll start trickling 30 eligible states month so

And first wave, they've trickling in. reason expect rates increase substantially.

The expectation required vaccines already affecting many people's decisions. Full authorization vaccine requirements cause skyrocket, workplaces schools likely implement restrictions slowly. Hospital day full approval, Hospital B, week later, etc.

Charts: Sort ""People receiving Dose Switch sorting age see 30s trickling point.  really depending providing data‚Äôs, vaccine range 20-90% efficient reported different governing body countries, study data really valid book. 3-6% different efficient norm, wide range ew. curious looked far northern states like Maine, Michigan, Wisconsin didn‚Äôt really summer spike Arizona Florida had. spikes peaked mid-late July roughly corresponds hottest point summer. (The coverage ‚Äú2nd wave‚Äù spike may caused people careful dips pretty quickly even though September July almost temperature average.) may validity theory. 

Winter think still see increase cases since even warm climates, people spend holidays inside sharing meals, opening gifts, etc.  cares small % winning would be. getting vaccination shot free. downside player perspective profit somehow miraculously win. haven‚Äôt called anyone task, including US, I‚Äôm pointing statement best partially correct somewhat misleading. 

There‚Äôs also difference keeping supply buying global supply. Brazil hasn‚Äôt even done former. 

And there‚Äôs matter refusing make patent exceptions even face global pandemic. here, see commenter still understand exponential growth year pandemic. Except 1000 fully vaccinated people who've hospitalized, 200+ people who've died. 

Given couple months since even enough fully vaccinated people start counting, number going rise. wild strawman appeared! know require passports vaccine-preventable diseases, right? do. different way. Kids required vaccinated many diseases go school. Obviously, work introduce new vaccine adult population, go differently. totally surpassed expectations.  evidence. Every vaccinated person gets cancer, suffers infertility, gets hit bus evidence amount explaining statistics convince otherwise.

A neighbor posting social media friend got diagnosed stage 4 breadt cancer week vaccination. stage 4 beeast cancer grows week. Look Uttar Pradesh's population density GDP per capita public place supposed bouncer checks everyone‚Äôs vaccine card come in?  solution store workers, many teens elderly, ones check vaccine cards determine validity vaccination card? think unfair people.

I agree people forgeries prosecuted making call? Go ahead lay plan.

Lastly, go ahead show data seen indicate daughter danger wearing mask. Seriously, want say I'm wrong, prove it. literally know nothing know go ahead prove wrong here.

But remember: Feelings equal facts plural anecdote data.

I'll wait. Honestly: unvaccinated people people wearing masks count death totals anymore.

Just call suicides put asterisk next names.

This important distinction future look long term economic costs compensation funds survivors benefits. CDC said unvaccinated people continue wear masks. You‚Äôre making seem like don‚Äôt consider risk. 

They even go far require EVERYONE mask mass transit, hospitals, schools, prisons. how‚Äôs sub full people really best 0.1% population falls bucket?

The US won‚Äôt see another wave. chances hospitals overwhelmed close 0 even opened 100% today.

I‚Äôve made tremendous sacrifices last year, including lose service industry job, seeing family friends, living alone unable date 16 months now.

Cases 1/10th peak, might even get 1/100th month. remember, vulnerable already protected.

It‚Äôs individuals make individual risk assessments like responsible adults. you‚Äôre immunocompromised, find solace fact cases &lt; 3k/day month. Meanwhile, stock N-95s (they cheap days) stay home get groceries delivered. I‚Äôve 16 months ffs, month life depends it.  I'm sure reading reply negative snarky comment? 

I asking checking weather facebook since actual weather sites check. need facebook all. snarky rude mean comment implied reply. Sorry came across way, that's all. actually curious why. Florida. lol  presume got shots kid boosters adult? Ever long term side effects? Probably not, cause that‚Äôs really thing vaccines. Hundreds millions gotten various COVID vaccines starting folks trials middle last year. They‚Äôre ok! flat wrong. completely incorrect Rt well incorrect metrics. Nothing pedantic it. 

You're happy we're going that's fine, glossing happened spreading misinformation process dismissing risks involved decisions got us point. know, still doesn‚Äôt inconvenience removes doubts Every pandemic come animals, huge hurdle overcome, huge burden proof, want say ""this time different"". Nah, give year two however opposition scream money wasted stuff demand canceled.

Over germany try stick merkel last year order million worth PPE went bad quality junked. drop bucket made difference lots choice suppliers back then...  10-11 days ago, I'm guessing 2nd dose shipment.  long wait since March. co-workers india able WFH. Lots good people there, hopefully vaccines supplies coming. Lots countries vested interest happens india light fires world leaders/corporations. blew away too. Hand soap shortages? hell people before?

My usage hand soap increased tad perhaps, supply-chain-damaging amount.

I \*hope\* hoarders ruining everyone, like toilet paper mess. Makes feel better. They‚Äôve got balls, unlike Singaporean ministers that‚Äôs sure. Many things lead increase excess deaths. reduction cancer screenings regular health checkups likely rather significant impact. estimating 10% increase cancer deaths. personally little, nothing, vaccine development, everything current hesitancy take it. People family are, like, ""India's *per capita* covid deaths top 100 world"" tryna convince official count probably (**small**) fraction real numbers... I've heard nicely fits vaccine-avoidance pattern.

Too many people use religion excuse keep whatever want try ignore responsibility. Clearwater/Tampa masks popular. rural problem. Vaccine passports federal charges forging government documents would excellent solution then. 

It seems like lots people downvoting you. seem know much science. Well, lot limitations here. small number patients (25) study one. other, serious opinion, effectiveness vaccine *was* reduced eliminated. article says, team‚Äôs data show antibodies generated vaccination seven times less effective blocking B.1.617.1 neutralizing coronavirus strain circulated early pandemic. antibodies 25 vaccinated people able neutralize B.1.617.1 extent.

One hope ""some extent"" still enough present vaccines 'tweaked' spokespeople keep saying. looks like link shared behind paywall, study Clinical Infectious Diseases journal (CID) found symptoms COVID worse dengue fever, mortality actually lower them. leads theory possibly dengue fever antibodies provide protection Covid19. antivaxxers terrified vaccinated people ""shedding viral particles"" they're going wearing masks.

If anti-maskers/anti-vaxxers want stay hell away family catch particles, I'm it.

That includes aunt uncle asshole kids ""I medical condition wear mask"" cards. care ever see again.  fair enough! Honestly, refreshing understand humor. win! 70% state either, using number example. dropped adding 12-15 year olds ""eligible"" category county. around 60 that. Except were. pediatrician using population-level stats efficacy vs. Covid. Incorrectly, btw. reason incirrect interpretation pediatrician expert things. definitely think 15 year old able choose things. weird cant. cards even accepted proof vaccination anywhere? remember Canadians keying american cars Canada.

Quite strawman. Awesome! could find open appointment yesterday, expect good news. lot parents get first days.

I'm really hoping enough vaccimate masks outdoors summer camp required. argument temporary, there's way we'll get rights back things look now.

Or think free travel EU thing again? Two weeks lockdown temporary, one year like restrictions look like dropping year either. Perhaps definition ""temporary"" ten years. it‚Äôs ridiculous. CDC said fully vaccinated don‚Äôt wear masks settings. Let‚Äôs pick choose decide follow CDC guidance. bother? little vague say report appropriate state agency. assume would police maybe county health agency. Thanks! I‚Äôve actually seen two friends barbecue neighbors, I‚Äôm seeing best friend Thursday support worker going outdoor flea market next month. concerned wrong thing hanging people.

My mom still paranoid covid despite fully vaccinated, still wears gloves touching objects like mail wears gloves establishments. also tells there‚Äôs still high chance getting virus even point. even prevented going job interview reason. trying work less contact her. It‚Äôs easy. time may loosen fear. access entire source list moment study echoes several studies I've read. basically depends medication prescribed amount. Remicade Methotrexate fairly high dose severe disease comparable transplant patients. Steroids like Prednisone shown worst impact vaccine effectiveness antimetabolites like Methotrexate bad too. Anti-TNF biologics like Remicade Humira impact apparently GI told fine.  

My GI disclose impacts Methotrexate late rather upset him. YUP. I‚Äôm saying Trump supported vaccines get jabs people‚Äôs arms absurdly fast time shouldn‚Äôt disregarded. see satire now. good. Huh?

This would allow *drive* US, something could before. CDC issuing guidelines left businesses decide want follow not. White House mask mandate public transportation ends September. 45% Americans also age 75 with, quote, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, high blood pressure mild dementia?

Outlier. think mask mandate matter honor system. fact enough people vaccinated spread become exponentially harder. fact everyone needs vaccinated, fact need enough people vaccinated virus can't spread nearly easily. eventually die out. question think long-COVID anxiety. anxiety cause chronic ear infections, chronic pink eye, tinnitus, foot numbness sun burnt feeling skin even hardly anxious? genuinely curious anxiety never caused things yet suffered long time COVID March 2020. Going restaurant, wearing one table, taking eat, putting back leave table. Yeah, that's I'd get it. Oh yeah heard 96 year old died covid vaccinated, poor guy argument smoking affect health around you, especially staff gets exposed time. happen alcohol.  Pick orders options people even pandemic. thread talking safe option inside stores vaccinated immune compromised. don‚Äôt need mask getting vaccinated since can‚Äôt spread it, you‚Äôre getting crazy looks vaccinated people cautious behavior making things safe dangerous..it‚Äôs completely pointless, resident NJ, wish governor would Follow Science Trust Experts. Yes. giving 1M doses day beginning distribution. Every vaccine dose manufactured quickly injected someone‚Äôs arm. 

Biden barely tweaked distribution system. It‚Äôs operating designed intended start. issue Biden admin causing great vaccine hesitancy ridiculous policies like telling fully vaccinated people still mask can‚Äôt congregate holidays. They‚Äôve recently changed stance seeing much impact causing. They're banning photos. hosting frames option offered Facebook. still edit photos photo editing software include frame says something dumb. Hospitals aren‚Äôt always issue - county state offices may update concern false positive rapid test, since that's one shown positive. I'm trying figure window could still show positive symptoms cleared. see info still testing positive months later, finding anything far testing negative quickly (meaning 10 day quarantine window passed). No, 3/5 Compromise got decided House Representatives anyone even raised idea electoral college. Exactly, states US worn entire time. Spoke people plane Nebraska said first time deal masks aside going clinic there. Meanwhile state strict mask mandates, everyone followed them, nothing changed. understand people hard people still wanting wear masks businesses taking cautious approach time being. Personally I'm think fully vaccinated people wear one anymore, still certain situations big deal, I'll slap mask required that's that. someone fully vaccinated feels safer comfortable masking affect anyone else's life way, shape, form. people way much time hands.   fully vaccinated getting Covid ‚Äúall time‚Äù.

People use condoms birth control pills get pregnant ""all time too"", whole hell lot less people unprotected sex. People wear seatbelts get killed accidents ""all time"" whole hell lot less people don't. People wear motorcycle helmets die crashes, people smoke cigarettes get cancer, people smoke detectors houses still die fires, etc. I'm ""literally"" advocating that. Read usernames. comment started remark cigarettes. ‚Äúmask theatre‚Äù doesn‚Äôt seem ‚Äúscientific‚Äù you? them, like boss, legitimately ""waiting seeing"". majoritybof workers fine, he's going get it. least one coworkers refusing, saying ""he know it"" refuses look it.  bet never reads ingredients food consumes. Driving right though, leaving house is. call World Health Organization ""WHO"" short! Looks like see actual approval rating PA's governors response today, primary PA, 2 questions limit governors power emergency declarations. recommended take preventatively beforehand take experience side think people US proud made far, despite amount people trying directly indirectly make mess all.  can‚Äôt wait day sub becomes irrelevant.  Except CDC always page comes recommendations. would CDC stick recommendations help China? 


Wouldn't plausible reason that's consensus medical advice globally time? 


It's hard say organization pro-China, ignore evidence world's powerful national health organization run Anti-Chinese gov't (at time), ok following said pro-China organization's lead. Probably even $100. Sure well-off people wouldn't, wipe away TON people.

Even $25, honestly. I'd say government put public health memo saying masks strongly recommended first weeks January. people wear them, flu season hopefully little less severe. there, might widely adopted flu season there's noticeable change severity. connected. 3/5ths compromise exist without electoral college. cdc call universal unmasking. punted local leaders. explicitly say unvaccinated need masked. propose ensure recommendation followed? submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Getting vaccine itself, no.

*Forcing* said vaccine (or vaccine passports), let alone companies responsible even liable injury death, yes. much fucking hand hold grown adults conscious functional facilities, though? simple fact we're gonna reach something past herd immunity soon, via people take seriously. That's many would say lockdowns, never attempted 2020. man looking healthy Nothing wrong changing opinion data comes out. Hell masks months started last year. started noticing things seem scientific all. Wearing outside seemed like waste time start example, science proven case. Realized theater making people feel safe anything. Here's thing patient one another. I've patient year now. waited vaccine, got it, even fully vaccinated month now. I'm simply done mask theater. It‚Äôs also good reminder pandemic cost us LOT $1M. $1M gets us even small step towards herd immunity incredible return investment. let know it‚Äôs ‚Äúyour choice‚Äù continue coming office share fact you‚Äôve picked freak case leprosy. /s

Good idea looking new job! That‚Äôs kind attitude need making decisions *anything* workplace. Shows much know. Trump massively supportive vaccines form get-go. paused administration J&amp;J (rightfully) called stupid creating vaccine hesitancy. 

Operation warp speed massively important, even though Democrats try belittle it. Trump‚Äôs full fledged support vaccines experts unsure nation administering millions vaccines day term even up. leaving states (the correct method Biden continues) allowed us get far vaccinations day amongst nations. Covid denier here. You‚Äôre busted! claiming ‚ÄúPeople going growing third head year‚Äù admitted second head grow within year!! 
And third head grow, years. knew it!!


/sarcasm one welcome Canadian friends back! worry there's plenty vaccine go around. Unfortunately lot people well....shall say reject science. help guys out, better! invented vaccine robot yet . Well, source whole EU then? already here, transitioning one medical job another provide proof COVID vaccination willing get new employer. definitely get nature‚Äôs vaccine then. CDC said mask requirements wasn‚Äôt them. say unvaccinated needed mask up. propose businesses local govt leaders ensure follow advice? also can't considered expert even accurate view things outside, probably talk 10 20 people located India day job, direct reports there. assessment half people know sick given point time. assessment sending way many condolences loss family lately. Way peak US. California? Central Valley? common cold symptoms, Covid. There‚Äôs cold going around family, too. I'll avoid insulting parents' intelligence ask care eat Indian food little while? good point! news story people could able go stateside get second vaccine, essential medical grounds, cashing chips might tricky getting doctors note it. appointment stateside unless email copy. [But news  honestly don‚Äôt know could look someone eye callous human life.

That‚Äôs sociopathic point is; yes, restrictions effective mitigation tools. no, cherry picking various locations different times disprove that.  35% unvaxxed people infected, makes 74% adults least immunity.  like need show proof reason vaccine effective understanding basics vaccines work. impossible strain bw ineffective vaccine. Without changing drastically, would longer infect humans. research stop part fear mongering problem.  want *KEEP* babies hope vaccinate them.

Hepatitis B, Tetanus (lockjaw), Diphtheria, Polio, Haemophilus influenzae type B, Pertussis (whooping cough): *no thanks.*

Better ensure *you've* previously chicken pox vaccinated preganacy well: supposedly harmless varicella can, rare occasion, cause birth defects threaten life newborn. exposed chicken pox pregnant vaccinated previously infected, would sure contact doctor right away immunoglobulin treatment.  include Texas Florida? two states Californians mocked getting rid mask require weeks California removed own? remember TJ's Southern California. expanded Northern California big deal. Yes, is! Texas union people? people elect represent them? FUCK. I'm going Tennessee vacation  surprised hero Katalin Kariko comes tell us ""the mRNA vaccines meant target aging... yet"" What‚Äôs cost wearing mask? many adults die kids infect them?  good start would be: ""new disease pops up, global travel stopped immediately""

I hearing new disease Wuhan full month even first travel bans going place. live Canada. Canada prioritized nothing, supply point government researching mixing matching second doses even though side effects. ...assuming current vaccination rates remain constant October 1, know won't.  exercise day getting Pfizer vaccine first dose? Like 40km bike ride 2 hours after? story Indian coworkers. I'm getting ""so work today mother / father-in-law / uncle RIP"" week right now. India massive place, information State could entirely different State B... unlike US previously trying compare NY LA Dallas.

Unfortunately people shilling Modi big time well. (again unlike situation US last summer) Vaccines work, period. you‚Äôre banning swimming pools bath tubs, justifying 2 children dying every day?

Or understand costs responding risk cost risk itself?

Kids risk COVID, less risk flu. child likely die car accident riding get COVID vaccine dying COVID. another issue today server pharmacies use report data down. see compensatory reporting later week. anyone tested positive fully vaccinated? I've sore throat runny nose week, pushed allergies anxiety acting up. Now, mom similar thing cough. We're fully vaccinated, I'm worried since work retail. first shot gave sore arm evening.  Systemic effects hit 6 days later. Unless something else caught, chances? 2nd dose happened yet. fact we're coming 50% w/ one dose 30-39 age group 40% 18-29 encouraging, think given hesitancy (or whatever want call it) groups.

‚ÄúWhy veterinarian‚Äôs think remain closed‚Äù  says reasonable understandable businesses would still requiring masks given current situation, necessary prevent spread.

That's ASS backwards, folks! look numbers around see slight downward trend, one still hundreds folks hospitalized consistant deaths. see hospitalizations deaths moved younger younger age brackets older folks opportunity get vaccinated. people family cannot get vaccinated yet current medical recommendations continue quarantine. informed employer expect return in-person workplace 2022 earliest expect wear masks social distance next year, whether vaccinated not. (Specifically, say Legal concluded may ask whether vaccinated not, safety protocols required assume fully unvaccinated workplace.) leave home, I'm still legally required wear mask everywhere go.

I look numbers glad things improving, hundreds people per day suffering permanent injury death still heck situation. looks good compare winter, horrifying compare baseline mortality normal year. probably noted putting bodies river bit funereal tradition India, it? mean, death count tragic, outsiders looks like something completely batshit extraordinary. I'm Ohio.

vaccines bio-energy shield. Youll get infected chances die end in-hospital way lower

But things ypu tell people.


1) Researches working studyingn mRNA vaccines around decades.

2)The vaccine doesnt enter tge nucleus cell change DNA. merely triggers ab immune response body prepared Covid.

3) billion people worldwide vaccinated 100 mil US. 

4) negative effects things seen shorter term. fact billion people getting basically bad news outstanding.  No? made comment wrong post deleted People like origin stories/prequels? common Japan  Yeah another week half go full vaccination (though got covid week ago bit protection anyway). I‚Äôm still wearing mask everywhere go.  Also, order even *remotely* suggest causality prove non-spuriousness variables. article state officials claiming efficacy policy two days announcing slight bump of...1,500 people got vaccinated Friday.

This, course, also Friday people presumably next day deal potential side effects. addition, day DeWine announced lottery also announced impending lift mask mandate, it‚Äôs impossible know people getting vaccine Friday lottery, know mask mandate leaving soon, random statistical anomaly happens time.

The fact DeWine administration spinning victory lazy dishonest, unsurprising coming politicians. fact you‚Äôre almost week later posting like sort victory lap lazy dishonest.  do? Super sucks. target now.   doesn‚Äôt. AZ vaccine isn‚Äôt administered USA. Oh mean people lie vaccinated, order go stores establishments without mask? people?

The ones effectively spread also increase breakthrough infections vaccinated? ones who, via repeated infections, keep pushing virus mutations vaccines mean fuckall? non-mask wearers?

Well least CDC sort provide common sen- oh wait.  I‚Äôd suggest reading difference Covid Vaccine EUAs full FDA approval. Note, it‚Äôs pretty much paperwork particular case. 

‚ÄúAn EUA COVID-19 vaccine requires two-month waiting period data ‚Äúfrom least one well-designed Phase 3 clinical trial demonstrates vaccine‚Äôs safety efficacy clear compelling manner.

Vaccine side-effects almost never emerge two months.

The core difference EUA full FDA-approval four additional months observation already-completed trials.‚Äù

Full article (more young child shots, goes depth EUAs). Ridiculous! maybe, don‚Äôt think work plan. People changed throughout whole thing. gotten skinnier learned cook. spending frivolously convenience type stores much anymore. Others realized don‚Äôt really want things find means employment continue working home.

Employers require states condition employment responsible bad reaction.   US ages less 1 month (April 19). I‚Äôm hopeful least see improved uptake. pretty screwed life could significantly damaged test positive asymptomatic vaccinated person. counterproductive.  Right dumb! Walmart many places.. beware US 60% I‚Äôm listening Slow Burn podcast Iraq war 3 happened Jesus, everyone really supported shit? Well, better start wearing protect genetic material shedding vaccinated people! /s  thinking could finally go stores vaccinated, everyone masked up. way hell I'm setting foot stores now, Covidiots running around unmasked lying vaccinated. using Instacart curbside pickup groceries since pandemic began. curbside people even wear masks now, I'm going everything delivered 100%. terrible decision stores cases going get worse now. 1/3rd US vaccinated (and much further) pull shit.

Obligatory source: medical researcher, laws biochemists attended symposium Fauci key researchers Ohio State Yale presented findings indicating variants appear covered examining genetic clinical viewpoints. Ohio's mask mandate wont end another 2 weeks. People still wearing Wal Mart lady sits door handing surgical mask longer sits front entrance. thought odd then, got inside, people wore mask didn't.

Several aquatic organisms loaches evolved unique intestinal breathing mechanisms survive extensive hypoxia. date, highly controversial whether capability adapted mammalian species another site gas exchange. Here, report advent intestinal breathing phenomenon mammalians exploiting EVA (enteral ventilation via anus). 
Methods 
Two different modes EVA investigated experimental model respiratory failure: intra-rectal oxygen O2 gas ventilation (g-EVA) liquid ventilation (l-EVA) oxygenated perfluorocarbon. induction type 1 respiratory failure, analyzed effectiveness g-EVA I-EVA mouse pig, followed preclinical safety analysis rat. 
Findings 
Both intra-rectal O2 gas oxygenated liquid delivery shown provide vital rescue experimental models respiratory failure, improving survival, behavior, systemic O2 level. rodent porcine model study confirmed tolerable repeatable features enema-like l-EVA procedure major signs complications. 
Conclusions 
EVA proven effective mammalians oxygenated systemic circulation ameliorated respiratory failure. Due proven safety perfluorochemicals clinics, EVA potentially provides adjunctive means oxygenation patients respiratory distress conditions.

When last announced timelines said even get 70 years like June first dose cautious. Today biggest province opened adults mid May.

The second dose timelines move well, studies UK suggesting longer interval may actually beneficial well. said ""If"" in, future. time now, could month. likely wait children vaccinated great amounts masks necessary. that's said ""I care..."": read again

what happened? can't read? really tough regulate. look /r/gunsarecool sub, brigaded years nothing done, even though everyone knows what's going on. ran similar problem another sub noticed comments flipping like +20 like -20 matter like hour. mods basically told hands tied unless could find source it. Yeah sure. honest I'm kind mixed. Like, I'm vaccinated feel like need start getting used going accepting larger exposure risk given safe. glad least see arena still forcing masks (but obviously many people getting amped watching playoff game going tons shouting, booing, screaming, cheering otherwise masks getting pulled - air tainted sure). 

I starting feel like unfortunate thing want vaccinated either can't due allergies blocking factors. likely \~15% COVID deniers get matter - feel they've made choice time keep holding everyone back them. That's personal responsibility works guess, long hospitals get bogged down. 

NYT really good article actually 4 major groups people see vaccine hesitant. actually interesting see flat COVID skeptics lower (I think nationwide like 13%, worst state 23%). 48.1 % May 17. referring 60% eligible adults? find hilarious mods deleted well thought, long well grounded reality post ""low quality information"" incoherent one liner referring thread one year ago replying stays up. Think money states spending advertising staff. May well give money person.  Vaccinated people present little risk it‚Äôs greater zero vaccinated person everyone encounter numbers better shouldn‚Äôt change anything. us got getting vaccines believe work things normal people vaccinated including travel.. US done great job vaccine rollout we're slowwwly catching Canada. yeah see reason travel can't happen vaccinated Depends.

Does getting Indian variant COVID provide immunity it? so, irrelevant poorer countries hit herd immunity thresholds infections (sadly). neutralize SA variant.

If not, getting vaccinated effectively strains B.1.351 mean B.1.351 one left infecting people.

I look UK data sure, feel there's selective pressure escape mutations. LoVe CoLd sInCe 2^(0)1^9 Correct. We're getting close 50% total population though!  agree. last year taught us anything, people assholes care themselves. it?

Feel free keep downvoting every time respond. acting like attacking daughter's health merely trying assure risks (you know, effing science?) think agree accepting. whatever. seems comment contains 1 links hard tap mobile users. 
I extend they're easier sausage fingers click!

^Please ^PM ^/u/eganwall ^with ^issues ^or ^feedback! ^| Sometimes headline doesnt match numbers article. said ""they're proven right government power grabs"" something like that, right? That's conspiracy theory. believe conspiracy theorist. believe that?

""Only threat elderly obese""

Yeah. definitely conspiracy theorist certainly benefits older Pennsylvanians. Yes. viruses work. That's research update vaccine year. way help prevent spread severity cases. trying claim vaccines work people still get sick? gonna also claim seatbelts work people still die car crashes? number using 85% fully vaccinated individuals denominator whole population.

With 45M children currently ineligible incredibly unlikely they'll eligible time fully vaccinated October 1st, basically impossible us hit number date. bought way out. lives cash. American lives. lives countries skipped paying premium. countries deal lack vaccine bought all. He's nutty homeopath now. worth looking at. Ah didn‚Äôt realize local businesses kept mandates. Thanks important detail missing! President reaffirmed commitment leading international coordinated vaccination effort, **announcing U.S. donate 80 million U.S. vaccines** ‚Äì 60 million doses AstraZeneca vaccines previously announced least additional 20 million doses U.S. authorized vaccines end June. many gloves need gloves keep gloves getting dirty?"
