^^^^/s Lol 100% correct answer Thanks thinking us! outbreak school February-March got it. *sucked* I’m praying start school won’t furloughed anything Outdoors + mask = low risk transmission exactly. Get sleep, stay hydrated, eat better, exercise, stop smoking drinking, ween prescription drugs, boost immune system. would much effective vaccine could ever do. 

Its literally mutated flu killed mainly really old people really sick people. numbers highly inflated push political economic agendas. RIP Angel Oxygen. o7 RemindMe! 10 Weeks Lol, me? talking hear irritable blaming wife. state gov. made interview three months ago told state record, week ago posted numbers few. number nebraska puts lie. larger. month state got billion dollars. way one gets dont wear mask, also open 100 percent. sit say already skip phases avoided shut down. people country country starving, losing homes, ones hold billions keep people unemployment ones slaved wealth gain. get jack shit. funny systems work collect money time give back systems fail. money give back. yet plenty reprint.  


its shit show end. hidout avoid cause dont worry it. screw ones got jobs. wealth. point im done all. much people suffer dieing, media, gov, could care less argue like school children playground. instead acting like leaders protecting. always politicalize single damn thing. could would politicalize water.

Instead refunded whole $4,500, Jan-April left without insurance April. finally got right May took $1,100 montly payment bank doctor's assigned said insurance active tried use it. went September finally cancelled again, thousands $s hole. Worst thing kept trying bill rest year even though closed bank account (switched banks nothing insurance) 3 months non payment went credit report even know year later. I'm Arizona... guys getting tests? Yep, truly pee O'd Next stop climate change healthy relationship requires space. stuck home 24/7 spouse kids sudden, top stress pandemic, puts ton strain relationship, even marriage healthy loving before. problem really need large sample sizes lot time find unusual reactions. everyone rushing everything limit. think limit use higher risk people first may still acceptable risk/benefit ratio rushing vaccine safety might work well long run. one first vaccines actually turns negative effects people avoid even vaccines. good safety testing super important. would view extreme skepticism. sure send amazing reviews **Is quarantine required flying country listed high-risk country transiting another flight within airport's transit zone high-risk country?**

So, therefore, question. Like [The without man-made component unhealthy dose incompetence. Fair enough. wanted point today, France done worse U.S. covid response.

I feel bad like mock given state affairs, Aus employers given $3000/mo per employee help cover wages (provided lost 30%+ revenue), job seekers given $2250/month help living costs. definitely played (and continues play) big part getting people accept lockdowns - toll business there.

Then put damn mask cause scene! states ordered hospitals provide data.  Mental issues play obviously.

Tested symptoms clinic said can't come general checkup. Sorry late reply, went bed. Let check links finished day working. really negotiations date. couple conversations current funding needs reserves previous legislative packages,"" official said. ""The President fully committed robust aid package addresses real needs. remains 14.7 billion dollars NIH CDC previous cares act allocations discussions start earnest Monday. 

The title article little misleading. first stimulus bill allocated billions dollars NIH CDC, help fight Coronavirus. discussing next stimulus bill, became apparent CDC NIH finished spending money received first stimulus bill... debates whether much funding need next stimulus bill. *setting budget NIH CDC zero*, title article implying.

I'm worried new reporting requirements hospital test results go directly HHS, rather CDC. seems like combination cronyism, and/or political infighting. give hope making one country. Brazil signed deal make tens millions think. Also India deal make hundreds millions doses eventually billion doses specifically developing countries. American? Good. Fuck country’s ignorance Human life economy. economic crash waiting us means crash human life. delusional think ""millions people"" going die US. 

It really bothers people claim care human life quick call devestation millions American lives without mention financial assistance. goes show little people actually care others concerned feeling right. 

As far I'm concerned, talks economic shut without also talking going get money peoples hands. Otherwise trading one kind human destruction another kind human destruction. normal trumpists. usually diaper like leader. guess lady forgot day.

If school closes, wealthy families hit. poor families. Children whose parents can't guarantee three meals day. Children's whose parents remote jobs can't afford childcare without going work. Children going exposed anyway parents come home work. besides that, there's many families stable access internet, computers, supplies work. let's even get started domestic violence abusive households.

As new mother, would rather rack credit cards send child school - getting income. fortunate privileged savings, qualify unemployment, also skill transfer remotely. home prepared everything child could need build education even wonderful roommates provide social atmosphere child. *very* lucky. many people position.

Could problems lead contaminants water already know? ban protests it’s violation first amendment constitution speaking difference rules regarding hijabs vs. masks prevent covid-19 transmission, since context obviously different, since want go there, think worth looking current status pandemic country.

**7-day moving averages..**

France: 5.52 new cases per day per 1 million people

United States: 208.12 new cases per day per 1 million people

&amp;#x200B;

France: 0.3 deaths per day per 1 million people

United States: 2.4 deaths per day per 1 million people

&amp;#x200B;

So US currently 8x many deaths per day per capita France.

If well France, we'd registering \~1,800 new cases per day, 70,000, we'd seeing \~99 deaths/day, 790.

France got hit hard early on, like many regions (including US's New York tri-state area), done fairly well managing virus since then. situation US right joke, absurd argue US better France point pandemic.

&amp;#x200B;

I got data here, btw:  would astonishingly stupid. Leaving people unvaccinated reduces effectiveness vaccine people get it. Ok got sick even matter get again? happens catch way tho? Right?! It’s getting scary Turns Alabama isn’t dumbest state Lucky even need speculate. Sweden shutdown still suffered almost much economic impact neighbours, massive bonus dead people. might already case considering weeks taking people get test results. Murica gonna murica point ride let get it... first sentence comment Yeah outbreaks, Netherlands. However, cases slowly rising little nothing currently worried about. People become loose however though. Major airlines taken measures. believe masks mandatory flights. 
I think self isolition really thing anymore people symptoms. prime minister stated symptom free 48 hours, go again. symptoms would think 14 days way exaggerated. feel good stay inside though. master start? huge differences spread coronaviris Netherlands. like this? - includes also critic mask handling US. ""Meanwhile country fractured issues like mask-wearing parts world adopted readily matter common courtesy.""

- Like said ""Make plans economy could survive much smaller US market regards trades""

That articulate add 2 cents mention details boring enough Insight add something valuable Infos article ok reddit comment section imo. Anyone read article own.

But fair understand absolut mean. Many posts written reddit without effort even cross read articles. Trump right always

/s linked article jumped gun bit. Oxford team publishing Lancet today. Assuming news positive (it looks likely mixed bag, degree effectiveness likely) challenge trials come next - big ethical questions answer take place.

The likelihood viable vaccine year end still low, we’ll least know today effective vaccination likely combating pandemic. really change said. infection numbers delayed 2 weeks death numbers delayed 1 week, deaths week ahead otherwise would be. might expect see deaths curve follow infections curve two weeks, would actually track week later different delays. delusional even funny. tired winning yet?

Source: many days exposure COVID test considered reliable?

My sister Victoria, Australia 5 days ago tested today. (Has Covid issues Victoria)

I’m currently house going 80yo grandmothers 5 days. test comes back negative, concern around grandmother?

(My sister contact confirmed cases COVID, curious scout timing) Yeah that;s good point, might better finalize everything sooner. really think roll smooth fast anyway.  tbf, cancun absolutely gives mexican drug cartel experience so. lie. Last sunday (july 12th) US 66 281 cases, evident lot actors.

* closed, heavily restricted, voluntarily held services outdoors remotely since happened
* typically operate large groups 1-2 days week hours week
* [Only \~40% people (US) go church service per month (or and;
* Even fewer going now, church even open, especially higher risk areas
* person liberty skip service feel sick skip work, fear fired, losing hours/wages, etc.; attend sick asymptomatic risk.

Having unmodified traditional services many behavioral hallmarks high-risk activities, think reasonable evaluate way, giving churches greater lesser scrutiny commercial activities functional activities (lecture halls, concerts, cinemas), many similarly restricted.

Merely time spent number people contact, given person likely acquire infection somewhere spend time high-risk contact others (40 hours work versus 0.5-2 hours church); still risk shorter sessions, especially number attendees increases.

The numbers could put forth saying schools safe based percentage infections traced venue. true infected there, also closed extremely high numbers compared venues since pandemic started. Yet sub-population classroom engaged similarly risky activity (graduation party) together saw significant spread would likely occurred classroom behaved similarly. I'm sure, might security thing. tracers peoples personal information details home computer possibly written cost providing vaccine free Vs cost tanking economy due lockdowns...any sensible government make correct choice. That’s can’t generalize everything. Communist sucks economy it’s damn effective health crisis. Look Vietnam, Cuba, North Korea, even China started. contained fire quickly.

Funny enough, friends US ask going come back US start whole thing. I'm like life Germany now, even place liv ein US first all. Second, seen US healthcare system vs German healthcare system? 

Fast forward 4 months, clearly made right decision Never wildest dreams envision incredible disparity happened US Germany.  much economic output people think happening everyone bed sick?

People even die ""but economy"" argument fall apart. I'm amazed yet.. pandemic vaccine 9 months? Seems really optimistic me, would great true.  heart goes 2nd 3rd world countries there, many people treated. India probably biggest risk major outbreak high population density poverty, Lockdown Asap. idiot beach party goers anti maskers fucking listening needs charged bioterrorism. European here, confirm.

F Sorry tell you, plenty ""normal"" people anti-mask. pull shenanigans make news, hear them.)

(I'm pro-mask myself, trying justify going without one. many people around wear masks nothing mental health. politics plus fact denial Covid lot appealing facing truth.)  cases, valves closable. Far likely charge corrupt enough see stay describe, chance:  

Could Florida simply can't reliably produce test results per day? logistical challenge present preventing test-centers swabbing, incubating screening every test real time 100% throughput? 

I still lean towards ""corrupt official"" side, since 10,000 tests divided 67 counties around 150 tests results process day state. Even adjusted population density processing ability, difficult number state reach, let alone outstrip. 

But tbh idea quickly test performed swab result, let alone much scaled up. guess means put hold glassing victoria Safe* Great Jobs, Bahamas.  
The states stable. Never been.

Smallpox. that, negative 14 days get infected, assuming strict quarantine got test got results, meaning negative result means 14 days ago. guess test someone symptomatic different issue, contact tracing surveillance, kind useless. disappointing see world's richest country fuck things badly compared rest world. Yeah NHS, people without easy access guns, police properly trained, etc.

I’m saying America worst categories, bad many overall package terrible compared developed countries. Yes. unfortunate us dependent country care people enough implement appropriate measures. suffer that, much hospitals run capacity ""another state"" transport patients to.

Ps. Thanks para! schools would freaking fall apart without guys! happening comments? people praising man gave oxygen “reasonable price”. anyone paying anything life saving medical care??? cost zero.

I’m dismayed many commenters accepted life saving medical procedures come family pays it. majority first world works. system broken. man “allows” people access oxygen “reasonable price” angel. part problem trying preserve capitalist system healthcare. Yikes guys.... John McAfee, pedophile fled country?

He’s pull quote? experience epidemiology diseases aren’t STDs? He’s horrible. Something else keep mind: last month cut MO Education budget $133 mill also signed funding millions tax dollars building two new prisons. example mindless spending slap face educators. really sad seeing everyday. lot people hotspots coming vacation insist following guidelines. think health officials encouraging work home more. think Americans take seriously needed that. Offices WFH right I'm hot spot. This.  necessarily. People extra panicked never accept anything trigger ""let's go back normal now"" (masks, vaccine, etc.) going go years regardless actual disease risk is. Yea it’s like someone broken legs can’t walk house burning down. fire ultimately killed could walk could survived. 

That’s see underlying conditions. surviving fine covid it’s underlying disease killed them.

This ""America"" caring much economy, american corporations trying exploit survive situation going ravage everyone, great US A, corporations get pass pain employees/customers, receiving multi-million dollar loans billion dollar enterprises, meant small businesses survive keep payroll afloat.

This good news, trail vitro, actual patients. Honestly, post replied highlights America voted Trump. Even left people seemingly wanting vote someone like without considering qualified aren't. knew got approved US like 2013 approved 2009 wave, read ""available commercial purchase"". idea means really figured distributed. 

I'm sorry developed that. know tied certain gene?

I think that's amazing thing study. would liability immunity affect though? still work improving vaccine safety making sure rare circumstances avoided regardless immunity. unless quarantined got test got results, results less meaningless, or? difference someone US parents parents get healthcare decent retirement, whereas poor person US gets debt treatment? best metric comparing testing positivity rate. We'll vaccinate think diseases bad us, like smallpox polio. Measles like problem us, Jenny McCarthy infected us stupid. gotta go see mouse dude hope people realize shut city effectively, need go Wuhan style, blocking streets in/out city. Otherwise, what’s point?

I serious doubts happen. saw first-hand people Texas county ordered (by city officials) stay home. Many went surrounding counties shop, go restaurants, waterparks, parties, etc. small numbers, either.

There many across US brain power process lockdown one smaller scale, IMO. I’m Naples confirm true. boss literally thinks it’s hoax.  It’s one big 2, bbc, still round clock tv news uk. vaccine certainly free, unlike situation. Uninsured people covered Medicaid- say provider paid medicaid, like testing. EDIT except around 3 Million people bought new short term Trumpcare plans...they cover vaccines.


Is source stating this? find slightly unrealistic Sure, facilities produce vaccines too... can't stop producing flu vaccines everyone across planet needs. It'll run pinch felt early august UI paid previous 2 weeks. Congress wrangle ultimately whatever decide anemic version FPUA GOP wants adopt ""back business"" attitude despite ~~2nd~~ 1st wave COVID running unchecked right now. Capitalism. Yep. course. getting mass tested? No. show symptoms getting tested time infected others. Emphasis “basically”. obvious basically everyone four years ago unfit yet are. hear Trumps remark asked statement Friday? ready angry bud?

""I'll right eventually""

Let sink can't tell whether that's sensible policy, elitist. looks like City Marietta schools (a tiny school district), Cobb County schools (a huge school district). great City Marietta, Cobb County. thought way cases doubled since May quite thing. casual oberserver never thought of. trade watch markets... big ponzi pump scheme. eligible donate blood, they'll throw free antibody test right now. virus died it. That’s definition triage, can’t first say doesn’t happen give example say doesn’t count lol.

The counting US sucks means, peaks perfectly aligned means reporting super messed up. Deaths covid happen 28 days infection average, symptoms around 3-7 days. see previous peaks deaths positive tests move together, funny things happening reporting.

Look countries EU Belgium want see see country reporting &amp; testing correctly:

 see deaths lag initial spike 2 weeks here. I’d set watch warrant it.

(Sorry someone downvoted you...Ka find eventually). Texas. even read headline article commenting on? mean yeah. problem hard conceptualize take people become un-cemented ""masks work, corona hoax"". idea point, there's many people North America landmass think corona go away. love Americans convinced conspiracy, especially believe conspiracy make certain people look badly, must absolutely crazy version world like. mean, basically point every country world impacted. countries imposed lockdown, hurt economy so. believe everyone conspiracy? believe never happened news lying countries, reality everyone else going without fake virus?

Just confusing. thought it. thinking good news monday brighten week, make good point just, annoying, could avoided super harsh first time around.

No international flights, leave aussies overseas, border crossing, mandatory masks regardless case numbers.

Here’s latest case/death charts Sacramento. certainly spiking. Deaths lagging, also see elsewhere. wanna ban cars? McDonald's? Cigarettes? people? People kill people? propose do? Lock everyone cages monitor go work? 

Thanks bringing good faith argument thread. would require admit problem denying long.

Reflection admitting you’re wrong part trump ethos. I've using Chase travel cards, started policy pandemic use points groceries great. troll someone every statement 7th inning disinfecting wrong. effective leadership lot people really stupid.

Barring effective vaccine, unless 80%-90% us take upon right thing, isnt gonna end burned population killed 1 2 million US next couple years. payroll tax cut means business owners gets it. low wage worker still going get taxed his/her paychecks.

Well, I'm sure countries full idiotic Americans can't bothered easily protect others. probably actually care society. crazy notion. Yeah. Groups cohabitate definitely batched. backlog, skip testing individually say ""some infected, self isolate"". reduces backlogs, done, otherwise really testing study outbreak later. People clear quicky recovering get test results tested presymptomatic FFS. important point still know stop someone getting COVID-19 giving someone, honestly biggest deal vaccine. Also 70% people human trials experience side effects head aches fever, expected type vaccine made. Literally Frankly, almost bad Brazil first. completely AWOL. There's nothing debate. Gosh looking daily infection rates feels like that. also wonder many people undetected, people without symptoms, people ignoring mild symptoms people weren’t able get tested first came testing limited. Surely number would people need realize obesity comes deathly consequences. prove this, total unsupported speculation?

not say evidence exist. can't make case, advance idea conspiracy. two cents. 49 x 5 = 245

 Hey look, right, eventually..... revolution calling! seriously redditors acting like america place planet things cost money? line ....”and won’t defund police”? say before? heard saying “liar” . didn’t mention that, triple dick comment Well, still probably good chance getting early since 20%-30% US said get vaccine even made available them. Lockdowns don’t work Ffs. many time-sensitive issues bringing right now. Supplemented unemployment eviction protections going end less 2 weeks using time something havent even arrived at.

Guys, what’s better batch testing multiplex testing.

Currently 21 people’s samples per rtPCR run 96 well plate, since person needs 3 wells (2 viral proteins human control) plus three controls plate. 

We’re moving scheme run 93 people per plate, since multiplex test uses multiple detection channels per well. vastly increase throughput long keep extractions, avoids problems pool testing. what's happening now! worked tech company serviced fortune 400-500 companies company lied hiring back, I've applied everything sun.

And reminds second question:

why (not specifically) invent &amp; popularize words ""mansplaining"" "" (whose sole purpose shame men sin self expression) ""manspreading"" (whose sole purpose shame men sin extra items crotch women have, therefore need create extra space)?

There lot factors coming play here. seems me, ignorant American politics, everyone America wants personally blame Trump high mortality rates when, compared places metrics, ain't bad. I'm mocking trump deranged orangutan is, soes occasionally feel like everyone stubs toe blame Trump.

Hopefully states take Cuomo British route kicking elderly hospitals care homes spread more, though. seems key keeping death rate down. short clip would like see rest it. someone promised rehired recovered covid back march, told ""we never said that"", I've sent 50 applications since may, I'm fucked.

Sadly situation Florida gets worse day assumed reduced arsenic cobalt make _more_ effective? idea situation US is, countries licences produce supply vaccine population others production license perhaps facilities produce. countries queue vaccine orders waiting allocated doses countries production.

I'll wait.................. problem imagining 🤪 Belgium 21% VAT though, you’re taxed spend money (this great way make tourists want shop country!). Exactly. Without federal leadership it, there's point really trying...  entire world scientists, doctors, nurses, governments conspiring Trump? pretending Covid real?  wonder...hmmmm..... wear mask, I'm crazy Federal government mandating anything. many ppl thread would openly embracing Federal Executive Mandates Trump office? Mandatory? Fines employers allow unmasked workers? 

It done one wants Even paragraphs edited misinform. really says.

""There might million doses manufactured September: seems like remarkable underestimate, given scale what's going on,"" Adrian Hill University Oxford said, **referring manufacturing capability partner AstraZeneca.""**

""He added possible would vaccines available end year."" Yea, people much important like doctors nurses. PA too, leave loopholes may well mandatory. definition airborne contagious person could leave room, someone else could walk hours later get infected (like measles tuberculosis). know that's possible, also can't rule out. also 100% 0%, there's likely reduced chance getting infected way. Yes save trillions corporations made poor decisions money didn’t years worth expenses saved away Yeah haven’t almost states made  didn’t join reasons greatly benefited them. sure still would this.

Especially ones working 3rd world nations dealing people limited resources.. last week, Jeeps hood close properly, screwdriver hammer yelling it. Neighbor came offer help, stood watched! developing, backwards. guys well educated, per capita, state? 101 participants phase 1/2 Oxford vaccine trial, think Ebola much deadlier virus. this, effect human behavior much powerful, results aggressive selection less deadly strains. SARS-CoV-2 perceived many threat, resulting limited changes behavior. Additionally, amount asymptomatic/presymptomatic spread creates large reduction pressure would select less deadly strain. Broken windows, mean burning buildings, looting, throwing bricks? 

If upset filing insurance claims replace replaceable objects, wait hear irreversible irreplaceable damage done people politicians hope vote instead riot.

I'm advocating rioting.

I'm saying rioting works better voting objectively true. numbers give us story every day discuss numbers fake Florida fucked.

Psssst... ^it ^did ^happen. Bcells dissappear antibodies?

Dengue fever like - 5 strains variant. infected one, gain lifelong immunity it, suffer much severe disease get infected different strain.

Edit: virus mutating rate potentially increases likelihood antibodies mismatched. Rushed vaccines historically caused uh... Problems. one case.

Thanks historical failed vaccines usually wait long periods, year times, see vaccines side effects become immediately noticeable.

Sold loss already known, caused dip vaccine news today lol. Creating successful vaccine still good company regardless, better advertising possible really.  exactly ""influenza like illness"" category many trackers mean? covidexitstrategy.org

Most states, even ones were/are midst uncontrolled outbreak lowest level ILI. ILI prevalence things diagnosed specifically one type illness? make sense hospitals stressed COVID statewide ILI number low. lol behavior [is limited Can't speak them, immune suppressant take, cannot anything live virus it. Oxford vaccine that, know anyone studied complications people taking immune suppressants. Vaccines mine field people compromised immune systems.

As example, cannot take nasal version flu vaccine, around anyone past two weeks. Usually vaccines horrible birth defect. hopefully one bring effects. rules would literally restrictive prison. would harm good social development.

Which exactly there's point going back in-person schools. helping children way. Parents want (free) place send kids. Instead putting weight schools, put pressure employers government help everyone get past year.  Well remember said wear masks realize, “average American” isn’t Karen see Twitter raging wearing mask Walmart.

Claiming average American “racist” literally hurtful stereotype like calling black guy “thug” Chinese person “smart”. Holy shit, post laughably stupid. voted politicians. supported them. majority Americans didn't, gotten elected. democracy. People right vote here. majority people like way things care. compare Americans refugees. ignorant offensive people ACTUAL oppressive countries. 

The reasons politicians get elected complicated ""people voting"". There's massive amounts voter suppression US, political institutions incredibly corrupt built favor interests wealthy establishment. electoral college could flat deny electing President actually voted people. (In 2016, Trump lost popular vote election electoral college. big difference values Americans Canadians. Take healthcare example. majority Americans think healthcare basic right. healthcare system way is. Canadians do. 

Statistically, vast majority Americans favor Medicare public option. also fucking stupid generalize values 350 million people 40 million people. US healthcare system way corruption lobbying private healthcare industry. Canada universal healthcare working class movements fought it. Working class movements US heavily suppressed antagonized government. complicated ""durr Americans value healthcare"". Northern. county open Covid arrived. People coming droves. care protocols. speaking position privilege. portions population access running water. exist country. extreme poverty.

But suppose since worse poverty elsewhere, matter here? seems point saying, besides arguing semantics. like Republicans much like you. risk much. Long term impacts likely penises shrinking going back inside us. I’ve joined via kings college covid 19 app I’ve part research study wave 2. selected via app home swab. take 2 days delay get others prioritize athletes... Yeah, mean, want feel sympathy suffering others disagree ideologically. Worth pointing out, too, he's unelected governor. one picked dude lead state. He's clearly head.

He took office Greitens resigned taking naked pictures lady computer tampering. (Seems likely backroom deal resign lieu impeachment and/or prosecution.) Ah! could come anyway (for time being)... travel seems better avoided general right anyway.

Its amazing US wont follow actually worked countries instead pipe dream. Well book also rewritten King James different meaning interpretation it’s bit muddied. think issue remove ability everyone *do* anything, especially property, get lot pushback. mean, could ban rivers completely, still find idiots tubes. voted politicians. supported them. majority Americans didn't, gotten elected.

Uh, yeah, think actually understand US elections work. Previously rushed vaccines cause narcolepsy Gulianne Barre Syndrom anti vaxx definition, get flu shot every year, first line get this, track record vaccines pandemics is... Poor. virus we've never successful vaccine before.

I continue cautious, stay home much possible, watch happens test subjects. government took care citizens way illness vs. unemployment wasn’t decision families make.  know what’s positive American health? anymore Covid 19 eat buffets again!! definitely anticipate opportunities skilled labor future keep eye out. want stop covid vaccine going country needs due hatred leaders country. That’s saying, don’t try deflect. was, would already agreed.

So, try again. I'm probably going wait see everyone gets turned zombied get it. talking ventilators, hardly use anymore treat Covid 19 anyways? I'd take bit shit batshit day. briefings useless liar moron definitely something need right now, everything gonna fine. admitted form signed still called back. wasn’t able answer time, return call, that’s are. respectfully disagree.

I disrespectfully disagree. 436 dollars savings hard time paying bills is. want pull 6 months money say practical, mean practical lifestyle have.

Yes, life style living paycheck paycheck. 

Man fuck attitude. one reasons country messed is. kind footwear wear beach?! sure tell us start liking eating meat bit much stick sane northern states national parks. Let Florida little hellhole. Jfc. missed that. leaving state insane amount sudden cases, quarantine get home. responsible thing do. someone smarter clarify something here?

It seems like confident receiving two doses vaccine induce immune response body containing antibodies T-cells seem targeted Covid. 

Is thought general *likely* mean someone protected future infection - least getting serious symptoms said infection - generally immune system works, still need prove this, guarantee? 

Or link still need make? work Florida never allowed work home. Since day 1, forced report office 30 people. need job nothing do. Corporate made extremely clear working home never option hourly employees. technology. can't micromanage us refuse. They'd rather get sick. replace us pay newbies substantially less. I’m sorry expand I’m wrong? know something peer reviewed doesn’t mean it’s magically perfect? read study see need paracetamol reduce adverse effects. 

I think like scientist hypothesize adverse effects strong solely healthy population immunocompromised segment? think large group immunocompromised individuals going risk lives take vaccine speed rushed manufacture illicit need secondary medication possibly hospitalization? prefer lemon pledge, lysol, do. love passive aggressive title credit species, man. almost got suckered 4th July shit year enough started staying home 4th instead. judging I’ve heard gatherings sounds like lot family friends far ignorant I’ve expected. 

I definitely expected behavior people, see across friends family extremely disillusioned right now. weren’t issues life (and obviously “American travel ban”) I’d seriously looking leaving country. amazing many people recognize term brain drain still feel like they're experts subject.

Normalize asking questions things understand.

When country's skilled labor force depleted - implement brain gain packages attract skilled labor. states carry burden accept patients. headline news every major news outlet media, especially journalist like [**Simon needs earn money. can't help it, needs clickbait. could destroy Indian buffet right now. Saag paneer days...  Also yikes. Almost countries cowardly leaders concerned playing NWO actually taking down. pass teachers, bus drivers, custodians, etc? Mondays traditionally low reporting unusually low day AZDHS didn’t acknowledge reporting error lab. I’ve nearly given data reflective situation. numbers suggest around 100k tests queue likelihood it’s closer 120k calculating previous 7 days. lot people understand vaccines work comes vaccinating older people. human body starts responding less effectively vaccines around age 30.. response even worse people 60. actually guarantee vaccine truly protect vulnerable, likely people 30 need one shot, 60 may need even that.

This unlikely going ""one shot safe forever"" deal. 

I'd also concerned taking early version vaccine, keep hearing thought protect people year, may make difficult body respond longer lasting version later line via antibody-dependent enhancement. I'm doctor though, concern probably completely unfounded. I'm glad vaccine showing promising results, I'm hesitant long-term effects.   Yeah every single American anti mask pro trump hates Europe lol Touché Chill tell world great job doing... country descends chaos. say like moron good choice.  instead planning remote learning last 3 months, people trying convince others way forward isn't.

That's real kicker me. High school colleges certainly could remote learning. several online class great. odd people think person time nothing Link interested? Hey thanks that, reading kinda want make anything sounded way frustrated said what's happening, wish :) mean there’s plenty issues america, development science innovation isn’t one them. yes know trump dumb fuck blah blah blah, private businesses people constantly great things daily. keep quiet Trump block shipments US released please? vaccine made 'Muricans surely fit narrative fuck trump opinion matters? thought vaccines enough remaining population US 2021 cool 😑 states look way Idaho dealing it? state many positive cases reopening? 

So state governor gets brownie points state push anyway? hell making people sick killing them, don’t matter anyway. long residents boost economy going (mostly low paying ) jobs, state’s inspirational.  Nurgle cultists. submission removed because

The salad bar rise again! Oxford fucking crushed pandemic honestly could known, could prepared.

I'll prepare soon raise wages point average person even physically capable preparing. happens, drop holier thou attitude. I've looked emigrating US couple decades now. popular countries look tend education career requirements quite high. difficult qualify, especially state US schools jobs right now. wall keep us in, way around. US phase III trial slated begin August. right trial needs active outbreak - ethically intentional exposure check protection table. so, demonstrating efficacy vaccinating large number people, tracking alongside similarly large number UNvaccinated people. Evidence efficacy develop people control group develop cases; eventually able say ""look 130 people control group got corona nobody gotten vaccine group."" basically need watch large enough vaccinated population place cases WOULD develop population, ongoing health demonstrate protection.

The active outbreak, faster efficacy proven (or disproven), control group cases show faster. Places get seriously control masks distancing able show vaccine effective able say ""look unvaccinated people got vaccinate people stay healthy!"" - they'd potentially waiting around months cases pop control group. New Zealand example show whether vaccine absense virus community keeps people catching it.

Brazil, India, US, Sweden good target countries vaccine test. Florida Texas Arizona Georgia particular great places run vaccine trials ragingly widespread virus recent development is. NYC poor candidate worked towards really limiting/reducing spread today, also dramatic outbreak many control group might already caught recovered this, thus would natural immunity skews results.

IDEALLY, want vaccine control group test negative antibodies (as want ""already recovered"" people either population possible) forget prison population! cost normal healthcare! wealth inequality. could go on... done it? Small coke cans? Cmon experienced medical expert failed see potential exponential growth less 1000 cases already spreading community pandemic, that’s pretty worrying.

He also failed factor asymptomatic transmissions already mainstream news late January. Got grossed OCB kid, enjoyed buffets ever since. top notch Vegas buffets good though.  ordered test! happy found chance searching google, happy see pay pocket insurance. mild symptoms, work contact public, need safe. persistent sore throat/mild fever, tested negative strep, contact colleague test positive couple weeks ago. Americans considerate wear masks. masks rest world.

Sacrificing rest world, that’s teamwork! /s yeah SUCKS live  emphasize point: result phase I/II trial, illustrate vaccine safe produces immune response. Phase III trials still need establish effective preventing disease. good news, doubt, time tell we've hoping for. live colorado year insurance charged believe $10 flu shot. wasnt pharmacy issue since flu shot clinic office everyone paid $10. great insurance (united health) I'm sure worse. That's seriously unhealthy reaction situation. countries start schools different timings posts like like veiled antisemitic posts you-know-whos pulling strings society. They're trying drag people rabbit hole conspiracy theories cases really going hospital systems really stressed. Truth. Americans dumb shit. Interesting. seems contrary South Korean study, says kids teens aged 10-19 spread well said, kids ten less susceptible spread less least I've seen far.

Which means kindergarten grade four might okay, could disaster.

Not definitive source, also found ok cool taking ? hmmmm air as:

*No human-to-human infection*

*Masks help*

*The virus airborne* True, stating broke record 9 times month sensationalist. unnecessary point i'm sure we'll break several times. important point take away still increasing clear large outbreaks states major outbreaks initially. that’s view all. Beforehand don’t know thing works. know thing works don’t need test. 

Ok test since don’t know thing works it’s sacrifice don’t get actual vaccine. Consider situation vaccine accelerates virus there’s another mechanism kills you. still think got placebo heroes? happens that? Stay strong, San Antonians. stop looking hurricanes, we'll find fewer hurricanes! don’t think reputable source. Read scepticism tax payers paid telecoms ton money get internet.... However bad think leadership is, promise much worse. absolute awe anti-scientific policies pushed politicians. *Contagion* style, lottery draw letter alphabet. Feds could make aid package schools Melanin mostly. Yoooooo live Riverside! Lol sorry . I'm teacher Chicago. Praying remote start Sadly, I'm Georgia, jealous scientific bent Alabama governor showing mask mandate. :(  Good idea.

 RemindMe! 15 days like using reddit? It’s free run it. donate anonymously? think comment highlights difference public health private health. public health recommendation, totally valuable everyone get flu shot, even 45% effective. personal level, getting flu shot guarantee still catch flu. I'm favor vaccines, think complicated, particularly COVID vaccine. COVID pretty low mortality rate people. public health standpoint, everyone get vaccinated. personal health perspective, many healthy people feel comfortable wearing mask, careful risk infection getting new vaccine perceive rushed, especially turns 50% effective like many flu shots. part dispute Bogota Mayor Duque? read yesterday wanted aggressive shut-down did, sounds like maybe media agree her. boat owner ever called pleasurable.... Yes, same. We're perfectly happy spending endless hours together nothing. doing? they’re going around hiking outdoors it’s one thing, they’re going inside stuff idk. think would trust something coming UK way US right now. (I’m American) bunch people left Bay Area moved Boise. ones know think wants matter public safety (anti vaxxers). surprised see this. Yes I've company 10 years. I'm delivering baby tomorrow, timing honestly worse! feel like can't even enjoy baby healthy recovery I'll desperately job searching. I've honestly already started. Thank kind stranger.  Bruh without hospitals would literally hotbed disease spread. You’re foundation everyone going work Corona viruses specific branch? reported another 3,119 coronavirus cases Sunday, bringing total 91,706 cases highlighting contagion's relentless attack disease killed 34 people since Friday forced another 56 people state's hospitals, Louisiana Department Health officials people hospitals needed update covered data Saturday Sunday department nixed Saturday updates ease burden officials testing figures show increase percentage people tested positive disease, sign rise cases merely function increased testing. past seven days, 10% everyone tested COVID-19, compared 8.4% people tested positive prior week. shitty thing fall damage check it. Like... tell there's fall damage wonder happen vaccine ready. can't get people USA wear mask, wonder many vaccine, especially American made. broken clock can't even manage correct two times day lol Note: According Worldometer, Connecticut Rhode Island reported numbers today, 48 states Washington D.C have. 

Louisiana reported weekend total today since longer reporting numbers Saturday. pass collection plate? private jets Mecedes Pastors dont pay Nope opposite happened, Lombardy took time flatten curve less hit regions Would boat fit bus? Lol worry, Fed keep buying everything matter risky investment is. schools opening, definitely Teachers k-12 students  Welcome 🙏 police quit new guidelines kind police want carrying guns community. Good riddance. Covid 19 spreads real fast people keep close family alabama best hope vaccine point. Even guessing lot amount supporters want get vaccine.  Translation? Slaves. They're called slaves. ""controversial labor"". They'll still refuse because....autism chances overwhelm health care systems Oxford vaccine widely available? think we've already seen close worst COVID, get worse we've seen far certain pockets - like Florida experiencing right now. Currently, county seeing around 10-30 new cases per day entire state (PA) 604 cases yesterday. point, unless huge mistakes made governance, see county even PA could experience Florida levels COVID outbreak. governor Florida clearly extremely incompetent done basically nothing whole time. niche situations like could start seeing predicting. bad small world, otherwise would beds. Problem deniers would say crisis actors. ""answer"" everything. Well, depends quickly antibodies appear. vaccines work well elderly immunocompromised. turns case, people would rely herd immunity protect them, significant majority population would need vaccinated. Jesus Christ...people keep pointing Bright said ‘under current conditions’ three months ago. people point conditions demonstrably changed. insisting obtuse? Sorry dog. /u/designing-dutchman insensitive. /s

To honest find /r/dachshund kept scrolling hard. Best dog ever dachshund/beagle died two years ago. cancer. many similar dogs made miss her. Absolutely. enough people abiding it, though, enforcement law enforcement basically non existent, least I've heard hope find something. know pretty tough I've looking since hours got cut hell many people hiring  real focus preventing big pharma government putting price tag selling it. needs given regardless Thanks great explanation! really encouraging. allowed scream rides cuz cant really disinfect air man.  believe see it. Realistically, thinking Fall 2021. Please prove wrong. bunch dipshits. Idaho terrible state anyway filled conspiracy nut jobs, racists, religious fanatic morons. 

Not gonna give one ounce sympathy one assholes get covid19 long lasting health issues, die lose loved one it. actually source 'gut feel' long term disabilities rare?

I'm actually interested reading something argues I'm seeing elsewhere. Yes that’s specific Gross. RemindMe! 15 days thanks man.. hope take 0.16% population deaths NY use 0.2% 1.0% mortality rate CDC estimates, get anywhere 16% 80% population disease. Antibody tests put closer low end, surprise 30-40% (including asymptomatic cases).

While herd immunity levels, certainly enough significantly reduce infectious nature. I'm saying Florida well all, NY could poorly still exponential growth anymore many antibodies running around. Every day say, nothing shocks anymore. something unbelievable shocks say ok nothing shocks anymore. tomorrow comes... General tax strike needs happen America. government trying kill us all. wlse could expect corrupt oligarch? He's swamp creature. corse made swamp bigger. Another week. Another defiant church. It’s exhausting... People cheered (unironically) solid 30 seconds Trump drank glass water... literally. bar set low maybe anything 100k day good people Thanks, buddy. Let's hope wrong this. Can't wait coming cacophonies anti-vaxxers conspiracy theorists! I'd still choose available vaccine lottery. Yes, even multi-hundred-million-dollar jackpots.

(Rest comment United States perspective)

My kid running around house, fun throwing catching baseball watch old game YouTube. play tee-ball spring, could knows many kids. soccer, summer camp, family vacation, sleepovers, LAN parties. many kids missing physical social growth opportunities we've taken granted? 

There many teachers whose lives danger choosing work virus incubator classroom, going without pay. tens millions children also danger. Opening schools going lead many preventable deaths, many preventable long-term permanent medical problems.

The economy halting (I care stock market, mean individual incomes small businesses) needs stay slow fewer infections. vaccine would let get back towards normal. People could go back earning income. Evictions, residential commercial, could slowed. fear coming wave homelessness vacant storefronts.

Give billion dollars? hasten vaccine? There's question. vaccine. kid (and everyone else) opportunity live safer, saner world.   Well scary. kid gonna grow like “yo dad wtf how’d let happen lmao”. mean get point course bottom heart ... lump blood. Wonder makes people Heart  We're mantaining states autonomy throughout this, pretty unique part republic, need remember important is. would agree could see science number based suggestions federal level instead knee jerk reactions occurred throughout whole last 4 months.

I'm opposed state mandated closures, little stated support state governments businesses wish enforce mask requirements private property. state makes rule they're it. Reinforcing behavior smart businesses discouraging bad behavior would huge impact.

Human nature American individuality going continue provide push back harsh words rules, we're stubborn independent people, makes america special, also might mean bit carrot bit less stick sometimes. still asymptomatic? get away symptoms feel them? Serious question. Really disappointing see, actions affect many Thank god.  going live vaccine, worst side effects going problem (Oxford use Covid spike grafted onto virus cannot enter human cells, contain Covid genes. candidates use dead Covid virus) non-live vaccines, read one type seasonal influenza vaccine weakly linked facial nerve disorder, H1N1 vaccine linked type sleep disorder, incidences one per one million dose vaccination. Live vaccines would much riskier, possibly leading infection weakened properly, Covid dangerous enough one trying make live vaccine it, especially looks like safer options going work. True that's gonna next talking point lot people tested brings death % well. course could reported maybe little both. can't change mind try stay healthy anyways Even vaccine immunity wasn’t long lasting wouldn’t still helpful vulnerable populations hot spots break cycle transmission? Hospitals give away free ice cream

sounds delish! gimme 3-scoop combo with: 

* Red Ventilator Cake

* 'Rona Rum Raisin, and

* Cookies &amp; COVID Unfortunately, true. 

And, one reasons failing slowing uptick positive cases.
That anti-maskers mentality. Depends.

Phlebotomists wear face shields, wear masks prior epidemic. Dentists dental hygienists. guess medical job biological fluids could get face, wore face shield.  10 million uninsured Americans thats certain LOL Honolulu honour.

You blame Bill Bryson misconception cultural lexicon.  Yeah able get testing done insurance much faster usually. family used free drive thru site took us 8 days get results. Completely worthless point. Cool MRNA 7/24 call? Yep, people would rather die experience change.
To proof since WW2 things gone well West, merely thought losing job, reinventing due unforeseen circumstances, enough rather exist all.
Doesn’t really get much snowflakey that. no, means stay open. Lets see really fucked get... larger companies (Target, Kroger, Walmart) creating special position hiring security well.

With many bars closed, snap unemployed bouncers take care anti-mask types. things can't done internet. lot schooling be. understand ideal neither exposing people virus  Can't believe coronavirus numbers White House cooking books. I'm sure we'll seeing cases magically ""decreasing"" everywhere Thank you, friend. stay safe. fauci lied Karen Brigade Sunday we’re good dosage level they’re moving forward flu-like symptoms. Thank you. I'm teacher I'm terrified. No, Bermuda. Maybe Barbados also something like it, don’t know, article sad. town, sixteen-year-old running collapsed died. sure Covid related not. Devastating either way. actually used babysit much younger. country would much better shape 1% positive rate required move ""phase 2"" openings 10% positive rate automatically moved back phase 1. Yeah. Normal. 

* Family hates wants nothing me. 

* friends. 

* prospects. 

* severe social anxiety due severe childhood abuse. 

To honest... Quarantine amazing me. I've made friends online feel lonely anymore. 

***I absolutely fucking terrified cried sleep going like shit goes back normal. I'm going alone again. want quarantine end.*** 

Am bad person? wear masks US fake news countries currently significantly fewer cases?  difference prisoners committed crimes, Uighur people didn’t.

Edit: I’m saying for-profit prisons aren’t issue, I’m saying doesn’t compare genocide China currently committing Would Oxford contract mass production distribution, would sell rights entities make own? words, really hope succeed get people fast possible? That’s statistical value life, it’s “worth economy”. It’s say much people generally risk loss life higher pay similar. hasn’t truly affected upper middle class suburban white Americans. hear CEOs investment bankers dying...or entire elite private schools becoming spread centers, care. Congratulations taking one semester Constitutional law. Unfortunately got wrong case, 1A issue.

And fuck say anything couple ""right"" go infect people? Reading comprehension fucking matters.

You're obviously retarded engage further. Best luck shitty sad life journey. Look US, beijg anti science, pro religion. difference one dictatorship since Islamic revolution start going thst path. Even US numbers fake. Florida currently seeing deadliest pneumonia deaths covid, maybe actually start counting numbers properly.

Also Allah god Judeo-Christian tradition, guess means God's thst 140k deaths states.

Yoir bigotry disgusting horrible human being. Dude post bombarded pro CCP. Two accounts told watch video article information whole situation since dont understand coming from. even damning whole situation article is, alot saying isnt video all.

Either way right they're terrible. calling genocide probably what's getting downvoted 

Edit: one accounts brought attention reading state run news ticker shows bottom video occassionally theyre showing state run feeds visualize journalist's research. isnt translated, trust state run news ticker much trust news coming white house. They're also suppressing certain covid-19 data seen. can't let keep happening. CDC bypassed HHS (monitored cabinet-level) means thing could happen federal level too.

Let's let hide covid data. made petition reinstate cdc primary handler stop data suppression greatest news I've received know Trump wants infection numbers reported directly White House. think idea release vaccine going time things go back normal bit pipe dream people rude surprise. 

I think days us wearing masks, social distancing sanitizing/disinfecting far over. 

Unfortunately vaccine starts getting distributed people US government going crow it’s end pandemic it’s cure everything fine won’t be. even close. 

There’s still mass testing tracing program, estimate somewhere around 30% Americans refuse vaccine they’re idiots virus still running rampant across entire country. 

A vaccine isn’t going fix issues. virus still spreading like wildfire vaccine isn’t going miraculously stop it. Holy shit China's Gini Coefficient data reported 0.465 Dec 2019 positivity rate like close 40% today? That's NY March territory. sure I'd celebrating. I’ve always kind introvert whole thing made realize beautiful socialization is, necessary well being. 

I never take another moment granted. want hold door open strangers, want smile others without mask. want thankful small things experience again. couples spending time together, couples actually confronting differing opinions things like politics racial intolerance. willingly partaking personal risk

I sure glad one infectious diseases. 

Since personal risk, go back merry way home, asymptomatic, socially distance, absolutely zero risk putting someone else danger get close right? know anyone wants easy get fired. Unless money make (book deals, bribes, etc) offsets. think bottom. 12 days -- 2 weeks -- already clearly see Sunday July 5th bottom. [Here](http://imgur.com/gallery/sXoYfBE) pic 7 day average worldmeters. Daily deaths average 516 two weeks ago 791 now. That's 39% increase.

So honestly want know lead believe bottom? cases increase follows hospitalizations soon increase. hospitilazations increase follows deaths eventually increase, no?  Wish could show guy said visits useful months back 😂

Huh? visits useful? way get around paywall? sounds interesting. Probably Mistyped.  think doesn’t want armed protestors outside kid’s house.  Holy shit, produces T-cells too? That’s incredibly good news, GREAT work Oxford University!!!! vaccine, understand correctly, modified version SARS vaccine tweaked effective COVID-19. means that, actuality, vaccine studied many years point. irresponsibly misleading title. Shockingly so. work hospital wear simple mask eye protection every patient encounter, N95 added aerosol-generating procedure. Never ever heard anyone even suggest face shields alone adequate PPE, fact that’s article saying read it:

“Plastic face shields worn tandem face mask, say cantonal authorities.”

And yet headline clearly implies act wearing face shield increases risk infection. absurd, people going read headline alone, spread misinformation, decry “mixed messaging” actual information clarified. case aware, [egg-free flu shots expect help keep touching face much. I'm sure help prevent direct spray ending face someone coughs, sneezes sprays talk.

They're clearly going help air breathe in. *Can* kill you. side effects could worse chance. guys great. sent huge care package. also reason, ""science"" U.S. fueled ego need right call bullshit new found religion they're espousing ""science evolution ideas"". Oh really? evolution ideas bunch signed petition paper regarding effectiveness masks removed PNAS? mere weeks airborne route petition forced WHO's hand respect. Even scientist behind paper wanted retracted said something effect of, ""Jeez, point anything gets people wear masks country good thing? pedantry?""

Too many people U.S., Fauci included definitely msm, seem conveniently forget washing hands 500 times day told wear masks, countries like South Korea making safe, reasonable assumptions based things like call center outbreak. fact none 1,000+ people sharing lobby people side floor outbreak happened also contracted virus told something virus transmitted, i.e. way likely airborne happen via touching surfaces. quickly changed approach issued guidance saying dangerous environments infections offices, churches, indoor dining, public transportation, networking events. APRIL.

Meanwhile, United States coming around obvious outbreak studies available time. fact, watched many U.S. based university scientist shit studies proclaim inconclusive took nightly check CNN MSNBC. never heard actually going alternative outbreak studies MILLIONS cases U.S. Nothing Monday morning quarterbacking.

Also, outbreak studies done time, several countries, China included, concluded upwards 60% new infections happened person's home. say ""your home likely person contract virus""; no, concluded every unnecessary indoor thing people go home corona infection needs shut while.

Fast forward JULY have? least 23 states never enforced kind work home order offices places work likely source outbreak media telling us new cases magically appeared family get togethers, beach, hiking trails, graduation parties. Never, ONCE, hear anyone questioning fact outbreaks happened people may come job contracted virus. American media shows photo video beach literally every story reopening fast new outbreaks. exact WRONG messaging outbreaks rare outdoors? even show beaches outbreak happened inland! crowded office management making people wear masks insists everyone come even work remotely? bar music turned or, even worse LIVE music I've seen area. 

In UK elsewhere, strict guidance issued bars restaurants playing music loudly people project spoke one another could maintain distancing. Wtf happened kind sane, point,.totally practical messaging U.S.?

America... one side thinks hoax created make Trump look bad... side consistently let's good enemy perfect questions every single safe assumption countries made order keep numbers get rid virus within borders altogether. yup, good call. 

39% positive It’s 100000 times safer outside. don’t get coughed on. around people masks you’re good outside. said preexisting condition disregard bunker guess simple thing wear mask. can't let get hand. "" **Peruvian businessman sold oxygen low price amid pandemic despite high demand** (...)

Me: Finally good news fuck world

(...) **has died due tu Covid - 19** ""

\*existential emptiness kicks \*

why nice people go first?  many considering ripple effects “it’s safe leave house hospitals overflowing everyone dying” economy. Influenza mutates rapidly. one doesn’t. vaccine raised Spike protein. protein virus uses enter cells replicates itself. won’t know long immunity persists test it. way test deploy vaccine. Better using swim/ski goggles. governor georgia needs removed office. governor oklahoma got reality check COVID virus.

Let us hope doesnt fall ill respect life enough protect citizens. 

The feds problem. States far citizens civil war, people evolved enough stand injustices without dominant overseer soaking money stay state level.

Its high time change, way make america great change money flows.

#power state government.

#defederalize fed. Inebriated individuals lower reaction times, meaning lack cognitive ability brace impact like non-impaired individuals instinctively do. intoxicated person’s body takes path least resistance, results little injury. mom asthma covid late may much better (albeit complications). yes, death sentence.. definitely take seriously give support. Wishing family safety good health 🙏 That's great. However pretty clear live south 95 90% humidity parking lot noon. Now, could build tents AC we're something.  KD-like disease, yes. don’t think I’ve read anything definitive that.  literally said tell ask government help lazy ass won’t. else read? write article? he's kinda dangerous *ignored* ya feel me?

Once leaves White House, whether next January (God forbid) 4 years ... gonna **feel great** never give another moment's thought don't. lot life sadly possibly PTSD. need go everyday stuff help get mind things happened life. Staying home 24/7 brings back bad memories me. need fresh air. Appreciate kind words! Honestly thought 5 days hero country. Despite everything, gave us hope. Rest peace. Nah, Disneyland. thinking Disneyworld. qualified, lnow amd sttended good doctors Cuba. also kick many useful grandma gives tea checks temperature. Damn might gone time test gets done  ""Figure out"". 

Our society set way school become childcare. Makes two us. lot optional things while.

Pretty much point Grocery Store, department store (no browsing..just get list things leave), Amazon.

I've actually carry food maybe 3 times since February. would awesome. Especially total landslide. New York locked down. How'd work out? It’s M.O. long remember, caring people essential functional society. They’d rather richest player impoverished system live better lives world neighbors means ask shared power. Who’s going produce volumes would need, asking r/wallstreetbets NH Gov said same. Possibly reduced hours, split shifts, etc. said lockdown option. Though also ~25 hospitalizations currently. Where's karma people keep talking about? Remindme! 15 days Yeah, disabilities bigger issue. Younger kids also lot demanding. actually try teach kid play chess 2 year old successful “the king queen always together”. could spend lot time plushies puzzles though. yeah, need keep eye kid age make working home impossible. heard free microchip though 17s. 3500-4000rmb salary Chinese.  hard imagine? That’s literally it’s worked thousands years.

Also, said anything waltzing acting like place? good time thanks blm covid spikes around US? Cognitive bias. people smarter less stubborn others Sorta like republicans 2000 2016 offsetting karma killing voters extra non voters anti-voters. Oh well, guess get die, florida. Please keep voting republican, fucking hilarious now

rest dirt You’re kind going ethics life death don’t think anyone figured out. There’s lot grey area much life worth. Would pay $5 keep friend alive? $5,000? $5,000,000,000? opinion, one knows dollar amount is.

To me, correct everyone die. invest cancer research prevent future deaths? think it’s see cancer one day avoidable completely treatable disease, death prevented. wear seatbelts driving car? want lower chance death. believe although die one day, death COVID prevented. want live past 2020, millions Americans. Death may inevitable me, I’m gonna avoid every turn. I’m gonna play chicken death. People U.S. too. Stupid people stupid. Isnt exactly refugees though? Also Canada accepts legal immigration states. first thought joking, I'm pretty sure dick.

Edit: want give least one good reason shouldnt allowed move another country. finish school I'll 3 bachelors masters (all STEM degrees) I've never much parking ticket.is reason ""because murica bad?"". is, know become clear it'll get worse. That's want fuck out. Yeah we're hearing reports people contract virus infected recovering. infect everyone go around again. It’s also kind new vaccine. vaccine adenovirus vaccine giving army basic training entrants since 1960’s. know safe well tolerated.

So it’s oldschool vaccine wearing little Rona hat. Probably free Australia local pharmacy workplace.

It matter get money it, it, every person could helped! also remote job passport feel similarly, started become requirement order move countries (like Yellow Fever vaccine) might something would consider. something many countries hypothetically thinking vaccine comes out. pooling, strategy used community monitoring infectious diseases trachoma, not, knowledge, deployed early comprehensive screening SARS-CoV-2 United States.[2]

Strait article linked. clearly states earlier testing, pooling known used US. Maybe understand links. Thank you! know qualify, I'm social worker who's boss pandemic denier. we're taking precautions office, mask mandates within office all, we're told wear masks clients (who we're still expected see regularly) doubt many staff anyway. people work see odd one wears mask time. also drive clients around community go stores day them. absolutely terrified right now. They're even talking mandatory team building BBQ August 40+ people work attendance. nuts. ""Dont touch anything"" did. Positivity rate doubled 11% 22% last week. 

I would love optimist say finally headed right direction, data simply bear out. Measles also crazy high R0 like 14-15 makes bit realistic reach herd immunity.

Before vaccine, expected every child would get measles point. Many died. That's herd immunity. That's surviving. point herd immunity keep people would die disease ever getting first place.

The engine behind capitalism selfishness people, engine used China super competitive education money. Everyone wants best brand, best car, best school. Hard imagine fit world everyone thing again.
 
What concerning amount money China spends monitor citizens, higher budget defense. real enemy party seems inside, seem sustainable (so much wasted ressources) Impossible know. assassins leave unused, sealed bottle Novichok Salisbury need to? dark mind mind games impossible decipher ready know to.  H1N1 vaccine guide be:
- ER , ICU, critical care hospital staff first responders 
- patients severe immune deficiency, residents long term care facilities, pregnant women
- outpatient elderly, immune compromised, people significant medical comorbidities non critical care medical staff/first responders
- general population

So given 7 billion people need immunized, could take awhile unless you’re high risk group.
IIRC 3 4 months first doses H1N1 vaccine widely available. course, I’m Canada, amount money move front queue here. Can’t speak US. Brilliant get there. immune sure get stuck in! guess pray magic sky cloth every morning school doesn’t much, right? Everything political States, even brand beans buy.

Well, link backs up? point post provide evidence claim, specifically saying Moderna worse others. Fauci says we'll vaccine next year...but let get way fear mongering  wear they're close proximity orifices they're checking mouth, need bodily fluids getting (same face shields). problem argument going get people saying, ""you're always touching readjust face mask, getting virus face; wearing mask touching face first place, hence safer."" sort barrier provide sort protection, intention getting everyone wear masks. Also, doctors nurses pretend healthy avoiding sickness masks, prevent also contaminating patient. operating leg opened up, doctor still needs talk would beneficial keep opening skin sanitary possible, includes spitting it. There's also high risk permanent heart, lung, neurological damage.

Where's data supporting 'high risk'? New Zealand restrictions. People going vacation EU. US see things, also middle pandemic people spreading deadly disease. 

Sensible Americans trying fucking thread needle morons charge moron supporters everything power spread worst plague since 1918. Karen's getting double shots 5G crazies right along! 'We go blood debt. Gross. old fix news coverage Desantis great BC reopened fast aged well. Especially since testing 2 weeks behind. Absolutely despicable. Gotcha india fucked.... following perfect curve skyward.

Morto ya Wtf navy going do. Send sea lmao   Thank !!! spouse already strong relationship (25+ years) pandemic, locked together changed much, except we've gained weight much takeout.

When first started out, tiny garage apartment, highly variable income. young. Everything mattered. argued lot. we're house, stable (so far) jobs. We've learned help dark places, choose battles. mean that's rub it. never actually prevent people dying. postpone it. 

So question becomes cost benefit analysis much it'll cost stave death long. cost eleven billion dollars keep 91 year old alive, would okay tax money going towards that? upper limit cost? 

It's actually kind logic can't rev environment redline forever need last next generation. fact need say ""most likely"" still problem. seriousness... probably not. many states police allowed arrest misdemeanor crimes

Yes, contracted AstraZeneca. AstraZeneca producing vaccine mentioned OP. Well could chance choice never required fucking dumbass government led dumbass person.

If leader actually took shit seriously start. Hmmmmmmm. Go Alabama NYC tell they’re different. 

Go London rural Bamburgh, England, tell they're different.

Go Toronto Saskatchewan tell they're different.

Of course they're different nowhere near enough Europe actually entirely different languages, different currencies, different dominant religions, different laws, etc.

Teachers today would refuse work conditions century ago, good reason: think expendable. turn 20^th century, schools often required teachers single women quit fired married. usually made enough money live boarding house, much more. 


Children learning physical disabilities usually allowed school time. 


Privies outhouses still heavy use. 


Today, teachers much older average therefore susceptible getting sick.


Children learning physical disabilities right education classmates. Many children can't tolerate outside day number reasons. 


FTA: *It also possible kindergarten, first- second-grade classes could held outside...*


Bathrooms indoors now, would require extra adults shuttle children buildings winter clothes day. close contact required would dangerous, unknowingly infected teacher would close contact dozens young children daily. 


School starts month less. I'm teaching year, know several teachers taking year off, too. Unfortunately virus likely spread kill minority communities urban areas. less likely spread bumf*ck Arkansas everyone's spread (because nobody wants live digress).

It's fucking risk. can't fight enemy can't see. test see virus are.

If tested positive, inform anyone proximity, aka contact tracing. Test people isolate them.

**At nursing home Bäckgården Gnosjö, almost half rooms empty coronavirus entered. situation worst, parts staff moved accommodation protect surroundings.**

GNOSJÖ nursing homes, death never far away. rarely present Bäckgården Gnosjö spring 2020.

Of accommodation's 26 rooms people dementia, 12 vacant. Nine elderly died infected coronavirus, makes Bäckgården one country's worst affected nursing homes.

\- used losing users, lose many short time, tough. still talking difficult take in, says assistant nurse Veronica Olmos Oscarsson.

Normally, works mostly various assignments Kommunal, coronavirus discovered Bäckgården Gnosjö end March, decided help accommodation.

\- broke out, left almost assignments start working there. needed. Many staff ill necessary divide staff healthy sick.

For three weeks now, Bäckgården free coronavirus. June, four resident's assistant nurses rewarded governor sacrificing unusually drastic method stop spread infection.

Gnosjö municipality located southwest Jönköping, 10,000 inhabitants. half live urban areas. addition attention around dementia home Bäckgården, municipality stands different way corona statistics.

Of country's 290 municipalities, Gnosjö place nine highest number confirmed covid-19 cases per 10,000 inhabitants. Nearby municipalities Gislaved Jönköping also unusual number confirmed cases.

When SvD visits Gnosjö, take long meet one people tested positive covid-19.

\- like real cold, although settled lungs, sense taste sense smell. friends suffering fever nine days, says Emma Hartvigsson, shopping local Ica store.

She know Gnosjö corona falls per capita almost municipalities, believe pandemic created greater concern rest country.

\- think talk elsewhere.

Nor municipal residents meet say talk virus hit Gnosjö unusually hard.

At Bernt's patisserie, empty except truck driver Magnus Karlström. lives two half miles outside Gnosjö come buy coffee. tries extra careful wife belongs risk group.

\- children home lot school cases there. homeschooling instead. wife actually works healthcare, totally life-threatening there, away home three months.

When Swedish Health Care Inspectorate, Ivo, last week presented preliminary review elderly care's handling pandemic, Gnosjö singled one 40 municipalities hit particularly hard.

The authority received least two reports relatives residents Bäckgården, Ivo included dementia home list 90 elderly homes deemed require examination.

Haddy Dumbuya one four assistant nurses participated remarkable action situation worst Bäckgården. series positive test results residents employees accommodation, three colleagues something unusual - moved unused department nursing home.

In way , hoped able avoid spreading infection community, time streamline work isolating virus home. ten days met patients.

\- would make movie it. locked shielded outside world, says Haddy Dumbuya.

The four assistant nurses received flowers, diplomas SEK 10,000 governor efforts. despite sacrifice, infection returned accommodation June.

The staff Bäckgården thought lot caused many die accommodation virus returned. hard time finding good answers say protective equipment never ran out, bosses always supportive tried best stop infection.

One lesson infectious virus sars-cov-2 almost impossible get rid entered dementia home.

\- alarmed doors, force rooms force, says assistant nurse Dayana Fuenzalida.

\- Dementia everywhere nowhere, says Haddy Dumbuya.

During spring, many municipalities difficulty finding face masks, visors protective equipment staff elderly care. Gnosjö also noticed problem, Kristine Hästmark, moderate chairman municipal board Gnosjö, says political word associated municipality salvation: Gnosjö spirit.

\- got infected Bäckgården early. protective equipment maximum one week. chairman social committee went newspaper said shortage drew help sorts companies. grateful Gnosjö spirit, says Kristine Hästmark.

She explains various forces society helped manufacture protective equipment. Companies lent machines short-term lay staff helped. Churches sports clubs lined up.

But municipality must done something wrong accommodation hit hard infection came back?

\- think last time get homes country. long staff life outside work, always human factor ill without symptoms.

Kristine Hästmark believes fact coronavirus entered care elderly already March explanation municipality high statistics confirmed cases country's municipalities. probably also testing expanded, thinks.

David Edenvik , assistant infection control doctor Jönköping Region, also says investment tests meant Jönköping County confirmed covid-19 cases per capita country.

\- better measure spread infection many people admitted hospital look completely different. I'm worried that, says.

Gnosjöandan Gnosjö spirit usually described social system lot small business, innovation strong civil society. believe different historical conditions made factors particularly strong Gnosjö region.

Here long small-scale industrial production, free churches strong associations. Center leader Annie Lööf often talks Gnosjö spirit, comes Värnamo, together Gislaved, Gnosjö Vaggeryd part Gnosjö region. I'm assuming stay office 24/7... Even damning argument: numbers yesterday came minutes posted wrong -- Florida reported fourth highest daily case total, two day streak say. 

Rightwing media convincing people -- lying constantly data endlessly confident voices -- virus magically weakening places little contain it, people smugly post nonsense without fact checking single bit it. long term thing USA, thise money insurance. usual EU ahead US want see current map mask laws worldwide, check  anything really, going happen does. message needs blasted face day every where. actually positive. zero symptoms haven’t around anyone, really, except husband works hospital covid (his patients immunocompromised reasons). time negative. re-tested, even kids, tests negative 4 day turnaround. went next county tests. 🤷🏼‍♀️ idk means guess we’re clear now...??  I'm glad ability live bubble nothing goes wrong, ever.

There myriad ways go get things spread virus. Take example toilet starts leaking, child needs God knows drug store. simply order online, call store, explain what's up, ask place items trunk, stay car, windows up.

The health department going fix toilet flooding house everything child worthy $1000 ambulance ride ER. day delivery offered everywhere child bleeding house filling water, I'm waiting 3-5 days Amazon, especially go get need expose exactly 0 people.  lowers probability virus particle making lungs, remember stop them. That's part reason healthcare workers use n95's regular basis still getting sick. exposed continual concentrations virus still get sick. school going give concentrations regular basis unless level 4 bio suit get infected. Maybe first day first week, end first semester expect infected. wonder happen get pair seasonal flu. said wrong. situation bad countries, vast majority countries Europe consisting majority people Europe never high level pandemic, never ""full lockdowns"", small restrictive measures, never many deaths eradicated epidemic. Excluding couple exceptions situation handled little effort quickly. Several Euro countries heavier proportional losses. Ok, never put dick. Got it! Medicare all, now! yet contact tracers allowed, choose to, ask people attending protests.

Just use common sense: people gathered large groups, pandemic, spread disease.

Remember Philadelphia parade meme floating around 1918 Spanish flu? can't really help one. list countries access Netherlands growing quickly We've opened countries Europe, outside Europe still pretty strict. expect less strict future (if there's second wave). Florida still swing state... ever protect urban centers..... :/ Small Teaching Online

Context: taught lot material practical applications theory. Class sizes 200 eight. In-person classes webinars remote learning. adjunct professor graduate level. 

I simply agree premise. 

Small Teaching based kids sports. material Amazon pre-read meaningful defense extrapolating broader educational applications. entertainment value use methodology preparing crews complex multivariate assignments. days weeks deployment morning email day focuses one task, later email addressing integration tasks. 

The paper linked exercise justifying preconceptions. looks like pre-print peer-reviewed. ""If going record material anyway, issues make good be."" comparison conventional instruction. 

I'm afraid also disagree degree interactivity. Questions lecture expose material students struggle with. answer student asks later, students struggling problem benefit. unacceptable. Recordings also lose ability dynamically adjust emphasis based quiz results assignment performance. 

None objections say see place packaged material: reading, practice, video components instruction. substitute real-time instruction lecture demonstration. 

For online instruction principal performance metric drop-offs. currently work adult learners. stick end (most presentations 90 minutes) I'm well. steady stream questions throughout class engaged. 

Online definitely different in-person. Required instructor skills different. real confidence jokes. *grin* Many webinars also sold recordings side-by-side real world comparison take-up retention. Recordings good live. Simply not. 

It also experience running on-line webinar training operation lot poor instructors world. Knowing material, even expert, mean communicate knowledge others. 

I want recognize responded call footnotes. dismiss relevance change presented them. makes rare beast Internet. Please consider disagreement respectful basis. mean like death options sunshine rainbows. it’s shithole even isn’t COVID infestation. get OP asking ourselves: could happened virus high levels transmission Covid-19 Ebola symptoms death rate?

Even though Ebola could eradicated easily said, took lots sacrifices complete towns isolations achieve it. people lived living hell. people flying even peak. going across pond. England shocked government offical gets things change. Sadly. supposed breakthroughs remind every month two lab comes saying promising lead cure HIV never hear again. Honestly I'm 2 minds children if/when becomes available, childhood vaccinations kids completely understand need one, hand worry negative side effects may show short term put quickly. bullshit though. COVID uses ACE2 proteins access nasal passages and/or lungs; 

 

Children ten barely express protein 

There good reason think younger people susceptible. CDC lists website cases covid deaths literally anyone absolutely nothing Covid all, 

- _(aka cough 2 common symptoms known man, area assumed infection assumed maybe near somebody positive Covid reading [aka coughed], test required anyway)_ here's video Texas courthouse talking it, Health Department Official lays like CDC Look respective various Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports state, bureau, county, city, board, department. enough money. really trying find every single loophole avoid wearing mask. point, make masks mandatory also make wearing one crime public health. 

And enforce it. Traders going nuts raking much still make money. bottom drops, drop ways think even imagine. positive I've got, unfortunately.

And positive coronavirus test result. agree, fuck China. unleashed bloody hell WORLD. continue considered act war! Yeah, vote someone believe government, really get complain suck it. want local priest atheist, local butcher vegan. *laughs Kiwi accent

Why yes, went last weekend attending showing Back Future 1-3 next weekend, attending packed sporting event heading couple drinks dinner friends. profit=$4 vaccines.

They get keep $500 million new equipment gov R&amp;D paid though. For-profit companies charities. Ny peaked 800/day. right FL claim bad ny that's platform need delay action.

Add fact fl pretty fucking nice states implemented extreme measures masks...

The media screaming corona death!! months largely affected... Please teleport GA MT know compare grocery store school. much closer proximity grocery worker especially state Florida large number people. talking schools thousands students attendance.  look design grocery store versus school amount recirculating air much different.

As far comparing hospital school, would like point lost 600± healthcare workers coronavirus short months. Let's forget lot people wearing exceptional amounts PPE still got infected died. Many people trained proper use PPE, going class every kid takes? expect five year old able like ER nurse? going provide PPE students?

I'm pretty certain entire graduating class 2020 pissed off, put lot effort education lot money. I'm sure there's lot parents rock hard place kids schools open.  Neither things justify putting many lives risk. Don’t forget *thoughts prayers*^TM Surely forgot ... /s

Right? would anything move Germany right now. US months behind even peaked yet.

Am one sees pretty obvious peak  can't people....I work University people take seriously, dialogue blue collar workers talk “ARRRRRR GRRRR whole thing ridiculous worse flu. ""Yeah 140k dead, way flu"". then, shit not... ""Yeah test die hospital tack on.... may coronavirus, REALLY virus killed them? say covid cause death, people diabetes, heart conditions, etc, likely died that. keep saying covid killed them, actually died things. It’s virus killed them.""

It’s constant attitude fingers ears, “lalalala, can’t hear you,” mentality blows mind. matter then, it’s possibility strain virus worse flu, die, tested positive, it’s ok “the hospitals tacked died, fluff numbers.” well thrown around multiplier 10. theoretically 910,000 (or million want generous) virus.

LA population 4.2 million that's damn impressive. It’s still hoax them. Exactly, would someone mild symptoms get tested risk positive would confined? Hear hear!! searched high low rapid site Tampa. rapid tests hospital, Advent Health clinics 25 rapid tests per day... first come first serve. That’s 😑 He's genius, all, genius. manipulating public opinion exerting control around him. certain set useful skills absolutely - reframing, deflecting, placing blame, dogwhistles, derogatory nicknames, staying on-message, constant cycling distractions, gish gallop... keeps things coming. set intentional techniques using effectively. literally rose highest level power applying skill way. need remember series words, spell ""hamburger"" correctly identify pictures camels effective autocrat.

 think finally starting fail him; Covid big bear failure evident, also physical disability like glass ramp issues actually hurts image supporters way detractors think shit says does, should. care becomes angry, insults others, says kill foreigners grope women, that's strength power. looks good him, bad. care shows weakness, especially physical weakness sexual impotence. peed would really help right now. Thx. one wouldn’t expect formulation change passes P1? ones currently manufactured spec?? assume federal govt funding risk work? fact used Alaska Hawaii make initial comparison shows bias(your whole choice made sense. entire point nature Island makes easier Control COVID (which insanely obvious point, yet somehow controversial)

Hawaii permant population smaller sure. Hawaii also deal US military massive footprint constantly bringing people outside states control.

What Hawaii going Island. March April NY fleeing could go Hawaii, able head deep south. (Very) basically, Trump fumbling covid situation day 1, downplaying severity trying pin blame countries simultaneously stockpiling tests supplies federal government withholding states. huge push right (trumps base) wear masks covid hoax/fake news huge inconvenience ""personal liberties"" ; Right wing governors afraid a)go voters importantly b)stand trump, people die.

The real reason spreading among ""young people"" they're ones working low wage jobs meat packing plants, factories, shipping facilities keep families afloat. there's prisons. month so, schools. 

That's wildfire is, talking openly while, narrative shifted put blame infected rather environment engendered infection. Karma karma...? hope god Americans remember sentiment next time natural disaster strikes countries pointing fingers making stupid comments like ask help! new cases parts Canada thanks Americans coming respecting isolation policy. can't isolate, can't come. say infection actually mean infection onset symptoms? vast majority people show symptoms 1-2 weeks infection, impression fatalities occurred (barring people already death's door) 2-3 weeks onset symptoms, mistaken? consider life saver us, privatized life would awful.

#Facts: Ministry Foreign Affairs advises travel


On March 14, Ministry Foreign Affairs advised travel countries due corona pandemic. reason various restrictions things make difficult travel countries. Foreign Ministry's decision mainly motivated consequences spread infection societies freedom movement, spread infection itself.


Since pandemic began subside somewhat, travel recommendations eased various stages. following countries within EU, Ministry Foreign Affairs revoked advice, okay travel to: Andorra, Belgium, France, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Croatia, Luxembourg, Monaco, Poland, Portugal, San Marino, Spain, Germany, Hungary Vatican City State.


The advice still applies countries.

But option likely tear apart economy:

1. Total shutdown 2 weeks. Enjoy relatively virus free economy rest year beyond.

2. Keep current management let COVID loom. Economy partially open rest year, probably vaccine out.

I hope see definitely argument short term pain, long term gains. Dragging put virus cause restrictions place longer well portion population worried go spend. problem is, everyone smart I’m.... quite following number. 140K dead virus. getting 7,000 from?

Colorado made masks mandatory I’m sorry you’re going way stupid nation love last sentence. Okay, keep helping typical American throwing emotional insults instead trying identify problem. even crossed mind. Hip Hugger. lol Yeah, know. Hence heart sank days created r/Masks4All , subreddit thought would needed like month max, Trump said wearing masks. mean like heart literally sank. anti-mask shit gotten cemented way now. done that, worn mask, sold MAGA masks whatever, unimaginable much better things would been. fact I've seen 20 maga turds story tells fake. still good idea remove optional health insurance everyone global pandemic premiums deductibles higher wanted pay and/or could afford. bold new policy American education benefit amazing infrastructure, free healthcare, life-saving drugs next nothing, police force shoot sight feel like it.

The U.S. government spends per capita healthcare many European countries. get much less spend. Same.


Took 7hrs sitting car get damn test done. 9 damn days get results. close contact confirmed positive isolated regardless 9 days wait negative result infuriating.


Edit: Miami  Yes, two choices have, yes, quitting job obvious choice. But, unfortunately, work like world. 

If really simple, nobody would risk going anywhere right now. But, live. pay bills take care families. requires money, since arent getting free money, stuck best can. carries high risk getting sick, despite best efforts otherwise. Eh? Sorry I’m confused question. guess one way poverty let vulnerable low SES people die go work apparently

You really stupid asswipe wish optimism, doubt governors make right choices Trump somehow (and doubt ever will). easy. Mexico may pay wall all.  keep Americans out. I'm sorry struggling much right now, know people genuinely want get live life always wanted. able finish school bullshit. find job rat race, get locked mortgage like rest middle class. much, something.

So curious Rights taken. Good news stock price lol Ignorance learning willing to. 

Not everyone knows every thing. know, change opinion.

Ergo: ignorant.

That's reason go back time time. Hopefully. Q conspiracy people saying lie troll Deep State. Also, people defend ""But worried healthcare workers getting masks!""

If issue driving lie masks, lie tell ""Wear kind face covering helps effective N95 general public.""

You never, ever, ever tell people masks effective. sorry deal horrible situation. human cares flaw.

Half country learn it. half power preoccupied economic impact affect reelection. aware that’s felt said, I’m asking actual document read? spent twenty minutes phone lady called me. talked Ebola trial instead. 🤣 entire world going herd immunity though. don’t see results different three vaccines preceded it. good news British seem overselling accomplishments some. Hmm, have: 

- Timelines coincidentally 1-2 months US election

- Oxford Vaccine post gets huge number comments sub relative vaccine candidates

- Doubters outnumbered over-enthusiastic champions often mentioning Nobel Prizes, etc. 

- Eight Operation Warp Speed candidates chosen funding. $2 billion funding, half ($1.2 billion) went AstraZeneca/Oxford.

- strangely, since early promises Sept./Oct., precious details achieved. Instead get snippets. 

So get lion’s share funding? Could funding tied promises early delivery? 

This reminds grand promises I’ve seen large contract bids, goal getting contract rarely aligns reality. go back rosy timetable. guy fake tan hair. 

It’s hard believe Oxford would let reputation get tarnished way, anyone remember Cambridge Analytica?

Edit: say Oxford folks lot conservative PR staff. Phone tracking never succesful US. population trusting all. doubt. fought us stay virtual since hotspot (Palm Beach County). also worked board expectations teachers, parents, students start back.

We pandemic mostly control now, don’t, mobilization stay safe, keep economy going, get people back work, get kids back school sabotaged every turn administration. 

Sadly, done what’s necessary make schools safe. children lose benefits list — put families risk dying — president, administration, Republican Party generally chosen play victim refused lead. It’s fucking disgrace.  wanted see consistent attitude people literally best thing done circumstance worth, thought article worthy posted sub Ehh, kinda believe Cumfarts. asked mom brother would take vaccine became available said wouldn’t trust 🤦‍♂️ Good point, think timing therapy key. IMO, early enhancement cell function critical control virus. SARS-CoV-2 patient lost source control virus hyper-inflammatory response, DEX seems best potential therapy.

Potentially, would two rationale therapies: 1) early cell numbers / function begin decline (maybe IL7 remdesivir), 2) late, lymphocytes fail control viral load (DEX IL-6R blockade).  X fair. Even people got keep jobs got hours cut. payroll tax would help people take income home make lost.

I grabbed screenshot stomach anymore. delusional justification... begs question: life job important you?

Personally, would say life I'm someone needs income well. it. world needs still! get better. Reach friends family tell feeling. seems endless end❤ long take test positive exposure? could factor regardless Im impressed think called SARS2.0 essentially , might make people rethink nah .. Murica! member NY teacher union tell getting pressure teachers sides difficult. nah hospital , keep covid free keep elective surgeries actually make money according article, got keep bucks rolling in. 
They dumping covid patients inadequate places like hospice centers/ rehabilitation facilities. Yeah usually go Mondays part people paying attention to. Phone call goodbyes tragic, part pandemic.

What people paying attention patients treated minimally functioning facility crawling ants *while fully functional hospital* kept empty non-covid patients.

For last couple months, Red Staters pretending covid New York problem. nurses Texas worked covid facilities New York they're saying conditions Texas far worse.

Covid-19 killed people around world. reason people need die covered ants Texas. Friend, quoted stretch dozens paragraphs paper, course asking question involves specific details could asking I'd read paper fully. solid answer question, say so.

From little response provide, think claim making SARS-CoV-2 could natural event 2019 impossible human exposed closely related bat coronavirii point 7 years following RaTG13 discovery breathing heavily, despite fact numerous caves bat species live produce guano, solid evidence even one mine closed permanently following discoveries.

That seem like strong hypothesis. seems like authors started fact someone infected closely related virus, decided SARS-CoV-2 must directly descended infection, matter many surprising things happen order true.

The expression brings mind is: looking ones' keys streetlight, that's light is.

ETA: Note I'm ruling hypothesis out. I'm saying believe it, actually seems weaken lab escape theories, order believe theory need make \*huge\* assumption ability RaTG13 evolve single human infection. course making assumption, admit possibility opens many doors RaTG13 variant leak human population SARS-CoV-2. care nice u u wanna kill family ur fcker Someone work tested positive Saturday. work says talked everyone employee would interactions works find pretty hard believe could trace everyone talked last week. symptoms feel well I'm sure get test use one someone might actually need right now.

Pretty disappointed work's handling COVID since March sadly need paycheck. Everyone masked still understand need wear mouth nose. I'm tired shit. course religious folk exempt moral obligation protect neighbors, right? Usually house line constant supply. someone like SIL 3 kids elementary one middle. Oh don’t forget one barely knows turn laptop on, let alone navigate efficiently. don’t forget 9 month old either. Even stay home mom that’s impossible task. need shut fuck media approaches.

this almost every company. pandemic Remember ""flatten curve"" thing?

I hear media talking anymore. Florida: **Welcome club.** Same. one fucking cares happens USA. 

Been trying explain would get better care cheaper. propaganda sides obviously controlled oligarchss strong see scream socialism. Fuck right? Standing 50ft away plus going wrong aisles avoid people stores mask on... Happens basically every-time go store cant help mutter “fucking idiot” behind mask every-time. literally man walk store TOOK mask speak me. completely started walking backwards huge circle went checkout wait fucking leave could check out. ""rage issue""

Desperate gas-lighting tone policing. good time American.

At least agree there, probably different reasons. Given completely disconnected reality, unhinged, incapable basic reasoning Americans seem be, based responses places, America verge complete social collapse / implosion, I'm glad middle that. Hong Kong may well second outbreak. daily new cases 100, around 2,000 cases overall since January population 7.5 million, Hong Kong still literally orders magnitude better US city. thought said Extinction panic attack border also huge hassle truckers. often fairly tight window paperwork valid (sealed trailer, signed documentation, pre-processed signed ahead), well window arriving destination. Trying coordinate cross-border customs handoff time responsiblity/driver handoff would make even messier. get bridge Sarnia there's pickup driver scheduling mixup, accident caused delay either end? 

Does pickup driver handle border crossing paperwork, dropoff? would probably dropoff otherwise pickup driver trusting dropoff driver trailer right one, trying transport unknown trailer across border crossing wrong paperwork.

Finally, poor sap 100% 401 shorthaul Southern Ontario Sarnia Buffalo? fate! Paid mile stuck stop-and-go traffic 2/3 time?

Source-ish: dad longhaul maritimes to/from USA, Quebec Ontario several years. best keep patients wards isolated keep staff separate covid staff/not rotate staff way might normally. limit disallow visitors whole hospital also high risk wards. patients wear masks PPE necessary. 

I’m NJ know many nurses NYC asked experiences. Basically it’s explained, many regular floors wards turned covid wards kept floors like maternity, oncology, etc. separate normal purposes best protect patients. 

Keeping virus hospital basically impossible, especially spread bad TX right now. many sick people much uncontrolled spread. hospitals really claiming covid-free that’s disgrace.  Zombies coming government distrust time high majority take “vaccine” Reddit: ""FINALLY."" 

Twitter: ""HOW DARE CAVE IN."" want mad expectations low glad finally changed narrative mask wearing ""patriotic"". might late get kind people wear mask least better discouraging it. I'm sure results survey link cut-and-dried imply.

I'm retaining private option long there's public medicare-for-all type option well.

FTA:

""The popular option, 32 percent, consisted universal, government-operated system also would allow people buy private, supplemental insurance.""

""Twenty-six percent respondents said wanted government insurance plan offered citizens, one compel people private plans use it, system sometimes called ""public option.""

""A small minority 15 percent voters said wanted government completely remove paying health care, another 14 percent said want keep existing health care system intact.""

That's plurality support universal healthcare, majority support kind universal healthcare, retaining current system least popular opinion. sure government work, definitely able find work non-profits. Amnesty, red cross, WWF, etc. big internationals Germany - usually big cities you’ll end likely anyway. Currently job market obviously tough, legitimate hope recruiting starts end year, economy slowly recovering. Let’s see big impact looming US economy breakdown be... hub-bub rushed vaccine results, would good time remember Swine Flu vaccine fiasco 1976, half Americans vaccinated. Later, small percentage vaccinated developed long term serious side effects. 
http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v08n10.shtml 
 
The Swine Flu pandemic never happened contained immediately. irony Obama-Biden pandemic response plan anticipating Swine flu pandemic, H1N1 virus. problem oversimplifying terms realize generic labeling virus, swine flu, including Variants main version transferred animals human animal. great concern variant H1N1 expected fall may difficult contain. recent mutation H1N1 kills mostly infants elderly. existing vaccine 45% effective. 40 years development testing hundreds millions. Hypola news new vaccines eerie repeat 1976, except pandemic never materialized back then. fall, start becoming virulent existing pandemic raging. Nah that's American pharmaceuticals do. cities really shitty timing lights deliberately get cash. 

You quickly learn drive way avoid fines, certainly driving ""better"". Slamming breaks soon light turns yellow neither efficient safe driving. completely negates point yellow lights first place. Hopefully she’s custody. Sprouts mandated manager straight Karen. walks around twirling mask around removes talk customers everything. never wears mask. customer said something said since manager decide whether mandated not. southern USA giant herd immunity experiment.

What say, immense sacrifice yield useful knowledge rest world. Irrelevant. right force others anything consent to. article global economics. World markets relying US economy function, normal imports halted due covid, international economies edge.

Read article. headline guessing game. Yeah, instead isolating, maintaining basic hygiene health, US went around licking bunch doorknobs afterward. Oh dont get started shootings ;) expect rest world get relatively better ( except Brazil India). still struggling Covid going put economy back together without us playing big part. Cant wait scientists ""miraculously"" die due unknown causes... Well, morons dead yet? I’m staying locked morons hospital dead. 140,000 Americans dead. ""paranoia"". Oh, ouch. pretty harsh. describe form restricted movement? Fuck you, refusing wear mask endangers everyone around you. *your* rights. right (to health) everyone around you. Well course.. country went rant wearing masks. First world problems PP ""assumed"" nothing. provable fact Black Americans average much poorer white ones. Don’t f Dutch mafia.  good news everybody, think Florida vaccines human experimentation. data collected florida human petri dish Covid unlimited potential. create vaccine even faster take advantage horrible situation. Man, really?

This shit fucked up. know meant, he's saying ""anti-vaxxer"" feels need clarify since reddit jump throat celebrate everything. 

He's bringing great points might good idea get vaccine right away. 100% pro vaccine still, 100% sure circumstances vaccine right decision right away. 

Don't childish, damn. hugs.. b ok serious? mean data reporting daily already 2 weeks old?

And takes 14 days transmission feel symptoms. unless proactively getting tested daily because, testing feel symptoms waiting results could take month carrier. Whoa whoa whoa wait minute. Covid19 didn’t really start known beginning January. magically created vaccine 3 months time? ....  We're talking divorce we've issues seeing eye eye pandemic. leans financial side things prefer self preservation.

EMT took long time got ambulance. blocked exits mall anyone close contact got sent quarantine center. girl tested like 3 4 times throughout past month got confirmed basically asymptomatic. wonder would look like scenario happened America. whole shopping mall lockdown would upset many Karens There's scene ""Blues Brothers"" provides insight. one understand joke?...its /s people! Hmmm.. people get around, idk, November 8th, would good much would treatment like cost? one understand joke?...its /s people! Makes sense, seniors saving whole lives. money, pay more. figured paying attention think things bit dramatic right I'm surprised government made China... well kind made Russia guess... Western tourists? boarders closed non-residents since March. Golgafrinchans sent middle-class persons; telephone sanitizers, hairdressers, jingle writers, accountants, etc. words, either extremely rich, sort real work all. took Golgafrincham Ark Fleet, Ship B ('B' Ark).

Yes, seems fate dealt deserving hand rich hard-working folk planet Golgafrincham. America pays nose premiums, employer least - thing though. Um, we’ve pandemics last 100 years: LOVE recovering alcoholics assume nobody handle drinking. tons people could handle alcohol fine shit trouble now.

Dump likely fail attempt, based historic results, investors know quick buy puts get inflated crazy prices. important things hold dear. Perhaps different wheelhouse even pride praise something someone life. Remember that, try smile today. 100%. Unless overwhelming urgent need vaccine, would never ever get first generation vaccine. Urine lot trouble get caught peeing public floor apparently. signed statement they'll cover medical bills anyone come contact infect Covid-19 wearing mask, jail time die.

So phase 2? Quality article. could ask 100 Americans 99 would say Xi Jinping sole source power China. media poorly informed China means populace poorly informed. I'm gonna toss probably unnecessarily stressing people postponing asap. shitty time wedding putting people risk way really great decision. Get married, wedding later risk people celebrate Sure, good temper optimistic thinking. would also say underestimate companies wanting lose money due meeting commitment/goals, even still profit either way. really want get vaccine developed testet express mode? I'm bit cautious retrospect Pandemrix later showed cause nice side effects like narcolepsy things.

And, talking vaccine virus family never vaccines Pandemrix based known vaccines flu. one knows exactly shot immune system - cause example cause auto immune disorders long term? Normally takes 10 years make sure vaccine secure, good reason.

I'm totally pro vaccination, currently I'm unsure whether take shot not. Continuing exponential growth would very, bad. they're starting pull medical professionals, logistics even refrigerated morgue trucks states. states going experience worsening outbreak. system barely keeping together is, hard limitation ICU beds: medical personnel working double shifts, sometimes even more. They're getting fatigued, they're getting sick, they're taking care families like want.

It's unlikely keep pace rate. get *more* infections, means ICU admissions patients need isolation, mention usual medical emergencies fewer places go hospitals end converting areas isolated Covid wards. Meanwhile, infection continue spread states meaning they'll able offer less relief Florida.

The ""basically everyone"" virus oft-misunderstood herd immunity, thought around 80% SARS-CoV-2. best available information infection fatality rate, would looking around 173,000 minimum deaths state Florida - likely almost twice older population. people can't reach medical care, number goes factor 500%. mention, excess deaths *other* illnesses traumas people can't get emergency medical care. 

So get saying, particularly ""neat"". disastrous outcome needs avoided costs. state needs shut immediately save thousands lives. Trump Jr don’t think ever look forward packed space Don’t forget Texas!!! never shutting down! I'm sure even invited know everyone's really happy listen opinion anyways. Great share.  He's trying Gag someone making masks mandatory... oh irony... What? Scientists changed minds based latest available data? bastards! Knowing CCP works things, I'm sure program eliminate Uighur poverty, promote unity, reduce unemployment that, s*ome* fraction people ended next assembly line of... messing around nothing.

Kind ""forced"" labor maybe, sense Capitalism forces work... Honestly, believe whatever government does, people fucked will. 

In particular matter, dozen workers forced, among hundreds Uighur workers, behind millions masks produced, sound like serious moral crisis me. would need take 10% syringes use things. least US, Operation Warp Speed, already starting mass production tons doses readily available trials complete FDA gives emergency authorization. Dying pretty significant change. may want think deeply consequences. 

If dead hope. Tomorrow? Wait, what? preliminary 45-person trial ended weeks ago. big 30,000 person study starts 7/27.

Whats tomorrow? Still, MT 37 deaths since start pandemic. possible numbers go summer tourism, state sparsely populated, many areas incredibly insulated, much issue there. 

They still want towners wear mask, get worried. Please don’t go. matter. ❤️   always felt like Stephen king writes ""evil"" human characters unrealistically.... now. Like got selfish prick risking everyone's lives charge make money always like ""naaaaah, one would pull shit, way unrealistic"" now, God damn new...which means one earth immunity it. translates nearly 8 billion people vulnerable simultaneously. Since new also effective therapies far know. Far far fewer people susceptible flu vaccines immunity contracted past. read, viral mutations result virus becoming less infections damaging. common cold rarely results otherwise healthy people ending ventilator. also issue healthcare capacity overflowing. every hospital everywhere filled brim COVID patients, room resources sick injured patients. main concern...exponential spread infection rise hospitalizations overwhelm healthcare systems place. 

Once proven safe, effective, obtainable, absolutely mandated across globe. fact there's program make sure people stay home assume they're positive real problem US right helping bring things control again...  6 weeks, likely resemble season 1 walking dead. Season 5 it’s late September. Article said kids L.A. died reminded people one experienced syndrome died L.A. County. syndrome potentially deadly. July 15, CDC received reports 342 cases six deaths related inflammatory syndrome. them, least 99 cases two deaths New York state, according New England Journal Medicine.

Dying rare, I’m curious long term health effects are. God real huh? Gimme fucking break expect pools random... Oh wow. thought SJW's stifling speech newish thing. guess not. really wonder too... why

anybody? /s


Lets hope stories disappear... That's contact again.

It's like saying 99.9% people hit cars hit cars later hit car provides immunity hit cars. Well, also another condition, one kills you? Corona may push somebody weak heart edge, dies heart attack, corona death statistics. really think developed vaccine virus 6 months. chance. Even did, trials rushed. would absolutely interested vaccine. Thank you!

My plan everything possible make move happen comfortably works next year...and backup plan. 

“If build it, come” scenario. backup plan.

Stay strong too!  Nice health workers Students get lot us jobs require us go work, don’t choice work with. best sanitize wash hands often, wear mask, everything protect myself. tasked going work plan small enclosed area someone talking stoked bars open one went one wearing masks, ill fitting mask much protect me. talk explain irresponsible are? Yeah, didn’t know risky persona life? need shutdown behavior every way  buy beer pound coffee something? That's counterintuitive, shown true again. Really shows important people learn past basics taught Econ 101. [You want legacy What? People rightfully angry lack leadership country. reason far country cases deaths. 7+ months we're still left national plan ending hell even slowing pandemic. Donald Trump colossal failure, president, man American. lens history judge accordingly hope around long enough stare reality face time comes. gee wonder We'll probably mandating masks every cold flu season rate. Here’s “something break cycle”: (a) supply idiots completely unlimited, (b) idiot population one point reaches herd immunity, (c) hospitals fill up, people wear masks fear, lowering r0. Yeah many people see Miami wearing masks try walk six feet around you. aren’t “Florida Man” Nah, you’re pretty dumb pee floor like toddler somebody told put mask global pandemic. 🤮

I straight. Wow, wonderful hear selfish enough spread virus. fun killing relatives wedding. Yes good article consistent things I've observing since February. fact US know little China consistently brush aside China's experience fighting COVID-19 ""well they're lying numbers, measures COVID-19 worth learning from"" directly contributing death toll US. There's better way illustrate see flood new facts US ""discovering"" COVID-19 China actually warned month ago: asymptomatic spread, 	aerosolisation, convalescent blood plasma, effect male reproductive fitness, etc etc, list goes on.

(This way one main reason translate post NHC daily report, want part reduce asymmetry order save live)

I want add, language cultural barrier naturally tend create asymmetry, side actively work reinforce it. west general US particular want demonise China make useful scapegoat subversive reasons, China great wall segregated internet environment control narrative domestically.

However, asymmetry benefiting China (and China knows therefore unlikely try resolve situation, reducing asymmetry would benefit others). internet Great Wall built mind, turns inadvertently giving China enormous strategic advantage. Setting aside fact fortress internet makes China impervious internet misinformation campaign without (do see Chinese burning 5G towers saying Bill Gates plan implant tracking chips via COVID-19 vaccines?), information asymmetry powerful enough causing countries make strategic blunder China.

Look recent skirmish India China example. aggressor? won? go India's news China aggressor India clear victory right unknown large number PLA killed right? Yet look actual facts ground:

* 20 Indian soldiers, including 2 majors captain taken alive

* China effectively control 1km LoC

* Modi said national TV Chinese soldier Indian land

All fact paint opposite picture. Yet information asymmetry hear India's side story, worse Indian government might actually believe propaganda, thus ensuring continue misjudge strategic situation China foreseeable future.

It's funny Indians keep pointing China saying dishonourable they're trying cover death count. literately entire chapter Art War: ""知己知彼，百戰不殆"". course China reveal useful information. know strong enemy actually is, best win half time. even know believe propaganda lose every single time. Notawarewolf978 Yeah lets risk killing people cause didn’t follow along. reckless speculation supported science point. case vaccine probably work either ... reason think said true meaningful scale Exactly. Sticking head sand like ostrich pretending pandemic pretending economic crash/crisis going magically make things true. First off, interesting even answering argument problem infected staff, Cuomo put coronavirus patients NH claimed post.

There 14 states higher nursing home infection rates, including GA, AZ, MS LA smaller outbreaks time prepare NY. Get new right wing talking point wait four months? Bars UK opened July 4th. July 19th (15 days everyone exposed) NHS collapsed weight everyone dying yet. agree take slowdown/curve flattening granted. Things absolutely get worse again.

Cases thousand times since March means. Unless mean total good metric.

Vermont able react much better states limit outbreaks becoming much worse. curious think managed it? Oh okay. worries. agree that. still way many people way cases looking there, sounds like terrible reckless idea. cancel wait things calm down. Disclaimer: read article.

Probably available America least another 6 months. pass FDA approval well problem, best wishes family! Like said smart get hospital sooner rather later (if needed). That's biggest piece advice. thing definitely death sentence, play safe side!

Feel free DM questions support / reassurance general.

Cheers Michigan must GOP talking point, I've noticed people posting copypasta spiels central point. Getting government trace vaccinate 400 million people span 3 4 months ridiculous proposition.

I imagining working similar flu vaccinations - proactively go get vaccinated, government work us contacting us telling us so. could grossly wrong tho. count current government proactively contacting us get vaccinated considering currently running government largely thinks COVID-19 hoax anyway. crisis won’t well 2021.

Of course then. sooner start vaccinating people safely efficiently, better. put serious dent spread COVID-19 least among population vaccinations commonplace. hate living Florida. Even cops Orlando don’t pay attention mandatory mask rule.  yuuuge. Believe president ever better stock market. even countries calling say beautiful stock market 'pandemic'. That’s feel. son high risk exactly WON’T rushing get vaccinated. continue social distance, wear masks, etc., see side effects present don’t believe long-term effects either. don’t understand don’t believe something exists, manage it.

Imagine saying don’t believe cancer. Like fuck. Paywall.

Please paste article Reddit. Thanks Oof, sucks. I’m Michigan bit crush testing start, lines died significantly there’s lots drive thru testing. really hope improves guys.  sounds absurd someone Ontario, know one person board masks. Everyone either wearing masks socially distancing. Rural areas less mask use even little grocery store plexiglass weeks ago. Masks becoming mandated many regions well.  I'm American fed administration's handling virus. I'm looking first opportunity leave shithole. man! AZN calls. argue deaths lagging behind infection numbers due 2-4 week delay fact average age dropped \~10 years second peak infections. However, think US countries gotten better idea fight virus efficiently. shutdown gave us time gather necessary ppe hospital workers, understand flow people flooding hospitals, perform scientific studies treatments might work, etc. Overall, think great news hope things get better here. Arent US-american tourists almost banned around world?
Similar british folks one called ""novelty virus"" called ""a novel coronavirus"" means new. Again, clear, calling ""this novelty virus"". Even though put quotation marks around it, nobody else actually called that. you. Hope planes go US otherwise confiscate it.  American living abroad, cringe little tell people I'm from... Maybe I'll start saying I'm Canadian, eh? along 2-5 days symptoms 14 days hospitalization plus another week two death sickest patients means authorities need take action looks like it’s bad, it’s already bad don’t data due lag. yet everyone still acting way. REALLY mean is, ""I'd rather workers die keep working keep hair done, meals cooked me, dog groomed me. freedom things far important."" vote Um excuse sir [already Really, advertising-sub paid media information-channel corona?
Post open sources don’t post all. Kind wild coincidence many mask folks seem variety anti-social mental conditions. almost like insane people tuning transmission frequency sort radio TV signal. Wonder what's that? Camo mask lady keep nose covered... I'm currently living Florida exact reason. dream destination San Francisco. It’ll alright. Hang there. We’re right you. Willie’s $10 hooker Music festivals  Definitely going get it. It’s definitely reassuring read aware planned scenario then. good read. It’s still scary everything hinging successful vaccine though. reading chance vaccines going require boosters, ones every 6 months cases. knew going silver bullet fix things but, requires multi-pronged approach, apparently bare minimum much social distancing wearing mask. he/she lie about? somehow succeeds, I'm pretty sure she'll ignore proper vigour. According article already 12500 Saturday almost 12k average last week.
At point resources used testing numbers still go higher assume. I've never heard vaccines work short term. article say guarantee works longer time. able prove study done longer time period immune system occasionally ""forget""? Probably less $10. think Canada securing supply vaccine chinese company one promising ones. think starting phase 3 trials. Note article says ""Middle high schoolers"" mention elementary schoolers.

There published literature suggesting kids 10 may viral ""dead ends"" sense get Coronavirus, effective transmitting meme-vids meant go viral. Anyone easily record version. That's pretty cool. There's many support Sweden's handling. almost it. greatest event since 9/11 world. Life never same, like 9/11. telecommunications companies use price gauging revenue fund broadway infrastructure rural areas think immunity wears months would hear lot cases people catching petty opinion. insufferable people Yelp work..

Florida time opportunity learn New York's New Jersey's mistakes worked.

Florida knew resources needed long time.

Population difference alone enough say comparing Florida New Jersey fair. sure do, particular comparison made almost every single thread subreddit. time think new references, people. Wait death rates catch up, might change tune then. Lived Boise 10 years. surprised. ""Deaths down, nothing worry about. Hey, dare look back refrigerated truck. full of... ahhh... Mexican rapists deportation... assume good people."" Yeah, much Americans love scream states rights, find funny that, many ways, China's political system significantly devolved America's is. Central government limited set areas broad authority system intentionally designed push authority local level possible issues.

The list problems China central government position fix would surprise Americans. downfall again. getting started. possible convince ex go weeks kids? Get area bit, mental retreat. Sorry ex isn’t board fully moving there, glad you’re page moving needs decided together. part becomes deadly part people issues cannot helped hospitals full covid19 folks need hands have. Good luck break leg. Keep distance wear mask - care others. thought bad Dallas. We're 1,000+ day consistently. know Florida literally 10x worse. well good news next gooby election georgia even harder steal last one! Go ahead waste time signing that. anything. Protesting anything. live Democracy, literally live Oligarchy ineffective Democracy features steam valve keep people thinking protesting stuff actually anything. 

Do remember occupy walstreet? lasted long ass time shit. still vulnerable exact thing caused housing crisis, people caused crisis know get bailed again.

Black lives matter major movement year years still accomplished single damn thing.

Protesting make FEEL better. actually anything though Senators give fuck. one power gives shit.

All matters America much money have. That's primarily even regular people see judge you. Thinking otherwise poor people money, matter anyways cause money anything. USA print 360 **BILLION** dollars, let's say inflation would greatly accelerated. 

Additionally, much facts back up, I've seen. infected numbers seem rising quickly, deaths aren't, think that's virus deadly thought was. 

So, whole lot people might become infected, would die. going say stupid seems wear fave shield without mask.  explains lot people driving Texas Arizona get tests New Mexico. likely close overwhelmed neighboring states gotten top numbers. saved lives flattened curve Ohio. Ohio acted early set standard state gov do. Then, don’t know hell happened. Ohioans got mad couldn’t eat out, got outlet malls go bars, make threats protest Dr. Acton’s house. DeWine reopened early, fast refusing take action rising cases speculate lobbyist(s) DeWine.

He kind tried get cities counties institute orders first followed order counties ""red"" color coded system. county sheriff came said enforce county mask mandate (even though technically job health departments) full text mask order even came out. imagine sheriff telling people OK, really care kind order unfortunately. sarcastic, that’s **big brain** move. Combine flu season yikes. thinks you’re right I’m petrified. DeSantis~~

Hey, that’s step organ harvesting!  normal timeline would disagree say public health issue government extreme circumstance would cut insurance administer vaccine people, 2020 even though would huge trump said regards re-election, say wants cut funding testing, could see confiscating vaccine shipments, holding hostage like Ppe attempt somehow blackmail states forcing electoral voters vote him. live Texas 30 year old nurse died early on. awhile youngest death one day started reporting youngest death 40s. Apparently underlying issue blamed even though doctors said definitely Covid killed her. name taken death toll. also used report deaths day local news crew found deaths weren’t reported. started saying deaths delayed reports. earth would walking business taking piss sales floor considered Normal?  talking about, Karens always screaming. give up!

You still state denial. still get happening country? matter hefty percentage COVID patients, hospitalized not, significant aftereffects lingered months. like little cold recover from. need pass international laws this, making treatments ""open source"". 
Big pharma allowed earn 25% - 30% spending, medicine becomes open license. 

It ridiculous they, along insurance-companies, less world, drained blood sick needing. also getting billions governments help catch is, people taking seriously cancelled holidays. people think myth, simply think they're important, ones still travelling.

You're right, venn diagram ""international traveller"" ""facebook conspiracist"" leave huge cross-over. cross-over real demographic still trying travel right now. end beginning, maybe. think it’s made UK, meant coming getting it.

Brilliant. lab driver? live it’s easily 150+ degrees F dashboard day. Yes - go back past comments you’ll see link Times info comes from. reason US doses invested lot money vaccine.

I can’t speak needing two doses, impression 1 fine perhaps isn’t case. think they've already moved another gravitational mass go low enough here. Big Gretch! Trump basically said it, remember saying promised though, normally says hope, hopefully think etc., never promised Afaik.


""It go away. stay calm. go away""

""I think we're going good coronavirus. think point that's going sort disappear, hope,"" Also, completely ignored fact never successful vaccine offer solutions returning lockdown indefinitely.  wash reusable masks 5head plays stupid reason thought like instantaneous hotline something every hospital reports daily

That's Germany it, someone smart charge. theory, testing capacity increased honest, countermeasures taken virus much brutal peak reached faster and, technically gone sooner. good way deal though! still prefer flatten curve instead ignoring letting cases soar up. That's funny say Europe control. Romania estimating 1,000,000 infected September. Romania going get bad, bet ass rest EU fucked. Doesn’t belong here. politics. sub please tell downvotes changing rapidly? learned long ago karma score changes refresh try thwart cheaters.   That's what's called ""work slowdown."" Yep, I've got coffee coming, sir! minutes.... know.. sadly. Though think much political issue here, people fucking morons feels like US non third-world country struggles Corona Virus right now. Nearly every country Europe example calmed situation point daily life could go rules like wear face masks stores public transportation. happening US takes long find solution problem?
Sorry grammar mistakes english main language. Inactivated vaccines start cultured virus cells kill them, body still recognizes enough damaged cells fight virus. western countries shooting genetically engineering parts virus called subunit first route faster usually side effects. second much stronger baseline protection often requires tons time develop booster shots. seen long took Europe get control? know long would take.

Instead dont care, like always. Considering difficulty aquiring tests, time takes get result even time contagious outward symptoms: would extreme hubris assume infected time. literally gotten close proximity others buying food last 4 months know there's reasonable chance every week could gotten infected.

Edit: autocorrect one hell drug Lol, gods' work! Correction: people distrust data indicates something positive hope-inducing. literally nothing wrong incorrect Fauci said, least. Masks really protect wearer. point held opinion wearing general public, virus really wide spread enough effective. WOULD effective people started wearing masks became effective experts stated much. Oh well. scientists known general population full morons latch onto sound byte able let go given advice accordingly? Yes probably. Unfortunately scientists exactly ""people"" persons. yes, important masks got important people needed actually regularly interacted virus, rather hoarders. teacher friend mine said, “if don’t like idea going back, find another job” OMG mutate get superpowers! biggest risk moment, type people decided holiday still important (or problem simply exist), cancelled - exactly people quarantine, isolate, make effort get here.

It's we're judging Americans - we're judging ones arriving right now. self-selecting set show best. welcome explain point I'm missing. won't, course. believe already started production. wrong brother died. I'm sure. Maybe tend aware bystander effect, therefore find easier make first step.

Half battle stupid brains stupid ways thinking knowing fundamental blind spots, whether that's bystander effect, selection bias, faulty memories, etc.... Maybe aware helps people overcome them.

Or maybe people wired differently. I'm psychologist, concrete answers you, conjecture. Masks mandates unconstitutional seat belt laws. Holy shit reading like gut punch. “As SoMeOnE eUrOpE” Europe highest coronavirus death rate world. Yikes, someone's panties got little bit wadded one. Good catch. OP, academic report would preprint peer reviewed study scientific journal (eg Nature). heard Sunlight need lot time. Washing cloth masks really hot least 140 (or europe 60) boiling water soap better imo. Filter masks different, handle mine like highly infections use spray Inside (half mask), touch outside gloves... sayin... That's mind boggling! Trophy wives don’t always high IQ’s know who's idiot I'm New England, feels like living different planet. First ones experiencing it, watching rest country act flippant indifferent. we're worst hit ""new normal"" (masks everywhere, speedy testing, large percentage working home), rest country still acts flippant they're ones dieing. bizarre feeling. OP STFU. think funny now. wait. sure would use vaccine grown vero cells (epithelial cells extracted African green monkey) suppose permissive cells used atm. One blame one. There’s strategies countries places used supply chain analyzation test results. included batch testing ramping resources perform testing.

Summer Camps Bring Ominous Virus Warning Test Run Schools
Rachel Adams-HeardJuly 20, 2020, 4:00 MDT

Summer camps parts U.S. closing children counselors test positive Covid-19, troubling sign country debates whether schools start in-person instruction soon next month.

From storied sleep-away camps Missouri Arkansas city-run day programs small-town Texas, staple American summer finding it’s immune pandemic. least seven canceled sessions past four weeks, 191 children staffers testing positive.

The camps’ experience raises questions one biggest economic challenges facing country: open schools safely. Without in-person education, many parents spend substantial time energy supervising lessons.

Few officials eager charge ahead. California Friday said public schools hardest-hit counties won’t open on-campus classes virus contained, order could affect 70% populous U.S. state.

A new study South Korea could reshape school systems’ reopening plans. found people ages 10 19 likely spread Covid-19 within household younger children adults were. Children 10 spread virus lowest rate, though researchers warned could change schools reopen.

Children teens, first thought spared worst virus, also accounting rising percentage infections U.S. trend likely reflects increase ability young people get tested, well desire venture months staying home.

‘Everything Right’

It sort break Hannah Lebovits wanted two kids sent day camp Plano end June. “I thinking, ‘Well, they’re really lowest-risk group, even something came up, it’ll probably manageable,’” said Lebovits, 27, incoming assistant professor University Texas Arlington.

The first week great. second, followed Saturday July 4th, different story. First, camp alerted parents child 5- 6-year-old group tested positive Covid-19. decided test counselors. Two virus. Tuesday, 3-year-old tested positive, camp shutting down.

“They everything right,” said Lebovits. Children kept pods limit exposure. Temperature checks required. Drop-off outside, parents kept entering building. Lebovits, enrolled kids school fall, said experience changed mind feasible in-person instruction be.

“I don’t think it’s possible,” said. “They’re going end home month.”

Camp Spread

The overnight camp Kanakuk Missouri 82 campers, counselors staff test positive virus, according statement Stone County Health Department month. Camp Ozark Arkansas July 7 announced moving “closing day” due “additional, limited spread.” State officials said aware four cases, deferred full count camp, didn’t respond requests comment.

Another Illinois closed two weeks four staff members developed Covid, according KSDK television. Wichita Falls, Texas, city-run Camp Summer Fun closed employee tested positive, Times Record News reported.

The YMCA said statement immediately closed two Georgia locations learning counselor tested positive June 24. counselor passed mandatory safety protocols tested negative start camp, group said. Kanakuk didn’t respond requests comment. Chabad Plano, operated camp Lebovits children attended, didn’t immediately comment.

It’s soon say whether cases summer camps reflect rapid spread occurring communities across country -- they’re direct result transmission cabins, food halls craft rooms.

“What’s hard tell whether there’s transmission camps themselves,” said Jill Weatherhead, assistant professor infectious disease tropical medicine Baylor College Medicine Houston.

Prevention Layers

The American Camp Association, counts 3,100 facilities members, said that’s key distinction. “An outbreak definition different case two identified camp,” Tom Rosenberg, group’s chief executive officer, said interview. far, 50 camps camper staff member test positive, said. “It’s pretty small fraction.”

The ACA 10 protocols recommended summer season Rosenberg refers “layers prevention.” includes asking families “shelter place” ahead showing camp, quarantining positive cases requiring masks.

“Some experience showing us camps employed non-pharmaceutical interventions” successful, said Rosenberg. “But employ them, Mother Nature forgiving.”

Studies suggest children don’t suffer severe coronavirus symptoms often adults. show mild effects. long list unknowns remains comes infections among young. long-term effects? likely spread one -- counselors, teachers parents?

“We’re early really understand long-term implications adults, particularly children,” Weatherhead said. “You’re talking young children bodies still growing lungs still maturing.”

Hospitals Prepare

More infected kids also means children end experiencing severe symptoms. Texas Children’s Hospital Houston recently expanded Covid-19 capacity prepare increase hospitalizations among young.

“In early experience, handful patients, really last three four weeks numbers gone quite significantly,” said Lara Shekerdemian, chief critical care hospital.

“The vast majority really well,” said. “There proportion become sicker that. require life support ICU, whole spectrum.”

What’s particularly challenging cases don’t come symptoms. Children brought hospital routine procedure, appendectomy, parents learn they’re infected, said Shekerdemian.

“The biggest danger people without symptoms, go daily life,” said. “We don’t know transmission rate.”

— assistance Stephen Stapczynski civilized countries, people quarantine provided services payments compensate pandemic-fighting service they’re providing community. US, though, we’re expected rugged individualists. people quarantine don’t resources survive own, they’re supposed starve, it’s fault choosing poor. It’s always individual’s fault making bad choices, never system’s fault providing lousy choices. That’s American way. Yeah still isn’t sars vaccine, it’s bit worrisome like 20 different companies claiming vaccine covid19 it’s safe Damn fuckin waste money masters degree was. Smh. called common courtesy people. Anyone asymptomatic carrier. know did... like dope. entire world focused making vaccine.

If stars align could October/November.

Most likely next year.

Stay positive friend. many people working tirelessly you. Every time see vaccine updates resist sending ""nothing do, let covid thing"" family friends. slow things down. Great news, hopefully timeline overhyped. case either a) real b) achieved world peace thats real secret. meanwhile australia extended enhanced job seeker program pays people look work next march... thanks america! DeWine (OH) started well, backed off. We'll see county specific mandates pay off. that's case nearly every industry country. 

Positivity probably thing get people spending money thing get economy back track pointless comments add nothing debate, like first comment, waste time hence downvotes. one lying here: 

[Sweden highest daily death rate world per capita]( engaging targeted harassment. Reported harassment spreading misinformation. pay get tested? It’s mandated insurance pay testing approved physician. 7 day average new cases 1917 supposed punished UCMJ. happen actually happens two different things America. I’m driver UPS. walk several miles day brisk pace lift 10k pounds day. still breathe wearing N95 surgical mask, working extremely physical job. Stimmt ;) Florida shit show last two months help? ""I'm anti vax, I'm getting vaccinated"" ok sure whatever say. know ""how know safe"" main fucking anti-vax retoric.. keep reposting outdated videos inaccurate claims. prominent epidemiology would assert influenza cause pandemic. silly question. numbers aren’t “fake” they’re nonexistent. Can’t cases don’t test. 

As deaths, idea. don’t think there’s grand conspiracy - think it’s fucked aren’t testing us live actually give fuck virus idea what’s going on. Wait, admit ""mixing up"" results. positive cases included PCR/Rapid Screens + Antibody tests, wrong ""positive"" results, wrong ""active"" cases. Practically impossible volume trade goes through. border sees overland trade 2 countries every border world. bridge detroit windsor sees trucks entire franco-german border. would need build equivalent store management systems found harbours multiple points entry, isnt space. US could get act together... point dont know feasible. self quarantining own. people came contact last 3 weeks sister family, got sister's husband tested positive around time. Luckily symptoms mild cold like conditions. lost taste smell giving trouble. Thank much. it’s election, buy ton try take full credit. Also, thought read US already purchased 100 million doses might mistaken point. That's what's surprising far.

This America, sue anyone anything yet read much workplace lawsuits unsafe COVID working conditions.

I know loophole ""you can't prove got work"", however, preponderance evidence points getting work, reasonable case could made company liable bad management practices negligent working conditions. Huh. Well, try find it. one restricting access medical care. article states asked report go hospital. get approval go hospital - report go. doesn’t even say went. monitoring measures - anyone information need approval go I’d like see it. I’m reading seems like officials trying keep tabs sever symptoms buffoons don’t want cooperate. come illegally. even peace prize. Oxford Uni, first, would deserve it. Plus spoonful sugar 
Makes medicine go down. Unless signed early clinical trial, guinea pig. unknowns worked on, know, actual rodents Phase 1. Agree. mom would start countdown could hear slippers shuffling and....TROUBLE. damn covid. miss mom. Can't visit thinking settle down. Murica...Fuck yeah!!! say I've struggled mentally lockdown. practicing high intensity martial art 7-8 hours week. realize good regular exercise mental well being. miss socializing club working towards something people. Asking reddit republicans going get far lean heavy left. many republicans family much posted below, hint truth, accurate.

Republican's ""anti-intellectual"", ""fetus worshiping"", ""only concerned money"" people. people...with different value systems. value systems sometimes conflict people's value systems (particularly reddit).

Large swaths U.S. remote sparsely populated. can't tell number towns driven less 5,000 people. one two police officers entire town often one call help run trouble. self sufficient individuals expect rely upon state help them. lifestyle value system people populated cities understand.

Now state coming telling ""this that"" feels intrusive. bad, ignorant, malicious people, independent. weigh risk differently others see two weeks sick 1% IFR say, ""big deal"" higher chance freezing death winter get moving. 

I heard statements like ""if time...it time"" rationalization concerned COVID19. much pains me, valid viewpoint cannot fault them. fatalism oozes independence self-responsibility. character traits preserved point, ask abandon position folly.

Republican governors representatives people live also raised similar value systems. take COVID seriously, way would. &lt;/3

Find need anything week I’m sorry anyone ever thought government would anything rank corruption. It’s astounding.  work harder lol, difficult makes angry too. can't refuse work available continue collect unemployment. employer invites back refuse, report state fucked. 

Some people skirt cracks already protections place prevent everyone abusing it. Total shocker Villages increasing rate. love everyone thinks people making unemployment, like one job making 50k started. broken voluntary quarantine? left house they've done nothing sign paperwork. Echoing others said vaccine tested safe. sounds like vaccine developed quickly Covid19 around long time delivery system using developing many years. big selling point America lol. swear recruiters get us join free college/job training. faith we’ll able actually enjoy upcoming Spring :) know made chuckle *Heads book cruise* good know options, work websites, others work websites.

Honestly usually bother get news non-paywalls. hand understand journalists need money. tough situation. point RNA based virus, claim PCR could detect actively replicating false (because he's assuming humans, RNA present stage). Bullshit. He's president majority people buck measures retarded minions. 

He needs make actual effort support mask wearing make national declaration. ""leave local officials"" bullshit allowed people want entitled babies done absolutely nothing curtail it. Yep stark comparison nordics community transmission heading towards 0 0 already. totally different ball game heading fall simple mask order rest nordics really need tbh, ofc vaccine arrives... Gee... almost kids general far, FAR lower exposure so, population sample, numbers terribly accurate yet. mean, like kept schools open past March... 
and like people kept playing friends... 
and like cancelled youth gathering sports... 
and like parents isolated kids much possible...

For example, news Florida recently said 1/3 kids tested came positive. That's pretty significant except \~50,000 tests kids \~3 MILLION tests overall. Think second... 2% tests done done kids 18 make 22% total US population.

Long story, short - CLUE actual infection, symptom, fatality rate among children sample size still small. project based current sample, that's like saying Moderna vaccine provide lifetime immunity based fact created antibodies Phase 2 test subjects. Opening schools right equivalent dangerous, unethical medical study that's going carried nations youth teachers. general, fuck populist right wing authoritarian leaders? Well, decline new ICU cases would follow linear decline beginning april mid may new ICU cases mid June.  really agree lunear function best fit :p wait, worst happen wears quickly

Also chicken pox vaccine childhood you’re born mid 90s, you’ve already done Stay strong, friend. know seems like alone, not. husband also self isolating since March. We've left house less 10 times since then, initially groceries home repair supplies, we've moved strictly curbside last month. worth risk last time went inside Publix, got confrontation antimasker. extremely demoralizing see friends family living life normal, whispering ears crazy ones. could least encourage use masks rather said past, ranged anti-mask ambivalent. Big stupid dumb dumbs think god great trump god. facts lies non republican says it. Anything trump says true mongoloid fucktards eat theyre actually brain dead mud people shouldnt allowed breed breathe. pay flu shot every year paid get tested. insurance said uninsured test would cost 150. So... Yeah that's possibly important part data released today. interact lot people daily basis PA. amount people denial virus staggering. Even educated ones often surprise lack awareness pandemic. r.e.d. party bus thanks! wearing racist. Since sensible measure adopted consistently many Asian cultures, dislike masks stems racism Asians. won't/can't

Wisconsin great example ""can't"" - legislature basically stripped power governor make orders these, actually proactive leaving county/city officials individually. 90% still report symptoms months later. stories heartwarming times :) Yeah tbh think that’s exactly administration banking letting spread wild states. want saviors take credit vaccine. literally said, ""we're certainly going ask sheriffs enforce it"" press conference announcing mask mandate good news NYC I’ve noticed people day wearing masks.

I can’t speak idiots night partying - good working citizens respecting fellow neighbors tricky parse different date ranges. I'm lot 9/2018-9/2019 deaths flu season end 2018. hand 6400 figure OP 2/2020-7/2020. Hard make apples apples comparison. ‘Murica! People already dating, it’s open. know would make helpful, linking sign article lol first time I’ve seen good news articles flood subreddit. ""Unfettered Pessimists""

I'm telling David Carpenter reported saying.

He's saying earlist vaccibe ready September, that's ""by September."" Username doesnt check :) universities top 2

Debatable. I’d disagree Brit lol depends ranking use. Either way fantastic institutions UK Shocking /s. account whose two posts literally ""freekarma4u"" comes promote armed insurrection US, somehow virus control measure. Reported (subsequent comment) promoting violence. pay too? US wearing mask volatile issue. cloth face covering become hot button issue US. take much wear mask need wear mask usually 15-30 minutes time. people difficult task. work allows forced people come in? Oh yeah, Trump's also incredibly much blame can't even. CDC, WHO, &amp; Fauci could've come &amp; told people wear cloth face coverings &amp; Trump royally messing restricting N95 sales public, etc. like ACTUALLY ""wartime president"". Back chads One addendum: vaccines build upon techniques successfully used (and demonstrated safe) vaccines. reinvent wheel here. vaccine ""payload"" novel much rest re-used. US drama show rest world watches. Brazil India horror shows. Hey America, Mexicans get vaccines antivaxxers take?  side would put CA post-mask mandate exploding cases? That's good counter argument I've heard. That's totally possible. last 50 years brightest people born towns left, evangelical Christianity grew. pulpit ""education"" get high school.  Sounds like wrong. Sounds like could call ""Give X Fucking Money We're Going Cure World"" give shit b/c priorities curing world crying corner b/c someone's going make buck. Again, problem w/ you, me. Coughing tissue hand effective coughing face thong. biggest lesson learned first jury duty service (in orange county CA) never underestimate stupidity general population. truly astounded people interacted capable supporting family. I'm sure education system ever fixed... truly shame. exceed 11K! Flattening! I've never even heard Branson... Good. woulda thought pandemic would kill dogshit globalism   Billionaires first. millionaires. thousandares. hundredares. finally get mine  Good news! virus control, schools need remain closed. im sorry don’t freaking conscience. example need several doses. study showed 90% people developed neutralising antibodies one dose. ten people given two doses produced neutralising antibodies. Toronto case numbers fraction States like Florida California going we're still playing safe mandating masks enclosed spaces. Don’t forget working kitchens hospitals/nursing homes. Sometimes gets trays back peoples dentures them.  Since whole idea company limit liability, almost never answer anything. design feature. Yeah, especially Sweden's neighbors. I've noticed Danish media particular makes big point stating strategy herd immunity. like waiting even crack door run through. serious it, need prepare ready go.

I've seen many crazy things lifetime entirely shocked find deliberate. think thing careful about, though, jump wrong conclusions naturally feel compelled try making sense really bad situations. Also, want wear things probably can't change, save energy changing things - like trying focus, right now, keeping safe, making necessary preparations that's plan, helping elsewhere can/if can.

This ridiculous ADHS, pandemic can’t get us accurate timely data seem completely okay massive backlog.

How make decisions public health numbers basis current reality??? Even guy running orange peril said would veto bill hypothetically pass chambers legislature fall desk signing. Ppl try call Trump dictator, ask dictatorial things. irony finest pandemic really showing America led big corporations elected officials. Masks 100% effective. Plus lot people still get infected family/roommates/grocery store. helpful, thank you! know saw May 2021 bit? Haven’t able find specific estimate! I've working like madwoman home pretty much solely mental health reasons. sensitive knees constant balance trying work enough keep darkness bay avoiding injury straining anything. something disprove hot air? I'd ecstatic 8 year old could actually birthday party April. took cancellation party year like champ, wife help feel guilty give party year. think so, think they’re actually building machine right that’ll make ton vaccines fast (this read reddit morning don’t quote it). also read people gotten May 2021. key point disagree.

I found people careless dont take social distancing measures seriously wearing face thong. almost like say ""I wearing mask, good""

You know not. kind mask better wearing one, dont get this. Yeah. time it’s like, know you’re referring United States. know world sees us really “challenged” this. 

I easily see antivax folks fight image almost synonymous United States’ stupidity. states within US mandated masks flattening curve, despite “national numbers.” 

Just 🍊Man didn’t come make mandatory wear mask federal law, doesn’t means states aren’t already passing laws mandating it. state already passed executive order requiring masks, even outside, social distancing possible. many deaths acceptable?

Everyone opinion policy looks like. also seem seem address secondary effects policies. ok massive increase suicides lock down? increase domestic abuse? grocery stores delivery only? shelter home vaccine? essential stores like Target prohibited selling non essential items? ok massive unemployment decade economic downturn? 

It’s line easy pick 350m people.

I also don’t think total numbers great metrics. Per 10,000 people might better compare across cities, states, countries. even then, living rural area differ challenges urban. millions, billion oxford vaccine Breaking Wide isn’t credible news source, according [Media Bias/Fact Check. folks ground Arizona what's like? traffic down?

People making mandatory mask thing end greatest ideas. free. people paid unemployment entire working lives understanding lost job would taken care of.

Not agreeing $600 one thing, right opinion. saying free disingenuous. job wont even cover fraction bills, especially making less UI. complain cuz people arent willing work shit job, ignore people cant cover expenses pay. Clearly love corporate overlords dont mind exploited cheap labor. might million doses manufactured September: seems like remarkable underestimate, given scale what’s going on

So saying more? We'll get mask order inauguration we're still alive. wait months. hell trump believe that, also explain whats happening Florida? Germany masks mandatory shops since couple months plus public transportation - around 6K active cases time now. 2 people died yesterday. Total population 83M

I suspect proofs works, USA deals it. majority us didn’t vote him. minority Americans responsible catastrophe. im looking new job moment.  Florida: Naaah good. Parteeeeeeeeeeh! Thats saying man. florida locked like couple weeks even know lot people didn’t take seriously. People sat home couple hours day weeks went “okay it, society return back normal right?” deal whole school issue hundreds die day. Thanks theory. Russian money Florida, yup.

One worst things pandemic realizing horrible many people are. never knew naive really shit started hitting fan US. I'm sure many people relate. People known years, somehow never realized narcissist are. He'll yes! Please train virus clean house get sleep get well! Somebody else already responded good points, also say sometimes people can't get vaccinated... like legit medical reasons, anti-vaxx BS.

My mom works hospital Vanderbilt TN covid section rn practically room starting move departments putting others risk Dumbasses aroundd see retirement involving 1,077 people showed injection led making antibodies white blood cells fight coronavirus.

I know flu vaccines effective multiple strains influenza. also learned last week covid-19 classified least six strains overlapping divergent symptoms. 

Is Oxford vaccine geared towards particular strain covid-19, one strain, coronaviruses large? 

There's much room error something new. I'm concerned next year marked vaccines tested one strain ineffective others.

I'm worried future disease infectious enough, deadly enough, evolves quickly enough can't get top it.

Like flu killed 10x often still flu. get vaccine year still hit miss. Everyone talks covid-19 like ""after"" given makes nervous. Every Target, Walmart, Aldi Trader Joes I've South side Chicago enforcing since Gov first mandated it. Store south suburbs lot lax. take #6 bus everybody too. Yeah saw video CNN looked like block parties weekend NYC. Streets sold folks packed everywhere. 

I guess thought NYCers would smarter went idk.  Lol good luck speak myself:

Generally speaking since able finish deliverables due asked take additional responsibilities. taken responsibilities created ways streamline completed timely accurately. Thus asked - however point thing attempt create streamline work flows workers work sisters companies exhausted ability pick responsibilities facility. 

Based responsibilities listed title required rewarded (due pandemic) laid temporary two week intervals employer knows required two - three weeks. 

As along additional $600 ui available would fine - however since won’t made clear future temporary lay would “untenable” me. 

Anyway, yes, used slow time benefit employer however efficiency doesn’t seem valued. feel “slower” days able work home serve offset advisor come office things busy. 

I’m salaried employee perhaps experience would different working wage, however know plant send wage staff home need produce something - simply want curtesy extended salary workers especially workload diminished however know happen wage goes home don’t get pay - salary still gets cut. 

To conclude though simply think Time end determine value. example business eventually cut line everyone working efficiency. 

This idea efficiency equal time old notion needs die. longer true Information Age.  thought milf chaser? good scientists sharing information among themselves. There's really nothing Trump muck whole world involved. Democrats telling people wear masks back March, CDC telling everyone necessary? retirement accounts, no. far active trading, it’s hold I’ve sold everything account. Okay. saying masks reduce spread? currently states mass COVID clusters states low mask wearing rates government mandate masks like Florida.

Right -- kind feel like headline numbers overlooked here. China tested 6.5 million people 10 days. scaled up, could test entire states week enough positive batches capacity follow PCR tests. Oh god. know NC getting hit. Please safe friend. how, 

By leaders listening epidemiologists, taking advice, leading based advice. said that? First, I'm virologist even biochemist. interest software engineer used write blood bank software (for Anti-D injection scheduling). domain knowledge (very dated point, also lossy) surface antigens blood storage.

So one things always fascinated dengue managed get blood supply (differently HIV) separately managed for.

There sort discussion frankly rather junky paper r/COVID19 last couple days heme binding yada yada. I'll paste part comment here:

The thing gave [the paper] credence mind initially ~~fact~~ research [dengue replicate platelets must enough form viral replication blood blank issues dengue do.

One linked studies [this study stored blood vivo, found line particularly Compared buffer alone, infectivity DENV greatly prolonged stored PLT [platelet] RBC units. instability DENV absence cells reported previously. data show components 
within PLT RBC units promote survival DENV. either type donor cell unit inoculated, infectious virus detectable entire storage duration, whereas buffer alone complete loss infectivity 24 hours PLT storage temperature (20-24°C) 2 weeks RBC storage temperature (1-6°C).

(end pasted comment)

I honestly know there's enough cellular machinery platelets create filopodia, since fairly streamlined unnucleated, machinery RBC, i.e., organelles mitochondria.

But SARS-CoV-2 binding CD147 platelets (as hypothesized secondary, primary, site) possibly RBCs, may one route endothelium issues.  Avoidable preventing hospitals becoming overwhelmed shows recent move downward 7 day average cases?  Still 8000 tests done. Ill try remember that, pissed situation people thinking ""oh I'm sure it'll fine..."" without knowledge situation. that's problem politics, people.

Exactly. lean towards liberal policies, overall policies help fellow citizens, fuck party lines, I'll vote whoever is. Running gov sports game, people's livelihoods. monday though. I’m really hoping get one trials. Asthma I’m teacher otherwise I’m super healthy.  Covid-19 world changing event something forgotten 3-4 years It’s especially bad from. It’s one poorest places America. last sentence. sounds like you’re saying vaccine would “a long way away” phase 3. Maybe misunderstood. Good point!! Plenty classically smart people sincerely believe number retarded things. word Dixie isn’t racist face. What, difficult breather blood clots? Chemtrail reaction. hoax covid. knew chemtrails would kill one day. ass, point US surely really need volume tests yet, know fact completely overwhelmed disease citizens give shit, surely that's big problem solve mass testing good step. car insurance, even liability. 100 million? Arent 70 million people UK?

Edit: Oh, see study showed 90% people developed neutralising antibodies one dose. ten people given two doses produced neutralising antibodies.

So people might need couple doses get effective response, like measles Hepatitis B vaccine. that's plan, incredibly stupid.

The 65+ old voter, strongly favor Trump, turning him. Additionally, virus, social unrest economy creating massive wave radical young people. say radical, mean Bernie Sanders, mean IRA Bolsheviks. feeling fail act appropriately, lot republicans relying $600 would find voting democrat. take Senate leaders repulsively craven, there's motivation extend (maybe reducing it), leaving people jobless, homeless hungry middle pandemic going midterm elections good look. I'd expect something, purposes self-preservation. hits many red-state constituencies. picture hallway lined beds... that's imagery use trying tell ppl simply wear mask. hospital's full absolutely put hallway like that.

Best quote. Wish could give credit due. entirely verbatim close. ""I want hard worker. want lazy one. lazy worker get job done least amount moves. hard worker put visual effort."" No, memory serves right, younger brother previous emperor uncle current emperor. Wow. he's charge whole state? state going die stupid decisions? Feel sorry all. Every year kids die flu causes likely related schools. Source that? understanding discuss possibility amount passaging occurring naturally human lungs possible highly unlikely likely occurred experimentation. UBI provide safety net give opportunities, moving LCOL area. far better lowering minimum wage, companies always find ways work around it, making people work overtime, reducing benefits, automating away jobs, outsourcing, etc. believe marshmallow test willpower rather motivation. 

You're probably right. I'm psychologist teacher children. students usually move four legs. ""Will"" ""motivation,"" work, tend less interchangeable. lucky people born strong willpower rest need practice training strengthen it.

Ah, difference. animals stronger others animals, call innate change experience. motivation somewhat different though. giving people good reason learn something. 

That sounds familiar. Getting find lot adults say something along lines ""you need study make good living grown that's distant abstract young kids. example, daughter really like word problems fractions. work, time questioning needs boring stuff.

Know feeling. Hated math...ridiculous problems...like... going started baking together. soon measure ingredients, came together. sudden, fractions became useful difficult.

Your daughter lucky learn practical uses math early age. write better textbooks!

It’s fault local federal government completely ineffective many states. contingency, they're going try hardest US based vaccine time Oxford. dont know honest, idea israel done all. havent read much abouy israel swedish news.

One silver linings disease much funding going research now. Yeah pretty normal point saved world

lol nah Phase 4 usually optional phase. normal circumstances, Moderna mRNA vaccines could mandatory phase 4 considering new types vaccine never used humans. Oxfords 80% vaccines fairly standard need phase.

Phase 3 large number participants 

a) see works 

b) catch advise reactions

Long term vaccination issues usually picked monitoring vaccines governments. responded “human history” comment though. Nah.

I’m dead presidents represent Wait counter argument article responded to? sense mess well? haven’t saving articles read don’t particular link give you. find one post. recommend reading Oxford study results posted today (it USA Today). interested roles cells play immune system good diagrams YouTube. We’re full fuckin awake people know what’s going can’t anything prevent due greedy assholes don’t care jackasses don’t want “freedoms” taken away Sorry made think offended me, I'm mad. assume. Amazing money buys ehh Thank kind words :) OK -- disinfect entire stadium, let customers in. 

Are re-do entire disinfection procedure every minutes, customers present? 

How about, get customers wear masks month, open stadium. think says article husband forced keep working. possible wanted to. know health insurance tied ones workplace. possible carries health insurance family. think post internet. like Vegas run Ned Flanders. Airborne fact. Another point. virus right? virus mutates quickly they? every time reproduce generations virus, evolve mutate faster.


So high infected rates.... actually fighting virus strain almost half year ago? says right article still ramp 10,000 case trials. Get one masks protect him, too, occasions, FFP2 3. Eh.. guess haha. meant right midst pandemic deadly, highly contagious virus spreads like wildfire that’s even apparent normally is.

I forgot mention: working vaccine against* know targets protein used attach cells, flu changes enough year. still need occasional vaccine? There's guarantee immune system 'remember' protein forever right? I'm arguing that. thought made clear. Yes compare Sweden neighbors deaths definitely higher. Norway, Finland, etc. likely cases open, countries will. numbers currently far apart, Sweden longer worry ""spikes"" rising hospitalizations, many countries still deal this. correct answer. AZ already preparing production vaccine Cincinnati manufacturing facility. Funding provided Project Warp-speed. Maybe essential. actually disagree. 

Unfortunately flexible creative enough deliver services way protects people. want want way that's what's wrong.

And collection plate? Can't use Square PayPal shit service? Like ""hey everyone, want keep safe. Here's books. shows order pay staff utilities, much need every Sunday. help us get x amount?"" fucking hard. I'll lose $100 either buddy able get vaccine year end. 

I pessimistic made bet, feeling better I'll happy hand money over. Probably go eat celebrate! wonder got downvoted mentioning Gates, even though seem touting conspiracy think comment makes sense. upvote help out! sake humanity, yes rest country learn Northeast states? NJ example got hit hard beginning we're controlling outbreak, even two major holiday weekends cases deaths steadily dropping. Why? people wear masks. simple thing do, that's life partially normal again. 

Why rest country keep politicizing there's tangible evidence masks work? bot, look posts know, 10 thousand here, 10 thousand there, pretty soon bigly numbers. it’s correlation, amounts they’re claiming seem ridiculously Increasing average daily consumption vegetables 1 gram may cut mortality rate, according research, peer-reviewed


1 gram... that’s little. countries fisted better ate 30g day little ounce cabbage. say cucumber also helpful broccoli didn’t show impact people consume 6g day might enough. 

Basically, people don’t eat enough vegetables data correlational.

Like lettuce correlated worse outcomes.

If guess, lettuce associated fatty dressings bacon bits cheese. don’t know anyone eat plain lettuce whereas don’t know many people eat cucumbers cabbage dressing much kimchi pickles. Hmmm, maybe country, different states temporarily ""united"" common goal. It’ll likely coronaviruspreventionnetwork.org since that’s NIH uses. Yes consequence true. federal reserve perhaps largest force behind wealth inequality instability country. decades sides.

Highly leveraged zombie companies deserve bailouts. Companies blew rainy day funds stock buybacks enrich deserve bailouts. Billionaires picked bunch junk bonds? bailouts. need tear band-aid let companies fail. need let billionaires receive sowed. way climb this.

One part stable, functioning country reasonable wealth gap economic fairness. neither social unrest continue build play dangerous games. I'm word, point wealth tax probably needed done. academic report think experiencing spikes everything shut three months

I think opinion absolutely wrong refusal compare rates nations wrong too. comparison multiple nations, pretty clear nations ineffective lockdowns share patchwork, economic, non-enforcement issues prevented actual lockdown. 


I want ask state describing, hardest hit generally seem clearly reopened soon refuse apply ameliorative measures masks, respect time want waste anymore. good day.

Thats globalism is. know get results? vaccine - called ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 - developed unprecedented speed. 

ChAd vaccine beating COVID vs virgin immune system can't beat COVID sign moderna trial? I'm ready vaccine, I'll damned I'm gonna guinea pig fastest produced vaccine human history. I'm gonna hunker wait results lol Could also send poor, developing countries need, like US? agree specifically person's fault. 

But people, try looking /r/preppers , realized something possible, took action, living out. scientists warning global pandemic 10s years. Media usually put page 8.  people always saying 6 months expenses savings, start practicing backup job case goes away. usually make page 12. (or four links away read news internet.)

Again, poster getting raw deal. appreciate sympathy them.  could known, could prepared. article linked actually explains simply well:

In cell living organism, DNA molecule contains genetic information organism [5]. composed series four building blocks, whose sequence gives instructions fabricate proteins. process requires transient intermediary called messenger RNA carries genetic information cell machinery responsible protein synthesis. **As analogy, one see DNA cook book library: recipe stored cannot used. commis, chef’s assistant, first makes copy (the RNA) specific recipe brings kitchen. information ready-to-use chef, add ingredients order specified recipe create cake (the protein).**

For classical vaccine, antigen introduced body produce immune response. However, case DNA- RNA-based vaccines, antigen introduced, RNA DNA containing genetic information produce antigen. Problem says 24 hours.... mosquitoes 🦟 wait 24 hours eat? tfw bravely sign save human race end taking sugar pills  Nice straw man.

Everyone needs wearing masks, there's doubt that, black folks also commonly feel **safe** wearing masks afraid accused criminals - already happened.

(Of course, checking person's comment history absolute garbage fire, know I'm wasting time them) Vaccine USA!? 😂
FREEEDOOOMMMMM! Still requires 50%+ efficacy placebo approval FDA. That’s article says. weird capitalist healthcare system US come first. always saying shit expensive we're best innovative?!?  ""Poe's law adage Internet culture stating that, without clear indicator author's intent, impossible create parody extreme views obviously exaggerated cannot mistaken readers sincere expression views parodied."" - Wikipedia think straightforward. Children low risk whilst vaccine may extensively tested elderly (at least far). may effectively vaccinate age ranges in-between reach herd immunity reduce community transmission. came across thread COVID-19 quora. 
I tried research find anything exosomes related COVID-19, Dr Kaufman guy really said ""virus nothing toxins excreted body"". Please help debunking theory.  Yeah. Vaccinated people forced self quarantine get tested regularly article says they’re going draw test subjects US. people actually significant risk catching it. 
It profit taking.Nobody makes position time announcement.People build position closed today release data.  entire Hollywood following Tenet like schools following Harvard monk something? Swore material possession we?

Money hygiene factor. make happy, give freedom pursue things do.

Not money limits options. everywhere. got tested last Tuesday one mobile testing sites anyone get tested symptomatic not. one ever told quarantine results. post removed cannot verify reliable source. Twitter sources may reliable. possible, please re-submit link reliable source (i.e. news article).

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* That's creepy shit lol see you’re going that’s valid. Maybe publicly posted computer ranking criteria transparency sake would keep accountable. reasonable man, get case. 












-Thom Yorke Shhh, underground people. deserve vaccine much you, surface dweller! Hope happens. Please...... Well considering batshit state leadership things like this, idea they're compensating make little sense gonna ignore fact US gave Astrazenica 1 billion funds vaccine testing agreement US willg et 400 million doses fast? fair shot. US like UK priority I'm anything. themselves. democracy. choose fate. Stop acting like America North Korea. not. Hospitalization rate usually lags 1-2 weeks cases rise (people testing positive necessarily get worse right away), ICUs vents weeks months time, 1+month now? 

If breakthrough medication discovered then, may factor all, though. god, speed. Even fall through, expect see test optimistic 2021.

They've done incredible work. literally makes sense. getting 3% number? I'm definitely willing concede number lower taking number infections, can't find anything 3%.

3% still 4,950,000.

I'm crossing fingers vaccine ready well reach numbers actually start recover economy add millions chronically ill people millions already struggling get proper medical care workplace accomodations. period weeks Trump turned mini pep rallies. watch early briefings smart enough let experts talk questions raised would ask Fauci Birx come back speak behalf.


However, Trump accept short term United States going suffer quicker attack problem quicker get it. accept that. also accept Fauci Birx getting praise was.


So led Trump going television press briefings went 45 minutes sometimes two hours rambled contradicted experts. majority people see leader instead saw someone lacked control understanding. mRNA ones, even work, mean would learn lot mRNA vaccines. could really future need learn them. guess virus control help economy tested 1077 people. can't jump straight large scale risky. read full study  wasted 6 months locking 5-6 states could fuck everyone. 

States right sue states like Florida. Yes let's deal economy first. could possibly go wrong. definitely generational issue. would love visit Canada.  I’m less talking money, population control. *tin foil hat on* I’m work trip Idaho right now, got stopped [lovely ladies dune asking hell I’m wearing mask.  vaccine success Trump defeated 2021 stands chance worse year since WW2 keep joking like we're gonna f around make president like guy. Yeah federal job federal government care. Would rather train immune system receiving vaccine catching virus fight disease? guy, can't even. Expect Oct realistic distribution initial impact . Early doses given immunocompromised high risk / frontline workers. Also, good vectors (people need travel). Americans might feel entitled, actually entitled much anything. dad heard Jade Helm radio show, tried explain really thought going institutionalize him. sister never heard anything conspiracy theory, dad, blue, said ""Obama's make Christianity illegal he's going use army put Christians concentration camps, repurposed Walmarts"". tough summary conspiracy pushed lot conservative talk shows. did.  Parkman? Pinkman? Fuck killing me. it?! definitely goes ways. Alpharetta John's Creek also wealthy well, everyone itching kids back school. far looks like going back, staying home even option. DeSantis won’t shit, it’s Mayors City Coucils impose safety guidelines. American. hurts get it.

Good news Americans take vaccine anyway ""dangerous ingredients"" ""heavy metals"". worries. 

But hey someone socially distanced early (I told employer WFH notice policy) someone wears mask everywhere go even though hate much conservatards. would like vaccine. 

We're morons, far many us are.  things sad that

1) blindingly obvious getting tested, think there's chance positive, act like proven otherwise

2) blindingly obvious people morons assume 1). plainly stated EVERYONE One interesting things coronaviruses built proof-reader, mutate lot slower families virus like influenza. said, virus spread way across globe mutated hundreds different variants, called different strains clinical difference. one spike mutation caught lot attention models suggest may infectious, animal studies inconclusive experts divided whether gained prevalence due increased infectiousness random chance, agree less deadly. Current research shows antibodies generated variate works variant researchers still confident treatments/vaccines work current future mutations. want Lysol topping 🍿 ""die hole"" lmao nah, I'm living hole - I'm living life pre pandemic... one holed like fool waiting government rescue you, wanting others follow suit miss out. Could have, decided play different game instead. moment make internet public utility finally get high-speed connections country wide. nah.  Give us Anne Saccolas well we’ll think I'm high risk hospital employee state Florida.

I'm dramatic. better understanding situation do. Europe California didn't? shut gatherings, issued stay home orders, closed public parks. shut quicker comprehensively UK. Works positive rate low.... US moment almost batches test positive. need sorry, see think that. America ultimate Pay Win adventure game. dont think nearly simple. [This plot shows deaths per per population density. population density alone factor even significant factor, would expect data follow clearly defined relationship. none apparent.

[This article makes density matters home workplace: many people occupy indoor space extended periods time? Covid19 cases appear skew heavily lower incomes higher occupancy home. article well worth read think find studies role density covid spread.

Density per unit area plays role, mostly scale home rather city wide. Nah, they'll start giving reasons.

They'll pack dead people anaphylaxis category. older patient put ""dementia"". stroke heart attack deaths.

With flu season coming, they'll start packing young folks flu category, red meat ""See flu!"" folks. Interesting. Since haven’t researched this, I’m curious could actually worse catching coronavirus. realistically you’re going get it, lose dose virus worse? understand avoiding things like MMR shot chances encountering wild slim, coronavirus highly contagious. See? scrutiny scientific community Moderna squarely sights. Normally probably even know kind amateur shenanigans they're to. ok doctor. Shall call trauma? want convince others right thing don’t call idiots put down. doesn’t open communication, causes people shut down. I’ve convinced work place full people mask facts, putting down. wish people would nicer, things would accomplished happier people. also able potentially donate humanitarian efforts cover population? It’s excellent sign ordered 100m doses. getting there, people. Stay vigilant. Cases decreasing mean? I'm blaming kids, im saying people going try blame kids Modern day heroes bright news once. Maybe we're finally nearing end tunnel... 20k

Edit: read comment again. new policy PCR test anti gen gives negative. last week saw using policy around 50%(9k) PCR. assumes positives true positives curb false positives PCR tests used done cost non-profit theres less greed factor causing cut corners UK already ordered 100 million doses vaccine.

Not bad given UK's population 2/3 (66 million). Oxford vaccine uses ""a chimpanzee adenovirus (used humans don’t exposure thus pre-existing immunity it)."" one develop immunity vector virus? happens need booster Well upvote higher rated. someone overweight..this makes sad strange. realize GOP constituents able use sound reason, would Dems. compatible said, so...  dangerous side-effects taking vaccine, however, 70% people trial developed either fever headache.

So almost guaranteed headache fever, say severity side effects. Still, would rather minor side affects take full brunt Covid. 

He rough time seems pretty fit  wrong, sir. vaccine tracking one single dumbest arguments already dumb conspiracy theory. 

How exactly vaccine supposed track you? invent bunch nano GPS trackers run infinite batteries looking? reason nano bots better than, dunno, Facebook installed goddamn phone?

It would hilarious infuriating. Yay many funding grants written funding bodies? talk unfounded speculation that. Stay safe. How's PPE situation? get quality disposable masks stores? Same, I’m hoping good come this.

E.g stop turning blind eye threat industrial farming posses terms zoological diseases, tougher China, perhaps seriously recognise needs done climate change response Covid shows international cooperation get stuff done. rage inducing first glance, actually *somewhat* supported science recently. American Academy Pediatrics saying children appear catch virus all. [New research makes look much likely children catch virus, spread adults, always develop  published two days ago. Children 10 probably get infected defeat virus via cellular immune response, develop antibodes. appear defeat quickly spread it. 

The study indicates opening school children 10 would spread virus countless households, every corner society. younger children- possibly issue. good risk take, IMO, especially teachers might get sick die, science actually side kids ten low risk, getting sick transmission.

Children need face face interaction normal social development, can't interact normally re-open schools reasonably safe plan. environment constant fear extremely tight control. can't use library books, can't eat cafeterias, can't play playground might get less six feet apart. rules would literally restrictive prison. would harm good social development.

[Here's quote AAP strongly advocates policy considerations coming school year start goal students physically present school. importance in-person learning well-documented, already evidence negative impacts children school closures spring 2020. Lengthy time away school associated interruption supportive services often results social isolation, making difficult schools identify address important learning deficits well child adolescent physical sexual abuse, substance use, depression, suicidal ideation. 

*I think AAP failing consider destructive opening school rest population*, can't criticize Republicans ignoring doctors also ignore pediatricians. useless 2000 years.  We've actually ordered 190Million, 90 mill made 3 promising options. think they're trying cover bases, Oxford vaccine seems confidence Local PD actually local.

Most police officers belong communities police. They're outsiders.

Or maybe prove water wet. People seem think everyone work home. turn nose anyone actually tries speak reality. Thank god. chain work means we're almost definitely going require too. Cheers, you. Stay safe healthy! Right, also distorted view economy influence donors. Let see...if 20k people gathered sporting event LA cases covid subsequently went up, would news report? I’ll give one guess....GO We're statistics facts given article? anecdotal? Maybe missed real evidence behind article wad scrolling past adds? False headline. didnt change minds, changed said It’s major players effectively censoring certain views though. Today it’s masks. three companies mainstream media like TV decide want accept political ads favoring one party moving forward?

They're even american scientists... That's study numbers. people. Probably January 2021 I’m talking tired old argument made governors. 

They lose lose situation. People paid homes government would allowed home, right wing pundits would label story “socialist governors force recovering patients stay hospital ban homes!”

And every idiot would parrot story Even 50% reported deaths fabrications, would STILL place America 70,000 “real” COVID deaths,

And would number deaths see bad flu season. cute think done they're 18. Navy teach Texas increase covid infection rate *Both* continents horrible shape unfortunately Correct. rare occurrences. scientist start sounding alarms worry yet. However, even recovered take precautions. Mask up, glove up, eye protection, hand sanitizer wash hands. back March still take precautions leaving house returning. I'm sure are. 

Just like expert novel virus, despite personal anecdotes counter opinions Fauci actual experts. many respects less “unsure” don’t “need wait see” many articles long term Covid effects make seem.

One lung tissue replaced scar tissue, *you functional capacity previously, period.* might learn psychologically handle reduced functional capacity, might develop respiratory muscle endurance compensate. depends continued adherence rehab PT regimens achieve something person without past Covid effortlessly.

These articles need hard numbers CT-confirmed fibrosis lungs. know is, know doesn’t go away, don’t need wait see happens. visible percentage Covid patients getting lung scarring, that’s bad news. Sunday. Wait till Tuesday count. “concern” pro vaccine timelines ethical safety purposes. need know regular expectations (under non pandemic circumstances) met I’m willing get vaccinated. long that’s demonstrated, fill up!

Better done September 21st. experts telling us months likely become permanent thing, like flu. yeah he's wrong. Congratulations! teenager, posses critical thinking abilities long-term planning close half American adults. hope wherever live, given option put health first. need level-headed thinkers build better future. Ahh yes communism, communist society never failed everybody ""festering"" it, there's vaccine, genius  I’m painting anything. trust made right call information restrictions time doesn’t make “Pro-Fauci.” think probably knows better you. get don’t agree, that’s understandable. framing Falchi politician he’s it’s sort what’s odd whole backlash science right now. He’s director NIAID, nothing personally lose gain point. It’s like lied nefarious reason— stretch people wearing cloth masks first two weeks lockdown would’ve saved lives would’ve lost n95 masks ran medical community time. 

I don’t know brought democrats republicans Fauci doesn’t political affiliation that’s kind what’s insane sudden backlash.... Obviously Democrats shit right wouldn’t sundowning reality tv white house instead. never implied otherwise democrats republicans. 

When first start slamming Fauci mask advice? Right said slow spread? recently that? would like *fired up* Watergate informant instead Nixon. Actually don’t answer that. stop back forth. don’t think take repeating, “**i don’t support government officials lying public**” 5th time. I'm saying wrong. think get vaccine successfully educate majority people. even willing entertain discussion. start screaming ""sheep"" BS. 35000 worst case scenario, estimate 18k, even current covid deaths 45k, world math work that? smart thing delay schools out?

You lost non mask wearing people “the smart” Yay get alzemiers instead covid  mean essentially flu vaccine works? much money have? days get better TIL. 

Also Fuck, that's scarily plausible.

Edit: trunps antics. someone recently hospital came home minor abscess turned nothing (but afraid could MRSA), personally put high there.  Lol. solution would’ve resulted thing. sooner. Louisiana great job shutting dropping cases around 100 day. soon started phase 2 cases began spiking again. running economic impacts shut either preemptively reactively. daughters schools starts August 11 planning sending vaccines truly available oct/nov may try homeschool Christmas break. hard though. Can’t really work take care 1 year old plus teach 5 year old. Maybe could hire tutor help out. It’s quite possible would surging twice fast without sunlight. 

But likely it’s air conditioning heat extreme people indoors. Descansa en paz people thinking vaccine magic solution covid crisis heads sand. best 30-40% effective. two dose vaccine... oh need billion extra needles produced couple months. biggie. Normally icus run 70-80% capacity, ton extra room influx Covid patients

In NY need keep 30% free prepared influx Thank you. GOP lost plot. can't believe we're bickering people making money unemployment pandemic benefit-- pandemic. People spend feel like excess spend, particularly country burning ground (I'm hyperbolic, same). People scared security feels threatened. Increasing cash flow households helps people feel secure enough spend, turn keeps economy secure, etc. Would happy look something isn’t Twitter. Sincerely. invoked word “data”. truly proud countries good handle this. hope bottom heart continue set good example continue enjoy fruits labor. 

Good luck everyone.  armpit.  Thoughts prayers yo depends hotel airline refund me. booked way back befire quarantine existed. Totally disagree. floor staff immediately necessary MD likely multiple patient interactions increasing infection risk. natural.../s nothing sophomoric attempt rebuttal absolutely pathetic. Please make friends. wonder combine multiple vaccines one dose increase likelihood successfully inducing lasting immune response. realize something like cannot done vaccines completed testing trials might make interesting strategy, particularly vaccines individual doses produce limited immunity using whatever technique employed produce them, perhaps combining vaccines induce different responses could provide lasting immunity. Lmao sure. vaccine economically, politically medical rushed (because medical experts well pandemic.../s) 100% trust worthy.

I get 100% pro vaccines. again, think available December (at best) country. Still many unknowns.   How? LA locked down. We've listening audiobooks summer, comparisons Minister Magic's inability unwillingness accept Voldemort's return Trump/Southern Governors' attitude toward Cov19 eery. 

I'm TN too, going well. Unfortunately, I'm doubtful get point herd immunity. U.S. proven anything, we're god damned stupid hell full antivax idiots. mom one antivax crazies keeps saying refuses get vax out. people prevent us reaching herd immunity think. hope I'm fucking wrong, surprised thats happens. can't wait get rid Oxford Sure, here’s link. particular study found evidence enhancement, though surveillance necessary monitor future. join club, ""hermits like us""...lol...I love staying home, social life, past 5 months months normal me. first month sucked people hoarding. understand people need go out. live Canada, things tighter yesterday allowed restaurants open outdoor seating,(no indoor) closed streets could set tables street. went bike riding could see people happy, girls dolled up, probably first time months got get dressed up. Canada took slow, people lived like us, longer liked lowered numbers welcome countries. feels like usa headed toward large ""escape new york"" scenario. think another stay home order needed Trump never let happen. Trudeau Canada minority government election now, may get majority handled well. Trumps entire legacy ride happens next months, forget everything else. There’s already agreement manufacture worldwide Lonza. good thing mRNA vaccines they’re super easy manufacture compared almost every single type. .... based one general public getting covid others? I’m making everyone Walmart risk what’s point social distancing mask? Lol. CDC considers close contact anyone closer 6 feet 15 mins. I’m curious possible could antibodies prior deal was. I’m wondering it’s possible test negative covid antibodies. Meanwhile big companies getting rich selling oxigen 30-40 times normal price... killed people can't afford covid itself. Agreed. use show work sick often. much work stay home. would slow everything down. realizing mindset flawed. 

Or least since work behind desk could work home get sick. Canadian here. watching news minutes ago - Trump said U.S. one lowest death rates world; countries low death rate testing; he's expecting virus ""disappear"".

I'm heavily politics, I've never Trump. listening talk pandemic, I'm worried Americans. Left right, prayers. Herd immunity never happen today's age social media.

If shit gets really wild Florida, people actually start self regulate see social distancing masking needed month ago two months ago.  Fascinating. Obviously well good hospitals get first I'm hearing hospitals also undersupplied heck going, wonder.

I think we're halfway couple gallons sanitizer Costco case wipes got back January, I'm still interested stores still empty six months later. recent University Oxford study found evidence smartphone technology accurate measurement blood oxygen saturation. fact, study states, “oxygen saturation levels obtained technologies trusted.” Go Taxas! stupid Dems want us continue shutdown. vaccine weeks away. Full steam ahead reopenings! exactly I've doing. issue want wear mask choosing expose public little regard towards others. would hope don’t get it, let’s check comment come November. well left pony 4K shot. I'm going lose job next weeks I'm frustrated bonus unemployment ending now. PPP loans drying large wave businesses close.  wasn’t trying say don’t give shit; making point pretty much everything produced today made sweatshop. industrial meat product murder torture animals, dairy products. people “no shit” mentality mentioned: people general idea meat comes continue eat it. people know horrible conditions kids make Nike clothes shoes, they’re still bought worn proudly. It’s good educate you’re gonna really hard pressed find anything isn’t produced unsavory way without really digging paying it. ethical consumption capitalism isnt bigger news?

Why 'indiatvnews'

Shouldn't plastered BBC/CNN/Fox/MSNBC etc. 

I'm confused seems even news cycle.. People need realize sense ""suffocation"" strictly CO2 detector. detect Nitrogen, CO (carbon monoxide), LACK oxygen. Hypoxia causes different symptoms must trained detect it. One symptom loss rational thought really stupid things accelerate death. It’s scary see pessimistic people are. People right think vote whoever want. issue is, people aren’t educated vote easily moved sensationalism. Facts don’t matter, extreme anecdotal evidence supports claim things said favorite figureheads YouTube, Twitter, Radio.

If kind system would actually educate people, actual non-biased website gave rundown candidate people could trust, feel things would much better. Hence spending money marketing Mad people fighting rights aren’t getting others sick anti mask karen crew. got one well. everyone wife´s company advised get it. It´s thing tell need go ER. matter feel symptoms, oxygen level important thing.  amazing guy. I’m crying, fuck this. fair someone saved lives dies covid scammers greedy businessmen still alive despite fucking killing people profit . Thank sharing Mario’s story though, need people like him. Curious readily bringing example cyclist - nothing article indicate covid-19. exactly agenda post thing? That's tested confirmed, real number likely much higher.  massive spike total tests yesterday two weeks steady 54-55K tests. positivity rate also dropped. Seems like rule change counts something. We’ve months Hawai’i 😷 Many people report similar things swab considered normal. improved within week swab could use nasal wash (neti pot similar) settle becomes painful infection see doctor. They're already manufacturing India though they? say that? Moderna contracted lonza manufacture vaccine, Swiss company plans making US, Switzerland, singapore look man rest world gotta cut losses quarantine US time being

there's fucking way they'll close schools here, Republican ego guarantee imply people come symptoms quickly infected might actually ones better long run? people walking around even realizing bodies destroyed.

I feel like we'll reach point testing mandatory thing week actually want stop spread moat importantly monitor health. Right article:

And though yet clear caused Maxx Cheng’s death... told goal give money working class people, build new CIA HQ. Fuckin gimme hush. I'm bundle fuckin stress stuck texas work. seems hard hit corrupt areas. 

I mean, need conspiracy that. course are, since less corrupt places better job actually taking care people precautions, etc. That's nature corruption.

The thing vaccine pretty unlikely it'll ever mandatory (a) that's hard sell (b) unlike mask-wearing, putting (vaccine-using) people risk vaccinating, vaccine-refusers. I'm pretty confident people Fine want take it, long get themselves. life, all. mean gotta give cup coffee?

Even overpriced n95 $10-20 used multiple times 8 hours use, like $2.50 hour ($20/8 hours). Adrian Hill, director Oxford University’s Jenner Institute, said Oxford scientists working laboratory technical side preparation trial team hoped recruit volunteers within months.*

*“We’re hoping challenge trials end year,” said. “This might parallel might phase three trial completed. They’re competing options, they’re complementary.”* That's bad. Okay. right. Important safety tip. Thanks, Egon. Canada US 18 months+. lot smoke snake oil - pharmaceutical manufactures promise deliver. reporting ""India TV News"" also sketch. 

I understand US Department health aiming 300 million doses ready Jan 2021. - seen happening. worked government sides border 20 years know things operate. 

Let's say I'm completely lunch - hope am. Boom - 300 million doses ready Jan 1, 2021.  biggest problem US polling shown huge amount people take it. large enough slice may hit heard immunity prior virus spreading unvaccinated individuals causing million deaths.

I mean crying loud debating face masks federal government ignoring science advisors. Hopefully US government changing Jan, much put right, many wrongs correct US far behind. 

Again - best estimate may see ourselves, families friends get vaccinated late next year early 2022.  also evidence say specifically PCR test *too* sensitive. 

From Beda Stadler, former director Institute Immunology University Bern, biologist professor emeritus, [piece reprinted Swiss medium.com crux virus debris registered overly sensitive test therefore came back “positive”. **It likely large number daily reported infection numbers purely due viral debris.** [emphasis original article] Get together construction workers, police, leather clad gay bikers Indians P-A-R-T-Y!!! ... Like 2019!!!! .... earth about? weird all.

I've lived Canada US.

In Canada, Canada three (major) parties, people ""If enemy loves something, hate it, enemy hates something, love it.""

But see lot America. studies show tell someone plan (ie. helping veterans find work back home). moment tell party one proposing it, instantly dropped 13-14% support. yes works 'both sides'.

Masks inherently political America, EVERYTHING political America. notice masks seems obviously positive global pandemic. Circlejerks America First!
Have already applied spot Guinness Book World Records, certainly deserve spot.
/s ape typewriter. hard think make syringe? aren’t made unicorn blood. feel like president cares money getting economy back up, doesn’t care many lives lost process doesn’t directly effect close ones dude sucks bad. child didn’t obesity diabetes. 

It something much serious What's purpose this? Convince people wear mask? mom supposed surgery tomorrow canceled. carotid artery 80% blocked what? like working opened? Makes feel depressed, dog died early year. too. wonder China really like right now- especially they’re testing rate are. 

I’m sports fan I’m seeing athletes sports testing positive returning teams. They’re asymptomatic. say symptoms. 
I think wife February never symptom. sick, felt better got worse like Covid timeline kept thing. cold. lucky ones? Yes! they’re many like us. bet tested everyone 90% completely fine.

I feel like I’m going forced get vaccine go back work travel domestically. shouldn’t be. virus won’t kill me. Dang! hear ya, pandemic fatigue real. thought safe maybe go day trip, nope. Cases spiking like crazy area.

Anyways, thanks respectful others staying home. Stay safe healthy. He's insane, well maybe, mostly he's troll trying destabilize conversation.

Don't feed troll. Specifically pandemic, think concern. 

But general, rising wages bottom would lead increased wages upper levels well, else people would leave difficult jobs entry level ones could get paid require less commitment. 

Also honestly wages always raise expertise obvious way. lot careers require significant money effort get into, get paid horribly- think helping fields, social fields, education fields. 

Wages risen properly inflation. Money found. profits moved elsewhere prices thing continue rise wages risen rate. wealth inequality country growing. article PewResearch may helpful. 

At point also increase wages top, get upper %s. Fuck it. Let flock cull itself. What's background subject Keith? focus hockey? They've gone way narrative

What kind crazy upvoted post this? American philosophy philosophy stupid general. way thinking currently dangerous well grouping Americans one way thinking. Everywhere world idiots greedy assholes difference right government completely corrupt fucking opinions weak minded. kinda love it

(The picture) Serious question: hundreds millions people potentially vaccinated - known side effects? Especially long term ones. Ok. Available relative. UK...to medical professionals...to high risk....first. 

It’ll 6+ months gets local cvs pharmacy. install medical equipment east coast. I’ve rural areas Florida icu beds. small-medium 8-12 icu beds. Larger ones multiple ICUs 12 beds each. heart recovery units w easily converted ICU. 

And thing remember people Covid patients. still normal heart issues, accidents, shootings, etc. ICUs almost full normal day. Actually argument wasn’t even money them. talking number people can’t pay rent, buy groceries, etc. alternative. feel government isn’t capable bailing us out. think already there. numbers coming tests almost week ago? believe many politicians I’ll draw line trump , one convince he’s closet genius 99.9% contract virus reinfected. evidence anecdotal. Lol brand? safety goggles I’ve found openings let air in, don’t want get swimming goggles wear glasses.   course know Oxford U.S obviously helped lot. implying don’t deserve jobs? racism lol data many “for Covid” vs “with Covid”.

Yes.  what's death toll COVID again? Nah. moment Trump announces vaccine it. day vaccinations start start trumpeting ""Pandemic's OVER! Go back work bars Disney schools bingo Wafflehouse ASAP!"" already see anti vaxxers 100 million.

[^(Send ^(|) [^(Github - ^(|) [^(Github - Chrome I’m tired living shithole red neck state. fair, we're psych facility. strong nursing staff contract APRN anything strictly medical. quick speak regarding facilities MDs constant need. site (data couple days old) seems show percentage beds occupied covid causes, still seems majority beds taken causes. i've read though, number people need beds exceeds beds available, becomes crisis status. gets ugly. triage happening, expected life goes effect. older, single, kids, *fucked.* handy, goes something like children first, mothers expectant mothers, care givers, emergency workers, 60 things would make survival less likely. 

  Time cocoon 3-4 months really significant issues don’t let downplay them. haven’t rough you. Luckily job deemed essential employment didn’t stop. I’ve already graduated haven’t worried education I’ve still able maintain social relationships. I’m sorry you’ve experienced bad times pandemic. top that, I’m introverted enjoy time myself. Hopefully power figure financial situation soon. also hope everything open back vaccines ready soon. pandemic really eye opening society functions. safe DM ever want vent! lottery could buy private island, pay everyone take 2 week vacation long agree isolate paradise, throw huge beach wedding. would choose billion dollars incredibly fast. think understand much could family world billion dollars. could probably save lives kind money corona kill. you, U.S., even called ""good, fact based"" news sources absolutely awful.

Let's start fact almost every single article new outbreaks accompanied photo people beach. First off, virus 20x's less likely spread outdoors. Secondly, seen done areas hundreds miles nearest beach! 

Another issue would go U.S. news media says, outbreaks work place. Yep, none! miracle! Like Coronavirus hates work something! No, every outbreak happened family get together night club, graduation party someone's yard. Meanwhile, nearly every single one people state they're going work 8-10 hours day, offices never instituted work home going available anecdotal evidence, wear masks work.

In beginning, lot emphasis placed danger work place. Tyson plants, safe offices airborne, etc. went away become completely discussed topic American news media. Meanwhile, several threads Reddit turned people checking location saying office place work dangerous due windows open recirculate stale air - still forced come nobody told wear mask unless common areas. Many seemed Texas.

For reason, U.S. backwards comes contact tracing. South Korea elsewhere, instance, acknowledged early HOME likely place contract virus. figure article placed around 70% new infections. ""home"" can't shut down. people went home made lists likely places become infected: offices, churches, networking events, public transit, indoor dining.

I shake head every new outbreak story includes zero information patient zero family get together get together. 99 times 100, likely infected job open entire state heavily enforcing wearing masks. see South Korea, correctly viewed unnecessary indoor event preceded infected person going home give families start outbreak, seventh person line makes best, convenient, ""workplaces safe!"" Headline. Heard coronavirus we'd need least 60-80% reach herd immunity better damn well get it. really hope real number anti-vax nut jobs actually get vaccine high... guess we'll find soon That's awful. know he'd able join group? know hospitals stay mostly within pool people. Nothing else, cases keep rising, hospitals probably become desperate.

If months experience, might able try reapplying places. Maybe Parkland?

I know say except wish luck. Yes, trust Axios news — said one ever. DC socialite would add US doubt contact tracing really working. although believe transmission outside primary concern, wouldn’t surprise happened one confessed going outdoor event possibly getting COVID. tasked parent outreach performing live instruction. co teacher split students attending live sessions contacted almost daily ensure received attendance. even study lmao it’s pretty obvious reading replies, clearly missed call health department permission, ER. would emergency mandates trip ER, first must ask permission health department go.

I know local health department works, local one 9-5, usually 2 hour lunch. wake middle night, oxygen dropped 70's, well, might need wait 9am get permission slip go. Yes can, stupidity costing tens thousands constituents lives. WTF wrong you? Aha! Thank you. NIH Director visited US lately?  2020 - everything  
a political issue. right.

You stay healthy coming Corporate. Local stores simply enforce order. Walmart Home Depot today. Roughly 10% customers mask 20% mask-wearing customers wearing improperly. first read trump trying gop candidate 2024 sighed thought ""darn it, probably is.."" Except care. White House massively sanitized sealed zone, cannot get close Trump unless cleared rigorous testing. also assume strict rules people socialize outside work, go. cares, doesn’t care base. correct practice.  hard months get flight ticket China US, way round.  tickets see available website canceled eventually days departs, like ghost flights.  Look, I’m super excited this, news we’ve waiting for, don’t believe it’ll ready early. earliest I’d say December, I’m optimistic September. can’t even test everybody feels sick that’s original sin response this— don’t data come conclusions right now. NH = nursing homes

These hospital ships take coronavirus patients nursing home patients, makes whole argument top strict rules preventing people infected virus coming board, Navy also refusing treat host conditions. Based public comment videos, could densest place universe. everyone US go severe debt get 2020, anything possible. 🤷‍♂️

Stay safe!   Ah, MD like yeah, I'd say probably better vaccinate someone who's time. always surprising much MD allowed delegate.  sounds crazy 2020 can’t act surprised happens. Dude, don’t know cure cancer essential oils? Karen Facebook told me. /s. surrealistic. problem company making money, problem sharing recipe making money instead spreading vaccine recipe labs around world get quick S. Korea do-not-enter-country list. maintains list 'high risk countries' foreign nationals countries submit negative PCR test result boarding. ( extra protection. Anyone abroad two-week isolation, anyway. )
KCDC seem concern situation Latin American countries. ( accumulated fair amount statistics entrance quarantine. ) But, case think discrepancy, note exponent fractional (the R(0) value) subject change time. Also, arbitrary constants infection spread equation (social distancing, face masks, containment/quarantine facilities, escapees quarantine facilities, etc) affect final result. This, thank much comment. radiologic technologist get left time, yet Frontline nurses doctors. actually see patients nurses docs since run around whole hospital portable machine, work ER, work units. one?

They're reporting obesity &amp; diabeetus new covid cases?!    ^/s got lucky whirlwind circumstances gave golden opportunity become POTUS (8 years Obama whipping racists, Hillary historically bad candidate). I’m saying think that’s right. I’m saying feel defeated like giving days. feels like Florida people unstoppable force, I’m end rope.

I can't say I'd die shock proven true, either. different values him. making wrong decisions, can't argue he's stupid values align “We protest children kidnapped thrown cages fuck y’all won’t let us sing song we’ve sung 5000 times before” 🤷🏻‍♂️ Hang friends, responsible.

/s would choose money well. Thank you. 

(Please rescue us)  Thanks too. Username checks out. Canadian here. Normally used seeing crazy shit coming south boarder.

But this. I'm like, wow. Just, wow.

How bat-shit-crazy get prerequisite Republican 'leader'? husband says, even blind squirrel finds nut sometimes. Jumping onto top comment ask this. ever risk long term side effects vaccine rushed like this? I’m absolutely pro vaccine hoping get one ASAP I’m curious. Yes; thanks Cuomo placing elderly COVID patients back nursing homes......(sarcasm off). Why? vaccine like other. government run healthcare. Doctors hospitals guy pharmaceutical company makes it. approved,what government it? exactly see graft coming play? I'm worried enough people get vaccine finally fully stamp out. think meant take you-vacation. Spend week yourself, find hotel good internet won’t even cut PTO relax getting quiet minds week. Let’s send COVID-positive folks East Oakland Santa Rita Jail there. I’m sure AC Transit would loan bus free. Bangladesh extreme population density. population still overwhelmingly rural. Viruses spread easily densely populated urban areas, naive comparison population density averaged entire country work. e.g., paper, Canada Australia almost empty countries, 90% populations live major city effective population density higher even average Bangladesh. course, Dhaka far denser Toronto Sydney. 

The spread viruses also depend people doing. Cities like Hong Kong Tokyo super-dense, maybe dense Dhaka. people wearing masks, washing hands often, staying home much possible, virus contained. Hong Kong Tokyo far better US cities, even though US cities suburbanized fraction population density Asian countries. US badly Americans still partying, going bars gyms beaches. Air molecules .363 nanometers. N95 respirator filters particles 300 micrometers size. That’s nearly 600 times larger air molecules. airflow mask fine. 

Is excuse? it’s matter measurement, pretty basic fact. public behavior changed Florida all? Yeah people got March probably antibodies anymore. Someone versed medical field. chances vaccine makes stage 3 trials unforseen complications pop later?
(Before anyone accuses antivaxxer, believe vaccines, I've gotten them, baby baking get them, I'm genuinely curious higher risk due timetable development) bad, isn’t hard improve little. Like fat fuck loses 10 lbs. irony Figure make arrangements, way everyone spring summer. School education, free childcare. really like comment. :) I'm administrative assistant, although direct patient care, support doctors, managers, staff department 270 employees. get wrong, appreciate guys do, feel invisible sometimes. self quarantine, government quarantine centres. Outside centres mask wearing social distancing New Zealand, active cases. I've living parents' house Texas since December. move back state weeks. I've worried parents seeing every day. Can't imagine state worrying far entire time...nightmare fuel. 

Everyone smart mindful fellow humans staying home. We're definitely stir crazy moreso grateful other's health. Fingers crossed vaccine September. hope parents' good health continues. I've worked rich business owners part spoiled idiots inherited wealth. know less life people, I'm surprised consider employees disposable. decided take look like ""I mean lot stuff looks linear linear graph"" looked logarithmic graph straight line. Holy shit. values. want power. No, compile data directly states DOH (and even county levels sometimes numbers differ). tough spot there's good solution. want kids able school safe terrible home environment. would say giving parents option online in-person would best parents could make call what's best families, still leaves teachers choice whether exposed not. know good answer even one. Thirty feet? Outside? must safest dude land. get mail? recovered covid-19 patients 3 months immunity, way vaccine work. mandate employees enforce it? Problem employees ones deal customers president succeeded discouraging people coming US.... Hmm maybe work that. Plus mental health issues. can't stay home 24/7. need fresh air. think stay home 24/7 never leave homes think people mental health issues need get fresh air everyday disposable throw aways. check real time parks open. Disney World app scrollable map shows current wait times every ride. Oh! Hahaha makes sense. Thanks. PLEASE PLEASE Yep. one use leaks bit much. need find something better. considered quarantining 2 weeks able see other? It’s fool proof. allowed 1 year old daughter hug grandmother week. curbside pickup groceries going anywhere otherwise 2 weeks. 100% worth it. That’s cop out. Answer question. also, one gives f*ck sweden except sock puppet accounts useful idiots right keep trying push kind idiotic model. quiter literally, one earth ever said, let's sweden doing. Work home sick. can't work home, well, American business REALLY needs provide PTO everyone. feel compelled work sick. Four weeks standard god sakes throw holidays please like day thanksgiving, christmas eve nye. Maan, wont Trump shits US vaccine first. poster r/covid19positive last day two contacted outdoor cinema. maskless seated 6 feet coughing person. reasons said also want pay unemployment benefits.  Sucker bet. Would cut part country? That’s small amount money. addition unemployment benefits. would extra $409 enough? (Genuinely asking NV really good max it’s enough potentially live bit) Same! incredibly fortunate husband idiot following essential practices avoid covid-19. We’ve also working home. tell 4 months. Tennessee quite literally give fuck. Bars packed, restaurants packed, mall shopping places packed. It’s like it’s real doesn’t exist here, especially rural TN. Places service continuing operations positive tests workers, business usual except put “darn mask take soon sit table bar.” It’s baffling swear strange times. wonder types stories reach mainstream media? scary hear it’s occurring . hey man, you’re cunt online real reason. deal shit personal problems chill Arizona cases completely bottlenecked testing capacity moment- point case number useless.  Watch %positive testing delay numbers instead. want stay line 10hrs 100+ deg Lol.

You right call 'Fire' crowded theater, refusing movements monitored - if, - breaks quarantine, exactly doing.

Except rather trying induce panic, risking spreading lethal disease.

If want get two million dead Americans, keep insisting peoples right get sammich want overcomes duty keep community safe. mean...wait months. divorce may even necessary. Well fitted operative word there. I'd love see products improve seal around people noses. 

In addition annoyingly fogging glasses....that area huge huge hole armor. Air lazy. take path least resistance. fog glasses exhaling - breathing unfiltered air. many models show print money give American citizens threat massive inflation would still nonexistent. I’m pretty sure I’m worth $100,000/year 80 years. you’re lucky, you’re getting 45 years working. prayers, specifically. hope that's ok. Keep hanging there! course, forces everyone else risk infection assholes. greater tyranny? never really closed begin with. Allowing construction workers called ""essential workers"" ruined idea Mississippi shutdown meant cramming everyone Walmart Lowe’s. knew shutdown means Black Friday Southern speak. Stay away Indiana general   Hashtag Dawn Planet Atheists. wish. Symptoms usually much less severe however. Still carry virus still contagious believe everything read. tend think it’s coughing sneezing spreads mostly Chicago area Portillos drive thru states laws teachers striking. vast majority are

The ones still working, mean?  comment purely political post. political topic. can’t build immunity vaccines may prove ineffective due mutability virus, point say fuck it? Serious question. want know final outcome is. government considers tourist $ important health people actually live there. sad &amp; wrong. may unpopular opinion think places need issue stay-at-home order. close indoor dining places, ensure people always wear masks outside especially offices/stores. Ban gatherings people outside household, including religious services. Make sure stores 50% full mandate social distance. that's it. Asking people stay home LA people live private houses safely walk outside (if make effort) overkill. lot negative effects well. I'm sorry. That's biggest fear. mom exposed presumed positive March cried days. really hope mom feels better soon.

EDIT: know this, remind numbers favor. people diagnosed covid-19 recover survive. take care yourself. I’ll tell 2 year old learn play chess. Cool.

Some people’s kids different ages, realize. kids disabilities n shit too. countries already started opening then? rich-poor inequality China much greater America

by relative measure (GINI) China less economic inequality United States (0.385 vs 0.414 lower number representing closer full equality).

By number people abject poverty? Yes, China still developing nation - less 100 years ago China still split several colonial states primarily operated agrarian society run warlords. 

I see could even begin compare USA China given modern China started from.  Yeah never bought ""new normal"" bullshit. tired trope. might take years get there, plan going back concerts, bars, traveling etc.. year two. Pfft like billion people wont drop call 8+ I'm worried family's health. blunt,this you.

You realize irony here, yes? Everyone cares families else. wish people would realize stop self-righteous. Everyone selfish. are. are. am. human nature. 

A lot families can't put kids school can't work. able pay rent put food table kids. simple situation. capacity problem, steady moment overwhelmed

We put anyone cpap/bipap icu aerosolizes virus. Unfortunately hospital 2 negative pressure rooms outside icu. ICU every room one, makes sense there. That’s relief. there’s anyone trust right now, it’s federal government! copy paste address field www.outline.com . unpaywall many sites.

Often archive.is -- idea one better other? I'm surprised They've already digested fourth July cases you’re arms global pandemic killing hundreds thousands causing potentially lifelong issues millions more, recommend reacting? There's much medical treatment available anymore. Testing isn’t free state? means endemic, like flu. people build immunity one strain, get hit different strain. Crude.     
Refined .. ""America Florida world."" government really capable bailing people? We’ve bailed billion dollar corporations plenty times. good innocent always pay. greedy evil always win. never come close true yet.. FTFY kids mean. They're less susceptible they?  child building wall blocks? Lmao thought watching SNL skit first time saw that. that's cult IDK imagine would mean reinfection possible. can't see would mean ADE possible. Please expand. Went visit Germany last year. Wifi &amp; mobile data made feel like travelled back time lol admit look that. I'm sure Canada deportations. knew value, me, trying live hiding foreign country. suggest others, unless *truly* desperate... Also people work administration offices hospitals.  Insert made-up timeline here. got stimulus checks once, again? every country figured coronavirus problem haven’t? one first got really suspicious: /user/ohwowlookitsme

There's lot accounts, like one: /user/LIJoe86

But bots conspicuous top nursing home talking point, I'm wondering Russian troll factory St. Petersburg working overtime. doubt anti-cuomo bots running rampant thread yt twitter. Maybe trying lay foundation attacking Cuomo inevitably runs higher office? case Biden can't run ever reason? Well make sure it’s included response whole reason we’re shit we’re context lack proper leadership making decisions using science.   watched video, state anything exact payment them. time see money amounts even mentioned showing subsidy amounts. go province, worker.

But provide time mentioned would willing watch again.

The video positive towards whole situation, all. looks like transmission slowing states outbreaks moment, testing still way low Ive never experienced side effects flu vaccine take every year. charge save world. least we'll save los angeles. no. Vaccine them. *Mandatory* vaccine unless DO, MD, DNP signs able take one actual health reasons.

The way get past totally *drag* fucking sentient potatoes across finish line us. Otherwise COVID always present threat. honest you, I'm letting life go back anything less whole nightmare started accommodate small subsection dipshits can't wear mask. 

I behaved, behaved. We've already punished bullshit enough. play ball, drag it. kids can't go school without vaccines; say *they* can't go public spaces without vaccinated COVID. Free real estate. Huh. Move numbers CDc voila. Less cases.  op literally worship Queen's stool. called grooming stool shits uk subjects citizens supposed worship  56 Florida ICUs hit capacity two weeks ago. know Reddit “America bad” sentiment reigns supreme, would ignorant think United States “only” helped manufacturing actual vaccine. 

Even CEO Astra-Zeneca would vehemently disagree you. direct quote, [Pascal Soriot said: “We would like thank **US** UK governments substantial support **accelerate development** production vaccine. everything power make vaccine quickly widely top link, says, “[AstraZeneca today received support $1bn US Biomedical Advanced Research Development Authority (BARDA) **development**, production delivery vaccine, starting matter slice it, US influential providing help every aspect get vaccine created. “winners” “losers” scenario. global effort sake humanity.

That's true, though. paying better quality MILITARY. nation prioritizes aircraft carriers healthcare system. about, wear damn mask! Best worlds: less death, businesses still operate.

""assuming economy crash"" implying skepticism. economy absolutely crash. Many people already lost houses,their life savings, businesses. already happening little assistance we've given even run yet. 

We can't possibly sure number confirmed cases anywhere near actual cases. thing floating around world since December January. could 10 20x actual cases people already gotten this. imply significantly lower threat. 

So basically saying is: despite anywhere near enough data, guarantee destruction human life fear POSSIBLE destruction human life. problem with.

Edit: Also, noticed tried claim came .006 death rate. claimed kind death rate. data make claim, even experts do. Yeah, opinion, I'm feeling pretty confident it. add me, we'll see year wether right?

I feel confident it, down? afford it. know lot people even state exchanges fucking afford it. Also, vaccines 100% effective even us taking may reliant herd immunity everyone else taking without even knowing. 

Fauci said he'd happy 70% effective vaccine. That's _just_ enough reach heard immunity everyone takes it. Let's see actually get. tried making argument too. response every time was:

Many thanks u/deirdresm u/ravend13 bringing attention back significance filopedia induction. read STAT's original report finding revisited subject since. couple questions would much appreciate answer mind:

1a) paper notes filopedia viruses ""promotes ... cell-to-cell spread across epithelial monolayers"". relate permeabilization pulmonary endothelium described? 
1b) mean cellular infection via filopedia occur independent ACE2 binding? 
1c) TMPRSS2 priming? 
1d) Furin cleavage?

2) infected cells replicating via filopedia region respiratory tract (for example let's say CSF) successfully evading neutralizing antibody recognition, would reasonable expect throat swab PCR test come back negative? S. Korea megachurch again. There’s definitely rosy outcome!

However, one choice allows us say “We tried save millions lives. analyzed risks possibility virus severe, took precautionary measures.” American, can’t even say “we tried.” I've trying find material faking mental illness, could find years meds developed series tool order identify fakers. seems hard, almost impossible, fake well enough fool tests. may inconclusive patients, could become anecdotes, small minority. like Trump. Actually no. CE (president-equvilent) never tell people wear masks recently.

All response people mostly due nightmare SARS, government instructions.

Realistically people US likely get free, similar get flu vaccine free every year. “free” mean health insurance companies and/or government pick tab.

They made covid-19 testing free, likelihood vaccine free too. mean pay it, since could go either ways hurt one way cure you. Read link find bud Sounds like famous last words. Everyone (central Florida) seems think virus hoax still. Almost nobody wears masks.

I'm exception, isolated since February, quarantining groceries month (or soaking peroxide, practical), everything reasonable certainty virus never enters home (where babies would certainly find way ingest it).

It's becoming clear we're going stay home several months least. :(

That said, anyone know get new P100 even sure I'm buying right thing; ideally covering entire face (right now, best shooting glasses cover eyes, obviously less desirable)?

An insulin vial costs 5 - 10 USD US according diabetic friend cheapest 95 USD.
Hope that, like rest world, developed developing, get vaccination free,.
And seriously hope bill pushed pharma companies charge realistic prices American costumers. also 50 years testing advancements important. hard dead Oh, see.That's he/she meant. I'm saying stated true case, but...Right Covid identified states, white supremacist groups stated would take measures increase spread. included things like spitting hands touching doorknobs, gross acts.

Who knows?

Don't take word it, though. search.

Edit: typo clarification Well, fact implying skepticism economic crash shows delusional least sense.

Wait, what? think might different pages here. original comment referring conversation I’ve people. skepticism imply (or think implied)?

Even experts aren’t 100% sure death rate yet. experts know fact virus incredibly infectious. Suppose let virus play 330 million Americans get infected. believe aren’t going hit millions deaths. won’t hit 2 million deaths. 2 million deaths 330 million infections death rate 0.00606. 

We confirmed ~150k deaths (not accounting 30-40k additional deaths aren’t deemed COVID still put us expected death count point year). also 3.8 million confirmed cases. understand number higher. according death rate 0.00606, actually nearly 25,000,000 COVID cases. part research allows confidently say 25,000,000 people virus? seen single reputable source mathematical model implies number high. think people misunderstood comment. comment bad all. FL reports 10k cases day 5 days row, Yet many schools FL still set open partially in-classroom teaching children parents selected brick mortar, parents make selection deadline.

*Please take 5 minutes help protect Florida teachers following steps here: I'm ticked many people holding strong opinions something I've seen little evidence on. Assuming much data yet. real info here? pog That's additional. new 90 million, breakdown shows. discounted marketplace healthcare $350 month unemployment $105 week. catch telephone now. Also Tn (Clarksville). I’m starting see people wear mask that’s good   peed floor store... obviously unwell. Mostly do. least better/more america - tbh difficult. hey go on. tragic odd way entertaining also eye opening. Idk Americans give willingly country death misery

Racism mostly. Herd immunity real thing. Hello yes visiting “drive alaska” thank *drives straight pharmacy load vaccine insulin mom*
Even paying whatever fine canada levies, still cheaper vaccine insulin America... 7 months. Jesus Christ really long? Thank breakdown. well versed US taxes French.  Imagine Cyber Monday instead... Well wasn’t subtle  smoking inside restaurant.  USA - third world county wearing Gucci belt. military 15% federal budget. That's insane, especially considering we're also subsidizing Europe's defense via NATO.

Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid together eat 60% budget. Government Accountability Office projects Social Security require 100% budget 2030s. like not, that's cuts made, since Franklin Dumbass Roosevelt created unsustainable scam.

It's like meme twitter post asking help budgeting, he's spending $3,000 month candles. Someone tells spend less candles says no. Yes idiots refuse wear mask ones know covid positive still go shop, go restaurants work parks tell anyone spread like crazy. due respect, that's adult decision recent fetus like worried things first came day. plenty time refine identity learned basics like speech object permanence. paper April 29th? therapies developed research? Oh FFS... ""scientists unsure"" nonsense non-news, worse, tends promote unfounded fear.

This virus similar enough SARS (it's literally called SARS2) much [SARS applies. ""There many coronavirus cases. said them, stop testing!""
-Your president 70k cases day. Usa damn businesses thinking opening schools. Surreal Haven’t lived fear Corona upon me?  smallest sensation, allergy, little rush adrenaline, slight constaption, change air pressure causing moment headache, cough dinner....these normally ignorable moments become something much real anxiety building. 

A nation hypochondriacs reason hypochondriacing. flu vaccine free -- insurance picking cost. paying mean paying. place offers ""free flu shots"" tiny little asterisk right next ""free"" phrase. show without insurance expect pay *something*.  literally true. There's federal fund compensate people injured vaccines complete total immunity vaccine manufacturers. Now, would vaccines safe? massive uptick austim come vaccines? I've frightened years certainly will... don’t get people assume things UK haven’t case decades. America anything like it. Close WTF? fucking kidding me???? bad ass sun parties popping left right?! crazy. Well need highlight indian govt implemented lockdown cases low way like bolsanro Trump.  failure enough tests done intial stages saying need note india medical facilities bad took time improve testing facilities though absolute testing numbers still low. Indian people also responsible. city Mumbai effected, beaches open people flocked like . Also city Certain community dominated areas want follow rules gather nos without even mask social distancing followed areas. saying personal experience seen eyes wil target change fact . Also talking peole wearing mask u need see peole people wear mask mouth covering mouth nose . stupidity people India also people spitting roads , tried correct can't everyone . combination stupidity Indian population govt. Though govt shd done better testing migrant issue takes two weeks get death certificate family member dies. actually physically mail deliver death certificate state even finalized. Ah yes amount time environment directly attributable likelihood infection. 

Im going trust medical doctors- NYtimes article. 

Mainly theyre biased, active liars, medical professionals. 1-5% 328 million? You’re right, should’ve mentioned financial assistance part. something believe in. left original comment discussions people referred to, don’t believe either. 

Until multiple studies confirming belief many people caught became pandemic, can’t act it. would wonderful thing right see you’re coming from, science statistics don’t work beliefs. Based data have, still statistically significant chance incorrect. There’s statistically significant chance virus high death rate. two chances align don’t take precautionary measures, millions die America alone. confidence two chances align, take precautionary measures.  Don’t call personal risk virus kill somebody contacts later case affected. Fucking idiot! Got mask then. ^^^^^^ofuk must go on. 

Why? course, whole idea “smart thing” isn’t really American way Exactly this. Australia Victoria. need permit enter state spread control Lmao. Americans thought untouchable Ya, really, employees get paid enforce this, gonna fun. do:

- Ban them

- Thank horrible example could happen

- Give suggestions get ignored

Exactly didn’t reopen Disney? think buy 66 million doses. vaccine work, buy others they've already bought 66 million? maths teacher? Barcelona mayor Ada Colau applauded Catalan government's new restrictions city also asked, Friday, events including Festival Grec, Cruïlla XXS, les Nits del Fòrum Sala Barcelona still allowed take place.

I mean...

At point, realize shooting foot, right?

Public health experts really need start clear this:

Here options:

1. Festival Grec, lockdown.

2. lockdown.

Which choose?

This seem optimal social distancing: this? Cross 2020 event calendar. Nothing happening. need be, find way financially support events make comeback next year (if vaccine developed), give 2020. tried teaching online? work schools (non teaching role) bloody hard. run social skills program 8 children time. Sure, class hard bit online near impossible. uses lot mental energy. class, auto pilot kick relax converse kids. Online happen. 


Only benefit online teaching.... dont get beaten children weekly basis. would trade back class rather teach online. safe so. Almost everyone income UK due furlough scheme government paying everyone can't work virus' wages October. report suggesting delays normal healthcare may cause deaths. We're calling Florida virus now?

I'm opposed that. Monday morning. First thing. National + State tax combined?
In France married 1 child combined income 96k EUR, would take home 65k EUR imagine, maybe bit less, maybe bit more, around mark, 1/3rd least paid income tax + social contributions. that’s case really way safely reopen restaurants bars? reality can’t eat drink mask therefore spread seems inevitable... test less less cases right.....

If Tree falls forest one around hear make sound? think wearing mask first place, prevent exposure,"" Reynolds said. 



Wrong!


I wear mask prevent everyone else's exposure.

You wear mask prevent everyone else's exposure.


Good know masks great job trapping Covid-19.


If inside mask coated Covid-19 already infected.


If outside mask coated Covid-19 someone infected Covid19 probably refused wear mask avoid close contact you. People scared tired desperately want thing done want entertain anything might suggest worse know keep getting worse. see anything negative questioning hope, questioning hope upsets lot people severely. Unfortunately, go away, worse know.

Sometimes wonder it’s misconception Americans due overstating stories stupid people.


We fair share idiots too, usually ashamed them, put newspaper 😂 c19 make difference deal? They've selfish generation humans ever. thing ends dynamic people like death. Korea 5 groups, one day person classes... bad situation hospitals? No, completely wrong shows fundamental misunderstanding mutations coronaviruses.

If print genome virus it'll hundreds pages saying ""coronavirus"". mutation MEAN ANYTHING MAJOR changed virus all.

All hundreds pages, ""coronaviures"" ""coronavuieres"" shit there.

It COULD change virus, coronaviruses common. 

Source: Drosten, SARS1 discoverer, creator Sars-Cov2 test literally one leading virologists talking talking ass ffs. annoying. state constitution prohibits income tax. I'm sorry hear that. hope recovers. Good luck! got results, stopped infectious?

The first days contracted virus, feel symptoms, infectious. One week show symptoms, almost infectious all.

To get results two weeks tested useless. Oh read, believes unconstitutional so, chooses to. Yes, can't assume people who've taking precautions.

If immunity around 6 months say people who've still immune. We're months past peak Europe. 10 thousand maximum readout!
What mean?
*They gave us number had!* Given interacting people Qatar, I'd better safe sorry. Yup. cause blip. 4 weeks actual impact go straight business usual still climbing... Said another way. body might 3 lines defence. Someone diabetes, heart condition, kidney problems 1 line defence left. comes covid19 take last line. definitely covid19 that's killing here. It’s kind simplistic demonization makes guys intolerable. miss trip eu? ever loving fuck navy going do? Aside humanitarian effort possible enforcement

Aside they’re effective local PD hospitals Interesting, Ohio, it’s exact opposite allocating purposes. Even tests don’t get counted toward states total fair concerns imo total crazy (I mean rushed rona vaccine). would prefer people Impact well humanity get first. try get vaccine studys online Marketing (for example) running shoes expendable Doc s, parents on... tbh idk follow recommendations professionals. say safe accept happy.

Sorry bad english.

Edit: aware safety measures different Clinical studys Damn sobering thought. That's crazy... virus disturbing mask. good reason think virus literally cannot get younger children well, protein virus uses enter cells expressed nearly children; i.e., . find interesting Newsweek reported way. article's title text are, technically, incorrect! bahamas close border US citizens, closed airport seaport commercial travel! That's huge difference private travel still allowed.

Yes, Nassau Grand Bahama island rely heavily US commercial travel tourism see think ""paradise island"" Atlantis. large number private pilots fly ""out islands"" plane can, easily, get there!

My comment show spin story factual. correct Americans cannot travel Bahamas right ones bring money economy still (private jets). EU blocked US citizens, Bahamas would become desirable destination wealthy. That's good economy show low COVID numbers possible people going Disney right also go Nassau next week!  would require money, though 

Honestly could plan cost. need many teachers online courses, could fire extraneous teachers use wages pay ""babysitters."" I’m central Florida, currently going 15 days 12 days girlfriend. Definitely pandemic! really see that's relevant, resources scaled population. like state gets 6 labs regardless. count academic report? Let know I'll correct flair! Much ""permanent damage"" light. kinds illnesses leave kind permanent trace you. would referred ""damage"". possibly damage lungs right living polluted area smoker while. study claiming almost 1600 mild covid infections studied resulted permanant damage

People need careful read things. Lets analyze said Netherlands,**a study recently conducted 1,622 covid-19 patients long-term symptoms**.

So chose Covid patients complained long-term effects. people made study long-term symptoms. felt fine Covid, wouldnt average age patients 53 years 91 percent needed hospital care course disease thus fall category ""mild symptoms"".

Ok. Mostly ""mild Covid"". fell ill, 85 percent people classified healthy. One several months falling ill covid-19, 6 percent considered healthy.

So ""one several"" months people Covid, probably asked ""How would rate health now?"" probably given multiple choice. Maybe looked like - would currently rate health? a) Really bad .. b) kind bad .. c) mainly healthy minor quibbles .. d) ""healthy""

And .. ""one several months"" encounter infamous Covid virus, 1,600 former surveyed Covid patients study still complaining long-term effects, 6% described ""healthy"". give idea, read multiple times +11 day (+/- 1 day) infection often worst part. really now? tore temp hospitals built? Ah thanks. realize that. Demand government support working people like elsewhere. Brain fog, fatigue, breathlessness. Rehab centers set across Europe treat long-term effects Raises hand unfortunate indeed. friends US take situation seriously, (Italy) sacrificed much get situation control can't risk resurgence. NJ densest state. people packed per area. noteworthy. Ah see, Thankyou. Slow chaos UK still EU , true, less Russia.

But improved lot 2 months, still need double due nationwide backlog 10 days (non guess time machine 50s women that. watch Netflix. 100% nails it. definitely true. People generally go Vegas stay indoors too. Kyle?

Karen's husband cousin? You’re understanding hospitals
Or hospital beds work. 

You realize even though Covid going people get sick, injured need hospital care? 

The fact novel virus taking 1/4 whole hospital, yes it’s pretty bad. 

Many states cut elective surgeries back March free room hospitals constantly running people them. 

Obviously that’s issue country (anymore/yet) 1/4 hospital capacity taken one thing, that’s pretty bad. Yeah, go get sodium dichromate sulfuric acid, mix sample smell it. That's safe effective average person. hope brand crap bought methanol it.

When crap going end? Right, it’s 50 years much improvement. Proves point. bet can’t even name 10 improvements vaccine testing last 50 years. You’re making things up.  Yes already stated that.

Lol ain't testing shit tho, yesterday tested like 19 k people got like 1.5 k cases lol Clearwater, still know anyone personally. expect next weeks.

Age single important risk factor covid-19. Sweden, average age among died disease 82 years, 90 per cent deceased older 70 years. figures similar rest world. One explanation usually highlighted many older people also underlying diseases, make body extra vulnerable.

But according new research review journal Science, body's tissues immune system also change otherwise perfectly healthy elderly people way important understand order able provide right treatment covid-19. Similar skin's cells age make us wrinkle outside, passage time also noticeable inside body, researchers explain. various tissues, aging cells begin emit substances irritate immune system. gives rise low-grade so-called sterile inflammations, occur even though body infected infectious agent.

The phenomenon called ""inflammaging"" English - far good Swedish word missing - lead immune system functioning worse body defend real infection. example, evidence low-grade inflammation interferes development antibodies prevents body's cells fighting viruses. addition, risk increases immune system's killer cells begin strike wildly body's cells, example lungs, common reason covid-19 leading death.

\- becoming increasingly clear us research immunology type sterile inflammation plays important role. found older people different tissues, see immune system changes increasing age. well known far, data, says Anna Smed Sörensen, associate professor immunology Karolinska Institutet.

She thinks new research review interesting, points still lot known comes aging healthy body.

\- problem mainly know body changes disease, pick tissue body healthy people anyway. know lot blood skin, fairly easily accessible, know much less lungs age, example. would important knowledge comes covid.

According researchers behind article Science, low-grade infections also affect body's ability respond vaccines, ability produce specific antibodies impaired. line early results ongoing trials develop covid-19 vaccine. first analyzes show older people develop many antibodies younger people. worst case, lead group needs protected extra carefully able get help need vaccine.

According researchers, problem could managed combining vaccination anti-inflammatory drugs. ""Reducing inflammation important treatment strategy strengthen immunity elderly,"" write article.

\- Although likely vaccine effect all. case, also make sure vaccinate everyone else. Flock immunity bad reputation, biological principle still crucial protect risk groups, virus nowhere go, says Anna Smed Sörensen.

**Facts: ""Inflammaging""**

The English term inflammaging combination words inflammation aging, describes phenomenon older people often suffer low-grade inflammations due infection. process noticeable age 60.

Exactly inflammation occurs older age clear. One reason cells stop dividing ends chromosomes, telomeres, become short. cells begin send substances, including cytokines, irritate immune system.

Even misfolded protein accumulates various tissues activate immune cells supposed clean away substances. also studies show adipose tissue inflammatory properties.

Last checked, average time test result nine days Florida, similar Arizona Texas.

It untenable situation. action taken “flatten curve” results wouldn’t appear test data well two weeks. also means people would start complaining actions useless working, leading poorly informed people spreading illness ignoring actions feel working.

I’m Bermuda turn tests around five eight hours. valid reason test taking nine days overwhelmed system allocating required resources testing. purely politically-driven attempt “smooth” reporting doesn’t look bad really is. fair, there’s number reasons likely literally interesting thing they're capable of. shut whore mouth. 6 years get 10,000 new cases every day

If exponential growth picks again, stay 10,000 new cases per day. I'll studying Groningen first semester, likely move Belgium next one. reading [this Dutch government's site, mentions self-quarantine travellers outside EU, Schengen area United Kingdom need self-quarantine 14-days arrival Netherlands. exemption made travellers following countries \[list countries, Vietnam included\]

Obesity kills another person...... smart states shut Floriduh wide open. Many people sick tired restrictions, want go fun. prob people thinking hoax.  became glaringly obvious Tuesday afternoon phone call, couldn’t execute that.

There's also fact they'd sending notifications every day. point 1% US population tested positive. school size Marietta, 8000 students faculty, that's 80 people who've tested positive since testing started. infections still accelerating.

So what's point opening school sending notification someone infected multiple people day likely diagnosed?

Edit: checked Cobb County, Marietta is, 1.1% population test positive. Science attacked decades 2 big reasons US: Evolution Climate Change (and bit smoking question too). two things super obvious follow science therefore GOP make ok ""question science"" (not scientific skepticism denialism). eroded trust science, giving status ""opinion"" ""fact"". People feel correct questioning science. left also horrible anti-science stance nuclear GMO, level way.

I recommend reading ""Merchant Doubt"" conservatives US used handful scientists create doubt science smoking, ozone hole global warming (the exact bunch scientist 3 times). terrifying. Aside continuing exponential growth, problem “flattening curve” would flatten at...10,000+ cases day.

A huge part whole logic behind dramatically dropping case count unlocking don’t actually need eradicate spread, keep flat, we’ve heard. means R0 1. Doesn’t much 1, though. Let’s say it’s .99, even. 50 cases day, you’ll pretty much continue 50 cases day vaccine. 10,000 day...you’ll continue 10,000 day.

And R0 clearly 1 yet states numbers continuing go up. It’s almost foregone conclusion point something drastic needs happen point, like second lockdown. Scientists saying too, me.

Maybe masks limited restrictions alone enough shrink numbers significantly. Probably not, though. flatten curve get R0 bit 1 cases slooowly decline. Maybe. sound like downer, but... get comfy yet.

As far gather actually broke quarantine all, questioning safety needing consent seek emergency care resulted state slapping tracking devices.

I strict enforcement quarantine, seems bit complicated ""muh freedoms"" there's context I'm curious, baby novel disease known take rapid turns worst might question too. Okay you’ve confirmed.. it’s okay students need accommodations health reasons teachers. sums level respect teachers. Thanks clarifying. idiots like moving them. always reducing deaths reducing number permanently injured virus. We’re knock gucci bag Still got admit strange deaths going down. would think would going up. happening? causing this? I'm guessing people going say young people getting really huge deal since really affect them. still spreading older people? would increase death rate? would interested know death rates low. Could virus mutating? president elected January, mean SotHoR gets inaugurated election held?

I'm strangely okay that. problem initial policy stay home. Except super small company, management probably recognized leave without pay significant periods time/ using entire years vacation (depending amount accrued), would result employee searching new job, possibly lawsuit.

Thats because, TN, took 9 days test results come back, 3 weeks ago!

The best option would let work home, pay can't accordance new law... yep, here's non sequitur ""US bad"" comment, right schedule. Park never opened first place. Disney tons money. afford play staff even keeping park closed months. reopening increase number cases. no. kind measures take engaging necessary essential activities medical care, transport, food buying preparation etc. things, simply IT. That's reasonable safe thing do! stage epidemic state, Disney World completely non-essential matter safe make things, irresponsible greedy.

Sure, lot public places around Europe also opening similar measures. mean ok everywhere! None 100% safe. reduces risk. existing risk way high fucking count barriers, distancing, disinfectants make ok! get tested still disease. still spread kill people. risk take getting test positive prevents able leave house. risk rest us stay home. friend group anymore, unfortunately.

""You've probably gotten someone sick killed before, cracking open infant skull drinking blood hardly different!!""

Great logic there.

Knowingly going deadly infectious disease different unknowingly causing someone harm. Obviously. assume uninsured? Obamacare requires insurers pay approved vaccines cost sharing. Althought went wrong pharmacy plan...Walgreens vs CVS...and said ""screw it"" paid 35$ EDIT except around 3 Million people bought new short term Trumpcare plans...they cover vaccines. Well boys, could finally it. It’s really tough light shining brighter Thanks. What's turn around time though? Seen plenty people saying 2 weeks. use that? Ya. I’m hoping makes clear certain costs socialized. Healthcare universal humanitarian reasons also practical reasons. people’s healthcare tied jobs economy creates mass layoffs compounds problem. jobs lost public health reasons others barely effected, makes sense provide wage supports effected. America failed fronts largely due cult individualism. mask issue ultimate indictment idea. people see farce. People also want hear wrong.

I would say like Nazi Germany way subtle that. false, cities/counties shut down. Miami example. Again, he's right, statistically. look relationship cases deaths US far cases similar deaths. ratio deaths cases excellent America. Try yourself. depends lab provider using. know folks waited close 3 weeks, mine got turned around less 3 days. Chlorine. requires proper maintenance levels, course... Thats question. tried switching AT&amp;T instead Verizon? tried turning again? tried troubleshooting within Windows 10 settings? searched forums find answer? make sure power supply plugged wall? tried factory reset data recovery option? tried removing parts putting back together again? tried ramming screwdriver socket tower? 

I THINK NOT! horrific. I’m sorry boyfriend go that. managed stay negative. Also, people dying, scream ventilated unconscious? ran meds? People go restaurant. property reputation line. I'm sure legally business anything. People vote wallet go somewhere else. sure government needs something people themselves. Truest form karma right here.... steering ship

into iceberg order Republican short sighted hypocrite empathy. stat paper: Ohio, 12 weeks Mar 15 - Jun 6, age group 20-49, 66 official covid19 deaths estimated 366 ""excess deaths"".

That's pretty insane. would surprised states way worse. show SuperStore basically subplot several seasons covers point. crazy shame. Yes pay can't afford ask help.

We pandemic people dying. Everyone sacrifice one way another. People losing job. people dont wear mask, dont isolate themselves, pandemic go longer needed. financially troubled. Yes, comment shows self centered one. 
 
Our economy keep getting hit people part. Wow, would guessed one dumbest place universe pay off? r/awardspeechedits clear, treatment slashes death risk. mean? Depends test.

As contagion little study address issue writing, corona cold virus probably safe say contagious.

That said, read Covid studies clearly said whether people 'reinfected covid' contagious not. Really, science community accepted reinfection thing, air.  Even related ... ""Alexander Hamilton, Alexander Hamilton""?

People lose oxygen quickly still, arent public, hospital home. stupid reason thought like instantaneous hotline something every hospital reports daily. makes sense.

that would actually make sence, every hospital call cdc set new thing monitor daily totals, 100% accurate would least give real time picture whats going on, official numbers come fully proccesed something bit later No, know get covid die it, die covid. several friends recently pushing vitamins me. Specifically they're pushing vitamin C vitamin D. claim taking 175% RDA grants high resistance covid-19. also claim many studies back up. can't find anything legit sources.

The FDA several years ago issued type guidance drug manufacturers longer name drugs intended effects. ProAir Abilify Levitra. Instead they'd come syllabic combinations mimetic mechanism action. Fine! names ""Viberzi"" ""Harvoni"" mellifluous roll tongue. exactly intention behind names like ""Vraylar"" ""Arnuity""? fucking Taltz. taking C, D, B complex, zinc, magnesium regularly months got covid. lasted month. nutrients allow immune system may help overcome covid, it’s going absolutely nothing prevent contracting it.  No, RNA test detectable levels viral RNA. could virus test negative bunch reasons. example, incorrect swabbing low viral levels. 

The antibody tests indicate recently virus. Though everyone develops antibodies. 2 days? appointment made one hour calling closest clinic, phone triage interview test results back 4 hours, (the fast version), northern Minnesota. reason took hour appointment hospital 40 miles away.

By way 5G killing babies.. according guy 1.7GPA. someone explain Trump allowed push policies hurt Americans led 140k Americans dying, complain comments get removed?

How else change supposed happen can’t even talk about? actions demonstrably worse comments anyone could post. Florida, California Kentucky reporting record near-record numbers new cases, Texas hospital official told NPR funeral homes morgues overflowing bodies COVID-19 victims.  [Fox News aired Sunday, president repeated assertion first made late February COVID-19 would ""disappear"" own, saying initial prediction would prove correct.  right eventually,"" president said interview Fox's Chris Wallace.  said going disappear.

That's lot reason need flatten curve: many patients dangerous subject disease-ridden hospital wards, dire choices made. don’t tell twice. still apartment Denver soon lease ends, i’m quitting job getting fuck here

Stay strong friend, we’re gonna make healthcare free, pay premiums taxes. ripoff rate though terrible deal healthcare consumers. 💯 yep. strange crap like spread across nation. montana bar (SHOE) stated young employees went get tested hospital never swabbed tests came back positive. shared insane social media posts whole friend friend said happend hospitals faking covid test results.

The owner bar stated health department calling harassing employees making cry knows plandemic supports dtrump

Anyways bar anything following covid19 guidelines, social distancing anti-mask turds. couple employees test positive customers well huge party 4th. magically closed ""deep cleaning "". owner refuses transparent Community infection bar still continues deny virus, responds plandemic conspiracy social media posts anyone concerned establishment. better old drug. they're brain dead. Nothing it. keep track secondary covid related deaths. historical accurate account least. Thank you! Great explanation early modern Calvinist thought Yep. openly stole election zero repercussions. infrastructure reporting never put place.

I'm software team lab testing software got abruptly pulled this, we're literally writing API calls able send results GET request right now. Previously, used exporting results Excel sending along they'd compiled monthly basis.....

We technology instant reporting, never got pushed implement this. previously timeline implement planned improvements order two years. got told two months. also refuse stop using air conditioning even though greatly increases ability spread. Yeah people like Steven Smith throw fits try get restraining orders director health Mayor Cooper. Tourist still coming ""this Nashville know"" 

Like shit dumbass, everything changed middle global pandemic even bar. 

Sorry rant. frustrating Governor would rather focus letting people get abortions actually protecting people already alive. Would good catch COVID American lot lizard.

There's nothing crash (and shiver--because usually fever spike follows).

My point innate immune response becomes disordered, may never recover. keep mine check expensive drug cocktail corticosteroids immunomodulators (both used treat Covid), I'm wondering many Covid long haulers need similar, lifelong treatment.

Who standardizes it? One biggest issues US public schools lack quality, *unbiased* curriculum. Instead states fought include Creationism alongside science, teach abstinence-only sex education, whitewash history US...

I agree basic life skills, *especially* finance, kids understand concept debt well enough get crippling student loans long high school. One wonders bias, well. top excess pneumonia deaths, something wrong here.

Since Stockholm Region introduced free testing covid-19, tens thousands people tested themselves. received positive test result asked contact people vicinity may exposed virus.

Now infection control Stockholm goes one step wants tested positive also confirm region's app infection tracking completed. Anyone confirm contacted newly established group helps infection tracing.

Hardly anybody listened thought kidding, thinking gonna another minor outbreak like ebola. ""oh another flu"" Gimme break. Influenza still kills many people every year, people fact check themselves. COVID-19 much worse influenza, fought times life. Wait 5 minutes... talking China. literally demographic never lives alone I'm UK, always felt grasp American politics. 

But mask thing.....this another level. cannot, life me, understand Trump would screaming supporters American public general wear masks last 5 months. 

I can't even.... would restaurants even bother re-opening dine-in 10 days? look bright sight, top 1% got billion dollar richter

Yikes. Yes! Every batch going come back positive. what?

Back COVID-19 rampant US everyone needs tested. According polls, us want it. controlled wealthy minority political system.

Child abuse, confessed almost seems good true. long way go, sure hell promising. Good News flair exists doomers filter out. little bit hope it’ll shared since it’s American developed vaccine. valley? Canadian truckers pull out, Alaska fucked. rely completely trucked goods goods sent boat. Everything would collapse two weeks. Alaska keep food supplies runs seat pants. grow enough locally supplement shipped goods slightly. close Canadian borders we're pretty much trapped here. wear muh seatbelt neither, ain't big govment conspiracy gon' take away rights! World's biggest leper colony. don’t think so? sure do... 😞 know people told getting vaccine if/when arrives long term effects unknown. Genuine question, vaccine get tested long term effects developed quickly? Would possible vaccine like could cause real issues future? live Boston everyone know utterly terrified August bring. Colleges reopen start moving students mid-August. Harvard MIT fully online BU, Leslie, Tufts need students come least week. Plus I've heard they're relaxing campus housing means even students integrated city. There's going massive imported wave Covid coming. Oof good point. Apologies.  everywhere though. Canada, especially BC less 10 people ICU across whole province 5 million highest survival rates critically ill patients. also allowing compassionate visits proper PPE. Technically give instructions make antibodies gives instructions cells produce viral antigens present immune system. allows immune system search appropriate antibodies develop immunity. Throwing money problem doesn’t make people friend /s Get ready incredibly goth school year. 

I stopped believing god 4 months 2020*. Please shut fuck up. Mr. Puddin’? correct lot officials ready say everybody wear mask back march, even shelter places started. 

I wonder much resistance due DHS's concerns breaking facial recognition systems everyone wears them. Wait minute. sun? better cancel reservations. far know, it’s supply thing. hospital work tests result within hour, limited supply. unless people admitted get standard one takes 2-3 days (or longer) muppet muppet Ronald Grump's muppet. keep trying noone listens True, falls deaf ears  still want move that, lot people right behind you.

No won’t. Trump got elected, massive influx people looking moving Canada. idea died mass exodus America. interest leaving actually leave aren’t thing.

Also, even leave, could still cast absentee ballot. Americans abroad still get vote. they’re likely leave November. Immigrating Canada isn’t driving border. There’s process, probably big part see story people wanting leave, don’t actually leaving. independence referendum Texas happen again? Eli5 guess forgotten literally everything he's done last 4 months exacerbate greatest disaster modern American history. Good. love football sports general, plan keep players families safe, what’s point? three aspects make complicated.

First, getting one infection still unlikely places, like 1 : 100 probability. things equal, person getting infected twice, even immunity all, probability 1: 10000. So, cases still happen often. become relevant relatively large proportion population already infected.

Second, well possible mild serious infection earns, say, three months immunity, much more. that's case, immunity degrading, first slowly quicker. time three months would mean people NY began US, moment still protected many might infected two three months now.

The third is, unclear **not** entirely hypothetical. exist reports people infected twice. time tell whether unusual, isolated occurrences, another many bad surprises virus brings. hate much true. We've essentially delegated ton parenting process government. going herd immunity. far less videos situation USA? videos people drop death US. overran hospital videos. remember plenty China started. I’m sure number three won’t come through. thinks he’s gonna lose, might quit. worst thing world “loser”. Quitter though, bad. quit time “business” career. Either quits, removed election extraordinary means. ok? Current numbers mean much. USA Brazil get many dead, whereas instance Italy control.

We really know many people kill country let run amok years. official government policy, right top, ""Ignore problem goes away"", completely predictable inevitable.

And going keep getting worse worse. Anyone thinks election going decided COVID delusional. confirm one NFL team New York $11,000 turned inflammation cartilage ribs--totally harmless uncomfortable, thought heart-related rushed ER. Blood test, EKG chest x-ray later (maybe 3 hours total) kicked told life-threatening, go regular doctor Monday morning (it Friday evening) they'll tell what's wrong me.  


$11,000 got bill bruises one arms (they volunteer firefighter learning draw blood try already difficult veins, tried failed much later bruising wrist way armpit...he eventually gave up, apologized profusely begged one nurses it--even nurse, trying arm, took 3 tries). gave zero idea wrong me, hurt breathe, nothing. ""you die Monday morning, go."" 


We're dystopian hellscape. even COVID happened. fully aware bad yet. might actively seek way fuck November goes poorly them. kinda tenant would get evicted trash house way out. anti mask generally nice guy. US one affected, it'll global economic catastrophe. EcoNomIcS PoLitIcIzEd.

You think economy run without people? 


The economy people. people die, long lasting effect economy, lost work, lost buying power, lost education etc etc etc. way longer effects job loss, especially subsidize job losses federal level. 

There economists article explain themselves. It’s politicized all, even say don’t advocate indefinite lockdown, (at time writing) makes complete economic sense. 

Sorry doesn’t play political agenda. Behind paywall, I'm pretty sure guess jist coming ""The Economist."" Gosh hope don’t decide build wall! Working EMS long have, alot harder telling family someone died dealing dead dying. Life goes everyone else, they're deal it. Yeah. That's getting army guys covid point. need unified clear coherent smart national response, instead grandpa ranty telling cold drink bleach fine stealing reselling equipment call PTSD treatment “normal reaction abnormal situation” please know says normal, professional, extremely good great human being. They're top scientists one best universitys world. Theyre already accomplished 99.9% Trialling 3 african countries too. would need report death COVID related. dear, sorry experience that. something train for, prepare for. okay okay that. 'normal' things us deal with. much strength compassion humbles me. hope support awful time, need take care too. PM time. 💗 you... serious?

Look comment chain. say we’re leaping conclusion Arizona manipulating hospitalizations responded 

“Well, subject entire point comment thread. think talking about? specify ""case fatality rate"" ""infection fatality rate"". ""rate"" simply statistic measured something else.

By second paragraph, defined rate talking Texas, number **deaths per day** 307% since June 1.

Deaths per day *is rate*. Using ""death toll"" *not accurate* scenario, death toll total. much concerned death *toll* quadrupled blue, opposed go deaths per day rate.

This article understands exactly rate is. don't. Greatest country earth... used believe that.   Wait election. Hate think what’s next COVID fixed. Monday warning. Wonder bozo plans spare 35million doses population. I’d like think we’ll use refugees people fled countries origin think know he’ll flogging all. 900$ says voted Trump GOP. Sad every action equal opposite reaction. One always adjust population. US nearly 500 times worse South Korea. That's difference competency priorities Korean government vs US government. America dead. Please let first. Living Texas driving point nervous breakdown. already constant protests...

The government fucking care. point government respond people. point personally profit power, influence connections. EXACTLY ENTIRE WORLD laughs us. Summary: Positive immune response demonstrated study, saline placebo used establish safety. excuse using saline placebo rather contrived: “Participants randomly assigned (1:1) receive either ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine MenACWY vaccine. MenACWY used comparator vaccine maintain blinding participants experienced local systemic reactions, since  reactions  known association viral vector vaccinations. Use saline placebo would risk unblinding participants notable reactions would know ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine group.” could tell participants well getting either ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine MenACWY vaccine, still use actual placebo. seems researchers dishonest here. Can't learn dead.

Edit: people start shaking fingers me, here's link: here's important part: ... Children younger 10 transmit others much less often adults do, risk zero. ages 10 19 spread virus least well adults do.

So going get take home families. thinking thing. biggest premature celebration decade.

No vaccine. Alright. Continue listen echo chamber affirmation. Paywall “Ooh! Facts scary me!!!”

I know folks taking precautions.    
Not everyone every community same. Maybe I’m big ol’ pessimist anymore. :( Immigrant living America here. F Americans hell bent “freedom”. Like, mention off, lockdown response centralized government. half-measures taken, strict, true quarantine whole country (even areas without surge cases). could go necessities (food meds). couldn’t really even drive anywhere hell it, moving outside area forbidden.

This never accepted here. Aside current administration poor handling pandemic, local authorities wouldn’t enforce this. Governors vocal neighbors, shop owners media would cry tyranny. Assuming government would pay bills, mortgage/rent, expenses 6 months, still picture folks/media saying “give liberty give death” meet asinine reasons. worth noting sober mind. Even totally believable sober person would America  You, today: think even possible COVID-19 reach 10 million deaths worldwide. think final number deaths around 1.3 million so.

You, [four months COVID-19 likely kill hundred thousands.


What makes better estimator today?  deadly modern healthcare. that's overwhelmed become much deadly. doubt Spanish flu would've half percent either power literally suck blood patients body, oxygenate pump back let alone basic antibiotics, anti-inflamitories, oxygen masks anyone needs it. Also insurance companies literally don’t care get sick. don’t care healthy, either. care money

You're half right this. care money, also care get sick. healthy means insurance company makes money. want healthy, altruistic reasons. Healthy people make less claims means money them. Good news\~\~\~!!! Tested positive wasnt ill  friend mine always used say: ""don't attribute malice may attributed stupidity"". Good luck staffing them, healthcare workers getting sick dying too, wear fucking mask stay home! several different vaccines, purpose one doesnt work fall back assuming death rate stay same, death rate accurate COVID direct cause death cases. anyone would prescribe crude methods support wild unfounded theories would, fact, ""fucking stupid"".

go ahead remind millions americans dead COVID. even million deaths worldwide. seriously, i'll waiting. smug want, know actually care anything else besides right.

It’s sickening. Dude sure wasnt scam? bunch fake testing sites popping charging 200-300 found scams Dr Oz nationally syndicated show broadcasts major networks across fucking US you’re going sit tell Swami yoga treat dengue straw broke camels back you? think people talk like properly consider risk/benefit analysis rushing vaccine, judge status quo mainly form perspective may bad. thing nightmare end quickly, predict huge spike suicides coming months even years. seen aa ""side effect"" nothing weighted side effects vaccines.

Well work people actually it. yeah get point, relying people right smart thing receipt failure current society. think one needs develop critical thinking skills. mask order protection, control forcing views. private businesses every right enact policy kick store wear mask. anti-mask idiots never get head around pointless argue anyway.

nobody australia really wearing masks Thanks mate, I'm actually British :) I've moved around lot lived Australia while, bad system too, although bad American system (Aussie system mix, private health care limited public cover, meaning pay crazy amounts private health care covers next nothing need wisdom teeth pulled doc reasons end paying 3k AUD, top 100 AUD per month healthcare haha course, isn’t saying count them. virus isn’t severe everyone, shouldn’t use case count alone determine well system performing. Wow, really told me! recall anyone inviting opinion either. course also recognize platform literally everyone air unsolicited opinions I'm losing sleep it. mind comments could backstory privatising attempts. let's clarify first: no. Privatisation better NHS.

Coming another country similar health system, common problems economy gurus trying undervaluate lower selling price.

Public health commodity sickness good investment country. also extremely interesting private company, receive money cure sick people. prolonged treatment means private company's receive money time. lead worse service, beds per hospital, sick people, money spent private profits.

...

NHS good could better (same system European countries). Complaining something get something better bad. There's lot resources, personal conditions improve. Starting NHS stuff salaries. Continuing amount nurses per patient, waiting times... on.

I'm saying bad, could better NHS workers patients. understand 2-10mm number coming from. zero scientific reason believe likely happen, I'm saying. 

What I'm arguing cost buying time shutting economy HIGH. country already shut squandered opportunity. want fix mean pay cost whatsoever, make sense either. could several years vaccine. Surely can't shut several years. afford two months! 

Choosing shut economy ""fixing [nothing]"". plenty options managing thing require shut down. 

Now, again, actually provide financial assistance, different conversation. LOWERING cost buying time. that, cost high need pursue avenues mitigating threat. 

I arguing thing bad get worse. arguing can't afford shut down. can't. saying math favor pandemic numbers. Fine. math definitely favor shut down. guess world keeps going watching great country fall knees crazy politicians. bad unclear effective vaccine be, it’s good start works. Got disagree there. It’s printed tabloid format it’s leagues ahead genuine tabloids. It’s content broadsheet nature. Well, yes no:

""Americans pay 2.9% 7.25% price goods buy majority states. states, however, levy sales tax whatsoever. average, across states, sales taxes actually account larger share total revenue either property individual income tax.""

I understand VAT expensive, think it, bad Americans sales tax taxes too. Add fact get prescription US healthcare cover, paying pocket, whereas EU countries covered, I'd say extra cost VAT worth? That’s spicy meatball That's fair. probably gotten tragedy dick measuring contest. Typical Yeehaw state ya. No, deaths take additional time like 1-4 weeks occur getting infected. Florida Man's 2020 Greatest Hits gonna one hell album. :\\  vaccines administered means nasal spray orally? Yeah, know much guy, last paragraph coming gentleman. kind embargo it...can call Uighur Sanction..? Dude polls terrible job he's dealing virus. think there's motive behind he's nothing incompetent. trying punish anyone destroying chances remain president. Let's hope true.  ""consevatives"" actually fiscal conservatives US would universal healthcare wide reaching social programs decades. [the US spends twice much healthcare UK worse absolute best economic stimulus possibly provide give money straight offshore bank accounts corporations give people otherwise spend money all, every dollar give poor person goes directly back economy. I'm sorry, put like morbid. Wow. pay choice unaware get free? horrible situations course. ask I've 3 providers covered talking friends flu season (I tend one encourages everyone get it) find able get free, even shitty insurance (their words).

It makes sense think well. Insurance companies want get sick. want keep paying money never cashing one best ways preventative care vaccine. Based name alone, certainly could like communicable disease try limit spread surveillance TTI aim letting spread control order avoid necessity wide-spread lockdowns.

Just like Cholera 19th century. Keep going Fauci! ashamed many young people take seriously. need fairness doctrine back. People simply stupid figure shit out. forget fees. pay assload fees well.  Everything medical copays school book fees. 

Honestly, America kind sucks unless wealthy Lmao like every major newspaper promotes drinking Kambucha cleanse colon. USA print 360 BILLION dollars, let's say inflation would greatly accelerated.

If true, it’s possible future disease also people infected kids (who naturally get mild infection) followed milder repeat infections adults. pure speculation, something people study coronaviruses think possible. kind complications? Spreading bullshit anti US comments online. 

Looking history pro China guy/bot. Oh U.S.A... make shake head slowly every day (this year) Oh dear god. Yes, read article. saying ""having memory goldfish"" reference idea 3 second memory. proven incorrect scientists. still well known saying. been? reason lie matter. lied, bottom line, told people masks effective avoid PPE shortage.

Godspeed Spiderman exactly plan eating without removing masks??? No, really not.

Again, comments like serve reveal unqualified laypeople make determinations. 

T-cell driven immunity means articles antibodies fading suggesting reinfection frankly fear mongering capitalizing (frankly) stupid americans science behind unless literally work medical science. 

Learn quality testing progression symptoms bit ""not all"", understand likely reported potential reinfections actually false negative tests bookended correct positive tests. people take LOOOONG time clear virus completely, people re-develop symptoms test positive ASSUME would tested negative felt fine despite NEVER actually testing negative two positive tests.

If reinfection true concern, would see large-scale consensus places like Sweden Brazil, countries worse job trying control (in Sweden's case design, point remains - Sweden prime territory evidence reinfection possible, since TRYING herd immunity. seeing reinfection. 

Again, trying ignore facts reality try fit outcome wish force -that must reopen hope theraputic vaccine within 5 years. stop trying push agenda look data. fucked sure. dude nuclear grade piece dog shit. Calm waters makes bad sailors sites active betting lines this?

I would much bet it.

Willing 1,000$ less 1 million peoople vaccinated working covid vaccine 2021 case, next one personally added prayers, right now. 

Keep hanging there. time thought I'd never feel afraid again, get it. quarantine herself. going normal live spreading virus whole point. It’s possible meathead doctors don’t want corona therefore give different diagnosis?

It sounds really conspiratory, guess drink coffee first too, Florida imagine would difficult take photos hospital though, HIPAA. work mental health can't even acknowledge person goes clinic without signed release information form point b simply true. people cannot vaccinated rely general population vaccinated. look anyone refuses get kids vaccinated measles mumps asshole danger society. Yes. Zika virus. working vaccine virus fizzled out. tiny virology brain  im fairly sure decided moving austin. callans ready go well bet schaub would move stay tight rogan circle. besides three dont see anyone else going low level comics want get rogan shine around him. feel sorry citizens. 30 weeks.

With second easier see subtle signs labor approaching. first 28 weeks. long continual process next 4 cervix slowly thinning shortening. first, one tracking small changes cervix 4 weeks. second obvious. It’s anything wrong - whole process working exactly - 10 weeks soon.

I read article - hunch either lower pollution less exposure random viruses/illnesses.

What learned experience doctors idea preterm labor happens. hope get past 30 weeks anyway can, even evidence anything works (other progesterone shots, suspect bought 2 weeks).

You didn’t come insensitive. people post did, didn’t. good deed They’re actually already producing plan billions doses ready vaccine Yup, knew dummy. honestly can't say hated dude Pandemic, I'm definitely alright fucking clean time up. Florida Man born Florida Man... Sadly, deaths lag cases ~20 days shit, moronic fuckwad  old days vaccine makers would test themselves. going HUNDREDS teachers die covid fall open schools (elementary - college) back states don’t lock stop virus spread. It’s sad state affairs... don’t need walls banned every country earth. Dude. Don’t worry thought literally donut commemorate 0 cases. Idk thinking. Yup. medical field typically votes conservative good luck enlisting hoax. think big deal company lied NYT journalists. China know NYT is. real point contend ""forced labor"". course unfortunate people forced leave home move new environment new life. know, option infinitely worse. 

The long lasting problem southern Xinjiang Uighur population circle poverty, poor education resource extreme Islam. religious leaders (from local area outside China) control people think live lives. People options skill, like speaking official language, find job outside local circle. Women jobs children sent normal schools, grow become parents, unemployed seeking religious relief extreme poverty, even became terrorists. CCP (forcefully) move people outside vicious cycle, send kids normal schools give adults jobs. sweatshop sometimes far away home get paid opportunity earn better life, kids education never accessible them. looks like better life trapped decades. Also, important countries know dealing help explain US high numbers. government taking seriously. incredibly wishful kind policy logistics vaccination priority already underway, must say. Sorry blunt realise September six weeks away? Even one vaccines already production turn work, realistic pathway mass vaccination country end year. Get grip people, coming someone background logistics (just one many parts operation) nightmare take many many months better part year get need be. Hm, dangerous path, especially US large well educated population. really explain that? either even get shot say vaccinated start ignoring rules. Social distancing better efficiency 50%. Well economic fallout going massive unless US Federal Government steps up, apparently still right page right so... God forbid intelligent black woman “defy” privileged white male criminal asshole, Kemp. Defy?!?! Reminiscent Sheriff Clark, Kemp’s slave-master patois reeks yearned-for old slave-state south. that’s missing whips, chains cross burnings. Kemp thinks get away anything prison cell awaits him. bug last winter became insane right international work. sick since pneumonia high school. walk stairs condo without stopping gasping wheezing. coughed whole body ached. Fever, raging headache, exhaustion. 3 weeks peeled sofa could get back work, came home needed nap weeks. 

If Covid 19, want know is. Partner never even got cold though. Nah, MERS SARS 1 vaccines worked great, tons antibodies, even neutralizing. tested phase 3 bc outbreaks died out. mean nothing open, people tend anyways. close everything grocery stores, pharmacies, hospitals, anything heavily essential. eventually people stay home chill.  comes November, Trump take credit proclaim savior America. guarantee it. worry. one wants middle class live anyway.

Fuck people without 6 digit incomes. totally sarcasm anyway. :3 would best birthday present ever! Shut up. garbage. recent vaccines awful side effects COVID vaccine wouldn’t worth it? disease killing thousands ruining country. side effects would astoundingly prevalent awful justify delaying vaccine. absolutely baffles me. makes wonder inconsiderate ~40% population is. 

First all, believe teachers “are giving students,” it’s capable type behavior. People say stuff like usually ones would act way situation. Every damn teacher know cares students anything.

Also, mindset many people replaceable immoral wrong. People aren’t replaceable. Even heartless bastard felt way, people aren’t replaceable jobs like that.  would foolish Trump

Unfortunately something foolish likely Trump exactly that. think nobody taking obesity epidemic? 

I get vaccine scary need throw around BS like that. ""Sugar bad"" drilled brains decade.  that's hilarious. wife, feel this.

I'm heavily pregnant home day toddler. can't even go walks kid decides make run it, physically able catch her. there's lot TV yard time, browsing phone news sites, social media, etc. \*lot\* stories pregnant women catching COVID-19. I'm frustrated I'm part, often choice. 

My husband working, essential low risk job, feel life essentially unchanged. wants go shopping whatever, pop work.

There's huge dissonance perceive what's going on. lot cases area, keep freaking media's good that, he's seeing life normal + mask wearing + extra hand sanitizer. Yes, divorce crossed mind, going actual work exhausting.

EDIT: marriage great, thanks. I'm sympathizing stress anxiety couples feel get wildly different views what's going world. phase 1 findings, kinda know report. Basically showed cells immune response want. smarter people make sense it. I'm one lucky ones able mostly work exclusively home. go office need fill someone past...I know, month half so, needed lot talk longer able work home. people know similar boat. 

I mention though one states currently trending downwards, though, result firmer leadership pandemic. that, well many states currently becoming exponentially worse, local government hurry go back working person. bet talking someone one worsening states (like cousin lives Texas) example, might tell already push least employers end work home. dude, DEATH side effect COVID. that’s whole point trying get across can’t find definitive numbers (since likely don’t exist), odds Pandemrix leading narcolepsy less 0.005% everything find. Personally, I’ll still take odds a) vaccine probably safe b) it’s odds affecting stupid low global pandemic. 

Source: It’s revealed numbers inflated. rate, Plandemic never end. IQ showing. 3 points it. I'd say product that's intended nearly half billion people qualifies widely distributed. 

It's unfortunate countries want acknowledge seriousness virus probably first receive it. likely less due trying stop spread due companies recouping investments wealthy nation's distributing less wealthy nations. 12 days (also Florida) still results. Going trip eating buffet They're currently recruiting challenge studies, alongside Phase 3 lol, idea schools cannot masks show mouth ready school starting joke. Schools simplying nothing prepare working damn thing. Schools working together try masks figure least restrictive, still effective children. going open, let explode, emergency close go back online. damn thing make safe open.  people aged 18-40 really care virus all, mostly elderly affected, think completely fine. Mask compliance weird, mean 75% people wearing masks, people remove away enforcement's sights feel like ( seen people remove coughing, sneezing, talking shopkeeper, talking children, also seen lot people hugging nice, virus care all)

The average Indian pro-science (believes homeopathy, astrology, COVID man-made), wear masks fine enough deterrent make wear mask. lot super spreading events people rioting quietens itself.

Cases rising insanely fast, hit 1 mil, 30k daily cases 40k daily cases week, yet people really stirred all. People thinking cases rising increased testing capacity

It's absolute shit-show  doesn’t kill anyone 60, let alone 25 seeing less deadly strain expecting massive shitstorm 2-3 weeks? Florida man fights gator eats coronavirus breakfast  Saw nudge Cuba. “It’s *their* problem now!” Nobody's forcing interact them, wear mask, take precautions.

No, I'm not. appealing government holds monopoly violence, thinking they've authority dish desires. fact, likely ever right. Sars-2-Cov probably enter normal circulation indefinitely. example 1968 Hong Kong influenza strain still circulation part regular season flu. Also forget people service jobs grocery store around anti-masker Karens day. **The “Security Dilemma” US-China Relations**

A longstanding analytical framework popular international relations theorists “security dilemma” first formulated John Herz (Herz 1950). Security dilemma theory regards conflicts states essentially arising failures communication, wherein one side fails consider actions might viewed vantage point side. task one ‘imaginative empathy’ – attempt see effects actions eyes party. Conflict avoidance states involves recognition understanding state’s motivations intentions, without necessarily agreeing them. trajectory Sino-US relations recent decades, Americans suffered informational deficit regard. Chinese side increasingly cognizant Americans view global role rise China, whereas American side failed understand China’s complicated perceptions US behavior. American blindness complex changing realities China’s advancement world order increasingly put US disadvantage negotiations cooperation. poker player gain advantage see cards opposing player’s hands, China able second-guess outmaneuver US, equipped greater awareness side’s default assumptions, misapprehensions prejudices.

 

The degree understanding necessary deescalate current crisis create stable relationship requires informed leadership, greater mutual understanding grass-roots level, well. particularly true US, quality leadership directly correlated enlightenment voters. Raising level awareness would entail greater people-to-people contact, cooperation constructive discourse. long Chinese remain cognizant America’s media, memes, mindsets, US continues see China set outmoded tropes, tensions continue escalate. Perhaps lesson Americans move forward century start talking less listening more.

Cases 6000 last Sunday; deaths several hundred. That’s probably right. could see us peak likely plateau cases southern states done things probably enough knock ton (but enough halt exponential growth). Deaths lagging therefore still increasing, continue another couple weeks Yes, really believe immune COVID hold key finding vaccine. don’t think republicans that. think inside job. supermajority Teddy died. Look votes, R 39 House against. 60D for, 39R Senate.

I agree general, specifically ACA written well passed parliamentary tricks. agree though, it’s attacked.

E: Go back look passed, means downvote still, least realize bill passed votes. Quick, save points evolve it! shit man. want good news  appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* agree. need end unfair advantages college acceptance. Applications given random alpha-numeric names ranked computer based gpa, test scores, hours spent extra circulars, etc. idk, someone smart enough make program blindly rank applicants objectively. big question long vaccine would last. Right seeing 40 days, 1% Covid recovered patients still enough antibodies confer immunity. That's bad news. question whether memory B cells (that make antibodies) kick fast enough prevent recurring symptoms. Anyone info this? 

Here's link study I'm referencing legal stuff locally, live stream shit calms throw fucking party. Yes, large portion national leadership sudden change course seriousness pandemic may seem inconsistent. However say let Democrats pay placebo vaccine. invigorate base 'right' also ensure money redirected help public. others said, increasing evidence even cloth masks substantially reduce chance infection. Exactly. 2 different vaccines combined stage/phase 2+3 trials ~~right meow~~ starting end July. different. I’m sure you’re casting lockdown notion careless towards essential workers. would argue every day refuse lock areas need it, put workers risk. stay open avoid major catastrophic collapse either way. Locking would reduce spread virus fastest help keep essential workers safer continue let virus run rampant. say mostly American issue, western countries taken care people better even UK still well. one rushing get back work, I’ve seen heard anyways. got article observation herd immunity could reached 20% population carrying corona antibodies. Therefore, brothers right actually sacrificing health benefit wear masks contract covid. Survivors need reach 20% population may safe. big thanks bros.... honestly need enforce full lockdown across nation. 

Honeslty, mean lockdown like China. Anyone working 'essential' magically gone.  Happy marriages end divorce.

No end funerals. Well makes feel better reasonably skeptical posts like always downvoted? many vaccine investors here? pandemic either made destroyed relationships. boyfriend stronger ever three years yet mom stepdad getting divorce. (For many reasons aside pandemic).

Edit: Also, reinfection extremely rare far know, perhaps nonexistent. Contagious, symptomatic reinfection proven exist all. Except places/people America think political wear masks social distance. Unless changes, flu cases high usual. Nobody tell Sting things listed fairly minor serious issues 50 years ago. lot changed since then. Remember infection numbers soar 

It already soared since weeks ago. Honestly, don’t see things better then. cancel we’ll cancel whole thing, already legally married, official ceremony family/friends.  Could less deaths less people got Eh, Abbott number, he’s sharing. admitting wrong looked upon bad them? real man admit mistake guess real men. Source? Remember thing gonna “go away” summer Florida 8th highest population density country?? he'll 4?

Push mess bed say,

""My room's clean **don't** look bed *I said so*!"" ?


That's cute first time, disrespectful second time, downright disgusting third time on. Corona Test-Track know anyone would willingly travel remaining countries still taking US travelers. Imagine irresponsible people pandemic funneled countries. father two age, feel you. sound like lot strong dad kids. Maybe ex come around sees bad could get guys could get out. Stay strong...thinking you. enough manpower test, almost never go 10k point backlog pile up... Corona says ""hold beer"" Honestly, I’m trying contrary, grasp logistics involved. Getting government trace vaccinate 400 million people span 3 4 months ridiculous proposition. start process early September, happy presume be, I’m worried false expectations. crisis won’t well 2021. Idk, lot conspiracy “bill gates vaccine” long it’s one reckon get vaccinated. really common sense thing go do. fear daily infection number reach 20000 per day

It's likely already there. randomized testing, there's real way estimate daily prevalence. test results that's poor means estimate prevalence. Would surprised 20,000 per day Florida.

On plus side, sustain daily new infection rate 20,000 constantly, would achieve herd immunity 2.37 years. point number cases would naturally decline even without lockdowns masks. process would approx. 173,000 excess deaths state approx. 3,470,000 FL residents would suffer form long term lung and/or neurological damage.

And that's assuming health care system able keep infection rate indefinitely never run ICU beds, ventilators, anything else needed care critical patients. I'm suicidal I'm thinking going Florida really? We’ve never vaccinated everyone earth disease before. It’s never done history earth we’ve global pandemics before. 


Wouldn’t make sense hand there’s small outbreaks certain areas? That's lot closer actually workable solution anything I've heard anyone else bring up. would great babysitters capable helping kids kids get stuck schoolwork, too. Finding many qualified babysitters willing take risk short period time schools due reopen fall would expensive difficult undertaking, think would worth effort make sure situation works well everyone possible. interesting see actually happens. ""[Once virus inside cell, sets shop, replicating speed. Imagine photocopying viral manuscript, Vasan says copy used make next. long, mistakes – smudges missing letters – start creep in. typos known mutations. slow virus dropped text time. silent – don’t affect virus’s structure function – still understand sentences. rarer mistakes, ones improve We'll see. appears company question made ""commitment"" provide 400 million vaccines end 2020. would presume means they're going lose money agreement meet commitment. girl love currently Arkansas hate it... we’ve reduced maybe 30-40. We’ve taken many precautions can. Temper check front, buffet style, everyone/table split up, masks.

My biggest concern people traveling wanting explore Little Rock. even listen protests asking police stop murdering us think petition help? honestly admire still hope. let die, I'm serious. live canada hoping start human trials ""fall 2020"" depending trials go I'd imagine near end year beginning 2021 that's Canada would looking vaccine. that's trials go good take time develop further. promoted head Health Human Services. I'm tired winning. mass protests helping. didn’t think he’d See? kinds people deserve statues. ones torn stay down. vaccine complain need most.. Crazy. got 2 hour result ER New York. people die mostly elderly, contribute less economy. Spending money earned lifetime also done heirs. source this? I’d like show annoying non-believers. Assuming, course, *re-*infection rare. not, they'll never rid it. wonder fraction public refuse get vaccinated time comes, sheer blockheadedness. publication call 'newspaper' civilised part world.

A Corona fan boy human repeating fake news regarding Corona. fast food paid prepared meal delivery services. Seems China keep (some) people issue warnings quiet, US simply don’t listen people. sure sucks sooo many people country refuse vaccine anyways pass another trillion dollar bill yeah Wow, serious wanting leave? think wanna go? try make sure rebound - rushing fast next relationship type thing. mean, I'm grateful living am, hear people talk Canada like heaven earth that's realistic. Mind you, guess relative. 

I know, often thought - whole world gotten together, locked everything down, might seen end this. no. journalists make living too? What? can't live $1200 six months? problem weak public health toolkit.

Pandemic response broadly divided two halves: medical technology public health.

Medical technology effective therapeutics rapid vaccine development. EU good this, US even better. That's see ""which country ready pandemic"" list pre-COVID-19 often see US listed top.

But fast moving novel pathogen, medial technology means shit. things doctors try save lives, there's nothing doctors strangle spread virus itself, people that.

The half pandemic response public health measure. stuff terms changing society operates reduce transmission rate. absence effective medial technology counter outbreak (both case, well past pandemics, say Black Death) public health becomes lone effective measure.

For reason western countries dismiss public health measures, maybe they've become reliant advancement medical technology past bail trouble, already painfully evident Swine Flu outbreak 2009. Seems like western countries let public health toolkit atrophy degree tool left closing schools, they're reluctant hell even employ that.

Compared country well outbreak strong public health toolkit employ cut transmission. ah, want die, want die lose business...cause shit stains long process make people money. method could costly basically requires people invest later steps prior steps validated (meaning waste ton vaccine candidate fails one stage), nobody getting rich alternative. think cynicism misplaced.

And there’s less data fast track. sample sizes adequate step (phase three trials thousands participants, example), time variable seems appropriate given likely side effects may materialize. We’ll lot useful data phase three trials shortly, unless red flags pop I’m comfortable process. Media factor causing asymmetry. much easier Chinese people move, learn, work integrate US society reverse. Getting work residency permits China difficult Americans. Foreigners can't even stay hotels, even get bank accounts.

Heck, even marrying Chinese spouse confer work status.

China makes extremely difficult foreigners live work there. correct answer. think Sept start mass producing. think produce enough make available general population early next year. course VIP's, millionaires etc. jumping queue.  smallpox, we're close eradicating polio. largely present Pakistan Afghanistan now, rare cases pop elsewhere every while. direct result shows vaccination important.

Additionally, we're working eradicating guinea worms, parasite Jimmy Carter's foundation focusing on. cases dropped **very significatly** past decades, recently found dogs serve reservoir species. So, looks like really possible eradicate parasite, since treatment uses physically pulling worms skin instead drugs. However, large decrease cases shows hope managed education sanitation Teachers maybe? Teachers definitely. God I’m tired lack respect teachers. directed towards you. Emotions hard words. Thanks, I'm also looking argument either we're good. appreciate expressing opinion. I'll honest I've completely come distrust government. trust judgement, trust authority definitely trust ideologies. That's probably biggest hangup here. believe people removing government remove everyone's ability make things happen successfully, believe that's different topic together. like said everyone's safety. help gripe idea forced inject foreign chemical trust healthy me. something want rush though, honestly. Thanks time. ☺️ quick question: plays nearly ideally, would mean Covid dangers could eradicated 2021 (or maybe early 2021)? Would mostly-normal return life possible?  I'm seriously considering finishing degrees becoming Canadian. would want still go normal court proceedings like criminal. think also get really good therapy jail get help needs live semblance normal life. Otherwise ends cycle committing crimes. think people believe we'll able get done October, many logistical reasons. vaccine available, it'll likely months everyone able get vaccinated. That's reasonable expected. meantime, infection going population gets vaccinated. people can't get ICU bed ICU full Covid patients... etc... okay, die Covid Covid taken local ER/ ICU might still alive.

So person bad Covid goes hospital, full fire injury patients doesnt get bed dies ...

.. say fire cause death? even would say ""I urge Americans part wear masks"" without legal backing, would've much better... really feel people like you, must really frustrating. would that. even people changed mind would worth it. people read think “I still won’t wear mask”. god feel, you. don’t want people die also shutdown utah again, friends lose business sure second time around what? It’s fucking terrifyingly “The vaccine produced Oxford ... basically Cambridge ... second greatest university USA (after Wharton) Harvard ... American ingenuity leadership saved us all!” Sweden volunteered test case try different way. way illness deaths per capita neighbors. economy shitty. writing wall - staying open spare economy. closing spare lives. get vaccinated flu every year, naive think administration try push vaccine irrelevant safety efficacy (preferably close election day possible.)

Now, EU says vaccine safe, I'll take it, trust US government pretty low right now. Don’t get rough timeline 5 days infection symptoms, 7 days symptoms hospitalization, 5-7 days hospitalization ICU.

I'm expert, put together based number naritives. Never knew that!! Thanks tip!! God money.  Call get stage 3.

Every fucking vaccine gets stage 1. They're optimistic.

They've still never made vaccine corona virus. know he’s doing, doesn’t mean people aren’t traveling assumption they’ll able skip quarantine.  !RemindMe 2 weeks  idea, seems like lot posts vote manipulated here. Probably trying keep info hard find large chunk turn away icu patients. side official florida data trust low since fired health director refused inconsistently report data also dont know manipulated. oh god please please please .. dunno that, get fired administration never disagree Dear Leader willing break law wants to. never stop nodding head, tell ideas good leadership excellent, never original thought stay within party lines golden. look Ron DeathSentence Florida. ran promising sockpuppet governor that's exactly got.

And we're Great :)



/s didn’t that. Read carefully? Don’t forget DeathSantis! 
-Fellow Floridian It'll held another month Trump want signature every syringe Everyone know unemployment treating like paid vacation is, spending like crazy absolutely refuse return work (where they’ll take pay cut) even it’s safe. anti vaxxer fast vaccine rushed pushed society pretty damn alarming. thinking yourself- two way street.

Actually, no. one way street assholes going wrong way because, ""FREEDOM!"" Associate Home Depot here. assure many customers come LOOK like adults, act like spoiled tantrum throwing children. imagine trying ask put masks. experience, I’ve tried. throw hissy fits even state law requires it. 40% effectiveness COVID vaccine would 40% effective current situation COVID vaccine. Huh? tests processed. yes samples taken week ago. Protestors tearing statues qualifies following rules. Maybe time new rules since old rules followed?  guy gets fast pass heavenly gates.  tested positive Friday, occasional mild chest tightness freaks man A) Money man-made. mean don’t money? literally print it. plenty models shown US capable providing level support citizens without collapsing dollar. welcome disagree, disagreement based facts intuition. 

B) implying half world already infected Covid? There’s already 600k deaths confirmed virus. *think* 1.3 million world’s final death count? 

You’re welcome *think* anything want, it’s backed anything it’s worthless invalid. say “I think cancer doesn’t exist. That’s opinion.” I’d fucking idiot saying it, I’m still welcome say it. That's true. lie There's weekly twitter thread cdc mortality numbers revisions account reporting lags. think visualizations looking usually included, well breakdowns several individual states. scroll quite bit his, uh, idiosyncratic politics though... Forgot mention actually do. 100m 65m people...? Plus there's good Karen's anti vaxxers Well, starters, ultra-dense cities mean much considering entire state. Miami flats 1600 sq ft NYC flats 800 sq ft, going make quite big difference as, say, retirement homes vs farmland.

Isn't funny population density Florida mentioned, decided use list cities? Almost like looked found Fl eighth densest state decided choose worse metric liked more.

Then follow wiith vague, unqualified comment like, ""uhhh *that* high *here*"".

Yeah, I'm pretty content statement dimension Floridians dense. Loose bonds unusual pressure it. Wow, thats number downvotes Ive seen yet. exactly. leadership like Brazil government ignoring problem bodies piling up, people eventually issue economy suffer. That's never understood. Unfortunately economy solving whole kids disrupting parents working home thing, parents increasingly job work at, many soon loosing homes too. OLD even know Zoomers young people now. Millennials already old. millennium 20 years ago. say jokingly, yes old fuck recently realized old actually hahahhaha. years songs oldies stations boomers die.

Get Grandpa! lol. Get right alright, people screwing country Baby Boomers Zoomers, hahaha. There's little bit sanity two, whole lot cause MOFO's DRIVING INSANE! 

why zooomers? actively work self interests, whyyyyy?? hahhahaha. Yes. Panhandle. It’s steady, manageable. *everyone* states knows someone who's died covid ... time fast approaching ... hope public rage grows exponentially death toll. incredibly sad takes, might inevitable country that's abandoned concept social responsibility completely US seems done recent decades. met anyone Canada Europe who's envious States many years now, nation's preponderance callousness main reason. boaters neither rich, scum. Maybe pay federal tax cuts? Antivaxxer alert - ignore everything said Near NYC. give fuck assure you. We're currently working two week backlog. I'm sorry, we're trying catch quickly can. groceries food? I'm Utah signed son K12 online school year. He's starting junior high think keep safe, all. Well put. 

FWIW, teacher we've speaking recently retired tutoring moment. employed district. finances difficult. families well, consider us rich. Figuring make whole thing work financially parties hard. Likely, it'll financial stretch families, still teacher worth. 

I fully trust public schools area teachers. trust feds, government, virus. People regularly act based upon hope happen disregard science. 

I can't see public school actually going work. That's intended knock teachers, know best. unrealistic ask try congregate kids middle pandemic safely. 

What think though? think actually run public school safely? deaths going down..? wish family could move. house ideal condition sell (not anyone buying right now) we're living single income. savings speak of. sucks. We're stuck school st start August 10th currently.  think issue can't blame everything mental health, otherwise every single criminal would start acting crazy moment get caught. stealing mask probably ""sane""  people know comply orders. key limiting social gatherings certain places closed events banned, people follow orders go either. wish family could move. house ideal condition sell (not anyone buying right now) we're living single income. savings speak of. sucks. We're stuck school st start August 10th currently. Beka13 correct whilst you, fact, wrong. Waaah visit Florida couple times year, unfathomable get point. culture bonkers state run idiots. Part thinks Florida, Georgia couple states governed folks inspired Thanos’ vision. But, but, but... White House ""epidemiologists"" soon saying Texan ever died coronavirus doctors lying!

I'm confused! possibly believe Texas White House President Trump (sent God) saying Texas doctors world lying hurt President's re-election... Everyone must *always* believe President, matter stupid things says are. Antifa, anarchist, anti-Christ, anti-American, Anti-Trumpists would disagree!

You one *THOSE*, you? ^(/s) Well, fortunately current administration never anything they're supposed do. paying attention? system designed allow presidential interference mean president interfere.

You guys certain force ineffective, dangerous vaccine. like people certain build wall. people certain we'd never stand concentration camps children abducted parents. people certain we'd never secret police kidnapping citizens street.

And course people right. like are. What's also laughable article write they're required take Mandarin lessons attend flag raising ceremonies, fail mention Han Chinese employees also required things well. Many people assume Chinese people speak Mandarin 1st language, farther truth. Many people provinces countryside Chinese dialects learn Mandarin 2nd language school work. absolutely makes sense factory want employees speak Mandarin that's would able communicate people job. Even McDonald's provides English lessons employees (http://www.archwaystoopportunity.com/english_under_the_arches.html). Hell, job program, Uyghurs might even hired due lack Mandarin abilities.

Honestly though really shows double standard Western media. Like hear news Federal government subsidizing job placement programs risk minority youths, people would applauding effort. Chinese government same, violation human rights, even though evidence it. Well, Garcetti agreed reopened quickly, *but blamed state county*. actually claimed little control fucking City Los Angeles did, despite mayor city.

The state county *did* open quickly, went right along it. I'm tired spineless politicians blaming everyone completely predictable consequences reopening even benchmarks met. Ghouls. Could imagine customer employee lady pulls pants starts taking piss? know would laughed cried. protests still going states? Yes, depending state certain procedures done physician sign death certificate depending state mailed filed electronically sent county coroner. helpful normal times prevent fraud things like that. unfortunately unhelpful overwhelmed physicians right now. fact CDC less involved also bad news reporting numbers. Also death rate ""that bad"" reflect fact still lot hospitalized patients ICU first go around. Last week took care someone 60 days, still knocked ventilator. count death, surely least life altering debility eventually. Source: ICU nurse covid unit.  Yeah, I'm bit dreamer like believe US kept idea independence freedom forefront decisions wars civil war world wars... know may true, beautiful thought right?

But yeah, second half 20th century beyond rollercoaster mishaps poor decisions... think choices people die calamity introduce state income taxes Florida, two assuming half Floridians would take possible death. need tourism money tax money work unlimited sick days common thing? actually understand long really takes turn ship around especially size? multitude reason masks work people wear better. Let's argue reason real reason going wear right wear all. I'll take someone wearing one tight beard vs someone without one. kept re-reading comment baffled 84k less 70k realized 84 total 84 thousand.  add ""and use term lightly"" '""elected""... NHS permanently wanting money, ungenerous symptom empire building, realistically reflection fact money always mean lives saved. Even looking figures deficit seem much, £1.2bn years back less 1% funding, means NHS spending perhaps 8.08% instead 8%. think terms comparison systems that's accounting detail.

I say NHS far perfect, think US could much effect social insurance contributory systems elsewhere Europe, would probably fit better American attitude complexity delivering care huge massively varied geographical areas. UK small geographically homogenous makes centralized system much viable opinion. winning! I'm OK still waiting results test taken 7 days ago. Masseschusetts republicans different breed republican. Don’t forget massive protests. yet still blaming people getting haircuts. know. likely February already, mit mostly asymptotic.


I suppose won’t travel long time too. Mei neighbor though....she already vacation Greece talking going vacation fall.


Not sure stupid ignorant. 


I rather stay flat take walks need rises. don’t want infect / get infected (if already hav suspect) anyone. It’s worth risk. correct especially neurotrophic rna viruses. Measles instance found patients brains decades later correlated debilitating neurological disabilities. dont think contagious, think reactivation, doesnt mean right. safer treat virus reinfected assume correct diagnosed cancer 21 years ago, strongest supporters Americans I'd met online - fellow cancer patients. One bathroom walls covered cards they'd sent me. even called hospital went surgery. never met face face, still became best friends. Keep hanging there. mean. don’t know anyone country hasn’t left country. sure it’s Texas US general, guys seem like staying  ""On way to"" would accurate...


(History 101)


Edit: grammar 101... relationship drug (described interferon beta) [Cuban interferon seems [about although looks like recent spike 15k July 12th... maybe backlog got bit unstuck? turned cat smh Info is: known yet. 

That’s again, asking really dumb questions? you’re bright? bring time machine brought great knowledge? Except pesky massive protests US pandemic. argument made US fought interests, hell, pretty good run Korea. 

It's downhill since then. idiot governor followers complete morons. Hahahahah, good one!   Similar Czech republic dont understand downvoted. spot ask bottles look like Western vaccines, immunity breaks 9 days. really cheap ANYONE SPREAD IT. went er heat exhaustion/mono every test sun including covid. Well turns 5400 er bill paid completely united health cuz covid test....go figure “Hey guys, turn TV! Let’s watch state the..”

*gets fucking fired* Fact. Coronavirus mutates. Fact Fauci failed produce HIV vaccine. Fact pitiful. legitimate right remove post. got read, google easy use  Throw kids cliff, it’s fatal, survive Ohhh, see, thanks. 

(I trying draw connection vaccines cancer treatment. ) One way flatten curve. great breakthrough means understand virus now. may confused earlier report South Korea, one early studies supposedly showed reinfection. turned that, IIRC, lungs healed began dumping ""gunk"" - including RNA fragments dead virus particles - built illness, resulting people's blood popping positive PCR tests despite actively infected. Mine never came nah. he’s definitely fucktard. hope country whole move beyond things then, difficult times, learn them. research made public, there's really reason countries percentage population covered. many facilities capability produces vaccine surely lot governments fund construction new facilities 100%. LITERALLY comes weather US wants help save humanity make money this. Unfortunately world, know they're gonna choose. Imagine that, exponential growth grows exponentially. Can't really wrong neutral statement like that. Even vaccine happens mean vaccine guaranteed, case eventuated. Alas, pernickety. neither conspiracy speculation That's right.

But English-language media reported specifically, maybe think important.

You check one, 

From Chinese. Methods approach virus? pretty much actually. Peru neighbours made similar errors. Fuck ""warning,"" close already.

Too late ""warning."" Yeah Essential daycare provide. Teachers highly overpaid daycare workers. 

/s (should obvious, sadly probably isn’t some) Yea, doesn’t make sense, unless need one shot plan vaccinate people airports. I'm talking personal opinion - that's irrelevant. I'm talking methods approach world leader. sitting across table him, involved business deal, trust him. God's waiting room too. oldies kicking good GOP voter base numbers. undeniable, also prevalent news thousands dropping dead day. back 2013 went walked bank gesticulated wanted bank card walked one 15min (Canadian white guy). sure changed. 

highly recomend going month first day get local sim card / wechat / bank account. golden rest stay others might struggle breeze tru everything. 

i know u.s tax law passed years ago american problem opening accounts doh. american clients could get legal problem (u.s law says bank give info chinese laws say cant ) something banned americans opening accounts accross board lot banks. Can't make money selling vaccines later Americans already pandemic control. Republicans already sacrificing lives lol Yea know plenty people want spend 4 years college make 35k year deal teenage bullshit day. doesn’t work someone anti communist username must bad. helped millions others though. I'm UK politics little different here, I'm finding incredibly hard understand people treating wearing masks political issue? literally save life, problem? sensible Americans provide insight find absolutely baffling  Testing germany - Share little experience seen posts USA 5hrs waiting time.

Just called doc since last week symptoms.

- get tested immidately tomorrow - Designated time protect people suggestion come 11 Clock tomorrow people - lab driver comes 11.15 expect waiting time. course need mask told (i never ever gone without mask) seems like goal pretend nothing happening. That's Oxford vaccine works. asymptomatic spread it’s right thing do. Actually right thing voluntarily travel you’re hot zone like (Florida). absolutely idea I’ll ever travel again. Anywhere. 

I’m fortunate live somewhere stunningly beautiful 12 months year plenty space get outdoors avoid people. I’m blessed whole pandemic (selfishly) made life wife kids much better. wasn’t great I’m type person works hard vacations enjoy family. Right I’m living dream! hardest part keeping daily routine structure everyday like Saturday Fine then, compare South Korea Japan Tbf construction essential good

Firstly stimulates economy keeps jobs

Secondly lot people wanted home renovations less travel roads done road work easier

Plus construction provided wear masks isnt nessecarily 'hotspot'.

A lot construction done social distance masks sometimes worn anyways hazardous spots

With proper mask wearing dont see construction bad idea? grammar indication truthfulness topic...your full shit  Europe mostly managed black death, least 1/3 population died ""economy"" time completely crashed. took 200 years population recover back level before.

I say mostly even though black death started 1346 still occasional minor outbreaks 1800s. Suffice say want happening today. get idea R0 50? good, wondering way get link dissertations...I want something read topic hours, guys triggered interest argument. disagree. managed end pandemic eight months, first case detected. Tests developed distributed less month. Vaccine developed distributed quickly. Internationally considered point. Considering ride normally like 3 hours, that’s insane! think there’s two possible reasons to. first even safe vaccine likely side effects. Give 8 billion people it’s inevitable problems unknown magnitude. issue effectiveness moderate - people likely change habits thinking immune aren’t. it’s 50% effective that’s great, everyone proceeds go around licking doorknobs, you’re worse before. Obviously exaggerating bit here..... Would nice though nature makes virus whipes people low IQ. Talking natural selection ... Sure fuck enough us do. equally disgusted amazed people's actions time. things say. laugh fuck else legitimate concern US may preparing much may ultimately lead delays vaccine distribution. That's probably Dr. Bright drawing attention to.

What seem believe simply impossible US produce otherwise acquire many syringes within reasonable time frame, makes sense. What's sadder didn't.

Maybe cliche point, impression people country terrifying every level.

I've known since high school kind stupid going death me.

I'm crossing fingers one. Please keep corona United States COVID. :-) $500 copay $2000 monthly insurance policy cost empty syringe without insurance? I'm confused. We're WA. Looking something similar though. sub narrative step line get downvoted.

Never question Sweden's handling virus

Never question possible BLM protesters spread virus, question protest condemn strongly even masked.

Never say anything negative NYC, San Francisco Chicago.

Gov. Coumo never criticized anything. 

Regardless scientists say, AOC still final word.

China cannot possibly lie anything.

It takes time, realize like illogical people right, illogical people left center etc. 

Obama years ago gave good advice, said make sure visit sites sides, think important ever. hang here, might end twisted logic spew hang right sites might end twisted logic spew there, read sides, always stick science, best available science now. please help us vote 'leaders' competent. 40 years still haven’t found vaccine hiv 5 months virus stage three vaccine. won’t hold breath. husband also got overnight results prior surgery. general public, non-hospital testing sites quite long turnaround. mean feel like true. People die time. Right people dying bit more, what's, worst million two deaths total (at WORST, 500k americans), compared economy crashing completely. 

Economy crashing completely would literally ruin lives hundreds millions, whereas COVID19 ruined 0.5mil. Oh yeah, 3 groups don’t health stake decision. great round table. Jesus Christ. Tbh expected well EU, maybe bit slower due large country is. didn’t see second peak coming though. long Jobkeeper Jobseeker keep thing, think we'll right.  Hopping.  COVID, is. Let's give panic paranoia assume us infected less 5% world population COVID 19.

The correct statement ""not wearing mask public infected also endangers people around you"". Agreed. instead she’ll get ridiculed globally jail it, likely never receive help needs.  ""~~Harmless~~""

""Mostly Harmless"" -- Ford Prefect little both, imagine  Interesting. actual RCT.  looked “golden calf” I’m still really confused. know calves perfect?

^^But ^^seriously, ^^wtf ^^is ^^a ^^Golden ^^Calf worries shut flattened curve Australia. eased restrictions opened shops. large outbreaks Melbourne gone back lock least 6 weeks

I need clarify here; rolling lockdowns based ICU load case numbers expectation - plan - medical science side things Aus since March. government balls tell everyone.

Note page 15 (and diagram page 12) 16/03/2020 Imperial College Covid-19 report #9: avoid rebound transmission, policies need maintained large stocks vaccine available immunise population – could 18 months more. Adaptive hospital surveillance-based triggers switching population-wide social distancing school closure offer greater robustness uncertainty fixed duration interventions adapted regional use (e.g. state level US). Given local epidemics perfectly synchronised, local policies also efficient achieve comparable levels suppression national policies force slightly smaller proportion time. However, weestimate national GB policy, social distancing would need force least 2/3 time (for R0=2.4, see Table 4) vaccine plan. Governments (including Aus) scared people (and markets) react ""lockdown 2/3 potentially next 18 months"". test yesterday, woke negative result morning. *Going eat friends. Concerts. Sports games.* 

Ive never done it. :D Good actually surprised learn that. drove Jacksonville Tallahassee college literally nothing entire width state. guess concentrated places like Miami Tampa. Martial law overrides Constitution.

which agenda november. Well destroys plan. furloughed. working minimal part time hours. income comes unemployment. Pandemic unemployment ends soon. bet water softener new dishwasher wait later. double check w/ Gavin Newsom's new rules.

pretty sure gets ruled county 'on list'. schools closed. education system don’t work America. Don’t blame people. 

Gotta take step back reassess, friend can't even imagine kind horrors women children experienced Xinjiang concentration camps. pray them.

No, same. all. Population control dumb, evidence suggests 2100 human population somewhere 1/2 2/3 population today.

There's open mouth coughing, people cough inside arm covering whole face.

Numbers active cases italy going day day, hope ends well soon everyone.  technically 2/3 9/11 every day, 3,000 people died attacks (not counting first responders ended health issues), still using analogy months ago, peak NYC alone experiencing 9/11 worth deaths every 2 days so. Damn. Wifey surgery Spain, PCR test done negative confirmed 1,5 hours. includes messenger take test main hospital lab. free ofc. It’s already destroyed. it’s get worse. 

But everything get better ❤️  stock market economy modern golden calves. Health valued America like countries, there's explanation people reckless stupid health, health others. virus entirely go away soon. Even vaccine widely distributed still antivaxxers, people actual health complications preventing getting COVID treatments, children born, somewhat isolated/undocumented populations. ""warp-speed"" vaccines definitely 100% effective last long since impossible long-term trials without spending years prove work. vaccine distributed 2020 effectively clinical trial see effective long last. solid, all-encompassing vaccine likely distributed learn first vaccines 2021, perform long-term trials 2022, finally make billions doses replace temporary/outright faulty vaccines fast-tracked distributed sake saving least people. 

The entire at-risk demographic continue social-distancing even decent vaccine since way garuntee 95%+ effectiveness even reliable ""expiration date"" without extensive clinical trials. It'll enough get people ages 20-50 back work maybe open schools capacity, idea virus suddenly vanish orgasmic day vaccinating, reopening rejoicing delusional. take 3+ years world go back normal idea societal normalcy redefined forever. sleep night guests wedding reception die COVID-19?  

Or celebrating marriage expense Americans' lives?  France enough mask march-april, french govt decided downplay importance (maybe avoid panick stupid thing do). 

Now mask, become mandatory obviously previous downplaying helping.

Hmm, food thought.  (This ended way longer meant to, sorry. started ranting couldn’t stop. Felt good let out, i’ve holding months)

I feel this. I’m disgusted too. I’ve worked really hard push back extremely misanthropic mindset teenager - early 20’s made huge strides last 3 years it’s coming back full force pandemic many people acting. Even partner’s family hitting hard travel 4th July weekend hotspot another hotspot hospitals near capacity. Like?????? family members 60 plethora heath issues including one multiple open heart surgeries belt. overweight couple work elderly population. heart patient work shutdowns decided spend time traveling back forth hotspot hotspots wearing mask. He’s complaining constantly entire life sports &amp; sports betting obviously isn’t happening rn “needs travel get mind it.” Fuckin spare me.

I’ve seen friends same. partner’s bar friends whining come bars Korean BBQ (the place indoors, tables tiny extremely close proximity). care infection rates death counts wearing mask, course. told dramatic declined they’re silent bars indoor dining got shut state.

I’m point I’m sick I’m going start cutting people off. you’re traveling pleasure wearing mask whining hard quarantine acting like pre-COVID times (going bars, parties, etc), think you’re selfish, inconsiderate probably stupid person interest socializing people anymore. 

I read someone describe pandemic looking behind curtain seeing wizard wizard oz. person much eloquent said idea really rings true me. It’s like knew people kinda selfish kinda terrible degree willing look past sake maintaining social connection. I’m it. don’t energy anymore. I’ve (literally) isolated alone many years life problem going back lifestyle again; that’s probably reason low tolerance people using isolation excuse “get back normal”. severe panic disorder like I’m sympathetic alone anxiety. it’s pathetic people can’t stay homes year, whining whinging bored 3 months using excuse whatever want right now. Pardon lack sensitivity get it. It’s greater good. Like don’t think hard spend year half, almost 2 full years life completely isolated, alone majority time dark computer, books, hour internet daily get by? year locked house myself, getting essential supplies limited contact one else? pre pandemic too. get you. I’ve tried giving people tips, life lessons learned time isolation one cares. don’t want start new hobby productive, want whine wanting go Disneyland. We’re pandemic!! fucking wait!! I’m it.

You get economies work buddy?

It's called ""stimulus"" show.
There's enough ""essential"" jobs, essential jobs one society bullies ignores.

President wants hide data open jobs back asap, friends shareholders stocks nosediving, wants economy back precovid despite fact destroy economy kill Americans.

USA USA USA School communicating you? But, where's accountability? guy fired saying ""masks work"" March. I’m ok watching movies home, titles always prefer giant screen theater sound. facts support change? honestly don’t know. insight would appreciated!   Yeah UHC parents' company they're awful. Literally thing required lengthy authorization outright denied amphetamines narcolepsy. pay cash anti depressants they're cheaper Winn Dixie discount card copay is. I've waiting 2 months new narcolepsy medicine weeks authorization medicine control tachycardia. 

Winn Dixie actually cheaper Goodrx many occasions me. absolutely ridiculous. Politicians purposefully wanting infection certain demographics, get grip. 

The political motivations anti-mask sentiments Republican constituents pressure maintain Trump's economic image. satisfaction irrelevant. We're talking gathering information make informed decisions impact health well-being millions. lease, rushing headlong outcome can't walk back from. solution clearly another payment anyone makes 'X' amount income

Even this, eliminate bureacracy involved deciding upfront gets doesn't. Make check box ""I understand make so-and-so amount, repay taxes next year."" I'm fine Bill Gates getting check returning long means roll things minimal bullshit, timely manner. like coronavirus went away like miracle. Monday results back-dated corrected day two after.

Young people making private parties, street parties. want ban alcohol too? young people exercise control show empathy. goes everyone especially young people. driven summer wave. Facts facts. families catching people die think finally seeing progress restrictions. Though think we'll drop far many people still flaunting guidelines. world that's problem. Damn nice squeeze play! I'm curious works. One concerns kid interrupting sessions, already happens work video conferencing. there? one country I've heard little since started. American Football is, IMO, least safest. far close contact Basketball, although played indoors.

EDIT: Shit, forgot fact often guard one another close contact basketball, that's big knock basketball. abouts? live Santa Fe gotten bad tourists here. drinking disinfectant, mask me! USA USA USA!! nba definitely taking precautions though. players think staff get tested everyday, everyone follows rules fine. Fox sports already CGI robots. Florida, man. really feel like missed boat calling Vaccy McVaccface, I'm honest. vaccine development private first film “Dumb people” could’ve chosen hundred different combinations words situation, ones chose. irony thick. logic, would restaurants owned religious people follow health codes? I'm going Christian bakery so. Can't sort risk exposure too? got 10 people low risk symptoms much like clear batch testing.

Of course testing useless anyway changing anything. CDC far perfect, even functional, pandemic. idea forcing hospitals change reporting protocol middle massive outbreak crazy.

Taking data hands organization designed store process think another part government immediately stand better system mindbogglingly idiotic. feel same, getting sort protection group people would great. Vaccines everyone green eyes size 12 shoes? Awesome! worry partial misleading information leading risky behavior decision making. over. I'm also little leery CYA language vaccines available next year pumping AZ ready fall. process difficult it'll take year (plus COVID disruptions) spousal sponsorship PR application approved. Giant corona beer 🍺 much this. 

Nor shield government. Florida going force teachers students face-to-face classes despite fact government botched re-opening safe, better hook sued deaths result.

And yes, clearly Florida likely bankrupted thing getting money probably pipe dream. shifting cost onto families o.k. Sacrificing lives incompetence o.k. came three stages me. First really bad body aches, like pushed hard gym 6 month break. sudden onset mid grade fever (102.2-102.4) woke next morning throat feeling like broken glass really consistent dry cough. slept 20 hours day 4 days straight fever started.

Edit: girlfriend feeling better longer showing symptoms. Thanks asking! think would landslide coming someone openly anti Trump took trip Orlando became sick, Hicks said.



Do know infected anyone else?



Stop taking major trips, people! countries mostly licked this. Yeah. Hopefully translates real research (haven’t seen yet still hoping) It’s something everyone betterment society. example, everyone pays taxes, everyone obeys basic rules road etc. There’s lots things “forced” government helps make country function safely effectively. Well, pandemic bleed 2021. economic affect go beyond that. study 1918 pandemic shown states restrictive shutdown early able recover faster economically.  Florida voters may suffer longer. Maybe make connection. places great, that’s also typical movie theater offering. Still, three chains live offered service. One went bankrupt, bankruptcy third locations suburbia far away. *before* pandemic. landlords people extra room house

There quite difference spare room spare house. getting anything else thread that's kind ridiculous statement. *Laughs Czech*, *Is sad you* arent gives impression ? blunt,this you.

Its not. us. still best everyone best also focus families.

People wants keep schools closed. would terrible many families. ESPECIALLY poor families parents (if even two parents home) need work pay rent.

If want keep kids home, blame you. teacher wants work, blame them. actively chose send kid school. given option online classes in-person classes chose person he's home school, lights food table... actually table put food first place.

Will get sick? Sure. die. Unfortunately, reality country right nothing reverse that. I'm going best constraints things actually control. 

Good luck everyone, apparently we're going ""Make America Great Again"".... Yeah right starting home definitely best regardless state. Living Missouri wish politicians absolute jokes. _might_ happening, bit reach assume that, wildly anecdotal. Let's presume 120 129 people downvoted (thusfar) wearing masks indoor public spaces 'mask zealots', thing even existed. promise I'm showering mask case covid comes thru walls. ;}

However, based way post, think anyone suspects making good faith argument. Nothing says Merry Christmas bunch Covid infections! assume next phases ensure actually protects COVID? really good though, side affects seem much less significant US company that’s larger group test. It’s subject (medicine, chemistry) prize worthy. awarded typically discoveries changed fields. vaccine technical achievement one changes way look medicine chemistry.

I’d say peace prize best shot...  person came knowing thinks it’s hoax know allows part, haven’t seen anybody forced. fiancée, sister, sister's boyfriend, put foot parents yesterday. Last year, planned vacation September Florida. parents asking wanted go, repeatedly dragging asking said no. Finally, fiancée respond conversation want go, they're free, going seeing 14 days get back. take vacation sister sisters boyfriend go Florida. seemed get them. 

Also, like fuck even want go Florida September anyway? live north, gonna hotter balls Florida miserable, stupid humid peninsula. go weather live hurts faces cold? happy classified properly? agree explanations, think Fox News actually primary culprit. Fox sets narrative much conservative ecosystem. They've become accustomed Trump era downplaying every story covered mainstream media makes Trump look bad, strategy largely worked terms keeping voters onboard mitigating political fallout many Trump scandals.

They successful, fact, made disastrous decision early pandemic treat mainstream media's growing concern virus (and lack federal response) another overhyped non-story media selectively covering make Trump look bad. made huge bet January February virus really analogous flu, CNN would embarrass covering civilization-ruining pandemic turned ""only"" 30-40,000 elderly people died.

Had case, Fox would vindicated, Trump/G.O.P. would big elections, mainstream media would severely discredited. Unfortunately, Fox lost bet.

It turns virus like political scandal, sense objective reality humans get sick die virus, fact immune spin, deflection bullying. unfortunately, entire conservative ecosystem stuck original narrative January unable change it. phase 2 results, Oxford already started phase 3 trial Brazil last really aren’t dicking about. good example happens practice appropriate precautions mitigate risks masks sanitization. think both, since either/or proposition. People less likely get sick vaccine. better outcomes treatment. get control. Stop complicating superior knowledge history politics. mean, sorry, Gretzky number one, go LeBatts! Permission board ehhhay? sounds like third world citizenry governed first world millionaires. 

That country ... prison steps complications. Awe THANKS MCuh Youre Benelvolence ASAvior. 100 million doses US end year plan. 30 million UK believe. challenge convincing people vaccine 5G mind control serum developed Bill Gates. never knew OC Housewives Utah! *Banjo music intensifies* would honestly require *more* foresight cunning administration simply preparing adequately virus preventing destroying public health economy. Quite literally “proaction” would simpler less expensive “reaction.” Germany and? Well case, hope. note, date single confirmed re-infection. Exactly, Sweden clearly failed prioritizing lockdowns contact tracing.

I glad public conscious, despite domestic high per capita denialism foreigners blindly love laissez faire inaction, realize Sweden test case *not* control epidemic. 

The failure impose tough bright line rules, absence contact tracing control freedom wisdom. stupidity high per capita deaths.


Another point: even Sweden pure test case. They've banned gatherings 50. small start probably pretty important too. Oh, definitely agree. always wear mask going out.

 pointing reason many people disobey Fauci's lies start pandemic + Trump's anti-science stance + American exceptionalism causing people prioritize ""freedom"" anything else. wait two weeks getting results know teammates opponents virus free?

oh wait, separate health care system rich important Depends situation.

For me, I've got leverage world. work I'm litterarly person knows several mission critical systems work (something I've warned times). boss retiring 2-3 years boss care work home things normal.

So end day, I'll working home .

The wife though, whole company way board pushing get people back office. boss early 40s plans retire current role going anywhere. Plus works banking processing loans department sales 90% volume. leverage. think truckers usually independent contractors, they'd create new contracts competitors share profits. words, final call. I’ve started seeing friends maybe twice week. Nothing big; either appropriate hang outside houses go high school football field exercise. Every field get occupied bunch different people running track, using side field running bleachers. normal still feel little uncomfortable within presence others? basically staying home since March recently going makes super paranoid every time go out. must old... What's mms? Surface transmission also much lower one would think transmission via food almost nil. 


[The chance infected someone household percentage highly affected close infected person - again, sharing pillow, kissing, etc. 


[Here decent guidance surfaces emphasizing main way spreads. virus live long outside human considered vector main way transmission droplets close contact infected person. mom would close physical contact dad, logical person get infected household.  We've playing long con here: let virus ravage TF us, get early access first vaccine. Mild effects headache and/or fever said, treated paracetamol. 

I'm curious side effects could dangerous amongst vulnerable. sure safe trial participants young healthy? New York massive protests spike. Well, wanted wall...  paid $1400 (out pocket ins) blood test scheduled appointment, fuck USA healthcare system. Anyone wondering drug medical remedy might see COVID every right talk context busted system.

I care personally like see it. Britain, already are. I'll open tab ;) like statement mean, experts definitely underestimated pandemic potential virus, even article title says pandemic spread ""unlikely"", impossible. one thinks pandemics exclusive domain influenza; influenza pandemics simply common kind recent human experience. guess one people coughs sneezes without covering face, too. all, inside elbow shit, better spray fluids everybody. Lol yes. supporting theory.

You feel mask gives freedom move safely.

I believe reason CDC, etc changed position external pressure. government realized many people scared shitless COV would leave homes. Masks help feeble feel confident enough leave homes help contribute economy. similar symptoms covid ready use...

""There dangerous side-effects taking vaccine, however, 70% people trial developed either fever headache.

The researchers say could managed paracetamol.

Prof Sarah Gilbert, University Oxford, UK, says: ""There still much work done confirm vaccine help manage Covid-19 pandemic, early results hold promise."" almost shrinking government drowned bathtub bad idea, Grover Norquist, paying stupidity wide-spread death misery, fine institutions ancestors set protect us stripped usefulness self-serving creeps. help much n95? No. help? Yes. God wish chinstrap would go away. Marylander here. Let tell you, cases going up. colleagues see second lock inevitable. Scince b*tch can't believe common practice already. makes complete sense. government said masks low effect prevention spreading virus

Nothing proven conclusively, statement false. Wearing masks prevents transmission.

However, may reasons government making masks mandatory. Prevalence high enough justify it, mask shortage plain incompetence (you know looking at).

So, wearing mask high-risk situations like public transportation probably fine now. situation worsens even slight respiratory symptoms wear mask. Even mandatory. Obviously. I'm sure mean tbh. Berlin consistent numbers new Corona cases since beginning May (with slight decline since then). Since beginning June 50 people intensive care corona one time. Even large % cases reported, consistent number. virus accelerating spread. system ""traffic lights"" place numbers grow quickly certain sectors economy society automatically shut without argument. IMO really can't compare situation even CT USA CT 19.5x many deaths.  new york resident here, place morgue got busted many corpses mean, details important honestly somewhat unclear surrounding COVID especially since large movement people believe exists. I'm saying thing people getting divorced might straw broke camels back many cases sad hear. 

Basically buy idea could set reasonable expectations pandemic toward beginning relationship. something many many couples going work through. understand: Phase III trial started UK parallel phase II, replicated Brazil South Africa weeks later start. UK trial started first almost certainly going close unfinished enough virus circulating community prove vaccinated getting COVID. original first data cut UK PIII trial [3 months](http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN89951424), believe protocol Brazil looking September close.

Edit: data cut.  They'll fire trying book Black Friday off. guess say we're prisoners stupid people. live Miami? literally said stop watching tv thousands miles away, link national news article. 

People following mandates. Businesses don’t allow people without masks. fantastic news!

[Here's paper Oxford vaccine trial (ChAdOx1 [here's paper competing vaccine (Ad5) trigger strong antibody T-cell responses, high rate mild side effects. Oxford study included prophylactic treatment paracetamol ameliorate side effects. Antibodies peaked 28 days declined day 56. 10 participants given booster shot, effective raising antibody count decline - change T-cell count.

Both currently undergoing Phase 2 trials larger sample sets around world. Oxford vaccine set proceed Phase 3 trials, expected Wuhan one (but confirmed yet).

So they're tolerably safe provide strong immune response. Still needs confirmation effectiveness Phase 3/challenge trials see degree immunity conferred long lasts, extremely good news.  Well racial issue burning topic moment, I'm one people believes we're cut cloth get heads try working together achieve greatness rather trying get one someone else, matter colour/religion/gender/sexual preference. 

But thing is, we're tribal people core, evolved past yet. people care close family, would even shaft close friend meant getting rich/laid/personal gain. 

It's shame, really believe mankind works together, we'd conquer cancer, we'd colonise Mars we'd beat climate change. Instead I'm sitting 40 degree heat, mum cancer, Mars pipe dream :D 10,000 people take part next stage trials UK.

They even done large-scale trials yet. 13 days finally got positive Covid test results. health department informed mandatory 10 day quarantine... ended 3 days ago... Thanks heads up, guess? idea accurate is, read US seniors front line medical workers get first, followed underlying heath conditions. Roughly 100M doses expected end year 100% US population vaccine May 2021. looks ""purposeful negative"" top comment getting lots upvotes, even unfettered optimism, straight based counterfactual headline.

But really? Stating facts. Thats it. Nothing more, nothing less.

And next response him. Holy fuck soldier believing people working help us.

Yes, two ways be: getting vaccine September ""There arent even people working vaccines.""

I guess end this, want start calling pessimist said likely Oct/Nov? Thats potrntially pessimistic stance guy called September plop into. agree. pointing narrow thinking false statements harm good. Factual accurate information best way fight this. happen someone disagree also definitely idiot. Miami's mayor got fairly early maybe stringent county state covid response. Sadly holds little weight notoriously-aloof state governor, mixed fact economy based commuting travel practically negates one county's stricter pandemic response neighbor counties responses basically ""meh, wear mask feel like guess"". Read paper. generates neutralizing antibodies 50-60% subjects. Edit** sorry that’s cansinos paper, up. 91% first dose 100% boost positive sure astra.

Problem AstraZeneca vaccine strong reaction even administered paracetamol see could reduce effects. healthiest population risk people want take this.

Media manipulating reports Pfizer AstraZeneca pump markets. Moderna posted wonderful results far small study mind you. There's lot amount viral load lethality since early on. even opinion piece comparing amount poison New York times. According article tiny viral among young soldiers induce antibodies without disease.  Yeah, like run actual analysis it. interesting theory require gain-of-function research. could lab accident samples collected miners, delayed six years lab Wuhan construction five years.   Hot weather impact virus. Air Con inside significantly negates that.

I know parodying deniers say, implies there's truth behind it. Maybe lump rest Europe one country decided fuck lockdown. Masks mandatory stores Germany countries.

Not mention European countries including Sweden way smaller number cases.

I'm keeping average sane American clear blame say US better Europe seems ridiculous. Even coming someone brainwashed following cult leader US. 

They official cases rivaled Brazil. Ok then. look places online stay home safe. Thank you.

You can't put cart horse. Allow first develop thicker skin. wait antivaxxers claim government conspiracy. think he’s mandating masks personal gain? Googling coronavirus never useful again. grammar critical thinking skills appalling someone supposedly higher education. Apparently let idiot university days, long pay up. paywall.  Maybe gotten job STEM related field. rednecks work. Try harder, sweetie :)  McAllen's one poorest cities United States. Stuff like happen types areas.

ok Look Nightingale hospital UK, set case hospitals ran beds. 100x better equipped thst place even end using it.

That changed virus.

The last time spoke her, begging come visit lonely. knew come back Florida week told visiting weeks.

She lost shit. Laughed face derisively (figuratively, phone) asked became 1iberal p*ssy. Telling whole thing hoax sheep believing it, everyone probably already know it. Etc, etc, know lines.

I've gotten arguments pulled whole ""It's real happens me"" shit before, one friends got deported devastated. admitted maybe *his* immigration policies wrong... suffered it.

Now virus.

I'm done. Lemme guess, politics weren’t responsible 10x plus deaths NY? 

Yes let’s discuss without fuckin politics protect patients, it’s hospital keep elective procedures. 

Also- covid patients deserve treatment ffs, crammed un-air conditioned buildings lack even oxygen. sad. Sending prayers comfort strength parents.  weeks ago got desperate applying factory jobs. Apparently I'm qualified wouldnt even interview me. Fuck people go around doxing. It’s nuts, I’ve seen credible looking reports show mask usage lower country. Realistically, hospital workers high risk people might see September October. regular person probably early next year. right now-see pfizer/biontech...id know, work  New Mexico? free people....much freedom ""i right eventually"" -trump interview fox news weekend. I’m saying all. said pretty clear, basic English. Yes, covid patients deserve place help live. cesspit die in. anti maskers “Karen’s” would actually listen curve thing like countries would fine nooo throw fit wearing mask. shit sad Domestic violence sexual violence increased.

I'm sure white collar crime increased one cares that.

Most blue collar crime down, though. I’m sure that’s so, didn’t spend lot time area around airport hotel, definitely didn’t see entire town. didn’t see anyone appeared middle class there, remember struck odd. 

Then hell hot there, even local standards, maybe it’s people money make. live McAllen I'm gonna right day.... fair, that's America armpit asshole world. wax bleach want, change is. tl;dw accurate covid tests, RT-PCR, accurate required detect covid (as real virus ,vs fragments, transmissible viral loads) time required turn around makes useless tracking.

Paragraphs friend Hurricane Katrina. The... Virus... Spreads...

Remember vote y'all. Deranged Donnie continues treat presidency though hosting **reality TV show** desperately seeking high viewership ratings feed insatiable ego.

And get listen deranged moron declare daily basis -- *thanks perfect response pandemic* \-- America envy world . Can't wait. Time put rapid dog  never notice subtlety racist stores name is? Oh well Dixie gonna loose bet. Think Vegas without teeth. pretty safe estimate 3 weeks, vast majority recovered? Plus deaths, true unknown still 3 weeks (or make 4 5 weeks, pick number) No, already infected soldier available treatments far use developed antibodies immunity. There’d little point causing body stress it’s already going trying survive virus. Desantis going get absolutely blown fuck 2022 election, lmao Children deserve education. 

Period. also good time work things, share feelings possibly online marriage counseling read marriage books...  fallacy compare counties Unite States. European Union mask mandate?

Rather, compare countries individual American states. literally sums entire problem know someone visited Jenner months lockdown, non covid laboratory work stopped. team working vaccine meals provided administrators quickly realised time normal things like shop cook, every waking hour every day month's. hope everyone involved gets recognition deserve. shit, wonder might long term feel like probably worth regardless  sold big pharma $1000 dose good hospitals terrifying is.. unprecedented access, award-winning filmmaker Sasha Joelle Achilli goes inside hospital coronavirus crisis northern Italy, capturing unforgettable look harrowing, heroic fight doctors nurses waging disease.

Netflix Doc called Lenox Hill. NYC hospital. covid episode

from March.. ***before*** onslaught knew coming. Im sorry 30% still thinks orangeman hero US. Bolsonaro large following Brazil. Mexico still wants AMLO President. Boris Johnson still significant approval ratings covid. Eastern Europe turned Russian “regions” again. Africa still unknown. people South America think virus overhyped since Russia offered miracle “cure”, mostly opened everything back without protocol. caused misinformation. people count herd immunity? rare potentially serious damage virus others? Damn, vaccine gonna everyone respecing guys think US eventually shutdown let 300-500k people die end year? simple search led believe you’re already providing false statement re: it’s manipulated media? I’m looking actual numbers. cannot misinterpret Peer reviewed scientific data, fellow countrymen finding way. Generally speaking, US citizens taught critical thinking skills manipulated whatever think best want believe cognitive bias. 

That’s insane, bat-shit crazy, truth denying population planet right now. 

To clear, don’t mean Americans, large enough portion guys completely fucked. 

Also lol think choosing red blue make huge difference grand scheme things. “democracy” farce entire world knows No, fall 2020 next year. 1/4 U.S. taking seriously. 1/2 isn't, we're way beyond manageable. 

So....just go back normal wait vaccine? Lol, no. Oh, I’m aware. I’ve done lots food delivery / catering state folks families local hospitals. family travels state care, it’s better. Hell, medical care moved back home Cali. 

But also wonder affects stats. don’t know would able answer that.

I would imagine state folks show “hospitalizations” that’s reported hospitals. “new cases” that’s reported county residence. know US also developed vaccine basically stage Oxford vaccine right...? Downvoted posting literal facts..? Stay classy Reddit That's totally said genius! /s quite valid point.  hard justify simple savings account interest rate essentially negative. 

My parents grew Great Depression.  raised pinch pennies always couple dollars hidden shoe.  qualities seem laughed at. Read comments post. Sorry, clear. understanding, US FDA would permit challenge trial happen stateside. entirely possible cleared whichever applicable governing body challenge trial UK.

And honestly, ok healthy volunteers fully educated risks willingly offering participate challenge trial. scientifically speaking gold standard demosntrating efficacy. let people volunteer go risk lives combat scenarios, see ethical difference challenge trial. issue UK? die Covid, die alone, scared, pain. got 1% population (3.8m cases 328m people). Imagine really gets bad. Well, true. parts US would issue parts US wouldn't. Right areas 2,5 million people running daily number 6 positive tests/100,000. Easily range cases. could batched tested.

It could also used professional sports already high level testing needs done daily. Well sadly, enforcing mask usage might reduce customer base even more. likely still nothing financial calculation. horrid one morally, but, that's likely think starting sell good ones get triple thick home sewn ones given free place. lucked n95 stuff already parents. sibling... well, see point high quality masks. that's great. It’s way hot outside, least south. meant “government bit shit” statement They’re market sell groceries. save lives. zombie plague starts.


But seriously hope vaccine super effective! really. Martial arts meant group supervision teacher, otherwise pick bad habits. It'd like soccer football yourself. Sure there's stuff do, going get better unless actually play game people. *this* zombie apocalypse happens? OP, tried refusing, told would fired come in. Even though 100% job home last months. horrible. I’m engineer know stop talking authority comes field absolutely knowledge trust experts. move countries still student loans? Asking friend. Legal not. Doesn’t matter. Country similar population? Again, spin numbers way want, compare apples apples. idea much US changed elections political process? Rioting protests help influence process, hardly drive it.

I write less influence you, illuminate issue casual browsers. seem pretty angry right now, internet conversations lack nuance. doubt really connect text. Maybe beer perhaps.

Voting voice. voice voice. choose ignore possibility incremental improvement dont feel listened playing want do. Voter suppression tactic, self suppressing. Local voting critical, presidental voting less so. 

You reasons angry, I. hurting youself ignoring tool. Use drive change, matter small. Rioting destruction used exclusively drives change unpredictable ways, end worse started with. one's actually true. Even base level electoral college system designed make vote alone. Stack top shady stuff election process (before final vote) really get much choice. Isn’t “I legend” started why? rivals point coming UK one allies alienated america. Well probably take early next year general availability given. Probably high risk groups healthcare people get first affected areas general public. problem vaccines needed worldwide scale number billions, 

producing take time even factories prepared case. live central europe think get hand vaccine sometime 2021. good bad, bad could earlier, rather would worse affected areas us get first (Brazil, US states etc...), good wont first time get clear picture long term sideffects. good thing, incomes slashed people working. extra $2400 month unemployment benefits nice idea good one unintended consequence increasing household incomes. Meaning motivates people stay unemployed, good functioning economy. want people working, part stimulus job creation. Ideally would hire people minimum wage rebuild crumbling infrastructure. fall back digging holes order fill that's still better people working. 

We also need living wage, great time bring push increases federal, state, local minimum wages. do! arm sore like 2 weeks last tetanus shot. PTSD enabled Saying masks need back March really going leave stain Dr. Fauci's record. developed extremely low threshold fuckery 🤣 mean, that's works though. look Florida, what... 49% Democratic? Texas closing 50/50. Even Deep South millions millions millions people trying right away, relying science medicine many people one getting burned. ACTUALLY relied evolution weed people (and assuming static exterior forces), still waiting thousands millions years. feels good say ""weed out"" like feels good say ""the wicked get punishment hell good rewarded heaven"" that's platitudes distract sucky reality.  Blugh, got depressed writing this... wet dreams universal human rights world would better place :( believe says. answer is, care lacks compassion empathy.  says end year I'm inclined say yes (probably). 

And would really amazing. try think spring next year realistic still bureaucratic hurdles disappointed. 

However, timeline end year. :-) mean, right available 2024, looking available spring 2021 general public early September year high risk people Anyone find interesting China much larger population fallen map COVID-19 related cases? They've stayed 85000 months now. India seems keeping track things better China. Presican’t Chump

This boomer level shit hope never need convalescent plasma,”** said OneBlood George “Bud” press conference, Florida GOP Executive Director Helen Aguirre Ferré spoke recent left good making noise saving lives,” Ferré tweeted**. “Gov. Ron DeSantis’s message recovered COVID19 save life donating plasma suffering virus. agitators don’t want know lives transitioning Florida GOP role serving DeSantis’s communications director since start term January 2019.

So. summary: 
 “*They* aren’t good saving lives, unlike *us*, threatening withhold life saving treatment *they* interrupted us rude.” Great decision.

I know bar owners hurt closures, beyond that, heck, liquor stores open that's WAY cheaper way drink anyway.  get hospital bill. actually track recoveries like NC. 
They literally estimate them. fucking INTERNET. Stop policing language internet excuse pick fights. pathetic be? people take virus seriously manageable.

 many vaccines around corner. ( late 2020, almost late 2020. )

 America brink idiocracy. virus shows little americans educated. smartest one room, Sure!  coronavirus making comeback bigger Robert Downey, Jr, believe that, least, team sports cancelled coming fall probably spring, too. 

Really, pandemic control here, could take couple years based idiocracy hand. Look again, minority voted current president. opponent actually votes. election system broken. even need majority win. Gerrymandering, ""electoral collage"", voter suppression. We're flawed democracy. late.

That would effective hit infection rates seeing now, infection rates hit certain level, nearly every test batch going least one positive result - meaning followup testing everyone required.

They dragged feet long option useful. wondered Alpharetta doing! Thanks sharing. We'll see everyone another month... Oxford vaccine train immune system

So, normal vaccine? agree that. originally responding statements flat-out saying safe. soon us conclude that. probably is, know. supposed sound positive!? Apparently NIH director hasnt Twitter reddit last 15 years everything politicized polarized death. Literal death. lot dumb people 😔 Random question, someone takes working vaccine, prohibit ability tell covid (i.e. unknowingly covid asymptomatic)? antiamerican sentiment Ecuador Beastars Animal Crossing already started earlier March. Make sure go comment thread read informative comment - appears chimp adenoviruses _in general_ cause significant immune reaction used vector, great news vaccines including future. took 9 days get results even Alabama called long term planning. jab everyone hope covers forever. 

You vaccinate enough cover years case people need top up. quick math based notion herd immunity (in vacuum) say 70% achieve magical result: 

Pop India: 1.3b people
Pop needed get herd immunity: 910million

Your gonna Gonna break eggs ~~kill people~~ get there.

good luck that!

Also, Truman Show style universities plastic dome? Taxes proportionate income, healthcare isn't. wealthy, healthcare bill keep going (but tax bill would). think large part ruling classes think good idea.

(And opposite also true; working &amp; middle classes, proportionate taxes pay off.) Exactly. vaccines certain failure rate, in, won’t give 100% protection get it

I know. enough people don’t get it, virus still gets run wild.

Mainly among them. Filthy American here. end Austria? glass block UV light main disinfect sunlight? completely true, seems people think depend types things happen mortality rate constant every single hospital. good comparison without defining hard throw guns food scalding hot sharp.. Trump want close borders....guess got wanted. see perspective. Still would try find solutions time.


Something like: people already whole act several times get exemption it, already proved follow rules.


In end can’t really force propitious travel, planes grounded and/or overbooked is.

Check out, hilarious. Chinese even read article.

It's  gOOd dEaL!! america... Looking replies, seems though merely recipient incoherent rage woman dared leader. guy fraud. believe average American idea significance positivity rate governments need spin that. actually think might confusing... someone may go ""positivity rate?? wow media making stuff bored (or agenda)"" girlfriend supposed go fucking wedding FL August. I’m buying ticket hope god gets cancelled postponed. one test two tests? One negative test give certainty. Can't air drop like Agent Orange? absolutely crazy think it’s “feel-good” law. Yes, exchange ridiculous prices, part public option declined GOP center democrats. 
 
Also, ignore pre-existing condition protection, pocket maximum protection, coverage cap blocking, free preventative care, yeah nothing. Oh, wait, forgot also attempted regulate profits saying 85% premium profit go medical costs. Meanwhile reddit criticism instantaneous... things work good day age always socialist I'm down. I'm really starting feel like whole US thing run course scrap start something new. far gone and.  wearing masks? Probably not. lot re-opening problems would reduced mask. problem means nothing people won’t it. aren’t. construction definitely shut opinion. live it’s hot hell right know construction workers myself. Can’t speak everyone obviously apparently it’s hot wearing something faces work day make safety glasses fog creating different hazard. I’m sure could corrected reduced right type mask. I’m repeating told. Yes, course, Americans scared showed up. fact, showed yesterday post thread, single problem anywhere world.

Take care. So, according story, top management two moderately important companies (like, plenty economic power, Gazprom) got chance obtain vaccine, yet country's Prime Minister President's spokesman not, since got infected (the latter hospitalized) months supposed vaccination began take place? makes sense. It’s “fishy,” says right article going recent days, Florida Department Health noticed smaller, private labs weren’t reporting negative test result data state. Department immediately began working labs ensure results reported order provide comprehensive transparent data.""

Labs reporting positives negatives. percentage wrong, total positive cases reported accurate. one reporting false positive friend relative lives Florida.

Funny how, people posting stories social media, news outlet able track speak anyone happened to... Yes, U.S. government, also U.S. mainstream media.

Check article, filled bizarre 

It's surprise assert superiority belittling countries regimes

The Chinese care know thing develop. 

Also language, surprising Westerners comfortable cultures non-English speaking circles

But met father reddit whose daughter learning Chinese.

It's hard really understand China without getting introduction Chinese, U.S. government mainstream media seized gap.

But end, they'll get deserve. anyone else bit hesitant inject vaccine China? made trustworthy country (UK, Canada, France, Germany, US etc.) would willing get it. Even would want studied first safe. ""By design, mask could really contaminated, recommend people think masks biohazard,"" Reynolds said. random tv station talked one person made statement SEVEN DAYS. Yes found Covid staterooms cruise ships 17 days... rna detected doesn’t mean it’s viable... RemindMe! 4 weeks Yeah sister rich boyfriend flew Miami last weekend Arkansas vacation. Unbelievable. Thanks. reasonable question. hit hard lot people died. don’t think cases dealing due superior containment. fools listened followed NY's lead. trying kill voters (too obvious, happen fast enough matter), actually lot simpler that. politicizing it, they've divided electorate two groups: Republicans tend downplay severity issue take seriously risks Coronavirus, Democrats tend opposite. consider November virus still likely major issue (potentially even worse now), combine Republican efforts restrict mail voting (forcing people vote person) attempting minimize polling locations (increasing chance people need congregate larger groups vote), end result Democrats less likely vote person due fear virus Republicans. really simple...this yet another attempt Republicans minimize voter turnout order boost chances victory polls. checked alibaba, see listed yet interferon alpha beta signal receptor, similar would likely induce comparable responses administered identically. Interferons long known induce extremely potent antiviral responses. efficacious, dosing route timing likely key. What's point positivity rating anyway, then? seems misleading informative. Put mask dashboard car expose sunlight. light doesn’t kill heat will.  that's linear progression numbers! gotta think expodentially! think call something goal unless measures achieve it.  happens anti science/populist crowd power  Source? sad statement marked sarcastic. people unironically arguing that. would like do.

Anyone makes suggestion ends costing life charged murder. norm, let's see fast people continue talk without thinking. understanding Houston overrun hospitals weeks. making people scared? seems counterproductive.

Also, create thread moaning someone else's democratically elected leader?

This discussion makes likely visit America Canada. Greece while. Pay more. 50% minimum wage still enough live matter great so-called “bonuses benefits” are.  Wait til hurricane season. never denied saying regarding systemic diseases.

Fuck (And washes hands us) 😣 Lockdown nothing else bought time get ready come. hit like March nothing wouldve set testing would still infancy. we're untouchable caste that’s literally what’s happening. Stonk line must go cost idiotic let run rampant especially states like Florida rely tourism. one going want visit Rona Ron never shut down. local mayors protect us. Late stage capitalism hell drug.

Go get antibody test. They're free, take less 10 minutes, results day two.

labcorp.com producers confirmed 300m doses available US September/October.

umm, link this?

if hope ready september, british made vaccine 300 million doses ready america - within weeks completion?

And 300 million doses nearly enough. Everyone would need least 2 doses, obviously account distribution/storage/transportation/quality-control related inventory losses friend lives Orlando last week guy told go back country. like ""France?"". They're racist tan white people. Covid: I'm suuuuuuurging vaccine maybe given billion people, may show long term effects sooner normal. Go China. Hospitals quicker turnaround time surgeries also. testing only. take test test two days before. Construction large industry, calling essential (which US) reckless. construction worker first “canary coal mine” going needlessly drawn out. 

It’s like went road crews home remodels. even “essential” jobs like hospitals. 
Hell liked idea transit road work hard covid, outside work would better. 

But didn’t. aren’t. 
We stayed jobs. Working restaurants, office spaces, millionaires condo buildings. 

Construction definitely grounds major covid break out. 
You think general contractors(GC) care sanitizing frequently touched surfaces?
How temporary air handlers? Aerosols main issue, haven’t seen heard GC setting temporary air exchange. 
All day every day stagnant air sits around. 
Yes construction workers outside. working place doesn’t windows outside walls closed in. 
Those instances limited experience. 

We frequently working closed areas others. 

And it’s difficult wear masks physical work, especially since many us also wear hard hats, safety glasses constantly. 
Even us take seriously pull masks occasionally get deep breath allow glasses unfog. research this: protesting spread, cancelled large number people stayed home protests, presumably avoid them. net neutral. based cellphone movement data, see full paper activity lower risk: ""The odds primary case transmitted COVID-19 closed environment 18.7 times greater compared open-air environment (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.0, 57.9).

For comparison, took less 24 hours get results test Germany last week. “There terrorists everywhere”

If they’re here, they’re challenge name improvements happened 50 years. pretty rude them, considering vote alone decides presidency. single death tragedy; million deaths statistic. lol link please  Literally: cremated 😣 lazy: current trends interventions continue, Florida hospitals unlikely become overloaded next 30 6,137 ICU beds. Based best available data, estimate 63% (3,877) currently occupied non-COVID patients. 2,260 ICU beds remaining, estimate 3,322 needed COVID cases, available beds.

which sketchy IDK tell OP article says 18% state's adult ICU beds available 

and main thing remember dynamic situation. 

Central Florida’s largest hospitals ICU beds [but say scale COVID-19 demand Americans seriously think relocate whenever feel like inconvenience countries? There's lot going pictures. 

One stand things oxygen, rate used at. bringing cause concern supply, management, potential desperate use oxygen candles ends badly. sounds awful, sorry hear this! lung capacity tested? Nope must protect leaders first. idiot canadians rise, move south us worship trump said would self quarantine want sign papers. opened 2 weeks ago America purchased 300m, bought 100m turns sequel movie Legend. love butter spaghetti shredded cheese! tip. wait pandemic control US considering move. border closed FYI. Fuck asshole. stroke drama fix responding. Downvote move rational discussion. Yes. know that. study expose people coronavirus. ability vaccine protect coronavirus still theoretical. Make sure vote next election. government let down. point excuse prepared dealing problems arise. picked corporate welfare people again.

Sorry everything going through. disgusting even read observe eyes. times 10000x actual healthcare worker. 

The response covid America feels like we're third world country. true leadership anywhere Well.... vaccine keeps people take safe, choose take deal consequences. would like reverse mask situation lol ""Impractical-to-avoid end result"" exactly flattering either, since almost certainly Sure. Swedish experts (as well fellows Scandinavian countries) made judgement suppression impossible. current data points probably wrong.

It's seemed obvious since April me, likely already since March looking South Korea. Putting two two together China could tell likely work:

1. Bring number infected level contact tracing keep up, expanding testing capacity parallel

2. Ease restrictions keep infections contact tracing local measures needed

Folkehelseinstittutet Norway [also seems paying Folkhälsomyndigheten kept [completely misjudging well mid-May, obviously known better, *still* seems stuck ways.

No one perfect information beginning, Folkhälsomyndigheten messed (1) putting harder brakes obviously idea dealing with, (2) sticking obviously incorrect assumptions way long.

And I'm tired *all foreign experts politically steamrolled* narrative, I'll [preemptively include Sure, principle arguing difference herd immunity goal inevitability semantics. practice experience people draw conclusions actions countries, based that.

Haven't seen that. people think we're arrogant stupid, agree. handling never came across anything gross incompetence me.

I've pulling hair months going ""Look South Korea! Look Hong Kong! They're obviously suppressing virus, without hard restrictions! fuck doing?""

Meanwhile bunch condescending people paying attention going ""bUt haPPen LiFt rEStriCtiOnS hURr DURrr?"", spent time coming increasingly far-fetched rationalizations. Ive using mail ballots AZ since could vote. Im 34

My whole family republican parents grandparents, republican using mail voting entire life.

I switched democrat 20s still use it. 

Using voter fraud easy sending something claiming someone else. decided time die it. 

Yet many accept “peacefully” seek relief drowning fluids healthcare workers instead prayers God? honestly feel like people think “oh well, die sometime” “if it’s God’s will” never close terrible actual process dying be. American, say reason want socialized medicine mostly-privatized health care. Treatment exorbitantly overpriced government bribes/lobbying made so. Like everything else government-run around here, guaranteed done, would way siphons much taxpayer money possible executives' pockets. can't trust government keep executive greed check, executives run government. executives already power screw us get sick. want power taxes screw us we're well, too!

The salaries/wages essential people (teachers, nurses, etc.) embarrassment country, especially light money poured them. money exists, goes entirely wrong people. brother wife hiring one niece. think lot smart parents getting can. cost skyrocket couple months folly opening realized everyone dropping like flies. What's going happen vaccine safe ready distributed masses? pull shit that? Like could seriously envision spouting conspiracy theories virus global stage.  mean truly hope he's come 2021 nothing would surprise days. Deflation horizon. plan obviously masks.

But we're screwed, four months anti-mask inertia overcome.

So yeah. Go America. really using throwaway account past 3 years? Southern New Mexico. terms people staying home varies lot area area. places closer Texas Arizona 'my freedoms', northern area, southern area, Navaho nation (which severly impacted), staying home part.

Proof pudding So. anti gens high probability right says ""True"" axiomatically assumed they're indeed positive. said true- negative anti gen test confirmed PCR test( safe). current policy. pretty easy spot people privilege really understand rioting.

And really interesting define violence terms broken windows COVID deaths. NY, NJ, CT formed joint coalition beginning handle things way unified. Wouldn’t surprise me. probably huge turnover elected officials, based decisions made made response pandemic. might sound naive got vaccine phase many caught virus?Why dont reveal this? PHOENIX (AP) — Arizona reporting all-time highs use ventilators beds intensive care units coronavirus state Department Health Services posted 671 COVID-19 patients ventilators 936 occupying ICUs Sunday. Hospitals hovering around 90% officials report another 1,357 confirmed COVID-19 cases eight additional deaths. Arizona seen 123,824 cases 2,245 deaths. However, number infections thought far higher many people tested, studies suggest people infected virus without feeling *is* Zombie apocalypse? education given isolated unwashed. taking it, that's good. Get pussies go back living life, please. Pooling work unless infection rate low. actually waste time money US. would like apply Brazil part. anyone know find link? Texas too, governor ate words live TV, sign executive order *requiring masks* worn public county 20 active covid-19 cases. 3 months late. county ability mandate masks saw fit beginning.  totally agree that’s wider discussion whole mess leave campaign propaganda wagon, totally understand frustration must experiencing hope somehow come mess still strong position. hope strong stronger probably long gone hopefully aren’t damaged bad   people never able live down. careers politics going over. I'm pretty sure one assholes helped spread Covid exactly going get piece human garbage re-elected.   I'm 21 incredibly jaded country. Soon can, I'm leaving. don’t know everyone suddenly acting like Moderna vaccine isn’t thing now... likely world go eradication 2021 like polio  wonder realizes gamble he's playing, there's pretty good chance going governor Georgia years won't. Yeah good point. expert, article provides information support theory can't get COVID-19 once. Everything article suggests GET AGAIN. seems like ""magical thinking"" doctor outset article says ""no cause alarm.""  make sense may start seeing cases re-infection novel coronavirus, common coronavirus infections,"" said Dr. Todd Ellerin&lt;&lt;

So, immune coronaviruses permanently. would one? 

There significant cause alarm COVID-19 vaccine provide temporary immunity. potentially means COVID-19 us forever, nudging human mortality rates around world, well side-effects still learning about.

Lots people sub know -- wrong? Good point. hope least makes farther reddit page people actually go investigate it. Hospitals forcing nondisclosures make hard everyone see whats really going on. hopefully you’re upset Canada Europe using compulsory licensing pharmaceuticals, think know answer that.  PCR tests reliable anti gens? Fun fact: common hospitals run ICU wards near-full occupancy. surprise nobody ICUs get full pandemic seems escaped everyone's memory USA demonstrated capacity stand field hospital quickly necessary. writers really wrote entire 2020 setup Chad punchline.  face shield prevent exhaling microdroplets quickly evaporate leave behind aerosolized virus. bueno itself. September? chance. Possibly end year. understand that. I've personal struggles catastrophic injuries insurance. 

My issue stupid ""US bad"" comment. criticizing faults US means think us evil something. That's great, hopefully lasts, government people irresponsible, could prevented happened hospitals wonder states northeast same. seem lot things. that. opposed look typical hospital bills (mostly) paid insurance, like $10,000 broken arm whatever, think *that's* amount single-payer system would using taxes. inconceivable would *cost less* different system, plus US currently already spends healthcare per capita world *despite* socialized (almost $10,000 per person, versus $4750 Canada).  wish true. would say level truth numbers reported certain areas people positive get retested counted new case every time retest. told family member working test pod. 

Its still serious issue oblivious scope everything. got virus control first place like every country developed world choices made... United Stupid America FTW! can't believe this. can't believe happening

Every single day wake worse news medical, economic, law enforcement (or whatever fuck going secret police Trump sending out), untreated physical health issue, family getting slowly dying covid...

...and think none nightmare real. I'm living nightmare worse could ever imagined. 

And I'm nurse, doctor front lines. can't imagine stress under, anxiety fear suffer tremendous, yet nothing compared going through.

I'm sorry, sorry us all.

This horrifying. Ok, read that: stakes cure AIDS, H1N1, autism, etc. know, probably cure things, count death cure. fuck safe quotes? simple. continue problem still hoax, reconciliation, would admit defeat. disgusting. Anti maskers go Places requires masks make stink.  native French actually vis-à-vis :) totally get some. called masks, quarantine, fucking idiot claiming sort God given right freedom selfishly putting others risk. late that...

No, we're still first wave.  much spread still happening everything shut rest country.

Also, NYC many people blowing precautions they've gotten phase 4. Even upstate people traveling Florida Vaca still! Florida literally worse right upstate NYC peak.

It’s disgusting.  “We” realized would really fucking bad January videos started popping people China falling dead street, China went complete lockdown shut internal travel, Chinese cities started welding people apartments, Wuhan started emergency construction multiple hospitals, medical workers whole country brought help out, etc., virologists epidemiologists started saying “prepare everyone, big one.” (The early Chinese numbers obviously dramatic undercount – partly expected sudden epidemic new disease, partly result ass covering corrupt local officials – Chinese actions spoke themselves. Nobody around world needed 100% perfect numbers spring action.)

Then “we” validated concern February number cases started exploding Italy Iran, followed weeks later wave deaths.

“We” saw fast could spread literally infected entire cult church South Korea several thousand people course weeks, “we” also saw effective government action could contain spread watched South Korean government spring action unprecedented amazing testing contact tracing effort.

Unfortunately public officials NY state NYC 2–3 weeks slow, result whole lot people died would acted decisively (much blame goes federal government, completely screwed testing). Thankfully recognized mistake got together less reasonable response since time.

COVID-19-associated morbidity mortality attributed pathologic host response. Two divergent hypotheses proposed: hyper-inflammatory ‘cytokine-storm’-mediated injury versus failure host protective immunity resulting unrestrained viral dissemination organ injury. key explanation inability address controversy lack diagnostic tools evaluate immune function COVID-19 infections. ELISpot, highly sensitive, functional immunoassay employed 27 COVID-19, 51 septic, 18 critically-ill non-septic (CINS), 27 healthy controls evaluate adaptive innate immune status quantitating cell IFN-ɣ monocyte TFN-α production. Circulating cell subsets profoundly reduced COVID-19 patients. Additionally, stimulated blood mononuclear cells produced less 40% 50% IFN-ɣ TNF-α observed septic CINS patients, consistent markedly impaired immune effector cell function. Approximately 25% COVID-19 patients increased IL-6 levels greater 1,000 pg/mL associated elevations canonical pro-inflammatory cytokines. Collectively, findings support hypothesis COVID-19 suppresses host functional adaptive innate immunity. Importantly, Interleukin-7 administered ex vivo restored cell IFN-ɣ production COVID-19 patients. Thus, ELISpot may functionally characterize host immunity COVID-19 inform prospective therapies. third world country America? RN here. Back March employer said same. allowed talk media. spell repercussions obvious. get tested antibodies instead guessing. study released today shows children age 10 good shedding transmitting virus adults. yeah, that's exact reason keep remote.

Edit: So.are arguing letting kids run schools? get job another country, please let know.. Sorry dont know normal americans.

 Canadiens. Normal wearing mask. Washing hands entering building. visiting friends family. leaving house work.

 new normal.

So yes, things back normal till vaccine comes out. Tell already tracked thru cell phone gg.  Sounds like 5 unfortunate years spent North Dakota. things ( massive corporations) don’t make complete turnaround think us doomed.. billionaires fine underground bunkers though.. least there’s that. envy recent time showed side America. Except... They'd dead...? What? vaccine would INSANELY profitable US. OK see saying...

In case, thing keep mind sensitivity test (that many copies RNA test detect). exact number depend virus looking for.

So, RNA test COVID19 2 weeks stopped showing symptoms, going negative... post replying someone saying told get RNA test 2 weeks symptoms, likely would show negative result.

Thanks clarifying, also appreciate discussion!  pre-orders start? less negligible.

A non-zero risk one willing take rapidly spreading deadly virus, especially high risk individual, go Disney World. Mhm. Ask fed man starving he'll tell story. Live truth mate. America sleepwalking ~~toward economic catastrophe due covid 19~~

It's amazing, country there, seems look like country, called country, sounds like country .... functioning like country. Yes multiple governors right thing, governors NY, NJ, CT, MA. Iirc governors OH MI also good things earlier sure lasted. CA's governor apparently well despite increasing numbers, I've read problem enforcement idk. also states good compliance low numbers general, like VT ME. Northeast general done well (aside high numbers earlier NY NJ). speak best area. Maybe. Americans definitely wear masks crowds cities. 

But also likelihood many people simply walking suburbia woods. Wearing mask hardly seems important contexts. scientists researchers say safe effective dudes Facebook say bill gates super weapon.

 know believe anymore. 17 36 days onset death records. That’s idea. doubled size garden February, watching world news regards Covid. used grow hot peppers hobby. year we’re also growing potatoes, onions, carrots, green beans, kale, chard, beets, super stubborn tomato may may work out. Luckily stores didn’t shut - originally feared. dad put moderna trial last week, I’m hoping get Pfizer AstraZeneca Miami, Florida native here. Masks mandatory here. Yes, US massive second wave, thoughts someone living heart wave 2 pandemic. 

Mask wearing legally enforced mandatory public spaces private businesses. 

Social distancing legally enforced. 

Maximum capacity laws much stricter. 

All bars dine restaurants shut down. 

All non-essential businesses closed.


Our cases blew up, particular Miami Dade, Broward, Palm Beach counties (which fastest growing state/country/worldwide) they’re South Florida, popular tourist areas. massive influx travelers wave 1 quarantine lifted. beaches/nightlife spots open like rest country, numbers went surpassed CDC reopening guildlines. police stops border along major highways limit state-to-state traffic isn’t necessary, didn’t shut airports. Massive amounts tourists flushed sole reason Florida cases skyrocketed. Taking advantage beaches/restaurants/bars reopened LOCALS, tourists came in, partied massive populations week, social dancing. tourism Florida young/party crowds ignorant facts. Beaches subsequently closed plenty people already spread other. Even 4th July, everything shut down. 

Both county state declared States Emergency. 


We following CDC Federal guidelines. [Actual example Palm Beach County began county wide mask enforcement again. [Palm Beach County 

Edit: spelling

Edit 2: saying should’ve checked IDs/enforced “locals only” guidelines.... 2.8 million people living Miami. It’s impossible check all, everything simply again. People dying covid best people. preexisting conditions. They're old. problems, people poor quality life say covid blessing. God calling back sick children.

Amen. anti-mask protesters Canada too, many. Sounds like somebody bought Pharma stock hoping profit COVID-19. Yeah people wear them. matter told to. Going death rate prior peak would looking 500 deaths per day Florida case level three weeks. sign rate growth cases slowing Florida, indication significant mitigation done slow rate growth. Quite opposite fact.

Experience around world shown healthcare system becomes overrun, deaths per case triple. Florida cusp transition. think even people reddit wrong idea freedom means. People taken idea far allow cause others damage. anti-maskers take logic slightly farther issue everyone morons imo.  medium.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

I’m guessing bigger clients got front line. time got application seems like money gone already. Sweden still racking 100-800 cases per day conditions 'defacto lockdown' aka Swedish summer vacation.

Swedish summer vacation means lockdown stricter social distancing before? That's funny considering live Stockholm there's way people March there's way fewer people seem care recommendations careful public.

Where think Swedish summer vacationers going? There's people ever vacation inside country opposed going abroad.  appears superior vaccine data believed less holds p3 Several years, decades research development vs 5 months known existence spearheaded big pharma companies know existed Jared Kushner. I'll pass bit. K already inside joke wife brother sister... real name Mark, call ""Corl"" behind back. 10k cases everyday Florida, lets assume fatality rate .5% generous, would 50 10k might end dead. another additional small number cases, every single life matters. 10k could part 50. allergist biologist, I'm going guess no. allergen like pollen fundamentally different structure virus. Maybe someone expertise also weigh in, though. Oh hahaha I’m stupid!

Yes agree Sweden acknowledged mistakes working fix it. However, country different compared ours. basis Swedes approach built ability socially distance. 2x population density Sweden (I compared countries whole populated cities, Stockholm vs. New York). Now, couple 20-40% population say ***don’t believe*** virus masks constitution, situation alien Sweden’s.

Edit: try research numbers use, admit 20-40% number guess. gathered polls I’ve seen whether Americans support masks social distancing percentage Trump’s fan base. need least look total tests reported day make statement. I've calling walking corpses me. windows even open. anyone gets we'll it. true. deaths higher overall Sweden, yes, look numbers, clearly downward trajectory deaths. now, need worry re-opening surge like every country does. Hey.. I'm florida I'm part problem vaccines cause headaches fever. unusual. Daycare area got whole cluster 20 getting it. friend works daycare, told she’s headaches sore throat, getting COVID test today. doctor upset worked somewhere indoors doesn’t get good ventilation. Pool testing could make lot sense teachers bigger warehouse type jobs Seems like reposts frequent past week. always report ‘em hopes sub looks bit cleaner. sub pretty okay regards compared others. states like Florida we’ll slashed $275 week. disparity states unemployment benefits crazy. feel bad kids too. Imagine parent cared little education thought couldnt get without someone else giving them. Oh gosh. Also make safety regulations nobody get high floor fall they’re going hurt people way down.  stop wishing everyone else. Lockdown kill far virus. Omg I’m this. Great idea. canada ordered 2 per person too

it's safe thing gives big margin error lot people may need two etc minor corrections:

1. amount state taxes deducted federal taxes capped $10,000 Trump “tax cuts” (regardless you’re filing single person married couple). standard deduction $12,000 single person $24,000 married couple deduction completely useless lot people.
2. Medicare tax 2.9% income (1.45% employee + 1.45% employer) Obamacare added additional 0.9% surcharge income $200,000 single people $250,000 married couples (for reason, Democrats love penalizing successful people getting married). Still seeing people walking store without masks on, hoping get let though! Grrrr. continue to. attack personally call idiot (internet words dont effect grown man) people offer new perspectives.

I making point everyone wearing N95 view mask would different, person commented government would seriously back could ramped production make reality thought good valid criticism considered. countries (maybe except Denmark) low population density social distancing normal behavior there. Even grocery store worker feels bad, recently stores refused enforce mask policy would get 50% people wearing masks. feels hopeless store busy would without pandemic daily, don’t even mention holidays had. It’s like everyone forgot there’s pandemic going around  Oh weird flu coronaviruses family virus? Oh they're not?! maybe shut fuck flu shot  went doc anti anxiety meds.  gave say, 'We working outside comfort zones.""  Yeah, shit. It’s human psychology, it’s fascinating thoughts actions manipulated often easily. think it’s completely normal, we’ve bombarded information, don’t know trust wether *anything* safe Never buy first model year car point, every medical expert plan non compliance comes emergency plans.

You can't control stupid point civilization actively plan idea normal part society now. Straight horse's estimates production million doses University Oxford's experimental COVID-19 vaccine September could underestimate depending quickly late-stage trials completed, researcher said there'll million doses around September. What's less predictable manufacturing scale-up incidence disease, there'll Idk actual anxiety puts higher risk succumb covid. Yall ever panic attacks? 

The fact guys shoot absurd. saw old lady get denied going store mask definitely looked like exception definitely trumper trying give system like many paint people be. 

It early ok tell people give life especially they're talking lasting years. 

So supposed never see light day without mask? wonder too. Remember Italy pleading world take seriously showing horrible death is? Well around 6k daily cases peak end March. USA 77k daily cases seeing media attention death like Italy. dunno add up, seems bizarre. LOT spread Facebook. masks, conspiracies virus itself. It’s simply astonishing people forward captioned pictures spread false information without sort critical thinking fact checking. It’s definition mind numbing.

[This making rounds weeks ago remember back early March people started getting really nervous would happen US. would always say think, ""oh it'll fine, United States, would never hit us hard""....now look are. Exactly! revealed many middle management literally useless like that. acting like simple take seriously don't. seems like married kids I'm sure I'm entertaining this, real life complicated side political spectrum fall on. wife liberal always differences opinion dive finer details things. works marriage. Yes fight this, honestly, fight every relationship, probably trying accomplish much together. I’ve calling pro-virus would fine dandy want drive covid cliff, problem covid contagious push people cliff instead you. know consents dying preventable death like do. Since illegality stopped admin? say  I'd say pretty normal still feel nervous. Social Anxiety likely exists many us long away others, foundational basis justify itself. frankly, interaction 100% safe anymore. States, numbers utterly atrocious now. 

That said, also keeps sane. social animals, better worse. understand truth: taking risk. cut like tumor. Trump children collegues went Ivy League schools. 

Lots stupid ""educated"" people.

You'd suprised many intellects ""undereducated"". saying gun wound counted COVID-19 death,

I discussing whether kind deaths considered covid-related. someone made exact statement.

That's saying dont agree. said several times clearly now, sure people seem telling cant say that? 100% bait. Quit writing disaster horror fanfic go take walk constant stream articles giving people impression vaccine right around corner helpful average person.   

We need work hard vaccine behaving never vaccine. Seasonal food allergies virus', no. Allergic reactions caused immune system reacting, need train react. “Available”? public? Yeah no. That’s month away roughly. Lol federal government care. reported older people respond well vaccine dose younger people. exploring upping dose phase 2b result. believe read bottleneck getting vaccine syringes still looks good.

Glass vial shortage. 

The US gets dibs 300 mil doses first batch. End year still seems doable us.  Interesting seems takes full month reach peak antibody levels shot.  So, guess means additional month vaccine social distancing masks. going die putting thin piece fabric face exactly going anyway? build large transfer facilities near border, truckers drop pick trailers truckers cross border time. think also pervasive belief US dominant winners oppressed losers - “we” want winners. It’s belief system develops trauma, scarcity mindset, lack collective trust community (all aspects building empires, way, world powers actively WWI country’s “parent country” Great Britain *really* good at). 

These dynamics still exist within country well. So, there’s fear vacating dominant, oppressive winner’s spot people think hold power believe someone else community begin oppressing instead - new winners. 

It infuriating inherently divisive. Many thanks! Virus: It’ll take least year half figure stop me!

Humans: haha vaccine printer go brrrr Risk catching disease 97% survival rate starve homeless that's true choice people US.  wonder choose risk disease. like want risk it, Americans really choice. know, I'm sorry .... but, sometimes people say crazy shit. 

I apologize unreservedly. 

Hugs? might work department Healthcare company realized sent us home effective working home. 

 employer idiot state live control. became sandwiched two states whose numbers began Spike people continued fight mask mandate. spikes caused us go back lockdown. people pissed, like would listened first time would still open. 

Out state visitors supposed quarantine 14 days happening. downtown area big tourist area full people refuse wear masks. I've lost count many codes I've in. Never pharmacist come bedside. dataCenter state info Diseases better Control spread read something USA Today weeks ago property taxes gonna go like 33%. true? Adding onto this, phase 1 mean ""it develops antibodies nobody dies"" phase 2 means ""the antibodies fights coronavirus"" phase 3 ""no long-term effects""? mistaken? don’t know you’re talking about, wreckage human remains Flight 93 much found: 

Look “aftermath” section. Ignore poop guy. strong great thing. Presume send developing countries well, probably mainly commonwealth nations like Kenya, South Africa, Nepal etc

Edit: Nepal isn’t commonwealth, apologies Right Americans generally assholes (I American) many behaving themselves. think going closely correlated normal years. Well fuck that's fantastic year ago, owners got wheeled operating room surgeons gloves masks, bet would freak fuck out. changed?

I swear, odd arbitrary hill choose die (literally). godspeed scientists Rest Peace hero Anyone sense, everything works out, vaccines would available general public scale?

It says September seems crazy given haven’t Phase 3 trial yet wont even know 6 month efficacy then. January seems much realistic. hurdle creating vaccine looks over.

now next biggest hurdle distributed? rich countries get first? third world countries stand wringing hands waiting turn? rich elite get first even first world countries? He's even running business badly. could one enormously bad year financially followed couple great years recovery. decade recession/depression. worst take I've seen day. Kemp dumbass, assume malice stupidity suffice. Yeah get ""shut down"" bit.  dining restaurants, movie theaters closed three weeks everyone acted like went quarantine hell.  Quarantine what, Latin ""forty days"". Nobody shut anything forty days. purchased 8 scratch offs wife bought 5 drawings MegaMillions tomorrow night. hope think I'm kidding said 2 others I've promised stuff win tomorrow lol. True. disaster declaration included Humanitarian law pretty vital preventing social collapse. probably going get messy, though. utility bills 80% rent go away; come due beginning 60 days State Emergency ends. lasts year, debt staggering. Anti science movement well Facebook. Although make worse providing echo chambers. compiles data Johns Hopkins. top 9 states total deaths per 1M locked start. data. I’m basing conclusions data. can’t ask questions right? California never came lockdown massive spike. Kawasaki even fairly rare.

This seems even rarer. true. speaking language give work residency visa. Getting residency work visas China much harder China US. see photo right here: We're bamboozled, hes bed Yeah right it’s pointless waste time arguing someone completely unreasonable. However, might keep opening trap ignorant thought much. means that’s better someone isnt sure believe..so theres positive!  loosely connected several cases past month, finally got call I've expecting. Someone know hospital confirmed case. Prognosis good.

Fuck covid.

Edit : physical proximity immediate family relevant time frames. said, fuck covid. It’s enforced. People strolling masks around necks like sort talisman. reporting time 'additional deaths' (compare amount deaths day previous years) nobody cared. Since increased testing estimates made AFAIK, estimate 1:46 testing outside essential workers hospitalized patients done. ohio, health director would plead hospitals labs report cases immediately. apparently not, health department working old data.   don’t name baby immediately birth. sedated 24 hours. Hell, would still impressive early 2021 lie, need fire fairness, campaign poorly run. collected signatures get ballot nothing else. media blitz, zero ads, organized debates anything. Considering would quintupled size state governments budget expected fail without organized informational campaign Synairgen press release today indicating 79% reduction people needing ventilation (albeit huge study), good day UK science!  guess question is, be? tiresome read shit every thread

Feel free venture corners internet..

Here's good one: 

Maybe liking. Read article. 40 percent 22 identified superspreaders asymptomatic. speculative statement. That’s terrible, I’m sorry. Try find way avoid going building first weeks things shut again. saw Oklahoma's governor sick. wear mask Trump Tulsa rally seemed escape. saw pics ten days ago shopping Walmart mask.

Looks like cavalier attitude finally caught him. Wonder change though? that? Brilliant. time larger international studies countries like US, Brazil, India, Russia South Africa. agree. I'm getting ready second resurgence, either summertime activities/people going Disney etc., September rolls around.

I'm hoping ""new normal"" changed habits buy us enough time appropriately deal without open satellite hospitals like again.  residents still congregate every day without wearing masks. turn volume radio dance squares. crowd bars songs Elvis Presley Bobby Sherman play. picnics water aerobics classes.
 
Heavens forbid wear thin piece fabric front face. That's clearly onerous ask. ACA made illegal health insurance companies deny medical coverage raise rates due pre-existing condition.

and current administration trying make ACA illegal. fair warning. ease restrictions responsibly first wave. happen AUS?

This Italy (and EU) issues. go discos Italy (but think change soon).



However, mass events still canceled, still need mask go closed space (you remove mask sitting restaurant). case aus? topic. still talking drug save lives. concerned access. part equation. say intense cold winter freeze kill virus.

- trump months meant non-suspicious? People reason believe it? People think think they’re asymptomatic? going test people intentionally bring positivity rate down? guess don’t get (a) would useful high positivity area (unless agenda downplay virus decreasing positivity rate, (b) people low enough risk believe don’t getting tested. hate this. straight tell people tine don’t give fuck somebody work. ""So son science project unionized particles and..."" think depends state. Here, filed paid weekly. last payment next week.  absolutely ridiculous! I’m allowed make judgement own. **No one tell party!**” People recently expressed lot concern ""immunity last."" points topic:

1. *still* scientifically confirmed case re-infection, type anecdotal stories circulating since March. research animals still good levels antibodies immune re-infection attempts. See News report ""antibodies last"" exaggerated. actual research bit mixed, seen three papers suggesting antibodies last two suggested do, Wuhan study (saying antibodies fade quickly) poor methodology - based estimated cases, actually follow people swabbed positive. three smallish sample sizes. inclined trust New York study nearly 20,000 participants good methodology, found **90% antibody prevelance 3 months follow up**, line know coronaviruses. (Out coronaviruses studied, SARS1 MERS antibodies lasted two years, would bit surprising -but impossible- SARS2-COVID antibodies lasts months. )
3. Even detectable antibodies, mean immunity. already evidence regarding cell immunity, see ""Robust cell immunity convalescent individuals asymptomatic mild COVID-19"" cell immunity may enough prevent re-infection altogether, dramatically reduce severity symptoms.
4. Memory cells long term players immune system. body register virus memory cells, even circulating antibodies, body still quickly produce demand (upon re-exposure virus). thing happen Covid, believe studies yet ethical re-expose recovered humans lab animals' antibody levels still high test effect.

Edit: Thanks Silver! Also, relevant vaccine info: ""Oxford Expert Claims COVID-19 Vaccine Gives Long Term Immunity Antibodies 3X Higher Recovered Patients"" usual followed typical ""hurr durrr"" comment. Right time. lot time 3000 extra dollars. built new deck. may need once, may get broken lost.

We've actually ordered 190m doses total various vacine projects.  First, stated ""Flu,"" spin anyway want jumping screaming calling that. And, noted wasn't.

Further, making assumption like almost every pandemic (small large) every hit man. Eventually, burn out. Bubonic Plaque killed 1/3 Europe infected it, 55-65% would died. keep killing people reach herd immunity. mass pandemics. Swine flu infected approximately 60 million Americans - certainly near herd immunity. certainly nearly deadly. But, said virus pandemics like Asian Flu, Hong Kong Flu, etc. tend burn prior herd immunity. mean appear sometimes means become less issue.

COVID near deadly Spanish Flu variety reasons including fact 100 years modern medicine. But, end day pandemics tend burn out. tend hit areas, or, minimum hit said areas level impact said areas previously hard hit.

Lastly, presented evidence support claim act like Spanish Flu say making assumption, said statement well...oh, wait linked least supporting evidence. merely decided wrong witty ""red truck"" analogy.

Now, said, take reading comprehension note words used post prior posts. used words like ""generally"" ""tend"" similar language demonstrating problem absolutist bullshit spewed see pandemic. Believe plenty times pharmacists gown patients’ rooms. Especially codes. also don’t forget face face sick people every day working retail. can't imagine school this. way. still that. child, needs pull bootstraps learns walk.  Re: Moderna, moaning share sales execs. Moderna stock, think interested whether vaccines works quickly brought market. US gov't invested $500m them. send soldiers battle tell supply gear fend themselves?

or

we spend countless billions equipment, training, risk analysis, logistics, intel, etc...?

people cavalier situation, increased risk beyond regular citizen expected handle alone. Nope, go straight 'fuck tit cancer' especially dude. It’s demographics. cases young people. 

The hypothesis young cases cause old cases. So, far, happened. It’s good news. contractor aca kicked individual coverage went $100 month 6000 deductible $250 month 10,000 deductible. Couldn’t afford anymore. snowball going get **BIG** There's common misconception less people dying disease deaths going US. Thing is, deaths time high states surging cases. One exception found Georgia. FL, AZ, TX, CA, AL time highs covid deaths. Wonder long take? ""Beyond veil: mask requirements place Florida?"" even end June July.

Enforcement sporadic, loopholes orders.

How else explain 10k cases day 5 days? Noooo, must shadowy conspiracy ABOARD HAHAHAHAHA  gives flying fuck education?

Uhhh, should! Think it. education means fewer dumb societal mistakes wearing masks later. Education valuable thing offer upcoming generation, absolutely cost think pales comparison cost uneducated society. 

I seriously hope don’t truly think kids’ education get fucked. so, sounds like you’re uneducated one true. 

For example, 100% sort side effects. covid give 100% people symptoms.  good news could hoped for. start getting timeframe up, even one largely speculative help immensely relieve mental pressure. One hardest things outbreak feeling never end. makes want give doomed part lives forever even try? let people die?

Now know lockdowns, keep case numbers low. beat beat next year. announcement also comes time another UK study (the UK killing it) found another medicine reduces need ventilators 79%.

I genuine hope once, nice feeling. isolation people taking advice probably fine. issue opening floodgates kind behavior lot people either denial health status bound one unlucky gets bad despite healthy otherwise. one person takes advice, sure probably fine. 330m take things ugly US already wake call. Florida recently broke world record covid cases. they’ve reopened Disneyworld. aus, sent half Victoria full lockdown back homeschool etc 200 cases day. entirety US many cases every 5 10 minutes. much free-dumb injected brain, bleach? New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts COVID deaths per million: 1200. Florida: 200. Texas: 138. 

I live Miami. Everyone masked following protocol, you’re allowed inside store without mask, people allowed inside time, business even remain completely closed including banks, exactly unwilling do? force COVID positive patients back nursing homes? answer?

Not mention CDC admits mixing antibody viral test results, knows else they’d make someone like look good. Yeah fuck celebrating less sickness country! large spikes/increases cities states see heavy protesting. Yeah, updated week ago iirc. Symptomatic IFR 1.00% total 0.65%. mad, taking utterly stupid position feel smug.


No way. significant number people think unrelated emergency, dont get saved Covid means hospital full up, counted Covid death.

I think silly. Tip fedoras think point wearing masks political statement less ignorance. told lie idiot masks work, likely hospitals could government maintain stockpiles. idiot murdered thousands.  

Trump wear one 4+ months often find people camera aimed wearing masks, even they're alone. effective mask, harder talk remain cool mask. It'll take 4+ months posts like seeing people TV wearing masks undo done.  

Since lie likely cover government neglect, masks political statement. give free meals. teachers? schools stay open without teachers? “World good. America bad.” - sub know we've seen pictures daylight demarcation line scalp face clearly visible em vote republican..it is. please, get :O employees store five bucks Please post/comment music links. 


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Unless somehow petulant toddler president legal pad executive orders titled ""I king want""... Pro-life what? lives what? can’t hear sound hypocritical swirling vortex pulling away reality! people hear news still support Gov. Georgia? pretty much say going taking vaccination time given proper counterpoint friend act people naked Times Square *right now*. work nursing home. essential also. 

Don't feel bad taking risks rewards. 

It would help though essentials would go work. thought supposed evidenced based speculation based? Hm.

He clearly saying best case scenario something basing anything don't. highest % 17ish that's non-random skewed sample.

Tests one half month ago, noticed post today, cases doubled since May probably anti-bodies now. yeah, agree still yeah. know seen? retraction either giant FHM supporting groups Facebook. OTOH, original statement Sweden might 40% quite popular. work: make bold, unsupportable proclamations go viral corrections make nearly much impact.

Ah mean thing trying every day? Maybe wrote working. Difference even though know corrected, still go next post spread lie trying make true. seen two places (svt omni), hardly check news days. told journalist best case scenario news usual spin. Well wisdom experience people get divorce unless someone sexual intercourse someone else. know bullshit. Plus know SWAYED research easy get whatever answer want CALLED ""research"". Fuck people came elsewhere including NJ made fucking bad couldn’t stay home go beach play beer bong bark like dogs sorts ridiculous shit — name uncle Ruckus relation ... make prescisely statements. would assume he’s know? intuition? ""Starting"" lol mostly circle jerk since mid March Masks pretty fucking standard round here. Fuck stats go outside look around idiots. Well still haven’t killed aca. know, know. joke, probably bad one. get anti-vax. thoroughly diligent federal response would still tens thousands deaths unfortunately. 

Just picking handful frame range, deaths implied per capita deaths germany / canada / uk would 36k / 77k / 221k US point.

But obviously US ontrack lot sadly. deaths yesterday per million US 1.24, 0.01 / 0.1 / 0.4 countries... HVAC Okay let's back FUCK buddy, better watch mouth.

He orange hair, lump us gingers fat fuck!  Trump Papa Berenstain global leaders lol  enough you? think lot countries said masks little effect worried supplies emergency workers beginning. 

Which interesting. become upset governments lie us effort manipulate us?

Especially backfires spectacularly? Ny mask mandatory takes approximately three months past get trapped river foresight string rope across river low. takes another week accidentally eat something poisonous, develop severe food poisoning improperly stored game meat. probably people getting jobs back reopenings lost pandemic

and possibly lost jobs again. fast enough one person get tens new jobs month gonna put federal agents mask duty?

Maybe could roam streets unmarked vehicles abscond people wearing masks. disease real. created lizard people take planet. Trump one them, want people wear masks wants schools full. goal kill many humans possible lizards take control. /S Answering machine full. much prayin away rona Nah don’t. study medicine different university. however really like vaccine don’t see getting *any* coverage annoys little read comment another thread saying trains immune system recognise viruses, could completely fight future flu strains example. sure helps question yet good portion people think part giant conspiracy either poison people tag tracking devices. made mandatory, made slight difference far. see people shop wear wear correctly, even people put fuss come nose.

I think mandates effective teeth. There's fine penalty complying, besides stores right refuse service you. I'm executioner here. That's covid. getting punished every day. hand it. 

At point I'm shocked took cities long governor still give fuck. actually think American government cover regardless wins November. (avoiding bot) happened re-elected, would want economy restarted (since that’s thinks aside golf), candidate won, would make available free healthcare. orange makeup rubs off. Yep, might get placebo. idea ""restrictions"" help slow spread virus. Ah yes, ol' reddit hug death. isn't. areas us poorly. areas are, been, quite well. prefer shit heads No, late stage trials Oxford vaccine conclude fall large scale manufacturing distribution set goes well. everyone else taking vaccinations widely available incorrect. Really read articles coming today say even best case scenario Phase III trial goes hiccups vaccines available next year end year *possibility*. Ahahaha dream living America anymore We’ve got laws

Keyword: *laws*

Is Congress hurrying write mask mandate Trump sign? Omg people really started drinking bleach? Awww dumbfuckistani actually thinks US sends aid altruistic reasons lmfao.

Imagine calling countries ""shit tips"". arrogance, hubris, absolute self righteous exceptionalism, hallmarks people dumb know they're dumb ignorant bigots. karma karma. bad sacrifice 140k counting, still learn anything pitfalls blind pride. 

Shit tip country indeed, coming country can't handle something simple wearing masks, something shit tips able without dumb fucks about.  Trump cousin probably. Must nice leadership national level. put masks people. Jesus stops prevents spread virus least levels wont wind ICU - even lucky get treated due overcrowding dumb asses causing!! still forgive forget fellow dumbass americans. fucking idiots  people NY eating restaurants outside stopped wearing masks altogether. fuck?  USA even laughingstock world. bad everyone feels sorry us. Thanks Trump! know varies state state, (Minnesota) obligation take job field/level last one. example, worked good, salaried job disappeared, forced apply minimum wage jobs keep collecting unemployment. required look jobs matching experience/education.

If employer calls back, still gotta go though. wonder facebook group... never said lock down. said wear masks now, wear masks past, wear masks state wide exceptions.

NY worse yes, control. Florida become new NYC fraction population density. psychopath lol US big country, half US states mandated masks public places.  

Not mention top 9 retailers country done same. - woohoo, capitalism saves day! /s modprobe /lib/vac/covid.ko.20 Finally something knock Oxford Comma pedestal. Oxford Vaccine time. happen US saying? ""I smart"" Good point.

I guess there'd inefficiency mass producing wrong vaccines, assuming resources could used develop working one instead.

I expect Bill Gates knows lot mass producing vaccines though!

I guess strategy here, far enough research phase (and looking promising) start mass production case passes trial, theory, trial successful got 100 million doses ready go day trial completes.  I'm happily working home since since late February. I'm incredibly fortunate company values employee safety happiness; actually get management-level permission go offices, officially closed (at least U.S.).

Back early March, Corporate made emergency weekend transition Microsoft Teams moved full steam ahead make everyone comfortable working home. Results: loss productivity, loss income stream, reduced operating travel expenses. tentative plans re-open sometime August/September, executive team encouraging everyone keep working home preference.

There even tentative plans continue saving money future reducing travel long-term reducing square footage offices, we've shown mobile workforce feasible. greatest obstacle transition always client reluctance let project teams work remotely, pandemic finally blew away mindset.   right front you. politicians take massive entities. entities denied environmental catastrophe, pushed simplistic view economy, crushed unions, campaigned keep children factories schools, etc. Maybe all, try hide harm cause abroad. Regardless, show disregard common person disregard sometimes even long term interests. money quickly finds pockets centuries old American movement.

We know happens. 

Why then, told look outside country cause 30 years old order explain event looks exactly like business usual industrialized America, severe? individual US states bigger countries... whatever, long less 1k per dose....oh, see mean Also unlike U.S., countries believe mass gatherings safe even everyone wears mask, even gathering good cause.  

 think element American exceptionalism makes us believe we're safe virus we're right side politically - whether anti-mask idiots, people spreading virus nightly protests rallies across country. needs talked more.

Whenever think identify insincere actor call typical response is

1. Oh anyone disagrees bot?

2. paranoid fuck

Don't let aggressive defensive tactics make lose concern. may well parroting BS heard, equally possible bad actor.

The truth bad actors best diplomatic skills. rocket scientists. given set talking points use intensely negative extreme language get people riled responsive. also continue argue use ""Whataboutism"" lot, old soviet tactic. 

They especially want bait RACE MISOGYNY. want us think [redacted] protests caused southern Covid explosion. prey people already racist tendencies make feel like they're alone. prey [redacted] dislike rurals southerners, start using ugly slurs describe people (hicks, inbred, Idiocracy) try get [redacted] start hating more. 

We need come together recognize matter problems, let Russians whisper poison ears tear country apart. 

I also see extreme negativity lately regarding ""collapse"" ""shithole"" ""3rd world"" country US supposedly is. Again, organic see ton exact phrases used brand new users sometimes. message is, ""Give up. country sucks. hate place live garbage country."" 

Don't let this. hate what's happening much everyone else, reality Americans decent people care want help families neighbors. There's percentage completely nutso. make us garbage country. would Federal Judge -- probably one Hawaii -- ruling unconstitutional within 2 hours. Yea, that's reality situation. I'm way old kind high school bullshit.

It still felt good vent it. never outgrow that. 

Thanks supportive comments, you. means lot ""these trying times"" know I'm alone make effort get head ass, pay attention (virtual) community around me, pay forward.

Everybody needs reminded deserve better abuse. buddy im answering essay prompt you, dont give shit instructions. give shit people DYING technology capitalism fucks everyone over. dont dumb think relate one another. Well, want Joe president.

But want live, I'll vote that's choice cancer. heart might also control group. buy Napa they'll replace wipers free. least DeSantis lazy ass done shit letting counties cities fend themselves. Good way avoid blame, well try to. Luckily counties county doesn't, city might say fuck like Lakeland Polk Tampa Hillsborough. bars started selling hot dogs crackers cheese. Second wave would something like, virus control country, starts peaking due winter borders opening. Yea got kickass produce it. Way grow staples long term storage kale harvested indefinitely. make one big suggestion already done look growing foodscapes perennials trees building fruit tree guilds. One factor I'm looking next house anti fragile system ability grow one less 5 years. Masks mandatory majority USA. USA government system STATES, (semi-autonomous regions) charge laws. states require them.

It’s like saying EU doesn’t mandatory masks? Crazy right? great, also noted never used before, caution there.

But I'm sure future most/all vaccines. People like everywhere Canada. bare faces protesting likely see though. That's typically types aggression here; passively. agree 100% nothing wrong taking year off. think miss teaching. want support decision, don’t know one. Thank effort answering :)

Things dont like US: student loans (no free education), expensive healthcare, necessity car (i dont enjoy driving)

Things like: Big diverse nation (Geographically culturally), cheap stuff, recreational weed

Cheap stuff sort clashes free education healthcare guess

Now also heard problems guns afroamerican ghettos guess bad ppl say. cities world dangerous districts right?  Best news Agreed. viable treatments exist contracting potentially kill you, vaccine proves effective, office place model needs put hold. depressing is, probably right ngl. hallucinations padded room somewhere.

No, freshly created reddit account thought vaccinate kids rotavirus days? latest case/death charts hope fucking covid 19 gets eliminated. put life pause suicidal thoughts............ mind-boggling many companies insisting office attendance right now. lowest hanging fruit, allow employee reasonably work home. know indoor transmission thing spreading vast majority. 

My husband working home since mid-March. company always pretty relaxed WFH, historically been. *convinced* he'd back office end May, happy wrong here. far, last official communication we've indicates we'll home least September. I'm pretty sure I'm home 2021, suspect might too. 

On hand, husband's younger sister works company much harder hit state. boss let employees WFH April May, ordered everyone back office (or face immediate termination) first week June. Cases steadily gotten worse area, change mind despite fact 90% company could easily WFH. nuts.  awesome news. I’m glad we’re seeing sort glimmer hope. But, still long ways go phase 3 trials starting August. even longer go till enough doses made stymie pandemic. 

My bigger concerned already predict nonsense, bullshit, misinformation spread result today’s similar articles. 


These predictions see Facebook within 1week:

“About 70% people got Covid-19 vaccine reported fatigue 68% reported headache.” translate something like, infected new virus, that’s bodies reaction micro chip.


“This method, called recombinant adenovirus vector, platform theoretically work many kinds viruses.” translate something like, man made makes dangerous. 

I can’t go Neanderthal enough work 5G, Mercury sulphate, Bill Gates, I’m sure there’s combination there. part Schengen Zone, though. So, probably border policies. literally worst nightmare Exactly.

Until Oxford fully passes Phase III zero issues, whole news middling. Even PM Boris Johnson came earlier said confident. One people told suspects deaths due causes, like accidents, cancers, etc. labeled covid deaths ""there agenda exaggerate situation"". given arguing people always come bizarre reasons justify denial. believe care somebody love gets virus, probably late. Cucumbers full CHEMICALS 

r/TechnicallyTheTruth never gave people attention. 99%?! Really? Wow, basically, vaccine Considering live part country swarming mosquitoes, good news! good it. Lmao Spicoli! Yes, back muskets cannons. care many ARs people stockpile, government tanks, drones, nukes. Armed revolution longer possible bit gamble ordering 100 million vaccines becoming unusable better strategy ordering wait month produced. way works (which looking likely), rolled almost instantly. Food already skyrocketing America healthy proven infectious!

/s Yes both, since re-elected  matter do, killing American people dick waving contest eachother. USA feels cucked hasn’t killed enough people internationally recent years finally waging biological political warfare people. Meanwhile half population worships mad China ruining lives lolololololololol. live Florida expect wear masks everywhere rest possibly short life. Thank you! heads far asses US assume counting wearing mask. ask works time, don’t need laws. Laws supposed force people don’t like future benefit cannot see. time wasted persuading don’t think basic logic, people die.  cannot wait people page act, especially overall education level relatively low. either late cost much. Sweden. 
I think important part also fact Nordic countries generally stay home work feeling sick without fear losing job significant part income. US, case, makes sense make masks mandatory. work. People can't afford sit home 10 days getting pay wait test result might even accurate. initial promise, UK gets first production. idea still stands, find sources saying 2020 distribution ""equitable"". ever look death eye?

As matter fact, have, multiple times; that's started treating death respect deserves.

You might less 1% chances die still 20x times chances permanent damage body, passing virus people actually die (and pass virus, ect).

Can't stay inside little year wear mask ? France, life almost back normal. Meth head would've done better job. find copper weirdest places, think find stash N95 masks 3:30 AM? blue research bar Plague Inc. game almost full Yeah am, saw someone post photos videos party like 20 people so, like sheesh moronic be? Damn always knew sub full self righteous doomsaying pricks Explain he’s fucking America. Trump hasn’t listened suggestions tell it’s fault guy calling shots. Tell me. happy high COL people boned, think sucks. highlights weird straight $600 payment was.

I chiming one ""income increased"" people. see people mention situation time here, never hear anyone else it. media's job essentially promote fear gain clicks. would care public compliance? scared, keep clicking every new relevant article. park? *cough*DisneyWorld*cough* thanks, would rather covid cancer /s want get adickted. contact tracer? vaccine called Chad, amazing saying immunity?  Great.  I've already exposed, need vaccine mask. Sighs...


EDIT: points moved impose mask mandates reverse reopening, numbers expected reflect eating vegetables good us? I’m shocked. 

Slow news day? Lol source/link excess death count? I've trouble locating that.

I found something CDC (based calculations) says ~143k extra US deaths mid June. sure I'm looking right place. CDC site hard Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* think UK company doubt they're trials America would save world's economy. team would immortalised history. politicians afforded many luxuries average citizen get (i.e. access private schools, Healthcare, etc.) guys forced use services constituents used (public schools, paying healthcare) shit would hell lot better around here. directly impact them, care. care family get sick, impact them. care strip ACA healthcare, impact them. care small business get relief check, impact them. don’t see good ending this. make sure page goes back, still terrified her. American, I’m happy it’s American company that’s close. It’s much difficult Trump fuck everyone. I’m sure still us, hopefully rest world doesn’t suffer shit. Here's Texas latest case/death thing. commented targeted part government done mandate coverage. course healthcare system general horrible. see pandemic ending? (suggestion - use science, history logic solution)

Then create timeline today ending see what's going happen. (same suggestion above).

My timeline vaccine available 2023, widely consumed mid 2024. 

By mid 2021 virus run course US, Sweden, India, Brazil operating 80% capacity pre-COVID.

In meantime virus continue slow spread countries reopen catch resulting one two outcomes - choose shutdown mid 2024 resulting near actual economic collapse, resulting mass riots protests political upheaval eventually reopen US Sweden due economic necessity catch terms cases fatalities runs course them. slim chance people work looking defy opinion... concerned masks all. 

Well, that's sad thought. well could true. Prayers woman children.  husband complete piece shit though.  wife pregnant (by default means immunocompromised) allow encourage keep job dental hygienist middle pandemic?  mention works probably works home. risk life life unborn child could dental hygienist?  That’s messed up. 
Men country complete waste. According article they’re actually looking enroll 30,000 US trial, three times many they’re enrolling UK.

It’s virus much better control UK they’ll get much better data test somewhere actually high risk catching virus... Chris favorite director since Memento, wish nothing good luck. looks like total shit sandwich though. Would love direct streaming, course he’s romantic stan movie theatre experience. nice proud country change, we've really covered glory pandemic. downvoted asking question smh Why? employer right thing, I'd grateful this. assume comment they're covering cost testing, they're making work environment much safer minimal inconvenience. AstraZeneca committed providing millions doses vaccine developed Oxford not-for-profit basis crisis over.

[Press Sure that’s fine. entire post article saying shut us though. isn’t right way go it. We’re wearing instructed. governor could definitely better job, agree that. can’t punished governors decisions, article insists happen. sister says virus reported, cases bad media says, vaccine track you. Jesus. probable contract virus driving AC?-- Assuming driving around strangers time course. thinking whether wearing mask driving actually useful going back forth head. anyone provide insights? true South Asian countries testing anywhere near much richer countries. looking positive ratios, e.g., India 7-8%, badly either. Due poorer less connected outside world, virus hit much later compared Europe North America. Also, testing explain Pakistan's cases deaths falling. Daily new cases deaths fallen around two-thirds month ago. would also imagine time passes, every country would increasing testing capacity, country clear falling trend real. hand, countries increasing cases like India states US, uncertainty whether testing capacity increasing faster slower rate increase cases. english war time saying. ""Home christmas"" I'd say newspaper story around report. Plenty around here. link actual study could flair. bad one flair added. hallucinations padded room somewhere. Phase II expands children older people

Edit add - South Africa, also gave bunch people HIV said saw strong immune responses people. results published part future peer reviewed study think New Jersey too? entirely sure Could age? Im 33, pregnant boom FB feed happening 3-4 years now. swear y’all don’t clicking love one sciencey types

when type like else really expect? people vote...and breed Here's Florida's latest case/death charts, running 7-day great upward curves continues. vaccines years testing research behind them. fuck. bothered. chuckle it. picture coming downvote me. Cambridge University announced pivoting towards supporting COVID-19 offered virus anything may need, even cup tea fancies one. ""More two thirds nearly 100 Nevada offenders housed privately-run Arizona facility tested positive coronavirus, according Nevada Department Corrections (NDOC).

Of 99 inmates Sagurao Correctional Facility Eloy, Ariz. tested, 69 positive coronavirus."" Fuck hello hyperinflation  Trump already rolling secret police snatch protesters streets, seems like they’re anticipating this. Stock market still fine. place one group. Well NHS UK looking 500,000 participants closer to, ""one guy suffer ~~millions~~ 1,400"". although difficult do, blood tests T-cells (memory cells immune system). that's study did. tested blood 23 people SARS, hopes predicting long immunity lasts covid19. infection people required. Thank detailed reply guys delay process bit? Like, September? air college starts August dont wanna go (; _ ;) ""My career human life"" Okay dude. Keep believing extreme poverty country due personal choices, personal choices alone. That's reductionist purposefully blind reality lives working poor.

And tried personalize it, I'm applying statement - save, need justify anything keyboard warrior thinks Ayn Randian principles fact. working poor speak.  instance, CDC said people deaf hard-of-hearing opt clear face coverings.

How actually help? makes lot sense thank explaining it. won’t hold breath. hospital Kansas recently, repairing ct scanner. brought symptomatic Covid patient scan, coughing brains wearing mask. None techs wearing masks gloves either. took bedding used said patient threw next sink done. 

About week later felt like shit couple days nobody would test didn’t enough symptoms symptoms weren’t severe enough. can’t get test exposed covid patient negligent handlers, doubt I’m going able get vaccine. ""at time everyone sure anything""... importance masks already known. China already started acquiring stocks worldwide. Peoople already knew masks important offered relevant protection. already started wearing despite French government recommendations it. Pharmacies forbidden selling masks public. today thousands court cases lodged French government members, blaming taking wrong decisions endangered lives. judging retrospectively, exposing fact people already knew, acknowledging responsibilities accountability people power paid make decisions whole country. Thank you. banned? I've said before, part strategy.

As go 60-100% capacity, people feel like things getting worse. There's new news cycle every day something write about. 100-200-500% capacity feels like same: ""the hospitals full"". full last week. They'll full next week. Whether people dying home hard measure easy cover up, we'll ignore it. simpler convince people dead grandma outlier fix problem. becomes boring news, there's room Trump media machine start shifting things right direction him.

It'll take long time count excess deaths properly, certainly longer November. people debate whether excess deaths corona-related political sphere even then. It'll make nice NYT story 60% country enjoy 2022. wish started taking classes January. jumped secondary career path different education years ago looking end 15-year run, pivot. I'll making pivot anything get. received link youtube video via family text months ago. don’t facebook moment. sure problem me.

Anyway, google, likely find video least get idea about.

If not, *disgraced scientist* goes topics anti-vax, anti-mask, anti-fauci, anti-B&amp;MGates... remember correctly (and might due head injury) statement made something like wearing mask causes people rebreathe air activating latent virus. implied people infected coronaviruses animals via vaccines. paints victim mean rich people. mentions book wrote. Says autism cured. Says scientists made ebola infect human cells. wouldn’t. government George Soros want implant tracking unit fast possible. Wake sheeple
/s Thanks hard work! masks.

Germany had/has paid sick leave, Kurzarbeitergeld, doctors notice stay home 14 days telephone call. Local health care offices place TTI pandemic started, Local officials shying away put whole villages blocks quarantine need be. Re-Opening orienteered around binding scientific criteria instead political goals. Also hospital system complied (having choice) emptying hospitals curb spread. Everything nicely coordinated behind curtains competent federal govt.

Last least social death Germany public person spread obvious misinformation like common parts anglosphere. That's roughly equivalent 300-person protest US actually... newsworthy, right. Miracle = vaccine September according developers. Fed print meanwhile.  way talk Dutch Yo fuck that, hope county offers cost everyone...let's good world. Thanks answering, appreciate it. 

Also another follow question, could lead price fluctuation markets? could side effects? Thank you! stopping red lights article says chanting ""defund police"".  agree might belong here. But... Whatever found vaccine months ago. Now, chips... tricky part!  THAT'S MA'AM YOU

;) people willing put voluntarily, yes. need mandatory masks. 


It’s so....not explainable people don’t us voluntarily. 


I glasses mask dog like hell. Still, wear one. rather tad bit uncomfortable, infect someone. It’s *that* hard....  mean, Phase 1 2 results, good half results need, shows vaccine safe, shows produces antibodies, T-Cells. figure Antibodies T-Cells actually fight reinfection. /r/chadsriseup always assumed start mass producing trials complete. way always taking big risk losing bunch money? normally done could bring forward timeline? flattening. acceptable daily. ""a real thing happening real person"" ignore facts, deny reality, pretend everything rainbows unicorn farts?

People America ***TODAY*** downplaying seriousness calling hoax, rest world recovering it. 
Fuck feeling, shit serious needs taken seriously. can’t imagine perfect ending 2020 vaccine named Chad saving us. #LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!! Aids, take immunsystem blockers, would allow eat food allergic again? fact even need push telling enough anyone. 

Why rely chain stores like Wal Mart, Home Depot, etc right thing? didn’t vote stores, aren’t representing constituent. It’s like Congress forgotten represent fellow Americans businesses. Funds also used supply businesses promise abide CDC guidelines certificate. That's right. Instead providing schools virtual learning, Parson's would rather stupid piece framed paper displayed lobby businesses. Cue Rocky music montage. really hope there's BBC/Netflix documentary film crew capturing right now. successful could rival moon landing terms scientifically achievement historical importance Medicare Medicare. True question really. question soon citizens get it. Lakers cowboys definitely get regular Joe. fuck Kelly Loeffler

You meant figuratively literally? Obviously vaccine needs approved first, like we're going start production then. There's lot money banking vaccine works production already started, that's I'm saying. Distance learning cause developmental difficulties children, retention issues many, cause “long term psychological trauma.” That’s interpreted differently depending direction center lean.  info beds info Florida's ICU  Apparently vaccine uses engineered virus deliver SARS-CoV-2 spike protein generate immune response. anyone tell method better mRNA-1237 vaccine? mRNA-1237 vaccine relies cells' machinery generate spike protein mRNA that's injected, wonder matter time efficacy immune response. Meh, think cost countries willing bet on. Either way funds research Oxford probably likely places world come vaccine anytime soon.

I imagine costs pre-ordering months delay astronomically exceed cost ordering chance money wasted. Really? It’s interesting you’ve seen people change Tucson. Flagstaff seems less people wearing before, people wearing town. get vaccine September would absolutely ridiculous. amount work takes, can’t fathom it. I've opposite revelation working, least area live in. people come without masks ones always really weird obnoxious customers seem serious mental problems. average shopper mask understands reasons wearing one, even might find uncomfortable

I live NoVA FWIW  article back May. getting posted? slept many underage French prostitute. guy character. always wondered would met young Tallyrand, they're similar. think America's impending economic crash entirely fault Putin Trump, paying attention American economic policy past 40 years. agree! hate it, people see local news saying need go work 2 - 3 jobs McDonalds make need pay bills since ""Lazy"" want work. would LOVE get back job. Dollars unit global trade bulk risk money isn’t coming UK. Well, less third one percent rare... muskets instead mass produced semi-auto rifles overweight immune system: ""Train? Naw dog."" Immunotherapy already exists allergies hugely successful. goals 3-4 years use need take shots anymore. ""later date"" mean American company found way get rich selling it? Sure. Time Die? Bond movie perfect title pandemic. championship went 16-1 playoffs year later find makes arms fall off. can't let facts get way children learning facts though. thought reason social distancing stop deaths high-risk people like healthcare workers elderly? they're vaccinated we're good move lives. world

China Eastern get. also case Lance Bottoms running VP. couple weeks ago called Natl Guard reason make look like lost control city. Dihydrogen monoxide put indigo childs body. Viet Cong Taliban used types weapons defeat tanks helicopters drones? matter manufactured it. approved. said available, confusing. Phase III trial different early trial. vaccine candidates made far failed. 3 candidates Phase III right now. vaccines manufactured experimental vaccine mean ever get approval distributed. Ya know community participation something layered nuanced biggest factors work.

Who’s coming knocking doors taking samples? trusted doctor person they’ve never met? 

As community informed given consent program? opinion community leaders board? 

I think it’s scientifically valuable program however need careful implementation.

Btw I’ve noticed thing up/down voting. give opinion usually get better responses experience.

In instance think they’d better letting local clinics collect samples CDC it. want video description it, watch Vaccine episode Coronavirus Explained series Netflix. good job explaining differences, although relatively short segment u/JtheNinja u/Fatwhale good descriptions. entire reason stocks arent looking good AstraZeneca, Oxford, distributors said produced loss.  say LOL. said company based UK probably going trials UK logistically easier.

Why Americans turn everything pissing contest? I'm even British. We're gonna ignore scientists they're forced save us! 


We asteroid 90's disaster movie. 


Unrelated question. name societal bubble made reinforced concrete?


Edit: figured myself: Bunker bubble. I'm knowledgeable enough properly answer part. say farmers doing, causes drastic uptick pricing changes demand dynamics.
Note unique country either. US done, probably still things like this.

The world crisis many facets. employed one. Food prices going insane going fun one. many problems well, list far exhaustive honestly put effort cite sources. exist among many countries world. 

I know easier lazy accept status quo ever slight modifications politicians offer path allowed have. American history says people demand change, change happen. see rather stand way change though. antivaxers anti maskers claim training implanted chip taking away freedom controlling mind... didn’t even click it. 
I wanted see quickly comment would upset people. 
And Record timing.

We need building wood Canada though hope everything gets figured out. Bodes well 2020 then. keto though? There's already riots Trump give fuck sure form working partnership American national health system day now. Agreed. I'm pointing ""being fit"" mean mild symptoms.  Oh absolutely. One already many least consensus seems condemn shame them. You’re uninformed. Phase 3 results final results production distribution ramping vaccine moves phase 3. Lol. bought $1300 off-road electric skateboard finding month beforehand needing new car soon. 

That industry getting hammered right too, went somewhat popular still niche market companies stock weeks/months time. 

Best purchase I've ever made. take daily, ride hours forest paths dogs, local stores. Can't recommend enough, get nice one go 30mph $500. Fingolimod 

Live vaccinations contraindicated, ones less effective. It’s already confirmed vaccination likely dangerous people fingolimod (this vaccines far developed)

The problem case t-cells. works stopping released bloodstream. either vaccine would less effective, would dangerous MS Almost, except nobody really shut degree Europe did. pay rent still don’t want building go “waste” 

No Federal leadership please McConnell help big corporations preventing workers able sue get sick work scroll far see anyone comment dumb title. lol France, face coverings required public enclosed spaces Monday. 

Compared year ago, bitingly ironic. Yup, politically economically sought medical breakthrough world history. need antivax little hesitant this. 

I first line I'm saying (although work probably mandate get sooner rather later). Brain drain make immigration difficult. opposite always true.

Countries implement brain gain strategies attract skilled labor.  I’ll honest, reading title thought going go way. 

Glad someone good news thing!  think there's always room improvement I'm pretty impressed we've responded (in general). worst seemingly beginning old folks homes. many lives lost. 

In ways see Canadians mishandling things? Thats answer want ... stories. Yesterday anIsraeli doctor 2nd infection 3 months first.

I’m frankly terrified Americans coming here. got slice pandemic control, assholes keep getting reinfecting us. Escaping Cat sounds really good moment.

Forcing women work way days weeks giving birth simply barbaric. fair enough mostly facetious  say like it’s joke. fake death numbers spread disease locally ""accident"" bringing covid patients near non-covid patients?

Oh right. staff conscience. may seem like controversial observation, intend offend anyone. However, I'm curious Anti-Maskers demographic largely comprised white young/middle aged women? seem much diversity groups people conform nonsensical, radical ideas. Trump installed crony top USPS, 100% chance mail-in ballots fucked too. would take reduced staffing left-leaning areas; need delay ballots enough can't counted. 

Knowing administration probably get caught, anybody going it? Impeach Trump again?

Everybody get ready vote, early possible. work campus strapped space laughably small proportion courses would able socially distance. Urban campuses often lack space since moved toward denser buildings central areas students congregate. it’s gonna Trump talking experts, gives damn? Georgia’s. Per AJC jobs huh?

You people parroting president sick head. It’s made nonsense random person Reddit made knowledge subject, could get votes. Don’t expect viral infections go away anytime soon. easy move countries.

So, use example: literally suffer explosive episode diarrhea, vomit nonstop, etc? society constructed force believe PUSH it, matter else successful. least change. Yes, people feel sick, sick. Yes, feel sick often others. people raised believe MUST everything meant matter what, we're robots all. unfortunately comes mentality 8 billions people nurtured throughout decades, pandemic much towards changing best. I'm anti-vaxx certainly think Bill Gates devil getting vaccine right away. I'll waiting. already Type 1 diabetes want find severe side effects I've taken it.

One time: Wear mask *assume work.* take additional risks it.

I pro mask. taking dumb risks pandemic. Faroe Islands people slaughter whales dolphins (intelligent beings) hundreds fun. 
I'm sure relaxed attitude towards death. 
I think see pandemic big problem. union I’m pretty sure get fired trying start one. don’t know that’s true it’s threatened so. know companies contracted US. 

Bright meeting told 2 years. !remindme 90 days vast majority us, especially city students. access internet.

I agree everything this. may internet access, nothing access with. Inner city schools city provide iPads kids. everyone computer home means aquire one. Libraries closed, perhaps open student use? Idk. dont disagree you, I'm saying isnt easy ""just online now"".    ...and dad wait 3 days late getting test leave first day thought annoying...couldn't imagine waiting 2 weeks. Go local bar, spend money good time! Yup - parents children. I'll call win. Everyone deal public first line. people actually try keep place clean; important times Doctors Nurses.

This maybe old example Bubonic plague would took hold middle ages people actually cleaning up.

Cleaners money. doubling testing stages Prioritized money likely Librarian here. know name every student school reading habits. classroom teachers spend time do. 

I see every day really high risk interact everyone control digital devices, books media too. mention lunchtime supervision. Yessir Paywall  mandate no? worry, Trump voters generally believe vaccines solving problem antibodies lasting month two? second ? town never even first . places closed like swimming pool I’ve learned that’s can’t rely unreasonable people reasonable things. People like would rather hide likes cowards admit sort mistake try right wrong. democrats Mitch McConnell Obama block appointment Trump RBG pass away see getting infected, wonder works passing along infection. Darn, better hopes face shields,especially struggle breathe mask, plus, see face, too.   We're uncontrolled pandemic. things make buildings handicap accessible, saying Reading order KY Supreme Court, vibe got sensible, orderly way going things, stark contrast injunctions order invalidates. That’s small indication KY SC isn’t going “impetuous” like lower courts maybe. lol Americans really still struggling understand this? also highlights heard immunity works. everyone immunized actually immunity enough people risks associated individual vaccine working someone greatly minimized. Oh gotcha gotcha I’ll take slot 2 Oxford one :) I'm disagreeing there. wanted inject bit common sense since everyone emotional. FDA approval would fast tracked, would still take look it. consider mere formality. want mask work properly. (For masks seal, guess doesn’t make difference it’s scarf bandanna.)

I’ve shaved beard off. none all. Antibodies probably stick around.   However, showing vaccine produces antibodies typical mild case, produces t-cell response, important longer term resistance.  They’ve probably loved entirely ever since campaign ad read book building border wall praising Trump child. Don’t that, don’t give hope. solid selifish ignorant perspective. link? cannot find anything this. definitively know. C19 large RNA virus proofreading mechanism. Large RNA viruses mutate slowly.

Europe:”Nope”  STEM education. Father pathologist. Friends work CDC. tons colleagues working emergency medicine intensive care environments.

You're full shit. Federal government's STEM PEOPLE saying second wave. talk much must suck lack stem eduction, people STEM education saying exactly arguing against, people LACK stem education saying ""well can't listen SCIENTISTS this!"" even trying play at?

give STEM sources comment stop trying pretend science side categorically isn't.

If cases Florida running ICU beds begging FEMA assistance. cut shit. must suck addicted stroking one's ego protecting onesself reality one cannot even listen one's science advisors.  common sense? Honestly ""focus positives"" something agree with, IMHO sticking head sand, treat disease symptoms context means fixing ""doom"" depression comes knowing doom. Also would surprising though lab screw cross contamination false positive result either initially later (most likely would influenza false positive earlier year, followed true positive now).

The problem case studies samples initial infection retained can't retested.

Lab screwups cross contamination outbreak (with lab handling significant numbers actually positive samples) realistically expected least 0.1%. Clinically still excellent specificity. we're 200 million tests administered worldwide, 14 million positives, 100,000 positive tests false, lot people thinking tested positive. people gotten test ILI symptoms rather random screening asymptomatics. 10,000s people walking around influenza told positive test result COVID reasonable. one people get infected actual SARS-CoV-2 gets amplified (much like RT-PCR) one case produces headlines like this.

And far there's evidence people severe unmistakable COVID contracting (I'd even accept loss taste/smell first presentation proof-of-COVID combined test, typical fever + cough + muscle pain).  know they're hard time accepting $400 least, they're god damn minds completely detached reality. $600 incentive based around last resort $15 hour even enough maintain necessities. Let's forget people getting unemployment spend $400-$800 month maintain health insurance lost it, including deductibles potential medication costs. 

This ignoring obvious logic said bonus unemployment feeding economy literally remain running. people money, money goes business, business closes, repeat. lost job month ago, grateful job, tell way horrifying working even bonus, people jobs fail, people jobs fail, fail. bit easier waking morning place go control, imagine waking nothing control. people work jobs available.

Thanks ton! glad one. Wow, can't imagine would this.

He must know something don't!

I think may taken wrong way.

That's okay though.

Everyone knows he's trying.  partner agree severity pandemic threat (I care way feel, feel same)? 

That seems huge source disagreement. Yeah it’s scary optimistic people are. Seeing things like normal people getting Oct/Nov.  Normal folks may see time next year... immune system divided two main parts. innate immune system targets molecular damage associated molecular patterns. Innate immunity provides protection itself, causes inflammation stimulates adaptive immune system. Innate immunity adaptive inherited. 

Adaptive immunity uses hypermutation sort ""monkeys type writer"" way. creates near infinite variations antibodies cell receptors sheer chance match pathogen. pathogen matchen brancv cells b cells stimulated create great number clone fight infections. cells left memory cells making easier body respond next time. cells inherited.

Our immune system rely encountered specific pathogen order mount response I'm saying. me, parents really high risk. unborn child, young toddler, worry much makes crazy. know cry heart relief vaccine found That's good one too! everyone spoke like Britain believable. long known sociopath? make people “feel” better assume stock photo actual scientist working vaccine.  Yeah, I'm sure comment upvoted. suppose people relate tempered optimism vaccines.  Thanks. appreciate response!  Yeah didn’t even know could use emojis reddit post. Hint: Cut bullshit life. likely help. already see quality life suffering certain lifestyles preventable ailments afflict them, often change others' views.

Plus I'm sure many point chance death low most.  even posted? Wtf?  true peoples champion. didn’t protest. I’ve stayed home since March. I’ve worn mask couple times went out. political. spread protest negligible, zero. fact. None said political. already MILLIONS earmarked federal government. asking more, yet nothing working man woman. Trump zero every extra dollar allocate people Heroic Technologist, see you. world owes debt. can't listening him. like mom got elected. Delay December Biden gets elected, pay Facebook millions dollars sell identities anti-maskers ""oops got hacked again"" moment prioritize vaccine everyone else. guess Germany 1937 dumb nation, terrible intelligence? all, one smartest societies planet! technical skills mastery many things extremely high! Holy h*ck, actually true? exist two states: rage suppressed rage. LOL! WW3 distributed first!. world it' collective Governments sucks!. Nothing learned history although 2020! guess Germany 1937 dumb nation, terrible intelligence? all, one smartest societies planet! order see many deaths point would need 150k cases day overwhelm health care system enough. don’t see deaths tripling currently are. get zombies Flu like symptoms sign robust immune response. body spitting tons interleukins get bone marrow ramping up. Places got hit hard much faster droppoff cases places Funny happened day high ranking UAE official visited country. It’s not. people tend turn statement around say deaths aren’t recorded yet takes weeks die haven’t happened. Pretty sure places Yeah grandmaster uses parties, orgies such. Posts respectable news sources reporting Trump says COVID-19 enacts public health policy acceptable; however, ad hominem attacks political party's supporters not. Every place world hard hit able get numbers aggressively without bounce back. 

Places never hit hard, like Israel, cannot keep numbers down. wish could say dog dead miss much. put 3 years old due kidney disease. live alone company. cremation box same. Oh jesus, wait placebos get infected. sad. :( 


I'd rather expose vaccinated people virus (with consent) waiting non vaccinated get exposed... end worse... even morally. Conservative logic: Feelings facts. Natural selection better option, right? Wait..I'm sorry, dont't believe evolution. ""Aye aye, Capt'n!"" 
*Loads Nick Cannon Cannon...* buys time take preventative measures. mean much don't. Aren’t drug makers ramping production vaccines run trials anticipation approved? Kinda like hedging bet? need quiz read news:

Q: wear mask socially distance? 

Q: crippled anxiety right now?

Then based answers get sent good bad news.  Get bunch sailors infected too. okay money gave away propping dinosaur companies though, right? money gave Trump cronies? Hopefully Americans come first working vaccine, honestly think Trump would try monopolise keep world his/America's gain. knows doing. dumb doofus act.

Exactly. internet tendency call people ""stupid"" know exactly greed dehumanization worsening problem.

The denial huge part problem. ""leaders"" *Drunk Power*, work hard wreck goodness. better another fuckin disappointment They're huge sample groups introduce something millions there's always gonna bad reactions. People need expect look broad numbers understand still logical choice get vaccine.

There's overlapping argument prohibition certain drugs, like MDMA, people bad reactions harm making illigal far outweighs harms substance itself. looking wrap nicely election.... 1) Antibody immunity count T-Cell immunity 
2) know percentage people natural T-Cell immunity. 

If 30% already naturally immune, add 20% (Antibody + TCell) that's 50%  ah yes famously known profit company ""oxford university"" looks like link one particular vaccine:     referred to, I'm told, Covid-19 parties they're actually getting together they're trying mingle potentially spread virus amongst they're asymptomatic whatever case might be,” Mr Gibson told local news website Click Orlando.

Seems like ""parties"" people throwing rumors around. 

## Abstract

Global spread severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues unabated. Binding SARS-CoV-2's Spike protein host angiotensin converting enzyme 2 triggers viral entry, proteins may participate, including neuropilin-1 receptor (NRP-1). Spike protein vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) - pro-nociceptive angiogenic factor, bind NRP-1, tested Spike could block VEGF-A/NRP-1 signaling. VEGF-A-triggered sensory neuronal firing blocked Spike protein NRP-1 inhibitor EG00229. Pro-nociceptive behaviors VEGF-A similarly blocked via suppression spontaneous spinal synaptic activity reduction electrogenic currents sensory neurons. Remarkably, preventing VEGF-A/NRP-1 signaling antiallodynic neuropathic pain model. 'silencing' pain via subversion VEGF-A/NRP-1 signaling may underlie increased disease transmission asymptomatic individuals. NYTimes reported Oxford Phase 3 trial starts US August.

If interested signing (registering mean can't turn later). Sign here. NIH central site screening Phase 3 trials vaccines antibodies. Right Moderna screening, change Phase 3 August. Pfizer J&amp;J likely start Phase 3 October November. live US, can't speak guys. wearing mask used associated carrying crimes. That's past thanks There’s need mandated encouraged covid.

Maybe... i'll still use whenever get sick. people adopt mindset (i hope), thing's safer overall. Utah here, mask mandate lovely anti-mask country right am. 

And plans put teachers full classrooms counties. shit show here. Japan sending PlayStations! too! vaccines rest us sooner. Let dumb remain dumb. smarten up, shall stay kid table join adult table. see people refuse social distance wear mask *aren't* threatening peoples' lives. might well waving loaded gun around. hard considerate people. UK Vaccine, aint getting credit shit Gotta back way 2K mark...... Okay I'm anti vaxxer. all. take vaccine rushed process human trials faster history? Please please please counterpoint Best quote I've heard thus far Brian Kemp (Georgia Governor) banning mask mandates:

""When policies regressive make Alabama look progressive, got problem."" Guillain-Barré Syndrome - read, natural influenza also risk factor. guess assumed risk upcoming vaccine, seems flu vaccines. hear challenging speak sedated intubated. worry production vials syringes covid flu season. hope securing increased production things right now.  ordered production back May. can't find anyone Bright saying ""2 years"", companies saying months.

We 300 million people US -- giving two doses result 840 million uses? added extra flu shots others. assumed every single person US going get two doses exactly time addition extra 160 million flu vaccines, also given exact time. worst case, fine plan fall short, useful predicting actual needs.

By way, figure included needles used hospitals, ones used vets, doctor's offices, diabetics, etc. supply US likely 50% double more, meaning even much smaller ramp up.

Again, mildly ramp production modestly, we've done giving companies contracts back May, we're probably good. Even then, probably prioritize / change scopes procedures reduce needle usage 6% need make enough available vaccine. Instead using 4 needles family's yearly flu vaccine, could get inhaled one, share needles across us -- risks miniscule needle sharing among trusted family members. reduced families use needles year 50%, reduced families need needles coronavirus vaccine 75% percent.

In short -- something mildly concerned about, definitely show normal year, U.S. hospitals go 4.5 billion disposable, plastic syringes. doesn’t include syringes pharmacies doctors’ offices use flu shots. also doesn’t include retail market diabetics flush injectors hospitals use IV fluids.

“If nation pivot utilize those, could,” Powell said.

If market required go making 500 million syringes year making additional 850 million, would problem, said. since U.S. produces billions, it’s much stretch. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Here’s thing, way Anti-Vaxxer me, would wait months would get it. passes clinical trials, doesn’t necessarily mean side effects pop people around world got, can’t test everyone. me, least 3 months would get Garcetti coward hides behind Newsom. irresponsible rushing reopen. make worse. dear leader want makeup rub mask  Best option would older kids stay home younger kids go take extra space created older kids gone Great, flesh eating zombies christmas! Come weld doors friend Florida right family member dying. colon cancer. complained weren’t getting many cancer treatments Covid “hoax”. Well Covid pneumonia infection. would probably made weren’t Covid. might also passed Covid spouse children.

Doctors trying balance risks. can’t pass cancer others. need control pandemic instead blaming doctors make tough calls. would reallocate funds medical organizations *GLOBAL* pandemic? That’s complete opposite doing. need customs inspection? Track Jack em.  2003 specific family virus yeah  concern point anti vaxers. They're going go it, that, know ton parents anti-vax, said give kid COVID vaccine. I'm going lie, reservations given quickly produced without usual testing time. mean get kids, understand concern. right thing help people. said, it’s pretty shitty many hospitals laid staff, and/or cut wages. lot hospitals hardly pay, don’t pay taxes either. 

Instead paying better wages attract staff, relying government. 

Now government paying means paying it. Privatize gains, socialize losses. Manufacturing done. procurement medical company. guarantee keep syringes raw materails including plastics packaging. maybe expensive usual suppliers already adopted increased production. never will. Normal gone now, highly doubt things ever go back pre covid. that's also bad thing. way covid jumped us head socially years. major steps telecom hygene realize cat already bag? gonna trial us 😬 That’s works need COVID first. (Don’t worry rate people like sadly probably will). die COVID organ failure bc lungs filled fluid organs don’t get enough oxygen hence heart attack die COVID complications still there’s ignorant dumbasses like impacted propaganda say doctors nurses front lines lying it’s hoax. Fuck piece shit churches service outdoors. don’t know church really want defy orders stay indoors It’s 25% capacity choice imo. one going don’t feel safe....whether that’s traveling get around work work. make vaccine fast understand crack teams working September seems way 2 soon. Whole lot essential functions keep many safely employed, yeah, obviously drop retail/hospitality/entertainment everyone’s gotta eat, use electricity, take dumps, burn gas. **join** unions. Time send Mercy ship new port. like state fyi. There's probably dozen. yeah punishment covid. whatever else big man planned. Yeah, even brief bit reading company see good Moderna technology platform insert synthetic mRNA living cells would reprogram cells develop immune responses, rather created externally injected conventional medicines. novel technique abandoned several large pharmaceutical biotechnology companies unable overcome side effects inserting RNA cells.[6][7][8] May 2020, mRNA drug approved human .2% almost 25% less .26% bottom end CDC range cited. absolutely cannot say .2%.

People would leave man alone. Autograph autograph gracious whole time ffs let man watch son peace. Amazing. I've talking girl really want take date, visit high risk elderly aunt way often take chances.

We've lost bunch points speaking French (understandable Quebec), wanting kids, wife older 40, wife much work experience. Even though wife Masters PhD, BS, points since I'm younger work experience.

The points system seems skewed young people wanting families, older DINK couples. Or, know, could mean masks making difference state since city/county mandates implemented. live fully aware mask wearing increased greatly past weeks. could well result that.

Anyway, understand US different political sphere, huge amount land cultural differences people. case around it’s also factor keep mind. parties mask major ones (CDU, SPD) accept it. also don’t idiot president, helps lot. chanceler scientist I’ve noticed that, part, government took scientific approach. 

The mask still political subject around though we’ve fair share demonstrations it’s “robbing people freedom”, many see mask violation constitutional rights. 

I understand meaning believe may bit misunderstanding. US interesting country comes demographics politics, different Europe good also bad. don’t revere people gods? Let’s simply appreciate contributions hard-working people social monetary compensation. understanding would “out,” probably accessible general public 2021, right?

The really good news there's promising vaccines coming western Chinese companies I'm pretty sure everyone able it. Well goes another dream... fml... thanks 😊 Except Sweden stayed almost entirely open whole time without even mask mandate still numbers going quite lot. people anti lockdown protests months earlier despite fact vancouver never actually lockdown (as evidenced fact allowed protesting).

The vaccine needs prioritized based usefulness think sunbathing help people fight Coronavirus? US? Lol Read article least.

Still, May 7 earnings call, the CEO manufacturer Becton, Dickinson Co. said manufacturers could make many – even billion – syringes, moment’s notice.

“People proactive beginning order stockpile devices now,” CEO, Thomas Polen, said. “It cannot ‘wait last minute’ expect products able manufactured.”

The U.S. Department Health Human Services contracted four companies produce least 820 million syringes – which includes 420 million end year rest next year. mental health definitely worse year. things experienced forever impact life. never thought would experience repetitive trauma nurse practitioner. constantly edge, vivid nightmares reliving experiences, reliving deaths patients, questioning every thought action. 

I feel would beneficial go talk therapist, want exposed people need to. want family get sick, toddler, parents grandparents... anxiety bad right now, seems like people get US. 

It's beyond frustrating. individuals went experiences past months would feel completely different. 

I honestly want okay, I'm not. getting worse. getting worse one cares. Based recent history bet anti vax become new anti mask tends true big hospitals rural smaller ones. 

Does someone remember article talked this? Think read today. I'm Florida.

If weird cold back late March made cough week half, fever, headaches night sweats coronavirus want find is. “We wont comply. Corona lie! Give us freedumb we’de rather die!” damn monsta!! in!

Oh, live society people value common good Gotcha, looks like didn’t look far enough. Thanks! Oh man. Well, may odds ever favor. mean read? one comprehend comment? hope gets sniffles. worry. nothing! Read it. Thanks thoughtful response, mostly curious. Emotional fallacies. scared wear mask stay inside, force others to. Yeah, kind favorite thing that. think there's possibility microchip within vaccine could much privacy damage carrying around phone using platforms like Facebook hospitals collapse That's thought. Hold church outside.  Every church I've seen plenty folding chairs. IMO empathy gap really core problem US, given culture especially certain subcultures foster lack empathy. Canadian well! Single day record need averages meaningful. quarantine though. community transmission happening here! Life back normal while. Muh collection plate. Sorry Canada, sane Americans believe science held hostage trump crazed followers. terrifying. scared election hijacked. Keep rushed market, barely tested vaccine.

I've gotta research time biology seems eternally trapped 12 years old. might mad I've ever seen anyone anything! keep going bit record science posterity? Agreed global scale. seems hard hit corrupt areas. think we’re lied to. don’t like idea taking vaccine unproven, giving 9 month old something statistically I’m going fine get it. want freedom choice looks like gone.  No, informative. I'm guessing IndiaTimes article (which understand blah source) little aggressive Oxford saying September/October quite time IIRC. way look it, they're dosing people, they've deemed safe vaccines generally take years proven safe effective. sure time given permission fast track candidates. Many also vaccine keep eyes on. 

Let's keep fingers crossed hope best!! I'm sure want thing end. Yikes, that’s creepy. moronic reactions get political structure turns every single issue culture war. Coincidentally that's Covid19's favorite/theme song...  Well, stage 3 trials go according plan release public, ill midnight release like 2001 again. Even means could result immense losses within many families? morons feel rights violated 20 minutes it'll take get groceries. many lives lost due ignorance. Personally, would much rather forced wear mask weeks virus die instead feeling special one, potentially spreading family causing losses, part cause overwhelming number cases. opinion old sport. Altenatively, could take Karens. sailors infected yet? Hopefully vaccine rolled November, things start going back normal January. hope. Maybe restart schools winter break finally start getting control. kinda makes sad advanced biotechnological age still depend 30+ innocent people getting sick possibly dying make sure vaccine safe. know we'll never know 30+ people sacrificing greater good humanity makes something even word ""hero"" describe.

Would love send someone know. Yeah, situation, wouldnt great even burlington I'm worried about. flu vaccine often like 50% effective. Obviously still improvement think important people realize case one too, everyone thinks they're 100% immune go ahead ditch masks hang small rooms groups people :\ Brits *once again* Lockdowns spreqd illness... actually new argument I've never heard... Yup. even done one 2 weeks April catch cases got family-to-familial transmission first lock down. could handled contact tracing It’s didn’t strong evidence it, conjecture still conjecture even ends right. know isn’t science sub conjecture based anecdotal evidence fly here, there’s big difference saying it’s possible investigated cautious meantime straight saying it’s thing heard story missing 90% details seems imply it’s happening.

Even actual better studies coming in, keeps coming it’s rare, requires specific conditions become bigger danger, general route infection causing infections, seems possible. Right inspire open window leave door open confined space, maybe lose ton sleep airborne transmission since it’s part this, major route transmission think infection kids stays kids magically? 

Actually? kinda does. know sounds counter-intuitive, true. bunch international sources say children largely spread virus, amongst themselves, children adult.

But worried long term negative affects vaccine may worries new rushed vaccine. us growth construction. Commercial construction livelihood living area without growth would big step pay. Union construction might add. work without union. situation might different moste Okay? common sense right? People spread virus way older people do...who would've guessed Yes. it’s done everywhere. Neither positive negative numbers actually “people”. “tests”. 

This goes number see United States likely countries, though don’t know sure second one. certainly list numbers way, probably. good news, think really need keep pressure prevention.To summarize concerns, 
EDIT: remotely anti-vax person. Dude, there's impediment produce more, plastic. actually believe there's way ramp production? taking way context Bright said. Bright said precisely make people know needed ramp production. say ""we able make syringes"", said current levels Production enough, would take year make necessary amount, need increase production. Unfortunately, work. refer ""winning,"" yes, tired winning.

We need comprehensive nation-level plan, going get it. failure leadership rivals Hoover terrible economic collapse  give Americans much credit, they'll easily vote Governor again. actually, pretty angry posts also, appear moderated, even bad language posts there, could weekend, know Google Italy excess deaths. They're dying something. United States same. Basically every country ""unexplained"" excess deaths. Honestly, lot people still travelling acting like nothing happening. easy ignore continue acting like idiot head sand really want to. (Until get sick course...) That’s good point, yes would absolutely factor. means explains relative difference Italy California absolutely would PART equation. Even without still would highly politicized long Trump sticks position odds medical reality. cases clearly gone places large protests places major spikes cases particularly large protests (LA probably main exception there).

I think anger really stems certain people would much rather blame BLM protesters admit wrong reopening. comment removed auto mod gave good-faith answer, probably check history nah, i'll explain someone like difficulty connecting dots onslaught covid patients coming waves, big waves, healthcare professionals much limited resources. 

I think fact system coping effectively means ""onslaught"" big? Nah, wants privatized. Yes, well, things social solidarity set good example others. course, washing one's hands frequently good behavior corona not. worry, children's health gambled guy bankrupted multiple casinos house. No, accident. Effective psychopath. Dig trench, bar needs lowering. That’s works time. don’t know health effects couple months, much it. Vaccines don’t get made quickly. shouldn’t made years well   RIP sir.

I fear older family members. So, ass? No. still people think it’s hoax together. makes difference people. people know it’s real, don’t care still assume claims likely made back virus barely known all. Specifically thinking won’t affected  incorrect. study found children 10 transmit covid19 frequently. finding corroborated many studies. one knows yet. 

You're proving point re: importance science cut personal bullshit. one would blame believing young children transmit covid19 comparable adults that's experiences influenza suggest. science says wrong. Woohoooo!!!! actually working rather well, cases deaths downward slope places declared victory prematurely reopened way fast completely erasing progress they’d made point. Probably using comfort again, time Texas opposed Manhattan. I’m really hoping collective populace fucking something it, I’m worried it’s bystander effect action.

Agreed. terrible much Normalized. We've proven arrogant ignorant people. refuse social distance refuse wear masks. blame them. It’s enforced Walmart! whole country NEEDS another stay-at-home order point! park cart diagonally across aisle. Turn around bucko going wrong way. Dammit. goes Florida escape plan. People don’t realize long takes make mass production. How? there's zero risk anything life. could catch Hepatitis someone poorly washed utensils restaurant hundreds situations like this, entire life.

There 3,365 confirmed cases hepatitis 2017. Using risk contracting hepatitis play risk contracting pandemic virus currently infecting 70,000+ people day quite frankly irresponsible. Exactly. Covid truly IQ test. 😣 awful Bottoms actually trying. southern governors ruining efforts many large cities right now. sucks. 

Soon shit said done I'm getting FUCKING obliterated montego bay fam, let's get turnt. I'll pour one beach American brethren tho

Edit: yeah Jamaica carribean idgaf I'm wasted Exactly. spend 15+ years using technology SARS 1 modified slightly since similar SARS 2 ^Has kind Dylan-esque feel Hiw phase 3 trials fast? strike enough time know works safw. best hope Oxford Vaccine legit america going hit half million deaths. Yeah well we’d followed obvious, pre-existing epidemiologist-designed plan massively available testing tracing get go instead pretending big joke might’ve got wish could still mostly open economy right well schools etc. 
btw come it’s always socialism needy faultless masses bothers types massive endless socialism greedy un-needy rich? Asking friend would vaccinating healthcare workers help stop spread deaths? large % infections attributed healthcare workers? thing since Castro croaked. jump bandwagon give award feel like it’s gonna let down, I’ll reserve till September RemindMe! comment contains domain hardbanned reddit cannot approved, usually due major violations [site-wide rules](/rules).

Not saying OP accurate neither timeline lmao, no.

[Polio vaccines small chance causing vaccine's history risk low enough justify, though. defense, AstraZeneca distributor maybe they'll get boost? Oh, wonder he’s going vote November?

&lt;loud, angry Trumpet music people die, better job he’ll think Trump doing. *you* die....  man, he’ll probably sell old stuff donate Trump re-election campaign. Sign trials Well, might get herd immunity reckless people? Never heard term before, mean....""bystander effect""?

Like said previous comment, never Trump. walk away shut hear saying countless time he's greatest world. People everywhere dying, still seem register everything him. Sorry. Honestly, cares rest us get it? really become natural selection. Private business making rules government fails so- yet people trumpet free market capitalism scream rights abridged store tells leave following rules. Testing reporting deaths straight forward process -- lots steps data passes numerous agencies departments. 

For reporting deaths example, CDC says:

""Death certificates take time completed. There many steps filling submitting death certificate. Waiting test results create additional delays.

States report different rates. Currently, 63% U.S. deaths reported within 10 days date death, significant variation states.

It takes extra time code COVID-19 deaths. While 80% deaths electronically processed coded NCHS within minutes, deaths COVID-19 must coded person, takes average 7 days.""


As indicated, process certifying deaths pass numerous agencies, departments etc. places, imagine, closed weekend since government jobs. states, however, may continue work weekend.

So, official death count see today may actually occured week ago, cases, several weeks ago (or even month ago!). people screaming ""but deaths gone up!!! won!"" wrong. There's lag time diagnosis death, there's lag time actual death official reporting death. fact antibodies lasts weeks months, make sense build huge stockpile (hundreds millions doses) vaccinate many people short period time? Otherwise, time normies able get vaccinations, first group received months prior might susceptible again. anybody know, perhaps real answer, long 'being track' would take average citizen able get access it, way get flu shot right now.

And global scale. 

Does vaccine actually chance eliminate disease send us back 'normal life' time next year? i.e. sporting event 20K people stands worry. Nice! One general question here, ICU bed means ICU beds beds reserved covid19. someone get car accident around one hospitals. get bed look else where. Exactly - weekend numbers. fantasy footballers it’s like players don’t practice wed Thursday.
It’s weekend dudes. Monday numbers actually matters. Good point lol, sometimes need think little longer speak XD Great blow movement? You’re making awfully big assumptions intelligence ability think critically. Obviously there's natural political element specifics became politicised feels like straight Idiocracy sequel 911 dispatcher hell Florida here. 

I don’t want award. don’t want thank you. 

You fuckers, know are, plague rats wearing masks, making cringiest memes, politicizing pshaw-ing simple procedures like wearing masks social distancing, simple message:

Shut up. seriously shut fuck up. 

I’m sick stamping people dead “it’s flu bro”. 

I’m sick “I don’t believe numbers it’s skewed, it’s bad.” 

Fucking spoiler fucking bad. numbers LOW BALLED can’t get information due unable perform tests also doctor club changing causes death either pre-existing conditions pneumonia...

Leading another point: fuck health care “professionals” willfully changing data, you’re bad fucking virus putting GUYS risk don’t tell us fucking truth. 

Lastly, I’m tired debatable fucking issue. any...ANY one agency reads this, know talks “personal liberties”, “we don’t want get panic”, “it’s flu”, favorite “it’s killing people would die anyway”, hope...god HOPE public safety fun, going sing like fucking BIRD reviews come up.

C'mon man. read this? They're starting scratch vaccine. That's think might quickly. *melanin Looks like might available September. Umm read title?

Profits people. country (The Netherlands) mandatory wear mask, public transport. reason behind is, government said masks low effect prevention spreading virus. 

Therefore, wear mask (except public transport.) also low number Covid-19 patients Netherlands right numbers going up.

I wear mask to, wrong?  become case news reporters running steam, seeing Sweden's continuously improving. Well, compared previous sundays shows new high Unlike United States, countries capable leadership acknowledge serious pandemic actually *want* stop OK - well work University we're destroyed COVID. due remote teaching number students deferring year huge. get lot income student accommodation, especially students first year. get lot income foreign students. Thats lot lost optimistic work. think firm behind producing 6 billion doses ? manufactured licence every country around world diagrams windshield wiper replacement never right swear it’s purpose.  us still personal lockdown infuriated. feels like whole nation screw ones trying hard right thing. evidence yet long lasts? know things like seasonal flu, vaccine needs updated every year, I've seen articles people getting reinfected Covid already. I'm happy take vaccine often need, I'm curious. norway good bad suing atlanta made president look bad insisting wear mask. Yep. Tons responses like Twitter. ever thought maybe sort action cause people get tested all

Same red flag laws Massachusetts doctor remove second amendment rights letter judge secret. actually relevant. makes virus spread way differently places Sweden? depends actions country takes regarding variables cause virus spread first reducing Sweden's curve ""Just data trends downwards presently"" dishonest best. weeks MONTHS without change policy. 

lol I'm actually honest said anything weeks? countries cited data trending downwards months countries refused wear masks results seeing inevitable..

In fact Sweden still reporting cases Australia daily avg even Australia experiencing 2nd wave infections pretty much sums point haha Yep. I'm Vermont would work September, October, May, June. understanding, expedited nature production logistics. Typically, would wait one phase even make product next phase. vaccines, monitory support stockpile produce ahead time go straight next phase less downtime. Thanks. never unemployment, wonder quitting circumstances would considered acceptable. 

Without health insurance could paid treatment (well... even insurance.)

With luck able perform job somewhere takes safety seriously. Nah, cat pics still reign Supreme. shall never defeated. USA save world again!! WOOOOO!!!!!! (UK) said won’t produce US case Tango export bans like Remdesovir. Reap sow Provoking cell response bodes well long term immunity cells often ""remember"" infections long time. obviously question report deaths multiple causes. 

If guy dies stroke, that's counted death due heart disease. gets fever common cold dies stroke, that's still death due heart disease. gets fever COVID-19 dies stroke, he's likely counted coronavirus case. So, deaths hospitalizations? numbers faked Japan too? Virus⬇️ Norwegian prime minister thing... people inverted commas? suggesting site full UK bots? Even masks made mandatory everywhere US, society folks individually decide rule apply them, may well suggestion best. honestly feel like someday going looked back upon similar way Japanese internment camps, trail tears etc. fucking disgrace. EXCELLENT! Nice know we're much page ready. :) may work company lol.

literally every way bean counters measure business better end Q1 year (April,May,June) vs end Q1 last year. also better Q4 last year. making money, expenses down, etc etc. send monthly surveys well people responded much happier year work life balance time last year.

All said, higher ups still keep talking need get back office. Yeah like ""another metaphor"". mandatory Quebec. Why? told everyone masks social distancing cut spread disease. worked, people got lazy selfish. instead asked, told. draconian regulation, government trying save dumbass citizens. impression SARS vaccine never developed caused ADE animals. need encourage sensible people leave Florida immediately, including healthcare workers, making plans gone least month. that, let ones remain 'live up' speak, encourage mingle carry Democrat Virus created Bill Gates.

Your neighbours going kill fucking mother, alternatively, they're going pick up, spread around more, die themselves. both. 

Everyone blaming Floridians, people realise lot problem people still fucking arriving state come down. yes, empathy care happens people. attitude exactly america laughing stock world right now.

High infection count, high deaths, inability control spread anti-science attitude underpins all. Fucking embarrassing vaccine normal spike protein vaccine. long producing anti-bodies would safe use different vaccines use today (unlike mRNA ones). require long safety test period.

There still questions answer, like long anti-bodies stay system even work actual virus.

They targeting September release. live Republic. president leaving local governments decide. people keeping bringing ""death Covid vs death Covid"". Yep. company wear mask get desk moving sitting desk people (and do) take masks. 3 different people within ~6ft me. Even though live somewhere we’re temperature mellow (highs 70s lower 80s) never open windows. sanitize area pretty much whole office twice day. would feel safer sanitation people wearing masks windows open. It’s security theater sucks. Feels like someone comes positive we’re likely get it.  Joke's im already furry inject full shit pls Get money life insurances?  think that?

I really understand it. surgical mask rock bottom minimum. wide variety though - find one actually get good seals around nose.

My biggest overall concern surgical mask, KN95, n95, etc really counterfeits. way truly judge efficacy unless sourced reputable supplier (note Amazon reputable supplier). It’s bizarre all. ignoring us kept warning dangerous anti-intellectual fascist sentiment country. Since one assume don’t covid, one reasonably assume meant essential services necessary population sustain itself. healthcare would small piece pie. 

That’s really, really basic logic. Inept leadership, selfish citizens protesting every day, refusing wear mask, etc. People rant kinds stuff location every they're religious fanatics. Every awhile, someone intelligent get soap box.  Critical thinking talking shit. opinion without judged. Well maybe often reddit. stimulus done little help economy.

I think meant to.  think mostly meant buy time. pandemic came suddenly enough private equity firms leveraged hilt, investment firms capital risky places, billionaire investors caught flat footed.  

The ""stimulus"" meant buy enough time exit market, clean positions prep take advantage coming crash, they'll able buy everything gets liquidated/sold/devalued pennies dollar.

The red zone cases consists states 100 new cases per 100,000 people last week, red zone test positivity states positivity rate 10% raise you, Gov DeSantis course not, fiance American I've good fortune knowing lot decent people U.S., lot horrible ones too.

Every damn country figured we’re saying “we gotta keep economy going, people die time” guy quoted OP's article chair ethics committee. He's directly involved idea long going take. remember Steffi Graf asking fan question. yea cause world would never happen here. bad done countries already. mean politicians put money life first anyways. powerful vested interests prominent positions loudly speaking masks. like elite voices speak one voice mass uprising them. ""burden proof"" little back forth, would. isn't, so, I'm obligation link anything. referring politicians rights private citizens, they've never official position, private citizens.

Register DNR don’t save ass. includes reside with. Michigan told hear back test negative. try calling results, did.  $4 per $150 get tested ..... Shit make sense perfect analogy He's smart.

He's pretending Trump's buffoonery coherent. People die. topic interest couple weeks ago r/walmart going beyond bad we're planning saving sick time calling in... dangerous actually go work Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday week matter time shit hits fan. people literally killing themselves. yell sleepwalker; may fall break neck. Numbers still climbing Houston throughout Texas.

This real concern, already seeing play elsewhere state:  People really believe China going full capitalism go back communism/socialism later ? twisted mind fit narrative.  I'll take hits - agree, think right. mean, adults urinating floors public stores indicative simple everyday stupidity, I've gotta kind absolute genius....and I'm :) states ordered hospitals report data anyone state health department.

I think means John Hopkins data come state level unless lawsuits win out. work changed rules allow us come waiting results. again, first day self-isolated, use sick/vacation days.

Current rules still someone covid, enough sick/vacation days leave without pay. said paying us would financially harm company exempt law requiring paid leave provided.

The take away got happened was, ""being responsible means getting paid."" So, (the employees) best interest get tested. Healthcare workers, older people, nursing homes, nursing home staff come first. that's top previous arrangements well. key reason right join EU vaccine scheme.

Edit, would appear people would rather us joined scheme scrapped deals. requirement, deals must negotiated block. India 3rd world testing worst pollution sanitation people.  probably js astronomically higher whatever report.  They're following regular vaccine standards giving kids? thought one 18 would getting quite while?

Usually test kids giving them! far they've done 0 trials children.   joking obviously. Yes, many states ""lock down."" compliance state low (Maryland, DC suburbs - densely populated). Barely states properly enforced ""lockdowns."" Lol know pay stuff taxes Europe (I'm France), get right: Americans actually also pay bucket load taxes.

The Federal taxes 10% 37%, depending income bracket. 
You pay Local Taxes (State + Local unlucky) ranging 0% 13.3%.

State taxes considered deductible expense Federal taxes.

The US also happens tax non-resident citizens exactly way residents :) yeah, employed Sweden, earn bucket-load taxed enough, taxes... 

You could argue income tax, paying Social Security taxes (quite high France, costing lot money, again, mum getting free cancer treatment I'm imagining I've paid taxes :) )

Well guess what: US payroll taxes Federal State level, owed employer employees. mean? Social Security Medicare Taxes imposed employers employees combined rate 15.something%. gets weird: Social Security tax first 132.9k USD salary, Medicare tax 0.9% anything 200k USD.

So, I'd argue Americans pay less much taxes higher European countries France Spain (maybe Belgium, Belgium takes half everything earn 30k EUR, ridiculous!). Furthermore, benefit amazing infrastructure, free healthcare, life-saving drugs next nothing, police force shoot sight feel like it.

Sorry long post, imaginary potato: examples [petitions caused [a relevant cause petition, BLM protests sparked first [sweeping police reform bill fight accept way things are. accept supression manipulation take place . Bit bit, signature signature, call call congressmen/women, fight change I'd like see. that's about: starting ground up. influence change happen even little bit, better done nothing all. let defeatist ideology get way that. vax, job.

No vax, school.  want people get sick die, I'm also lose everything close again.

The middle ground everybody wears masks.

But Florida, so...I guess they've picked dying ex-wife agreed we’ve switched daughter’s enrollment online platform county luckily offers middle high school aged students. she’s going 6th grade next year thankfully learning home, program excels format. we’re willing send daughter die, possibly contract spread disease rest family. Let’s imagine there’s long term immunity virus. reinfection happens ~3 months. would mean ~9 years we’d 50% population. talks another version Coronavirus spread? stronger deadlier version that’s similar Covid-19? mom keeps talking two strains. Trying put rest. many people is, even USA. look footage large gatherings similar stuff, sure find example area too. course, restrictions. enforced? 3 weeks later, gotten surge beds yet, curve plateaued looks like may starting trend Fuck that. morons made decision, die it. would therefore surprised index cases found 10-19 age group predominantly late teens already involved cult

I think not. 

Children 14-19 SK live remarkably controlled life, often degree human rights violated (they surely violated heavily 10 yrs ago, stronger restrictions came place), go university. Basically, sort smooth transition life styles 18 19. Everything life changes age 19. Late teens, 16-18 yrs old, least socially active group SK, go school academy without much exception. paper linked article refer group ""school-aged children"" instead specifying age. side note, 19 yr old folks indeed university freshmen, year, chance experiencing kind change life. Thus, think biased much towards certain age.

On hand, Shincheonji cult mostly composed 20-30 yrs old people. infamous exploiting younger folks, cannot teenagers, teenagers get involved deep sort cult activity, parents would immediately notice score cards. University students desirable activity since often live away parents, get monitored much, much free time compared teenagers. 

In conclusion, highly unlikely ""teen"" group biased towards late teens, since would little ""cult-involved"" late teens. someone Europe. complete disbelief badly Florida whole US handling this. I'm truly sorry stuck politics.

edit: words can't even rub two brain cells together seconds realize logic falls apart like 3 seconds:

If government businesses can't mandate mask, clearly can't mandate kind clothing. guess OK wear crotchless vinyl pants front 8 year old daughter, right? clothing somehow OK regulate masks aren't? I'd also like show constitution talks this.

I really feel lady. I've pretty lucky I've able work home several months company coworkers take seriously. people beyond redeemable point. going learn, hard way, unfortunately. try keep safe meantime.

I remember predicting 500k dead like 1-2 months ago everyone knew thought crazy incredibly pessimistic. quickly looking like lower bound. There's vast difference risking life save person risking life save vacation plans. Came say this. US one financial contributors vaccine, contracted 300m first billion doses. replace ""mask"" ""helmet"" comes motorcycling. *“Look we’ve come (expletive) helmet”* sounds irresponsible silly it?

In fact, wearing mask even meaningful helps reduce spread (i.e. affects everyone else less). closed opened everyone still wears masks distances. Please eat Mac Donalds anti vaxxers Thanks podcast link! Based numbers, 145k dead approximates 5% ($1 trillion) America's GDP lost since February. That's absolutely staggering doubt massive effects economy generation.

An interesting tidbit podcast transcript part Bush administration 2003 tried put seniors discount value life people lost collective shit notion. Whereas we're currently experiencing exact opposite response face actual seniors dying thousands. Well, fact implying skepticism economic crash shows delusional least sense.

Based research I've done, going hit millions deaths. remember first time said thing would take millions. long realized going happen. 

I know thing scary. unknown. give us excuse leave millions dust. made sense overreact March. know thing nearly bad thought would be. Calling destruction economy absolutely morally superior choice. without financial assistance. diminish it? looks lot like Georgia going Florida first week July end next week, followed within week two Tennessee, South Carolina Alabama. Maybe North Carolina too. Within month seems likely Southeast spiking.  still fail understand covid.  I'm getting confused. exactly mean? mean John Hopkins data hate sound totally cold, possibly much ($8 mil) really old person? say someone cares elderly mother. generating much economy point elder care, medical care, weekly supplies. Oh, Xfinity 24/7. 

Anyone Medicaid taking they're putting in. 😊  Okay get beta? dont think many? werent lot pictures them. would thought would footage place, saw pics end March, none .. friend, alone. ♥ Inflation would greatly accelerated based what? make statement.

You implying nearly half world infected. basic math says 600k already died, death rate, total world death count 1.3 million would imply nearly half world infected.

I’m going argue deadly think virus is. facts least 600k died. means believe half world virus. don’t shred proof make claim, willing put idiotic opinion there. That’s amazes me. image stll working place dont pay you. imagine money illusion keep people control. speak another country maybe learn country instead listening brainwashed media. cause guess china did, locked yea. also freeze economy, gave everyone equally amount food FREE, ONE PAY RENT DUE VIRUS. let sink in. saying system good damn look people got THIS. say country. that. keep delusion. Republican says &lt;pulls don’t care affects me! real. can't work home 4 hours tired around wife? sounds like insufferable one Symptoms could rona. Fatigue, headache on. think cold.

Thanks man. Good luck! how? novel. can’t work vaccine disease exists... Fuck I'm 2020 AD America can't get tested. bothered get good grades he’s going get anyway? would waste time. time better honing bullshit skills becoming friends right people attending right social events participating right activities. honestly think basic algebra test intelligence means anything? get anyone anywhere? delusional. love people think future this. like get mad mask fine overlook peeing floor, risk willing take. can't look one week celebrate deaths like that.

I'm sure world live where~90 people died yesterday/ ~750 avoidable deaths happened last week like ""that's low number. I'm totally ok happening every day""

Not mention number percentage going go due death time lag, even didn't. Even Florida stayed 100 extra deaths day/ ~750 week can't imagine saying ""this low number celebrate it!""

And believe deaths increasing look rate deaths last week week, happen again. takes time die this. happen immediately. person seem privileged enough Karen. matter, would punishing directly wearing masks like they're supposed to. least submit ID hospitals insurance providers denied coverage care Covid related issues. I'm serious, ridiculous take individual liberties gone way far we're going suffer indignant childishness. let live rest lives without additional consequences beyond we'll facing stupidity thickheadedness.  would like know many people getting effects virus. Heart damage, brain damage, lung damage. I'd tell get hotel. fact that's told partner changed behavior quickly. Granted anti-masker. Here's one SC ruling: photo protest yesterday: (conspiracists)

Here's recent story beaches recent cases report: also contains grand totals

Here's nice dashboard: course Thank this. Gee, shit... Why'd take long come conclusion? Oh, right... Florida. Florida needs locked 5 years educated till longer stupid haha ;) think JJ Abrams jizzed comment. think district shaped like C bad? Try one that's shaped like C fucking [400 mile long  [Like think overseas manufacturing location means it'll distributed outside US necessarily... RT-PCR instrument takes 3 hours. PCR tests every day, Covid. typically takes 18 cycles, least, order get amount DNA amplification required visible reading. That's instrument I've ever used last 10 years. American political system built loopholes Well would communism, right? least socialism. Probably. Maybe even nazi communism (shout gets it)! Honestly, underst--yeah, understand. hope people able realize contributed horrible time America one day. I'm joking too... $500 actually seems low real price uninsured peasants People getting sick Covid could prevented? happening obviously depends environment work in. fired sick days people supposed stay home. think employers make step right direction first. Luckily case work. Dude. Silver dollar city. way rub in. Wishing best ❤ wrong people? europe. Mother spent 1w ICU 3w hospital 1,5y ago. Surgery+ICU+meds+room=some 500USD equivalent € total. Reporting Finland.

P.S. everything else expensive U.S. low wages cheap buildings (land super expensive Helsinki area standards building houses seems way U.S. average probably rough winter). pay way taxes this.

Examples:

- pay 30% income tax (progressive, capped @ 60%). top company pays 60% salary form different payments

- Car tax like 50% price car expensive ones

- gas 5,7 USD per gallon huge tax

- Capital income tax 30%

- Vat 24% /r/covid19positive Define ""soon enough"".... 19 days later we're still managing. says anyone disagrees fake news. he's always right, he's someone else lying. must right too! Lmao America tanks plague still need doctors around bed occupied patients. justice, Trump would last get it. idiot went “COVID party”, refused wear mask, wore mask mouth nose / repeatedly called COVID hoax. Oh wow, know that.

For stupid reason thought like instantaneous hotline something every hospital reports daily. makes sense.

the tracking sites update daily makes sense lag.

Welp, go theories ""the death rate look bad."" confused sure. skin back stays home? Looks like doesn’t opinion either. perfect plan sociopath. Burn* Ecuador too... government complete piece sht incentivizing tourism Quito (the capital) ICU beds Guayaquil managed control virus last month (keep mind two main cities country). Plus I’m pretty sure international travelers required quarantine.
Such bs Pandemrix linked causing increase narcolepsy years ago. Trying stare unibrow. Depending amount money family would better winning lottery. Society whole? No. Multiple studies, guy. Here's two top realize Oxford UK right? mean US given money rights research. honestly makes hopeful since would probably screw up. said expect vaccine give immunity year. Booster shots don’t really work well type vaccine. point, would rational assume counts cases deaths massively counted. Especially states electorally important swing states. Texas right tip spear that. really hope they’re extremely corrupt shit terms covering numbers, there’s whistleblower kind person come Jesus moment, reveals what’s happening district month.  Yeah, report March 6, may well another lifetime. daily assault senses intentional. state Australia went back lockdown. around 3000 active cases. got 60  Masks mandatory. heading week two 6 weeks lock down. Borders exist around city protecting regional areas. Can’t travel interstate. suspect wear masks least year. family member hospital visitors banned.  everyone returns school become common story.

Schools learning causing death. Yes, even disappear, killer cells protect and/or memory cells create new antibodies you’re infected make mobile broadband Chromebooks. wonder discounts schools get service those. studies suggesting kids spread much, i.e. conclusion, closure schools measurable direct impact number laboratory confirmed cases school-aged children Finland Sweden. negative effects closing schools must weighed positive indirect effects might mitigation covid-19 pandemic. coronavirus vaccines development based usual vaccine methods weakened dead virus, cold virus altered cause coronavirus antibodies.

Except Moderna's vaccine US, uses RNA create coronavirus antibodies, would first vaccine method ever approved human use. theory might safer contains virus all, live dead. terms reactions could possibly be, brand new territory. I’m assuming mean total reported cases TODAY Florida Texas adding 12,000 PER DAY moment. going take long one city centers overtake thing currently. Also, Cook County 5 MILLION people alone, second already mentioned LA county. Perspective matters. uhh.. accept gonna get it? kids due back school 3 weeks?! way thats gonna go well. im happy gots plit custody school moms part.. uhh.. bad time kids.. new kids almost 2, teaching mask odd soo odd raised. Imagine something went wrong vaccine first people die/turn zombies doctors, teachers, nurses. Ireland believe. Totally agree. truly gift day, every day. Again, heart goes wish well. masks hot 😉 US already paid. Deaths reported second die. Theres boatload procedures paperwork somebody officially reported dead.  could neglect patients different health problems.

It’s good neglect health problems, many problems also increase risk dying COVID. areas outbreaks big enough require lockdown, really isn’t good solution cancer patients. I'm going buy shoes! noticed websites india appearing around seem taking spot traditional UK tabloids, full enough real news make misinformation seem believable. suppose work involves 0 research curriculum doesn’t require live meeting lessons/interaction others...but students really learning? Might well give packet work. Extensive testing contact tracing. definitely one, feel like losing battle sanity little day passes. honestly know much longer take yeah vaccine would like answer million prayers.  finally using method provinces They'll retort COVID-19 hoax, like they've drivelling months. Who’s making fun America now? Don’t see many countries vaccine almost complete wow, what, three sundays ago record low since March? Thanks! check :)   deaths MIS-C since kids died New York? read article back top pediatrician saying really good treatment learned identity quickly expect fatalities it. curious held true. hope so. article paywalled read it. No, wasnt point. even read whole thing? getting stuck wrong part.... No. One study supports conclusion. It’s quite premature assume based one study. So, Uighur people got jobs become news fuck ccp. well paid guaranteed eating living free. anyone tell why. continues on:

""After losing mother sister coronavirus, Sherry Tutt wants others protect themselves.""

At ""end day"" someone dead - coming back. may seem hurt people can't go beach endless line cars, endless line death.

But living best option.

Here, delivery people call phone instead knocking, remind them. Way apartments house shares, I'd guess. That’s delusional idiots live. Glad see going better place.  I'm always saying vaccination one humanity's greatest achievements. We're witnessing history making, successful no. TIL, cool. use proper mask discipline, get protection mask well. works ways.

It’s hard. hope powers gentle kids years go help “catch up.” Awesome news, I'll believe see it. I'm type get really optimistic stuff. wanna idea covid fall winter look southern hemisphere get idea that. Keeping mind course people lot numerous northern hemisphere. problem people (who going die anyway, agree) die horrible way. Without beloved ones them.

Think ""normal non-covid"" seniors dying way quarantine. Elderly sick get spend final 6 months thier life anxious isolation. bad excuse care. What?? make shit up? mean, year there’s new cohort fresh grads teaching programs. Lots people choose from, right there.

As school, place ad position, hire them. It’s difficult incoming person would probably cheaper hire well, since they’re new school system. 

I think you, like average layperson, don’t realize schools often extend hiring process late summer. Sometimes people get hired right school year starts. training, you’re thrown it. I’m former teacher (changed careers last year) I’ve seen happen LOT. 

As perspective teachers decide leave position due health concerns - lots ways pivot. Maybe make less money while, that’s trade protecting health. hope too, that’s definite drawback problem. friend didn’t go details plan talked, know plan different students special needs. Ok buddy. Might time take break Reddit you. Yeah would expect people talking new data becomes available. talk whether it’s valid not. sub seems like good place that.

Or act dismissive new information even seeing doesn’t fit narrative.

It's something kind sucks take kind risks take every day get amounts 3-5 days worth tips(twice). can't refuse service people without masks even though there's county wide mandate place requiring businesses.

I hope make end shit without getting sick. I'm surprised yet bullshit customers do. Legend. Sweet. Thank all. I’ll wait days get tested Whether want call false simply semantics clearly people get sniffles. However, implication highly misleading since implies dangerous, killing people. trying equate mild illness, like mild cold. false everyway matters.  Around 10,000 U.K. 30,000 U.S. according last time saw numbers brought up. Absolutely massive needed.  mainly mean see cares needs concerns parts country white, religious, conservative/traditional, able-bodied supportive him--unless politically economically benefit whatever need is. (Though also think cares people money power that, provided hostile him.)

So, one poor, non-white, disabled, liberal, policy ... well, least important. make inconvenient Trump's goals famous successful, become *persona non grata* even public enemy (such reporters disease experts news bad, pollsters polls favor, civil rights activists business maybe 2A rights fought for).

The way see it, Trump elected president entire country, president base. still leadership duty even citizens support policy. care fundamental safety happiness citizens, ones like him. Trump understands fine difference president fan club President United States, able tell.

So example, again, think Trump would sorry alarmed reporters ever reported bad things disappeared. reporters despises largely American citizens. disturbs someone whose tasked working People would probably fine with, even happy, certain members citizenry disappeared. That's mean say care *some* parts US burned. whole thought process hilarious. ""We helping we're gonna help less time""  'bout churchy folks demanding constitutional rights infect fellow parishioners singing top lungs. reason rush. Online learning, hear, bad.

Insidious little bastards.  Less 70k. Car payment, owe taxes year, etc happen, rich first, world leaders, republicans time campaign November. rest us lucky get anything 2021... Yeah idk considering average track record vaccines. take years make test. want quick version 1.0 concoction Rate deaths per day still steady decline though. think it'll ok. lol  miss Dr. Acton. See, falling trap catering skeptics deniers.

Do really think 1999, covid-19 even existed, comparable situation? No, not. perfectly reasonable factual news article simply say 'boy dies experiencing covid-19 symptoms'. Literally *anyone* reasonable going read article conclude 'okay, could covid-19, gee, better keep taking seriously'. skeptics deniers get riled shrill fake news, blah blah. 

That's hole people happily sliding towards going go along it. Honestly, feel like delaying would much better people schools starting time. going close anyway cases spike teachers/kids start getting sick. instead forcing people adapt disappointment, let’s skip part go back we’re ready. US still damn virus. People pull ""victim"" card muh freedom. Churches persecuted, everyone else stay closed well. Worship home, wear mask, simple. They're diseases soul mind proliferated body. fucking hero you. know why? otherwise would medicine [ear nails I've read lot good paying jobs outside Burlington. small city far cities go.

Oh know. meant vacation. love country absolute shit president administration currently suffer through..... I'm Texan live Arlington. must say last couple weeks everyone masked up. Every store restaurant masks mandated public seems part. I've keeping family masked since March, health officials time saying pointless. 

Better late never.

Also think twice sending kiddo school. I'm going Kindergarten teaching daddy 5 year old daughter weeks that's going quite experience. absolutely trust Government ""leaders"" school officials claim anything sniffles kid sign Covid-19 death liability waiver form beginning classes person. yes, death waivers real. brother teacher sign one.

Stay safe healthy everyone. sounds good theory, based number “indecent exposure” citations get every summer mow lawn nude, isn’t universal opinion. walk around naked?  another sub, park somewhere Orlando.

kthxbai May suggest “Health Care Professionals?” honest would problem starting October going July 2021. friend told basically AC ride. Man dig it. sit back cool one interesting side note, friend retired air Force 20 years. told military first get new vaccines. prioritized, can't refuse. cousins district strategically parking busses near lower income areas, busses carrying wifi transmitters cover small group kids school issues chrome books. Flu shots usually copay insurances. I'm guessing since actually want population get vaccinated virus, insurance copay low (if all). Well mean could still find doesn’t work, case would found yet.  political issue. means science doesnt matter. taking sides now. India TV news!!! True, everyone wearing mask indoors. people careful aware symptoms. Testing masks widely avialable. Contact tracing apps appearing many countries. stablized, least Germany many countries. sub 500 cases managable vaccine found :) Sadly many USA want ridiculous idea chip vaccine. want goddamn hug. Still hoping Big Pharma going charge $2k / vaccine 10% cost. Big Pharma...... 2 factors determine severity pandemic:

1. dense population is.

2. dense population is. fine. speak English read correctly. kinda fun read way. Also, English language messed up. even open? brainless moron would want park like open Pandemic. Every time company like reopening stunt, set us back months.

I get article survived Covid symptoms far back 1999! secret living covid symptoms getting fucking organs removed. Maybe try covid since fixed covid symptoms!

Come man, disingenuous fuck way saying covid symptoms back 1999 disingenuous enough call lie. -- lie omission misrepresentation sensationalism.

This major article posted front page website multiple millions subscribers, ardent defender thread viewed tens thousands defending it. get much rooftops digital age. God's sake...there are, brain enough learn basic junior high school research... think beginning drastically underestimating cases compared death rate seemed higher. 

Werent doctors said exactly crucified? I'm thinking Bakerfield Duo John Ioannidis. sub sucks.  Whoever running moderation monumental prick. are. 

I 4 usernames instantly permabanned saying medical related statements fully back studies. don’t agree.

I’m fringe kook either. Passionate avoiding misinformation proper research. 

Whoever running sub grossly under-informed grossly arrogant banning anyone disagree with. Weird every ""socialist"" country Covid control Capitalist America festering it. actually right force us wear things, hence reason cant walk around public dick braindead fuck. There’s strong possibility every person world going need vaccine shit. vaccine works (produces antibodies), testing problems. I’m part mRNA covid trial one issues far besides soreness injection site small group (like ten) chills went away 24 hours.

People may dump moderna back fall. It’s literally everyone world needs. Everyone. think that's absolutely crucial sterile environment, well. 

You're fucking boss. forget it. 10k day. chance impact organs, unlucky attacks lungs. Catching second time could death sentence. virus also cause renal failure, kidney failure, brain damage, nervous system damage, vascular damage. gotten taste smell back luckier ones.

Indian govt imposed lockdown since March, still lockdown. sheer number people country makes controlling outbreak v difficult task.

Two main reasons - people getting relaxed nearly 3 weeks local cases, restarted parties gatherings.

Another potential reason lot people quarrantee upon entry, thanks government policy. free roam city without 14 days complusory quarrantee.  seatbelt car always hope future, never forever, however yes longer article suggests life go back normal. aren’t nearing ending trials testing, least close think ending it, added onto distributing actually administering vaccine may take many months. Yes, gotten pretty far. acting like know person? Trump also excellent grades prestigious college, according wife, paid father. really like argue huh? obviously downright wrong considering first comment saying went prestigious college therefor smart. Look, lazy fuckers would go gym healthy therefore immune.

/I hate /s this. I've injuries limited taken away physical activities used enjoy learning swim laps really nice. get exhausted, I'm sore like would playing basketball, running lifting weights. definitely recommend keeping it. Agreed. Covid hit hard. 
I think wait years real numbers though, surmortality best indicator. ( Death count differennt country ). 

The drama US équipement, scientific knowledge back march, already one worst death per capita, still enough sign talking seriously. Ding ding round 2 coming  independent dashboard connection federal numbers. firing impact federal numbers, also article 100% speculation disgruntled employee. That’s title literally said said fallacy. credible source actually supports original point? neither. 50 years ago. Science slightly advanced. hey leaving without Tim Hortons would fate worse death. show sympathy. break legs can't get around case growth steady couple weeks, trending upwards again.

Hospitalizations week behind cases, currently relatively level, presumably start trending upwards soon well.

Death numbers across state also trending up, follows month behind cases. rest peace, let world sing song.  much logic mean common sense understand. top 5 people who's opinions matter anti-maskers? Maybe dig Paul Rudd. lack sanity falls ""to sanity"", no? reported number likely stay close 10k/day figure though unless state increases ability test more. 10k/day past days likely met/exceeded max number samples possibly test per day *actual* number likely exceeded ten thousand/day. Seriously, fucking nobody Hollywood wearing masks, neighbors throwing ragers every weekend, easily 20-30 people. Pakistan's positivity rate falling down(below 10%now). terms tests/1M, born raised Ohio... painful read. new signature WWE move haha reason, lot infected people report harsh come back symptoms (after improvement) around 10 days onset symptoms. need anything many time hit hospitals.

There good solution here. post implied, say explicitly, action, certainly reasonable completely understandable (our highest duty care children) exacerbate problems schools face create harm students whose parents resources offer protections advantages children. 

Public school attempt create equity good nation. greatest danger parents ""opting out"" good children sacrifices well-being children. 

My middle ground suggestion would demand remote-only curriculum district (many offering this) hire ""teaching assistant"" facilitate extend classes. would deprive school tax dollars desperately need, would allow children &amp; family part school community hopefully stay safe return face-to-face instruction, ensuring parents work need to. 

If feeling particularly magnanimous, perhaps take pains invite single parents group find ways otherwise support families may choices do. simply one other?

Many people realize surgical masks meant protect others you. works every single person wearing it. vaccine, *and* cure treatment, yes.

Vaccines one thing; they're prime importance. vaccine, control outbreaks, stop even happening first place.

However, ideal situation cure treatment, too. can't, won't, vaccinated.

Catching COVID-19 case means trip doctor, hospital, something prevent inflammation hyper-immune response leads infection worsening.

But yeah, place, majority populations innoculated, start return normal.

I think behaviour may stick around, though, people realise masks, distancing, increased cleanliness, better every day sanitisation lead lower risk contagion general.   ship came from. Seem like company run coastal vessels, probably sea long begin with. Yes! believe lag patient fatality month behind. takes while(30d?). Even death rate 1/10th used be, lag certainly going present continued rise (not mention long term effects, we’ve seen reports breathing, possible brain cognitive issues, I’m seeing concerns organs). 

One thing lasting effects. Chickenpox virus, people live life dormant near nerves back. 50years, 1/2 reactivate presenting shingles. painful. don’t KNOW thing yet. Semantic difference....yeah, welcome law. Face shields protect eyes. absolutely interchangeable masks, used together refence meme pewdielie :P again, depends country.
In Malta, 15% flat rate anything outside Malta, 30% income Malta. 

Yes, France/Spain/Belgium higher sure. 

But honest, work way:

France: 30% income tax + 15% social tax
USA: 24% income tax + X fixed rate private healthcare covers - pay, etc.

That comparison made, trying get Europe, even though tax + social tax + VAT expensive, we're still good position overall vs accident cancer American.

Apples Oranges guess :) said - perfect system! allowed travel ireland 

Ireland part EU EU banned americans enter. So... forget listening weekend, healthcare worker clearly fed delusional segment complaining closed something like, ""until one day they're shower can't smell shampoo."" nonsense seems start making sense, nonsense. really getting difficult continue showing compassion segments American population mayor Barcelona idiot. 

Way back February, beginning pandemic Europe, Mobile World Conference Barcelona cancelled major companies pulled due concerns COVID-19. conference big deal city cancellation serious regard status pandemic economic impact Barcelona. 

What mayor do?

She goes record it’s okay conference didn’t really matter 5G wasn’t important. 

Yeah, don’t expect much that. white man South trying put gag order black woman. seen before? (unfortunately) [popular reading it, doesn’t seem fake news thing. know virus real. Seems like “my freedoms” thing. Although certainly latch onto news even remotely doubts mask effectiveness.

There “this hoax” “it’s overblown” people, seem mostly 5-10 percent people naturally drawn conspiracy theories. 

Sadly, “friends” anti-mask category, theory they’re people early stages grief (denial). way lived 2019 fundamentally different way we’ll live 2021, maybe even forever. people, it’s easier reject reality attack things different (masks, distancing, etc.). Yeah. Quite years old largely silent accounts fairly new accounts specific interests coronavirus China. interestingly, concerted revisiting re-downvoting posts crept back up. seen before. million doses vaccine... option acquire 40 million doses vaccine proven safe Chinizium genetically modified juice yeeeah thanks. rehab centers set America, would need $$$ go. Many Americans would simply use counter meds nothing all.
The haves nots, government care USA higher testing rate per capita compared every single country EU 😂

Sounds like CO state governor wants whine. politician lacking empathy! could guessed? /Sarcasm Great news! let’s something bill doesn’t cripple Americans Meh. Nys highly income (and sales) tax driven. unemployment slow means state basically bankrupt.. That's fair point. Although la hotspot shutting it...going somewhere else still want go party good way promote public health. 

I'm honestly bit shocked selfish people even slightest restrictions save lots lives. moderna sounds like massive stock pump dump me. enough test kits go around... leverage them. Democracy beginning struggle, end objective. Tough situation think good kids. best you. already know they're going lose election, need set country fail like everytime dems take over. shortsighted idiots somehow think ten year economic slump causes democrats' fault. basically guaranteed nothing stop it. idiot Lol, obviously trolling like it. could almost predict top 10 stories highlighted sub morning. wonder people around ever get tired reading story. Absolutely nonsensical. live bizarro world. darkest timeline. Well, technically free file bankruptcy it!

*taps head* Got friend equates forcing mask wearing government “tyranny”. 

My reply “Are seatbelts, helmets, life vests, preventing drunk driving tyranny? No. It’s protect people dumb asses like you.” Store manager gonna fight dominance now.  Right essential workers underpaid? GTFO nonsense. wearing helmet also affects others, paramedics scrape brains road nurse (that would me) PTSD seeing brains coming ears nose. It’s pretty. Kemperor Palpatine Wow. nice dude, Canada big country. assure accents pronunciations vary widely across country. Much like variation accent someone Minnesota versus Texas.  want visit visits job make quarantine 14 days. Since recently started PTO. Would interesting reject people rural counties need ventilators. want tough? try venting straws Applebees! drive drunk? Would support overturning drunk driving laws? laws drunk driving infringement freedom order protect drivers innocent pedestrians reckless actions individual. 

Yet drunk driving *only* killed 10,500 Americans last year. virus killed 140,000 far year. Thus, every non-mask wearer drunk driver road potential kill injure somebody. 

A **temporary** mask mandate protect others, someone virus. refuse wear reckless selfish drunk driver. 

Are really side recklessness name freedom? Yea Sounds like rightwing BS masks infecting Maybe people, testing let’s know symptoms something else. Yeah know someone similar boat, except already collapsed going run brain dead life support. No. United States gets covid control, safe thing country prevent us getting land all. It’s probably 30k+ already can’t test fast enough Non-believers can't convinced, minds made up. waste time. Peru's lockdown efforts stricter US. One huge factor limited public health system lack social safety net, driving people choose starving working hopefully dying. Congress back session today, expecting something relatively quick Yup. Republican strategy November becoming painfully clear: make dangerous go vote left leaning regions... mean tf cares constitution allow seat belts masks pandemic. cars back also know viruses were. I'm saying things unconstitutional are, amendments for?

Edit: attack you, agree Devolved word. Nice wish ppl saw ur BC/AD joke bad. got islands mixed up! Married one child combined income around 110k. mention since us, talking income tax. pay social security Medicare regardless lot, especially among people 45. [13 extra deaths every COVID death among people &lt;45 pneumonia deaths, expect MI/stroke/aneurysm... No, covid. Really dumb analogy.  rock solid leadership. talking Baseball? :) likely fax individual death certificates. ‽ ‽ Exactly, saw someone claim need lockdown 5-10 years, deranged fantasising. Also absolute rage seeing people going beach even though chance spreading Covid approaching zero. fucking crazy what's reason that? There's hundreds companies researching Can’t afford move. people really need know this. always make distinctions conversation SARS-CoV-2 (I sometimes shorten SARS 2) Covid-19.

I found funny Televangelist Ken Copeland “blew wind god” Covid-19 ignoring virus actually causes it. Eh cant comment much uighyur (yet) gone research subject judge, remember pretty atrocious pieces , like people didnt full research sound good someone isnt versed politics region. obvious u r there.Their tone tends Fluffy hit pieces too. Imo Foreign policy eg offers nuanced take.


Nyt football decent written Lowe tho. Unconstitutional masks, underwear mask balls? Ah yes. meant post guy lol. anyway, yes. could really use non covid medical assistance people really sick feel comfortable going doctor's without risking catching it. blame Fox News point many people still believe coronavirus “hoax,” despite total complete global shutdown. “news” organization purposefully misleading audience failing accurately report pandemic. know Obama President right now, Fox News would filly report Covid19 real, deadly, blame President enough keep Americans safe.

Maybe special episode ER Greys Anatomy shows favourite characters responding pandemic, unable save patients suffering ptsd burnout. Sometimes people respond stronger fictionalized events reality. Like movie Band Played AIDS epidemic. to, they're Republicans, they're hypocrites. LOL You’re naive don’t totally blame ignorance. work though. learning Algebra 1 learn everything need know properly, doomed Algebra 2 Trig Calculus. Things build can't skip step. foreign language. I’ve unemployed four months received $0.00 unemployment payment since pandemic began. can’t reach single representative bank member rectify current position. week, 28 million Americans face scenario.

We’ll streets protesting, nothing else do, nothing lose.  boyfriend would also wait American vaccine, we're anti-vaxxers sense word. want inject anything endorsed man obsessed beans, franks, injecting bleach. trust administration known wonderful quotes as, ""We can't let science get way X"". Trump used power successfully break law fallout many times - could see using executive power pass harmful vaccine despite warned 80 times it'll actually hurt people.


Meanwhile, point, successful one comes Oxford, I'd willing take month released first wave shots administered.  Ps don’t go anywhere!! Stay home! Stay safe! Good, selfish contrarians like reason ~~130K~~ 143K Americans died needlessly. Shame making us waste public resources protect them.

EDIT: 143K Americans died Covid-19 boomers. controlling pandemic earlier backfire terms economy. countries like EU Asia recovering may end ahead US getting poorer day. Baby steps answer. Kemp, dumbest game chicken ever played. History never forgive you. 3.6 roentgen. great. terrible We’ll (Americans) let little well known secret all, trump lies everything says. Like 100%. sound comes large hold center face, it’s lie.  worked research side. They’re close. giant boat within hour downtown would probably beneficial I'm sure else do, honestly. opponent stacks deck refuses obey rules *and* bought referees, option left violence. stark reality case armed revolution, right wing that's much likely win. 

That's said really, matter happens election, comes 12:01 January 20. point (presuming election happens, presuming Biden elected) either:

1) Trump leaves peacefully (not gonna happen; AG NY waiting moment)

2) military recognizes authority new President (either Biden, Pelosi Acting Trump ignores election results) physically removes White House (possibly sparking armed insurrection MAGA Q types)

3) Trump's installation loyalists Pentagon pays off, stays WH, American experiment definitively Paranoia denial there. Corpsmen basically medical unit Navy/marines. enlisted corpsman basically nurses, officer corpsman doctors. See thing regards Instagram types going la Vegas many times going post story? joke.....I saw Trump 2020 mask worn correctly hardware store yesterday. Die quit job? think choice easy...  dead now, killed Republicans, make feel? reminds ""male gail"" episode himym personal attack, respond call such. see article referred to. find these:

""AstraZeneca says press release gearing start deliver Oxford vaccine September—the U.K. government announced it’s first line supported Oxford group—and capacity supply 1 billion doses unspecified date 2021. company inked deals funders committed “the fair allocation distribution vaccine around world.”

-- capacity supply 1 billion doses 2021. That's need. Less stop pandemic america. 

The first doses earmarked emergency use, military use, stockpile, essential HCPs. Vaccines delivered 2 doses 28 days apart (at least, older people, immune issues, need more). 

And stated earlier, inventory loss damage inevitable also factored equation.

There's way enough doses vaccine ready 2020 distribute americans. noticed watching testing america, distributing billion glass doses easy, planned like military operation, we've demonstrated ability pull off, all, way. close store entirely union voted in. open another one nearby funnel business next

Asterisk. UK stopped publishing figures admitted they've overcounted. Missourian here. put idiot perspective forced live backwater shithole: He's replacement got elected Republican governor got trouble blackmailing mistress. Cream crop. right!!!!!!!! cares pandemic, don’t want wear mask!!!!! messed accidentally put AliExpress biggest moron who's defending selfish, arrogant assholes put lives others risk refusing wear mask you. fact fail grasp repugnant shows one who's lacking comprehension. smart run assumption may give permanent immunity. great, enough doses later rather get caught paying price goes up. Luckily lot old people Florida.
/s Yep. irresponsible, make LOT people sick. I’ve quarantined abundance caution many people don’t get positive result? That’s awesome you’re wanting employees. Worst case, say seems mask + shield used together pretty good protection level. 'says' problem. Ignorant people, lets see opinion changes / loved ones get it. he's using covid funds spread covid? mean, honestly, leave major city mostly ignorant rednecks meth, fucking sisters, screaming black people devil. Huh? American, Cubas looking better better. EVERYTHING BIGGER TEXAS! Shut em’ down! cite lab this? Reinfections anectdotal best, least far norm people worst. Immunity SARS, similar coronavirus, lasted 4-10 YEARS (helper T-cells). may similar lengths immunity vaccine. vaccines produced SARS-CoV-2 quite similar polio flu, require incubation chicken's eggs, neither oxford vaccine moderna vaccine requisite, massively reducing production/trial times. #**Thanks, GOP!**  People fend themselves. shame govt doesnt back common sense though Whaaaaaat

No waaaaaay people ever say shit like ones hospital beds. ""hurr die die"" children. say get sick whinge like newborn puppy pissing corner playing victim. Pathetic. People say denied hospital access doctors nurses look face say ""oh well, die die right"" get dragged door. bad people human that, crying enough. Belgium fundamental problem one half country dislikes other, vice versa. applies government too. mess. lived Brussels 5 months, nice city, yeah, bit mess haha! Oh good. 

You know learning second language difficult, enough practice time i’ll acquire vernacular colloquialism communicate concordant matter vis-á-vis americans. struggle endeavour mastering english language, ergo, hope articulated less proper manner assumed made mistake. 

I glad understand meant. locality two ""hospitals"" *no* ICU units. Anything parking garage minute-clinic ER called ""hospital"" now. says ""Hospital"" sign, little office building doctors' offices x-ray lab. least name Covid 🤷‍♀️ really crazy. Sometimes think “maybe it’s bad...” could see could lead people careless. Yea seriously. Sweden 5,600 deaths. around 5,000 *for ever*. new cases lowest since March, daily deaths *single digits*.


What's issue? Totally agree. someone went high school AZ nearly 2000 kids, there’s way could ever work How, years shit, still making exact ****wrong**** assumptions people making since Trump’s approach helping repubs. ever time deviate trump playbook, it’s clearly now.

Please show literally evidence this. live Florida hotspot. People don’t talk governor. talk masks hoaxes shutdowns job.

You’re spouting exact horseshit every news station whole year leading 2016 election, yet people office facing major problems election precisely 0 evidence bad Republicans. 

You incredibly delusional think rank file republicans gonna deviate Trump playbook; worked well. major consequences them, vocal minority online insisting TIME really fucked up, nothing changing. imagine another scenario homeless person needs buy bagel. mask. needs eat. make business pay mask. say yes. low opinion current American government, I’ve always good feelings American people. see many everyday Americans acting without thought care other, gathering huge parties, staunchly refusing wear masks etc, disappointing upsetting. 

I guess thought still enough good old fashioned American can-do spirit pulls people together hard times. know still plenty reasonable Americans trying act responsibly terrified loved ones feel sorry them. seems like devastatingly outnumbered selfish assholes gospel “fuck you, got mine” ingrained trumps effort make people act others’ best interests. People fall category keep kids home they're concerned. teachers high risk go disability truly dangerous go work.

What I've found virus everyone would previously consider healthy magically high risk. SPREAD COVID-19 BASED TWO FACTORS...

1. dense population is. 
2. dense population is. Really?

Where learn more? :)  NJ similar website. checked see got ballot. had, counted looked. 

I waited absolute last day fill put mail.

I'm planning getting ballot earlier actual election. want make sure vote counted. ballot ""lost mail"" invalidated signature mis-match want know still something it. election important election I've ever participated in. think guys reach point employ veterinarians? Serious question. That's exactly doing, called phase testing. Masks protect wearer well protecting others......this shouldn’t need saying. Fun fact, like week two ago, Florida still posting deaths May. MAY. ~~found~~ **run** Airbnb Lexington near downtown, decent neighborhood, $661 month:

Fixed makes perfect sense me. easily punish business without using force, businesses already buy supplies operate safely cleanly, businesses literally give masks people can't afford forgot home whatever, end result wider coverage faces, fewer tax dollars spent physically wrestling people ground pandemic. Right?! wear seatbelts strap kid car seat either?? kids fine trip grocery store. national movement antibody testing plasma donation?! commercials every break, every channel. incentivized. found sprays? They’re sold me.  great news. Phew... feel safe go back /s never heard flu vaccine? understand less susceptible. also might thing....
They carry disease body clothes home, nothing ace2.
Kids infectious best plausible theory.
Putting groups people small areas, share airspace, moving areas, washrooms basically petrie dish ideal conditions growth. matter small amount grows slowly? Kids parents families. School fun.
Communities destroyed. high risk kids? incredibly short sighted. would take care child since parents high risk? 🧐 girlfriend server 1/3 staff tested positive decided test whole staff. 9 days ago haven’t gotten results back restaurant anyone doesn’t symptoms work. It’s madness here. what’s opposite instant karma??? neighbor still says numbers fake... opposite way.

car accident deaths still counted covid... motive something w/ hospitals billing insurance companies? Starting wonder real virus is. saying Wife last night. called covid fatigue. seems like done CDC/WHO/HHS/BMJ months (dont go anywhere need. Mask on, distance hand wash). months see many people ignoring signs businesses willienilly going lives easy get complacent. Especially kids mix. Stay strong! There's others supporting you! Can't remember said it, medical professional talking 'deaths lagging indicators' actually way less now. combination much younger people getting it, plus treatments better, plus stopped things actually increased mortality, like putting people vents prematurely. good things. think treatments continue improve knowledge base hopefully culminates safe effective vaccine option end year, even earlier hype companies touting truth. thinks could people aren’t seeing usual network support. encouragement make phone call come from.

How suppose make feel better? want actual connection. want someone life actually cares me. called hotlines. 15 mins try get phone. don’t give shit. 

I slit wrist yesterday. I’m tired alive. wish something OD on. want make appointment get Benzos that. 

There point living anymore. life never going improve. thought going finish school, nice middle class job finally met someone year. None going happen. Well part trials, know that's robust studies want. sadly the... even call them, Covid deniers? do. loved one, believe. change you. Source: lived 28 years getting dumber day lol named kid “rowdy?” Lol wtf  Laughing spreads Covid good job lol worries. governor said ""blip"". /S seriously believe media politicians concerned letting us get gripped fear, cause fear causes anarchistic tendencies gone unchecked. virus worse hear, proof reasonable explanation lot deaths. 

This cause panic, understandably concern.

They deluded think can't figure what's happening without telling us. information era, old people running world old date know propaganda work like used to.

Fox news still uses coined term, ""the cure worse desease."" joke. everything reddit taken seriously. friends started playing division joking training christmas. Sun Flu state live Australia, Victoria, going bit second wave we've got one highest testing rates world (per capita) results 2-4 days usually. also one lowest death rates world assume that's we're actually identifying majority cases whereas America physically can't enough tests keep up. rest world laughing say shit like that. Shut close loop holes cannot wait move intellect forsaken place. level general ignorance astonishing. top off, it’s people proud fucken stupid. I'm pretty livid company. 16 people got it. send anyone home? Nope. 

I work company sells cloud solutions day long. vast majority us fully capable working home. want us ""efficiency."" kids get sick get people sick time. There's nothing inherently special covid regard. high risk, stay away kids. Parks camping safe stay isolated others. Would also easier give public instructions bunch different ways make masks home could help save masks healthcare.  pay it

Your privilege showing. realize many millions Americans barely even afford food family, never less whilst paying exorbitant delivery fees?  Yep, I’m currently 7 days results yet. (Florida) ""Not yet peer-reviewed"" Heck boss got back Florida week long vacation. could go wrong? best buddy panhandle. make Facebook post telling everyone positive sixth seventh July got results back yesterday got test done sixth. eveyone gets infected one dies... whats concern?

It looks extremely likely disease cause long-term health problems, including respiratory issues. new vaccine, modification one already studied proven safe. many 11am fevers. Like clockwork.

Definitely that's Tylenol doped sending school wore ... trust numbers coming Texas Florida much trust Brazil's now. mean, workers going it, unionize?  ""The governor also recited research said demonstrates infections children adults rare.""

The fuck? read multiple science journals stated exact opposite. 

Will 'People' ever wake see chains slavery? really hope American people tolerate it, would crime. drug company time would profit worldwide catastrophe literal blood hands. nah. less exactly anti-vaxxer would say. would also say without type research, would led fact vaccine actually studied years proven safe. Plugging Sars2 MERS change that. sister never progressed symptoms. went ER thinking Lyme Disease told fungal infection, prescribed fungal cream prednisone.  told maybe towels aired fully?

She using items noticed reduction symptoms COVID. what. Cost extremely low us. That’s really matters right would also imagine would vary location. Like I'd imagine California Florida would get first dibs due infected opposed somewhere like Kansas. definitely going hit rural areas hard point. worked location rural area one hottest areas OH. One employees harassing one guys wearing mask literally one 50+ employees wearing them. Told arent worried getting giving them. don’t want spread around easily could careless. It’s ridiculous people actively argue mask wearers. it’s preference, fuck off. House without AC fucking die virus? think I’ll take AC Wow. That's crazy. test weekly China get results end day. hope get better US Weird think failing control spread, even benefit knowledge gained outbreaks early on, ""good job."" anyone tell Brazil's hospitals overflooding yet?

Because sure 2 3 weeks ago everyone saying Brazil ""right edge catastrophe"" hospitals flooded.

And think might missed news that? Brazil currently #12 death worse many ways. (Source: American.) expected better attendees event named 'Suck, Bang, Blow' WTF.

Yes stay home sick. supposed get food? fucking pay it. 

If can't afford ask help. 

Ask family.

Ask neighbor.

I'm sure someone help you.

You must go proximity people, even mildly symptomatic. Keep mind, test results nearly 2 weeks old. spread actually much worse. Yes, looking purely real estate immigration standpoint. considering, (and retrospect regret considering) Americans general probably good place right financially. read US Reddit, think Canadians truly appreciate bad US right now, least parts. mistake apologize.

I tell this.........a back, engineering contract worker work. ethnicity Indian (India Indian), became good friends. ethnicity Welsh. talked length India Canada, five years so. One day asked relatives Canada, that's also came Canada. said, ""No, family here"". said, ""If mind asking, choose Canada countries?"". said, ""Well, time know, countries parts world, racism much here..........there racism too, much less countries"". shocked. really was.

I watched comedy bit coming Montreal day, black US comedian stage. said, ""I love Canada, love Montreal. Here, walk around streets hated. Well, still hated too, here, I'm hated black..............here hated can't speak french.........."". Canadian would know funny is.

Racism stupidest thing man ever invented.  Appreciate love! Unfortunately true , could much fine, probably pass quickly, there's false positives well. Cases like feel better days normally little risk getting worse!  starts happening America people ask ""How happen?"" pendulum swing theses guys Study data shoes largely correct: protests surprisingly little effect case rates. 3 months lockdowns enough? experts telling us need more? ever happened '2 weeks flatten curve'? 3 months flattening enough? Experts told us way go. like 'experts' keep getting wrong keep insisting know better everyone must obey.  know that. know analogy pretty stupid. Guess depends school size. school size old high school, someone die, there’s enough people population * infection rate * death rate 1 I'm quite conspiracy theories could right. sue Savannah either that's 54% black Racism worse many places world. Australia, UK, France etc. Trust brown person UK. daily deaths declined considerably since april us kid getting people sick? Getting teachers sick, getting family sick, getting friends families sick? virus infectious, kids good maintaining recommended hygiene practices. one sick kid non serious case infect dozens people, long lasting health issues die. recklessly ok this?  Unfortunately cant florida. read somewhere lose pensions licenses/certs. gut feel enjoying summer autumn/winter good.

I'm Melbourne winter spread extremely rapid virus leaked hotel quarantine. Exhibit A, Chuck Woolery article strangely enough offer much detail, example symptoms discovered. Personally, I'd want hear full story drawing conclusions. Brazilian, something maybe, maybe, help, shit is, budget now, still public health care, right now, got. Let's see defunded public health care richest private health care, hope us two countries get shit together start fighting this, IMO, laughable virus, low fatality rate kryptonite layer cloth.  doubted America would one day President boasting National TV care Army says, decided. doubted America would President would boast identifying lion elephant piece paper, drawing clock.

Anything happen now.

Kanye 2020. (lul) point Americans considered refugees  also noted vaccine created would fall 'failed' status natural immunity.

Their doubts vs established sciences really incite fear eh? one original places reported happening person replying asking whether, (because happened NY weeks peak) meant something progression disease LA. Somewhat, drugs improved treatment helping. none improvements major breakthroughs, percent reduction time, much pretty hard say, we're still miles something stop worrying about. improvement add longer delay outbreaks people saved. 92 day 71% humidity Florida. Lets talk mosquitos.

This work places others. Replace mask tracking device. Still ok? climate change geopolitical shit... pretty fair guess... people downvoting it’s fairly well established fact based data available scientists medical professionals far? Fear? Denial? Neither erase facts. need national level walkout. Enough enough country. friend's wife teacher posted writing health directives anticipation school year.

I'm angry words formulate express it. sea angry red mind we're even juncture.

Has entire US gone mad? 

Place sample (a couple drops) plate. Lite match. flame burns blue ok, flame yellow safe. Note blue flame may difficult see yellow flame visibly consistently yellow. Impurities may cause momentary yellow flash normal.  helps dimly lit room. 

*Be careful burn surroundings. flame couple drops would inch less high feel 4 inches it.*  

The article describes precise test method people able do.   

**Note** Isopropyl alcohol also burns yellow flame so... test works Ethyl alcohol/ethanol main ingredient may conclusive methanol. However, says Ethyl alcohol burn blue ethyl alcohol doesn't. IDK smell isopropyl compares ethanol methanol. delusional segment America consider fake news. strikes one family give fuck Pack important shit hall ass state awhile? Got friends live outside state could quarantine basement with? Best luck, stay safe. Americans pay taxes measurably lower EU, 10% average. substantially higher incomes. So, point wrong. Taxes aren’t same. 

We argue it’s good thing not, taxes same. outcome Darwinian...  **also** negotiated expand Scottish facility allow production 100 million doses UK around world.

That related (future) commitment expanding Scottish facility business, directly doses ordered UK. Trump remembered nothing. entirely states deal virus...

The urban centers locked early leveled curve fire financial straits. rural areas stayed open spiking they've singing, ""the virus here!"" long take hit pride take appropriate measures.

The US study timing response centralized vs decentralized approaches. [Here’s clearly states 300m US September/October. call person? Messenger death? right, they're definitely far better most. go Champlain College similar. However, concern specifically living campus. know several people already come back gone straight back partying, one particular told planning getting tested, breaking quarantine ""they can't really enforce it.""

For part, seems like effect minimal compared rest country. still frustrating though know still likely see significant increase cases, far summer pretty nice isolated .  Hahaha, yeah meaning certainly changed! resources people safely it. So, sounds like sailors thought disease subject reporting 24h docking rule? least notified docking, guess that's good. Bit late, think? people familiar geopolitical situation, Xinjiang politically unstable part mainland China. region Muslim Uyghurs majority long history resistance suspicion Han ethnical majority CCP government. See government control like Wuhan Beijing. also said opening schools important possible. say people label cold blooded murderer. New Zealand, option stay home come back school, everyone else stay home. case every single vaccine useless months.

You cannot test protein remnants victims body months fact call infection. israeli quack recently announced reinfected, old shitty protein test. Honestly seeing changes (even video someone posted meant show us horribly it’s actually playing IRL), someone probably put Disney’s people charge state bit. evils larger company etc, design quality parks something I’ve always appreciated . Seeing reopen made start lose faith “guest experience” priorities, want design signs rest state/country mask rules. First place I’ve seen actually spell “no really, hold damn breath face, cheating.” love sweden, cannot figure behind slow motion fuck-up corona response. 

Umm ... something missing Sweden?

Cases down. Deaths See, I'm you. discouraging people power think way. 

Brain drain going become serious issue country. know many professors graduate students involvement research group university... there's pretty open talk leaving country sometimes. pulse oximeter hugely helpful dad stepmom got Covid. saved multiple trips ER night. doctor said come hospital dropped 92 though. called level orange. (During level red kids school) looks like pretty bad news, one must also consider two things - people work home, sale bikes skyrocketed.

Looking facts, might good news disguise - news Sweden heading greener future! highly doubt that. I’m Bahamas. Even borders “officially closed” residents moving country private aircraft vessels, average citizen couldn’t get repatriation flight home. happened mostly secret would explained away officials found out. rest nation strict lockdown, least resort community (Albany) free operate usual. government kowtows ultra rich. saying never told before, get sick go front line union insurance elderly. realize go, hospital start war triage 65 yr old bad heart bottom list. idiot-in-chief gets way regards giving businesses immunity... Monoclonal antibodies great niche tool.

I remember reading they're massively expensive difficult up-scale terms production, however. takes one month person become feral able withstand tough conditions. definitely done. - evidence longterm immunity COVID fact, evidence indicating ever immunity achieved could short term. idea ""herd immunity"" may 100% bullshit Indian here, know worst part? People getting visiting hospitals now. Local pharmacists telling people stay home show symptoms going hospital infect 100%. means number even higher also extremely poor people even hospitals go number lot Scarier that. think pig immune system? damn that's crazy, almost like big daily gathering humans really likely spread highly contagious disease Quite likely. Better outdoor air anyway, heat factor.

Your 'child charge' done well already poor image USA holds. he's fucking people though...mucho bado man. feel like whiplash different rhetorics getting thrown around.

It's like two different worlds, reading US news Reddit government freaking 100 cases per day... Apparently nobody thread follows news closely. AstraZeneca announced won’t selling vaccine profit. means it’ll cost like $3. “Oh it’s US tho it’ll expensive!!!” problem big pharma price restrictions US making shit expensive. state third would shithole critical job. appreciate hard work! 

There HUGE problem testing takes 2 weeks come back - contact tracers calling people already sick infecting others. sigh. Stories like give covid19 personal face important. 
Good story takeaways like lingering effects. let fire insubordination, obviously Watching two minutes reaffirms opinion “Disney people” weird shit. Hahaha ""I Legend."" must missed last weekends, see zombies roaming Central Park SoHo West Village. least Vegas still US. Even though healthcare system leaves lot desired, still better lot poorer countries terms access medical facilities. poorer countries entitled tourists want go to, US dollars go hang beach without care wellbeing actual natives.  shit gets really wild Florida

knowing Florida, that's going zombie apocalypse levels crazy people actually take note think favorite tax get refund state feds want tax refund. Somewhere Freddy humming: “Is real life fantasy” haha shitshow. left Florida 2 months early Mid March get fuck one taking COVID seriously RV park point Park management lock pool clubhouse use ever. COVID running wild shake head people still takes. bad can't deny treatment ignored rules. primary function public schools childcare parents working. I'm recent college graduate engineering degree, hopefully country would interested that. completely lack trying, plus arrogance.

It's simply hard get news inside China. care, believe, think vulnerable (back Jan, people even ask white people immune this, ffs). exactly half America thinks masks nothing. surveyed coronavirus survivor Facebook group identified 100 different symptoms, including fatigue, pain, difficulty sleeping, heart palpitations, neuropathy, tinnitus, tremors, blurry vision memory problems

Throw chronic Lyme fibromyalgia. You’re sort making opposite point. 

Outbreaks happening rest life. virus isn’t going anywhere, likely ever, even vaccine. 

So countries, Japan, learned control virus without lockdowns ones listening unless think world locking forever actual solution. Captain full responsibility.

I’ve seen what’s going eyes. thousandth time thread. AZN isn’t selling profit lol Goldman Sachs - national mask mandate would save US GDP 5%.

(not directed you, OP!) Saying Florida ever actually ""shut down"" nonsense. Check mobility data. People basically skipped rounds golf mildly inconvenienced restaurants closing 2 weeks. full commitment government residents actually shut down. Compare mobility data northeast states, see almost 0% mobility nearly 2 full months. FL (and others) needs RIGHT order get thing control, they're anything instead. 

Stay fuck home, people. need get groceries, wear fucking masks use hand sanitizer soon leave. But, perhaps spend time outfitting schools function pandemic - especially drive reopen - need make safe. Dumbest analogy I've ever heard *some Canadians. say ""about"" proper way, bilingual people Quebec. COVID cases confirmed without labwork. surrvilance case reporting. depends hospital. run in-house one work usually get resulted 2ish hours. We've beat plenty viruses before. countries well road beating one. We're unique point failure right now. travel around mask 24/7 pandemic, chances involved infectious disease chain ended giving elderly person pneumonia killing them.

Your sociopathy showing. flatten it. wrong axis. confined space virus makes easier people catch them. Masks social distancing help along good hygiene mere deterrents give 100% protection virus. anyone ever played mmorpg's like RO. odds upgrading equipment highest form small chance, like maybe 1%.

That said, turn pages book gloves needed kinds temperatures. want positive news virus. remember thinking crazy first came could get infected talking (not sneezing coughing).

Lol France masks stock French government said masks useless, unproven possibly increases risk contamination know wear them. stock, mandatory going fine left right.

I’ve following woman’s story past days. tweeted doctors gave options placed ventilator 88% chance death palliative care DNR. shook core imagine situation like that.

Good people, good work (my experience) Nice optimistic. strange one seems understand HUGE LOOPHOLE rule: executives CANCEL planned stock sale time. 

In words, executives frequently set planned sales years advance. example, Elon Musk set 105-B-1 $50,000,000 stock sale Aug 1 2021. approaches date, thinks stock overvalued, simply allow sale go cash stocks getting good. However, thinks stock undervalued, would cancel sale. 

Hope sheds light matter.  What's point pooling high positivity rate? Every pool sample gunna come back positive gunna re-test everyone you? Pooling make sense trying find 100-200 positive cases sample million tests, 50,000 positives sample million. wearing mask infected?  social distancing?  contact traced encountered? really messed up. Especially people got tiny amount softdrugs. weed? COVID-19!

Edit: spelling Also conveniently ignoring totally differently constitutes 'covid-19' death. Someone could die heart attack antibodies would classified covid-19 death multiple European countries. Give three weeks, death rate skyrocket Doubling, Tripling down, fool. 

-The story america shithole  open, close, open, close, open, close people suggesting.

No. need responsible planning enforcement. social distancing mask usage required state re-opens, would problem. Look early hotspot [states like since successful recoveries. They're still going need maintain vigilance vaccine developed, they're shut back either. It’s ideological thing.

Americans largely believe government limited make people do. People don’t really understand what’s going see mask mandates think “what? government’s supposed tell us wear.”

They don’t really think purpose government much, thought process “small government good, big government bad”. take internet others peoples words seriously. Learn care free attitude. live longer. work feds heard next year VA going heath care vets Walmart’s rural locations around country

Because always hospital there’s always Walmart- people sure like Walmart

Crazy guy worse Trump. 

Yup, said it. I’m 30 women. much time left start family. want join professional workforce 35 work I’m 80 years old qualify retirement. clock ticking. 

You know like me. “get better.” Meeting people dating gets worse age. Everyone 3+ kids divorce baggage. 

I know life doesn’t follow “script.” shit want finally accomplish. lonely. feel like loser. 

Please reply this. helping. Leave alone. understand. going this.

When 30, driving shitty car delivery groceries living quality men don’t want date you. want another professional date. fucking loser. friends. People don’t want friends broke loser. family soon 9/11 probably best Disney trip life. like whole place yourself. Almost every ride operator told us stay want go another round, rides like Dumbo Astro Orbiter would keep 3-4 times long. Frequently buses entirely lot drivers real route; they'd take needed go. relative mine lives FL. wife wedding beach photography.

We recently emailed telling news overblown. people trying make Trump look bad.

Beach weddings booming, much reject clients he's busy. 

He even proudly sent photo recent shoot pointed everyone happy without masks! They're great time!  Ah okay. I’m sure gatherings 50,000+ people completely safe fucking pandemic. naive? I’m sure it’s bad someone admit “well yeah maybe protests part spread.” Instead, people say “Nope wore masks protests there’s possible way virus could spread.” know ignorant sounds? Florida, lack industry way trapping normal residents. wording law says “... another allotment district afford”. won’t getting raises time soon, won’t 47,500. 

The headlines clickbait basically. Right, considering people said would happen country didnt shut ... 5000 actually really good! 

I mean .. promises *apocalypse* countries didnt shut down. Flooded hospitals. Bodies street.

Sweden didnt see that.

It specifically drop ball seniors facilities, true. shame, boneheaded politicians made better call there, would 1000s fewer deaths would nothing criticize Sweden all! would total success story. Nope. bubonic plague surfaced throughout history. better sanitation healthcare “gone away” still lives today. think Madagascar still plague season. logic, saying want walk around shop naked, one right stop me. stay home orders blamed?

How economic social collapse?

Talk missing forest trees. Except, decent number samples people become *reimfected* months. Poor man. He's working ass many people denial. two states border Florida, Georgia's governor hates people even Florida's does, leaves Alabama, exactly known rational decisions either. CNBC says trial results published yet, 8am. I'm honestly flabbergasted they're opening. Sure, Disney likes money LOT. However, go enormous lengths great expense ensure reputation ""Happiest Place Earth"" remains true; risk Disney World getting rebranded ""COVID World"" something horrifyingly short-sighted.  people used entertainment outdoors (hiking, going beach, going parks/zoos/museums), entertainment sitting apartment day fun all. like read, watch tv, play occasional game lockdown, outdoor areas closed extremely depressing. Obviously, worth sacrifice keep others alive, definitely wasn’t enjoyable. Yeah well let’s try rational, like proclaim be. Governors get overrule mayors almost every state. It’s called state sovereignty. Mayors don’t listen governors issue lawful orders (whether agree not) get sued injunction keep mayor issuing illegal orders confusing public. It’s way democracy works. actually lot truth read medical nursing forums.....lots people dying strokes heart attacks home want go hospital.

It’s uncommon patient sick Covid, get better suddenly medically crap bed, go hospital die within day two, Welp, least one guy get chin disease :/ November? We’re seeing dry run Portland July. rushed megamanufactured American one? radical idea - maybe open massive public gatherings worst-hit parts worst-hit country middle global pandemic.

I know, know, crazy even consider, whole thing could fixed going public completely unnecessary activities?

Fuck, might well get repurposed prison guards stuff rented van beat sock full nickels, cause I'm fucking rails. previous poster wrote Trump said U.S. one lowest death rates world. think least order list according ""Deaths per million"" USA place 8 147 countries. say good reason brag. Sure bunch countries poor test lot likely missed deaths, lot tests simply less deaths per million population. mention USA rising case numbers right likely deaths soon increase significantly, too. think especially reason downplay virus right like Trump does. don’t think enough though better many places.

I U.S. going office become stressful me. Province/my office mandatory masking one office wears one, office meeting clients. also meet clients person essential, otherwise telephone zoom. clients wear masks, others don’t. 

In early days coworkers cautious disinfecting, keeping distance, gathering. letting random walk ins in. Since province went Phase II essentially given up. antibacterial wipes spray used even around office regular use “put away”. People work bring groups clients time even necessary meet person. disinfect conference rooms use staff used longer are. coworkers gather breakroom groups fret increased cases wonder rising again, irony lost especially also share family BBQ went weekend. people high risk people live high risk people seems give fuck do.

We “flattened curve” people active cases rising - significant number without known “source”. every confirmed active case based know people socializing imagine least 3-10 infected.

I counting day someone office confirmed case, know almost everyone get it. hope habit wear mask time hide close office door (my vent A/C also blocked - deal sweltering bit), coming necessary washroom breaks on, enough least lessen viral load. never really shut work hole two weeks recently surrounding medical procedure felt far relaxed, unfortunately can’t everyday. Despite increasing evidence spread, long haulers long term complications even survive, think coworkers thing little “over top” wearing mask though like comment many (like 30 cloth masks filters, one half mask PM2.5 filter, bunch disposable blue masks government handed out). don’t care. Almost 40 million Americans poverty (many essential workers, able work, COVID gravy trains) solution able feed ""suck up?"" I'm self centered one? Privilege thats Florida trash. 

nice visit overall people fucking idiots. Water also transmit virus. seen research assume good share pool someone infectious, getting contaminated water nose eyes. vaccine/herd immunity possible guess we'll end passing virus back forth one another, think things would normal. Fortunately seems like extremely unlikely outcome, there's robust evidence emerging like viruses body able successfully clear recovery virus result level protection antibodies cells. Also vaccine development news pretty positive several vaccines moving phase 3. thought went get antibody tests another family member. negative unfortunately. saying thread, bud. people said it, mean get assume fine folks believe it.

You're making person mad at, dont even know arguing with. Take chill pill. Maybe jaded opinion, what? Let people choose. get vaccine protect me, want it, it. others want take chance, well god bless 'em. think they're silly protected silliness. Disney World open right absolutely depraved fucking hate response. always damn choice aint fucking slave. Hell even slaves still fuckn choice dissent. FIRST PLACE - 9 TIMES - COVID NEW OLYMPICS - KISS ASSES, GLORY WEST! country highest GDP, military world influence shithole?

Reddit hilarious sometimes.  Hahaha bs half dollar might start making slight comeback though. work, get roll change deliveries, they’re starting send us boxes half dollars compensate quarter shortage. using couple weeks now. really think lot people going get tested means automatically forced house arrest? Well that’s true all. experts believe many 80% cases show symptoms. spreading misinformation? Remember commercials extra TV bullshit now? :( Wow that’s crazy unions public workers strong powerful. Yeah went kayak nantahala weeks ago went Tennessee could less concerned. weird tourist traps pigeon forge packed. 

Not North Carolina great either big contrast soon cross mountains. Although huge problem Americans (not) wearing masks, Trump get final call decision unless made federal mask mandate, went Georgia route banned mask mandate federally.

In situation look state like separate country. governor mayor matter employ mask mandates cities. No.

There's weekly cycle death count, last time weekly peak higher next week FL early June.

Google collects death stats time. google ""death rate florida covid-19"" historical chart. I’m convinced people don’t give shit families either. It’s lame ass Facebook profile. got worst thing happen entire human race since black death.

Oh please! under-exaggerate. worse permian extinction event. hell Navy going do? care money, also care get sick. healthy means insurance company makes money. want healthy, altruistic reasons.

A Scottish guy called ""The Invisible Hand"".  Alright well hasn’t sued mayor Augusta yet would deserve suing. pisses off. plans spend winter there. Thanks, Florida. Yeah really going enforce one. Fuck dont even blame Disney. blame morons going gets really bad go hospital, facilities get test result hours instead weeks check see really serious not. go week ago cause cough getting worse worse thankfully bad needed admitted. Unfortunately whole lot treatment, keep dieing. Yeah deadlier see people could make way: infections equal deaths. virus mutated deadlier. could known?!? Florida completely blindsided this. I'm drunk pigeon fucking wirh ya fucking relevance SARS-CoV2, even write it? 

I love literally cite one best experts topic come unrelated shit.

Great job there! Gotta proud understanding mutations coronaviruses work comparing flu!

According doctors UK, adults get too. cases ppl 30’s 40’s got MIS. testing back log overwhelmed weeks ago.

US hasn’t cared Canadians think since...ever. imagine likely reaction would along lines additional for-profit hospitals coming address additional health needs, for-profit universities producing doctors staff hospitals, for-profit pharmaceutical companies creating patented drugs treat symptoms. one way address issues overloaded healthcare system, hard see outcome seeks create equality. I'm taking seriously all. Apparenty, US superdense, respects.  saying thread, bud.

It literally said right people can't get ICU bed ICU full Covid patients... etc... okay, die Covid Covid taken local ER/ ICU might still alive.

If someone doesnt get ICU ""Covid's fault"" died.

Just like small town Wherever get hit car, taken hospital, ICU beds ...

.. dont look see got last ICU bed could had. last ICU bed given guy cancer dont blame *that* death. dont say ""Oh less cancer world Insaniac4xc would still alive! Cancer responsible death!""

We say killed making person mad at, dont even know arguing with. Take chill pill.

Not mad all, Duderino. :) ""10,000 cases. that's high meter...""

Three widely distributed species mosquito; Aedes aegypti, Ae. albopictus Culex quinquefasciatus, representing two significant genera arbovirus vectors infect people, tested. demonstrate even extreme conditions, SARS-CoV-2 virus unable replicate mosquitoes therefore cannot transmitted people even unlikely event mosquito fed upon viremic host. anything like postings story, downvotes incoming.... I'm representing ""catastrophic"" all...

I'm pointing something aware thread we're discussing new vaccines affected people terrible ways past. entire point conversation.

And people listing examples too. low amount earning (at least US). would hardly paying taxes earned amount.  Sometimes longer depending circumstances. say personal experience height NJ, coroners likely backlogued unable process everyone. Probably least explored aspect absolutely overwhelmed losing minds folks deal actual deaths. 

And again, circumstances dictate detective get involved, particularly cases person dies alone amidst appears struggle. means take weeks cause death determined and, FL anything like NJ, full autopsy must performed. 

In opinion experience, two months one see accurate results regarding number deaths every state currently experiencing surge. think add 10-20% highest number see place gets 20% highest number cases per day. Florida gets ""only"" 2k new cases per day, take total number corona deaths two weeks that, add 10-20% account deaths taking way longer accurately report.

If wager guess, hope I'm wrong, we're going see close 200k corona related deaths end 2020. Natural selection offer solutions. come nickname Abbot Texas? menstrual brush decided private schools excempt wearing masks altogether real possibility, year year out, US keeps getting decimated virus public refuses get program spend like normally, I'm hoping they'll start exploring economical solution get people back work shopping indoors. 


Admittedly, likely require campaign finance lobbying reform money helluva drug. Hmm average person uses COVID-19 virus illness talking that's there's confusion see. 

But said makes sense scientifically. user

Ah.  US mess. track down? I’d love respond person it. Yes, common one sure. hate sick ideological driven ignorance inflexibility Exactly. 

Then also issue stimulus check - ppl bank accounts large groups gathering lines trying cash checks over. 

It's heart wrenching spite Peruvians trying right thing, much our/Peruvian citizens' hands.

Confusion? Apparently I've suffering COVID since March. think Covid happened hit election year, every decision made government officials weighed politically anything else, including lives country.

I also think mostly US decided take Covid-19 seriously, republicans President wanted downplay scale threat virus.

Now they've seen can't ""wait go away"", they're faced difficult reality, either admit response failure virus large problem going destroy lives livelihoods people charge protecting held accountable or.... continue sweep rug much possible till election jobs ""safe"", think point they'll start admit problems nation face, come whatever fallout time people.

Literally gasping air. Huge health risk. remove rep set wear common areas gym &amp; walking machine machine. Boonies rural areas, boppers probably somewhat similar teeny boppers.

So context rural folk don’t give shit. explain it, increase deaths expected people scared go doc / hospital ""just flu"" free hospital spaces becoming scarce. average arrival time ambulances increased. ""no measures all"" scary part...its like open invite come wipe half town, ain't many anyway Well don’t think Ohio ever worry economy based around tourism regardless taxes. guy said.  horrible, also don’t know many people experience that. might portion hospitalized, don’t know. know ton people get COVID don’t realize it, don’t go hospital. want call point comparison Dane County, WI, anyone get test free, takes minutes waiting, test results returned within 24 hours. need even shorter wait times results going forward, clearly operational level seen many parts US today. Here's idea... STOP TRYING MAKE PEOPLE WORK HOME COME IDIOTIC OFFICE!!!!

Sorry... bit ongoing war group employer. really like we've working home since march productivity every measure gone UP. Everybody happier.  1) it’s current hot spots use quest. Nyc longer test results wait bc increased testing states. pool first location
2) know likely infected. asking symptoms jobs known covid contact get pools ppl aren’t likely infected.
3) let’s say 100 swabs positive test rate 20%. random sampling 5 tests 32.768% chance 5 negative. would 20 groups 5 6 groups negative leading 90 tests 100 swabs thats ding random grouping. wonder true is. Like, really start seeing July 4th effects well August? that's really case there's going inflection point populace realizes trapped completely surrounded data support it. Nicole Galloway (his opponent) certainly pulling lot money right now, vast majority Missouri still red even wealthier suburbs KC STL red-leaning. There's chance winning, I'd still call pretty slim. So, might know (since there's australian news americanized subreddit), Melbourne making masks mandatory, since we're dumb bunch people, everyone fucking panicking, minor brawl pharmacy went to, line 45 people (for small pharmacy). masks available, social distancing.

Australia fucked, we're going end exactly like america, ratio cases. 

Why fuck kids allowed schools use masks? gives flying fuck education go home, kill parents?

This world absolutely retarded, absolutely fucking earth dumb cuntery fucking shitfuck retarded. proud American citizen ashamed country politics govern it. 

I honestly believe way gets fixed new Constitutional measure. series Amendments whole new constitution. That's it. nothing could less patriotic United States standing say ""this working, let's fix it."" That's nice least barrier moving. mind trying learn German moving course. know much learn moving languages strong point. Welp. what? actually goes perfectly friend sells surgical supplies facilities story hospitals barely covid patients ICUs. towing line story hospitals using classification Covid get money federal government insurance companies deep financial holes shutdowns earlier year. abuse classifications make money also this. Two different sides exact story for-profit hospitals. Nope, can’t thread without making America’s problems course proven itself. That's Phase III trials ongoing testing. mean clearly acceptable DeSantis. could easily hit 20k testing 100k day testing. can't make look remotely like disappeared hospitals saturated ICUs people dropping dead streets. lacks infrastructure censor tweets people cell phone cameras, although might try sending secret police intimidate people so, worse... Ok, want use logic people smart phones, cars, internet etc. thousands years didnt die.

I visit family Florida month. like 2-3 months quarantine really good me. 

I quarantine.. meaning go work come home. quarantine. visit rarely leave house. 

I get tested drive there. Unfortunately now, rapid tests come mornings gone 10 AM. scheduled appointments September. like since last week June.

So essentially take day work (where might 1 2 hrs end day) get tested. negative, go see family. positive, knows. 

This new normal family. working home (entirely possible), could them. would nice, guess we’ll see new stimulus keeps people homes.

The first shows many Covid/Flu/Pneumonia deaths occurred since February 1st. Unfortunately, month behind due lag reporting deaths CDC. (For instance Florida reported 5,000 Covid deaths far, link recorded 3,900 today.)

The causes bunched together, bit confusing. subtract column labeled ""Deaths involving Covid-19 pneumonia..."" ""Deaths involving pneumonia without..."". give pneumonia deaths without Covid.

I compare number second link. still apples apples second link shows pneumonia deaths entire year several places. 

Even large discrepancies, see double pneumonia deaths Florida year compared last years. get subtracting 2,013 8,143. compare \~3,000 pneumonia deaths would expect typical full year. Original Poster -- thanks awards y'all! importantly: get word, pass along friends family STILL taking pandemic seriously

That due reason logic, though. doomers. Google friend! driver 98 Cavalier, know older cars pain change wipers on. far right yacking far left silent majority sits home watches NETFLIX afraid go outside. OK, know patients people getting sick?

That means going even dead bodies deal after.

You know really increase survival rate, right?

So say originally getting 100 patients day, 10% die. That's 10 corpses, bad, right?

Now, say next week got 1000 patients day. 10% death rate, that's 100 corpses day.

My flatmate casually walked kitchen told someone office tested positive employees sent home.  


I asked knew tested positive department told thought someone different floor, specific info shared him.  


I've trying math bit. guess company received news morning person infected likely got test done Sunday Monday (it's usually 24 hour turnaround here). would mean person felt ill weekend, went test, got results today. case office last week could've spread point (I believe typically five days sick symptomatic, whole work week pass around, completely sucks). 


I'm hoping ""vacation case"", one morons decides vacation country super essential summer. Czech Republic requires test airport returning certain countries, best case scenario person got back weekend tested positive never contact colleagues. think unlikely, probably office last week felt bad enough weekend want get test yesterday.  


It's huge company, think four floors employees, chance flatmate caught low since said would've known someone worked directly, I'm still bit concerned.  


My question is, concerned person shares flat someone works office someone test positive? see hardly ever stays room mostly, course use bathroom kitchen. 


Some work offices people gotten covid. people spread generally work closely together? cases spreading without direct contact? 

I'll lock room tonight stay friend's vacant apartment tomorrow days see situation unfolds flatmate company. guess key see if: a) flatmate feels ill next days, he'd likely show symptoms Friday; b) company outbreak. mean every employee people contact need stay quarantine?

With 25% positive rate, 0.75\^4 estimate negative test.

It's 31% chance coming back negative 25% individual positivity rate.

So 69% tests would get retested.

2,500 (bulk tests) + 6,900 (individual tests) = 9,400 total tests.

However, since need see results bulk tests first re-testing positive bulk tests individually, can't run tests parallel. turn around time terrible simply ""going take test"" enough prevent going back work. making 1 week, 2 weeks getting back results devastating.

However, less overall tests could mean faster turn around times.

Yeah need science! Excuse throat itches. Cough cough. swallowed squirrel leg wrong way. hot? hot here? trucks. 

Not found, placed. hospital beds, days. would likely penetrate 60% unless surging, point 80% seems likely.

Since reaching herd immunity pretty much means they've lost control, means surging, 80% seems probable scenario. US going reach herd immunity vaccine deployment unless early candidates fail left waiting late 2021 2022 get something, US allows outbreak burn uncontrolled.

But lets play game, end hitting 80% prevalence. scenario, hospital capacity going overwhelmed. know IFR 0.4-0.8% recent healthcare innovations best practices took hold. sure now, let's supremely optimistic say 0.2-0.4%. Guess what, healthcare capacity overwhelmed, 0.2-0.4% IFR irrelevant unable get help. excess cases, IFR closer 2-3x higher original 0.4-0.8%. Lets put around 1.5% IFR getting care need scenario US hits herd immunity sometime 2021.

Lets say 1/2 people 80% scenario 2021 get care need, Americans left overall IFR 0.9%. herd immunity reached sometime 2021. herd immunity reached 2021, even smaller fraction people get hospital care need overall IFR would approach 1.5%.

So 330M people, 80% prevalence, hospitals overwhelmed 100%, means 2.4M deaths end outbreak 2021. estimate excludes non-COVID-19 related deaths due overburdened healthcare system. Seems appropriate tack indirect deaths due COVID-19 outbreak.

\---

In reality, US limp back forth lockdowns, likely cycling around 200k deaths (counted uncounted) every 3-4 months another 3 cycles least. think 800k deaths seems like fair estimate make point, unless Americans needs done actually quash outbreak contact tracing levels... something tells many would rather 800k die, rather directly indirectly financially inconvenienced. one wants lose job elected government going try everything help them, willing shoulder additional financial burdens help fellow citizens.

If batch 4 tests together means person 25% test. positivity rate 28%, means every single batch 4 tests come back positive. gets jack shit. You’d drop “batch testing” two people. even getting close 50% positivity rates.

I feel like general discussion homelessness covers anyone loses income thus home.

It's weird want say, ""No, listening me. Landlords going homeless, too.""

And far anti-science goes, anti-vaxxers well represented Democratic party. wait till vaccine refuse participate. 2008 caused housing bubble bursting obviously housing market took huge hit.

Again, possible buy companies overseas. needed approval transaction, especially capital exceeds certain limit. oversight also grant CCP ultimate control company.

However, one really knows exactly happens that's up. am. local hospital testing facilities. it, he’ll use hookers. earth country allowing US citizens come US in? bonkers within Italy. Southern Italy cases talking herd immunity ridiculous way. No, bad person, hope overcome issues. Hopefully still talk online friends.

I'm also big yank go majority activities people clamoring about. get appeal things, can't understand overwhelming desire people things. hang watch tv read books stuff without leaving house. There's much entertain without leaving house. really bizarre people incapable so.  saying reopening school? wage caution. agreed too. 

Quit bullshit please we’ve going circles I'll see economy 'rona plays next couple days NYC never really closed construction either. one dumbest parts not-quite-shutdown phase.  Covid testing free everywhere. know people needed get tested pay couple hundred dollars get tested since free testing sites any. One friend told cost $300+

Absolutely ridiculous bet trying get covid vaccine amongst panic going absolutely bonkers truly empathetic instead selfish.

/u/40PcMcNuggWSowce literally said 'Congratulations'.

Tfw unlock total organ failure early   There’s alternate reality North Carolina didn’t elect Democratic Governor got shape Texas boy thought doesn’t make wanna vote...  exactly fear have. I’d definitely feel better vaccine certain countries EU also approved it. rate thing go years don’t treatments. People won’t care happens someone know even it’s severe emboldened take lightly. “I’m gonna it, I’ll turn car around summer vacation!” 

Seriously, guy FUCKING JOKE. real, legitimate shut back massive clusterfuck become! Idk (got symptoms) neither got it. Made everything - wearing mask (in public transport one protects others also me), Social distance hard, washed hands on. (try Test today) think got shopping. Thats thing makes sense. 

Don worry atm feels like bad cold self quarantine got tested.  good, market second third companies release respective vaccine. great first lockdown- flattened shit curve. 

What screwed us people didnt actually follow reopening guidelines. People took reopening mean “back normal” instead “ok THINGS get back *some* activities economic opening up, things make safe”

If dont want lockdowns, need follow instructions safely reopening. Instead shitdicks like jake paul threw massive house parties. Start buying stocks 🙂 He's himself. Game changer... country burden sick explosive costs care. citizen US assume rich powerful better means survive justifying ol ol us plebs. Good countries though. god stupidity... see ""porcine"" reference sourced. Usually see drug name parentheses, take mean generic name. people it? breaking paralysis knowing like bystander effect. many us trying spread word simple things we're actively resisted. much without force, even go far Hey, still owe us one time burned Whitehouse. Shh protests spreading virus ,dont watch news,going protest offers plus 100 virus protection,no mask distancing required/s ok, thanks info! American didn’t quarantine came back Nova Scotia PEI. clear weeks, PEI clear months, American guy like “quarantine boring, I’m going go meet people.” cheated win. I'd hardly call elected official. like corrupt tyrant. Pretty sure psychology experts classified scientifically narcissist even elected. think see recent actions also sociopath. 'getting off' hurting country. 

He empathy. Even empathy family likely frames terms himself. Likes kids carry legacy. Likes wife makes look good/desirable.

So summary... explanation he's narcissistic sociopath. think there's enough evidence go there.  tendency believe fringe cases properly studied constitute norm.

150k lot ""fringe"" ... Source? Two coworkers affair. took advantage lockdown use office liaisons, doubt telling respective spouses reboot computer wanted work office, dual monitors. got caught, though, someone legitimately needed go office. fact check saying “out context” they’re saying anymore. point say people heard listened it. 

And science didn’t “evolve.” That’s nonsense. We’ve always known masks reduce transmission respiratory viruses. couple months Corona hit, walked ER cough, box masks waiting you. 

Masks work. always worked. guys knew lied. seen everything point China seems better place go us, actually cheap healthcare?

People wanting immigrate us looks thing past. sure hell would want go there, breaking leg means lifelong debt Georgia straight next level voter suppression. said all. Speaking of, anyone else forgetting characters books pandemic keep freaking taking precautions? started reading *The Stand* pandemic finished lockdown, even characters need socially distance. simultaneously refusing vaccinate children. never remotely implied everyone US gets shot. chance killed firearm literally 28 times lower country US.

Also, shot life somewhere (on public land), lived US, there's anecdata you.

Finally, non native speaker, I'd like point ""you're"", ""your"". Ебло сука какой же ты тупой. Как ты можешь срать на свою же страну и блять не по делу . Ты хоть знаешь историю вакцинации в России? У нас культура прививок и вакцин начала развиваться ещё в РИ,причём одна из первых стран с обязательной вакцинацией,а ты ебанат им про БАДы и аптеки.  Also massive riots protests could helped to. say summer, he? Full metal genius right guess. Considering money already gone keep us alive, im thinking going free fiddy average Joe. mean flag? better literally grooming stool Every subject law uk otherwise they'll get executed ole Liz look still bow None them. 

Also weird people obsessed 14th century plague killed perhaps third Europeans 16th 17th century plagues swept Americas killed 80-90 percent indigenous population. 

It's clear multiple novel diseases multiple vectors far dangerous single communicable outbreak. thought seen all! Better killed black money look weird? 

Or actually competent president? reason thought Newsom already shut us down. What’s still open SoCal? county closed everything except, like outdoor dining stay it’s shaping outside+ distance = OK. testing 5Pee network leader say?? Lets stop testing disappear!! hope make god forsaken land late that’s kind go back original comment. government provide financial assistance. data currently shows can’t confidently say we’ll avoid doomsday scenario without shutdown. there’s chance 2-10 million Americans die. also believe economic fallout shutdown worse potentially (again, still statistically significant chance possibility despite ***feel***) 2-10 million Americans dying + economic fallout deaths? 🎵In navy

Requested test may exposed work Drs appt morning.

24 hrs later told stay home 14 days positive Ok.......???? knew -- I've looking graphs keep looking back \~3 weeks. realizing really need look back \~5 weeks.

So like anything resulting 4th July festivities may show (as deaths) mid August guess. 

Though hospitalization would probably (but data easy monitor.) European here. 

Personally sad many lovely people US get thrown idiots banned. Lol think tyrant YOU. states intercept steal karma doesn’t suggest 2.4% hospitalised, Active include people hospital longer are. lol case point. long beach.. lol kids I'm really intrigued idea forest schools. child like time there? think pros cons children attend them? (If feel like writing it.) done research, idea forest schools could instill reverence nature younger generations lost due modern life, could great way build connection hopefully raise new generation people invested protecting environment :) never really thought realize pretty obvious issue feels like somebody's job think contingency happened. know who, somebody. man essentially committing genocide. needs CHARGED accordingly. lived America wouldn’t praying right like 4 step process open back could barely get step 1 everyone jumped straight step 4. 

It’s like paid attention orientation. unfortunate contributed much making necessary, certainly hypocritical heart protests weeks often unmasked massive packed crowds people regard speaking outrageous risk public health contracted Covid-19 “no idea” exposed, subsequently showed understanding remorse many, many people directly indirectly put risk.

In summary, wear mask stay home. people actually right March, nonsense would done months ago.

It’s unwashed white MAGA goons news driving unchecked spread virus data shows clear dramatic disproportionate effect Latino Black communities regards infection rates especially regards outcomes. It’s certainly part socioeconomic, it’s also result choices based evidence, evidence news Red-Hat-Wearing jerks cause virus spread. people know tend conservative every single one without exception wearing masks staying home since day 1 quarantines, many before. Pretending like it’s “the guys” disingenuous outright dangerous vulnerable groups hope protect. like Titanic, poor people majority casualties, can't get off. Healthcare reserved afford job. Life happens people without job US pray get seriously sick fuck life financially Healthcare. ya

Are D4? like convergent evolution slang China sneezed US caught Pneumonia. Interesting! I’ve literally never heard phrase before. also ***MARCH 2*** proper PPE supplies (which issue time), learned contagious is...

FFS, learn something.. ***4 Months!*** He’s really dumb. things thought would save economy. way save economy stop disease. obvious beginning anyone two brain cells, Trump none. yes, posts criticising president removed, that's hardly find reddit California actually dropping cases reopen protests subsequent reopenings happened. now...  client’s child sneezed set early March. Positive positives ""friends false idol people worship instead focusing what's important, eventually bringing disaster upon themselves.

Based Jewish/Muslim/Christian religious myth. really dislike approach of: ""I can't earn X it'll worse tax wise"" France quite like thresholds too, anything 75k EUR think starts get quite expensive... I’m starting see outright teacher hatred online teachers don’t want go back work actually care themselves, kids, community. people like, “these privileged teachers need get asses back work, like doctors nurses did!” No, win game piss shit pants. *LMAO's hospital support*

Nobody gives shit staff make back front office functionality possible, members staff remember exist something breaks, usually talk shit us.

We even bad non-medical staff. Maintenance workers, cleaners, catering staff - know, people *make fucking hospital building stand keeps staff functioning*, completely forgotten about. There's someone claiming radiologist saying ""We low ranking get"" ignorance displays astounding. Americans allowed travel ireland still im pretty sure they're supposed self-isolating two weeks isnt enforced. bit fear mongering going justified. Schools also tend start earlier summer go later late spring-early summer did; mention worst states point places random showers common (FL) and/or dangerously hot next months (TX, AZ, CA \[Southern\]).

In cases kids even allowed eat (under limited shared coverings) PE, recess outside heat/air-quality several days per year; periods less 45 minutes, entire school day.

Trading COVID heat stroke/heat exhaustion still risk transmission bathrooms after-school indoor contact, etc. attractive solution.

The US population also 200M people lot growth areas would seen nearly much development (deserts) without social technological changes toward indoor activity/services/temperature controls. also increasingly urbanized, schools thousand attendees. 

It scalable idea suitable substantial number schools/districts/regions. Later year, unsuitability moves northward changes heat risk freeze risk. I've Long Beach twice. Nice area. Found American :). 

Pretty sure I'll get free small fee. again, I'm Swiss. It’s much personal risk drunk driving. Incredible.


But remember work travel industry stories colleagues come mind.


So many people think either sneaky, everyone else dumb idiot....it’s really astonishing stories hear. say 15% isn’t crazy? UK spends 2% GDP defence, France 1.8% astonishing stupidity least half humanity... idea survived long. They'll reap sow. Plus even new infections stopped completely given point time, community would still suffer weeks come, incubation period.

So seeing real extent disaster yet.

And (as layman) honestly clue purpose public testing everyone tries accomplish anyway. society cannot track infection chains anymore, everywhere like USA, public testing takes ressources away those, need test profession severe cases. Although later diagnosed means, picture lungs such. may recommend communist paradise China inclined live boot authoritarian government keep shut room...

Portland's also nice time year.  Belgium lets keep initial 30K without taxes? so, that's ridiculous imo, pretty fantastic. Switzerland, pay taxes even live far subsistence minimum. earn 1500 month (2500 considered absolute bare minimum survive), pay taxes. Hell, even poor supported social services - earn 1500 roughly 2500 get social services yourself, pay taxes. ridiculous.

(Less situation US, still.) people say cali people never california therefore element donny Pancreatitis nasty. 10yrs ago. Sounds like got lucky disacharged 3 days. know caused it? Depends live. Asia, get hospitalized often even symptoms. keeps community.

In Europe, even breathing difficulties may enough. rather stay home hospitalize really bad. means risk dying home getting sick drugs effective anymore.

The general rule breathing difficulties severity. closed back March, WAKE FUCK UP! made covid-19 testing free, likelihood vaccine free too.

Oh sweet summer child... Well like steerage voted lock deck Well shit might make sense. Tomorrow mark day 14 NY. Seven since Wuhan, 4 since US realized already here, 3 1/4 months sign light, 5 1/2 months possible leadership national level USA. wonder would trump say american scientists leading race Massachusetts republican governor fine thank much! want us.

Karen's kick stink wearing mask min grab bottle milk, makes anyone thing people would ever get vaccinated? yes, Covid. Nose swab tests race. Also happened two racers 2019 covid. would personally put “safety efficacy trials” within realm “external input” whatever. mind already made use debating circles.

I’m sure many Reddit also discount promising Moderna vaccine it’s created drug-maker based US 🙄 Safeish. really low infection numbers rising long time, despite relaxation rules. death rate actually still going down. pre-pandemic life. People wearing masks indoors (mostly, seem think nose breathing), absolutely mass events like concerts parades supposed keep distance 1,5 meters wherever possible. fairly large city, we've like 10 new infections yesterday. That's risk live seeing friends small groups going restaurants. I'm usually eating outdoors, I'm disinfecting hands lot wear mask whenever I'm near people. do. rare cases vaccines adverse events. deadly desease circulating population far outweighs risk vaccinated. There's lot information website: evidence vaccines cause autism. research started rumour fully discredited: favorite US couple sued Norwegian traveling agency advertising seeing midnight sun Norway. upset sun US. That's point, social media media posting videos pictures. individuals, nothing. think ever will. put pee pee PPE. university establishing utility pooled testing detect community spread. They're essentially assessing useful pooled testing would rather individual testing used time.

This addition federal go ahead pooled testing given clearly shows wrong belief article shows use pooled testing US. Meanwhile Islamic nations... drug companies produce cheap. idea years raise prices. live also idea statement means aside context clues, worry.  always wondered. cops pigs/bacon Canada well? Canadian bacon? rookie numbers. Ask trump win! moderna bullshit imo.

quite lot higher ups sold shares. we’ve come (expletive) mask.”*

I know, right? lengths people go avoid wearing mask... think crowd would particularly keen get vaccinated something that's hoax. strains effective against? living game Plague Inc, know Trump office. OP, instacart doordash me, 70% alcohol sprays know. last three years lot young adults die cardiac arrest race training. almost enver happened before. taxes pay mom’s treatment. taxes pay military. pay life. pay death.

Registry stopped sending employees help facilities it’s going quickly get hand here. It’s honestly terrifying. places going become understaffed time need help get. least give employees extra $3 hour hazard pay. Source. Haven’t seen yet. Production started months ago several vaccines still clinical trials.

They producing spec one approved, enough supply. ones arent approved get thrown away. 

Huge risk production funded grants, e.g Bill Gates' foundation. Illegal immigrants! give up. Keep mitigate risk keep family safe. Cheers Alabama. Volcano. Nice touch! Happy cake day, btw!  Lemme guess, Republicans? great news continue hospitals full. hopefully news like lead people less careful.  prepared. ready enjoy optimal conditions. stressed tested relationship. Double-double Tabarnak.  Lemme guess, Republicans? lawyer, definitely win court case nothing American exceptionalism. It’s big country. US overlaid EU adjusted population density: countries EU doesn’t mean speak differences let alone ones never went to. Go Alabama NYC tell they’re different. 

There parts country barely populated parts people packed like sardines. point treating whole country it’s doesn’t work. dont understand someone anti-science... left Texas fuckwad governor Greg Abbott.  Yes, reason count cases. still infect others. It’s pandemic virus, involves personal risk. small rural towns ones biggest problem covid breakout resources big hospital care get sick need advanced care. places people's best bet hobby-farm self sufficient needing stuff stores often. Declare terrorist group course. Ssssshhhhhhh sub hates good news vaccine isn’t cure. People continue get sick die. That’s misconception. vaccine isn’t guarantee won’t get sick. 

This far even vaccine appears fall. Plus worry rushed vaccine hope there’s side effects something. Yup :( That's government wants think. 30 grand did, wife's doctor. start, could try googling 'gender dysphoria', renamed less offensive 'gender identity disorder', RACGP good resource. could perhaps open mind learn subject deserves hell lot tact displaying.

Or go ahead keep waving pitchfork. Wow. middle school went to. know hits close home. RIP. Huh Communist dictatorships excellent leadership models. sub give California Newsom shit? rates worse Florida NY there's never peep Ummm .. proof fevered imaginings? Maybe people actually making drug one respected universities UK? mean Americans want it, that's cool us.  Good Lord. learned First Aid course can't call ambulance point specific person tell call ambulance. shout ""someone call ambulance!"" chances nobody it. Yea know dumb/ignorant old people are, they're probably still blaming 5G Obama spreading Corona Well, bunch New Yorkers go Florida vacation lockdown rules New York. NY biggest disgrace amongst states coronavirus containment plan Damn read this, realise stupid Corona fan boys Ebola cost lower - hoping scaled round 6-8k making viable U.S would suck US get vaccine first, get clear, get back normal, 6 months later travelers countries got vaccine yet show things explode immunity worn off. *🎵comin’ save motherfuckin’ day yeah!🎵* friend whose divorce started getting going february, iirc...maybe january...but, regardless- state went lockdown, things got...uncomfortable home. 

and friend wants/plans convert r/vandwellers lifestyle, hit road...possibly within week. i'm convinced best course action, point pandemic, nationwide...even though state one ones fairly well.

also- plan land remote i.t. job, work road(currently out-of-work). i'm sure realistic plan is, considering bound lots people chasing fewer jobs, industry- really know.

any thoughts possibilities..? RULE BRITANNIA! BRITANNIA RULE WAVES! literally insisting rest us die identity crisis im canada ex gf stayed abroad two three extra weeks roomate SC afraid allowed back home convinced hop another country subvert travel ban.

yall dense fucks. best regards ✌️ assume paid? Uyghur people amongst radicalised islamic terrorists actively planned carried terrorist attack China past.

That course say Uyghur terrorists, also legimate problem.

Here's one famous incident triggered government's heavy handed Interesting. That's decades old conspiracy theory. People saying Gates since 80's. They're already tracking population via cell phones us keep hand daily. doubt right point Trump calling fake news he's one gets announce it. Yeah managed sbux like 15 years I’ve always impressed !!! totally wanted steal employees there. picking bad arguments, articulating poorly.

you played yourself, gg. right, they're working towards good country, they're moving towards goals capably. equating placing value ""good country"" intelligence. wrong, different value system (and I, record) have.

you address points. american lives straw men, saying politicians dumb straw man.

more confederate politicians would like going reelected. making money right anyway, cases matter. Let's differentiate US/UK rest world. taking account vaccines already mass-produced assumption might pass phase 3 get emergency approvals? 

US/UK vaccines population end 2020 makes sense end 2021. brain cannot comprehend logistics delivering rest world outside US/UK, end 2021 probably makes ""a commitment provide 400 million end 2020,"" according 300 million potential vaccines already pledged US 100 million UK, BBC said. clinical trials prove vaccine works, first doses could ready original goal hopes could change peoples mind facebook. Took week realize happening. Yes, lessons learned draw from. Must fake news libtards, temporary morgues New York.  Backlog hiding numbers 'They'? I've (now fix) got 1 president apiece good bad column far empathy. show unbiased opinion, hell got? Lol turn blind eye whatever want see, know reason people generally agree opinions along party lines abandoned ability think themselves. Otherwise get far larger mix ideas, far centrists currently have. ABSOLUTELY right. Nothing fear, sending 4 kids school, thank /s prisoners commit crimes victims institutionalized racism poverty, fixed you. said, prison systems U.S. China horrible. Kinda late isn’t going make things worse happens twice it'll damage consumer confidence. People worried third fourth time. think vaccine worked UK 'rushed' fucking Trump? Lmao dude, step US bubble all? Governor Pete Ricketts (NE) lifesaving measures too! also ignore fact letting pandemic ran rampant also cause (very possibly worse) economic damage.

It's ""saving lives vs saving economy"", ""save lives fully reopen economy sooner vs letting people die ultimately worse economic damage"". number idiots decided vaccine dangerous refusing suspect anyone wants one able get one fairly quickly. don’t understand communist censorship works. work hospital hundreds Covid patients. Antibodies testing essential staff, including work Covid floors, 12% positive. 

Unfortunately think herd immunity long way off.  We're sick fuking self-centered assholes spreading disease us. Fuk fuk restaurant work drive through, it’s tough I’m proud reputation hold. took awhile masks protective measures take hold cases deaths climbed March. Hopefully Texas gets worse people start realize need protect themselves. death figure quite high weekend reporting practices. long time reported nothing Sunday Monday mornings. roommate/cousin says thing.

I assume came Joe Rogan repeats ideas. know man intubated 57 days. know high schooler home 104° fever struggling. know friend's relative who's intubated going make night. Shame Dewine ordering masks ordering schools go remote. I'm terrified what's come Ohio. Maybe paywall contributing information deficit. They've licensed load countries, believe. Russia deal, apparently, well countries. 

Honestly, Oxford crack expect Cummings/Johnson hail strong Britain outside EU. FML. expect Johnson bounce back polls.  I'm scheduled go back campus month. ugh... Key word **reported**. white house wanted numbers routed them. corruption. latest GINI data China World Bank 2016. I'm sure would found GINI data 2019, abut likely may looking data consulting firm rather official body. understand people disagreeing facts population density high here. weird thing disagree with. Like guy obviously talking people dense. SC complete shit show little distancing masks worn. Free tracker!? pretty expensive. I’m down. I'd assume would priority vaccinate vulnerable first.

So, essential workers, elderly people, children.

In terms production capacity look much produced vs. many people vaccinated.

The current claim 40 million doses vaccine able produced new facility built end year.

Combine existing capacity think entire population (Hopefully even antivaxxers law) vaccinated first couple months 2021. 


Or could take China approach start injecting prototype vaccine military anyone else. vulnerable UV light. Eric Weinstein suggests could mean covid-19 developed lab escaped.

There literally 0 link two statements. UV light deadly many viruses / bacteria lab otherwise used sterilisation years. you’re anywhere world universal healthcare, probably December January 2021.

If you’re American, lol. I'll wrecking ball comes want see place fuking destroyed One study said people response adaptive immune system basically always got worse. Another said biggest outbreak centers places multiple highly differentiated strains virus circulating (due international travel probably).

Basically, people strong antibody response. stronger antibody response - maybe - worse outcome. virus antibodies spread body defeat it.

In understandings ADE, virus similar somewhat different antibodies it, ADE occur. get infected one strain COVID-19 also second strain time present community.

Even T-cell immunity, occur first days infection there's T-cell immunity. body fights two strains, make things worse. happen much flu highly infectious COVID, think happen degree wtih flu well.

So that's one danger letting virus run rampant community. Keisha Bottoms goodbye! locals Tahoe irritated people live Marin SF coming up. got email Vail Resorts Heavenly Northstar come visit mountain summer I’m staying Bay Area it’s safe again. people’s feelings price tea China?

Science facts say thorough shut down, social distancing, masks contact tracing way beat virus. decisive shut down, temporary governmental financial support, allows best outcomes health based financial based.

Feeling haven’t entered conversation you’re paid you’re worth economy two different numbers. Well, people jump window lose business fine then, right?

But really mean ""I rather *other* people dying lose business"". terrible. kid gets coronavirus Disney flies back homestate. Children largely exempt mask requirements less likely slowed virus.

The problem bars anyone dumb enough go one days probably less likely take virus seriously could become super spreader. vaccine good chunk developing world childhood immunizations.

What makes anyone think 3rd world countries get vaccine? TIMELINE: First indication efficacy would likely come June Data studies expected August September.

The original july projection based studies done UK enough people got infected corona.

Its hard test vacine people don' tget sick promised welcome breakthrough mutual understanding China US coronavirus crisis, Fang Fang’s diary quickly translated published May English title Wuhan Diary: Dispatches Quarantined City. striking aspect book quotidian events, public reactions, emotional problems Wuhan vividly described Fang Fang resonated struggles average Americans experiencing time. Appearing did, height Covid-19 epidemic US, diary could instructive first-hand account, events paralleled hardships facing American population months. Yet book received scant press coverage, reception overall media lukewarm. Conditions already improved Wuhan, dramatic news narrative China’s struggle disease begun fade mainstream news feeds.

 

**Asymmetry quality popular media discourse**

Another aspect asymmetry political media discourse two countries quality commentary. Much political commentary appears US media carried highly opinionated articulate media celebrities, nevertheless academic professional qualifications. Squeezed exigencies 24/7 news cycle, US broadcast news programming tends give high-profile politicians pundits disproportionate amount airtime discussing US-China issues, rather prominent China experts academia major think tanks. contrast, Chinese state media, relatively indifferent ratings profits, tends populate commentary shows dry university professors experts rather charismatic talking heads polemical public figures. carefully controlled programs invariably present carefully vetted state propaganda, least tend authoritative historically grounded. dealing issues don’t directly pertain Chinese politics, often substantive comprehensive US equivalents.

One outlet Guancha News (Guanchazhe wang) (Guancha News 2020a), hosts ongoing series commentaries political science professors prestigious universities various geopolitical historical topics. One popular widely distributed programs China (Chinese title: “Zhe jiu shi Zhongguo,” “This China”), prominently features Zhang Weiwei, International Relations professor Fudan University author numerous ultra-nationalist books China’s rise (Guancha News 2020b). months China’s epidemic situation began stabilize, Zhang put series videos documenting contrasting approaches China US dealing Covid-19 crisis. commentaries dealt differences political structures, health care systems, media influences, even cultural differences, China’s supposed collectivist mentality vs. individualism US society. upshot presentations: American system experiencing failure governance, due corruption economic inequality, whereas Chinese model showing increasing resilience adaptability due centralized, scientific governance, focus material well-being average citizen. 

 



[*Zhang Weiwei, Fudan University (center) professor Cai Yuyang, Shanghai Jiaotong University, discuss “China America’s war Covid-19” Guancha News TV program Zhe jiushi Zhongguo, “This 

The mass media system Xi Jinping created truly commanding, programs effective shaping cementing CCPs narratives. (For Xi Jinping centralized consolidated China media system, see Moser, 2019.) TV radio outlets national, provincial municipal levels throughout country, week state disseminates hundreds hours political news analysis. cumulative effect programming, however biased may be, average viewers absorbing state propaganda, process also receiving amounts informal minicourses comparative history, political theory, governance systems. result, safe say educated populace China much better understanding American political system average American Chinese system. living Beijing election Trump 2016, struck ordinary Chinese people, even Beijing taxi drivers, would ask cogent questions aspects American system, US electoral college importance swing states. daresay average Americans could even provide basic description Chinese political structure, much less pose intelligent questions leadership succession. 

 

**Insights Americans Chinese social media**

If American society somehow directly exposed Chinese popular media social media, kinds insights increased cultural awareness might result? following points view Americans might find enlightening.

*The Chinese view American response Covid-19 vindication China governance model.*

The disastrous Covid-19 response US reinforced notion, pushed Chinese Communist Party, China model proving viable, many ways superior American model. beginning coronavirus outbreak, China Global Television Network (CGTN) promoting notion China’s governance model, focus centralization collectivism, better suited Western democratic systems address public crises pandemic. Trump administration failed flattening curve epidemic resulting drastic resurgence cases June 2020, China state media reported events air self-congratulation, outright schadenfreude.

 

*The Chinese shocked Americans’ seemingly cavalier attitude toward death rate.*

Time time Chinese social media narrative sprung ‘China everything keep death count low. US everything keep GDP high.’ Indeed, one common reactions among netizens PRC. expressions genuine shock dismay United States, bastion ‘human rights,’ could callous high death rates. Especially inconceivable Chinese netizens offhand comments US video clips effect ‘The coronavirus mainly kills older people anyway.’ steeped China’s Confucianist social tradition respect elderly paramount, sentiments quite jolting.

 

*The Chinese chided American resistance medical science advice experts.* 

From beginning, Chinese netizens experts expressed surprise large number Americans simply take advice health experts seriously, particularly regard wearing face masks. wearing masks common China elsewhere Asia recent decades response high pollution levels major cities pandemics. Thus, switch facemasks obvious intuitively acceptable average citizens. first half year Chinese citizenry inundated information mandates health safety. inconceivable Americans would indifferent, ignorant, scientific facts epidemic. Lol! ok. gonna offer help like $5 overdue library book something. GL stuff :) Worldometer 15k lower arcgis Florida today. aren’t cooking books, they’ve burned thrown window. lines? Saw video crazy Disney lady line jungle cruise person front mask holding drink. live streaming people asking mask replied she’s enjoying drink wasn’t even consuming time. Confiscate boats expel back US. Thank kind words.
I really feel teachers. knew one day they'd considered ungrateful underpaid daycare workers. 
It's sad come this.

Keep family safe. washington. im fairly sure theres 0% chance anything essential businesses open august 1st. im guessing lockdown august, sept, october, slow reopen november elections holidays result digital Internet revolution China Chinese citizens afforded front row seat domestic debates culture wars. Information-savvy Chinese studied history, politics language, also, virtual sense, spent time lecture halls living rooms, overhearing conversations, listening arguments, observing think rest world. all, means Chinese spent much time listening Americans talk Americans China. countless hours hearing presidents, politicians, academics, talk show hosts, news commentators public figures talking country, average culturally aware Chinese person reasonably good grasp range opinions US. contrast, Americans general know little China’s history culture, spent virtually time exploring China’s media world. inevitable result Americans tend know scarcely anything China, even less Chinese think America.

 

**The asymmetry Covid-19 crisis**

In late December news Covid-19 began emerge China, China-US relations already strained breaking point. President Trump midst waging protracted trade war surrounded China ‘dragon slayers’ Peter Navarro, Michael Pillsbury John Bolton. US State Department issued string criticisms China human rights abuses, internment million Uighurs ‘reeducation camps’ Xinjiang province. much talk US China locked ‘Thucydides Trap,’ term ‘decoupling’ already buzzword mainstream press.

The animosity two countries exacerbated anti-China rhetoric streaming freely Chinese cyberspace. first months 2020, China’s Covid-19 epidemic gradually subdued US began see infection rates peak, China’s information environment awash videos media clips countries, particularly United States. addition official news China’s highly centralized network official state TV Internet news outlets, China’s social media also flooded tsunami video text information. Video clips foreign news sources China’s handling epidemic reposted hundreds millions times day, due enormous reach combined social media platforms Sina’s Weibo (497 million users), Tencent’s WeChat (1.15 billion users) Bytedance’s AI-powered news entertainment aggregator Toutiao (200 million users) (IH Digital 2020).

Sampling enormous amount information sites provided Chinese netizens panoramic overview foreign discourse concerning virus. constantly updated stream clips videos taken directly American media outlets (with Chinese subtitles often accompanied blogger commentary) allowed Chinese social media users listen America’s fractious domestic political commentary talk show debates. scrolled Toutiao’s infinite ribbon media clips, found could follow Trump’s daily Covid-19 task force press briefings, watch comedians Stephen Colbert Trevor Noah skewer president rambling statements constant gaffes. wide spectrum opinion, speculation, information misinformation user’s fingertips. quick succession, Chinese netizens could sample sane sober comments Kevin Rudd, former Australian Prime Minister, China hand fluent Mandarin speaker, scroll downwards hear wild coronavirus conspiracy theories conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh.

Given mix reasoned analysis vociferous China bashing, usually latter garnered attention online. March 2, 2020 Fox News aired segment “The Five” show, wherein following exchange took place:

 Watters (co-host Five): ask Chinese formal apology. coronavirus originated China, heard one word Chinese, simple ‘I'm sorry’ would do. [I’m] demanding formal apology Chinese Perino (co-host Five): outbreak started didn’t start here, Dana, I’ll tell started China. ‘Cause markets they’re eating raw bats snakes…They hungry people. Chinese communist government cannot feed people. desperate, food uncooked, unsafe. scientists believe that’s originated from.

 

The next day video clip, captions Chinese, already going viral China’s social media (Shao 2020). following day Zhao Lijian, spokesperson China’s Foreign Ministry, called Watter’s remarks “ridiculous” “laughable,” (You 2020). Outraged social media comments speculated whether remarks represented opinions US government rogue opinions irresponsible talking head. sort media event, common weeks, reflection information asymmetry question. offhand crass remark American infotainment show capable triggering diplomatic squabble attracted attention Chinese Foreign Ministry. potentially inflammatory anti-American remarks also heard Chinese media, offending comments seldom picked American news outlets never find way social media environment. Chinese highly attuned American invective directed them; American media largely oblivious Chinese vitriol spewed direction. 

 



[*Videoclip Fox News host Jesse Watters demanding apology Chinese people Covid-19, claiming Chinese people “eat raw bats snakes.” clip went viral Chinese social 

But inflammatory language American television shows amplified Chinese media space. February 3, Wall Street Journal published editorial critical China’s handling coronavirus outbreak, title ‘China Real Sick Man Asia,’ (Stevenson 2020). sobriquet ‘sick man Asia’ (Yazhou bingfu) derogatory coinage turn-of-the-century Qing Dynasty, intended denigrate China’s perceived weakness passivity face foreign aggression territorial encroachment. term came wider awareness among American public Bruce Lee, 1972 film Fist Fury, shouts group Japanese martial arts attackers ‘We Chinese sick man East Asia!’ (Yau 2020). term long perceived Chinese Chinese-Americans racist trope evoking China’s colonial history, use Wall Street Journal moment geopolitical raw nerves bafflingly tone deaf.

The use offending phrase quickly spread throughout Chinese state media social media, triggering popular outrage. Reaction part Chinese diplomatic corps immediate; Chinese demanded apology editorial full retraction. Wall Street Journal repeatedly refused accede government’s demands, China’s Foreign Ministry expelled three top journalists newspaper’s Beijing bureau February 18. Ironically, three expelled journalists, deputy bureau chief Josh Chin reporters Philip Wen Chao Deng, seasoned China hands way responsible editorial itself, doubt would first advise use sensitive term consulted.

These three journalists 2020’s first victims retributive tit-for-tat. March 2, US State Department announced punitive move reduce number Chinese working US China state media 100 workers, thus resulting expulsion 60 employees five state media outlets. ill-advised US move gave Chinese government perfect excuse expel several top American journalists active reporting Chinese handling coronavirus outbreak. March 17, China kicked experienced China reporters Washington Post, Wall Street Journal New York Times, forced firing Chinese nationals working Voice America CNN (Smith 2020). Given need more, less, information coming China, reflexive retaliatory moves two governments counterproductive regrettable. 

Indeed, American reporting time lacked accounts inside China, especially coverage going inside city Wuhan lockdown. Foreign reporters allowed city, difficult garner information interviews average citizens. award-winning Chinese novelist named Wang Fang, writes pen name Fang Fang, living city Wuhan lockdown occurred. January 25, began keep diary daily life city quarantine, publishing entries Weibo account, 3.8 million followers. Fang Fang wrote facts daily life, food supplies, mental health, sleep problems, staying touch friends. also frankly critical many official policies procedures, diary entries often censored posted them. diary provided daily catharsis many, began gain notoriety China. Weibo account suspended February later reinstated (Davidson 2020). I'd care elderly aka boomers get first along rich. likely given kids last everyone center. So... remains meaningless me. essential continue exposed shit without aid. He’s type person follows instincts guts without thinking behind it, maybe they’ve right sometimes gotten results it’s sustainable imo it’s broken clock right twice day type thing. That’s opinion anyway. That's interesting. I've heard similar things years, know name, like ""bystander effect"". remember hearing documentary 9/11 people often freeze emergency crisis situation, takes one person let one good scream move everyone else action. Makes wonder we're naturally like this, way we've conditioned. provided transcript. think yourself..... Fearful Asymmetry: Covid-19 America’s Information Deficit China

Abstract: longstanding fundamental asymmetry level mutual understanding US China. Chinese citizens avid consumers American media cultural products, whereas Americans woefully unfamiliar even basics Chinese history culture. asymmetry resulted situation US danger misinterpreting misunderstanding Chinese motivations bilateral relations, particularly times crisis. paper recounts Covid-19 epidemic 2020 exacerbated existing tensions US China, escalations state-to-state conflict large part due America’s information deficit PRC.

 

 

**Introduction**

There longstanding fundamental asymmetry level mutual understanding US China. John Holden, seasoned China hand formerly National Committee US-China Relations (NCUSCR), characterized difference following way: problem Americans understanding China lack information; usual channels information tightly controlled, much country governance seems opaque mysterious. Chinese analysts US faced opposite problem; overabundance information US society, politics government difficulty sorting making sense cacophony (J. Holden, personal communication, 1998).

Holden made observations expansion Internet access China, despite information explosion brought digital revolution, fundamental asymmetry two countries remains. true academies think tanks China US, also common among average citizens countries. Across classes demographics groups, Chinese know us know them. problem, US-China relationship, vital global economy security, spiraling increasingly heated episodes misunderstanding conflict. international Covid-19 crisis exacerbated existing bilateral tensions, many result longstanding unresolved historical cultural schisms. seems clear many recent diplomatic cross-cultural missteps part US due lack knowledge Chinese culture history part political leadership, American media public large. stable productive bilateral relationship requires contact compromise levels, deeper understanding – though necessarily agreement – side’s position. often sticking points relationship due basic asymmetry information flow: lack adequate understanding them, whereas often know us well.

 

**Possible sources asymmetry**

There several overlapping reasons asymmetry, structural, cultural, historical. preeminence world economy soft power influence, US outsized presence world discourse. China, countries, acclimate American style global engagement, absorb American cultural norms order fit US-dominated world order. Since China’s reform period 1980s, Chinese people avid consumers American popular media students American way life. digital explosion late 1990s saw massive influx bootleg DVDs CD-ROMs country, exposing generations young Chinese people Hollywood films US TV programs. rapid growth Chinese Internet 2000s resulted even greater influx news, entertainment information US sources, price computers digital devices fell, average Chinese consumer easy access great deal mainstream media output American produced.

It well known China’s Internet blocks many foreign websites, much American media inaccessible within PRC. Yet, despite massive Internet censorship, China’s Great Firewall actually somewhat porous. Censorship circumvention programs Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), technically illegal, still obtained young Internet-savvy Chinese, affording many millions people access blocked sites US elsewhere. example, media platform Twitter, blocked China, said company 10 million active users within China (Ng 2016). addition, Chinese Internet many “leaks” allow restricted information flow within system, cutting pasting blocked material, attaching files email attachments, converting webpages digital photo documents, informal sharing digital files via USB drives.

Another source informational asymmetry sheer number Chinese nationals students residing US work study. 2019 statistics put number Chinese students US studying undergraduate graduate degrees 370,000, number increases yearly (Statista 2019). Chinese students US source tremendous amount information insight America informally communicated parents friends via email, telephone social media, particularly ubiquitous Chinese communications app, WeChat. sheer amount quotidian messaging incalculable, means many average Chinese steady stream first-hand accounts American society culture. Meanwhile number American students China pales comparison. jump number China-bound US students around 2008 Olympics, total declined 11,000 2017-18 school year, insignificant fraction number Chinese students US schools (Feng 2020).

English education China, countries, required part basic education. Since Deng Xiaoping’s Reform Opening period, China made English integral part college entrance exams, number people studying English estimated 300 million, nearly population United States (Tan 2015). result enormous number educated people able directly surf English websites, read English books, view English-language film video media original language, without aid translation. Many young people good English skills actually enjoy adding Chinese subtitles American films TV shows distributing translations online, thus increasing number fellow citizens able understand appreciate English-language media. 

By contrast, relatively small number Americans learning Chinese either secondary tertiary level, due relative late start students have, seldom reach levels listening comprehension fluency Mandarin counterparts China attain English. Thus, hundreds millions Chinese access English language information directly, far fewer Americans, even Chinese ability, able view absorb Chinese media, surf Chinese websites, read Chinese news feeds.

There also differences media control systems China US impact extent informational asymmetry. Chinese film television varied rich world media terms entertainment products, news political programming tightly controlled. actually wide spectrum political orientation China, full scope public opinion fully represented due censorship. Chinese equivalent heated left-right political dialogues town halls American television. Chinese politicians public figures argue policy public, politics general excluded non-news programming; is, fact, strict separation entertainment news. interested American netizen, state affairs effectively masks true state ideological diversity within PRC obscures full picture pluralism exists country.

US media, contrast, fully corporatized, profit driven, ratings focused, resulting media environment infotainment norm. News shows produced entertainment, entertainment shows regularly showcase politics. (Note main staple late-night TV comedians’ monologues usually satirical attacks president.) Whereas politics public policy Chinese media treated didactic sober manner, US politics played blood sport. Again, challenge interested Chinese observers American scene make coherent sense rowdy chaotic oversupply information. good know. getting bit depressed.... know everything alright, feel whole lot better. Might even go drink tonight celebrate. Capital Hill 10 years ago awesome, it’s residential high rises now. Uighurs probably want land back all. 

Tibetans too, seem violence. Means end world thought. Can't believe Trump said that. We're fucked. We're saved! lol. we're not. Perfect. need people smart enough take it. Yay! Guns everyone then. Lazy? *not* becoming police state triggering every mask hating guru like guy here. Shoot virus! bizarre; Republican's MO impression reading previous articles they're producing massive quantities already assumption vaccine prove successful, they'll two billion doses ready go around September.

I read there's sites produce vaccine around world. particular there's factory India, apparently, specifically working doses go developing countries. gives hope low cost distribution model everyone.

I'm curious see countries distribute vaccine. know China using unproven vaccines military, hedging bets. US try prioritize essential workers keep society running, medical workers, emergency workers, grocery store workers risk? like early days testing saw entire sports teams get tested average citizen get test? Alright thank you. vaccine ready Sept 300 million units.

Everyone gets vaccinated.

Is over? go back normal life? hospitals give numbers feds information available public. 

I smell corruption. He's governor. charge Ohio National Guard lol. Godless coven insanity PRIDE. Remember pride, arrogant pieces shit smearing perversion community. cure you.  Yep, mean, main focus vaccinating risk groups, high vectors spread, like doctors, nurses, teachers maybe.

Forgot meat packing workers. highest risk environment anyone working freezer/cooler day recirculating airflow.

Common sense would doctors/nurses, teachers, old folks homes, high risk critical jobs, children, going workforce based criticality ability company effective social distancing. get critical stuff, move eveyone else model. problem trump, politicians rich people get first. care vaccinating doctors, nurses, teachers, old people, children. widely distributed end 2020

lol 2 countries widely distributed. Albeit fair ones West need managed completely fail contain virus. good would anyway, it’s pandemic

I'm following? people would like return semblance normalcy (and stop sheltered-in). mean ""what good would vaccines do, pandemic""?

The idea individuals like could get vaccinated, rest easier knowing better chances ending hospital COVID-19 infection. Yes, even middle pandemic. uhaul prices jacked oddly enough Id like know month month comparisons deaths (total, covid) us state compared last 5 years. We’re undercounting covid deaths would reveal much, news articles quoted cdc nih confirming much don’t reveal actual 2019 2020 provisional numbers far could find easily anyway. 2018, 2017 past easy bring up. Due to*  Wow Canadian want know really empathetic situation good folks going on. We'll least ones trying best minimize this... rest think get someone love gets sick passes. right really sad part this. Eh. I'll really trust bleu states read states figure massage data sync President.

But honestly, trust anecdotal data (such diagnosis). may give us ballpark figure are, there's precision. standards diagnosis reporting different states hospitals, solid data comb total death count per month. Anything short highly circumstantial.

EDIT: repost obvious grammatical errors get around filter. Kinda silly I'm directly addressing topic, understand moderating board probably Sisyphisean sometimes. land Everglades, somewhere. stop diminishing it. Three elderly people comorbidities excellent chance needing serious medical intervention. baby gate desk kitten stepped power strip disconnected computer work. still goes router occasionally longer distracted throwing piece crumpled paper him. crumpled post notes furniture  Damn read prison later lol... 

Totally agree tho Dick Cheney still thrives. world backwards. needed close whole fucking time, stupid fucking headline, close already people dying inconsiderate fucking morons. Lol! job would send straight home. reason we're wearing masks Governor mandated I'm waiting boss tell can't wear n95 surgical looks intimidating patients. week governor Murphy mandated masks back March, Boss sent memo stating going start sending people home wearing masks. bought blue light glasses I'm wearing face shield. I'd lose job came work face shield let alone swimming goggles. I'm sole provider family right need health insurance. need worker protections employers like mine. assume that, would need see paycheck rather news ticker.

When make assumptions point system based level agreement superiors Uighurs deductions restrict level movement. make assumptions people segregated live on-site housing based ethnicity. Thats kind assume they're probably free they're probably paid well, knows since seem care state live easily move around, maybe state holds onto money now, too? would want believe that? really hope so. Doesn’t 300m doses 10 weeks sound suspiciously overconfident? 

Even started production tomorrow, logistics producing, packaging, transporting 300m doses would insane. took us 10 weeks get national toilet paper shortage, despite infrastructure place. Hey fellow Arlingtonite!!!! Thanks compliments. think referring 2 puppies handful awesome. kind words paintings always welcome big thanks there.

You family stay safe well. *Frick*

Good point can't give boosters? not?  honest would change? We're basically almost completely locked now. Didn’t stop teachers West Virginia. won! demented treason-pig would sell tickets Jesus’ crucifixion. money-worshipping, Godless, worthless meat-bag is. Ya, know mean. I'm guessing, though, lot people going start experiencing anxiety first time. Ah yes, noted real news source BBC, 11 days ago, quotes experts estimating mid-2021. No, can't see us finding workaround this. I've heard cases reinfection, seen anything suggest norm. Even were, knowledge virus, deal growing, even immunity would figure way minimize risk. bought Moderna. Moderna needs hurry up. FB - Plandemic video? Serious question, 2 different vaccines (say Oxford moderna) got both, would make things worse better? instantly relaxed imagining post. cant fucking wait  mean they're wrong seven day averages cases deaths down, testing capacity obviously problem. Prolonging infection like done harm economy we'd shutdown month March/April. Lack leadership federal level. Yep. Everything else said thread fluff, realized comments too...I'm sensing lot fear behind machismo dismissive attacks going sub lately, make sense. I'm going upvote empathetic comments 🤐 Exactly. wait staff want wear mask could well no-win situation. least governor Arkansas isn’t denying use masks  people like spread stuff? craziest thing ... hell would want go US right now? 

It's like thinking whether want go Congo vacation Ebola outbreak. I’m Florida, unfortunately. don’t see way stay open do. one school 3 sick employees right now, one passed away morning...and there’s 15 people working summer. not?

And using appeal authority wrong. one's claiming authority something they're talking something else. actually hits nail head.
I came across comment went along : ""If teachers giving students, might well fuck die. Plenty happy take jobs."" jaw dropped.

Wrong many levels. lack morals. logic. it. think I’m loop here. that? 

A Llama lead around sponge bob?

I thinking like this. well shi# haha  one next party standing line. obvious markings ground throughout queue, indicating stand. There’s lot distance marker. move next market party front moved. part queue switches back next another part, Disney put large barriers make sure one gets near anyone else. 

While rides, they’re filling seats rows make sure party gets near another party. 

They’ve even propped open trash cans longer touch open them. 

They new utensil dispensers longer require pressing button. 

When park, guide fill every spot, least beginning day. 

Stores designated entrances exits now, people don’t pass way out.

I wouldn’t go feels weird open, damn Disney isn’t taking safety seriously. people self-regulate gets bad. stockholm closed nothing estimate even 10% infected Yup. There’s lot conservative grandmas adore family values. denial like 3-4 days January. One look initial medical journals knew shit going bad. yah she'll fine. tell drink water thinks fine. older people never drink enough water tell drink thinks, end drinking much should. Burying major bullshit multiple layers little talking points people parrot pretty suave terms manipulating populace. nearly every facet country fighting Americans something. claim he's genius, he's idiot internet paints be. gets results, even fucked immoral. person epidemes! Great answer. preliminary vaccines already entering mass production. Considering current trial 10,000 participants think numbers scale outside realm possibility, especially given billions thrown it. Let’s forget horrors rushing vaccines like Swine Flu vaccine. There’s billions dollars made that’s never good thing people remember order extra places stack bodies every flu season?   goalposts golfcarts thank you! keep thinking literally help product arms 20 min breathing it, touch bag use groceries... even let see it. So... HCL hoping do, also helps avoid COVID strokes lung clotting.
+1, Humans. Yes...that'll teach us... hat man. Damn. us.

Nope! even try that. small minority people, COVID rates would high. majority Americans taking seriously. New studies coming even survive virus, could lifelong ramifications. Remember novel virus don’t know long term effects about. vary, based I’ve read, general rule probably 10 14 days. symptomatic cases specifically article says 10 days symptoms resolve. asymptomatic cases generally don’t develop symptoms 10 days testing positive, you’re contagious anymore. 

[my expert way, I’ve said based article linked, I’d recommend go CDC website website, official source want know more. Despite controversy around CDC WHO, especially early mistakes, they’re still reliable they’re true experts. Repost tweet pics people know went spread word shit serious. Yup shit truly hits fan affects people personally. results economy based around tourism, leads governor able close anything whole economic model flawed.

Who could ever seen coming? another great argument. lmao use Google next time. like, browser/app spell check  Link Masks enforced Washington while. working. Arkansas dislikes government mandates even Washington does. First off, cringe asking source nowadays, quickly spend 7 seconds googling.

Second look data, lists deaths ""in nursing home deaths"" something worded similar. course exact numbers nursing homes died coronavirus staying hospital, common estimate 11-12000 new york.  talking about? France role model covid response.

You think U.S. bad? France higher covid deaths per capita U.S. France 6th highest covid deaths per capita, U.S. 7th. comes masks, France even worse U.S. (U.S. 63% mask rate vs France troubling part whole story people still going Tim Hortons Waiting school’s reopening plan big fear. Parents send kids sick damn time. kid last year—twice—once walking pneumonia strep. Colleagues too. way police supposed isolating/who exposed. remember months back heard would vaccine ready November really told friends (face face) virus would long gone then.. Hmm.... wish studies read lasting effects immunity get play fun alligators! fair all. loss - hopefully someone step plate take place. speech codes passed context sweeping campus concerns racism, sexism, homophobia. Freedom thought regarding important matters relegated second- class citizenship face moral emergency. 1987 law student spoke early 1990s said something recall day. “It like strong storm swept horizon,” remarked. “Suddenly afraid speak honestly sensitive subjects legal social pressures.”

“Her educational reigns included genuine virtues, policies helped pioneer regarding intellectual freedom sports another matter. must forget ever-growing campus sensitivity diversity bureaucracies helped put ever-renewable steroids. lesson is: distrust resist calls censorship, regardless source end. duly wary ambition conceptions University institution reach beyond intellectual criteria.” video consists multiple reports Chinese state medias, likely different factories.  Even million people die covid that’s approx 0.3% (0.003) US population. drop bucket likely effect SS.  They've nearly caught number cases NY yet 15% number deaths. mostly tourists something going back home die? see going different way. think vaccines cheap readily available HUGE debate people vaccinate not. like mask debate now, probably times 100. love smart people, wish one them. people concerned death rate. Personally, think physically crippled workforce long term effects kills economy. proven effective safe, readily available average person obtain **at cost** government mandating order people allowed return work attend school. conditions need met anywhere mandated. nowhere near 45%. I'd honestly shocked even whole percent people refused vaccine due conspiracy theory crap, there's really many antivaxxers, they're vocal minority. 

It's also easy someone refuse vaccine measles know anyone died it, lot harder thousands dying every day covid deny vaccine that. Pretty sure strikes throughout history ""illegal"". comes point law ass morally obliged break it.

Every teacher *must* refuse accept vulnerable students expendable. teachers striking much, every teacher country, even vast majority? solidarity unbeatable. But... 

***MONEY*** wear mask indoors outside table take sitting eat. state figured out. rest idiots still indoor dining shit case numbers 40x higher Tractor Supply policy CDC best practices, requiring Team Members wear looked morning went there. interacted two team members go cash register, tell want ring someone takes car. (That procedure nothing pandemic. could always big bulk items like horse bedding.) cashier guy loaded bags car wore 6 foot tall standing fans 

I want one big fans badly, can't afford spend much fan. three foot one $250. said family assume wedding dozens even hundreds people coming together? 

That's great big hell me. undertone ""forced"" labor.

But guess enough evidence yet say title. barely imagine it. damn embarrassing American. Well get 4 months from? started open up, numbers haven’t gone up. exactly getting at? Wow. pissed Cheerios?? Nah unfortunately time soon predict, they're high risk job starting send back public, meeting clients, etc. Oh I'm another hot spot state there's too. 😔 Great time open schools! /s Teacher strikes illegal West Virginia, comes loss licensure there’s definitely significant difference. strike would require vote teachers union, opposed work stoppage much loosely organized I'm glad hear feeling relief, crying every night anymore. Man, gotta frustrating watch states poorly, others better. Like, can't everyone get onboard obviously works? know, easier said done. frustrating. Joe Rogan edgy teenager never really grew up. People fall ""enlightened stoner/DMT great"" act, he's really another rich guy can't relate average person.

I find podcasts interesting can't take seriously based viewpoints.  Cities tend vote democrat islands seas red.  umm, takeout? know places still allowed indoor dining? never said would bad thing part world vaccinated soon possible, I’m questioning proposed timetable don’t want people build false hopes expectations. Florida never really closed either. usually wait wind make disappear, highly ineffective strategy yard looks like shit. production issue, need distribution well. there's one thing humanity taught us, even simple meagre tasks become political. Vast majority people get end fine. Doesn’t make serious, hopefully helps calm bit getting numbers per day takes 10 days get results back?  DeSantis + hypocrite parents = Florida outbreak. He'll try unjustifiably take credit like giant asshole is, yes. world going give credit, lol.

Except maybe Red Hat people. think pushed 2021 first time.

It's probably still technically likely one catches virus specific event (especially force masks). worth risk completely optional event happy celebration?  use 3 shifts hospital 🙄 lump us fucking Martian. thought we've always told probably need shut least another time. People getting really creative anti mask thing. Mask up! COVID DEATH RATE GOING HURR DURR DURR!! fucking hate shithole state. Gay pay. Ah see redditor culture well haha. PhD? worries shut flattened curve Australia. eased restrictions opened shops. large outbreaks Melbourne gone back lock least 6 weeks. east coast getting breaks New South Wales. I’m Queensland waiting hit again. seems end sight. blame people wearing masks whoever charge virus doesn’t seem care. worry people cope going lockdown end sight.  300 30? double belief DANGEROUS MORONIC SYCOPHANT ""74% ""Experts"" say fucked""

Hey, let's go Disney World!! Depending availability beginning next year, best case scenario wasn’t south, California looked like April LA County *this* close maybe taking thing seriously. would rubbed nose smacked upside head newspaper. favorite response anything ever Yeah, says tastes like Hannity's ass. understanding flu virus poorer job surviving hot weather, case coronavirus degree. I'm expert either. throwing guess flu that. think something points, though: people stuck inside together, getting fresh air sunlight like normally do, could weaken immune systems expose other's germs happening warmer months. Someone upset visa got denied. :( can't believe already 7 months... Semantic difference  Hi New Zealand, mate wedding fall end dates lock cancel main day postpone till safer governments reopening plan gatherings 10, first week new rules. sorry hear special day caught crap Thus far data pointing direction outdoors masked one least likely ways going get Coronavirus. Contact tracing well anecdotal evidence points this. Even indoors short periods time social distanced masked relatively safe, note 2 hairstylists working together sound carriers worked 100 ppl's hair, parties masked up, client received virus. 
 One high risk situations indoors without mask engaging high volume close conversation, shouting, singing etc . . . words activities sending respiratory fluids air absorbed others. 
Contact tracing showing people traced back outdoor protests majority people masked up. 
Contact tracing finding TONS people giving bars, restaurants, indoor gatherings people masked up. know right would love blame protests civil Injustice data coming showing accurate.

 Anecdotally, neighbor mines twenty-something daughter go LA kind premiere, indoors unmasked, came home prior symptomatic went 4th July boating trip 20 family members fave half them. one gives fuck wedding Governments smart? Gotta send kids school labor pipeline. people refuse wear masks claim virus bull? doubt travel bans matter them. death statistic new york shows 6-7000 died nursing homes instead accurate 11-12000 actually died

Source? think protocols fact tracked vaccines appropriate safety precautions.

This fast track isn’t really cutting corners nearly much it’s much concurrently possible, vaccine trials cut front line every step process. 

For (an oversimplified) example, usually drug vaccines finishes phase 1, compile data end, give regulatory agency, wait agency review it, get approval, submit design phase 2, wait regulatory agency review design, get approval, recruit participants phase 2, run phase 2 trial.

With fast tracks, cut lot wait times try things time. first phase ongoing, data collected reviewed real time. Regulators figuratively embedded research team soon data collected validate approve it. Meanwhile, don’t wait phase 1 successful designing getting approval phase 2. soon phase 1 wrapped signed off, phase 2 take off. 

In normal world, would take many resources part regulators would require much risk part drug producers operate like this. vaccine, governments financing lot risk dedicating regulatory resources see through.

I think good analogy would DMV:

Normally someone goes get license wait line talk clerk, get form fill out. fill form, wait another line turn in. turn in, wait test administrator come conduct driving test. it’s turn, go prove they’re safe knowledgable driver. come back wait line get picture taken. Two weeks later, get license mail.

From safety standpoint, thing really matters actual driving test. someone safe knowledgeable driver, see tests.

So fast track would equivalent going DMV cutting straight front line. Instead filling form, clerk walks car asks questions, time get car test paperwork taken care of; meanwhile, snap picture start printing license assumption you’ll pass. still driver test everyone else meet threshold pass, waiting form filling cut out. soon pass test head back park, instructor already calling clerk license ready. soon pull in, license handed you. goes Fyre 2. Drat.  Make America Banned Again. Plague rats world. Hell job orange! Laughs European? Nah.. pity schadenfreude quite now. Hope don’t fuck vaccine; best! Almost everybody Boise wears masks, least indoors.  There's lot California imports find conservative utopia expected make lot noise. rural dimwits neighboring areas. rally capital building last week - maybe 10 people showed up.  better worse, Boise closer Portland days Florida Missouri. 

I know Idahoan, I'm supposed stay quiet great Boise beautiful state whole is.  I'm starting question approach more.  people believe Idaho flat boring conservative, people come tend boring conservative. Sorry loss 😞 Blah, post paywall-links? PCR takes 3 hours. I'm sure wife got test back 1.5 hours. Right (in Texas) we're working two week backlog. insane. confirm test took CVS Dallas took 16 days come back, completely pointless post become political mask wearing guess. idea downvotes here's upvote. would great immunity lasts, far doesn’t seem that’s case. Nah, till early 2021.  (US)Do u guys think vaccine free possibly cheap? Well 400 healthcare workers died. alone 2400 years schooling average 6 years each. deaths also little skewed towards healthcare workers caring Covid patients well. sure lot grocery store workers, lots education. think whole thing mostly affecting older people *now* really want take chances see many people killed lot time could used make economy money? 

But also, lives lost sad. economy biggest focus. Tragic. 'We go feel terrible defects make unable use vaccines honestly don’t care enough anymore happily go get one first day finally leave house. Well, IndiaTVtimes certainly top-tier new source, so... add downvote.

But arn't that. elderly homes literally wiped face planet enough residents die close up. People still even wearing masks they're supposed to. guarantee vaccine even possible. like thought would vaccine aids 4 years Regan president never panned out.

American culture anti-mask wearing ""freedoms"". Observe meeting Utah days ago lose complete faith country. long State enforce face mask police, we'll never get Pandemic, Thank Republicans: enjoy freedom die Corona virus get kids grandma bunch strangers sick perceived slights freedoms. 

Look screwed Utah cause bad anti-mask culture. literally never going get corona virus rate, travel States bring pandemic cause legal way keep out. America's Heartland also Heartland Corona Freedom: freedom get infected stupid mask neighbor die. bad live schools aren’t even planning physically open least next year. really dont want play division irl... face bullet spongy. Utah well Lol. I'll hopping there's vaccine. Well, pay taxes, seems much efficient running health care several private companies. Copay free Spain, drugs close free prescribed doctor. regular antibiotics course 5 usd. happens there's safety net people.  Finally James Harden go strip clubs think that’s part it, also aren’t many younger people dying younger people tested found positive. good. people we’ll finding long-term effects since they’re dying, though. That's interesting perspective. stole, think punished ""acceptable"" given mental health condition? point people responsible actions?

Not trying stir anything interesting think 2am  People understand affects personally. convincing otherwise. Hi, coming UK here, right say.

The spread virus, say, control virus' spread EVERYBODY'S fault/responsibility

Here, clear 'lockdown' means still work together keep way.

Blaming counter productive way go, understand fears frustration.

C'mon America? Start working bit more, get thru fucking horror show. ❤️ Ain’t fucking job worth it. Life way mysterious us realize. Blah blah blah. babies catch spread virus, well YEAH. angers hear stuff like this. wish yall best :( time recall happening first time Florida hit 15k new cases - also Sunday. know somethings wrong country people can’t even understand value human life GDP. US morally necrotic core. It’s incredibly frustrating it’s hard what’s right. followed lockdown, wore masks, avoided crowded areas months, could much less scary now. there’s end sight. It’s made lose faith fellow man well government (though wasn’t strong begin one). can’t wait day leave US permanently. work think many positive asymptotic people. .84% today looks like took common cold added genetic marker covid. way get immune response like normal vaccine fight covid instead.

Will interesting. everything right, didn't. city, county, state opened way quickly. Thanks! test Quest Diagnostics we'll see long takes. said 5-7 days. guess one love ones die covid, catch it.  Bet wished wearing mask pepper sprayed him, lol.  mutating cold. serious disease colossal threat humanity moment. understand freedom choice think pertains situation antisocial behaviors. is, people right choose something endangers others. People can't choose drive wrong side road without facing legal consequences. example, safety others far greater importance individual choice. I'm trying start argument, stating stand issue. try remember lot corruption government even academia, people fields legitimately trying good. Point being, government faceless machine. thousands people trying complicated job routinely must balance interests rights people govern. question Sweden's handling virus

We \*definitely\* reading sub.  Unfortunately fast-tracked vaccines likely 90%+ effective lifespan longer 6 months. like crutch (hopefully) get substantial portion population working/researching/learning in-person at-risk demographic continues take precautions virus research progresses. Like people still going social distance, wear masks, avoid crowded areas, etc. even people get vaccinated. good news since managed get multiple decent vaccines set distributed multiple lifesaving drugs reduce death rate matter 6 months since start virus, made twice much progress time next year 18 months research belt. Vaccines empirically proven last least 2+ years maximum effectiveness ticket towards relaxing social distancing PPE use(though hope wearing masks suspect sick becomes normal thing). What's frustrating Garcetti accept ounce responsibility opening way quickly. blames state county. one forced open schedule. Plenty blame go around here, enough accountability. ghouls pointing fingers one another. that. hospitals capacity death rate shoot longer treat critical condition. course not, Europe know normal, we're shocked many stories like coming there. ""Florida man"" great example collection. ""on brink"" needing another lockdown, ALREADY need another lockdown. 48 hours results BC, Canada.  fair him, he’s grown well white suburban family I'm relieved part, people province taking things seriously, even four months various levels lockdown. population 15 million, we're seeing 100-150 new cases per day, even though ~10 daily deaths still many, look States see horrifying situation *could* been. sad see far US fallen four years, world leader cautionary tale. many testing 100% negative? Australian, I'm horrified see happening States.

I'm surprised people rioting streets poorly disease managed.

You're going end truly tragic deathtoll time over... Florida Man see's shadow, it'll six weeks Coronavirus vaccine you

Next! Indian government saying produce billions vaccine year produce hopefully “For every lie tell, truth incurs debt. eventually, debt paid.” like Titanic, steerage locked deck. I'm florida, first test (I've tested 5 times now...) took 14 days get results for. living sister family time due apartment fire required stay quarantined 14 days. results negative...  People died waiting results come back. glad like Chicago. got tested, got results back 3 days. Problem lots teachers paid like trash US. choice, work risk classroom full plague rats called children. clicked health page it’s lead “Treat dengue, chikungunya yoga, pranayam home remedies Swami Ramdev”. wouldn’t trust science news. Wear fuckin mask. Thank federal government worse nothing, Donnie's zealots stupid enough turn fighting virus political issue everything stop people actually ending virus keep support. 

Our federal government intentionally taking actions know kill many citizens possible. ***Our federal government choosing go way kill many citizens possible.*** numbers they’re reporting results ten days ago. Sometimes it’s said “there X number new cases today” say “X number new cases reported today”. wording confusing they’re counting tests however many days ago testing done.  Darwin, thing... think people know Xi media attention. could probably find maybe like 1 10000 non-academics know China’s govt actually works Coron-a-Lago Running hospital expensive af. People who’ve spent 20 years lives become profession expect paid lot. Medical manufacturers money hungry charging extreme prices stuff like beds. building huge needs ton different items different sections. It’s easy hate hospitals, they’re part problem. simple things didn’t cost much (in medical world), stuff would much cheaper. Coronavirus: ""Hold mask watch this.""  likely complicit DHS “We’re number one,” never true. No. rest us really care trash memes. So, know average life worth $8 Million, government leaders can't even agree wearing $5 $10 mask.  politicized ""so complicated"", would much easier get people behind containment procedures.  99 know Xi unrealistic. 99 100 actually know name, would probably say that. like imitating Sweden without health infrastructure help god fuckers spread back New York. stupid fucking states Target drive order today literally saw Target employee stroll store, past mandatory masks sign, wearing one. waiting saw several customers walking put mask inches away entrance.

Not sure fearless people came hope keep energy catch covid rush pack hospitals. selfish, stupid thing anyone (especially TX) move around like nothing happening. 

And stop talking freedom! Thinking wearing mask infringement freedom makes look like even bigger idiot/loser! neighbors 3 kids western New York moving Fort Myers end week neighbor soon headed FSU incoming freshman. bite tongue time see even though really want ask wtf thinking. **A)** government money. Say would pay family least $3000 USD, let's say 120 million different people would pay, would amount $360,000,000,000 360 **BILLION** dollars, **ONE** month.

**B)** think even possible COVID-19 reach 10 million deaths worldwide. think final number deaths around 1.3 million WORLDWIDE, USA, 300 thousand. heard ago Samoan / Pac Islander community Long Beach, California getting hard hit. wondering why. said, certain [unavoidable] risks life. Getting sick wearing masks opening schools early totally avoidable. sit next someone without mask conversation, heat going shit.

This [article household transmission new study, fear transmission household members realistic, says Yang Yang, PhD, associate professor biostatistics University Florida, led research evaluate commonly patients transmit COVID-19 close team estimates 19% people household COVID-19 patient, nearly 1 5, expect develop infection. estimated 14% close contacts household see patient regularly also develop infection themselves, Yang says.

If *live together* someone Covid positive, 19% getting it. close friends, drops 14%.

I wonder chance transmission single conversation someone outside? quoted someone me, spell financial. 

Maybe he’ll get Roger Stone write it. can’t imagine garbage would happen actually produced healthcare bill. It’d probably written comic sans. depends efficacy number needed herd immunity. might matter end. Whenever start feel numb, try remember States, huge number deaths tantamount murder part several pachyderm-related politicians, anger freshens automatically.  cant wait go back normal life.. dense?? Galveston one largest ports world. It’s reason Houston largest city Texas. Hate guy, water actually wet....    Less 1% death rate though. Worst case scenario get permanent breathing issues still alive. People coming vacation NJ New York etc duh Hello fellow Canuck! 75m syringes alcohol wipes order delivered later Oct 31, ordered. hunch they're awaiting Phase III completion buying. 75m doses hard fill.   Run 8900 Jan-June year 100% agree you. arguing types people, don’t *believe* long term health effects. don’t *believe* economic fallout happening regardless, *believe* happening due first lockdown. 

Although may look facts morals, there’s massive chunk American population choose facts want look at.

What say someone says “there aren’t long-term health effects”? really great news whole world. vaccine come market September every patient saved countries also save pandemic. Considering situation regarding racism, healthcare, paid time-off job security, I’d say yeah, terrible place live.

The part life would loved spend America college, soon comes working life would wanted get fuck there. animal instincts country surprises everyday Thx assume many are.

And vaccine effective, cares? won't. 

Let choose keep spreading virus among other. think fitting fate? Teachers going working hard provide quality instruction students fall. teachers matter you, support local public school generally, make sure undermine efforts, individually (their efforts provide quality instruction best can) financially (per district attendance that).

&amp;#x200B;

I work high-income district, prevalent undertone floating around community. community money, school one least funded state. already laid several teachers due budgetary concerns, we're still best make sure give high-quality education classrooms normal circumstances translates online learning. someone pushing hard make good experience possible fall, years building community trust respect, kind activity really demoralizing us, despite understanding parent perspective (I preschooler, whose preschool shut good result pandemic--nowhere send bummer.... I'm writing preschool curriculum also rewriting curriculum three different high school courses teach normally class, online). 

&amp;#x200B;

Just perspective consider decision-making. Nothing felt worse seeing community's parents discussing would pay teachers planned lure away district pods, maybe half hourly normally, want 'too expensive' parents. benefits, protection risk, mention breach contracts district. And, price barely exceeds many pay high school kids-as-babysitters area. insulting, given time, training, education, experience bring curriculum-builders provide narrative perspectives, assessment, analysis assessment, modification differentiation, etc. Teaching simply knowing subject-matter (even that's big part it), even giving subject-matter; lot pieces make us effective skills take years years develop.  Florida stupid. Desantis joke. America ever become smart country? always dumb ones friend group? beginning whole thing already hospital oxygen mend results came back. May rest peace. orders contigent Phase III trials. look promising. time find make sand glow. surely thief would delighted chance wear mask

I wear mask drive run red light cameras due mistiming yellows, say look like me. took 15 minutes get results Wisconsin. united states declared ~~genocide~~ citizens, federal government process increasing corona body count much possible people start figuring intentional fighting back. know herd immunity work, tested infected Europe bad news is, hardly make anti bodies, mild cases majority. So, thought would great solution weird virus works ways 😬  I’m going tell telling friends family midst planning weddings: don’t selfish asshole. Tell fiancé eat crow he/she can’t accept it. Lives line. mention convincing anti-vaxxers many Americans take vaccine that's gone entire year Phase 3, meaning know long term effects long imparts immunity. sizable portion US UK vaccinate reason.

Now, amount vaccinated people good, expect medical workers elderly ones getting vaccines first months. Maybe teachers. Maybe. sometimes save comments like hit ""I told so"" weeks months later, funny thing, half time, accounts deleted. Remindme! 15 days  course haven't. likely agréments place AstraZeneca, Moderna Pfizer pending passes Phase III first. syringes part order now, have. logical. want say ""thank you"" affordable healthcare finical 

Can even fathom amount fuckery trumps healthcare bill? going pass executive order like Obama way going pass vote Congress. Personally I'm glad said we'd see within two weeks think funny. post removed cannot verify reliable source. Twitter sources may reliable. possible, please re-submit link reliable source (i.e. news article).

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* reinfection highly anecdotal point. 

either way even 3 month window majority vaccinated immunity virus die spread enough stay ""relevant."" happens treat spot fires arise nothing like catastrophe right r/LeopardsAteMyFace Funny one talking 1,100 labs Florida testing 100% positive cases. best comment Nah, US Trump insist signature vial, like stimulus checks. HK tough citizens, love Americans (see US flag flying around?). thus, enforcement American expats/tourists lax. US goes nuclear, HK will, course, affected. also constant interruptions. Daddy, I'm hungry. Daddy, juice. Daddy, want play Rush? Daddy, clogged toilet.

It's hard concentrate work mind getting obliterated concerns. guy really said stupid pee public Trump probably could declared national emergency restricted selling N95 critical PPE general public preserve medical personnel not.    
US WW2 restricted sorts things made companies produce war materials paid it.   
There’s plenty blame go around.  Starting top. That’s full blown definition “dictatorship”. Always wondered, moved Florida 20 years ago, would person now, would airborne stupidity changed insufferable moron.  needs happen, won’t, consistent leadership across board citizens willing part. doesn’t open, close, open, close. could open, appropriate precautions, without closing. people won’t follow recommendations they’re selfish, leaders across country can’t page...in fact encouraged make choices without provided accurate info experts. 

There numerous ways situation could allowed safety economy exist far past point now. two answers that. I’m saying right, I’d like know think them.

First all, economic fallout 2 million death (which best case scenario considering we’re 150k lockdown)? impact weakened workforce survivors long term effects virus? happens lose doctors, teachers, on? happens dual-income families one parents died? happens worst case scenario (I don’t believe many people would die, current numbers make possibility) 10+ million Americans die? economy isn’t necessarily safe stay open let people die. 

Second, don’t believe economy crash stay locked down. What’s stopping government providing monthly stimulus checks save millions lives? idiot suggested going magically disappear. said March. two weeks ago. again, what, two days? 
Leave cult. Rejoin reality. go away believe it. Obviously move dining outside one wear mask. took 2 Vegas vast majority people orb masking, washing &amp; distancing pretty hardcore.

It really depends. know degree viral exposure (viral load) matters quite bit, teachers might hospital-worker levels exposure cases extra emphasis needed Thank taking time respond. scare really less people getting hospitals able keep it? understand seems narrative started. still like idea freedom choice taken though. like polio mumps. mutating cold. death toll, longer term health affects.

Plus economic fallout happening regardless ...

 think key defence look countries nailing it.

In countries, nonessential workers get work. got covered unemployment pay rents mortgages frozen time. pay healthcare, businesses protected.

When anything tells economy important, understand anything what's going on. shut destroy economy people's lives. things.

But instead ready pretend right thing do. medical workers strike Jan force HK government shut border mainland china. wonder would tract third wave rate I'll fly England get it. $300 round trip probably cheaper they'd try charge US anyway think they’re warp speed program could definitely see think too, would regular virus would hassle, people know do. Unfortunately, take much effort find reasons. Gloves general population actually forbidden Spanish hospitals. masks valves. reason protect wearer, don’t contribute overall population protection. Hospitals super strict hand sanitation entry instead. Let whole state get sick. ignored months care. Even bragged one sick open. let travel Kansas joke ""inb4"" style knowing insulin price. cost without insurance somewhat 300$ week. Still stupid. happy live nyc.we eaisily one bigist epicenters pandamic.but slowly re-opaning,heck still stage one,is joyfull one.our mayor made exesivly clear face covouring.and mandated schools stay shut.and 5 months afther first cofiumed case reached nyc 0 deaths one day(not today).we know trump done anything well virus. mayors county shown trully are. good news, anti-mask crowd ones put “he shall named” White House likely November. Every cloud silver lining. Good luck caught cross fire. Meanwhile White House G.O.P. send ~~blights~~ thoughts prayers. Source ratio? lot supposed ""good news"" good look it. deniers point rapidly increasing infection rates ""good news"" deaths rising they're missing morality lag almost month increase cases. certain politicians suggest rising cases result better testing, frequently ignore positivity rates also increasing significantly (meaning increase testing issue)

But seems like good news. Also visuals. mental image Granny #2354's heart rate flatlining nothing compared mass televisation prominent symbol American dominance collapsing plume smoke.  Imagine getting free healthcare America  Navy going do!? tested positive mid February doctor said flu type even though got vaccinated October last year. 

Kinda makes wonder likely thing results suggested, instead saying sure COVID, like “yeah it’s flu”, actually flu. 

Took almost til month truly get lungs back decent lungs. 

Or maybe I’m idiot layperson flu whatever reason, still got sick it. Idk. Another thing note table: starts February 1. So, deaths pneumonia flu indicated table last month half flu season (NOT entire flu season). late March flu season year over. deaths pneumonia flu see chart cover tail end season. high numbers pneumonia flu end flu season ... Bizarre. warned. shouldn’t choice. support system place citizens don’t choose paycheck &amp; dying............. Don’t forget Arizona! :( go bar party, apparently Vermont able react much better states limit outbreaks becoming much worse.

it's faulty premise; know alternative would've looked like scott waited another week two. Personally, thought slow fuck... I've sweating virus profusely since Wuhan shut January. certainly, goes without saying we've failed contain virus.

Again; think biggest factor that's kept cases low far simple luck. Viruses instantly fill vacuum vulnerable people; needs literal time spread, places necessarily take much longer spread. New York getting torn apart Louisiana, Texas, etc good shape indicative latters' good policy; simply indicative path virus taken. Lord knows USA fine february italy got torn mean USA smart policy.

I'm... *significantly* less patient scott july he's repeating exact rhetoric *consistently* failed rest world. many fucking times try relaxing lockdown early learn work? *have* learn hard way, too? Much europe every bit vermont's equal terms social responsibility ""preparedness"", precisely jack fucking shit. 

[We great advantages. nothing special us... maybe *this* time reopening schools fucking insanity. preparations 1/10th Europe. number deaths going up, might simply New York far cases recorded. Earlier much harder get tested. What’s wrong white coats? wear instead? breaks heart read daughter thought road recovery Saturday night, oxygen up, Sunday gone. 

Fuck Covid19!

May rest peace condolences family. Florida (or US) basically situation. waited 9 days get results. two days test developed squeezing chest really worried about. virtual visit doctor wanted get chest x-ray... make appointment one without positive PCR. Thankfully chest pain cleared hell going days knowing something seriously wrong going take turn worse.

Edit: positive. Yup made mistake. thank government opening beaches WAY soon. Southern California. I’m near LA really haha Ducey early morning press conference allowing schools reopen time. are.pass peak. /S suspect would said prematurity saw. Instead saw low birth weight. course low birth weight correlated prematurity- seems odd would found significance correlate. don’t know gestation - well could control several factors long commute.

I’ve seen autism linked high stress and/or trauma (e.g loss spouse, immigration, etc). seen preterm labor linked stress stress before.  I'm rational human being. Yes, agree US rapidly falling cesspit superstition Iran, utterly failed protect people foolish dependence fairytales. 

Iran US turned backs upon reason; overflowing morgues inevitable result. Civilised countries protected populations relying SCIENCE.

As personal abuse me, that's standard response superstitious people foolishness challenged. rational argument, personal abuse first resort. (Second resort downvote, must real Iranian intellectual) mixed economy (with healthy balance capitalism fused democratic socialism) best. 

The U.S. balance tilted far toward embracing corrupt form capitalism leaves many people behind. Covid-19 exposing every day.

As Canada, crony capitalism privatized long-term care exposed. that, left-wing prevalent ideology (universal health care, federal government started crisis response sending regular cheques newly-unemployed workers, etc.) asset versus we're seeing States.

Part capitalism era globalization, Covid-19 indeed poked holes notion always safe rely foreign trade essentials (such drugs medical supplies). nice thread read. Thanks, two. well. got point mom difficulty even getting going bathroom. would almost faint trying so. That's decided go hospital. think 4 5 days first symptoms.

My advice would hesitate going hospital. Chest pain? Go hospital. mom chest pain later went back ER, doctors found blood clots lungs covid. kill get blood thinners.

Also, doctors seem treating patients like steroids. think saved mom's life. co worker younger healthier her, also asthma, got covid late March / early April make it. guessing doctors know do.

Don't worry much. take seriously. Get hospital sooner rather later needed. mom's doctors said lot patients died wait long come hospital, released come back have. dies catching grocery store? going boycott too? Indiana, general Please don’t let China Russia steal data. Darwin would pleased Millennials barely young anymore, this'll get zoomers mix change. sharing blog me?
what's ""corona fan boy""?

you're child you? thought fully formed brain, makes sense. 

have fun blogs. Texas too. Abbott went record day said it. Basically countering previous statement locking things got bad enough. Someone pointed could implications chronic pain. effect something, maybe.  That's genuinely good hear, able keep safe greater degree.

I've got couple friends Texas California eventually lost touch with, think lot lately.

Things improved lot am, comparison I'm hearing States. sooner things start improving, started opening things back again. can't imagine they're going deal numbers start climbing now, I'm suspecting will. Please save halloween. already came conclusion stop pretending need evidence  I'm wondering people even got ""forced labour"" even stated title article. article explicitly stated voluntary government jobs program get paid. wonder US Gona reintroduce virus part world keep (as second wave got control), right basically giant incubator virus, every country something national level US is....yeah Ohhh Bahamas ever able live Yup. 1 teacher going strike get fired. teachers going strike send message get shit done. Ah sorry, might missed point then. intentionally, mind you. 

Yeah, pandemic care ""nations"", logistics unfortunately often make us need approach problems/solutions national level. 

I'm still bit confused sending vaccines US/UK good. Even rest world get vaccinated right away, part world population vaccinated good. one efficient ways fight COVID-19 pandemic. get vaccinated - get sick, importantly, able spread COVID-19 others. watched Italy starting going up, finally reporting deaths. still rise big time. going long time feel US get point, we'll probably triple time. Congratulation achievement. 10,000 cases. great terrible “Hey guys remember time when” Pfizer track 100million doses December, billion doses 2021. US, get likely next 9 months, next 6 lucky. definitely word last checked. Means ""in capable manner"".  Jenner/Oxford/Indian plan along full manufacturing mode early could. started 3 months ago. waiting anything. 

The deal England fully covered, time produce 50 million doses per month. planned jump 100 million/month. planned bring big pockets available manufacturing blow fast possible. AZ came picture tied Oxford US $1.2 billion 300 million doses, followed Bill Gates $700 million 200 million doses, many others dived get line, too. US need another 400 million 2nd round injectibles. Definitely applicable some. Also prior kids. Deaths new cases lower yesterday. said 300M end year, October. UK get it’s doses October- subtle huge difference.

Also seeing plans ramp vaccination infrastructure here, happens, it’s bit moot. Expect lower number flu cases year. US summer Australia Winter season get sense bad flu season US be. Current flu cases Australia lower due social distancing protocols wearing mask. That’s good thing.  Pretty sure saw bad reporting/missing data day. infectious disease, nitwit. Go rock climbing want partake personal risk. mean there's bunch people playground, either... since apparently need told that. 3rd paragraph “WAY DOWN”? aren’t trying hide it, even mention another test see false negative cause first test results. Probably while, first health care worker people work hospitals, every school child (probably k-12) required plus teachers school workers, risk people seniors. back orders honestly take quite long say anyone get it. little side effects. would guess 2-3 years common place like flu vaccine.  Oh, take credit performing research. mind, research science nonsense beneath him. He's *businessman*.

He'll take credit made *deal*. Somehow, convoluted manner, he'll work one [exclusive vaccine get US first dibs (even though really deserve it). course take credit logistics scaling vaccine millions.

Most likely effective enough guarantee safety. likely something like 70% reduction, means basically whole population needs take order control epidemic. Since masks almost effectiveness huge portion country refuses put piece cloth face, bet antibodies they'll refuse take vaccine. all, even Trump told people [in get vaccinated. 

But stock prices soar moment announces we're getting X million vaccine units, people cheer. Trump hardcore supporters celebrate end cognitive dissonance finally legitimate reason declare pandemic ""over"". moderates grateful something offer *some* protection even guarantee. opposition begrudgingly admit step right direction.

And happens November, might make enough ground tip scales back favor. 

Never mind none mess we're would happened competent leadership - vaccine development would happened without Trump office. He'll take credit it. certain. truly scary/funny part (and maybe lucky learn) even really pandemic could having.

This virus dangerous, sure, ebola level death rate supervirus level transmission. 

The R0 high-ish high we've seen nasties like smallpox. effects deadly incredibly so.

The movie *Contagion* hits pretty well. movie shows mass graves Minnesota. virus movie kills quarter victims, synonymous ebola. 

This entire thing dry run. bad, yes, could hit much worse time around. respond like virus deadly threat would facing existential level collapse.  Read comment. pay man. Regardless much truth that, whole point peak deaths U.S. mid April. 2,000 day. Sure things may increase slightly, never see (and thankfully won't) I'm molecular biologist. article said said. see adeno proteins along ride make boosters less effective. use lps adjuvant now, that's terribly immunogenic (which point adjuvants). adeno proteins interfere boosters far know.

Edit: ok, data came today show pre existing abs vs adeno, develop lower titer abs vs covid protein, see empirically say true. still understand why, though. love American subcontinent Canada. Canada north, Uruguay south Costa Rica Central constant “you dumb fucks” neighbours developed countries handling pandemic dealing fallout, basic things like preparing thinking. Yes, countries strained struggling nobody hurting quite like USA. developed country skyrocketing cases like us I'm aware developed country unemployment high ours. countries, like UK, looking 6 7% hit unemployment, hit yes nowhere near unemployment country lol 

Everyone else dealing fallout we're still dealing first wave  l l life worth $8M purely economic reasons. include social benefits non-economic valuations get $8M. 3 cop cars peeing woman. That's much bacon. Humanity fucked try making Kentucky Fried Chicken Great Again. Yall call drum stick!! size chicken wang... Serious question: due rushed nature development, valid concerns around long term effects vaccine accounted for? know shit vaccines work, I'd imagine reason typically take long lot reasons side-stepped.

I know might come across anti-vax, not, I'm genuinely curious know second comes conversation challenge shift ""well yeah, here, safe us kids""? spokesperson Heidi Flato says company requiring customers wear masks stores.

LOL. yet another reason elementary schools open middle/high school Ya hate see it. I'm Florida visiting leave I'm trapped here? Actually, constituents angry mask mandate. Life happens, sometimes effects terrible. But, must go on. Someone mentioned West never really “bad” recent history. reality check. also get unexpected bursts church, rest homes concentrated work environment ie. lumber mill, meat packing etc. 2 weeks isn’t going anything. That’s short grand scheme things. study actually corroborated earlier results showed kids 9 spread less often. 

Of course, reduced spreading doesn’t mean it’s automatically safe open schools like many people arguing...  make sure stupid people never lead again. lost right. honestly want hear people schools reopening. want know thought process cz idk staying alive live life another decades sound better everyway missing months school Arkansas governor Nate smith secretary dept health encouraged traveling!!

“At point pandemic, it’s go, it’s do”

Granted- nice thought. But, really true all. school daughter would attending turns blind eye abuse, neglect, bullying on. math reading scores bottom 20% state Florida already pretty low ranking. 

There full blown fights school property kids get expelled for. multiple suicides middle school kids school. 

I already homeschooling happened cesspool local public school system. history teacher finally got fired, he'd telling kids holocaust really happen. 

I mean, get pediatricians coming from, but, think many actually worked school lower income area. Low income area schools provide services worry kids miss on. 

They literally shittiest babysitters. think drug addicts I'd likely trust watch kid local public school. 

The part really true, food security. lot kids eating well schools closed. Smallpox exist nature way we’re aware anymore. It’s held two labs, one US one Russia research emergency vaccine purposes. COVID targets older people fewer years life left. low-income workers exposed COVID can't work home, low-income workers less value. Kids idiots know they're talking about. parents. apparently, subset pediatricians.  Dang. bet less 25% people wear mask Daytona. ‘em seen high-fiving, joking hoax. Hey uhhh.... well see.... uhh, ha. Well we’re starting schools soon, aren’t gonna able use those. Meanwhile debate much scraps rest us get, groups got nice covid relief payday

England they've managed get testing time overnight. Despite UK government's failures, puts perspective. feel every hospital employee Florida. Y'all real MVPS. Bahamas [closed day tomorrow, guess. thought last week. ruins joke, bad.

No states ""surround"" Florida, point. borders two, northern tip.

I muddled silly point awkwardly-written joke. I'll go back cellar now. know Russia also working vaccine? far along others use fancy new techniques like RNA vaccines people questions integrity testing process, program exists.

In end think come money Trump. Walmart? They'll literally fire saying word union. ""...a lapse leadership President Donald Trump..."" _lapse_, really? Lmao. Less moisture air means droplets produce travel further. humid air droplets produce drop ground faster. that's huge lag reporting. Also everyone getting tested see going take long get results anyways. bother waiting line 5 hours get test results 10 days later? That's pointless said deaths week ahead test results wrong. yeah, get it. means comment meant make people feel hopeless.

You correct, however, petitions _are_ useless now. Obama presidency, would garner response given enough attention, I'm fairly certain Trump's administration commented single one. Shoutout Karens Orange County, y'all really flattened curve there. people immunocompromised able get it. seem odd masks become bigger issue closing businesses schools, restricting travel. Masks probably one least restrictive disruptive measures take stop virus, yet they're far contentious. Trump said numbers we're testing! really already people go work kids go school!

/s   problem majoity people COVID-19 minds two options - survive, die.

And yet far people 3rd option nobody even considering talking much - survived, body fucked now.

And think bad now, way US medical system is, wait insurance companies say COVID-19 pre-existing condition. 2k month per person! username :) &lt;3   fuck wrong knowledge history? British sent convicts America Australia. USA nothing one. Get golden throne I'll make best it. Florida going look like World War Z Legend soon...  Everything called ""major breakthrough"" now. :/ support him? Yeah noticed curve too, almost textbook perfect, 'smooth'. Almost everyday new record.

Also usage word ""release"" awkward. sensible person tell ""corona go back partying like 2019"". sensible people tell certain activities pose acceptable risk. don’t think that’s meant “great American melting pot.” Gross, spot imagery. know, that's less entertaining topic masks work. fuck cares? change fact Florida 10000 cases 5th day downplayed measures needed contain pandemic, absolutely crazy given countries affected virus already verge beating it. Would possible access dissertations? Seriously asking...not trying snarky. 

I jstor account give title could maybe find there. lucky enough one -about 5 thousand (of 40k capacity stadium) allowed watch footy team live weekend. Felt like everything simultaneously normal (due routine all) nothing like normal all. times quiet could hear someone shouting side stadium hear players talking field Question mask: rhinitis issue b4 this(on off), mountain area moment locked inside almost whole day.

I experienced extreme sinus pain + difficulty breathing climb slope yesterday, forced open mask.

Couldnt seek ent right obvious reason.is bcos cloth mask something else? advice? Everything bizarre 2020 even know extraterrestrial issue yet. Thanks insight JB, assumed much. 

Is debt US compared NHS la Securite Sociale France though? I'd imagine not, know NHS la Secu really high debt.

But yes, appears two tiered system private+basic public healthcare used US Australia inefficient actually wastes much money, private establishments leech money government patients get freaking rich. Might need abandon ship... Mask mandates social distancing needed, evidenced literally every developed country earth. know else say without beating dead horse. cannot afford economic shut without financial assistance. American people BROKE. economic collapse spell financial slavery people ever America. economy goes south, poor under-privleged pay highest price. 

The numbers invoked virtually useless themselves. Everything we've covered speculation. Yes, even ""reasoning"" speculation figures using literal doomsday figures. experts can't prove thing kills 10 million people (and haven't), certainly going conversation. 

What *isn't* speculation America cannot afford shut down. already willing go full authoritarian steal peoples well being, would FAR better simply imposing greater penalties non-compliance masks social distancing.

Edit: Think way. Say shut down. what? long? Certainly vaccine comes, could take years. Two months? Maybe. what? end boat people flood election halls (probably) protest outrageous shit world? cases spoke what? Close again? see shut SOLUTION? Even thing could kill 10 million people, STILL SUSTAINABLE SOLUTION. would still need get fucking heads asses come actual long term plan. even want argue hahahahaha.

""This time I'm going Wuhan work, want increase family's income live good life efforts."" really happened? source? Genuinely curious. see Russia closed borders March 27th. hate say emperor may butt naked, but... can't find independent verification testing works.

None. matter fact, testing results contradicted autopsies retroactively checked contradicted Seattle flu study retroactively checked flu samples December February Seattle area wait, there's more.

A company called Biobot announced creation sewage testing March. April 8th announced first offer cities use breakthrough sewage testing covid: can't find single sewage test involved in.

\-Masschusetts:  Hole on, on, literally, every city earth that's done sewage test - could find associated lab, Biobot.

Oh, mention April 21 used announcement new sewage analytics start raising seed money: summation: 
\- Biobot new product, one independently confirms works 
\- Rather seeking outside approval confirmation tests, use publicity partnerships announce first round funding. 
\- results get tons publicity, even though findings presence covid unsupported, fact contradicted independently verified means testing, real world statistics used track epilogical events (excess deaths).

I'm saying sewage test smells like shit, but... know difference marketing science; one relies outside verification peer review, essential raising seed money. even marrying Chinese spouse confer work status.  makes extremely difficult foreigners live work there.

Well, another funny thing western media tried terrify Chinese people saying central government sending troops Wuhan Jan. quite opposite, people Wuhan city relieved reliable source could imagine coming save them, disappointed soldiers deployed. Actually taxes realy low US. states state income tax Trump's tax cut rich, actually quite high add everything up. Even tax cuts, low. Americans think social benefits ""tax"" reality, want compare tax rates Europeans, compare income tax part leave social benefits it. comparing apples apples. 

If add American's yearly spend healthcare premiums, co-pays, deductibles etc income tax, comparing right percentage europeans. guarantee lower point. healthcare too, never mind money pay college education, property tax, etc. 

Next time someone asks this, ask much spend healthcare year, tell add taxes come back tax rate!

America good place you
- Make lot cash
- young healthy kids (and make lot cash)

Otherwise, struggling. assume meant Disney World, much open. know record breaking though. extremely small crowds relative normal. nobody knows - think _millions_ know mortality less 1% simply hyperbole. Good thing hoax, right?  argue true worldwide. 

Rich people companies always find ways pay less taxes get richer. Heck, I'd it, see not? France take 75% million earned, least tried. would stay gonna lose 75% income? I'd head straight Malta Portugal set-up shop there, paying less, enjoying sun. Per capita, California went good job mediocre job period months.

Meanwhile South went hardly affected disaster zone matter weeks.

Hey you, looked whole comment section. see doing...

Thanks around support us Americans time turmoil, hurt, desperation! God knows need prayers, comforts get right now. Would explain lung damage found ""asymptomatic"" folks younger people zero symptoms drop dead due blood clots? small step closer victory, step nonetheless. I'm American feel targeted comment, disagree you. 

America fought freedom British 18th century. civil war fighting freedom part citizens 19th century. contributed towards freedom world twice 20th century, albeit forced Germans killed US civilians, still, did. 

I discuss operation iraqi freedom desert storm, questionable, signalled continuation change started Korean war Vietnam wars. 

The US country built freedom helping others remain free, today image lost behind wall bullturd politics, poor health people, Trump's tweets :) US spends much public money healthcare lot European countries, 8% GDP, Britain spends slightly less fund NHS. US spends money grossly inefficient private healthcare system get limited programmes rather free universal healthcare. interpreted “I don’t give shit boomer boners say”

And I’m sticking stupid reason thought like instantaneous hotline something every hospital reports daily. makes sense.

It’s stupid. It’s work... UK, every hospital reports daily death figures.

Granted, don’t count weekend though (they run reduced staff levels), include Monday’s figures. downvotes getting incredible. people really think UK would better waiting longer paying vaccine developed Britain EU programme? 

I see small country would use it, purchasing power would much better bloc, UK already huge established partnerships companies. could release free, university made don’t see shouldn’t public. honestly care less fools places like this, let die whatever viruses want. sucks spreading people trying safe. turn keeping country recovering damn virus. Fools No, he's suggesting much tool understand difference two. Sorry, really, I'm buying anymore. need even look numbers know there's something wrong way handles treats others. often immediately shuts people insults soon pose question like, example - that's behavior someone who's aboveboard, nothing hide. getting downvoted? good question. easy people exploit loopholes? Children camps libraries still running seems counter productive? Unless procedures implemented? Dont get mad, sorry offended 3000 USA OPV known cause polio time US banned switched IPV.

Don’t make plans based potential vaccine developed. ,are paranoid ignorant fools. Sorry that, thought clarify somewhere else :) this? Twitter, guys carrying like landed moon. Yeah, I'd say motivation thing too. 

I come nothing, remember one year 0 income ate rice year. parents scrape year in, year still today. spent entire education working hard, side jobs (Security guard, steward football stadium, various side-gigs) worked socks internship instead bear minimum.

I'd say mindset plays big role, people need depend less state others, educating failing, picking up, failing again, pathway success.

Also, meth, alcohol, help succeed. simple things didn’t cost much (in medical world), stuff would much cheaper. 

Yet, plenty countries figured make work fiscally. 


We terribly less cost-effective system needs overhauled. also angry lot It’s weekend. Well thr infection rate lineaerly growing exponential keep reading Boomhauer's voice King Hill. No, SARS-CoV-2 virus, COVID-19 disease reaction said virus. saying they've found six types ways people react virus. VAT applicable all, based ones income. pay VAT country, way is. France, usually 19.6%, things like eating meds lower rate. 

I'd also argue VAT EU specific. Chile 19% VAT. China 17% VAT 5-10% consumption tax.
The US Sales Tax, mentioned VAT equivalent varies state state. Australia 10% GST, Canada 5% GST.

What I'm saying is, VAT/GST Europe specific thing. 
This however mean US, get cheaper groceries, cars, gas, etc.
I actually can't even find simple google search VAT tax used countries, I'm assuming goes towards social welfare, infrastructure jazz Europe. case, necessarily bad thing, break arm Europe, free, whereas US potentially 10k + USD expense pocket. I'll take VAT 7% sales tax buy less stuff :) must dislike much. NHS funding huge reason Brexit. also lie, matter. pure stupidity. also next level asshole entitlement. get sick get cured within period time I’m Nashville, Governor fucking idiot, Mayor wearing masks indoors law. considering going back phase 1.

Reducing Americans' understanding China helps PROPAGANDA US government. 

 hard Americans imagine like Chinese see news western media . way see idiots oppose masks. 

 huge gap two groups' knowledge information. Chinese almost much difficulty convincing Americans convincing idiots anti-mask. 

You conspiracy theories, like CCP-bot, brainwash. Idiots believe masks suffocate, metal bars antennas control them. 

 best way travel China person.But imagine number people, American willing take ***risk*** going China, actually suspicious media. Traveling sure, could still find ways prove .

 People really trust media travel China, even people traveled come back tell truth, think they've brainwashed threatened .

 hard convince people masks harmless . Think China . Ah gotcha. Silly cynical me. Bad dog! No! outside! BAD dog! Naughty! Mmmmm spyware consider exponential growth.  guess reopening gusto May premature? republicans know whole voter base old people want country go back suffering finish retirement peace. killing many vulnerable people can. ones evicted, ones savings forced work close contact sick, mostly young minorities.

AIDS, whole constellation illnesses issues could categorized conditions secondary AIDS. Likewise, diabetes, eye kidney damage could written secondary diabetes.

Likewise, conditions secondary pre-existing condition handled variety ways. 

Right now, literally dozens conditions secondary SARS-CoV-2, neurological issues strokes kidney conditions heart problems, etc etc etc. State legislators insurers trying figure SARS-CoV-2 secondary conditions handled sounds like giant fucking nightmare. 

Perhaps “that’s works” (well, worked) are, every state rules regulations (this presumably also true Puerto Rico unincorporated territories, laws unincorporated territories complicated messy, I’m sure level federal oversight exists Insurance Commissioners circumstances). true Washington necessarily true Mississippi, etc. Finally honest, reply simplistic clearly attachment reality.

""when they're close proximity orifices they're checking mouth, need bodily fluids getting them"" - realize patients often sedated outwardly projecting bodily fluids perhaps puss blood reaching anyone's mouth.

You also seem think infection needs liquid transmitted rather breathing.

""""you're always touching readjust face mask"" - not, all. put facemask on, adjust comfortable, wear it. data dating civil war reduction spreading infection.

""so getting virus face""- infections like jam. worry spreading face.

Do understand viruses function? step step mechanism virus goes infecting host shared someone exposed, turn infecting new host. Could verbalize process? understand mass threshold levels particles involved?

I find people sharing opinions truly clue infection process works. that's insult way, that's off-hand knowlege. truly fascinating.

You replies really seems defy basic understanding process. again, there's nothing wrong that. cases, would recommend read data someone shares prior replying. reference speak data presented response. That's fruitful lobbing guesses, wishes, third hand ""telephone-game-knowledge"". I'm also lose everything close again.

It's almost like Congress give us monthly checks something. wonder could holding up? say, though, masks massive part many EU countries' strategies. mandatory masks made last month, places like NL, DK, GB Ger they're always commonly worn even now. Hm means trend probably continue next two weeks Canadian, you’re right. heart surgeon U.S. far likely chance immigrating Canada successfully compared American day labourer. kind competition. Nothing wrong starting process. 

What won’t work claiming refugee status. succeed must convince courts would mortal danger return country. may true sense, competing applicants war zones camps throughout world. 

Finally, must appreciate deep irony American, whose country Trump brutally reduced amount refugee applications Syrian refugee crisis, whole world opened borders, assuming get refugee too. Also children cages. guys genuinely cruel heartless entire world last three years. (the world except Israel Russia) low-key enraged country. Especially Canadians, love America: so, disappointed guys. may grumpy fellow citizen coming from. live vaccine, sounding like be. I'm 21 idea millennial now. thought zoomer, makes rules mean free charge I'm sorry sir, Red Ventilators, offer extra scoop Rona Covid? think China get control. stroke reading I'd finished re-reading Station Eleven Jan I'd heard HBO TV adaptation. Absolutely beautifully written, virus book deals (Georgia Flu) similar symptoms Covid, 99% mortality rate... I've thinking frequently last months - much anxiety! truly believe 10 million dead better economic collapse? 

Okay,were great conversation seem like reading points completely. Even knew 10mm would die, shut alone going solve that. would still take months years us even reach number. shut absolutely positively complete sustainable solution. 

I never said 10 million 5 million deaths would also bad economy. saying shutting economy sustainable solution. incomplete action even guarantee escape deaths. half country shut still shit. obviously shut going enough.

If going avoid upper end devestation, need implement emergency UBI continue enforcing mask social distancing mandates.

Edit: far evidence economic collapse. paying attention millions missed rent mortgage? staggering unemployment rates? unemployment benefit. happens rent mortgage relief end? unemployment dries up? question economy hard ride. Another shut would obviously make worse. Unless course provided financial assistance. 

I saw part believe stupid. unfortunate challenging conversation days seems devolve someone insulting side. hope reconsider actually try understand argument was, seems without doubt went head.

Edit 2: provided numbers backing side up, either. used hypothetical, doomsday scenario numbers. None actually prove shut would net positive. agreed central argument though, shut needs accompanied financial assistance. left confused felt need call stupid. active city subreddit make resident city either. looked particular user, popular tactic users frequent sub city live attempt shift perceived Overton Window. cut testing. tax cuts rich people? far significant spikes coronavirus among people protesting mostly wore masks fact outside significantly reduced risk. Also India would amongst first get vaccine since manufacturing going happen Serum Institute India. hope people around World wait long end 2021. Apart availability, adoption would also major factor would determine things go back one work, means there's large supply elsewhere.  winning much Exactly. 10k per day. would 10, 20, 40, 80, 160k ... Ah, yes. I'm sure kids love learn geometry outside, December, Maine. Sounds lovely. staff Verizon deal piss. Disgusting woman. government structure, state level, ability access emergency funding coordinate endeavors like across states. I'll bet competent leadership hypothetical government entity could absolutely get done. would kind like Kennedy's moon initiative: seemingly insurmountable task impossible timeline, except extremely hard work American ingenuity, inspired transcendent leader, get done. Hell, look WWII manufacturing initiatives back home supply front line troops. Truly entire country coming together inspirational leadership defeat common obstacle.

Too bad government entity leadership role exist facilitate crazy idea. Instead, states left figure alone, run money due sudden economic downturn. shame. lol can't imagine class freezing ass time. makes people think kids think differently means we're going need boosters. Happy cake day level change really expect. minor niche stuff really change anything. also happened Trump Administration, even less effective now. difference now, even token level useless things like things listed wont even happen. really want judge effectiveness process, look items submitted caused change actually important get anywhere REAL change. bet list vastly dwarfs small token successes. What's success rate everything changed vs actually changed percentage wise? pretty low miserable percentage that's what.

That's kind stuff designed for. tire spinning wheels false sense satisfaction actually anything. pretty much antithesis people protest masks wearing mask throwing tantrum private business opposite side political spectrum. really think making difference like are.

But hey, makes feelings feel better despite accomplishing anything, go ahead live false delusion actually making difference.

I defeatist ideology. know dumb. simply can't force people see things want to. work opening people's eyes Spirituality unseen connections usually ignore associate values true many actually forced us society we're never even aware false even though evidence right front us.

Just like said, protests nothing move people's hearts make lasting change. really shame companies government basic token things appease masses. pretty much political theater steam valve anger masses wont revolt actual workings system cause oppression feed money fatties known rich.

Be mad protest sign petitions til exhausted tired work toward real change. That's basically designed for, accomplishing goal.

It comes nothing though like minded young people actually go vote. act like do, young friends wont hate them. never actually vote, politicians incentive make actual changes them. like Bernie Sanders dropped supporters never actually registered went vote him, gave knew would able win Presidential race. reality. corona virus excuses gave dropping lies keep base learning nothing. never gonna win even virus never happened.

The current political system devices way make political change. current government essentially two purposes 1: make rich richer 2: keep peasantry control illusion control using ""democracy"", ""voting"" controlled outlets rage actually nothing protesting. Rich people watch protests TV feel fear. Instead laugh heads sipping wine costs well make entire lifetimes.

Black Lives Matters major movement long? done? Basically nothing, that's exactly point. form ""change"" work. Yeah change, cause Democracy actually worked would changed long ago, are. Police STILL indiscriminately killing people consequences. Sure get caught every while, called bad apples distanced. truth, cops way. racist duty, actually regular non racist folks daily lives. Racism built purposefully jobs another form control population. 

Don't think weird racism still exists America? serves systemic purpose power elite, that's whole different rant altogether.

People think solution Black Lives Matters type problems police adopt better anti racist guidelines, really systemic problem society Police exist protect property rich keep means productions control money continually control, secondly enforce laws poor people keep inline working military deterrent enact true justice immoral rich people care wealth power.

The solution American Societies problems get young people actually go vote numbers, nothing works. threat Donald Trump becoming President charisma Bernie Sanders anything. unless got something better Bernie Sanders pocket, there's nothing accomplish protesting petitions. things work would need charismatic leader could move hearts others point become open truth properly motivated make lasting change, system checkpoints keep people like out.

As loser conspiracy theorist going make headway fighting problems society controlled inefficient way meant to, designed specifically tire make look like crazy deluded person follows heart detriment, enough people wont get behind make lasting change. People see personally weak worth emulation weak ineffective. people support strength rallying beacon.

In Nietzschien Philosophy escaped ""camel"" ""Lion"" stage pointlessly fighting Dragon (society) fighting Dragon hella fun exhausting leaves nice docile tired, really get anywhere huge Dragon incentive comply. charismatic leader mirrors ideology, gonna get anywhere except get Government Corporations make token changes order avoid pretty minimal Public Relations problems. even make judgement PR nightmare less advantages situation creates changes would lasting systemic, nothing actually change. government Democracy. Independent research viewpoints show Oligarchy Democratic steam valves let population inefficiently get rage calm never become threat rich power. Thinking using ""tools"" Democracy, like protesting, make actual change Oligarchy foolish. 

Just look, still Mexican children cages make shift prison warehouses around united states separated parents simply form punishment, accept it. Why? much basic Human Crime basic decency is, children political power, pawns psychologically tortured prove political power president nothing else. absolutely nothing gain kids cages. deterrent, make money. anything except make money private businesses keeping rabbits expensive cages saving money never hiring actually qualified people run place properly minimize psychological damage. simply flex Presidents political penis ability send money corporate supporters donate portion money next political campaign cause owe making richer. 

We live society. really fucked one, that's it. already live oppressive dystopia, there's sorts distractions steam valves give us illusion control. 

When go vote choosing two candidates carefully chosen rich policies chosen rich actually change anything systemic. society, like Bernie Sanders, can't get money behind way system designed, can't make lasting change. token changes make population feel like control. political theater, merely non major actor efforts, playing rewritten role screaming prewritten protest script already written rich power.

But makes feel better go protest that's thing stopping form permanently getting sucked defeatist attitude, go right ahead. Go outside, protest inefficiently, possibly catch corona virus disorganized non social distancing masses leader tell space fuck 6 feet. go right ahead keep spinning wheels ineffectively.

I'm defeatist. see gonna take way hard work society support I'm cause I'm working within system chagrin. see American society really is: political theater quelling rage masses keep control. Well, one cares selfish anti-vaxer like dies, people bring care about. 

So *your* chances, innocent people around you. Emergency rooms tend lab site, test results come back much quicker standard drive-thru test. Yes, believe actually logistic growth though, assuming people immunity infection. words eventually virus run new hosts reach, growth slow down.

Obviously hopefully get point, would get actually got everyone infected, especially thanks us actually distancing even ridiculous amount people not. keep thinking virus killed similarly gruesome way ebola people would take seriously, like bleeding eyes nose fingers. looks “like flu” see coughing doesn’t seem bad. 

I mean, “we’ve colds before!” /s course are, know handle virus moreso wishing people catch virus based upon different political views?   definitely minimise though focusing Ireland instead France EU business example, saving bucket-loads. loved it, easy transition classroom first. 


It snows cold several months year, layered clothes, extra changes clothes, specialized clothes necessary. children chosen are, necessity, able dress undress themselves; go bathroom themselves; able hike, bike tolerate different temperatures. able feed themselves, clean themselves, able follow directions well. 


Parents agree drive school property, us 45-minute drive. School started earlier drove friend's child every day friend work drive time, got super early every day. 


It expensive. extra equipment would barrier some, parent's group great job making sure students properly outfitted. 


It required flexibility required work completed home. weather wet, math reading sent home complete. 


None terrible, experiences overwhelmingly positive. 


Our child developed deep love nature imagined possible. Even years later, love hike, draw, observe, journal. understand value nature - means souls minds. 


They came away loving science. one thing read life cycle frog; another watch frogs every day person, draw pictures observe, keep detailed notes, test/measure/record water/temperature/etc. 


Our child acquired deeper sense community deeper desire help others. free period, children went pine forest built wikiups. Day day, improved building techniques, helping encouraging other. child already kind, generous person, seeing children kind acts pushing help positively changed felt others. 


I would love see forest schools world. probably every student, participate, life-changing. 


If could change anything experience, would - make widely available. 


I'd like see forest school programs adapted children learning disabled physically disabled. #LivingInReality think might replied wrong person....  herd immunity? come one's talking anymore? Tbh alot Karen's becoming anti maskers guess doubling stupidity good call lol. Tho think idiots treated vaccines certain failure rate, in, won’t give 100% protection get it, require enough people get vaccine get point virus can’t spread. enough people don’t get it, virus still gets run wild. I'm assuming sarcasm, I'm wondering downvotes? likely they've reached limit testing capacity, curve magically flattened itself. winning 🥇 Bc like beaches gots smart guberner like Trumps butt. live near popular beach town FL it’s literally deemed busiest tourist season ever officials. gotten better 75/25 mask ratio Walmart versus 40/60 weeks ago. Can’t wait mask mandate today. want less people riots start. will. 40m+ unemployed can't paid forever. they're many tests tests getting done taking longer longer get back.

If test 10,000 people day never going get 10,000 new cases day(in figures, obviously cases would still exist) No, what's going right now, sound dramatic all. people walking around denial problem, mean nasty way. mean, they're gonna wake point, gonna cope? highly suspect, even, lot denial already can't cope. least friends ahead curve way - dealing shock now, far better shape (even feel good moment). That's cool taking precautions. get worried though. still me. Good luck. long legal. think they've called backhoes now. positive thing kinda related US.  
We need US. US hear? Guilt kill generation entirely predictable. lack data- we've known masks work slow infection respiratory illnesses least hundred years, probably earlier. Officials scientists made irresponsible statements mask use idiot known would come back haunt us all. trying push false narrative get people to, surgeon general typed caps, ""STOP BUYING MASKS."" wanted masks elsewhere.

Well, think going happen trust deceive like that? actually believe gospel natural selection. sometimes go it. 

That's good way release stress. Americans care anyone themselves. (I American) everyone know anti-mask bother inform what's going rest world. steward charged defense state. Florida’s armies? hurt hottie, Mr. Hot Stuff ;\* Love comment. God bless working frontlines, thinking feet figuring disease best  killed themselves, point I’d give up. doesn’t. spread others die. fair, losing job US pretty devastating.

Not lose income, also health insurance. social safety nets also pretty crap. instance, Florida's unemployment insurance program designed work purpose keep people form claiming it.

Then consider people's finances situation. Super high housing, education, healthcare costs. Stagnant wages decades; society encourages spending saving; etc.

Really though, people talked to, seem think going *other* people die vs dying rather changing. Hopefully shut people wanted reopen. get alot pressure sadly probably forced behind scenes open. widespread say, safe assume exponential growth least week. We've considering something like Kindergarten son.

Basically, we've invited join group 4 total kindergarteners. families agree ""close loop"", see \*nobody\* outside ""pod"".

Then hire recently retired teacher group see ""normal"" make kindergarten.

We're leaning towards right now, we're still sure. y'all think?

edit: probably throw know trust parents. We're ""more-strict"" end spectrum. noted like that, curious intelligent among us deal people regular basis. Wait mean 500-1000 countrywide? Isn’t US nearly 150k? California around 4K deaths believe. work? I'm sorry guys India. I'm hopefully pharma industry ramp vaccine production quickly available. least know died of.  could little kinder days insane! hope you’re okay. wait norm right now?  Apple stores nationwide required masks employees customers since reopening. Glad bean counters thought differently. Feels safe. US going permanently quarantined world Home Depot poppin Southern California shut down. IDK everyone flocked HD fucking stupid you?

ah, typical condescending redditor, dishing hypothetical doomsday scenarios stewing brain since march.

i know know everything mommy's proud, let's *not* assume anything except already _actually_ know.

the virus _is_ going play out, friend - bar miracle vaccine, guarantee. lockdowns prolong inevitable truth point life, probably exposed covid-19. 

we enact reasonable measures contact tracing, mask wearing social distancing. fearmongering recklessness statewide (and even countrywide) lockdowns redditors absolutely begging insane. temporary measures years damage virus could never hope even spread like plague - continue to. 

may recommend communist paradise China inclined live boot authoritarian government keep shut room months years feel what's best you. guy embarrassed himself. Dying one else’s business survive American way oh piss got money says season ain’t happenin’... China bad m'kay /s well beginning. Cases rising, fast, hospitalizations we’re slowly going down. suddenly opened much randomly - bars? gyms?? movie theaters??? scolds us “gathering” *threatens* close things again... messaging confusing, super guilt blame throwing, wonders nobody listens anymore. definitely wait bit. first vaccine comes out, able get it.

First line old people, people lung conditions, medical workers, military, government officials, anybody else deemed risk important.

Months later, 100 million people already vaccinated, finally get turn. Quick wiki search showed Uighur ancestors appear Mongols well natives Tarim Basin. puts Xinjiang area. Chile is.the leading economy south america completely destroyed virus He's right.

It's planning keep letting people die.  Sure, ideally partner better alone. interacted humans months. drives batty. us want it. Florida Governor like: ""Wipe out! them...""  Look me, captain   Oh shit, Tears Fears/Gary Jules reference?!

If so, mad respect. Mad world, mad respect. nah, fine. underestimate intense people get doxxing here. want make sure accidentally inadvertently give much personal info. hope fiancee feels better soon! I've reapproved comment course not, he's politician. single Mayor Governor thinking re-election first, money second lives third.  basing exactly what? willing test theory loved ones? BASIC thing understand data cases get, people die. unquestionably true even nations smart handled it. country absolutely idiotic dealing instead made worse every turn. yet want assume learned enough stop deaths can’t even lower rate people contracting it? make sense you? Here’s another little news flash: even get vaccine one month, won’t able dose enough people next six months build herd immunity. vaccine would helpful, even vaccine isn’t like virus going disappear night. Please basic ass research open mouth, wishful thinking isn’t constructive dealing something complexity. Dooooooo something!!! Fucking help us!!!!! Christ sake!!!!!!😡 deal anti-maskers also anti-vaccination fucks put ALOT faith people would approve this. could link dozens dozens treatments FDA approval later pulled horrible side effects They’re comparing economic devastation 50-100 deaths state maybe 500-1000 countrywide. don’t understand open things back wide it’ll 10s thousands daily. started enforcing masks heavily sales went up. There's people taking seriously think word got store takes seriously started pick up. We've nice people hired good security company. Overall great Non paywalled link: many people going recover, wonder.

i also wonder public forget this, situation ever ends. Non paywalled link: need speak manager now! 🤣  Without vaccine countries gained local elimination many gained suppression. vaccine half effective short time still give many countries opportunity hit elimination point. 

There silver bullets expect vaccine one either. However good governance short term pain even OK vaccine help hell lot. things, y’know. die covid cash ticket lost belongings nobody family thinks look lotto ticket wallet car visor grieving. whole thing viral marketing Chernobyl season 2. dont understand school needs happen right now. insistence returning people will.knowingly die, including children, absurd. really nothing children actually around sports schooling? trained children completely useless unable anything else? least understand logic people. horrible choice make, society put value human life. trade-off 200k COVID deaths versus completely destroyed economy, think there's valid uncomfortable discussion had.

But really, COVID deaths health economy trade-off. Getting virus control help economy medium long term. real issue dealing short term hit millions households minimizing length severity. Earlier lockdowns universal mask laws would help that. insane. better anti mask conspiracists yet. Wait till mutates flu kiddo. may want check list killers.    already city county mandates Ohio ineffective. People businesses ignoring completely. businesses put signs nothing wearing masks chin guards, pulling talk, carrying inside. absolutely infuriating. Well, guess less Republican voters /s Jesus Christ imagine many new cases actual Black Friday create. Department stores lot states probably aren’t going close. comes pandemic government almost unlimited powers curb freedoms, long courts deem reasonable.

&amp;#x200B;

If 100% chance infection airborne virus give 100% chance death, bet we'd flamethrowering people appreciate you. lovely day. God split hilariously u-shaped ""United States Coastal Elites"" sister country centre, ""Middle Age-merica"" already *risk dying , necessarily die . We're fucked natural selection happening realtime... havnt neighbor's mom lives Villages. sort bronchial problem couple times year. visiting. yells across yard ""I'm healthy"" I'm thinking never healthy wtf here????? Later, hear neighbor saying 'you remember get there?' I'm thinking omg, going somewhere else? Covid Cora. part 4d chess generic name heparin ""porcine"". LOL  I’m RN CEO hospital interviewed news . encouraged people go Disney World &amp; talked season pass (sounded like sponsored tbh), employees scrambling around even enough staff beds available cover increasing amount Covid patients we’re getting. Gotta love Overflow beds get complicated, also depend staff use them. 1 nurse per 2 beds max ICU gets tight staffing quickly, especially since hospitals affected areas short staffed due covid.

A weeks ago wife's hospital transfer patients across mountains due lack ICU beds. hospital could adapted part Telemetry beds, 30+ staff members due covid physical beds useful. 

The hospital could brought staff board, didn't. I'm guessing didnt want pay travel contracts non profitable situation top sick leave. Cheaper declare full move patients.

The good news mask mandate went effect county daily cases way (still high), ICU space 2 patients vents (down 18). Considering current numbers able contain it, answer well kids healthiest babies toddlers I've ever seen. son 6, daughter 3, NEVER ""had catch vomit hands/kid got sick diarrhea room"" types horror story situations parents share other. 

I mean, got mild coughs spit milk babies that's it. 3 year old never vomited, 6 year old vomited maybe 3 times life, 2 eating something fast went wrong way basically spitting half chewed babybel cheese like... Stomach bug puke ocean. 

The time ever puked sick around 3 non issue rolled over, puked blanket corner toddler bed, moved side bed fell back asleep without even waking us. next morning went wake like, ""Oh no! feeling ok? Completely surprised come wake us. 

He like ""YUP, COUGHED GRAPES!"" seemed totally fine. Nothing phases kid. even hose him/his room after. jammies spotless one blanket hit needed washing. That's literally worst I've parent terms dealing sick kid. I'm totally untested parent.

Most healthy, convenient kids ever. like ""OMG GET SICK ALWAYS COME GET US WE'LL HELP YOU!"" shrugged like ""Nah, big deal tired wanted go back bed."" Kid unmovable. 

Then started preschool. holy hell. exposure new germs means every first week school/back break, picks something. part powers always definitely couple nights he's coughing hours running fever KID THAT. 

What's worse passes sister, passes us 3 still gross 3 year old things like sticking fingers mouth least expect sneezing directly eyeballs.

She start preschool wondering going hit family (two kids two different schools bringing home different strains things, exciting!) pandemic hit might holding preschool enrollment unless done online (which, what's point 3 year olds unless amazing program.) 

We'll keeping 6 year old home distance learning least first quarter see things going area reevaluating.

I've gotta say, last thing went family cold 6 year old brought home school right break Feb. school shut March nobody's single sniffle since. 

Goddamn schools petri dishes. kids strongest immune systems ""whatever, we'll live, let's go play"" reaction sick ever even get knocked shit brought home school. Sickly kids stand chance.

Add Coronavirus mix nightmare brewing teachers, school employees, kids families. Hard pass.   tell bring toilet paper. Thanks  you’re young, it’s hard understand mortality consequences. probably would done something like kid stuck home long lock downs. CDC site provisional death counts covid, pneumonia, flu. scroll Texas states. 

Read footnotes categories carefully. subtract one category vs. another get flu+pneumonia deaths. 

Other users posted better explanations data states. wonder put Storm Trooper helmet top regular mask.  hope keeps awake every night rest life. shame insane stupid cause pain stress forever. fucking nut case greatest experiment human history.

Also, many healthcare workers died? 400? less generous 6 years schooling 2400 years school. 2400 years people learning save lives take care others, gone. mention lives lost. 

It tragic happening. know wrong early takes, read comments wearing masks inside respect getting board things neccessary.

All best yours. Nurgle taken state! Hold lines! Cadia stands! /warhammer40k 


Close entire state already. Oh shoot wrong image.

Here's coronavirus licking lips Yes got next day results could get surgery Illinois. fast tracked, people get test turn around 2 days. learned protests testament wearing masks w/o social distance outdoor settings prevents spread COVID.

An outdoor sports event totally fine long everyone wears masks. outdoor dining, raves, concerts bars.

If COVID spread protests social distance, COVID spread sport events, raves, concerts outdoor restaurants bars. wear mask wash hands. I’m sorry guys deal firsthand.

From I’ve seen/heard, people don’t believe you. They’ll say “your BF exaggerating, it’s really bad.” miracle believe you, they’ll say “China gave us virus, blaming government China?” large enough fragment brain look past that, might say “People die time. due pandemic like nothing could done it.” keeps going. don’t know argue people know outcome. It’s like fucking telemarketing script it’s every single time. better make world poor huh dumb you. people die, sorry specifically, eg 43% infected Bizkaia region (over weekend) 10-19 years old. government banned youth gatherings indoors outdooors, gatherings ten people demanded universal mask carry even open spaces (since people suck understand proper usage). FWIW Australians getting results 2-4 days (depending weekend spikes) Victoria we're outbreak.

So that's either overwhelmed already woefully underequipped handle situation.  Wow that’s dumbest shit I’ve heard today. 

Yesterday Covid Parties.

What’s tomorrow? #A Trend! Protests certainly part surge, however lockdown, stimulus drying can’t really force people stay home cooperate contact tracing anyway. Virus still spread point, keep way is. 

Honestly nobody really reopens early, original shut prolonged multiple times already many stares counties, stimulus money drying many reopen. Half people also tired original quarantine final 1 2 weeks, lockdown work US, Culture way different EU certain Asian countries. That’s reality , 50% population get tired another shutdown first 1-2 weeks, won’t even patience last 4 weeks like last time. Face mask mouth, N95s chin. Got Well, we're great again.  never understood argument either, see well economy 250 k dead better yet death rate %1 3 million people dead, realize that’s full infection rate even quarter dead decimate economy. fact discussing disturbing me, tell people don’t mind pile dead bodies please go buy stuff beyond stupid me. pandemic lay bare much 3rd world shithole US really is. Classic Alpha maneuver Even ignoring argument completely, fear dying causes economic anxiety lasts longer nothing about.

Thousands people died die him, students spread virus like wildfire.  Cus it’s dumbasses reddit don’t know anything I'm hearing lot Governors, senators representatives states. winning keeps coming sick Winning Simple. Blow hand. Put mask blow again. Hmmm. Pretty basic difference. like this. ﻿ Basically:

Stay home + wear mask stay home going global history tests future generations. wonder Trump get remembered anything good (or great even)? Ding ding ding forget actual cases always higher confirmed cases. 

 
Covid19-projections estimates 11.9% Florida infected date, 4.2% currently infected, 63,000 cases added per day (about 0.3% population). 


At rate, they'll reach \~25% (the rate we've observed infection burn places like Italy, Spain New York) 6 weeks. would reach 70% little half year. private Catholic schools California going full-bore reopening. is, Newsom stepped put number counties watch list prohibits school reopening unless county case threshold couple weeks.

The teachers working at-will, fired time. also told considered Deacons, even though conduct religious services. significant, legally prohibits teachers suing Diocese negligence putting teachers students harm's way.

It huge relief governor intervened. would impacted rich suburbanites profoundly. damn ironic people hate Newsom what's best health. keep seeing things saying unaffordable capitalism bla bla bla? Wow inspiring CEO! 

Many CEOs learn man become true heartless Stock Value Machine. #CEGoals realize economic impact leads deaths well, right? question deciding deaths economic impact outweigh immediate deaths covid.  Sadly Florida recall initiatives. Gotta wait November 2022 vote out, January 2023 actually see back him. Stay classy Karen  lot guys know poorest (i.e. black s) going die greater numbers. genuinely care long black voters die.

I wish kidding.   bizarre word would using

insane...insane fits reflection much better wish, im actually undergrad. got publications guess im entitled call astrophysicist. Facts? talking polling children. people realize actually enjoy single time staying home, Pandemic simply accelerates trend though, divorces bound increase time anyway. makes doubly dumb. could really ""war time hero"", told people wear masks, continued enforce defense production act run supplies. Instead exact opposite. honestly know deliberate indifference, like, die die, he's really dumb. Sad thing deaths lag behind cases cases deaths likely going follow. SQWAK!!! OBAMACARE SUCKS! SQWAK!! linked pictures 7 day rolling average increasing increasing, somehow doubting is?

You mean slight bump supposed coincide middle massive surge deaths increasing. US close hitting 1k again, better treatment options compared before.

Sure. Things still ""March"" levels hard understand you’re braindead American, one! 

Bist du dir da gaaanz sicher? CVS desperate gambler losing streak reduced double-or-nothing every bet.  certain trust India TV news authority this? Well yeah, information asymmetry towards China problem USA.

But see countries taking note China implementing bits feasible country successful. know fashionable example Italy since one Chinese expert team went Italy publicly told Italian government lockdown soft hardened want turn ship around, got better.

But instead would like point Australia. actually look Victoria right control outbreak:

* movement restriction

* super hard lockdown apartment blocks center outbreak, complete armed guards 24/7 around it

* mandatory mask wearing

* 14 day quarantine incoming traveller, Australian nationals allowed Australia

* travel state border completely banned heavily restricted

It's straight China's playbook, despite Australia shit talking China. Thanks. September timeframe seemed touch miraculous given everything I’ve read vaccine development point longer process, plenty potential disappointment failure step. Reasonable reaction.....

Hell, I’m mid 40’s gluten intolerant 😭 agree would worried long term effects, virus general. slightly comforting parent though see already seemed get somewhat handle treating parent Illinois I'm also praying remote start. There's good come this. What? country controlling borders? RACIST say idea feels like brink death, act tough one minute cry like baby next You’ve shifted argument away point wrong. asked millions dead now. Millions dead lockdown.

You’re right, let’s assume anything take know. know roughly 4 million cases 150k deaths. take death rate apply entire US population, that’s 11 million dead. doomsday scenario, based know. 

Your belief get virus whether lockdown that, belief. It’s backed evidence. Don’t shift argument away idiotic original comment. US 1/4 India's population produce 60K cases one day, shocking India producing 40K cases one day? I'm confused. understand police would involved. Like 1 parent stopped following rules others wanted press charges? deliver meals hospital, Job sucks, company sucks, Hazard pay, I'm doin it. something. people going ER really (for non-Covid things) scared exposed Covid there. people can't get ICU bed ICU full Covid patients... etc... okay, die Covid Covid taken local ER/ ICU might still alive. It’s still relatively new virus. I’m taking precautions, worst thing could happen I’m wrong. what. NJ vaccuum months months away pandemic ending Cool cool. Nice way dismiss death someone’s 9-month-old baby. sure phrase ""thinning herd"" flew brain. Seoul densely populated NYC??!!😲
Jeez, know this.. joke look difference president born poverty, excelled school human rights lawyer worked fight corruption. polar opposite trump. would stop counting wouldn’t many negative, wasted two weeks, may come contact again. wasted entire month.  Man hit nail head...... fucking excuse saying masks work Faucci ass kissers fuck hard. lied ass wither keep job still LIED masks fuck him.... imagine said ware anything mask beginning would probably now. reason Purpose fuck economy fuck American public standard now. None windows schools district open. new buildings bullet proof, wire mesh, glass stuff. Maybe schools get pass exterior doors everywhere something similar. honestly can't say, beyond windows classrooms open. 

Maybe like plane one window popped escape? single window open kind exterior air movement needed potentially aid mitigation spread sars2.  working major pharmaceuticals prepping mass distribution rollout months now. AstraZenica even contact particular vaccine. Goddamn it, postpone frivolous bullshit emergency ""There’s reason walking around mask. you’re middle outbreak, wearing mask might make people feel little bit better might even block droplet, it’s providing perfect protection people think is. And, often, unintended consequences — people keep fiddling mask keep touching face.""

I'm pretty sure say mask effective. Basically, could give someone false sense perfect protection.

""Of course, course. But, think masks, think health care providers needing people ill. people who, **when look films foreign countries see 85% people wearing masks — that’s fine, that’s fine. I’m it. want it, that’s fine**.""

Basically supports wearing masks. Oh wow, Japan! You’re gonna fine LOL would think German would easier Japanese, experience either. 

I think comes desire learn. friend strange circumstance kind learn it, sense, it’s something look forward to. you’re even little eager learn might make easier. think also thought wouldn’t hard, background, struggle feels significant, suppose. 

How like Japan? Fucking crazy Florida nothing new here, expected. Remind me! 6 weeks us stuck here. Send help! hand, laid AI job, plenty time landscaping/housekeeping/elder managing, etc. Open bars clubs people go there. Blame whoever's allowing places open. Actually did. fact black plague still thing founding country social distancing invented combat Black Plague. 

Maybe crack history book someday It’s literally job. swear one knows anything works. need bring back civics class crying loud.

Here read this, know links help answer question.

 

**COVID-19 Cause Loss Smell, Scientists Finally Discovered smell taste validated COVID-19 symptoms patients high recovery   said study demonstrated high prevalence unique   presentation certain sensory impairments patients positive   COVID-19. reported loss smell taste, loss   typically profound, mild. encouragingly, rate recovery   smell taste high occurred usually within two four  weeks  infection.

""Among Covid-19 patients smell loss, 70 percent  reported improvement smell time survey   reported improvement, many diagnosed recently."" dont trust 'them' either live U.S. FAQ says yes, compensation. they? Assuming you’d still want maintain social distancing, many students could fit one? school 900 I’m interested seeing much would cost. Split teachers definitely regional. school surveyed 90% wanted return NY. guess many Florida schools surveying 90% not. Add political aspects well. really vary are. hear that!  Imagine believing Chinese reporting numbers... ""Hey Greg go piss pants again.""

That like 8 years ago asshole

""*people forget*"" FAQ says yes, compensation Thank replying disagree instead downvoting moving like everyone else. think consequences would much greater nothing let businesses die en masse enacting businesses put employees unnecessary danger. said opposite happening. Edit...words..  hope [Florida Smirked New York’s Virus Crisis. Great. Thanks Wow shown vaccine led making antibodies!

Seriously though great news whole package really built either optimism would another package later virus would downward swing now. response designed many see obvious, us before: there's back normal vaccine large enough degree pop virus died slow spread. Months late, I'm happy finally happened. Hopefully see people actually wear mask Patriotic instead saying silly things like ""The Deep State finally got him."" sure country much data anyway. much “data” Florida Texas need? ""102 rooking numbers.""

Florida probably words, vanishingly unlikely anyone 19 die this. Yeah know, IIRC given point 9 days total collapse, give start telling us send kids back school something comparable heroes act pass. exist loud won’t shut inflates perceived numbers. cost, close level removing entire support network months end. That's point. agree way late. he's worn one, want see excuses know still anti-maskers. everyone take vaccine wont 100% effective. Lol China unreliable, US worse that. fuck badly. expected US fuck given entitlement people American exceptionalism. see fucked ever imagined. World leader shithole. There's crime shootings killings list priorities I'm damn LA editor .com bubble actual value company lot lower expected value. Similar gambling choose one bankrupt Ugh worked immunology long broadly:

Innate immunity invertibrate animals (I think except octopus...). infers basic immunity cant deal things like new viruses. bog standard cells like macrophages, dendritic cells, eosinophils (dont worry actually are)

In adaptive immunity body uses things like cells B cells. B cells ones produce antibodies (to ""paint"" virus bacteria) cells (broadly) cells kill it. 

Adaptive immunity required kill coronavirus. Becuse brand new virus (for people) body isnt used to, requires cells come along, recognise activate B cells killer cells help kill it. Essentially animal without adaptive immunity would fucked coronavirus. 

A note: explained really badly might incorrect science, since postdoc immunology mostly autoimmunity (and actually dont even much standard grade/higher biology im good people field were) People still taking shit seriously enough. Preserving small businesses prioritized public health. People ""need"" haircuts get hair done. imagine states anti-mask people told old people would die... like sweeping Makes sense. MO one worst ranked public education systems country. ah thx ah thx irony UK already pre ordered 90mil doses yet undeveloped vacancies pfizer US pharma co's. Dip shit politicians sent cash Oxford defence Trump, UK killed anywhere 45,000 60,000 (depending choose read excess deaths daily reported figures). nation five times less populous America (65 millionish 330 millionish), we've done twice bad you, death wise.

I ain't excusing inflated oompa loompa, guys bad us wrong. 1/13 Black americans born sickle cell disease (which 7.6%). 

So make “very likely”. People don’t like racist people, make data try pass fact. Study Spanish Flu. concerning.  parent wants send kid back school unknown time, parent first place. US fully 25% worlds cases. part MAY due screening, likely much want claim. stands reason child infant cases going spike, would worlds biggest hot bed. hey.. lets another rally fight something see happens. facts here, desperate coverup attempt election almost voted executive powers emergency.

I guess easier obey fat guys smeared makeup number cases. Suppressing number deaths. would penicillin viruses. would change world. NHL right imo. They're setting bubbles Edmonton Toronto, planning fining teams taking away draft picks, player caught leaving bubble. 


Being cities mass testing, worries using public supply either, since it'll private tests. Latest round testing yielded 2 positive cases, bodes well all. 


Players leave Wednesday, they'll quarantine week, followed daily testing. would want nosebleeds watching baseball right now. way pathogens travel high places means would showered everyone behind you.

At top would fine. means system better hiding numbers. thought NC already announced school plans? something change? Well Murphy also keeping us Phase 2 reopening top anything. deff avoid second lockdown Hooray people living politically oppressed countries! forth, brave space monkey. Numbers usually lower Sun Mon. NAFTA list? congratulations Charles Darwin.  win again. religious schools Texas meet minimum standards education? people rent forgiven better get back pay thousands thousands apparently threw drain. Ok changed subject reason. topic response? Virus discovered December 2019 even 7 months verge vaccine.

This going eradication smallpox terms health care achievements. 9 times 10, woman want stuck house 9 months continues going work living life free avoid going insane. parents (men women) excited drop kids daycare means one, kid getting socialization needs two, yeah, fucking nice time - work related not. sounds like whole man make decisions personal thing gives comfort. Cool anecdotal evidence. realize America 330 million people right? I'm saying people exist. majority. surely people conflating England UK, arguing here, problem? sound like bitter anglophobe. Ty confidence, doom gloom crowd cannot listen reason. COVID airborne transmissible, kill everyone love, dare anyone take gravely seriously. new evidence cause male infertility could way impactful “just” deaths.  force governor's states worry took control ever Lol conservative conspiracy theorists never shut actually get resolved week two election...  Let’s hope finnish thing off, all. many doses Trump ordered? Or, assume they'll sent magically? another day Spanish flu 2.0. someone towering ego back something like yeah live here. mention untenured teacher fired automatically. Yes. Amazing Trump bad sane competent republican seems like anomaly. US: 35.71 people per square kilometer.

UK: 275 people per square kilometer.

I might retarded here, saying expect UK 9 times higher due us 9 times populated square kilometer, two times higher, America much worse?

If I've totally missed point, please feel free call retardery explain  Signed up. Couldn’t drive around thing wanted to? high risk people vaccinated start opening right? Seems like finish line close *Say what?* I’m presidents represent me! *Say what?* I’m dead fuckin presidents represent me! Thanks heads up, I'll keeping eye out. I'm teacher want know heck planning point. think already are. It’s either us China. made really sad. People selfish kill people without even knowing. Another tool toolkit! brazenly obvious world's worst epidemic right India. must missing tens thousands cases every single day -- hundreds deaths -- country 1.35 billion people. U.S. must urgently impose travel ban India beginning ease EU travel ban, given reciprocity -- addition epidemiological situation -- key factor EU end travel ban U.S. travelers. hold malice towards India, clear epicenter pandemic moved Asia Europe Americas South Asia. insane Indians travel United States every single day without even quarantine requirement extreme vetting airport. must impose travel ban Indian travelers NOW.  Cool...so whats status next day results tests teachers school staff? Well..this upsets me. Even state that, late, handled virus better, id hope educators would voice reason err side caution. 

My question would question posed? “return school normal” survey, suggestions digital learning giving students/families choices each? 

Id hope teachers regions handled pandemic better could see school could worsen area, teachers areas handled well could see schools could spiral completely control. hope sets would value students lives want put risk. hope can, that’s vaccine supposed do... apps even gather information. save changing random bluetooth id devices around device, cloud government server. receive data send them. dangerous privacy leaving bluetooth wifi controller enabled. I'm old enough know bullshit liars say didnt even claim point sick letters show mail diagnostic testing companies informing tested positive test never took.

Shame encouraging lies. old you? Surely got hacked lmao. Sounds like someone Reddit mocking him. worse thing over. still people say kind Government conspiracy. seen house cards? windy? Yeah. LOT ppl wear masks wrong.

It's better nothing, effective right way. ""More Americans eye move Canada ~~COVID-19 cases~~ Fascism surge US"" I’m huge believer UBI there’s inherent issue also see $600 weekly unemployment. Certain parts country getting $600 week like hitting lottery. parts, barely makes ends meet. Im well lol Wellll.... fuck right Oof that's rough deal. would teacher want work state? Love data! Hate I'm Triad health region. numbers high, seem lots resources, like beds ventilators such.

I really appreciate state becoming transparent continuing provide us information could clearly go opposite direction wanted. Florida going million cases 2-3 weeks rate. That's insane Yes higher rate kids signing virtual +cases rise. Though remember surgeon general who's telling everyone masks work wear one get wrong die. extend quickly people like completely utterly fucked. I've trying hard find job since lost mine got covid months ago nobody within area experience hiring places hiring pay little require manual labor longer due lung damage....from covid. previous job lied promise rehire recovered. I'm fucked I'm beyond stressed beginning feel suicidal Side note, also check goodrx

I basically gave using UHC insurance rx. saying ""smart move!"". really expect majoriy inner city Baltimore children enabled encouraged log zoom classes? Well, US, Trump Administration find away try fuck up, **GUARANTEE** you. data, including case numbers, reported directly NC Department Health Human Services, addition whatever national agency requests it. states believe. anyone's interested emailing Gov Trust US government plummeted unimaginable degree. Thanks Trump... oh many government officials lying right.

Get rid fools America! makes sense factor he’s taking orders Putin. Yeah makes sense stops wealthy hoarding vaccine?  UK setting new record vaccine speed run. sounds like parody statement. Wild. Great article thanks, forward friend Asthma “healthy” people wearing masks. Five months. got started late. Trump briefed January. full swing February. America, get excited. matter time Trump Administration starts trying prevent happening along spewing nonsense army eat up. Dumbest first world problem ever:

I like traveling, one month pandemic got one Delta’s fancy AMEX cards insane upfront annual fee could get perks, lounge, extra points. Needless say, flying till knows when. Idk already stories players breaking ""bubble"" get fast food bring girls. Also, teams Florida one worst places world far covid spread goes. works I'm confident major professional sport work. That's fair point, I'll even edit post reflect this. Still, cant help feel time theres contrary opinions apocalypse scenario theres downvotes aimed they're even voiced. Sorry keeping up. Glad well! Yep. really, really easy look others privileged position cushy high paying job know struggle working shitty McJob (or multiple shitty McJobs) try make ends meet. doubt appreciate someone telling work one places lost job. context gif? Lol I'm sure probably works way average. wife would died get two units blood hurry hemorrhaging, always recommend hospital. USA done use USPS deliver mask every house hold... Yeah conspiracy nut guy, suspect data manipulation state. check numbers every day find hard believe today, instance, 554 new cases. 

Based social media feeds, caution fatigue full effect. one gives fuck anymore. Hugging, drinking, working together, dining time. wearing masks. adding up. I'd guess take 554 multiply 3 get real number. be! None deaths happening right necessary. poor family! dropped like week announcing. Fortunately. Check Facebook back April-May. Plenty posts open everything up, stop living fear, govt. controlling you. ol' Covid denier talking points. Use pharmacy insurance sucks legitimately best helping get good cash prices. Almost switched pharmacies. Glad to. thing keep thinking about. Hang there. I'd take zinc vitamin C. Make sure getting tough sleep too.

You might get even do, great odds ok. might even get symptoms. Darwin. I'm trying civil reddit, getting angry yelling people doesnt get us anywhere. 

So true. America polarized even political discussions days. agree temporary stay idea; economy much worse without extension aid better whatever takes pass it. Oh yeah, here's full interview

""LaPook, March 8: There’s lot confusion among people, misinformation, surrounding face masks. discuss that?

Fauci: masks important someone who’s infected prevent infecting someone else… Right United States, people walking around masks.

LaPook: You’re sure it? people listening really closely this.

Fauci: …There’s reason walking around mask. you’re middle outbreak, wearing mask might make people feel little bit better might even block droplet, it’s providing perfect protection people think is. And, often, unintended consequences — people keep fiddling mask keep touching face.

LaPook: get schmutz, sort staying inside there?

Fauci: course, course. But, think masks, think health care providers needing people ill. **The people who, look films foreign countries see 85% people wearing masks — that’s fine, that’s fine. I’m it. want it, that’s fine.**

LaPook: lead shortage masks?

Fauci: Exactly, that’s point. could lead shortage masks people really need it."" think police time off? ☠️ far many people number happens personally.  problem used technical term among lay audience. try avoid future prevent confusion. unclear much virus spread caused asymptomatic transmission though, it?

If 80% virus spread caused asymptomatic carriers obviously good make masks obligatory; however, 1% spread caused asymptomatic carriers masks make much difference (assuming social distancing recommendations followed). Yes, point exactly. need class learning algebra.

I guess different schools thought, questionable many engineering jobs around future due variety factors.

How job prospects / outlook particular branch engineering? lot decent-paying jobs North America?

Would worth taking student debt go field in? outlook good enough? think? high-risk pregnancy, home birth safer option even there's pandemic! fact, that's Britain RECOMMENDS high risk. may get it. may infect parents grandparents. parents grandparents may miss work, hospitalized, lasting chronic disease die. economic consequences reverberate generations. kids may also get sick, lower rate. guess I'm misanthrope, I've *known* terrible average person is. People would get mad expressed thought people, realize right along. benefit doubt. require masks. Oh no. now, Piggly Wiggly. /s Speak yourself.

Our local theater leather recliners served full dinners, alcohol, theater.

It awesome, went time.  always tell good science “we don’t need test it. already know it’s true.” That’s totally good science works.

Then throw cognitive dissonance, anyone questions goes ad hoc category (“apologist!”) lets mentally eliminate concerns without ever addressing them. Ah, got it. recall reading something sort ""universal virus vaccine platform"" development several months ago, unrelated mRNA. Perhaps mixing mRNA vaccines?

I tried Google find it. mean, NASCAR fans last 4 races. Indycar last 2 races. NHRA last weekend weekend. guy fucking legend Another really good point. Often, classrooms exterior school even windows. know large local highschool classrooms windows. exterior windows line hallways around building. rooms internal. Oh stop vague blame GOP Lol - that's literally said, said think would ever even need take - would irrelevant May everyone would wearing masks. Yeah, situation pretty unthinkable considering we've months observe what's working what's regions, also prepare could happen. protections mostly worthless since sue enforce them, could squatter well. non paying tenant less likely destroy property squatter. landlords perspective, two equivalent. Except one guaranteed isn’t. Downgrading risk guaranteed non-guaranteed worth increase insurance premiums Nope, antibody test. almost exactly 2 weeks ago sat car whole time 25 minutes later doctor came negative test result. sure new test administered mine wrong, that's went doctor sign negative result. Idk things. Criminal charges? NYC densely populated  Lots hate towards public sector unions days, really union trying get protection essential workers. Strange coming crowd needs guns overthrow government oppress them. guess fine violently revolt trying negotiate government limits I’ve heard early 2021 general population.

Edit: article literally says early next year best case scenario. They’re giving healthcare workers first.   vaccine isn’t totally new. already developed Sars1 Mers, ”simply” changed payload sars2. 

This type vaccines high tech, Oxford’s ChAdoX-platform really works, humanity never wait years develop vaccines. probably begin fathom big is. it’s actually physical mask them, that’s convenient excuse. It’s idea mask. transmit others, that’s problem. die it, it’s safe. not. voted ardently every district survey summer. many vulnerable populations employed attendance schools. district decision yet school year, doesn’t start late August, would assume fully online.

But like said, teach high school kids generally independent enough online could work long teachers available modify differentiate based student needs (communicated needs one one support give already anyone asks it, specific structured supports legal things like IEPs 504s also support systems place beyond staff members). know elementary aged kids completely different matter, socialization skills structured play focus work—like said, I’m build curriculum kid right now. microcosm situation saying regard public school: preschool parent-participation one parents keeping kids home, wasn’t enough money operate, keep building, teacher, fold. thing public school faces: students withdraw, less public funding given year, tightens budgets often forces RIFs (reduction force layoffs) even students return following year, snowballs bigger classrooms, fewer supports, fewer options opportunities, etc. district going even fall’s situation likely make worse. teacher, it’s scary. I’m high enough generally seniority list—having taught ten years—but I’m legitimately concerned could find laid next years since goes seniority. can’t even begin imagine losing job I’ve loved poured decade.

But anyway, it’s ugly place be. taken seriously last months, wouldn’t need don’t need get politics “what if” reality facing distance learning again. Like said, teachers prepare deliver best fall, even online. Keeping kids enrolled using curriculum they’ve already built means tax money still goes school teachers don’t lose jobs. 

My husband floated idea sending middle high schools online, using campuses well existing elementary campuses divide classes even smaller elementary classes space provide six-foot distancing mandatory masks, course. even don’t know extra teachers going come budgets can’t afford already, would even mitigate risk teachers given kids going lot harder keep mandates. even then, they’ll basically tied desk unable really socialize anyway (unless something like suggesting pods, everyone signs agreement interact one kids class teacher) someone gets sick what’s protocol?

I don’t answers. I’m administrator honestly don’t know ever want hahaha whole situation logistical nightmare without strict governmental guidance oversight based scientific data research, importantly funding—the mixed messaging “schools must reopen” it’s important society blatant “fuck figure don’t like answer aren’t even going give *normal* funding” shows value isn’t education—it’s allowing working people continue cogs machine lines rich pockets.

Sorry. didn’t want get political. Hard to. anyway, option might keep kids public schools, use distance learning, support communicate teacher, supplement pod that’s you’re set doing. you’d supporting system teacher valued person, supporting school attendance funding directly impact teacher form, also get benefit socialization, even aren’t class, certain flexibility likely exist, obviously supplement shared instruction whoever intend pay.


This really easy situation navigate, dialogue really helpful me, allowing articulate thoughts, defensive, also getting consider parents like facing end too. Good luck you, I’m happy continue conversation continue support. article says mass NEXT YEAR. Whoever made September rumor idiot. child. bother slightest. least worries fall. already is. Us Canadians pretty horrified. “Greatest mask deniers”. 🤣🤣

Bahahahahahahahaha! Y’all, cannot. He’s talking like dolts walk around yelling “freedoms” restricted masks held “high regard” anyone...y’all laughing stock *literal world* right dumb realize it. Ok pretend exactly happened hydroxychloroquine proved dangerous increase risk death covid. mention idiots went started taking without doctors got sick it. mean ""unlike united states""? Every state around me, own, requiring masks. guys need research posting blatant lies.  Oh, USA leading behind. Far depend upon Americans right thing. exhausted every possibility.

-- Winston Churchill comments:

""I necessary protein chain, substituted fish broth oregano. Turned horrible! I'd give zero stars could!"" Unpopular opinion - USA absolutely botched lockdowns corralling people grocery stores. 

Grocery stores obviously unsafe places due poorly circulated air crowds. 


If want lockdown work, (1) ration trips limit frivolous inefficient shopping, (2) encourage home delivery. 


No need non-market Wuhan method cheap food delivered block centralized authority, method works too. right need negative test result stay hotel etc. states. Nothing like NH afaik. Good news around vaccine front. Oxford, moderna Pfizer good results far know novavax j&amp;j candidates - although months behind - promising well. Fingers crossed we’ll 1-2 legit vaccines end year. I've calling Maskholes. people use bathroom restaurant? flush toilet? toilet lid it?

Flushing toilet causes virus go airborne toilet plume, subsequent flushing makes move around spread more. 

I would want building unrelated people share toilets. think underrated hazard. hate you. Sorry bud, trying provide little life tip. take it. Americans believe vaccine part effort alter DNA implant microchips body

Where hell finding people?? give recipe everyone? saying guys picking random shit floor causing divorce &amp; blaming ""depression""?

GTFO idea trying say.  woman raging Donna Shalala? saying I'm woman dared leader? assure I'm neither woman leader.  don’t need look back “someday”.

I look back like *now*. picture cute cat getting coronavirus vaccine might genuinely break internet think would considered eligible physiology/medicine prize. supposed given there's covid related Nobel prize likely given discovery virus itself. Yes. let sub sensationalist bullshit alter fact Jared Kushner charge Operation LightSpeed stocks several firms manufacturers drug yet called safe skyrocketing. ever seen product service commodified get better overall? No. 

Wait solid information first, first calf needle tit, especially current administration office. That's herd immunity actually works, without knowing long base immunity could 99% still problems road. great news That's called leadership find America let know. Well US ability. leader country want enablers legislative branch let way. Yeah Nobel prizes awarded political matter. arent used that's sure. Luckily ramped common sense every part world one. Normal vaccine: small dose deactivated/dead virus/proteins produces injected system provoke immune system creating immune response. Basically getting infected baby version virus. also explains side effects (low fever, headache). 

m(essenger)RNA vaccine: wizard shit can't explain I'm smart enough read harvard site (http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/rna-vaccines-a-novel-technology-to-prevent-and-treat-disease/) someone else bigger brain comes along ELI5 this

sends magic stuff cell, produces antigen basically ready fire needed. 

The advantages seem effective, safer, faster provide flexibility. apparently changing one virus next one difficult anymore. 

I guess that's says would change way view infectious disease. According wikipedia could also used cancer. long redemption arc? Caribbean saying :( 3 years... vaccine testing EU.  Dude, that. Like whole thing already a, shit show add on?? feels great wake instead seeing post Florida Texas US huddled inside; scared, angry, saying things like “How get bad?”

Violent, armed morons staying home reflecting? see it. already ""know"" blame. rather expect anger fear result increasing violence who/what-ever blame. Honestly, make federal mandate dare courts (correctly, course) deem unconstitutional pandemic. would amazing, read article, researchers honest still preliminary results work/time needed.

It’s fascinating read process.

The way I’m looking it, think we’re going limbo next year so. 2022 think enough us vaccinated bring risk some. read article, find stark differences schools, schools went to.

&amp;#x200B;

In High School, 95% day spent inside building (expect occasional outdoor Gym class \[most Gym classes Gymnasium, though\]) building 0 windows could open. 95% day inside, classrooms 30 students (usually 1-2ft away eachother). 

&amp;#x200B;

I always heard Flu illnesses really spread school systems, infect parents, get really sick. pandemic, first saw spread Adults vacation (Chinese New year... Christmas... etc) disease spread across globe, going gather children together less month places -- spread virus around bring home parents sick yet.

&amp;#x200B;

GG.

GLHF.

\#IMSTAYINGHOME2020 Can't wait watch videos Americans freaking taking .. 
Popcorn ready .. is* month 1 sub-year 7 2020. Good Lord. yep he's guy. ego next political fight, course, whether get vaccine. That's going really, really, really interesting. way Russian one. they're democracies opinion null proxy one-state specific thing. 

It really is.

Again, else explain Florida's cases?

Florida's cases/per 1M massive, highest country.

Requiring masks (not statewide) July pandemic started Feb/March...

Sure, better late never. get kudos bare minimum 4 months late side effects? fear people gets vaccine symptoms, others would want get shot. imagine older people saying: ""no, I'm perfectly healthy get fever shot, would want risk it?"". know might way, especially want achieve herd immunity, convincing older people (who ones risk) less educated people get vaccinated could difficult. cant. constitution. Unless write amendment. changed mine new ones fucking spoilers made flip around much wind.

Goodluck! Dude sounds scary AF safe keep mask !! US number 1 many things! Leading world Coronavirus Anti-vaxxers! Sweden failed experiment, two super low case numbers. Agree. Hell, bipolar, didn’t sleep 3+ months since began triggered manic phase (finally got med switch good there), still can’t imagine lashing people like that. Amusingly, edited deleted really nasty comments make look victimized. patience people like that. Nobel peace prize different Nobel prizes. yes, Nobel peace prize joke. headlines days ago. ironclad enough viruses cannot mutate? wouldn’t trust rankings St Andrews. gets much higher satisfaction approval rating universities it’s free Scottish students make majority students there. 

I’d say top 3 UK unis international rankings like QS &amp; RoundRanking (Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial College) pretty standard ranking UK unis. Didint say shoot good news

GOOD NEWS: Vaccine train immune system. Shows good promise.

FALSE NEWS: Vaccine able end year covid next year.

STUPID NEWS: RUINGING GOODFEELING DONT WANT KNOW IM BURNED ALIVE!!! I'm tired life dictated employer. figure better situation due time.

At end day, bottom line would dictate. someone else's profits. one brainwashed friend, think Chinese government model emulate. One corners started existing vaccine took ""key"" initial disease handed ""key"" SARS-CoV-2, much testing already completed started. Yeah  soon vaccine ready. 'Covid19 vaccine rolls general public except United States working vaccine Trump claims bigger better best vaccine since one created years ago, would quicker daft democrats stopping great work we're doing, availible everyone, very, soon, greatly soon reasonable price way $1000 wanted it'. Sorry informing you?   going kill someone's grandma Kid-putting-stick-in-his-bike-spokes.jpg sorts massive salaries paying PPP monies? happens let nature take course instead looking whether relationship work practically. response sounded false reasonable me, like finding loophole sign order, trying make seem like government overreach. asked report went hospital. could show hospital, report sitting waiting room. bad enough report, medical staff would her. people would listen clever people reason small business work remained open ""landlord"" letting make payments rent.

It's double edged sword, business picking back obviously need customers make money. also need everyone stay fuck home. LOL. dont disingenuous. well know doctors, etc wearing cotton bandana calling mask.

If everyone N95 stance would different. dudes face thong shit. Unlike US, countries ran pathetic reality tv toddler. good news is, 70% chance fever headaches bit concern? Seems bit steep.

[Edit] downvotes? Really? I'm willing bet money we'll SOMETHING available American public November. 

The problem given current administration, may end ""barely better placebo"" vaccine that's rammed FDA get something time election. 

That's (future) conspiracy theory. There's absolutely correlation narcissism ignorance. believe correlation understanding privilege ignorance. shy away saying lack intelligence because, truly think understand, CHOOSE to. family member legitimately said understand issues hand (and extent believe them) exist reality, treat everyone equal (and extent believe them. Three issue still believe saying lives matter actually causing larger rift continuing point differences; believe unity harmony way past this. problem 1) yes need unity, white allies, issue unique POC need call spade spade (I hope expression carry context I'm unaware of); 2) happen within reality, happen them; 3) ever focus things ""part reality"" we're essentially saying fight black people alone: fight system white people setup continue perpetuate. 

We (white people) huge responsibility stand beside fellow humans (and amplify voices, replace them). think issue responsibility challenge, even family member says racist, perpetuate racism, treat everyone same, feel responsible problem, thus, responsible solution. also challenge also explain family member that, lack action continued silence perpetuating problem ultimately leading treating others differently. Silence/ignorance still part problem.

And even address micro aggressions as, calling blank friend ""brother"" taking black person's hair defining features.

Anyway, that's minor rant there's direct correlation ignorance narcissism maskers Anti lockdowners, Anti BLM people even ignorant ALM people Moderna Cambridge, starting phase 3 trials end July. vaccine produced antibodies 45 people. also think US invested heavily Oxford vaccine. FTFY:

Terrorists. many doses made? many syringes?? read comment yesterday's Oxford post it'd take 2 years properly distribute thing even get vaccine September situation still quite dangerous November so.

Well want negative, good finally hear this, fingers crossed Phase 3 goes well.  least state people wearing masks, occasional person see angrily walking back car grab one allowed inside store. Missouri minus politics bad. Lots lakes, Kansas City great. sold St Louis, there's stuff worth seeing too. Branson touristy locals probably worst state. 

Up north Mark Twain stuff, Hannibal wineries things. Hermann neat. St Genevieve cool too. 

Missouri terrible unless engage politically locals. Sweden still racking 100-800 cases per day conditions 'defacto lockdown' aka Swedish summer vacation. caseload lessening, resins may so. Another thing mostly young people get whose symptoms may mild may bother get tested. Young people primary cohort also explains declining hospital rates / death rates. Another thing weather, although cooler recent weeks still within pleasant Nordic summer weather lets people spend time outside. 

The claim Carlsson made resting totally unproven idea twice many antibodies cell immunity. know all, *no* antibody studies random samples indicate Sweden anywhere near herd immunity. Yeah buddy. good stuff. needed boost start week. Correct, means aren’t 100% confident unless perform tests. confident tests would superfluous. Old news, move something new? WW3 maybe? lot disagreements scientific world whether spike mutation made virus infectious, everyone agrees made less deadly. clinical presentation same. study suggested infectious based spike study, experimenting actual virus. See Florida question - phase-3 trials complete September, vaccine announced provide protection COVID, I, non healthcare worker who's high risk virus, expect get vaccinated?

production distribution take quite time. even nearly enough glass vials earth vaccines need. 
people would need least two doses. would need more.  
A small measurable percent doses would damaged transport, small measurable percent would unusable reasons (contaminated, sloppy handling, etc). good amount would put stockpiles.  


So let's assume we'd need around billion doses, Americans.  


We make anything earth billion. even billion glass vials vaccines available. We're done building facilities needed process billions doses.  


Usually, vaccines made using live chicken eggs, that's going work - even process we'll need scope needed something never attempted.  


Johnson Johnson estimates billion doses could ready Q2 Q3 2021. even speak distribution.  


Look testing america. Like 25 million tests distributed country, absolute mess. swabs delivered walmart parking lots. We're talking billion glass vials delivered health care facilites similar providers equipped distributing vaccinations, they're contending peak pandemic.  


We simply never made distributed billions anything before, we're exactly displaying ability cooperate greater good. 

 Sadly, production distribution vaccine probably take longer production. numbers possibly tempered with. I'm arguing. supposedly Canadian.

What bizarre interaction. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Assuming compelling evidence effectiveness doubt would sustainable long. vaccine arrived think that's point overwhelming majority population decide risk minimal sufficiently acceptable return life normal. I've fully supportive efforts reduce spread Covid become tipping point efforts control spread become damaging Covid itself. think availability vaccine point given much effect Covid mitigated. collectively agree certain amount illness death viruses 'acceptable'. lockdown flu despite tens thousands deaths year (I'm saying Covid flu, I'm comparing Covid vaccine). people (particularly Reddit) claim even think normal life cases zero society every operated. said that, expect habits suspicious crowds instinctively social distancing continue time, people took seriously. Tell then, point listing article subreddit seemingly underscore OMG CORONA EVERY OMG DEADLY RIGHT???? people consistently respond whether they're alone group? mean, might majority, entirely rare either. supposed wired differently something? positivity rate increase though ""Dan Snyder coronavirus"" - Washington Post/Jay Glazer ""No one make mistake U.S.""

India: ""Hold Beer""  Thats great, let know. released past season, idea Yikes. really want vaccine. rushed mega manufactured Chinese one. Let’s hope still left country safe effective drugs.  Wonder who’s going pay it? Taxpayers?  

I see abused. cheating angry parents giving death threats 8 yr old got C test. needed extra money. Happened helicopter parents thinking kids get scholarships little league. mention number deaths... hmmm like metric truly matters goes ignored. Nothing strange there. Honestly, completely clueless Good  Yeah sign phase 2 clinical trial participant. 

Godspeed people rush get first vaccine. Let us know goes You’re getting downvoted, you’re alone there. ACA make people’s healthcare expensive. wasn’t better everyone, cause sizable backlash. 

But answer, said, isn’t getting rid go back way things were. answer NHS style healthcare system. 

Thing is, answer national healthcare system like UK has. people: LEtS OPen diSNeY, PRoBLeM CoRONavirUS. 
Same people: DoNT OpeN SCHoolS amID CoVId PAnDemIC 


Just sayin' haven’t close yet ? Oh no, children??? /s see lot comments justifying Modi's lockdown measures. actively denying Coronavirus like Trump, passive slow spread.

The case covid India collective action central government. leaving states fend problems, less support them. huge release package gas bogus show like actions. cases high, also massively underreported. central action get enough tests PPE suffering states (which almost them). places rules allow reporting news paints govt 'bad light' several journalists charged 'crimes'.


It also help country going severe economic crisis. forced govt partially open country, helping case.  seem legit, never would give experimental vaccine elites, would give first prisoners etc. real? Results back less 24hrs (in Canada) that's I'm afraid - force everyone start getting vaccinated unproven yet fully tested vaccine require every working American get vaccine go back work (all expense course government can't afford pay vaccines people, duh!)

My fear people start dying untested vaccine still force people get shot mean, tried help. get it. cant make policy help US citizens I'd imagine. Weinstein probably consume enormous amounts baby souls keep alive time. clearly didn’t get point. 

I responding guy claiming government police *lazy*. 

I wearing fucking mask, Legault pushing responsibilities business owners precisely avoid excessive policing law would trigger minority people like guy video.

We know can't, aren't. smart would sold maga masks $49.99 Good luck fucking tards wait round two Europe. Romania already estimating 1,000,000 infections September. 54% increase last week alone. Europe literally thinks ok travel long wearing mask social distancing. IIRC tested human test groups months already. member! plan quite simply, people knew understood screwed, chances uprising would increase dramatically, thus poor people distracted making fight system kills them. system based fear losing little got. president would say, system loves poorly educated. 30% higher 2018 flu season

You realize shit hit fan February/March got ""under control"" recently due many full lockdowns lasted 2 months. Hospitals overwhelmed patients sometimes transferred countries (France Germany). 

So 30% deadly (not sure number, I'll believe it) half time, 1/3 spent full lockdown nothing downplay.

Any signs slowing. havent reporters plain flat asked doing? actions counter intuitive unless want deliberately harm kill Americans. way makes sense. Interesting clarification, thank you! Another fun fact: USA **actually** uses forced labor produce face masks. Yes, course! :) worldwide, least us wish was.  Yeah, answer US crazy propaganda poured throats young age telling us America greatest lucky live best country world. American Italy throughout this, it’s like living bizarro dimension seeing people know post losing liberties something. Like yeah...the lockdown Italy sucked, got I’m pretty sure we’re living tyranny lol. We’re back living life less normally again. look though live apartment meth lab.  Americans weak? afraid admit covid real, afraid acknowledge climate change, afraid admit trump threat? think helps denial? afraid? nothing? pretend something isn’t happening? don’t ever want like that. heard Clintons running global pedophile ring pizza shop, Obama Muslim isn’t American, Democrats coming take guns, Sandy Hook fake, 9/11 done American government, etc. 

This falls line those. moron would believe it.

The Governor Florida barely thinks virus real. would try make look worse?

If anything proof under-reporting.  That's kinda point clinical trials UK population around 65 million, around 80% solely England. Perhaps show fact based restore it.  

Original research: problem weight 10 pounds mass I've lost last 4 months allowed go gym. Idiotic? Moronic?

Yes, governor more. Us locals fine let tourists again. plenty ""hoax"" crowd (there are), numbers tell story things bad tourists came. noticed truthers quieted down? need talking points. Gotta get Donnie make false claims use facts arguments. Instead know, looking statistics bodies piling stuff Agreed rental?

Tbh Astrazenca following organisation CEPI distribution. think it'll country country immunising full Country time it'll groups people ie 10m across world high risk category first like 2m US, 1m UK, 1m France 1m Brazil etc. whenever high risk epicenter ILI levels always extremely low summer months. makes Covid different. initially assumed type illness would fizzle weather got warmer seasonal illnesses behave. Keep mind: mRNA candidate Moderna also zooming along phase 3 trials (the data good, quite good Oxford). believe expect another 100 million doses EOY. everything keeps going well might position vaccinate 2/3 US EOY. Probably everyone mid-2021. time realizing viral particles surfaces low possibility spreading virus. “i’ve got big truck..”

We're barely hanging on. Please everyone upvote/share post. hear articles contradicting per political viewpoint. kind stuff needs top. Politics aside, reality news flooded cheap information causes information like never see light day. generation kids going suffer interruption education. landscaper's kid mowing lawns right now. feeling, go back school, go business dad landscaper life. respectable profession, course, feel like kid's opportunities artificially limited. He's kind kid anybody around going take interest seeing catches up. 

Probably lot kids going limited lifetime opportunities stemming pandemic. lot low-paid manual labor. kind thing motivate politician mislead pandemic dangers, especially somebody trying make happen somebody else's country. wonder misinformation comes from, look suspiciously people spread it. It’s make look totally incompetent you’re parts store parking lot, front Real Men especially teenage cashier already declined help from. pouring rain. hopelessly trying. failing.

Source: happened me. once. Cases nonsense due testing backlog. Deaths week week. understand (or likely understand) numbers looking at. small dip 7day due two low days caused weekend lag nothing write home about. speak point. fair, spent much/any time US, hard grasp huge spread country is. states well and/or competent, effective governors hardly make headlines.  addendum-again. article immunity, antibodies. You’re repeated use terms though interchangeable doesn’t bode well understanding topic discussing.  I'm sure staff thrilled. Might want longer term testing ir's distributed. Sadly list really fucking long know position I'm speaking?
I'm saying matter here, think important accurate grossly exxagerate. 

Compared countries poverty level certainly extreme. poverty US? Certainly. extreme? No. 

.6% USA lacks access clean water. Nigeria 30% country lacks access. Let's reasonable here. sounds like market rate full time preschool me...

I’m high COL area though that’s probably bit distorted. Excited see propaganda tactics they’ve come reopen schools. China must making fortune mask sales. confusing eradicating disease vaccination everyone earth 


The way Smallpox eradicated looking small outbreaks vaccinating everyone near outbreak. Also isolate anybody shows signs vaccinate them. 


Small pox also 30% death rate spreads much slower isn’t like Covid. 

It’s also disease that’s hundreds years. first recorded treatments 1400s China. Turkey African places also used similar treatments 1796 European scientist able make vaccine. took another 200 years eradicate disease plenty people already immune. agree disagree. OH GOD Probably save people Nobel Committee... mean nicest way I'm really trying rude, basic statistics. pretty straight forward sample size effects results study. [one Oxford](http://Oxford University Press › academic › ...
Sample Size Calculations Randomized Controlled Trials) calculate sample sizes vaccine trials way do. Since live US, much going cost me? guys REALLY think corporate america pay workforce happily go back shitty jobs make $$$$$? cost big corp next nothing. It'll worth everything. Yes would go get sick They're philistines charlatans. Oh sure. anything like yellow fever vaccine basically took couple paracetamol fine within two days. Basically like mild hangover. early last week Wake County moving away Plan B (hybrid distance/in person). school full distance 2020/2021.

I imagine schools move way. lot people asking coronavirus care routine decided make video tutorial share secrets! fairly well compared rest US Floridians. soon governor opened tourism, numbers spiked like crazy. Shocker. disagree things different. current state affairs. Drastic change takes time. get one HIV? maybe one already. 

Also note want COVID vaccine. Kemp race bottom. Different century though :)  earth would look like? Would we, like, inoculate neighborhood compare adjacent one?

It's matter opinion, find quickly based size inevitable second rise cases. PRAY MEME teachers. school staff. Eventually, long enough timeline, enough teachers school staff left remain open. Already debunked british PM far vaccine next year possible. bias all....

There’s literally difference Canadians Americans. watch programs, sports, play games. damn difference Tim Hortons. Provided terms side effects potential sugar pill control group provided, yes. 

My point trust China accurately communicate those. long documented history whatever serves best cutting corners wherever feel beneficial, even unsafe.

I'm trust country's ethical standards literally enslaving million Muslims. Rioting strengthens narrative protesters terrorists calling destruction violence turns protest coordinated attack. attract people cause riot well. gets control innocents suffer. Many itching fight want happen, supporting unconstitutional inhumane tactics deal easy see national threat. Coups happen would normally oppose supression impression emergency; need protect people yet play grander scheme gaining dominance slides slow. 

 better ways damage gum system starting war think many prepared handle repercussions of. Families already divided. need go last resort outright insurrection probably enough people side screaming. Plenty times they've back peddled faced insurmountable outrage. there's enough people willing riot revolt confidence numbers, there's plenty people boycott certain politicians monetary interests, find ways waste time, general pain ass extent cannot ignored. I'm sure people clever come even better ways.

 people refuse support upper class takes away foundations comes riots attacks gives freedom squash opposition violently.

We citizens last resort yet, stop fucking rioting. Sky horrible phone. Quoted six cluster symptoms everyone: 

1. 'Flu-like' fever - Headache, loss smell, muscle pains, cough, sore throat, chest pain, fever.

2. 'Flu-like' fever - Headache, loss smell, cough, sore throat, hoarseness, fever, loss appetite.

3. Gastrointestinal - Headache, loss smell, loss appetite, diarrhoea, sore throat, chest pain, cough.

6. Severe level three, abdominal respiratory - Headache, loss smell, loss appetite, cough, fever, hoarseness, sore throat, chest pain, fatigue, confusion, muscle pain, shortness breath, diarrhoea, abdominal pain. Man, I've missed show last ~~couple~~ weeks. that. give hope. links specifically cite SEVERE COVID CASES

OP said mom stuffy nose. 
Can actually read articles linking next time? Yet still news Breath Wild sequel smdh refused return work... 2 shitty jobs instead one. according keikaku! troubling, (AFAIK) Cytokine Storms prevalent stronger immune systems.

 Policy makers may assume ""healthier"" subpopulations greater likelihood recovering virus, make decisions put people harm's way. Then, damage done immune systems. American living Canada here. volunteer soup kitchens (or pandemic) helped charity clothing drives holidays homeless. Never asked anything system aside CERB, intend pay back taxes already pay into.

I state thump chest charitable person. show try right others. know *hell* lot good people back America would same. Maybe act high mighty paint 330 million people one monolithic personality. 

Oh, we're subject asshole behaviour, claiming person's place birth defines person, without considerations, probably *not* asshole behaviour.  really healthy spend 24/7 spouse added stress pandemic possible financial strain lot relationship. Don’t forget Spain UK. thought sure UK would tip scales bit since doctors nurses would crying English. I’ve UHC HMO 7 years, PPO blue cross 12 years...UHC really isn’t bad.

Yes no. Schools incredibly important outlet social service agencies reach kids, also place kids find consistent safety, even food. Going online education negative effect mental health whole generation. Click link AAP's position issue, take work it. 

I disagree AAP, however, recently published South Korean study strongly supports position. person school rapidly escalate pandemic *plague*, even worse everyone's mental health. again- key point ignore doctors peril. pediatricians telling us damage lot kids. need balance epidemiology, consider whether pediatricians given enough thought kid's mental health parents get sick grandparents die. stand whatever want to, you’re acting like proved point, objectively not. I’ll also ask article definitively say someone “infected again” scientific proof result false positive, false negatives between, reactivation (not reinfection) virus. 

If correcting incredibly false logic inflated opinion intelligence makes dumb, it. Imagine denied us access vaccine lulz Unlike United States, countries acknowledge COVID19 serious problem hoax. weird hill die on, okay Video, action around someone finally did.. Fuck guy orange fuck literally said week “I’ll right eventually” COVID going away. 

There enough people think like vote people still support him. would lovely. think it’s really good idea. Maybe build somewhere like DC NY? could also see built whichever city/state ends highest death count over.

Idk could ask something like citizens though? contact senators/representatives ask?

EDIT: idk I’m downvoted... say something offensive? Pretty much, whole debacle falls back decades. Bailout/Budget bills going everywhere except society improvements, lesser two evils, lack proper nationwide insurance. ever-increasing wage gap disparity brought today. “Doctor’s Hospital Renaissance” AKA DHR. Named fact owned doctors. won’t. timeline set Trump’a Operation Warp Speed. order get funding, proposal say would happen. worked. $2 billion OWS, got $1.2 billion. much money line, promised. 

This par course large government contracts. say make faster anyone else there’s little recourse government fail meet lofty goal. story told Russia following: One businessman needed work pandemic relatively weak health volunteered test subject, among commons ( mostly military personnel vaccine sponsored army ) got shot. vaccine passed phase 2 trial (or really phase 1 claimed article? phase 3 3th august?) ( many exaggerations - russian press looks sounds passed phase 3 somehow ), lot stretch one claim - actually 'proven' vaccine elite people took it. Important realize even hospitals great conditions, things like would playing out. people say many covid victims would died within year two anyway, may true, wouldn’t died alone scared. Wow US' poor handling COVID-19 happens result federal leadership + decades underfunding public education. 

It matter time. Masks dehumanise. Mask-wearing zombies human. Also, Mickey Mouse! That’s bad thought would new cases considering 2 weeks ago 4th expecting massive number seeing north people socially distancing. say, possible reduce symptoms. still win Jelly Stock time high! ^ Even cross, schools cant run even 75% staff. social distancing protocols put place already impossible situations, losing quarter teaching staff would force schools close.  Adam Silver take coronavirus task force? Another R-party fucking criminal. nothing else, pandemic shown close country always completely unraveling. fact assholes enough unchecked power DIRECTLY put people's lives danger based purely political agenda absolutely disgusting. available...just across street. Ridiculous. Lol Florida. John Oliver: intersections: talk them: there’s vaccine doesn’t mean everyone get it. still need lot poor people minorities die gonna solve worlds problems right? /s People decent job Columbus get rural areas it’s free happens really wonder Americans do.. cower accept (Fourth Reich style) actually prove land free? Sooo... mean, make quarantine mandatory least make civil lawsuit go partying actually suspecting positive? 

I'm Germany recently got tested. told ""You know, give really bad impression put quarantine tell partying getting tested coming ;-) better stay home, mkay?""

And that's did, got negative results. teach small town Saskatchewan Canada. easily get -40 celsius winter. snow around first week October, I'm afraid plan work am, might make sense Florida Texas southern states.

Are overweight threatened someone's bare face?

Chill, relax bit. anxiety paranoia reaction worse health covid.

""if want kill family""

Are ok? evangelicals, either. scariest thing Trump ""coalition"" enfolds hard-line Catholics, Orthodox Jews, even Hindus. Anybody super-religious spooked Muslims resentful effete ""elites"", really. Random question: sports safe open aren’t? Baseball seems relatively safe think. Figured Brits would pay us back Lend Lease eventually ego narcissism allow quit. He'd second president history quit. 

My biggest fear time election November inauguration January. He's still president time nothing lose. US tends enjoy peaceful transition power. fear go creating immense chaos. numbers go CDC whomever reporting them? North Carolina today reported decline cases. hope decline true, seems weird I've always wondered tbh  everywhere new rapid tests, extremely recently, rapid tests unreliable causing harm good. places using PCR tests take hours run - testing capacity prevent backlog long benefit testing produces data necessary study epidemiological aspects pandemic. founding fathers didn’t envision shutting country virus doesn’t shit 99% people either Breaking news: Vaccine vaccines do.

This great news though. i'd trust oxford one bc 5 years animal trials 2 years human trials behind it. would say, least oxford rushed much. least comes safety

someone correct i'm wrong long human trials. I'm incredibly frustrated behalf.

I'm sorry endure situation, hope parents eventually understand come safely. Ew. Omg still know people, dont think hoax think optional drug therapy end economy tanked purpose. Educated degrees high school education shaking head statements Nothing link contradicts said. actually posted ~3 weeks (prior this). hear - I'm avid watcher channel. vaccine 100% coverage, may enough make infection mild. reduces total number infections, help too. 

I think many people continue wear masks, least time, people conscious proximity others. given can't get people wear masks worst it, doubt wearing masks widespread things die down. fill seats dolls mean mannequins like Korea Underrated comment i.e. tests took weekend help let virus regroup? Id say public support would 50/50. dont know split teachers wouls similar, thats upsetting part. would hope endangerment students face would bring together. school systems stood together virtual learning, thats different story would fine alternative dont really see used full counter opening schools think sueing would waste precious time funds. close certain states. Like border control enterances state. people tend forget dead? website registered GoDaddy. would anyone put personal information link. Use official .GOV link - www.ClinicalTrials.gov

Here currently recruiting COVID-19 studies. called ""Chad""? pull couple others them.  worse people huddled inside get away cold?

I'm hoping fall/winter alleviate things south. Summertime, people crowd indoors get away heat. Fall lesser extent, winter preferable outings. hold breath. expose people coronavirus-2? part study. Along America, purchased 300 million doses month ago won’t though. Restaurants operating employees positive don’t care bc don’t wanna lose money. Lol what? Woah slow fuck start taking good news twisting conclusion Arizona committing outright fraud?

Hospitalizations trending downward could sending patients New Mexico. two situations mutually exclusive.  administration end things courts establish precedent things future. it’s something agree doesn’t mean you’ll agree future.  reports always say phrases like ""may"" ""could."" false negatives thing c19 tests, likely never cleared infection first place. concrete examples long term infections also. add known quantity symptoms ebbing flowing. me, seems we're looking chronic infection small percentage reinfections. also say possibility reinfection, that.

Another possibility simply statistical outliers. Every year flu causes weird things happen select people. nephrotic syndrome (kidney thing) kid doc's best guess flu kicked off. many people get nephrotic syndrome result hundreds millions flu infections every year?

nb - I'm saying fucking flu case goofball wants infer nonsense comment. I'm saying even known quantity like flu cause oddball shit. think could reinfections school.  post removed cannot verify reliable source.

They’ll get em. many things control good argument. tell Sweden don’t wear masks low rate said month ago running 10% positive. Everyone downvoted me. Maybe said less tactful. said something like, stupid shit.  Add people 30s getting kicked balls since 9/11. ok wear one medical condition prevents wearing one? USA reports anywhere near 24 hour turnaround. Especially morning announcements (Florida, Arizona among others).  right eventually 

\- Trump wallace interview Shhhhh.... think safe reopen fully again. quess so, better nothing right ? seem remember cultivating vaccines takes months requires lots raw materials lots space, 16 months hundreds millions doses (assuming distribution imperfect) strike unrealistic – doubly UK plans to, say, sell abroad.

Also, surprised vaccine produced applied phases.

* Phase 1: HCW high risk areas they're much risk. wait weeks, see start sprouting third arm bleeding ears.
* Phase 2: Extend larger population. Wait weeks.
* ...
* Phase 32 (or something): start inoculating pregnant women. many, case babies develop mutant powers.
* ...

etc.

Obviously, I'm expert this, given little data possible long term side-effects vaccine, would surprised government/NIH least thinking plan. People going restaurants infections waiting happen.

Wiped utensils plates. Staff taking masks. Patrons asymptomatic.

Go ahead. Enjoy meal lose sense smell taste.  No, Hazard name town.  people never sensitive first place. Deniers people know. Yeah. country garbage.

So what's plan? cat's bag, over. means deal cat. Like every Asian person planet earth?

You know mask supply went right?

While leaders telling us masks work, China Chinese people buying entire US supply. thank super genius pretty much plot Doom videogame franchise. turn monsters mow down. should, case vaccine pan out. billion grand scheme nothing.  haven’t paying attention news country you?   never poor time bet yourself. sleep better night knowing control destiny asshole boss. Trust me. hatred Facebook come lol. know guys facebook see much bs Reddit see Facebook That's pretty much irrelevant. $290 taxes. anti-masker Karens literally Farquaad meme.

Generally people question safety told already small chance, they're safe enough, greater good etc. overall made stressed scared trying make career it. degree path would low amount opportunities really want really needed job would likely take whatever can, might conflict personal ethics. whole attitude political climate around vaccines maybe much handle. 

I definitely want go back school something similar, maybe botany try work pharmaceutical sciences create medicine. judge. bunch Karen's Bubbas. feel like venting. feel sad angry whole situation. People disgust inconsiderate towards others. stayed closed, worn fucking mask, stayed apart situation. husband went gas station pick something person wearing mask. people even started snickering making fun him.

Seriously people- STOP BUYING MASKS! **They effective preventing general public catching** healthcare providers can’t get care sick patients, puts communities risk!

I’ve trying apply similar roles manufacturing actually really well result covid, without direct experience it’s hard get job especially many people looking; always someone else exact experience looking for.  live right next major midwestern city. 

I know stress job coupled constant rejection taking toll.  hear many people mention people won’t work they’re getting extra $600. want working! Rumor local hospital turned cardio ward COVID ward since COVID patients also cardio patients anyway point vet something like though? saw screenshots texts photos empty hospital beds oxygen tanks. One photo man face appears bandage stomach?

Not sure make this. I'm CO week almost everyone I've seen wearing one

CO implemented mandatory mask order last week everyone seeing week really wearing one. virus becomes widespread, that's going hit economy hard too. Might well gouge eyes now, hiding reality world keep waiving trump pom poms going keep getting harder harder True true. Excellent point. There’s fine line there. *Many* books written pandemic US fiasco. DeSantis them. descendants probably change last name avoid associated craven corrupt sociopath. honest question curious mind:

Why people likely sign these? risks?

I worked / traveled every single day 2020 (essential work). Stayed hotels - flew - interacted people - social distance masks. 

I consider good candidate tested. 

&amp;#x200B;

Why considered risky? Vaccine hack: use one metal bands facemask. Ok, boat become homeless starving. it’s someone super famous advocated masks huge effect anti maskers. Even they’ll probably believe “the dems” killed COVID. Dr. Fauci surgeon general. buck stops desk person responsible public policy, nobody else. tips mentioned, including say someone says infringing liberty requiring wear mask. experiences pay attention history trends. Consequences weigh effects. Perhaps recourse, know calling violence wise move eyes either separate Americas. bold assume know anything me.  missing 200-some odd countries territories mounted pandemic response. moved quickly aggressively suppressed spread point may able fully open again. acted like nothing wrong got blindsided. puzzling hear US overreacted, many states reacting weeks, even month behind rest world.

And we're looking countries respond outcomes, guidance feel personally. poor guidance system led people panic buy March handful deaths, shrug say ""Meh, I'm tired,"" we're 140,000 deaths. would care? would never able afford go anyways saying dont masks. many officials probably county health officials (who seem like complete idiots based two home/work area).

This sub saying wtf thinking everybody needs wear fucking mask. 

Somebody gave homemade mask early March definitely going around page reddit.

You correct lot officials ready say everybody wear mask back march, even shelter places started. Thats states werent really hit then. ignoring dont see hit coming need wear masks hand prevent it. government uselessness. bad actors government useful masters expense us. Although pretty good masks around here, still plenty people go open. I've seen article posted several times last two days, subtle push buy bitcoin judging name website. could HIV Diabetics retrain cells accept insulin Oh man, I'm sorry. sounds like got double whammy.

I Trump thing work elected work home. boss says already got ( missed day work) well family. Sounds like asymptotic, chances. That’s exactly I’m doing. don’t lot cases live, I’m still waiting results last week’s test. live family I’ve room since then, mask open door/go out. don’t symptoms, feel fine, working someone showing symptoms. Geez forgot Piggly Wiggly. Went one years years ago Texas confirm one redneck stores ever see. It’s likely, dealing virus lot work. didn’t feel like it. ignored it, thought would go away like happened lofe Yea one issue. Americans lazy. Show make buy. Americans do. biggest Consumer world. think said wear masks problems New York would (no ppe mask order).  snowflake truckers? Right? Like yes, good way get hospitalizations send someone else’s hospitals. die NW counts state’s data?

Good work, Arizona, manipulating numbers! Oh gotcha see now. says incivility assume call insurrection? Lol.

But yeah wish found accounts like trying fixed interactions would get rid permanently.

Are pretty much accounts participate freekarma4u subreddit sketchy accounts? Serious question: think cracks top 20 medical achievements? one think disgusting people willing suffer die make Trump look bad. verifying result first study smaller sample size smaller CI larger study... assuming everything new larger study. Phase III study introducing new variables making subjects new study geographically diverse. 1077 UK. I'm assuming added environmental influencing factors taking subjects different parts world different climates, living conditions, prevalent medical conditions region. I'm sure study make efforts keep age gender distribution somewhat scaled up, suddenly larger number diabetics? shown doesnt work causes side effects certain populations general? introduce challenge trials, effect results? 

There confidence interval. Yes, important, scale sample size increase complexity study. background environmental data science, I'm expert either, take. encourage read time. offered simplistic view this. body pretty cool system fighting infection science vaccines immune system something find pretty cool. Trump recommending something means nothing. Experts clear, covid cure.

Polio vaccine excellent example harmful vaccine. mentionned, despite many people hurt, still saves countless more.

If go back past offered take risk polio, still take it.  still long $AZN then? investors selling today wasn’t 110% good-to-go news? live like this.

How live? what's stopping participants going get antibody test month trial injection see antibodies?

won't help study (still need learn prevents infection, fights it), help person know they're control group not. mischaracterizing said position is. 

I take vaccine trusted country approves it, that's all. Trump administration bend science political gain, countries like that.  Wouldn’t kind make sense though? Shouldn’t state state scenario? think we'll start hear great things briefing /s understand concept rationing? Also, read sitting massive stockpile?  That's brave. know could that. I'm surprised Norway require type employment immigrate there. Plus virus eventually disappear  Cancel licenses. Make pay fines. Ruin fuckin lives. Somebody needs made example of. gonna lie, first half Pretty sure Brazil already part trials, remember something along lines local news. call BS. Europe making masks mandatory many countries, like Netherlands openly ridiculing people wearing masks. Spare BS. enforcing them? hear many countries fines heard many handed out. can't imagine everyone following country's mandate. 

Did French teens killed bus driver get fined wearing masks, addition murder charges? Ok kids serious problems grass/trees/pollen - kids get allergy injections help old enough simply walking building car enough eyes swell kick coughing/sneezing/snot mess. constantly got sinus infections snotty even allergy meds/nose sprays could (before injections could start). know lots kids without kind medical care could sit outside day. Smart companies healthy risk management departments mandating work home know potential liability mandate office work staff gets sick. see class action suits coming various industries soon, guarantee countless lawyers working cases speak. Seeing happened day cares camps helped husband solidify decision school online year. I'm incredibly grateful district came great, robust online program. wish could everywhere.  Maybe donation countries need aid too. doubt whole population would need vaccine. may let people less vulnerable exposed it. may also need future too. Speak yourself. sleep floor every night choice. Also covid almost 3 months ago along 78 year old grandfather cancer smoked 60 years. fine. Ive worse colds. Chances even know. Induced mass hysteria observing. deadly virus. prisoner fear. Go live life fucks sake. seems like giant RPG me, republicans lawful evil(easy set across firm message culturally homogynous group), democrats lawful neutral(people tend vote Establishment Democrats hold status quo making things actively worse; actually might traditionally conservative sector US political realm) progressive wing chaotic good (ex: BLM protests hard time setting firm line stances because, definition, encompass heterogynous subsection society). want them. mobile, linked site readable: trump's administration's oversight. That's oversight running trials, even Moderna tried buck it. 

I believe Trump wants vaccine election, force approval process approve something whether ok not. import patients regular times. 

I wonder state patients show stats though? mess. wonder vaccines cure common cold.  Doubtful tgeyre genetically specific. if.. How's politics? meme 

By ever logic going every comment mentioning America thread removed, get work Florida - really real? know, I'm wearing mask I'm out. everyone else yelling freedoms think already know answers questions. many places world don’t vaccinations lots illnesses.

I hepatitis A+B vaccine Canada, people Africa, parts Asia Central America?   **everywhere**. 

not texas. May made comment football wasnt happening year everyone needed relax. downvoted hell.


Last laugh best laugh. Pretty sure picked wrong comment piggyback dude. valid points, wrong place make stand financial literacy. 

They live hedonic treadmill, die hedonic treadmill. don’t entertain though. Ants crawling patients. Dead bodies left days. 

What. The. Fuck. amount weapons reasons guys still bad could been. Nothing say wrong, appears getting downvoted realistic. 
Funding bodies struggling, CRUK lost huge amounts donations? 
I consider lucky received two year extension contract April I'm pretty worried happens that.

Edit add: Oxford staff already warned cost living increase two year hiring freeze (with exception research positions fully funded external funding). Agreed. However also shows perspective, one state total cases recorded COUNTRIES. DeSantis deserves shamed. allowed burn state obscurity. in-game microtransactions going rack up. live central ny, friend hairstylist business opened three weeks ago . huge rush people first weeks, things slowing way down. Cases low people still nervous reluctant go anywhere. worse gets slower business get paying keep business open that's getting many customers use worse long run simply shut down.  Similar states are? Crazy don’t need it..  going cover money that's putting lot effort developing vaccine. know that, [here number recruiting vaccine Note locations far right. couple US-based. Lockdown side phenomenon. usually times crisis wars people start breed. must inherent trigger nature switches on, probably countermeasure ancient past avoid total anihlation species. That's actually argument direct species jump bats, bats live outdoors, argument favor lab origin, labs indoor environments.

I've seen leaps logic, morpheus matrix scene type jumps. Nobody does. bottle neck waiting volunteers get sick. enough do, see got real vaccine placebo. way common see placebo patients virus given vaccine, proven effective released governments distribution fairly immediately. bullshit let test subject ? Write letter NBA. USA USA USA! muh russia gate. really post whole paragraph say muh russia gate? UK vaccine wait turn yank weirdo sorry I'm confused whats that? sounds cool Geauga bud. think want get hands dirty talking cultural appropriateness course get messy. end day though something like want people going door door look like reflect communities they're working in. simple enough.

Far often programs consider comes worst kind paternalism. Truckers sense. big! really boost Trumps re-election chances!  too, buddy. robbed favorite time year - hoping best 🙏 would get it? medications approved been, recently Trump administration hydroxyclorquine. dangerous vaccines int past, like polio vaccine taht hurt people. 

They cutting corners. 

I'll take vaccine governments countries trust approve it, trump administration does. no, protests rioting. mean White House gets burned kind riots.  *if* job offer degree match-up specified professions. ethically intentional exposure check protection table.

It's not, human challenge trials run. ""are going to""? Well true there's plenty stories last month people dying getting sick specifically posted hoax masks stupid attending parties/bars/et etc etc Remember. American dream selfish dream get lucky. care minimally others it’s showing rn. Believe me, holier one. 

But set wage. control do.  *do* control expenses.  want mercy ""them"" give take $600/month whim, go right ahead.  prefer control economic future. Back net! don’t understand attacks southern town southern town still don’t want anything it, like getting sick? I’m confused. Let fix headline: ""U.S. EMPLOYEES fear workplace coronavirus precautions address airborne risk.""

I see many US companies much concerned taking precautions, nevermind airborne risk. city health issues, namely pandemic, wear masks. live Norway, last year got new colleague California. quit job, selected city Europe moved. Started apply jobs learning language. Hey employees, get class action suit ready dude related electronics company really hope developed outside United States. another country finds usable vaccine least little faith they'll open good world. find first I'm afraid administration claim falls ""homeland security"" provisions bungle domestic deployment try bullshit rest world it. Originally experts thought people would develop immunity vector destroy quickly upon second exposure, originally expected Oxford vaccine cannot work booster. turned better expected, u/raddaya explained days ago: ""However, appears case, least animals, booster doses Chadox fact end significant immune response adenovirus itself.""  triggers reopen people control data interesting. well good single infectious person walks through. Smh.  wonder workplace asshole verifying? live Michigan got money easily quickly boss supportive process. Though thanks PPP work full time months got shifted 8 hrs week 40 time $600 end =/. That's gonna absolute shitshow. going teams locks playoff spot even superbowl losing way games multiple star players taking 3 weeks off. guess different good player injured half season, whole entire position groups different times season??

I still watch, could really affect quality might lose fans don’t need it.. I’m antivax either (I got shots get future kids shots) Uh incorrect statement. 70% population America supports widespread mask mandates bc government hijacked past 4 years mean majority population selfish. live nyc 90% population wears masks. simply making unfair generalizations entire population based see media. Maybe ignorant. problem? Obviously look problem loudest places support conservative ideals actually lot places America situation less control. Day late dollar short, always pull wipers up, put junky towel *would* snap slipped. way impact absorbed. would get one something even phase me?

The disease kills people. vaccine doesn't.

So probably better train immune system getting vaccine rather getting disease. want turtle nice LONG life natural habitat??? cruel keep prisoner 30 years. lokked first stage, website. though, live certain areas underlying conditions. tracking study I'm part asked would added register people willing it. Prove voted glorious leader Trump get exclusive covid vaccine exclusive dlc playstation EA Activision. new lies announce? new bullshit try distract with?

How many Americans must die total failure leadership? say like it’s bad thing surprised many scientists doctors struggle similar tasks. we're people different skillets Knew gave much room manoeuvrer around stuff can't answer, keep simple time even though got say. pain ass argue dishonest people. 

You actually free make many points u like, idc. put words mouth claiming things never said stick original argument made since u replied first place. Otherwise waste time None Denmark, Norway Finland use masks. constantly held countries handled well managed keep really low infection rate since beginning. lack masks affecting all. 

Except reduced community transmission towards zero opted totally different strategy herd immunity Sweden. jury still though even countries borders re-opening we're heading fall again, u stuck thread objectively rather disingenuous smearing, u noticed gave u multiple examples countries shared similar experience yet suffered inevitably, another round infections.

Its u really, u want keep civil thread objectively, u go course again, bother u anymore.

This right problem. can't spend half rent cost healthcare I'm fucked can't afford all.

Walmart offers better employee health plans ACA. Think that. $60/month gets started premium plans.

And yeah, ACA good things least, fails meet goal. That's said gutted rather repealed. unnamed Washington team well. honestly feel guy goes logs work find Reddit time vastly greater “work time” - ever missed deadline deliverable - nope tell could SARS vaccine virus dying out?

You can't. That's funding dried development stopped fearmongering, please bad looks, it’s actually worse. Many industries propped artificially.

Airlines, instance, travel-adjacent industries utterly decimated. airlines NINETY PERCENT. months. 

Some airlines got huge bailout contingent using money keeping employees paid. dries Sept/Oct that’s another huge bump unemployment.

I sure industries dog-paddling place drift towards waterfall. Okay, thanks advice! stupid. Please don’t shit parade! 😩 worry, white power! see.

Remember comment paramedic. One presentations we've seen since March[I Mass.] GI symptoms without shortness breath. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, pale color. shortness breath, maybe sats low, lot people coming back positives. think dropping slightly 70k means we're ""winning"". Still trying define winning means past years. pay total 41% tax + 13% healthcare.
I pay total 36% total tax + healthcare France, 74k USD salary.

""America, fuck yeah, land great lying people!"" that's raw deal got friend! 

I'm sorry hear healthcare running :( Please keep safe! think might issue minimum wage low government decided $600 week needed survive?

And unemployment payments good give go back work - maybe sort graduated system person still earn money halving give security steady payment every week? see minimum income system working well people rely unsteady part time minimum wage work. would go back could reliable known payment coming every week? wild think short-term horror may result long-term eradication viral illnesses. keep saying free, ""free**"". tons people several hundred dollar testing bills, thousands. like necessarily known prior either. like menu prices (as dystopian would be, somehow would actually better current situation) walk doctor's office.

Good Lord There's Oxford Mississippi! yeah really starting circlejerk point Please clarify.

Genuinely curious...I agree citizens country receive first!! That's phase 3 trials for, [already mentioned September Oh, Oxford, Mississippi? USA! USA! worked animals. Disease died funding stopped.

He's going learn quickly makes difference teams problems pre lockdown. agree. I'm giving reason. can't wait trump talk this. ""Our numbers good, we're saving world numbers"" think cut corners since long developed vaccine. However worried dangerous side-effects taking vaccine, however, 70% people trial developed either fever headache.

We large anti-science population they're going latch sorts craziness. signed up! recently found situation wearing mask driving alone vehicle. transporting someone recently arrived United States. drove windows open two passengers rode back. wore masks. exited vehicle, wiped interior clorox wipes, left windows open AC blowing, drove home mask departure. would hope nothing residual swirling air left know? drove alone mask safe side...fully aware clueless must looked outside. Doesn’t matter, duty protect family screw haters.

Just bringing point might logical reason small amount folks wearing mask driving alone. also point reason many hopeful summer would kill virus Vitamin direct effect immune system? So, since people generally get less Vitamin winter, we're also going contend people getting COVID-19 something like flu pneumonia. Thank family they’re doing! really better national response now. live Boston university work rolling plans reopening. It’s frustrating see. I’m leaving job go back school (online) concerned safety practices workers/students,the thing frustrates/scares schools reopening in-person classes, thousands students going flood city high-transmission states haven’t expected practice social distancing wear masks. 

Even schools require masks, etc attending classes, many students going social distance free time? raised concern employer I’m low level staff, doesn’t change every university town going operate. We’re talking hundreds thousands students normal times.

Driving Cambridge last week saw highest amount maskless people public I’ve seen months, majority appeared undergrad age. even saw 4 people trying board bus masks even though can’t ride without mask right now. 

When cases spike it’s going people like mom 50s works healthcare job/regularly sees covid patients put risk. see whole situation giant middle finger universities community meanwhile city/state government isn’t acting universities big employers donate campaigns. 

tl;dr Boston fucked We’ve already bought shitload corpse home told police can't come house ""light em up"" police kindly put it. likely available UK first, imagine reason Boris destroyed politically vaccine goes people Brits stop dying. given scale production UK need 70 million vials. hope given front line workers world wide end Autumn vaccine Hepatitis also well known vaccine requires boosters 6-10 years. daughter immunocompromised honest people usually apologetic starting shit heads. 

Sometimes tell kids dont catch it. Fuck people. Assuming test results accurate, chances getting infected family member virus vary 10% 60%, see ""Household Secondary Attack Rate"" research data. counter-intuitive lot people (including me) article really helped understand unevenness spread: **""Why COVID-19 patients infect many others, whereas don’t spread virus all?""** "" Without social distancing, reproduction number (R) three. real life, people infect many others others don’t spread disease all. fact, latter norm, Lloyd-Smith says: “The consistent pattern common number zero. people transmit.” "" Holy shit. :( think misunderstood something would certainly better case. right now, think focus getting everyone wear mask, even right. Because, sadly, we're still place we're fighting broadly normalize mask wearing. happens, turn focus towards ensuring effective use masks. 

But, stands, please, everyone, wear mask.  We'll flog em USA profit half right; article mentions surgical masks, designed primarily protect others - also mentions n95 etc. respirators, designed primarily protect wearer.

Surgical masks certainly offer degree protection (to others - though probably also bit wearer), much improved much reduced depending well fit person. Unfiltered exhalations shooting around nose reason people get glasses fogging issue.

Interestingly, masks used since 17th century, medieval period them. understand workplaces required notify person person worked talked to, persons ""close contact"" considered closer 6 feet 15 minutes. least workplace handling contact tracing. thatI agree it, believe minimum required standard employers. England never forgotten about, that's fucking point. anything labelled UK entire planet thinks England, that's honest truth. three countries get zero recognition UK getting mention correlated England international stage. Get fuck bullshit.

Want know much England gets credit everything UK achieves? People still ask me, clear Scotsman, US different US England. *ENGLAND*. know I'm Scottish, even asked, still call UK England face England UK thing England international stage taking limelight away UK countries long one even realizes exist part group anymore.

You strike someone needs attention offended singled attention every small opportunity. Yeah, that's thinking meant sure special holidays October.


I live Florida I'm honestly super nervous coming months. lifted restrictions, protests + anti-maskers. people seemingly also becoming disillusioned grow frustrated isolating, media outlets (along dumpster fire cheif) inacurately downplayed virus recent months. 

our country failing whole though. nations last place. may wave back forth region region time being, tide strong matter careful point. 

even strong, definitive voice government proper safety moving foward, late, land return. mention, trump values self-serving propoganda far lives american citizens, proper pandemic response merely fantasy. 

lives still saved, we'll see many deaths even october (which likely dealiest month).gop political heads really need roll subsides. fucking pathetic Americans don’t even seem care. Sad sad times Ants crawling one patient who, paramedic, probably covered ants home transported hospital condition.

That person abhorrently obese. common ants, Flys, maggots, fleas, etc butt cracks, fat folds, clothes people. feel you. finally landed job 3 months searching. Indeed shows many people applying job 500+ every job one scarier things I've seen.

It's really sad people charge country willing gamble working people's lives. Yeah. Pretty much every company wants put approved message make sure someone's individual views get reported views company whole.

That said, whistleblowing horrible conditions really media policies aimed at. reminder text sent CYA scare tactic get share what's actually going damaging reputation possibly breaking law. would really surprised saw happens sometimes hospitals.

Healthcare pro death's antroom

FTFY absolutely data back notion spread higher among younger people peak. difference us seeing spread among groups testing. 

If young people fact harbouring infections previous months, rate hospitalizatios among people low 60s would increase. all, share workplaces, public transportations, supermarkets. thats happening. 

Region Stockholm positivity rate 13,5% week 25 lower testing. Week 29 3,3%. last friday 11:30 monday 11:30 reported 293 cases. Thats 73 cases per day. 2,4 million people.

Are saying young people super prone test week 25 week 29? means RT’s change oxygen take every 90 seconds people refuse wear masks 1A right leaning individuals. 
How understand that? never wish illness death anyone stupid arrogant enough gamble, maybe deserve comes forth. needs video alll see KNOW happening. fake news. liberal agenda get rid Trump. /s “I’ll right eventually”

- Literally Donald Trump That's OMS saying anyway. sick people risk. honestly trust vaccine developed Oxford one developed Harvard solely based potential trump administration trying fuck every country over. don’t worry— die absurdly high medical bills haunt loved ones. 

Unfuckingreal called ""heroes""

I thought enough field you. managed land job, boss total psychopath. least another remote job side, I’m trapped barely anyone else hiring. I.e. mondays always “low” day due reporting lag. Sundays too. example, last week, California reported 7200 cases last Sunday 8350 last Monday, jump 9500 Tuesday - Saturday.

Yesterday reported 8100. 12.5% increase last Sunday. Land Free even regulate first place ? this, outside, said post  Honestly, move Canada near term escape pandemic (if even possible), USA's handling made seriously question long-term interest staying here. feels like getting dumber dumber. I've always dreamed living Vancouver area maybe final straw... I'm still waiting response, co-workers nervous. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message*   heckin movies.

He'll criticized time took turnaround mask nonsense.

A weeks ago said ""all masks"" ""thinks masks good.""

Today United effort defeat Invisible China Virus, many people say Patriotic wear face mask can’t socially distance. nobody Patriotic me, favorite President!

Let know either statements result people calling fascist Yeah owners cash leave company gutted lawsuit swim money gained years cutting corners. Maybe wait blow work board another medical providers network- fine.

Sally nurse unemployed probably stigmatized working shithole. articles always seem gloss fact can’t show border say you’re moving here.

It’s country accept whoever wants in.  Imagine bad it’d wasn’t hoax

Minus ants stuff, scenarios similar ones describing happening NYC 3 months thought people would taken warning Travel entertainment spending Close entertainment 

Entirely nonessential Trump Governors refusing lock / accept inaction leading thousands deaths tried crimes humanity said done. apologize I've confused too, no, I'm suggesting, tons proof it, fair bit improper reporting going on, happened Italy Spain too, peaks.

EMS Italy Spain simply picking dead people homes tested, necessarily record Corona Virus deaths, damn sure ambulance crews utterly disinfected wagon every one them.

There came point Italy bring freezer trucks store bodies, eventually bring military take bodies away. AZ TX ""freezer truck"" stage.

How many ICU rooms think left? We've already seen reports people dying turned away going watch dog pony ""Be Happy"" show. never said Texas. Reading comprehension ftw. I’m paid algebra. work publishing. Violent offenses, including murder, non-negligent manslaughter robbery, property crimes like burglary, larceny vehicle thefts dropped except rape (that went up). watching numbers disbelief governments think really going on... Say something intelligent Political responses across country remembered idiots try rise politics may take posts!. Remember failures lack leadership Hopefully will. Atleast we'd able normal summer next year. I'm trying optimistic. late.

We’re hella worse many, depending metric 😣 verified working money passes hands? miss that.

You Covid. recover. year later let's say kidney problems. insurance company says ""oh, pre-existing condition!"" denies coverage.

This difficult understand. Also professional wrestlers said young people get influenced, influencer discussion. proud worse older ignorant,excuse me, loudly ignorant. 

You're definitely target anger regarding said spreading misinformation. that's pretty healthy thing upset about. regression nation misinformation social media causing huge divide room discussion ideas. worse example pretty much denying fact. 

And thanks know knowledge limited california also know California state allow treatment illness cough different illness included cough symptom. 

You wrong, snarky it. ne embarrassed, thank god anonymous right? Take care miss salt n pepa don’t know neck woods, TX teacher unions strikes illegal. teacher strikes teaching license permanently revoked forfeit pension accrual. 
It’s fucked. Sorry man, lost dad last march cancer bad I'm glad happen year. 


Also though, knew would could. whole things mess. I'm sorry. europe work pub Berlin we’ve open since late May. change corona numbers though. “Opening up” means 90% things normal everyone still taking precautions. incident Disneyland California last year) Pro-science definitely involves tracking potentially significant case reports even implications unsettling. Like way Sweden exposed population virus herd immunity theory? Thanks this: found helpful interesting 👍 many people prepared another shutdown financially wonder Let ~~eat cake~~ sniffles. Remember POTUS said going go Mars can’t even go Europe 😂😭 believe vaccine made quickly safe test use humans without feasible long term effects? Yikes Goodluck w ur 8 month vaccine u become infertile remember ur ignorance. Nice tits. Bizarre? Try absurd!  flu still exists. (french) top 1 antivaxx country, I'm sure Username checks fact small percentage global population matter terms disease behaves?

Because loss immunity would roughly follow normal distribution, plausible median/std-dev distribution would result small percentage (2-3% lower) confirmed cases March so, multiplied general likelihood infection time period since early cases became susceptible re-infection, run math get quite small number re-infections would seeing point.

This mean re-infection true, mean can't rule statistically yet, able time. problem hospitals full fools loved ones need them. And, btw fools destroying economy national security. need shut consequences, legal consequences like drunk drivers must face. Fines jail time. back 08/09, China go recession expected now.  agree hair thing, attached, top top, bottom bottom going around back head, pull mask tighter broader angles sides around ear smaller pull points can’t get good seal....

They annoying me, I’d prefer behind head ones... Literal billionaires whole russian elite already took shots vaccine. Anyone stll discredits efforts Russia idiot. always find funny someone says ""Evaluate evidence yourself"" dope comments ""NO ONE CARES PERSON THINKS"" Yea that's one way deal it. hand, civilized country, path without lot needless human death suffering Right? people know aren’t anti-vaxxers whatsoever scared injected something hasn’t tested rigorously. It’s hard fault anyone mindset.

Think many people refusing wear mask. NONE people vaccinated. think people *are* wearing mask rightfully scared something implemented without normal standards research “hold out” see happens.

This going mean false sense security less distancing/hand washing etc disastrous results.

(In America. I’m sure countries’ populations actually correctly) right mind would go cruise moment? article isn’t talking different strains different reactions. inb4 they're talking 6 different types clinical manifestations, 6 types virus omg hilarious. love Paul Rudd think classifying set symptoms get infection, strain virus. 2017, Uyghurs allowed children Han Chinese. they're treated equally, good. suddenly altered family planning policy ethnic minorities children Hans. 
In 2017, policy revised permit urban couples two children rural couples three children regardless ethnicity. Yes, sure. Thus F option. also recognize much difficult reach depth knowledge they're side screen. one know what's going world around them, ability maintain focus must taken account. Heck, kids around ended take care siblings sitting Zoom classes. would imagine teachers might wish relax standards based obvious roadblocks learning. 150k people serious organ failure lost limb??? Omfg! Please tell isn’t true!?!?! Ya probably right. think remembered backwards. They're gonna overtake Brazil tbh NSFW, dude. Grew Placerville. confirm ""Apple Bistro"" shithole failed business replaced went years back. Every time go home, I'm shocked they're still business. Jesus Christ.. insane.. really wish end soon possible.  Wooooow. went loud. 

So you’re fully conversant CA insurance regulations. That’s important job, obviously. 

Are fully conversant regulations 50 states regard pre-existing condition exclusion periods/exclusionary riders, state handles secondary conditions circumstances? vary widely, follow CA’s standard. 

As rest comment, well, uh... okay then. There’s lot going there. Seems like you’ve got lot anger current circumstances, I’m convinced I’m best target them. 

Also, salt-and-pepper hair thanks calling young. Hopefully revert previous color now.

ETA - respond stated concern, never claimed cough would forever exclude pneumonia treatment. cough never qualified pre-existing condition, whereas two illnesses listed did, SARS-CoV-2 certainly would. 

Given broad range conditions secondary it, SARS-CoV-2 exclusion state secondary conditions could also excluded (and insurers states WOULD push this) would mean great many things could potentially excluded, leaving patients try navigate complex appeals process trying manage health. That’s unnerving scenario. *haha* ~~I'm danger~~ We're fucked.  r/pornavirus didn’t say never happens. know that, what’s point this? I'm guessing mean either rigged election, something even worse coming winner. didn’t, show evidence    Hahahahahaha exactly! Im stupid enough think talk long term damage disease hasn’t even year yet. 

Just like medical experts keep saying.

So makes qualified them? Where’s time machine at, bro? 

Just feel even dumber:

Lungs heal. Lungs even heal smoking. respiratory system great smooth brained genius like go around talk damage, data, it’s going long term?

Maybe damage isn’t permanent? Maybe it’s gone year? Maybe we‘ll find much worse issues later line? 

Who knows. certainly don’t. Neither professionals, don’t stop assuming start using brain? ...uh... masks? ever heard Yep. Apparently they’re Facebook group something degree. I’m Indiana it’s first time I’ve heard them. ( hopefully last) releasing Phase trial data. Phase II/III trials ongoing. See Holy shit guy called it. Another thing tech already exists use app dictates speech text hearing imparted student struggling. recently saw ambulance driver using google transcribe app looked perfect. hope using guinea pigs. Q: Know Americans leading covid cases? 

A: Dumb fucks like who'd rather meme poor afford quality goods rather intelligence.

Why bother actual discussion circlejerk way 3million covid cases? Karma karma, memeing much chickens come home roost. “Safe” It’s building factory. raw materials Needed create masks hard come by. approvals health Canada easy come either.

I sell NIOSH masks Korea let tell it’s people think all. Shipping stuff seas plane super expensive manufacturers upped prices significantly overseas. 

Long story short it’s MUCH complicated people think is. r/rareinsults like that, another mystery box concieved. taken nephew two weeks everytime gets tested Orlando. tested positive allowed back work tested negative twice. kind B******T happening America. Saddened fact country served for. Shameful. future holds grandchildren? I'll keep praying hoping. God Bless All. Well that's hyperbolic stance take single comment. Insufferable?  Basically **cold states**...

You spelled ""midwestern U.S."" wrong; northeast trying damnedest get rid thing.  US ahead Sweden comes cases per 1m. that's scary considering Sweden close all?  well overweight basically preexisting condition, even ""totally healthy"" otherwise. die traffic accident, chances cause death actually traffic accident blunt forced trauma blood loss. However view it, cannot deny death traffic accident. counting actual cause death named different one drivers drunk gross negligence. beautify every statistic, doesn´t make true. think also wish know go on.  Golly really think hungry homeless worth living through...that suffering living grateful suffer? WTF? think one main issues countries like US UK we're beyond preventive measures applying band-aids everywhere. 

Costs increasing due high number obese people end-up many issues necessarily arise healthy weight category. 

We able provide healthcare everyone, achieve this, people also obliged remain healthy, otherwise pay premium. smoke, cost lung cancer treatment you. obese, pay diabetes treatment, etc. 

I know bit controversial approach, I've realised anything, people responsible actions anymore, really upsetting honest.

Back topic US system, think right, definitely achieve something US looking Spain, even France do, they'll actually need leader willing take country's health consideration, turn-down medical lobbies gifts cash :/ reason concern dramatically short-term loss immunity affects necessary social health mitigations turns true. vital examine cases thoroughly. simply mathematically case ruled _at point_ small number -- demonstrate simple math: example assume hypothetical loss immunity follows roughly normal distribution median time occurs 6 months 1 month standard deviation, allow reporting lag, use current overall probability infection US (which higher almost everywhere else) see expect handful cases far (&lt;100, possibly &lt; 50).

(note: I'm suggesting hypothetical immunity scenario real, using demostrate scenarios _like that_ would point producing small numbers re-infections. idea immunity _can't_ short-lived large number cases we've seems naiively ""true"" statistically wrong) pick common element virus use vaccine, although assume strains make development vaccine harder hey, russian bot? R0 average spread per person. However, studies shown distribution highly uneven.

Instead say, 2,3,4,2,2,3,2,4,1,3,2... like, 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0. Hence term 'super-spreader'. virus spread much people responsible, right conditions, one responsible person infect 100

 think missed paragraph comment referring to. Covid, mess heart, lungs, brain, kidneys, really anything... survive Covid deny treatment damn near anything fear, live decades. may magic disappear. 90% comments finding reason upset good news usual point, they've got getting close reaching core earth. already know certain people contracted twice? keep seeing posts sub repeating already know, news? Ah, ok, think see mean now. long take contact signed up? signed days website went live heard anything. work bar hotspot. low positivity rates population large still case places US. Take Washington State cases definitely rise -- confirmed cases around 1,000/day, say actual cases like 3,000/day tested absolutely everyone. would 21,000 cases week. population WA 7.54 million, looking 0.3% positive across entire population. that's average across entire state--it's prevalent areas areas, naturally get better sense devote PCR testing resources, really efficient testing areas lower rates infection. 

Imagine employers faced decision either lock batch test employees. 0.3% positive across state, businesses would positive cases could keep operating normal batch test comes back negative.

Think providing government aid small businesses--instead blanket lockdown, determine businesses essential non-essential--you could strategically close provide aid businesses positive cases, allow employees chance quarantine, generally keeping businesses operational. warning could happen, like example places like China, Italy, Iran, even NYC. Republicans tough.

For people saying ""just get job"" I'm trying I'm like lot people. job market specialized days, specific skill set limits could actually get job generic. Keep mind near minimum wage became unemployed taking one jobs create effect staying whatever I'm getting unemployment ie bills paid.

I think anyone figured many focusing bank account. going get worse worse people act ways make black lives matter protests look like distraction. believe Google ""revolution"" (any do) see people before, after. here. dont know sub maybe covid19positive covid19.....and one Everyone knew McAllen told get away fast enough, would assume that's kind city neglected underfunded handle type thing. also know people say see pictures people dying can't true. hope see this. New Zealand already struggling brain gain package skilled labor.

They suspend due COVID-19.

I can't imagine, post COVID-19, they'd h less skilled labor program  ways see Canadians mishandling things?

Masks mandatory ago. proof negative impacts, proof positive impacts popping countries implemented them, Even US people took upon wear them. would vastly prefer people get serious pandemic wear without obligation, seeing people fightning it, think wise give choice.

The first response pandemic took ramp properly. People Quebec already cancelling spring break plans government still ""slowly preparing"". can't talk provinces, seeing provinces issues ramping testing, probably facing preparation challenges.

We also closed cities lot faster. Again, mostly based experience Montreal... city locked lot quicker. And, lock still effect. fight pandemic letting asymptomatic people roam free, since can't test everyone plan travel, there's real way control this.

Closing regions would also help open businesses. region covid-free, new infections harder time get spread.

Retirement homes really peak pandemic though. since Quebec decided send people hospitals retirement homes free space, packed retirement homes created situation virus spread quickly.

Things far better outside Quebec though. cases seems ramping again, meaning stopped paying attention. Considering we're summer vacation construction worker here... expect good case spike Quebec couple weeks.

Also : people already spreading misinformation mandatory vaccination campaign, saying thegovernment added laws April... oldest reference could find law 2001 article already there...

That pandemic mess really. matter. next generation never understand irony teacher ICU instead covering topic. First release Chinese needle snakes, gorillas, gorillas simply freeze death.  Yeah, that's probably mainly anti-maskers - see many masks days Atlantic Canada, probably 11 active cases spread across 4 provinces. People feel safe.

I agree it, see general feeling kind control lead fewer people wearing masks. hear thing friends provinces think high degree confidence government handling things well actually detriment there.

It's kind thing makes support mandatory mask policies, actually. People make weird decisions stress, better give clear guidance national level. course, think employers would give health officials would push more. Considering situation, work home seems like one easiest ways reduce transmission without damaging economy. Sure one lives Toronto right? seasons like fall, spring summer well. Hmmm checked paperwork said I’m “rat shit pill” group. control group? I’d also love sign trials also. U.S. well. Preferably Cali state close by. Ron DeSantis let happen Florida LA ridiculous Thanks god UK worry Feds monopolized charge everyone high mark price. president anti vax tell Stock symbol? Yep. Time keeps getting squandered White House wants create illusion normalcy. several months lead time get testing protocols place back January, February March, wasted it. done, we'd much better position now. What's point. Every day marvel shitty tech infrastructure non-tech fields I’ve feels. field work in? marketing design/graphic design live capital city. It’s rough there. revisionist history means specific US.

The *World* Health Organization giving advice, many national health departments giving guidance CDC WHO.

Mask usage little US shitfest. Mask compliance US high higher many Western countries much better us right now. New headline weeks “ Experimental Vaccine causes people fall Windows”  2025 January, Washington Post reliably anti-whatever President doing. Looks like Europe &amp; usa gamble buy knowing work going pay off. thought control? Holy shit that’s terrible. posts need blasted news outlets people learn. never happen tho. Maybe wear mask it, otherwise 0% effective. Psychologists studying phenomena decades... They're ton. cut funding testing, threatened schools refusing reopen, downplayed pandemic, dismissed masks, attacked public health experts.

Doing reverse would:

* Increase funding testing 
* Support schools refused reopen / threatened schools tried reopen 
* Encourage mask use 
* Praise listen public health experts I’m sorry, sucks COVID deaths:

US: **146,000** Entire continent Asia: **35,000**

Masks?

US: **NO** Entire continent Asia: **YES**

Would like u/AMeowingCat's great insight this. 71 days ago one comment, shame Yeah you’re going find retest people anyways. Batch testing good percent positive much lower. Amen child ever learned thing standardized, public education created. Serum Institute (India) making millions doses month already distributed profit basis. 

The problem distribution issue Africa South America too. close friend mine valley. uncle tested positive covid showing symptoms. week later showed hospital symptoms worsened pain worried. Staff told simply room sent home.

This two weeks ago. bad y'all think now? Someone guinea pig order get successful vaccine. Isolate get tested ASAP. true. also think would he’s decent human. think biden lot problems candidate one thing certainly heart. broke too? to? case good luck ❤️  Multiple countries vaccine candidates trialed, one, really see saying this. Honestly thinking lot lately. boyfriend Canadian still Canadian citizen. Yeah, like nice patriotism worship NHS monarchs remember we’re shit together definition american looks like r/wallstreetbets getting 500,000 new members. Fucking hell. Seriously might get vaccine year. avoidable. Poor sent die walled estates. [America surgery ""colorado doctors plan"" majority pre surgery diagnostics less co pay (yes..less..so copay would $600 lucky paid $580 doctors office doesnt even charge much). hit pocket max ($7,500) surgery alone...a coworker uses husbands insurance similar complex surgery time paid $100 pocket. Ouch. also Unfortunately still dealing getting pay doctors almost year. didnt single claim didnt argue would fix claim cover it. Oh also pay doctor pocket. Gym finally opened, hit hard weeks, least mine pretty spaced (I also work like 10 pm, like 3 people total). Still feels weird, feels weirder getting energy stress otherwise. finished acrylic painting backlog (had 30+ canvases), still work full hours 40% capacity (patients clinic). mental health suffers greatly, still though, since feel pretty purposeless, even physician. Personally purposeless, work purpose robot full work mode.

I've never felt despairingly alone, tension insane. sleep well never slept well worse ever. recovery options self-soothe limited. Diffusing essential oils grinding teeth night practicing fricken' mindfulness meditation...!

I feel adrift, hanging onto cobbled together plankraft things working aren't. also kind sucks single gay guy whole mess, too, I've put dating things hold. gym kind last resort 'feel relevant' lose progress order stay 'in game' whenever returns, if, blarrgh. Hard get educated hospital bed ventilated. teacher dies can't get another teacher let alone sub class.

Education done alternate ways. Yet many countries blindly followed. mandated March initial transmission period. reminder, number new cases per day isn’t effective way indicating good bad sars-cov2 is. percent positive rate gives much better picture, average US flat recently over??? REALLY? lol lol unbelievable! RaTG13, precursor current virus, infected six miners. authors' theory unusual situation related coronaviruses got deep lungs (not normal location coronavirus infection) evolved something deadly enough kill three them. answers question evolved well suit humans evolved speak since then, way zoonotic theory alone not. What? No...all mRNA vaccines make cells produce antigen rather needing foreign source, would still need get vaccine different strain appears Placebo effect still work even know placebo.  really hope research shared world free big FU big pharma - particularly american companies.

With bit luck may regain us respect European peers following big B mean people ignoring rules like asking Oh yes, indications published. n=4 isn’t really possible draw conclusions. would say nothing indicate drop 43 days, course nothing indicate effect either. Basically study exhausted useful data producing activity. Right?? gonna best year movie history female-led female-directed blockbusters, wanted see badly, COURSE pandemic hit *just* now. I’m fucking mad it! 

(Inb4 wise-asses; Yes also fucking things going shit world, one them. I’m capable complex thought thx) Yes I'm aware Phase 3 final results fail see I'm wrong. Ah, clarified pandemic control. Obviously nobody visiting states right now, period.

Also I'm incredibly jealous closest park pictured rocks. Oklahoma's governor thing nailed it. Take L jokes aside, yes, likely working home unless get COVID ""if multiple people (my) building test positive, executives decide do"".  perfectly written. want be. one possibility also discuss passaging likely occurred experimentation animals. fact explain amount change original virus samples would almost impossible without additional experimentation. idea sort timeline scenarios might looking here?

Looking Moderna mRNA-1273 Vaccine Phase III trial, study expected complete October 2022 guessing trial showing exceptional results, would go faster, also recognize showing something significantly causes absence something safely take while.

Is Moderna trial representative sort timeline could expect Oxford vaccine? process faster UK? lot us Florida vote DeSantis basically quarantined since early March sign safe resume going soon percentage state gone full conspiracy FloridaMan. bothers people write state us irresponsible jackasses. Sometimes best emotionally strong family. take much effort job current circumstances. remember, many networks would actually carry small portion COVID pressers Trump using campaigning platform lieu in-person rallies. I’m sure we’ll right back nonsense. always chucked network would break away anchor would make comment basically equates to, “Ohhhkay, enough that...” lolol Conveniently omitting US invested $1.2B UK $23M. Also forgetting Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax, Regeneron, J&amp;J, Merck, Inovio. 

Keep uneducated Reddit talking points. Getting hair cut..... I’m big fan comma, equally high expectations vaccine Let's see, many people anti mask also anti vax? truth is, hey gonna hurt hear, truth many people refuse Covid vaccine point idea vaccine driven herd immunity pipe dream. best hope vaccine protects people get long follow reasonable health safety guidelines like wearing mask. Well, atleast know need chip 

narrator: anyway Someone hasn’t popping blue cure bubbles think it’s control life one thing control enjoy power gives them. think “I make everyone mad wearing mask, badass I!”  bro 2,000 times dose human gets, multiple times, dose injected nose mouth freaking eyes.

Let know fall stack syringes full corona. *have* video recordings pictures ICU. People say it’s greenscreen fake anyway. guess deaths numbers really get see faces lives attached numbers. mean people insensitive, naturally harder emphasize people personally know. crime Australia. includes acts committed overseas well crime arrange take child overseas Australian resident overseas may include maximum 7-21 years prison.

Yeah, nothing done stop it. posts headline 

### 1[5 L.A. County children sickened rare coronavirus-related inflammatory eh? I’ll leave Talk doctor. Yeah exactly. even sure placebo probably works even better ;)  Yup got **Surgeon general** \- *""Donald Trump healthier am""* OMG people still going jobs remotely?! problem counties within states making masks mandatory. needs nationwide federal mandate masks, needs enforceable. business doesn’t heavily enforce masks temporarily shut do. know ""How organization support employees Covid?"" forever list interview questions potential employers. I've referring Clevons Sorry wanted purpose thats little bit cryptic. mixed bad english maybe difficult get. do, done without costing lives. one calling school cancelled. Especially poor / lack robust education we're mess.  safety basically proven already first stage. second stage prove effectiveness.

Not rare side effects show large scale testing, exactly completely untested vaccine point. headline news. God damn don’t smart ass share expertise I’d thought people worked university would actually keen share information without prompted point agitation. 

Also it’s Reddit global website available everyone ranging kids pensioners you’re fool expecting people reply knowledgable anything. 

Look, originally posted appeared unfounded nothing boiled glory days behind us, called provided additional information. actually good Reddit exchange, you’re cunt it.  argument vaccine might ready next year depends failing phase 3 correct? passes phase 3 already millions doses manufactured working vaccine. 

Also link treatment failing phase 3, vaccine. wish could birthday party April too. That’s probably healthcare workers though. I’ve read general population would gain access early 2021. Idk *late* 2021 though. hope... bright
Edit: need lay you? Seriously people- STOP BUYING MASKS!  **They effective preventing general public catching** healthcare providers can’t get care sick patients, puts communities risk! 

Jerome Adams - Feb 2020  inventor 3 sons going drug trials. insisted faith mum sounds like third world citizenry governed first world millionaires. 

Definitely shameful sad place. [It would seem everyone agrees Ohio robots cute hats  Wow outfits Trump promoting miraculously going vaccines ready November election. convenient hence stay! illegally download vaccine, would you? ...But never late negative spin CTE probably negatively affects much higher % players covid ever Yeah read article, says families take girl's back countries came get done. anything stop actual issue Australia you?

If really want talk genital mutilation every country allowing transsexuals mutilate genitals?

The whole point talking genital mutilation Australia. talking American sex French prostitute. Please try stay focused future... Ya.....good point. preliminary research schools countries shown young children less likely infect family members either adults older children. makes little less risky. People also developed things like COVID hugs. 

But parents decision, adults. I’ve boat. applied job field, later noticed 1100 applicants!  Lately I’ve wondering resume junk, many people. 

I wish luck search! want use talking point outbreaks dem controled large cities. Also governors elected popular vote gives edge future. wear mask already, like covid thing would go work question feeling like covid thing want right thing best can. “Because Winn Dixie” disturbing number people either believe virus exists like flu. There's also huge number think God going protect decided time die it. even people think virus real think lockdowns, masks, etc much God. maddening. that?

They papering fact Trump nowhere near coherent coronavirus. Trump's petty mercurial spats would embarrassing admitted reality lie make like there's two sides. Soccer tickets? game? 2021 2022? fine right? mean clearly people charge plan right? Thats reopened right? plans place situations like right? means trump vaccinated guess Can't wait charge $1000/dose version  always Myrtle Beach. towns cesspool disease year. even drive pandemic. Churches fuckin decent society ""see ICU *from bed*"" EMS crews responding 3 calls per shift taking roughly 4 hrs get patients ER. line ambulances outside waiting get patients unloaded. Haha Kemp De Santis giving real run money. Gonna photo finish, methinks. I'm confused. say they've read reports people getting reinfected last several months say information conclusive. forgot PARENTS GRANDPARENTS. uk, noticed figures 1000 day, inconceivable couldn’t feel anything fear family. it’s 11 day, feels like there’s 11 families mourning loved one. 

You almost can’t feel relief getting worst, families. goes answer. come back. remember back April walking street opposite side guy sitting car coughing really loudly every seconds. Sounded terrible. stop earshot. idea had, surprised corona. Nope. They've censoring data months now. probably going eat sugar anyway. Might well help humanity I'm it. people least get say goodbyes. Usually people die conscious. virus sick today dead tomorrow, little time people say goodbyes. So... still nowhere bad America's? love biotech pumps. Predictable suckers rally, every single time. I'm banking every time happens. even read estimated 53,000 women girls born overseas living Australia undergone female genital mutilation lifetime, data released Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Wednesday found.

And EU commision FGM
 whole point something legal country done, make right. sources talking bad FGM is, despite legal overseas.  Man, gets high 90s, even 100 degrees wit 80-90% humidity Ontario Quebec good chunk summer days. new normal. Winters -25 last November - April, get two weeks spring heatwaves end september. really nice weeks september early october though. mean guarantee madden season regular season gets cancelled. that’s obviously thing vast majority people won’t care left permanently disabled. work job move lot, look new profession. That’s big problem pandemic. take care probably millions people new chronical diseases? mention economical damage. “doctor” said Trump probably shape president time. stopped listening that. soon call LARP wait that? Definitely soon lose fake internet points, watch constitutional article, specifically? Practically said wrong.

Oxford ahead anyone - least 1 month.

And works well safe, October time quite realistic emergency approval. call? tell? government us.  Welcome Missourah, 51% people can’t even pronounce name state properly

Misery. That's pronounce it. Usually ""fuckin"" hand. in, live fuckin misery. really going split hairs currency sake discussion? Dr. Fauci said masks help, gets pass. terrible track record Defence Dark Arts. Thread reader: Lol Sorry trouble caused sharing problems, yes maybe right. could saved money prepare this. probably fault, hate able help family pay anything. already know abunch girls posting ultrasounds IG huge falling partners  Cuz heard early safe whatever. That's observation though. learn shit prep next one.

Oh I've learned.  I'm going keep box n95's around. Make sure never run low lysol wipes hand soap.  guess need install bidet keep 6months TP well. hope fine comb loaning process later see frauds.  worth noting UK, countries responsible rollout strategies.

I agree though, plan be. Hahahahaha haha people worst Neither I.

Find said worthless whole. wont.

My actual position unless actually starting caring quality masks worn think blanket mask requirements done placebo effect masses.

Some may buy it, see dude face thong chin mask store make feel like protected. 

Many people put face thong feel ""they good"" leads adjust behaviors could direct impact stopping spread virus. border closed, hope open somehow flatten curve see decrease cases uptick recovery. 

I can't speak everyone, seem collective disbelief regards resistance we've seen towards science, health officials, even empathetic coexistence. 

Intentional loaded word, mean fall conspiracy territory. look peaceful riots handled country last months alongside mismanagement covid America hard see leadership solely focused control. Again. means saying true. voicing anxiety back head often rationalize away. 

Thanks asking Oxford Vaccine... America Vaccine... USAVIOR Cure... whatever want call it. lot names. many names... buttermilk’s make great bouldering basically closest town full services high eastern Sierra. get it’s popularity climbers.

Man hot town though Yeah, live, I've seen one place require mask, usually find people wearing masks except crowded indoor areas like malls. COVID rates minimal. biggest threat Americans infecting us.

I still bring around me, I've felt need use outside crowded areas areas old folks children. America hand... Straight up, science behind mask effectiveness preventing COVID-19 dubious. Ah right, fault. Figured happened: checked midnight comparing Monday yesterday fault. Also checked last night worldometer definitely 60k day: maybe added extra cases overnight.

Thanks double checking Colorado put mask mandate.

My Wal-Mart went 50/50 lot nose-outers chinguards 100% (except one guy getting kicked out) improperly worn.

Either changed behavior staying home. I'm fine both. ""muh freedoms"" 

Guy wore MAGA hat video made respond this....

Sorry 'benefit doubt' goes window point. dad last week, good outside playing football. Keep hopes bud! Rooting mom! It’s choice Lancet, Oxford AstraZenica, release research papers. 2019 ""Injections, hate them!"" 

&amp;#x200B;

2020 ""Just stick anywhere Doc!!"" truly fragile, COVID-19 infection could death sentence,”

Aka fragile stop living life. long develop immunity?

I already see bunch idiots going straight bars pubs immediately receiving vaccine.  work way. war victory cornavirus surrenders date time. little bit news time. trickle towards victory fully know working like till couple months used. Fuck making read stupid thing think realise source is. source proffesor **1 source** repeat "" going 1 source, links oxford vaccine therefore knowing full information, tempering expectation (which important stop people forget social distancing)"".

Anyway 'childish insult' go outside get fresh air clearly rendered unable type complete sentance.

If talking Oxford vaccine source linked earlier. didn't... actual link  Trump puppet Russia
Edit: incoming bot downvotes True, UK leading latest breakthrough including dexamethasone, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, Intereferon Beta! signed deal Russia? That's high. fever headache, could considered small, short-term side effect saving lot lives. Sounds kinda Umbrella Corporation-y promises... can't both? calling vaccine different name make less effective somehow?  layman way explaining mRNA heard essentially throws instructions/blueprints create antibodies cells. stated first comment, flux people needs intensive care low, daily death rate almost zero. reliable data. ""new"" cases 100% sure. get virus? test 100%? dont know that. 

Summer vacation right now, mean Norwegian researchers data show things going short time spann? dont think so, anything, statistics get even lower future summer vacation lower rate new cases !  


No reason Sweden claims herd immunity statistics show. show it, Swedes neglecting social distancing time rates go down. tell you? HELL FREAKING YEAH!!!!? Thanks encouraging giving motivation move forward. Yes, read wrote. understand take hard work prepared that. 

But, kind viewpoint fulfills agenda someone doesnt want people speak fight change all. I'll make sure print comment reminder keep pushing forward, despite pessimists/ defeatists say.

Thanks motivation. huge W humanity Ehh, right. still rule unconstitutional, delay stall pandemic over. Takes cases trickle SCOTUS anyways, lower court rules mandate, issue stay guess. Bizarre indeed Well know US lowest death rate world /s care groups size chance covid case basically 100% depending locality? county odds go 50% group 20 people. 100 people it’s 99%. don’t know I’m shocked anymore. He’s Fenian. course loves France. I’m Francoskeptic. Pritzker seems decent far least. Antibodies aren’t signal immunity. Antibodies produced memory B-cells, generally see levels drop within months inoculation. biggest thing Oxford CanSino shown cellular response among Memory B-Cells good old T-Cells, always last years years allowable bodies challenge infection another instance fine tradition Swedish officials wildly overestimating population immunity

So saying infection spread low, even though lockdown? 5 upvotes vitriol one 3 China.

100k upvotes Oxford one.

200k Moderna last quote says all. Yeah even study saying face shields effective. listed like 5 medical conditions. woman clinging fragile life here, lol   part operation warpspeed. AstraZeneca producing 300 million doses us already People think convenient relationship better relationship lol. one lose right vote. ONE. can't ask people stop robbing, stop hitting other, stop killing other, stop stealing.

Stop asking people wear mask, start enforcing people wear mask.

This game, pandemic. US one worst countries world vs pandemic.

Unpopular opinion: China right force residents wear masks Open beaches, pop!
It's virus, come on, turn up

Hear cough door pandemic begins

This Florida dumb come in

Update will, notify next kin

It's cold, baby, gonna sick.

We stay in

No travel, stay live

Yeah, beat this

But gotta stay in, in

Welcome house

Keep masks right now

Gotta get virus slow down

We go ""Clearly can't cut costs pay taxes! Axe poor!"" Doesnt matter, happening well. friend needs back surgery cant get it. Delayed month dont know able I'm fine that. mean, course want get vaccinated, let's give first need it.

I'd also add essential front-line workers (everyone First Responders grocery-store employees) list. Maybe we'll finally get one coronavirus killing cats. :( Technically one work works poorly. Noob question:
Why would UK order 100m doses population 66m?

Edit: Someone answered comments already. Ah yes needs pay rent/mortgage buy food pay get one beautiful insurance plan pay thousands meet deductible get coverage denied $500 tylenol tablet. Woohoo! Lol @ majestic equality. pay? should. vertical line still flat! Trump 90000 IQ play, keep US numbers high test vaccine stage 3, find easy efficacy results. Hi!

I'm representative Trump administration. demonstrated high level understanding situation would like offer position running coronavirus response. Please call 800-867-5309 discuss opportunity, thanks! Mistake. Republican states need freedumbs. Unfortunately pool testing works actively trying mitigate spread. Dude stood Trump told tale mow wants talk reality? Yikes. Yes, BMI considered overweight, Body fat % obese. 32% body fat according last time calculated. 

BMI great general information working population data, body fat % accurate. vote, matter.

So population votes, solid 30% extremely ignorant many care investment portfolios. know misread title thought Karen got 100k wanted donate half barista.

Hope silly thing. yet someone thread said teaching survival. keep asking it?

Extra scary getting children involved politics going act like cant get virus spread it

If said teachers really kids, would whatever could increase risk exposure Hide behind machismo, everyone falls down, ask except help stay down. idea lone wolves everything myth. square species. always animals strong connections one another. weaknesses, strengths. There's shame asking help need people love you. you.

USA far worst making even feeble attempt come together country mitigate thing.

It's like we're country largely populated bumpkins.

Best  28 50 states, DC PR mandated masks. problem, like law, people choose whether follow it. *this* zombie apocalypse happens? I've calling ""Carl""... step-dad. sounds lot like environment Soviet Union leading collapse. pretend work, pay us... call mooks. Thats UK afaik, Two Billion thats order rest world. Sadly, led information trying implement mandatory masks, probably would higher compliance rate. paraphrase Jesus Christ:

[""The stupid always saves ICU might work cheaper.

Still feel bad guys worry costs :/ That's know end one works timeline, name memeable. certainly possible got false negative, rate transmission spouses 30%-60%. See ""Household Secondary Attack Rate"" research data. counter-intuitive lot people (including me) article really helped understand unevenness spread: **""Why COVID-19 patients infect many others, whereas don’t spread virus all?""** "" Without social distancing, reproduction number (R) three. real life, people infect many others others don’t spread disease all. fact, latter norm, Lloyd-Smith says: “The consistent pattern common number zero. people transmit.” "" whole, states like Texas brought ice trucks act makeshift morgues.

NY's huge hit skewed numbers prior months. virus still deadly deaths increasing...but deaths mainly seem take hospitals overwhelmed. USA! USA! USA! NUMBER 1 WOOOOOO Yeah actually think really young kids much better. Smaller schools, smaller classes, spend day one teacher one set classmates, parents much protective age, even ones thrilled restrictions masks probably need daycare aspect bad enough comply.

High school hand...high school disaster unless area gets new case numbers almost nothing. Lol that’s sad

Why don’t people keep second accounts Gonewild like normal people already proven safe MERs SARs form? thought effectiveness thing question.  I'm healthy single male. Cobra would cost 400/mo. Lol North Carolina nasal swab test I’m going say right one would think far nose needs shoved. sure I’d correctly myself. people join tests like this? Hold horses hoss, lot vaccine candidates need see phase III data first going take ~6mo minimum preliminary results could ft Campbell mandated though people riot things become violent. starting think government wants happen. pandemic needs end, let´s go Oxford! Yup. It’s law Texas, be. seen secret police rounding people unmarked vans, right? Black Death 1300’s: sever quarantine/lockdown, faster economy recovered lower ratio deaths  Drunk driving laws better analogy. risk you, stupid decision engage risky behavior putting everyone else risk. it! USA #1! USA #1! put US first finally #1! Frightening think “final call” might mean stunted, evil mind. Sounds reminiscent something... REGISTRY screening people willing consider volunteering. So, gathering baseline info. sure actual studies offer stipend. studies Phase 3 started yet USA. case need minimum 500,000 registry begin enough *suitable* participants vaccine(s) ready.

Took 8 min sign registry. Thank you, OP! Ha! It’s pretty incredible. best case scenario stuff we’re looking here. vaccine available September widely available new year, achievement par Moon Landing development nuclear weapons. Absolutely incredible humans collaborate. That's great dude! harvest supplement rations nationwide food shortages. I'm sorry brother dumb...I family also afflicted mlm ready September take well year American’s get it. * Greed: Demanding half money nothing.
* Cruelty: Demanding right harm kill others anti-masking bullshit.
* Selfishness: Unable inconvenienced mask.
* Deception: Lying medical exemption. I've calling Jack. keep seeing SoCal celebrities/Influencers traveling state weekend getaway. possible? thought LA/SD growing cases awhile, enough prevent travel SoCal? last Influencer saw post necessary travel fresh air Mexico, said okay safe according CDC. 100% see issue it. I'm sure truly believed desperate get LA. 
I've also seeing influencers/youtubers LA following practicing Shelter Place/ Social distancing. kinda eerie see SoCal go back normal cases continue increase. 

Maybe I'm missing something, possible different regions CA receiving different guidelines? almost like SoCal got green light go back normal. stop bothering label deaths. look excess deaths compared normal seasons count backwards. We’ll he’s charged country. downplayed virus since day one, doesnt wear mask mandate mask. pushed states open early did. average 70 thousand cases day whole european union 440 million averages around 5 thousand cases. runs country. things well wants credit things go wrong fault, got it! write this, South Carolina’s COVID-19 cases continue surge, first child five die COVID-19, ICU beds becoming full capacity, facing shortages rapid testing capabilities, drugs, ventilators extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) circuits point ethics committees set help tough decisions treatment allocation. children critically ill COVID-19 children’s hospitals, including multisystem inflammatory syndrome. seeing increasing number pregnant women seriously ill COVID-19 cared adult ICUs – comes increase number premature births due severe maternal COVID-19 illness. babies neonatal intensive care units negative pressure COVID rooms, separated parents. appreciate morbidity mortality associated premature births, know effects COVID-19 developing brain fetus, infant, child. call shit laughable man. absolute dice roll even outside typical risk factors. fucking waaay people killing point. That's goddamn right. mean really /s far current trends...

At current rate 80K week, stand 363K (total infected including visitors) - hit half million mid-early August

Reference: that's good one too. Wendys recently Long Island :/ ""Masks give acne""

""The smell breath offends me""

""I can't find mask matches outfit""

""People able see new lipstick mouth covered""

""Wearing mask slightly uncomfortable whatever reason, even though they're uncomfortable literally everyone, discomfort somehow \~different\~"" ""Side effects"" simple soreness arm vaccine (I've never gotten vaccine without experiencing this) catastrophic, right. worse. food shortages, unemployment ensuing anarchy due people's desperation, 2022, America's cities unrecognizable. Bodies fill streets, skyscrapers torn ground, remain saunter around, hardly would call ""human"" affected virus.  Governor: “The Earth flat”. reminds quote says something effect ""Americans always right thing trying everything else.""  Well, think even need papers say masks reduce transmission respiratory disease. possible doubt range little effective extremely effective. fair, one cost lives tens thousands americans already, on-track make hundreds thousands. standout versus rest shit, I'm confident he's capable even greater damage. fatality rate somewhere 1-2%. 0.5 we'd barely register this, 5-10% would freaking fuck out. buy auto store often install you. mean side note history books? happening. Also majority history books produce one company Texas, [two versions history 1559 8477 reported tests (18.4% positivity)  happy see progress like always makes nervous it’s Chinese company. president hasn’t exactly put “sharing caring” vibe sure happen another country, especially China, develops vaccine have. *woosh* Virginia canceled/delayed fall high school sports. Amen that. Accept now, weekends boring suck. statement seems got wings own. report analysis done reasoning make, 

I thought supposed evidenced based speculation based? Hm. know 17-20 percent antibodies. 

No don't. highest % 17ish that's non-random skewed sample. studies Karolinska Institutet places T-cell component mean best count twice much, like said, Carlson tells TT.

You know seen? retraction either giant FHM supporting groups Facebook. OTOH, original statement Sweden might 40% quite popular. work: make bold, unsupportable proclamations go viral corrections make nearly much impact. Last Monday: 1357 cases, 8 deaths. increase. Edgy..  C places call ask help. nothing worth dying making others sick, unless there. they’re cheating. would like calling 9/11 deaths “aviation accidents.” Even flu vaccine side effects. point vaccine. make immune system recognize it. /r/nottheonion honestly criminal. monkeys given extremely high dose virus party I'll die want to. Die want to. Die want to. would die happened yooouuu.

Edit: seriousness, hope come them. Please stop throwing parties, people. Also, there's good chance lot British abroad come home vaccine well surplus. Thank sir! Also must say kick ass username, retreating discworld quite bit since madness started. Rolling exposed individuals would intelligent way stop pandemic.  tend agree. get hard people. I’m going swim laps back forth Florida Texas. Surely, don’t assume 60% get vaccine, either availability personal beliefs like fear vaccine developed tested 8-9 months (I would probably fall category), simply people anti vaxxers... pay, security benefits. essentially Guinea Pig.

I'm anti vaxxer, caution said sign novel virus really lot info on. Let alone side effects medication could be.

That, recurrent amount covid cases someone catching reassuring. That’s makes plausible lmfao need wear mask video? media’s job essentially promote fear gain public compliance. believe read bottleneck getting vaccine syringes still looks good.

I think ""widespread"" sense means everybody go doctors office get shot (like one measles, mumps rubella). 

Healthcare workers, cleaning staff, essential workers, teachers, etc. (those high exposition risk frequent shit ton people daily life) probably get first, high risk group made available rest population. People Hell want ice water. would agree health code like cleanliness, rodent/insect infestation improperly stored food restaurant located yeah license needs go. sources this? Could please stick legitimate sources rather clickbait? think [this](http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN90906759?q=phase%20II%20covid-19&amp;filters=trialStatus:Ongoing&amp;sort=&amp;offset=9&amp;totalResults=13&amp;page=1&amp;pageSize=10&amp;searchType=basic-search) study want, results published yet cohort expanded 5-70+. Scroll interventions. Groups 2 3. ~~To fair~~ agree, officials (at least FL) mandating mask usage immediately saying enforce mandate... instead leaving personal responsibility follow mandates. trying convince you, beyond that. Instead spreading misinformation refuse provide sources for. rightfully calling bullshit that. 

But alas, sources provided. confirmed wrote bs made up. I'm glad region, northeast US, right thing. can't control Trump does. still control state does, work together neighboring states solve problem. mean basically ""do something"", federal government done basically nothing far. fact, done worse nothing, spread false information masks make worse, President recommended drinking bleach... resulted multiple deaths

The US never successfully handled pandemic. 2009 H1N1 pandemic, federal state governments done absolutely nothing. Lucky mild pandemic term death rates. Self induced lobotomy cultivating political ideas many years exposure. think 1.2B bought US like 300 million doses least right buy 300 million doses. Im mentally preparing this. People work already convinced virus hoax , openly said way Gates chip us. 

Its gonna come companies requiring vaccination continued employment. happens leader White House cult people hang onto every word says everyone else, including medical professionals, lying them. Exactly - can't even say secret televised games cause fans show party outside. manage form putting security risk.
Its nuts think NFL CFB happen fall.. High schools... said nothing yet around idea waiting besides cases. make excellent points rural people, think anyone would disagree lightly populated areas able make lot decisions. Neither party serves well serve themselves.

But suburbanites think they're rugged individualists cookie-cutter ranch houses McMansions. want conveniences city life without willing make concessions required everything close proximity people.

It's one thing Jim see point wearing mask monthly visit feed store, run cousin saw last week. something else Susie Suburbanite meltdown asked wear mask goes get weekly mani-pedi. would love confidence execution Oxford researchers. They’ve saying they’ll September almost year. always assumed Texas could become hot bed covid. Like hate people Texas bull headed want told do, especially government.  believe throws phase 3 actually Ok, specific valid criticism. 

Much calling people think everyone wearing face thong worthwhile inbred idiot plague Walker. (Which illicited original response) Beaches must die for. phase 4 (post-release) = rare/long term side effects (this phase never truly ends)

This phase concerning me. predict long-term side effects couple months? Serious question, anyone insight I'd like hear it! read That's good one. like it. Here... cookie. Maybe bots? low test results always Monday thing, important thing point downward hospitalization trends across board (current inpatients, ICU, ER visits). objectively good news state. party. BLM protest. really want get front jury trial would absolutely hilarious. likely get thrown though long that. Yeah thought would fine playing fortnight day anxiety hypochondria cam full force time wandering around house scared there’s something wrong me, hell. school opens, go back get fired. Getting fired benefit kids school all, fewer teachers class sizes increase compensate puts everyone school larger risk addition overall worse environment learning. Getting fired certainly benefit teacher, fired cause cannot even collect unemployment. kids still concern personal situation recognizing ""everyone loses"" outcome. acting like never seen issue everyone's lives simple straightforward solutions. I'm sorry, ""if cared kids would gladly abandon entire career pay enough give safety net go get fucked reality looking entirely new life right now"" reasonable standards. That's opposite experience gotten - grand majority negative. positive ones exception, partly good news sell much. 

In either case, one go international articles Sweden see thing I'm talking about. articles getting petty past-focused time.  second bring unionization recordable way gain lot protections.

If fired things happened prior start unionization would easy win lawsuit.

This already established, chance punish wasnt important company started union stuff.

Of course, second mention everything scrutinized second fuck gone isnt really helpful, unless happen like stated. ""hot spot area""? Also good drug seems already use, means major safety concerns presumably already adressed. Sure makes sense.

I think meant ask percentage patients overweight? know experience anecdotal, I'm curious seen end, always kneel.  reading right? CDC updated estimated IFR 0.65% symptomatic IFR 0.40% couple months ago? seems like significant change found about.

 Yeah, say Placerville. seems completely reasonable makes lot sense honest.  wish true...  agree. might way get people. Also stories loved ones dying alone hospital. mean think saying there. bar trying clear Brazil India. guess America really needs made great time around. work dozen cases stemmed Florida vacations... luckily test everyone returning work don’t let people return get test results. Although county wants employers stop testing way. I'm arguing Texas growing significantly cases. I'm also saying Europe booming cases. look charts. Spain, Austria, Switzerland, Croatia, Serbia...keep going see cases picking areas. Why? opened past 4-8 weeks. natural consequence opening up.

Yes, locking keep cases low even away. soon open, matter is, cases grow. another lock putting fact off. posted dozens times already. think continues issue privilege. BLM, people saying Lives Matter great privilege refuse acknowledge it. People protest masks assault rifles people great privilege refuse acknowledge it. person great privilege, angers people privilege simply want argue argument's sake. wanted listen, would understand, rather, operate whataboutism want find reason discredit anything agree with, hence, saying Lives Matter harmless simply say Black Lives Matter \*we performed 30% worse bad flu season **yet, extreme measures taken.** work car dealership service department it’s scary many people can’t come pick cars test results came back positive. fuck would public waiting corona virus results.

I never heard ColomiaReports, looks like news website directed Expats living Colombia. Easter, gonna disappear...

It’s finally warm north time year need account dicks actually symptoms go anyway blaming allergic reaction something (like Crazy Disney Lady).

I doubt people different states states hit.

I suspect geographic factors play brought virus areas higher concentrations.

So yes - vaccine/herd immunity going way. yes - effective vaccine herd immunity, could drag while. Now, viruses tend mutate, could theoretically mutate impact humans impact much. That's possibility too. Although agree statement, also convinced immigration removes issue. 

5% people EU non-EU countries.
Around 675k people became EU citizens non-eu countries 2018.
There 5m births Europe per year (roughly), add immigration numbers, think could work :P 

This number ramp-up EU turns away China looks bring back industry, goes greener. least one would hope. definition triage, can’t first say doesn’t happen give example say doesn’t count lol.

I honestly think bit different thing. Triage say ""We could treat old guy could treat young guy. going treat young guy.""

When issue ""We could treat old guy high chance treatment actually kill him, could treat young guy"" .. feel *slightly* covid happen 28 days infection average

Hold on, let go get people talking see they're interested visiting website reading comment... would agree incubation rate day, much people drive Texas, coupled incubation rate two weeks, think spread slower NY, less severe. It'll get really really really bad, take longer.

Also, NY deaths upstate, much rural spread out. must nice considered human country. country perhaps taking American refugees? guy hardly savings... yes everything said   US, CDC implies true infection around 10x reported # cases. since 4m, true infection around 40m ish so. Sweden's FHM offer anything similar? Sweden's true infection burden line country like US, since they're pretty much deviants strategy herd immunity? equivelent someone saying parents got diagnosed cancer saying ""Wow, 44% people die life sucks afterwards"" American moving Austria month here.

I’m Florida too. got tested 3/20 took 3.5 weeks get results.... gets quarantined. 30. think 25 tested beforehand (my employer tests everyone return work working home) couple random testing. 
These mostly people that, advice, went vacation town - including quite Florida vacations. got family members. leadership. Elections consequences. keep trying tell people that's matter life death people like go around believing virus affects medical issues (mostly fat people). want acknowledge even though young healthy people survive, mean 100℅ better risk permanent organ damage. 103 fever July 3rd. Tested 4th July. Fever continued around 102-103 6th. headache week either end. almost symptoms.

July 14th test comes back negative. 10 days result.

If Covid, hell it?? never flu summer life, plus got flu vaccine. wear mask everywhere, hardly go anywhere.

My test nostril swab, brain tickler. Loose QTips ""to save money"". 

Who's say samples sitting hot truck day two 10 days took result? would test results?

I feeling lot false negatives. Missouri giant swamp? think he’s stupid then? misleading. I'm hospital employee South Florida. 

Average age hospitalized going down... average age hospitalized *with COVID* not. 

The reason hospital occupancy age going due fact resumed elective surgeries. March/April basically allowed COVID patients building. everyone come almost anything.

The average age COVID patients remains extremely high. statement correct I'm sure sarcastic.

These Chinese cities millions people get dozen new cases then, every time, massively increase testing shut transport gatherings / impose quarantine isolation measures.

That exactly keep explode millions cases. see it, hard yards early possible, whack moles pretty effectively.

The opposite strategy (like USA) get tens thousands new cases daily, exploding population. Again, that’s article about. It’s overreaching cause collapse society. Spreading thin. correct though, society collapses dollar goes it.  *Instructions unclear; dick stuck COVID-19.* Judging Apple's Mobility data Sweden, seems country pretty much 'moved on' virus, impression I'm getting. think want enjoy summer holiday there, rather real desire contain virus. Hence, fair expect one big continual wave there, similar US much controlled fashion. remember nothing fundamentally changed. People largely vulnerable start year. Complacency exceptionally dangerous vaccine rolled out. data mysteriously disappear. No, really? look Trump cult member,

I got lucky remembered location doesn’t ever seem busy publicized reason walked got test. would faster forgot pen go buy one. thought one, didn’t. Remember bring pen fill form. came back line 10 ppl long. still maybe 20 minute wait that’s all. come point hyper-vigilant ones left.

I replying absurd statement.  I’m grateful larger store chains are, know several people say refuse shop won’t wear mask. It’s maddening especially since wearing mask simple easy. Stubbornness runs strong here. I'd definitely seek chased government crimes humanity.

You always go get antibody test see. Would nice know “On way to...” would even grammatically correct. White House press secretary said become state rights issue (you know, like slavery war northern aggression).

I’ve worn one since March past week I’ve felt people reacting differently bc announcement £100 fine wearing them. Hope fines strongly enforced. ""lockdown"" half arsed best.. even stringent stay home orders U.S half measures compared countries actually seeing great success due right. Worked essential retail business whole thing number people treated like vacation went shopping trips whole family lack mask wearing example stay home orders would likely blow mind. Bottom line matter serious people take even minority ignore basic safety precautions continue spread it. Ideally would around 80% higher vaccinated.

But seen anti-mask crowd I'm skeptical go high.

Honestly feel federal mandate everyone get vaccine. choice allowed unless literally immune system. yet. also depends kind mask course. currently public transport Netherlands wearing cotton (1 layer) ill-fitting mask. legal.

Heck, even small town school system 5,000 students (K-12) see 1-2 dead students.

To answer questions (correct I’m wrong) vaccine already development another type coronavirus while. tweaked work broadly call “coronavirus” (I forget scientific name. huge head start. skip rush safety trials. Safety trials vaccines rigorous. 

There needs massive educational initiative sides media explaining many people properly informed. studies shown 1/3 Americans won’t want take first batch. isn’t due solely anti-vax, it’s people think safety trials rushed don’t facts. 

Another problem panic antibodies may last long enough, despite conflicting evidence fact producing antibodies one part immune response cells could help reinfections much les severe. 

TLDR - People poorly informed need fix make work I'm Greenville, South Carolina. go Walmart today pick prescription. (I would delivered, bc particulars insurance... can't.)

The store damn crowded. People social distance. fact store cut hours much help crowds.

I see lot people shopping frivolous items what's hands carts. long line bag chips, beer, sandals- probably could stayed home reduced risk.

Lots people wearing masks. people wearing them, lots noses sticking mask completely around chin.

E: sorry, forgot smallpox vaccine early polio vaccine. 

Vaccinia horrible bug, terrible side effects kills unborn children occasional adult. 

The early Salk vaccine gave polio millions children Africa due problem producing large scale (incomplete mixing inactivating agent wasn’t problem laboratory scale) It’s really slippery slope....scary fact. big election coming Huzzah! advertising information. Dude, seen people try wrangle? wouldn’t count unable catch again. It’s certainly looking like it’s possibility. Stay safe! saw well current administration distributed masks, PPE, respirators testing kits. Jared gets hold it, we’re doomed. 

With little less hyperbole, stunningly bad managing distribution essential medical supplies. Front lines government officials would first, followed elderly, military, public service likely general public, maybe storefront workers first. fuck would wear mask home alone? get that. understand statistic thing good people die, there's good people around. Good people dying means literally less good people. Someone good longer us  in, disease spreads people! Weirder things happened cursed year I’ve seen fake news... David Carpenter quoted article? Also can’t find similar reporting UK source... Guardian said three days ago earlier trail end end year. Let know looked wrong places. India US people... please wake up... I’ve seen people discredit try undermine every bit good news say “no, stay doors, expect last well 2021 maybe even 2022, anyone thinks ends sooner lying themselves!” 

I think that's real thing. 

 think there's small vocal subgroup subreddit go every post good news say ""Here comes naysayers!"" never show actually exist. 

The people think exist bad numbers want see everything good news. get corrected mistakenly parse something good news wrongly assume person ""just negative"" ""rooting failure"". 

I've bucket cold water times subreddit see premature celebration (such flawed studies hydroxychloroquine discredited) I've right every time. **I'm negative; I'm realist**. hard tell two apart sometimes, one based negative outlook fact-based. happen overlap sometimes. positive evidence overwhelmingly reason positive. However see news positive specific cold water throw it--other fact would caution banking anyone outcome (negative positive) still lot uncertainty. think fully possible vaccine could come along next 6-9 months end thing without many hiccups. 

I certainly want believe happen definitely believe **can** happen. hardly guarantee either. ""negative"" people subreddit, believe exist. think can't recognize difference realist cynic. There's lot artificial pushes towards casting negative things positive fake ""good"" news one side political spectrum really wants ""spin"" whole thing. think dangerous let get swept away **want** believe hard evidence stands it. 83% statistics made spot. remember reading article (in April maybe) stated US currently 2% syringes necessary dispense vaccine nationally, could take 2 years get enough needles vaccinate everybody. 

Does still apply?   sure, I'm one people concerned. Personally, I'll watching response Europe closely, trust US government - there's much political pressure find silver bullet election here.

That said, even Europe, outbreak bad, would expect see normal calculus 'how much risk acceptable rush vaccine out?' pretty different usual, I'd expect see governments medical personnel ready usual risk serious side effects push effective vaccine many people possible. always never vote one way I’m open hear likely vaccine change every trial phase? 

Might speculatively ramping production now, clears phase three august/september 50 150 million doses already coming pipeline production scale-up place already? 

Normally would absurd overcost course, situation, vaccine chance stay uniform trials, entirely reasonable risk hundred million dollars. might ramping initial production info coming tomorrow solid enough

They beg help. flail. eyes fill terror.

“We people sitting bed they’re breathing like they’re running marathon full speed,” said Dr. Adupa Rao, pulmonologist critical-care specialist Keck Hospital USC.

“They’re breathing fast deep, they’re trying catch breath,” Rao said. “It’s almost like you’re watching goldfish water, gasping get air, never get enough.”

Manny Khodadadi, emergency-room nurse USC Verdugo Hills Hospital, described scene nearly identical terms.

For patients, “it’s like water trying swim toward top can’t get nose top water,” Khodadadi said.

He’s ER nurse 10 years working paramedic ambulance driver, Khodadadi described virus invisible enemy, hospitals battlefields. recalls one surge patients rushed convalescent homes. Many foggy, altered states, unable provide names basics. days flow patients brisk constant, mildly ill panic.

“They struggle, try get bed, try pull things leave.... may even saying, ‘Help me, help me, help me. can’t breathe. Help me,’ ” Khodadadi said. “They say, ‘Save life, now.’ many words, without words. way look you. want grab you, magic medicine could give them, wish did.”

It didn’t way. United States nearly twice many COVID-19 deaths next closest country five months failed national leadership, haphazard local policies testing, tracing reopening, widespread public resistance basic, simple precautions could saved lives.

The anticipated summer lull instead become summer surge, record-setting numbers new cases California elsewhere. (Remember President Trump predicted confidently warm weather would kill virus?)

And yet still see mind-boggling resistance change. days ago, backyard, Orange County Board Education recommended schools reopen without masks distancing.

Would act differently us lost someone, cared risk we’re exposing healthcare workers to? test positive end recovering, might one reason blase attitudes. would take pandemic seriously knew it’s like die COVID-19 death?

Hard say, asked healthcare providers describe see day emergency rooms intensive care units, let tell you, don’t want experience virus.

“One unfortunate things we’re seeing ICU people getting better like anticipate get better,” Rao said.

That’s despite treatments include high-dose oxygen, ventilators, lung-bypass machines, blood thinners prevent clots attack organs cause great pain, steroids reduce inflammation lungs. advanced stages, sickest patients least mercy sedated.

“I think unspoken tragedy whole COVID experience loss humanity toward end someone’s life,” Rao said. “We used ability loved ones passing away. people passing away isolation.”

In one case, dentist whose son physician colleague Rao’s died COVID-19 without son getting chance hold father’s hand say goodbye face face.

“This last week,” Rao said, “I intubate 56-year-old man kidney transplant, prior intubation able see wife doorway, could see eyes thinking, ‘This may last time get speak her.’ ”

I met Rao outside Keck Hospital short break 12-hour shift. said COVID unit seven critically ill patients moment, including mother gave birth two months ago another went respiratory failure delivering. seven patients, two 20s five 30s 60s.

Rao said also six seven COVID patients somewhat less critical condition.

“The experience suffering takes completely new tenor” COVID, said Dr. Sunita Puri, Keck palliative-care specialist author “That Good Night: Life Medicine Eleventh Hour.” “Now we’re facilitate goodbyes iPads.”

Ordinarily explains typical characteristics disease benefits risks medical procedures, Puri said, discussion complicated little doctors know coronavirus. reason, Puri said, families conversations — it’s late — procedures patients willing endure limitations they’re willing live with.

Palliative medicine strives offer comfort dignity possible critically ill patients, families still struggle determine whether life extended death prolonged. Puri said critical COVID patients pronated special beds attempt reoxygenate damaged lungs, side effects extreme.

“The pressure buildup fluids cause parts face parts body fluff off,” Puri said. It’s “kind grotesque,” added, it’s difficult even medical staff witness.

Khodadadi told convalescent home employee 30s arrived ambulance full cardiac arrest.

“We CPR, worked him, everything,” said Khodadadi, young man died.

“We understand war here. dealing enemy microscopic, something can’t see,” Khodadadi said. “If World War II could see airplanes coming, see tanks, see people running fields shooting us. war can’t see enemy. It’s surprise attack tools fight masks, properly worn masks, keeping hands clean.”

Khodadadi said fears getting exposed taking virus home young daughter autoimmune disease. said best stress release valve talking things front-line colleagues, nursing buddy recently particularly bad shift.

“I asked said, “Man, sat car cried today. thought wouldn’t end. like ‘Twilight Zone.’ ”

Puri described losing female COVID patient whose daughter, college student, distraught despite loss she’d experienced, friends taking basic precautions limit spread virus.

“A lot young folks don’t want wear masks. think forget get COVID like get car accident,” Puri said, likening face covering buckling seat belt.

Rao, also cystic fibrosis specialist, said shorter life expectancy people disease helps prepare patients families somewhat death. COVID-19, said, “hits like ton bricks.” Death come quickly, leaving loved ones shock.

“Sadly, it’s face every time. It’s face denial,” Rao said. “The face utter this-can’t-be-happening, blank look of, ‘I know you’re telling something, it’s registering.’ ”

For first three weeks pandemic, Rao stayed dorms Keck avoid taking exposure home family. avoiding work option.

“A part Hippocratic oath literally says go homes sick take care sick,” Rao said.

But national emergency hasn’t treated like one, said, gotten leadership crisis screams for. Rao told supports rights free choice, “there’s also social responsibility personal freedoms.”

When done talking, Rao walked hill went back work, lives balance around, heat summer surge didn’t happen.

steve.lopez@latimes.com 5 weeks two days off. Pulling 19 hour shift tonight. feel pain. Cuz far /s Sources? There’s different say there’s need wear mask (during lockdown), falsely presenting data economy open make give appearance normalcy lose election. Obviously. wanna demonize Fauci madman calling shots, go ahead. Yea, company executives Moderna dumping millions stock making big announcement social media, medical publication mind you, might peer reviewed, social media! mind that's pretty inexcusable. can't science social media expect people take seriously. Also, Moderna executives cash officially vaccine tells jack shit. know anyone root companies operate fashion.

If executive Moderna, know close vaccine, would sell stock company? Hello, think it!  Fucking parasites mention nursing home staff, admins janitors!

Keeping virus nursing homes would cut death toll half more, countries. Yeah SinoVac candidate also really promising - Phase III Brazil right now. Oxford's (if successful, crossing fingers hard can) would definitely first market though, given already safety data Phase I. IIRC Sinovac said year end/beginning 2021?  fair, correlation people antimask and/or believe virus hoax people think good idea go theme park right very, strong.

Probably people nursing cup water day without mask. city it? least county don’t see problem here, twisting history. Amusingly enough, add Medicare, Medicaid, VA spending together, US Federal government spends amount per citizen health care Britain, France Canada. Note, amount per person treated, amount per total population!

If NHS set shop US could pay level care Americans without raising taxes.

Likewise, could pay health care everyone Canadian model without additional funding. 

We inefficient spend twice much (or slightly worse) outcomes. Party private companies collect profits partially every person insurance ends still getting paid people insurance (hospitals can't refuse service), end costing us lot go ER lot sicker (aka much higher bill). think countries gotten covid control. us / UK, that's countries run populist nut jobs moment.  guess EU bureaucrats (and apparently lot them) need paid somehow... :p globalism

Don't unscientific approach rely mask vehicle stop spread virus.

But that's what's happening, states anywhere else world. Masks component strategies employed fight virus. Others include (but limited to) social distancing, specific guidelines businesses venues, keeping certain businesses closed financially secure, tracking tracing, shielding vulnerable creating infrastructure shelter place. Third top post sub moment. Made myself. mixed alcohol water. still buy alcohol think? mean, federal government already arresting protestors Portland unmarked vehicles, add anti-maskers list they're it?

Merely stating man’s sentence technically correct. That’s that’s all. He's likely already safe, unfortunately ""dead"" virus still causes positive tests

[ALL patients Singapore study non-infectious (though still testing positive) 11 days first literally already threads this. aren’t leaders anymore pathetic response. Sorry fellow Americans. Trump says sniffle 🙄 Ireland made compulsory public transport retail settings, addendum wear one ""have illness impairment would make wearing removing face covering upsetting uncomfortable"". naturally half people wearing them. big difference something physically happening if. Like 99% positive cases don’t even go hospital. passed doctors office last month claustrophobic made wear mask. I’ll happily stay home much possibly since already chance need leave home I’ll need someone time wear mask since I’m worried it’ll happen enforcing mask usage? Would police hand fines? Ahh can't wait get royally pissed fucking tory government takes credit Hey little perspective here. wear mask car I'm running store store I'm lazy take every two minutes. What's sort ironic seem bothered others wearing mask are. way Trump cronies get rich this, little chance it’ll reach US sooner January. Maybe another 4-1/2 years. Wait masks mandatory like 3 months germany 😂 literally felt like March year.  He's home right now, feel free leave message. yeah, states making mandatory, title read ""just like united states..."" till fall winter gets schools re-open.

Yeah, no. school districts CA opted distance learning, meaning schools remain closed possibly till first quarter next year. 

Not that, lot things LA closed again. Worst case scenario, everything lock again. think Federal Executive Branch mandate masks everywhere country. authorized Constitution. There's article says ""oh yeah, it's, like, *real important*, ignore document."" can’t help picture scene Silicone Valley work quickest efficient way jerk hundreds men once. Well spend 2 trillion waste all, yeah economy going real big hurt. /r/EntitledBitch material Well no, Hitler could speak complete sentences. people don’t want wear mask sake “freedom”, wear clothes? make law like wearing clothes mandatory public tried man, you’re stupid talk to. case would probably wearing mask. True, forget that. relative mine staffed Boston one really worried them, said always manageable level. orders 35 million doses British people.

I think assumption countries act unscrupulously get hands vaccine soon shown work, UK trying insulate likelihood shipments mysteriously going missing. also stupid guideline ""6 Feet Fine!""

It ""Stay away people. Stay home. MUST go somewhere, wear mask keep LEAST 6', would better.""

Instead reading ""nobody going anywhere emergent"", businesses saw ""6' everything else normal"". I'm 50 guy. Dating sucks days. Everybody wants perfect person. truth matter toss aside like cheap garbage, want anyway. 30, got ton good years left.

I’ve casual investor decade normally think idea pulse economy, anymore. Big money holding kind miracle. stock market usually irrational, forever. Every quarter two correction puts real picture back line. hasn’t happened since started. It’s like market chooses ignore reality. I’ve money since May there’s way continue. There’s zero chance many industries trouble people work stock market breaks records. it’s reasons...that I’m out... Hmm alright. Thanks clarification :)  able wear mask day PROPERLY without complaining? 
If wear properly, mask useful waving stick air. kids I've seen absolutely can't wear mask properly age; either big stop touching it/their face pull nose... start playing face. older kids issues... I'm sorry, absolutely believe friend's preschooler kindergartner wearing masks PROPERLY. skill kids age have, brain wired opposite developed enough able actually handle responsibility severely important. teach young children wear masks, absolutely cannot teach wear masks 100% properly time... takes 60 seconds exposure time catch transmit virus. masks, exposing children situations outside abilities control. know there's plenty people pro-vaxxers mask mandates ""liberties"". could also actually see people arms government starts mandating vaccines.
I think distrust...government vs doctors.


So see lots anti-maskers talk virus hoax, numbers add up, doctors lying, etc...but lots anti-maskers saying violating civil liberties, government blowing control us (with masks, guess), government able close businesses, etc. Again...lots potential overlap, think actually difference anti-mask....with result case, though, exactly matter end. never answered question. manipulated words get cheap insult in. 

So ill give another opportunity answer question. Pfft. Stop cheap. Here's REAL cookie. 🥨 reason Republicans fighting bars, restaurants, gyms open, reason Republicans fighting wearing mask.

If GOP convince people everything returned normal ahead November election, stand better country still midst control pandemic. 

The problem strategy pretending things normal not, pandemic grows less controlable.

If people wanted in-person schooling open fall, started preparing last spring, things like, wearing mask, keeping bars restaurants shut except take out, increase testing capacity, increase conact tracing ability, strictly enforcing social distancing.

had things done, could return hybrid model fall. things done. I'm talking capacity role government. correct word 'sociopath'. 'Kentucky reports 979 new COVID-19 cases'

So basically Kentucky ill... Yep. Human society specifically waited til year 2020 take away freedoms. Yer dum dums. ask dude, work imperial college london? see stanning ton Well, Kanye got ridiculous clothing line. So...one imagine. could see someone history sexually assaulted mouth covered (esp repeated assaults childhood).

That could definitely anxiety triggering, perhaps point can't it.

But that's case best stay home get assistance shopping try telehealth medical appointments. virus dangerous risk health for. one day, Trump disappear magic... Rwanda proud boys open carry outside director public health quit? order lol. Well know I’m essential worker , decide pay us like pay people staying home, might consider. Right it’s seems like I’m taking risk reward. See??? It’s fucking Trumppppp!!!!! He’s going kill us alllll  Yeah, whenever jabs school, kids would go home we'd really work rest day personally would take lockdown means workplace goes back 1 week shifts. 

But got full pay 50% worktime since ""standby"" home every second week.

This probably best time life.

We've never closer sometimes reminisce would like dealing one past shitty relationships. can't even put words bad feel people ""trapped"" (in every type way, own) bad relationships right now,


We're best friends. hobbies, luckily reading computers ect home. can't imagine dealing situation anything less no, sounds like pure anxiety misery. We've ordered 100m Oxford doses around 90m others. We'll likely get first developed produced  workplace protrunp. Foxnews plays day cafiteria. got hired long questionnaire asking terrorist planning one, im sorry apparently standing trumps idea wishing away plague fudging numbers makes one now, according fox.

Im sorry, corona, people say big deal never fucking it, did, lucky. math wrong understanding also wrong. Medicare pays 80% bill.  

The reason looks like great deal typical person pay Medicare 30-40 years without getting benefits.  benefits covered Medicare paid everyone else getting return. put everyone Medicare beneficiaries go up, cost goes up, there's magic act that's going disappear exorbitant medical costs. thought already talked this, much testing leads cases... /s great. 

But, anti-vaxer movement grown, especially since last months Russian Trolls spreading Bill Gates creating super tracking device guise vaccine control brains nonsense. Ah yes, pay live scheme that's strawman ok.  Dark age thinking. want fear monger wording seems indicate vaccine working well hoped. realize stupid unreasonable sounds? Hell lot states fire reason all.

""Oh, btw fired""

""why""

""Because said so""

End unionization. watched team speaking BBC backing away September statement, becoming difficult test due falling rates infection.

They hoping trials South Africa Brazil helpful proving prevent reduce infections.

Unfortunately lockdowns effective stopping spread negatively impacted ability test vaccine effectively. read whole comment chain dreamed 12 years, forcing come true. Nightmare reality.  Imperial College London wants distribute everywhere around world early next year, Sinovac believe actually ahead Oxford’s absolutely would this. study showed vaccine induced immune response SARS-CoV-2, specifically spike protein antigen surface. would affect susceptibility flu viruses, spike proteins instead hemagglutinin neuraminidase surface. fired ""cause"", would eligible unemployment? backlog unemployment claims, would even able get processed before, say, rent due? Naw, go work sick. usual expectation US. fact, glorified supposedly indicates dedication. really stupid regard US.

This one reasons keep telling people single payer healthcare want everyone covered. Even selfish care yourself, would want everyone working good health. affect family not. we're ignoring giant snake attack? call them, Million Dollar Immune system. Part Immune, Part System. Americans excepting cost 700% anywhere else world? people care Nobel prize? read edit specifically mentioned education response someone claiming college degree gave edge plague walkers.

You seem rather chemically imbalanced. mental capacity comprehend someone could intelligent also disagree you.

I mean worked masks belief masks little. kinda funny really, reality quite sad realize people minds warped much media consumption.

My recommendation would stop intake media news. clearly healthy effect. Yeah always look worldometers updates worrisome stopped reporting 1400 cases. Google isn’t helping either, news outlets doesn’t seem care all. hoping it’s Belgium don’t get news concerning countries. Also lizard people mole people crab people quite impressive make out- 16 year old vaccine SARS1. they've able race ahead like have, confirm offered protection *this* coronavirus, jump straight human trials. already animal testing. Still bloody amazing though. work SARS1 got shelved 'burnt' Good them. guy nuts. grocery store 10 packs surgical-style masks China, every time wore them, got AWFUL rash. Like, I’d go bed strongest steroid cream (triamcinolone 0.1%), still look rough next day. Still used them—hardly anyone seeing part face anyway eventually heal. cousin able get us cloth masks made local woman makes tons gives away anyone needs them. podcast? Sounds worth listen little good news nothing else. heard tests averaging week getting results back. tests number last week, then? *Senators Kelly Loffler Richard Burr typing* 99% point. phase 3 trials need 50% effectiveness CDC approve it. Hardly, since Christianity oficially recognized 4th century, like underground thing. moment put everyone Medicare magic disappears cost skyrockets.

Do really think people start going doctor willy nilly healthcare card says ""Medicare"" instead ""Aetna""? LOL ask things bad people want way life end. lost popular vote  Stock market equal happening real life. lot people, people hard time getting used wearing mask keeping distance people. know it’s every day thing we’ve years. though uneducated, incompetent moron president. Please don’t punish us Americans moron President United States America. greatest fear Europe England punish Government. us voted 4 bastard. Death part matters, huh?

I'm glad know exactly implications virus experts don't. probably contact revelation. Chris, make film willful ignorance socially-encouraged sociopathy, wait 2022 release. Georgia citizen here.

Current mood: shambles. testing capacity means they'll probably miss bunch cases since mild ones gonna like bother. 

So mild cases asymptomatic ones...just means cases know stupid shit like keep coming. US side? saw moderna test here. signed one. Good thing kids live alone don’t live parents and/or grand parents...  mention president seems understanding dangerous nukes fallout are, suggested nuking hurricane possible solution. dude also staffers looking building alligator filled moat across southern border. Yep, he's things like closing tube rental places river, allowing people bring tubes Highly skeptical doubt it. Spanish flu second wave (the deadliest) started August 1918 300k people dying US September December. comparison around 26k deaths period 1915. January 1919 kicked third wave 12k deaths January June so. bad feeling we're going get clobbered even worse weather starts shift I've noticed LOT age group well.

People 27-38 (just I've seen) seem take seriously, people 40 (here least) seem like can't bothered might happen, wear mask. Thats scary part, healthy people (No known underlying conditions) die.

&amp;#x200B;

But really want look sides, must see ongoing war Virus Biological life since probably beginning, simply natural selection. 

&amp;#x200B;

Humanity tried move past natural selection, hell even natural fear responses giant fucking bears anymore. well known idiot- earth would anyone actually listen him? Clearly anyone idiot themselves.

Again no. Take example, countries East Asia gets translated, watered version President says. news filters dumb/incoherent parts out. Russia meddling, Trump gov'ts' incompetence, etc common knowledge outside America. countries' average citizens hear internal affairs local news, much hear theirs.

I'm trying put perspective someone outside America would views (circle back OP call ethnocentric) Americans whole.

A direct approach limit airborne viral transmissions inactivate within short time production. Germicidal ultraviolet light, typically 254 nm, effective context but, used directly, health hazard skin eyes. contrast, far-UVC light (207–222 nm) efficiently kills pathogens potentially without harm exposed human tissues. previously demonstrated 222-nm far-UVC light efficiently kills airborne influenza virus extend studies explore far-UVC efficacy airborne human coronaviruses alpha HCoV-229E beta HCoV-OC43. Low doses 1.7 1.2 mJ/cm2 inactivated 99.9% aerosolized coronavirus 229E OC43, respectively. human coronaviruses similar genomic sizes, far-UVC light would expected show similar inactivation efficiency human coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2.

That's fucking infuriating. teaching one flexible things remotely. pushing bad without cause. doesn’t make sense it’s fault tourist came thousands spread thing stuff open didn’t mean people come partake it, people live actually trying quarantine it’s unsuccessful people NY NJ etc come act ridiculous appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* ""what permanent damage"" pretty important point. Polio asymptomatic/mild almost cases hardly ever fatal, look long-term damage survivors.

Obviously, lower fatality rate expected good news, though! Damn... waiting false negative come close way find specific case fatality rate age, sex, height, weight? (31, M, 5""9, 210lbs)

I've problem weight long time, unfortunately I've put weight quarantine I'm back obese. also family history heart disease, although problems yet.

I've heard multiple stories \~30 year old people dying COVID-19, age weight me. would like get better understanding specific case fatality rate know need take seriously. Thanks!

My wife required go back in-person classes university, live together. Malaysia bad, think matter time someone brings university, catch her. I'm nervous would like better understanding statistics probabilities. example, there's 50% chance I'll catch it, 25% chance I'll die it, I'll get go somewhere safer. least live different apartment. much. Wait really starts hurt, unfortunately.  heres danger. spend unlimitted money long perceived safest bet. however much eventually people lose confidence currency value money declines precipitously. historically happened every country history holds world reserve currency status acting irresponsible ( since 1980) eventually catches you. cycle repeated fiat currencies since roman empire. accellerating irresponsible spending since 2008 prop stock market corona accellerated even more. Kids people definitely live alone bring families!

The mayor Atlanta husband got sick asymptomatic child. mild case bit worse. think idea theres afford live alone minimum wage. Insulating houses big bills. dont know oxford trials states, 20-30 us companies looking volunteers right now! cannot stop thinking must several guys China, working government who's job read US news.

I want know feel amused depressed. Maybe both? hear russian well. hope shitshow end August September  first effective treatment already came Oxford University weeks ago, too.

Well, study (looking data across 175 hospitals), already widely available drug (and type treatment already known, study proving particular drugs effectiveness particular illness) read Lancet article came today. honestly amazing 'light end tunnel' feeling world I'm lucky enough Aberdeen, Scotland Scotland cases way England response much better we're away central belt much less densely populated city.

Yet I'm still seeing 90% respecting social distancing wearing masks, actually feel safe great remember 4th July? People held parties fireworks shows like normal. Even pandemic holidays celebrated. Also don’t see wouldn’t tree lights. first time ever, received notice may jury duty potentially Sept. 1 - Dec 31st. beside - actual, clinical OCD thought sitting courtroom pandemic really freaked out. would me?  Highest Monday fatality total record even close. could ugly week Florida.

Every Monday 40 less (most days 20 days April went 30). Nobody chain arguing state's ability enforce mask-usage. 20 states mask requirement.

The discussion federal mandate. Yes, connected Reddit servers. Maybe try Facebook, clearly know first thing reddiquette. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Apparently 30, makes feel lot better. 2 cases 6 weeks province million people. One Americans travelling ignoring Canadian rules. 

Voluntary Mask use up, social distancing still thing, businesses make mandatory masks, small amount people openly unhappy they’re ignored. going go home they’re going get it. 
 
They're going go home spread parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles. lol gives 1981 film Escape New York vibes. 1918? dumb dumbs can't even remember 2016, made dumbass choice. 2000, made another dumbass choice. basketball feel like I'm turning crazy person here. crazy alternate reality live put blinders on

it's really happened. I've calling Americans.

(Sorry, know lot give shit actually care :) ) probability success this? see lot good news always disclaimer certainty uncertainty. looking rough estimate much get hopes up. 25%? 50%? 75%? No, no, testing, confirmed cases. need stop testing won’t show cases. Yeah, guys claim they're ""too big"" use condoms. deductible Can’t wait anti vaxxers anti maskers find something shit one lol two great universities. Oxford's complete dump! people true anymore. family got tested it’s week still waiting. Different member went today told week wait minimum first time changed mine myself, ended falling highway raining. fact say 'experimental vaccine' good thing? 
Is actually vaccine? I'm confused. comments say already it? manufacturing? 
Should putting experimental things every American? lead deaths Covid? wanted meet maker much sooner anticipated. Kimchi. There’s cabbage kimchi. there’s cucumber kimchi. Plus it’s natural probiotics. Question someone knows better; far data suggesting limited durability antibody response natural COVID exposure. 

Would possible vaccine others? point state right still experiencing spikes. think experiencing spikes everything shut three months think took toll people. small things start opening back people overdid wound screwing everybody. think actually quarantine shorter period time went level social distancing Sooner people would’ve handled better. Christ long stretch fun thing allowed walk around, course people snapped. course doesn’t help didn’t nationwide quarantine time, incredibly stupid. initial comment wanls nothing sad attempt grab free karma. hard read thread jump last minute popular consensus  inflate ego shame got fall back disrespectful polite Phase 1 completed peer reviewed phase 2 data peer reviewed entering stage 3 many countries including 30k right America  worse still, shrink hands turn skin orange. Trump loses(or dies) may Step right direction. Nothing perfect people able wear masks social distance bars obvious reasons. Let's learn southern explosion, clearly learn Italy, NY, us.

Unfortunately restaurants also problem, consequences closing indoor dining *again* would extremely painful. 

As virus spreads, probably take action eventually. Especially schools open, everyone starts bring little birthday parties indoors, community spread starts get control.  make minimum wage, scraping $30 flu vaccine puts work. Way miss anything saying. even damn masks mandatory not, lamenting Swedish OP saying US better Europe clearly country cases terrible response.

You can't shutdown state borders, federal government could reacted like did, Trump could've endorsed masks quit downplaying virus. Hypothetically. EU also shitty job terms coordinated response, US would upper hand theoretically.

Although guess could've talking mask compliance specifically. honestly regret commenting, coming sub well. Gonna unsub. year old

Lol. Projecting much? way federal government addresses protests kids cages reminiscent 4TH reich. EU?? enforce masks times like these? C'mon now. wanna believe Americans, people like make hard. Specifically sweden even lockdown. company announced last week work home rest year . thankful built strawman hijack said purposes.

All make true statement government powers. 

I'm favor governments temporarily curbing freedoms fight pandemic. 

The courts hear cases case case basis. companies suing closed. prior pandemic known infectious person forced leave home armed guards prevent spreading disease. courts approved I.

There 1st amendment limitation agree with. baffling recognize limitations ability large gatherings good thing temporary abrogation normal rights.

&amp;#x200B;

The point trying make twofold

1) quite like copyright law well defined test, parameters precedents. bad specific public health crisis defines power state help prevent it. feel state unreasonable, sue them. That's check executive branch case.

2) virus bad gives state right stuff. example 100% contagious 100% chance death virus like something ""the crazies"". virus much worse, state much power. Coronavirus global tragedy affected every country, almost every person planet negative way. fact celebrate people dying use attempt boost ego tells lot are. like Trump never American mean support him. I've taking precautions millions Americans. Without getting deep psychology here, Chinese agent seem deep personal issues resolved celebrating another country's deaths. case apologize calling Chinese agent, Chinese influence platform real given post history completely rational think that's would be. places daily cases already virus burn population

Cite source. seen estimates recovered 10%` maybe aware something newer?

Herd immunity kicks lower 67%.  topic but, Man Denmark op. competitive games follow Denmark good. Yah that’s really interesting tho, well least guys well regards covid bright side? Even it’s weird? xD Masks required state now, unless can't medically tolerated. 

The person saw without mask grocery old man motorized wheelchair using oxygen tank, which, cool, seems legit. also, fuck would go crowded grocery store clearly already lung issues instead free curbside pickup? seems like he'd *most* risk contracting it. Sky UK CNN, ESPN, Showtime USA, except owed company. Sky premium cable UK basically. Going philosophy, literally game implemented. everyone pointed before, it’s kids, every living, healthy adult. guy gets wish schools open up, everyone catch coronavirus. comfortable gambling elderly friends relatives lives, means, support man think like him. Hard believe men power. people voted think relate. Temporarily embarrassed millionaires that. Interesting tested 18-55 age group. include people outside age range Phase III?

Great news nonetheless. Americans can't point countries map, overestimate educational levels.

Remember pompeo challenging foreign desk reporter Ukraine lol? Pompeo expects able to, shows geographically unaware people hangs usually are.  needs national holiday mourning remembrance thanks. Maybe week.   Americans don’t either... Um, 50% effective vaccine would never pass type study even presented public option. 50% basically means 1 2 people get exposed get virus. Given people naturally relax getting vaccine almost guarantees community spread. need 90% even worthwhile.

Or, arguing people vaccination continue social distance, wear masks, etc. Okay, good luck that. vaccination meant return people normal life. argument need still social distance means return fully kids classroom, sports played living life vaccine sort pointless. vaccine going cut it. would also sued wazoo. sometimes, look SARS (this SARS-cov-2) infected survived still immunity 17 years later. 10 percent morons US has...probably 10 percent US population Using logic, germans good nothing nazis Everyone country currently ordering every vaccine pipeline... can't wait proven start manufacturing gotta get waiting ready choose one. Goes show truly incompetent Trump is. 

He clearly stated virus would gone summer months, due heat. 

Now proven horribly wrong, stopping CDC reporting infections. 

Next up, outlaw news reporting virus. 

Why? 

Because know doing. And, suffer, want admit clueless, useless utterly worthless. exactly subtle hinting types explaining vaccine is. passed phase 2. Phase 3 underway month. no. BLM protests spread virus. wrong it’s sad - mmr vaccine 93 98 efficacy second dose. vaccine real deal peer reviewed top experts thorough study despite claim.
If dispute what’s field lab university hospital work for? curious know peer would doubt peer reviewed paper ??? It’s like praising D- cause half nation stupid F r/evenwithcontext Call us back old enough serve, Chachi. Till then...shhhhhhhh. schools closed parents aren’t working Trump others can’t claim economy running along full speed. ""Oxford vaccine proven safe effective mass production"" something make snow angles joke, hyperbole absurdity somewhat grim name vaccine development times like this, several government heads, officials press releases accidentally called instead warp speed, silly. manufactured distributed Oxford predominately American pharmaceutical companies manufacture, price distribute every vaccine America? Yes? That's best effort convincing people?  Considering comment’s downvoted daring say vaccine position irrelevant question... id agree. Good. needs uplifting news here. first half scenario people tested batches 4 positive test rate individuals 25% would expect positive rate almost 70% batches. too. Pool testing already late USA daily cases 70k. similar flu way transmitted? sure course. flu, no. comparing flu terms transmission style we're page, comparing flu regards severity well (which assumed) that's different. Pls correct I'm.wrong  liberty infect others?

By dumb logic want allowed drink drive too. doubt manufacturing process. AZ pump metric shit ton vaccinations ready hit market moment's notice. debate. highly doubting happen end year, every article researchers saying vaccines available  year goes well. take issue story twisted way sends message getting vaccinated two months. Hey, make great story though.

Here copy-pasted another one replies. Oh agree risks in-person school reopenings. point people thread frankly giving kids enough credit even young children - extent - taught safe behaviors. Cough, Convulse, Croak job! That's awesome incredibly lucky remain employed pandemic

As people unemployment, matter money got? runs week they'll nothing,wheras still employed.

I get upset about, job continue job, incredibly lucky That’s certainly hypothesis Right-Walkers, winter coming. Yup. Complete opposite situation Seattle, least part it. sat ass home playing Kingdom Come: Deliverance whole time. Still, good day. 'dream spring' real life. Hm. No, dear.

We want go away. first priority logical; protect people protecting us (healthcare workers, scientists), risk (elderly, people poor health)... trickle line.

Until then, stay safe. point. Texas live, masks mandatory. lot concern schools opening back tell (anecdotally) kind concern around daycares open month US (maybe even more). coworkers children home shoes daycare shoes, temperatures scanned parents allowed within facility.

Why precautions work school setting? volume children potential cross contamination across classrooms grades? would think telling 1st grader wear mask times would much easier instructing preschooler to. 

Or individuals feel administrators / governments plan opening schools hail mary show everything 'fine'? Trump’s re-election party falling line. Shutdowns, mask mandates etc. put fear economy loses votes Trump. Trump weekly calls governors telling he’ll cut funding, cut party support, etc. unless back him. Instead spine, fall line get people killed. attempt recipe, substituted entire thing chocolate chip cookies instead. great, five stars Oh, exactly how:not all. comfort, practically everyone gluten intolerant levels taken days. got tetanus renewal shot last year. hurt arm 2 days injection site.

There's probably many factors coming together drive viral proliferation hardiness. Also maybe lot people hoping apply viral patterns one, still unknown we've full year experiencing seasons do. reality course varies person don’t think people getting serum IgG checked daily quantifiable increase day 10 day 28 (I hope I’m getting numbers right without referencing procedure study) could well happened sooner... yeah 28 days ominous lol Nope, doesn't. Nice leave backdoor open insert conversation piss moan capitalism. Also good look call someone dumb can't use proper capitalization consistently formulate actual sentences. Enjoy job Subway fighting man. worth time. fact comment even downvoted says really. Aka fragile stop living life.

Was said. Show article says that. correcting context got article quote article. wrong really sad point. Seek help, moron. Hello mudda, hello fadda,
Here at, camp Granada place near specialized beer. pickles corn chips menu, said reccommend eat them, get pizza next door bring in. talking paradox tolerance. talking idea idiotic literally hurting make sure hurt too.

Vaccines never 100% effective. work give many people possibly can, slowing virus *every* potential infection point. get vaccine surrounded people didn’t, still good chance getting sick. feel even remotely sorry, situation sounds extremely stressful need let emotions out. need vent feel free hit inbox. US refuses allow us order one charges us thousands comes 2021.

Seriously, please don't. Florida patients also shipped state, I've told. Brb buying stock Doritos I’ll looking DIY Animal Crossing Okay, I'm US, feel like rest world thinks entire country covid-19 bath floating air something. bad here, that's tiny bit unrealistic.

If stay truck 97 percent time, bring food, risk contracting covid-19 pretty low, unless maybe hot spot. riskiest areas would restrooms, interact people. understand logic, spikes could controlled deaths revive.

And Sweden harvesting finished many thoughts. dreadful, hope someone miss golden opportunity make parody tourism commercial video. Sometimes humor raise awareness done right. Astra Zeneca secured license produce US back May, sure anything changed since though. pipe dream possible?  Massively negative events usually result positive advancements, one needs look WWII that.  Pangolin maybe? find continually surprised simultaneously humanity's ability humanity's stupidity. really incredible ways! wouldn’t rude you, unfortunately utilitarian perspective anti mask assholes probably first people want vaccine since they’re way likely spread disease others wear masks. much would love people face consequences actions, I’d personally rather see disease gone that.

Although HavocReigns said, people refuse wear masks also probably people likely refuse vaccines anyway, hey way you’ll probably get wish.  COVID coming election make Canada excellent choice. /s Great grandparents moved England Ireland. Would also like know. worldwithoutcovid.org nonprofit match clinical trials like these. actively looking people! [profiting last time checked. one guy kite. 

You mean guy helped draft Declaration Independence 1776 also negotiated 1783 Treaty Paris ended Revolutionary War?

“There never good war bad peace.”  1. Preheat non-stick bioreactor 425 degrees.
2. Ferment Chinese hamster ovarian cells 89 hours, slightly browned. US manufacturing 300 million, think need ship us. gave AstraZeneca $1.2 billion May prepare start manufacturing October timeline start delivery thanks! knew  There's going lot brain drain pandemic subsides.

People taking less risky careers, retiring early, need go public disability long term, die.

So there's going job openings paired incentives.

If live, household leaving country. We're thinking New Zealand. Huh.

The article linked showed 43 full July 7. sure, everyone else generalizing entire population based actions select few. anti-vaxxers already full force sadly. We'll gag mask vaccine cannot administered approved. certainly shipped prior approval. Bleach?  **IF** works, least months September people start getting vaccinated regularity, yes, schools delayed November-January earliest. produced US, AstraZeneca license. result though, take teeth export ban. athletes crippled virus. fun games get body muscle start creating viral proteins create immunity oops - trigger allergic response. *great* news, home run. Untill survive LMFAO! I'm talking exactly said. account made two *posts*. Posts comments different things. Wipers designed come sufficiently pissed fuck try snap off...then comes easily. Heh, test subject pneumonia vaccine !  level high-level coordination simply exist US. way control healthcare US cost, want give rich people first THAT. simply ""needs-based"" acuity based healthcare infrastructure US. Man, Massachusetts made masks mandatory! Monday made magnificent mask. Making masks mark mindful motion, monumentally! I've never heard website, know 100% (and trust random Google'ing). know could expect signed volunteer here? Gotta love completely ignored said.

If wear mask improperly, useful waving stick wind. Young children literally brain development needed handle severely important responsibility. Proper mask wearing means touching mask, pulling nose, nothing like that. seen single young child capable this.

&amp;#x200B;

Second: Pandemics indeed happen, trying equate normal every day life incredibly intellectually dishonest. last years (save instances) exacerbated improper quarantining. Normal every day danger ""normal nature"", know already.

&amp;#x200B;

I would indeed say crashes caused improper vehicle useage someone involved, apply drunk driving good percentage it; literally illegal controlled. That's prosecuted cause wreck someone dies even drinking, actually legally allow operate vehicle manner choose. Injury kitchen far higher car crash fatalities, I'd like know actual point is? Normal day day activities carry inherent risks; Covid entirely preventable one, one necessary vast majority people exposed day day, require using children literal guinea pigs ""let's see happens because, well, life happens!"" experiment. like buying bottled water resell later tell everyone there's danger overflowing dam rupturing actually ruptures. help. problem shortage physical beds put patients in. build field hospital 3000 beds week, way manufacture 1500 ICU nurses staff would hope Trump longer office. people pushing open schools care look dear leader. long term effects Democrats problem take office blame everything get re-elected saying entitled 800 week never made much working career? Fuck  turn everyone weebs AYAYA Believe not, anti-maskers medicine well.

Stupid reached new low. located? you’re anywhere near Montreal I’ll happy help. 

Also, kind vehicle have?

Ps sometimes press tab instead up. I'm virologist, would talking all? mentally challenged?

I cited one leading virologists coronaviruses world past 17 years. probably knows do, anyone else whole platform. 

How dense stupid? Holy crap, embarrassing. prefer listening experts talking ass, unlike you. :-)

Here, another nice one mutations! 

Really cool one knowledgable people whole planet explain you, daily beginning. give try! made genetically engineered virus causes common cold heavily modified, first cannot cause infections people also make ""look"" like coronavirus.

I know things cant help reads like plot zombie movie. biggest mistake. rich parents. Thank you! respectfully disagree. priorities. one coffee starbucks, eaten one meal restaurant, paid food delivered house, smart phone, made choice spend money.  

I peripherally exposure consumer spending data professional friends. Discretionary spending huge number.  want use avocado toast argument, say impossible false. simply fit lifestyles. 

When say practical, mean practical lifestyle have. Went looking comment :) hate fact probably gonna true ¡estúpidos! article commenting large trial involving **30,000 people US** well 2,000 South Africa 5,000 Brazil.

Hard imagine they'd able large scale trial US deny US vaccine turns effective.   Then, fair, I'll say electronic devices incredibly important. day, something learned separately main subjects. never used calculators except check work ""you use calculators job/college/high school"". Got bit High School well. College, window.

A *massive* number careers need computer science classes everybody uses computers one thing another. learning opportunities bleeding edge tech like Virtual Reality glasses transport people back time important dates history, virtual tourism different ways make impact.

Though strictly necessary something like Social Studies, curriculum developed teachers many years. government comes last minute says ""Make outside ready month"" they're going screwed.

But honestly, beside point far many places simply weather facilities would work. explaining futility idea behind 2nd amendment. armed rebellion, military tactics standpoint, would fact go well side posession bombs armor. Bad PR maybe, nobody wins fight US military, even Americans. circle back, 2nd ammendment useless antiquated piece law idea behind it, armed revolution, longer feasible. American Way! great depression happening again. good track line thinking count it. Masks cheap, real popular there. Rushing vaccines get Legend Yup.

There's reason public schools teach civic duty terms voting arson.

Rioting far effective voting would want effective resistance? Possibly future President Kanye. felt scary typing it. We've heading disaster while, COVID sped things up.

Aside massive, unsustainable personal debts American citizens, US different individual opening new credit card pay interest prior credit card debt (except US can't make magically go away declaring bankruptcy future).

These pre-COVID numbers, printed 7+ trillion thereafter.

**In 5 years interest national debt surpass entire defense budget**

21 years Medicare spending

24 years Social Security spending

29 years discretionary spending

Forget climate change, issue. Massive immediate cuts many programs way stop (or maybe significant wealth tax along measures). exactly opposite politician going tell retirees Social Security Medicare needs cut. people instead pushing UBI... US broke I'm thinking getting out.  almost :) think OP Newsweak ain't got learnin' 'bout satistics. article linked says 54 full July 7. Obviously kind cover-up public dismissal ruse increase revenues, encouraging constituents careless? what? Swedish speakers allowed comment articles Swedish press? You’re oversimplifying extremely complex issue. issue black white.  really. Every study design slightly different depending drug. generalities. 

Preclinical describes range animal tests drug goes through. Usually starting rodents finishing primates.

Phase 1 first time human cohort used. safety study generally recruits healthy men test likely survive goes wrong. successful output approval test further.

Phase 2 usually efficacy, drug work? Smallish cohort, usually compared placebo. Tested people disease (doesn’t apply vaccines course). Often checks dose. expanded cohort drug used children older people. Safety testing normally monitored well contribute overall picture. End measurement symptom biological response. 

Phase 3 also efficacy also compare current treatments. may work, better already have? Much larger numbers people broad cohort. Safety monitored again. Obviously COVID aren’t interested comparing already (nothing) need large numbers get confidence data set aren’t part phase 2.

This usually end point approval.

Phase 4. Post launch studies. Often safety related especially medicines orphan drugs (the treatment available). trials requirement registrations. Ignoring plight workers moment, companies deserve fail. taken 16 days counting get results Virginia. even self quarantining I'm starting show symptoms. would mean exposed initial exposure means another test go back work. Luckily given 2 weeks pay Covid doubt I'll get another 2. Everything handling situation awful. Hopefully everyone stays safe. Arizona's reporting assumed non-informative six figure test backlogs. Anxiety rational. rationally say getting blood drawn fine dangerous still panic attack last time (kept mask tho!) can’t wear mask due anxiety can’t go indoor public areas safely. *be company

*have little money left

*have stay open close down

*employee gets sick

*employee sues

*spend little remains lawyer fees

*lose

*have shut business lay employees

*laid employees get mad business Like Rand Paul? live Tucson anecdotally I’ve felt Arizonans better wearing masks since cities started institute mask mandates three half weeks ago. Also became national news bad getting Arizona I’m sure helped well. That’s say still aren’t “freedumb” people definitely think people wearing masks four weeks ago. Seriously - headlines particular crazy.

I'm super liberal friends keep posting articles headlines annoying actually read content look actual data. 
I mean here, even Oklahoma ""spiking!!"" really cases/deaths grand scheme things. countries around world parents panicking school government lifted finger help address problem.

In US, schools shut federal government (and many cases state county governments) done close enough. Every time raise question hear response oh can't work way government designed xyz. cop cessation agency. virus care principles government, cares replicating itself. goverment provides impediment suppression elimination, response growth virus. simple.

It's time people start holding governments accountable unprecedented disruption, loss education, loss revenue, importantly loss wellbeing life. criminally negligent screw populace like this. Best news heard while... it? 

The tears rest us peasants? it? Also username giveaway. heck large shopping mall parking lots might work.
The biggest one working paperwork transfer setting up
with expeditors respirators walking around sanitizing spray fine. Keep canadians across border let go home fast. long break quarantine fine. dip fall nowhere near thing LMAO RIP. Young people getting virus definitely ""heal day"" ""have sniffles"". I'm favor closing schools..but right argument ""without cause"".

Teaching young children like work-from-home. barely possible, childrens' educations suffering. 

Many kids temprament focus outside controlled environment classroom. Many educational materials available paper books. teacher can't effectively distribute attention 25 kids Zoom class way could walking around classroom, educational apps (what kids orbit faced with) pale comparison real teacher putting effort make things interesting, assuming even hold kid's attention long enough get session.

This ignoring fact schools far away largest provider child care, without child care, many families plunged vulnerable situation. 

Shutting schools hideously costly, parents, children, economy. bad necessary right now. vaccine good wish take it.. know place paying 35/hr new hires I'm ears. not, I'll waiting industry allowed back. people power made impossible work things reopen, make sure survive then. Clean mess, speak. 62000 tests backlog know cases falling? Jeff Bezos actually trying get distribution, think. Remember ""take seat"" statement? women would actively choose put unborn child risk like this.  9 times 10, man pushing it.  like mothers cry daycare.  shitty fathers thrilled dumping kids stranger raise pimp wives workforce.   disgusting behavior detrimental women children needs change. Check NYSE FEC billionaires fine. That's American dream (of someone else) O'Rielly's parking lot it'll faster. They're going get efficacy data Brazil trial launches US. promise it. They're talking August timeframe US trial, that's well Moderna Pfizer going.  Yeah sounds like guy doesn’t understand sports Victoria left Vancouver. Unless you’re coming north leave Geordies this! due Corona virus it.. think got it?

&amp;#x200B;

/S !!! wisdom experience people get divorce unless someone sexual intercourse someone else.

Umm, WTF?

ok, leaving conversation strange. beginning end something, sure. 
 
The what, dont know. sure beginning end COVID19 sure.  here's thinking good news coming UK lot vaccines cause tyoes symptoms, fever headaches caused immune system fighting pathogens must missed that...but good. Thanks, friend!  lift arm fully upright next time bro got this.

Mistakes bad long term learn them.

Maybe stupid thing encourage someone believe believe new windshield. They're asking gatherings, they'll get info. Ja, natürlich? Warum sollte ich denn sonst einen deutschen Podcast posten? 

Was bist du denn bitte für ein Genie? Im September gibt der gute Drosten auch weiter Podcasts. Derzeit wurde er leider ersetzt und es gibt nur wöchentliche. Phase 3 underway. 75 yard hail mary us goal line 500% increase deaths pneumonia far year Florida. Phase 3 underway. 75 yard hail mary us goal line Yeah lot easier distance houses block apart 7 people live state hour drive town go store. Remember Trump’s company required hospitals report numbers instead CDC? Everywhere going see cases fall. suppressed lol, don’t trust data see covid going forward. We’re still beginning this. anything, less people wearing masks cases rising rapidly. believe referring millennium Oxford already existed, future. eli5 version cdc getting covid info? accurately reported now? this.  No, earlier trials safety case vaccine (or another factor finished product) causes adverse effects. would still needed want make sure vaccine terrible effect predicted theoretically give millions people. happens fund science!!! Seems good amount misinformation timeline. indication Oxford/Astrazeneca doses vaccine ready public September/October. Best case timeline December/January that. Need manage expectations this. section Brazilian website talking rollout there. 

When vaccine ready? 

If effectiveness least 70%, even tests still progress, part vaccine registration package done end year. Oxford's idea set dossier registrations vaccine, presented UK regulatory authorities December. would get first worldwide record vaccine start vaccinating there, emergency basis. countries, like Brazil, would also enter records emergency basis and, bought vaccine, would start vaccinating. 

You need translate text link English Portuguese.

 Good, stay home king. assume refer snacilbupeR party. Snacilbupers problem years. name even sounds weird... Snacilbupers. dude's point, like CDC mascot coming house. one know fuck are. 

It'll representatives. CDC smart, they'd include locals going door door.

Otherwise, people really suspicious rando asking sample. Even rando CDC.

Lastly, there's always risk fraud scams erode trust participation.

/ Source - created vaccine program region increased childhood vaccination rates participation absolutely requires public trust. What's going Arizona? possible they've hit kind peak? 

I saw [this another sub, AZ among handful states hit R value 1. percent positive rate still seems high, tell dropping since 9th. 

Any thoughts welcome here. hate country  approve vaccine wait least year see side effects people right? least would feel comfortable injecting something pass right exams reason specifically? people severely ill. mean one severely ill. Severely ill people would die home. might also die hospital, least hospital chance. 

People found dead home big piece deaths due covid. 

So pretending like people would fine stayed home avoided doctors really quite stupid. Posting hundreds threads single country make people ask questions possible agenda.

Pointing harassment abuse. bias relevant discussion since multiple occasions mistranslated misrepresented swedish articles. important people read threads know translations arent always correct taken grain salt. course is.

It depends want distribute it.

The US governments handed trillions hand trillions over. results ownership stake money spent. not, disappear ether much 2008/2009 recovery did. post literally starts ""November 2020""

maybe call people dumb can't read yourself?? SALE: 1 American kidney, 1 American arm, 1 American leg, 1 American lung I'm glad they're elderly. Would strange young still married 61 years. nothing wrong. I'm posting publicly available information media's trusted source covid19 Yeah, seems like confusing move Americans. September-January. good ending near study sponsored cabbage &amp; cucumber coalition farmers  Hitler better Trump according you? worse? Yep. know it’s super easy get caught fighting fellow citizens, that’s they’re hoping for. need band together fight actual enemy. Literally nothing article says protesters there. getting posted subreddit? purposal. sent people US, give sane normal/smart ones visa Canada. speak German? Yes, government gonna inject tracking device power supply body. Meanwhile, warned danger people researching typing already existing tracking device easiest read article ive found- 

It sounds like manufacturing quite bit easier (which would mean mass producing would easier well) issue transporting vaccine right conditions.   like us vaccine needs 2 intentions, one month apart? would illegal Biden make deals promises behalf US assuming office. 

So, please consider US’s November election referendum whether place order 400 million doses January. Thanks. I'm always grateful posters like help like that. mean...this time crummy fluff piece, matters, too. That's really helpful. ""People tested positive COVID-19 transferred [New hospitals staffing shortages lack bed space, federal law requires hospitals accept patients neighboring states beds available.

We've seen large number places sort burnout (e.g. Sweden/UK). think places locked particularly hard longer (if ever did) hard attribute tiny case counts sort restrictions. (If so, we'll see huge surge finally roll back wrong one, guess)

The fixed herd immunity concept vaccinations, assume completely identical risk across perfectly mixed population. There's fairly unbiased discussion Pla-ce-bo, is, course, funny-sounding word. Eeek- thanks tip. kept thinking look bad I'm interested see info. already working pandemic got little lucky.  Still disinfectant near me, real hand soap isnt natural organic plant based. I’m going argue you, read article. They’re planning draw trial subjects US virus running rampant. It’s what’s best data. rules paying much studies doesn’t become coercive. typically compensate time trouble going appointments. minor kinda vaccine study 90’s took two visits involved shot nasal lavage. think paid around $80. actually surprised. comes Rwanda, people West still stuck thinking 1994 genocide. many people know Rwanda completely recovered, one best performing countries Africa. population doubled since 1994, yet, country experiencing consistently high GDP growth (7% more). burgeoning technology sector, manufacturing smartphones (!!) also take look streets capital Kigali, also YouTube videos African vloggers film ground. clean city tidy streets (supposedly one hygienic Africa). expected country larger population China 1/3 land mass? ever see pictures trains transportation? Packed like sardines. Plus drink sewage water major cities. Neither. bankruptcy can't tell many times past coworkers gotten sick kids spread around office. mean, normally, kind laugh like ahh well that's life. pandemic think experiences would make people cautious skeptical. Hot potato 🥔 I'm really tired seeing lists cases, deaths, hospitalization without adjusting population.

""Wow, Wyoming great!"" 43 fucking percent? Ok. it? Come on. Name yourselves. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* that's unfortunate given US behaving.

In way? clinical trials something Trump get get fingers into. far things he's able touch deciding gets funding via Operation Warp Speed, Pfizer making clear, that's really stopping anyone. Fauci's sitting Trump Moderna trial example, wants impact trial meaningful way, he's going find way actually fire Fauci. That's get uneasy: Trump fires Fauci installs puppet charge NIAID, maybe raise eyebrows, clinical trial way NIAID picked Institutional Review Board, Investigators, there's whole lot people would privy nefarious doings.

Trust data science, politicians. Oxford's gonna beat Moderna punch anyways. pull Nobel prize worthy Yeah, wife's job cut 2 days week. always wanted writer I've encouraging use extra 3 days pursue it.

Took awhile get depressed situation, started taking advantage past couple months. fact recently challenged write 10,000 words 24 hours pulled :).

Story might bit different struggling financially, I'm still working full-time (for now, least), bad. People getting checks federal government. intellectual exercise, please tell us he's improving anything virus, we're worst world. can't, he's fucking appalling. actual motives irrelevant, ACTIONS dramatically increasing death toll imbecile. Houston pretty dumb think right here. Please head local Corona ward video prove everyone wrong! national hero trump likely give medal. prove crap going licking guy ventilator. I'm pretty sure Operation Warp Speed gave AstraZeneca BILLION DOLLARS. Moderna. issue current co-director Coronavirus task force big Moderna shareholder.

The conspiracist feels story put speculation purely give Moderna shorts tomorrow. * stage one say nothing going happen.  
* Stage two, say something may happen, nothing it.  
* stage three, say maybe something it, there's nothing *can* do.  
* Stage four, say maybe something could done, late now. 
-- *Yes, Minister* And? mean, give 1.2 billion oxford, ordered 300 million vaccines them. Especially given pandemics history way worse. Spanish Flu way, way worse COVID-19 bubonic plague makes spanish flu look like COVID-19 comparison. yet still recovered plagues. recovered bubonic plague without modern medicine all. sorry suck Sure. I'm worried most, need offer shit load money ate even 1. lot wearing masks. Problem many think it’s ok ignore social distancing wearing one. company going mass producing it? free? Here’s latest Alabama. Gov. Ivey put mask mandate place enforcement spotty best. entitled opinion. distancing likely practiced.

I wouldn’t call practiced follows people social distance places like grocery passing contact

I’m sure would call 30 minutes next someone passing contact. Oh, thought UK. US, I'd probably add six months guess, size logistics involved many state governments, *know* USA botch rollout badly several ways thirty different crooks profiteer somehow. that's independent who's President January. I’m genuinely concerned going difficulty reaching heard immunity levels many parts US due anti-vaxers conservative fear based propaganda news machine. Right Tennessean... dumbfounding many people prefer social media conspiracies bad political leadership guidance given healthcare experts.

Sadly, affect personally believe it’s real. Dude, time shut go stroll naked outside long entire state infected rate? I'm saying anything anti vaccine. love vaccines. mean shoot up. But, troubling fast tracked? Also, incredibly difficult make vaccine? much vaccines, again, think want take one. allow skip 10 years? seems troubling. Awfully optimistic think huge number people us least willing get vaccine. course did. innuendo haircuts giveaway dog whistle. said, agree protests, partisan view protests impacting spread virus one many reasons country totally failing comes COVID-19.  First - living ""the richest country tbe history mankind"", live developing country 500 euro month living wage people make less that, know people living 150 euros matter. 

Second - asking people look get hired top positions. simply asking really enough money increase entry level wages without artificial increase. deal: giving $200 100 cashiers sums 20.000$ month. also give everyone cashiers, like 10 people that. Maybe keep proportions which, agree you, heavily top-sided, still give what, 100$ increase? thing - take it? even will, question still remains: enough money it? Printing money solution. Investing less infrastructure solution either. enough leftovers increase literally wages everyone earning living wage? 

And third - exactly living wage really? Say current living budget USA $2,500 monthly(googled NYC living wage asap, take example), paying EVERYONE $2,500 mean everyone earning 'living wage', lead inflation living wage ramp least $3,000. mention probably enough money tank first place.

The harsh reality society built around lucky folks cannot survive everyone would page. That's called socialism / marxism, leads communism dictatorship know history works paper. guess forced accept fact everyone earn decent living wage, unfortunate really. U.S needs terribly badly. Trump literally killing us. vaccine production years treat different coronavirus tweaked treat one. ended ago some... Oof, feel one. finally found courage call psych 4 months waiting list, sucks. happy see large signs every door HD today. happens vaccines mass-produced “winners”?  get sent Africa like Super Bowl loser t-shirts? could potential side effects vaccine?

I hesitant post want sound like anti-vaxxer even someone negative vaccine news.

I know drug issues like Thalidomide, much vaccines. know get mild version virus suffer extreme reactions, what, any, long term side effects observed vaccines? What's worst expect case? call doctor follow recommendations wearing mask. Quit giving politicians headline grabbing opportunities. They'd trying make look better, though. either even worse this. Yes, vast majority deaths, extreme illness old risk people. I’m getting shit load people That's partly much hope Oxford vaccine. monkey trials, waiting maximum effectiveness blood draws, sprayed virus would get sleeping Florida hospital COVID ward overnight without PPE. sign pneumonia. Still virus nose throat, clearly getting worse sign discomfort. asshole move. I’m boat. would wrong least striving to? sources? would definitely make sheltering place lot simpler - could take time work one.

I've ever played though; think state even lottery....? true. Many won’t finish high school all. guys condemned arrested. People sub smarter scientists working this, yeah basically anti-vaxxers. hear you. However, pulling wording article, goes:

“But statistic watch, according one U.S. epidemiologist: percentage people testing positive coronavirus, direction goes.” really hope ALFs plans place flu season. reddit math problem. 

It's America death study says kids 10 spread disease half often adults - schools closed. said possible difference spreading would disappear schools reopen. Im going run premise use vaccines.
Once infected/vaccinated significantly less chances contracting X virus, therefore...Im good!!  Health care workers, food manufacturing plants, fast food/restaurant employee’s grocery store employee’s. Get people vaccinated spread lessen. Sadly way get rid Covid-19 vaccinate every single person planet anti vaxxers won’t listen common sense. Realistically speaking virus isn’t going die time sadly. least science find way give people much effective vaccine immune system easily hit 40k day density joking? need counseling mental help. mean nicest way possible. joking good one! Ohhh. misunderstood post. sounds lot sensible. gonna lot traumatized youngsters over.....youngsters accidentally gave virus people know wound dying, didnt watched friends family lose battle this....Still others lost grandparents mothers fathers nursing homes.....Those lost loved ones made through......Those stayed home ride died home, God’s sake....

Edit: Special mention —— Essential workers Hospitals see people die result, final goodbye calls make behalf patients....Any essential worker kept working, caught virus, survived either lost job go back work (how going look jobs way this?)....Those stable life lost job this, lost everything. list goes Im sure....


Many Many people still fail realize gravity pandemic, real tragedy.....if real tragedy... problem even healthy people get extremely ill...  I’m particularly worried scenario. It’s passing contact, everyone wearing mask, social distancing likely practiced. odds transmission negligible would one humanities greatest achievements 21st century far. vaccine 12-18 months away March, would best predictions nearly half! quell disease New Year, pillar scientific achievement. depends much $ got open air **not** narrow plexiglass corridors.

Did mean write instead not? I’ll try remember that. Thanks! 

Yea, it’s joke! People say “you aren’t likely die” seen issues?! Please show get awesome MIT mask, $1 filters it. 

Oh wait. understand, don’t republican white males old parents, immune compromised relatives? agrees him? what?

the flu vaccine 50% effective since 2013 want say: alone. anxiety issues well, LARP roleplay ways deal them, that's gone feel mental health declining high speed. certain point felt numb depressed checked psych: 4 months waiting list.

The best hold on, suppose.
(But know alone, feelings valid &lt;3) people saying 3 weeks hospitals right edge overflowing surely happen. already acknowledging ""lag"" rise cases June.

And 3 weeks later people still saying thing. Ugh house months delivery. go home depot get dirt, one time, started delivery it. even I'm sick all, want go hide somewhere Ahhh...the Okinawa technique.
Gotcha. many single-parent families, too, even fewer options child needs stay home. seen Lancet they've said Lancet? different things US another failed experiment. know getting much shit. give shit ain't directing one else to. Myself, think need *both* vaccine better health care longterm, asking vision was. agree uniquely unhealthy US lifestyle always going equal worse results, probably part US hard hit this, sure.

I think anything ""an election year"", though, since USA like four percent world. 96% planet hoaxing manipulating anything USA. That's impossibly silly. worry current administration states accept foreign vaccine. several states follow suit. US would wait January current administration power start clear anti science folks. article seems bit optimistic, saw similar article vaccine bit honest progress, hopefully moot point. know used kids would throw baseless insults couldn’t make argument say anything substance. Sadly it’s like lot “adults” days clearly like you! Congrats One us wrong. hope it’s me. instead wishful fantasies government reallocation funds stimulus checks, have, need deal reality federal government subsidizing working-class point time duration pandemic. Looking European countries bastions good decisions nothing people they're work 6+ months. Things need kept normal possible,despite pandemic, order weather storm, fantasizing nonexistant stimulus starving street due nonpayment rent so, embrace pleb mentality? Ban pleasure vessels, legal cumming I'm telling this. 

The guy room CDC meetings companies told telling oath congressional testimony. first one? So...just stop testing. Problem solved. /s line. doors outdoors. spacing would depend people front behind choose exercise social distancing. truly wish could disagree you. Sadly, think far gone. im thinking everything delayed till then. it'l april-june except stay locked third month till vaccine ready.  Hospitals full (unable accept kind patient) bad way slice it. 
So ultimately, matter someone hospital ""with"" ""because""? Idiots refuse vaccine leave barn door-sized hole herd immunity coronavirus could use attack people **can't** receive vaccination due legitimate health reasons. ""on them"". People options. like employers cool people staying home pay kid sick (even less likely kid seems healthy might exposed). can't blame victims shitty system make money. Presymptomatic spread happens children well adults asymptomatic children still spread this. mayor Atlanta claims husband infected child didn’t symptoms. course know parents send children symptoms school. always send sick children school every year. Plus lot children get minimal symptoms..like say runny nose headache. Similar mild allergies. I’m TX. Many people get symptoms regularly it’s caused lot people spread covid Bc thought normal allergy symptoms. Israel said opening schools huge mistake. might harder logistics perspective. common like 1% people short immune response? without lockdown = several times cases,deaths happen. person telling doesnt wear mask, wash hands often. buddy 20 years medical field he's saying stay home, wear mask. messaged another health care worker another state - say hospital work full. God no. want fun campus friends. Same. like mom various reasons two strokes even fifty, would death sentence got this. dad's probably fine hear mess up, idea. wish people would realize news mean throw caution wind end beds people deaths believe phases congruently.  Phase 2 usually dosage continued safety. Phase 3 moves testing thousands people get better picture vaccine impacts population whole.  That's partly many vaccines take long go clinical trails.  case, millions people infected, bit easier get data quickly. know already are. Yea somehow awful shit that’s going 2020 I’ve getting shit together. can’t wait life get back normal. way things going Florida, perhaps start hopping onto boats back Cuba.  fair expect employees police public, don't. still gaming field spin positive PR jobs citizens let get away clean. Yeah juvenile know ones worth. probably sitting saying thing easily significant medical conditions job still. Fuck everyone else right? Like fuck juvenile ass working ass since 15 fighting 3 crippling diseases struck work able afford anything able safely work risk death virus. Fuck grandparents look sacrifice make sure they're ok right? fear change lack empathy toward humans you. Funny enough, I'd give shirt back needed it. 

Unfortunately, majority Americans mindset. That's going shit. Lockdowns simply work. Whenever open, rise cases. can't hide virus. true lockdowns helpful covid spread long term, European countries ticking cases, openings? Technically blows. Ventillators blow... Same. Still need replace first set AAA batteries. logistically fly in? Wear ankle bracelet? asking questions bad faith, rule good enforced. Hell, France mask wear actually...  Trumps gonna take credit it. guarantee it. differ definition smart. study this.. also need fast contact tracing get R 1. Needs 2 prob put covid death. positive, means homeboy spreading last two weeks.

Delayed test results useless.... Hm seems provide tax dollars telecom indusrty build infrastructure expand broadband internet access throughout country. Surely said telecoms pocketed money didn’t build promised infrastructure people go jail. reason didn’t go jail people tear thrm brick brick. want hug friends much. Gotcha. case, thank adding that! use both, prefer die later date. None changes reality fact focus back-and-forth unnecessary collection data face supposed free press, available consequence predecession.

They make enough money ads. best hope point honestly. common sense, orange guy tell followers wear fucking mask. likely listen tells to.  New York still fully opened. CA goat fucked badly.  heard NPR US projected 900,000 deaths (as lower estimate) current rate going. wonder curve mind. wonder going let get point. That's lot deaths.

EDIT: posted comment elsewhere, put too. Unfortunately, without hard evidence, think wishful thinking. found article explained bad would actually achieve herd immunity without vaccine (not Italy, using US example):

""To reach herd immunity COVID-19, likely 70% population would need immune. Without vaccine, 200 million Americans would get infected reach threshold. Put another way, even current pace COVID-19 pandemic continues United States – 25,000 confirmed cases day – well 2021 reach herd immunity. current daily death rates continue, half million Americans would dead COVID-19 think even Italy made bad. think everyone else right: Italy's lockdown worked. slack much another outbreak happens, could another wave death again. Evil Tests! trying make Trump look worse possible. Yeah kidding.

Palm Springs/Palm Desert: Currently 110+, beaches, everyone rich old everything expensive, hot, shitty.

LA (excluding areas inland like Antelope Valley/Santa Clarita): 80F, Beaches, cheaper overall, etc.

It's brainer get winter Palm Springs 70 good stuff LA ""Cold"" (for pansies live there). Absolutely. I'm sitting thinking ""This news article exaggerating clicks. estimates suggest vaccine August 2021, all""

But *so desperately* hope I'm proven wrong. sizeable number population whose life made better pandemic. article awhile ago, think 1 3 people said life better right now. 

I bet ratio within reddit demographic much higher. already near me. two small hospitals suppose cater 4 different counties. Here's interview research team leader, Sarah Gilbert: poised this--they working MERS vaccine used adenovorus platform Covid19. HUGE advantage vaccine creates cells well antibodies, means effective long term, possibly 2-3 years booster needed. relatable death rates lowest since March. Well least proper Village People Karaoke likely higher initial spread/later taken measures. middle mars numbers already way higher neighbors. health ambassador manual Gotta get ready 2020 land stingy ray shuffle! Yes defies business standards. Usually they'd announce off-loading shares part strategy. agree. actually worked one major investors (not nearly well enough contact him, organized things together conversations), he's certainly type divest early. Still, never high moderna. think concept works likely need dose adjustment. time see side effects phase one study, bad news much larger studies. able filter old info? shit afwaid uf da sniffles. ...so far That’s guys do. Stay safe friend. They’re seeing results short 3 months people virus. could part reason people getting reinfected. Hopefully vaccine longer results. 

Edit:
Link study showing antibody levels infected individuals 2-3 seem answered questions, guess confirming give shit yourself, party conversation.

You obviously going start caring people discussion online give shit.

Go waste someone else's time. done self contradictory nonsense. experience seems good thing nowadays might help lol. Same. Getting hard pause life made realize triggers, things don’t ever want go back to. Also, cultivated new good habits new mental freedom Saving link later reference. 👍🏻 gives shit, long friends/family vaccinated don’t give shit morons anymore. Let get virus. Won’t fly “smart” governor long immune response last though... isn’t big question? True, lot commenter said also true. guess I’d say it’s margins political poll asking questions range answers gauging opinions whereas vaccine trial like three yes questions disqualifies it. 

Tho I’m simple artist robotic machining technician could waaaay off. Sharing caring. people taking seriously care facts. belief fake, willing consider nothing make change.  There’s uncertainty potential severity virus, there’s extreme takes peppered throughout subreddit, reek secondary anxiety and/or PTSD. 

While I’ll clarify I’m epidemiologist there’s certainly lot don’t know virus, there’s also tendency believe fringe cases properly studied constitute norm.

To reiterate - virus serious, taken seriously (wear mask limit non-essential frivolities), otherwise stand original post.  P No. Covid cause lot problems surround cardiovascular system right highly likely infected symptoms COVID cause. misread 'absolutely crack' first, gonna lie kinda disappointed article, expectations... thing obfuscate truth lie would declining deaths good news? I've witnessed lot people going back people compatible with, clearly going break either shortly pandemic ends. share every bit cynicism, factor considering lots parents young children whose jobs really essential - healthcare workers, utility operators, food production &amp; distribution workers, etc. - physically able simultaneously perform vital functions also take care children they're home school. 

So yes, schools need open economy keep running, also includes part economy makes sure people continue clean drinking water. Walmart ""requiring""  sounds like ""excuse"" paragraph right article families, local media vice-president Colombian Medical Federation said Palermo Clinic capital denying ICU’s patients older 75 years old.

Translation - ""We didnt confirm story, people told us true."" Safer going Publix. They're going shell virus offshore that’s American way. Damn it, let dream!!!! became political said masks work initially. bs, that's political issue. End 2021, end 2020? seems like long time countries (other US/UK) get vaccines, course, know nothing logistics delivering vaccines populations.  would assume would continue allowing enough testing get point. Usually karen asks speak manager. Mike Wallace sez “attaboy” great beyond. something like 3rd country even consider getting it. Give money private initiatives lead finest, Best people Goya MyPillow, overseen Jared. /s misinterpreting saying would take 2 years 850 million syringes - enough 2 shots covid vaccine additional flu shots. given year 130-150 million flu shots hand. Covid vaccine 1 shot, know everyone get it, need 200-300m syringes first year. Sounds doable. 

They may short flu vaccine honestly point less important? Lol. Wait economy already run ""socialist handouts"" corporations? fuck individuals? 

I'm trying figure give shit real quick. figure category in, expedite end ""socialist free money"" youd benefit see feels.

 one closing economies. shifting. twat natural reaction take advantage people would take realize means everyone gonna figure new way make money new world. 

All someone like see situation opportunity, seem care ""i got mine fuck you"". 

The rest us gonna help hard time. I’m sorry isn’t front page every news site? can’t find anywhere. I’m skeptical. Make public nudity, right? May well make lifestyle.  result published tomorrow, July 20th, lancet... Unless read before, pretty doubtful. chain escalated quickly think that’s great context people think we’re actually getting somewhere terms herd immunity states mask requirements even come close  Exactly, knows virus real, cares himself.

&amp;#x200B;

I surprised he's using opportunity make money though. Imagine profit gain made ""Make America Great Again"" masks...-\_- hometown -45 last winter! kidding mate. reality hope everyone needs vaccine gets one fast possible lot people signed willing take risk. mean honestly Alabama parties kids trying infect fuck it. people want volunteer I'd moral qualms it. Even vaccine protect (it seems likely will), likely healthy 20 year old going skate minor symptoms anyhow. They've released Phase data similar times Oxford three Phase III clinical trials pretty much fully enrolled UK Brazil South Africa. Nobody else even started enrolling people Phase III yet. source example democrats thing? think matter time parents begin complain in-person students receiving better education online kids. comment made laugh much. “Crying English” 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂 topic related said, TIL patriot act expired. probably stay way, here's hoping. Even short article, sounds like still dazed. hope receives support needs heal emotionally. tax cut

The tax cut nobody asking stealth cut Social Security Medicare. Fucking dickheads. Well gotta start somewhere, think maybe miss President make mandatory everyone. may soon way introducing water system, much like fluoride. seems clear reason state Governor would allow county municipality require masks citizens purely political calculation total disregard for human life.

If governor allows section state require masks sections quickly gain benefit reduced transmission, hospitalizations deaths. those  statistics (as compared rest state without mask requirement) would simple  math see many deaths Governor caused result requiring masks throughout state. Therefore governor going allow masks required anywhere unless decides require masks everywhere. requires masks everywhere assumes maligned Trump therefore re-elected Republican base. 

No one convinced anything thinks paycheck depends convinced.  suppose pretty American attempt bring one's circumstances peoples' expense... would actually test everyone though. positivity rate population, positive rate tests. Tbh sentence learned sound like smart ass. worked. 😉 latest mask post POTUS desperate approval bill's goal put money economy. people still working still spending like normal, least that's assumption. federal government raised minimum wage even keep pace inflation. ""essential"" workers getting screwed long time now. Daily reminder hug grandma right unless taken 100% precautions last 2 are, site, get it, end fine. 1-3 10,000 infected people 45 die this, without adjusting comorbidities (thus, probably 0.1-1.0 10,000 healthy people 45). 3.2% ages 65-74 though, 19% aged 75+. Even antivaxxers far right wear live. heartening. We've got other's backs. convincing short happening them. goes people spectrums. People hardline stances issues, directly impacted seeing fault logic. It’s hard tell. theory, possible. Kansas turned around, least little bit. Missouri long ago ran Democrat - Jay Nixon. moderate, certainly anywhere close pure evil Greitens Parsons.

The way see it, it’s sort like asking country elect Trump again. substantial chance win. even knows? Paulding. Kids go back Aug. 3rd doesn’t look like they’re going change all.  Coronavirus. 🤦‍♀️ think Washington state, thankfully becoming normal people wearing one stick like sore thumbs. Even small redneck town I'm getting better better. China already partnering Brazil vaccine last heard. don’t know type deal made China, countries may unable test depending details. People learned Spanish Flu. got complacent forgot. It’s less enough time exposure transmittance GOING happen, that’s known truth school gives time exposure Yes older white people generally turn droves vote, people skew conservative. That's young people need register vote turn November. year, every election. especially year. Make priority. mentioned hot take decline. catch meant couple weeks. This, along fact outcome infection binary (dead totally fine), herd immunity crowd understand. hardship caused 1% population getting infected, expect next 59-79%* cakewalk.

*Depending R0 needed do. Australia gets first cases like this, shed light whether people actually getting reinfected, chronic persistent infection. Australia performs phylogenetic analysis every case, we'll see people testing positive second time different mutations virus would rule chronic infection, one - implying it. Welcome United Snakes
Land thief, home slave
The grand imperial guard where dollar sacred, power God thought read somewhere reason didn’t SARS MERS vaccine vaccine higher complication rate disease itself. work using similar SARS/MERS vaccine covid? Yes, soon found taking volunteers. lot WW1 troop movements weather though. Choices made would taken hospitals would stay trenches made Spanish Flu mutate way deadly (therefore making second wave deadliest) get injured fix guess everyone afford fight though. Especially economy. need know car love much  kind crazies Germany well. Luckily far apart. Apart fact can't find anywhere official pages New Zealand, could well emigrate, e.g. USA, declining, situations one learns appreciate security functioning health system state system.

Yes, work immigration New Zealand, USA even ""Special Arrangements"" list.

And think really understand brain drain is. primarily case developing countries, well-educated, mobile people leave country therefore missing country.  Countries like New Zealand


http://archive.stats.govt.nz/browse_for_stats/population/mythbusters/brain-drain.aspx#gsc.tab=0

Just look total amount. Less 1000 outbound less 2000 inbound. New Zealand relatively small. less people South Carolina. ""I've always done way"" wasnt point story, sorry confusion. 

I trying illustrate mail ballots normal bipartisan way voting lot people America, parties. 

What figuring ways prevent freedom vote home, exploited people committing fraud. 

Instead limiting options, let's make sure options valid secure, lot people prefer voting home huge list varying legitamite reasons, option taken away them. article say 30,000 trial vaccinations US. Couldn’t think better guinea pigs guys right now. Plus, winter comes kids Wisconsin literally dying hypothermia expect stay outside classes. Arizona sending hundreds patients New Mexico. People made fun wearing mask back March, April, May etc. ya know, ""experts"" telling us *NOT* wear masks. get bunch Karen's screeching wearing mask fucking park gubbumint tells so. Yes, absolutely. 

All I’m saying hurling towards extreme conclusion (Arizona deliberately manipulating hospitalizations) it’s getting hand. Thanos least cared something people getting worked sniffles? like anyone actually dies this, right?

If stopped testing, one would die covid! Yep, New England winter = November May. Every winter question still live here. Unfortunately parts America also areas people resisting masks, social distancing, likely vaccine. can't provide protections population refuses protections. told wear masks late March Philly. uhhh City Museum? Huh, assumed would take binary search tree approach - test huge sample, positive split half, test halves, rinse repeat positive sample(s) size small enough efficient individual tests. I'm sure there's optimized algorithm less lazy person could come with. probably already has, since pretty simple problem computationally (I mean relative to, say, correlating bunch telescope data give us goddamn black hole picture). certainly opinion. long ago Aussies, Kiwis, Canadians fought within British Army. India Pakistan raised significant numbers soldiers fight part British Army. awful lot people born bred island sacrificed awful lot really needed hand. would fitting way say thank you. And, politically speaking, what's point commonwealth reciprocate good actions.

My personal opinion event vaccine works, officials connected government make sure certain countries favoured others, whether Oxford group likes not. Services MI5 MI6 exist national security defence realm, reality national security enhanced helping certain countries, chiefly commonwealth countries United States. Oxford group might know yet, assuming gets point looks like they're really onto something visits made senior representatives Oxford people advise tow line.

I doubt made public; doubt average person even know happened: it'll simply another one things goes behind scenes allies. issue every person like nephew 100 really need money. People want go work can't. punish 100 people 1 person get it? bill written better thinking better overpay handful people miss giving millions help need.  people work, often person, put streaming video TV everyone's watching? music services people use? video games people playing online?

Let's face it, already helluva lot people working physically others keep entertainment running. Netflix get run bunch people working home. get pretending expert. makes feel better would say heard accelerated timeline much money people thrown problem rather cutting safety corners. worldwide monumental effort going on. It’s greatest thing, Jersey’s outbreak essentially contained right now. entire counties reporting new cases days. ""It's certainly possible probably small increase cases among protesting population,"" per NBC source. That’s direct quote. I’m sure rational thinking person simply read article says protests caused spread go “oh, well good enough me.” It’s fucking pandemic bro. doesn’t stop agenda, much sources say does. Thank help improve skills!  Sorry got called linking articles 'bout bodies funerary facilities comment bodies laying around days **in hospital** Isopropyl gallon $40 Amazon. better kids home lessons home? Yeah it’s better packing kids school, don’t think it’s better last spring.

But live Florida spent two hours outside yesterday sunscreen I’m color lobster, maybe I’m biased. also grew north hurts breathe outdoors winter, there’s still deal with. literally die hypothermia. Accurate. MAGAtard mother-in-law telling “super careful” went PARIS!! 3 years ago, said it’s “full terrorists dangerous”. lives Texas, bad health late 70s continues shop Home Depot, mask. also keeps flying around country visiting friends family pandemic. last airplane trip Georgia 3 days ago ...  vaccines train immune system... that's entire point them. world changing UK gets us vaccine, we'll call even everything else.

- rest world someone talk Paulding County please? Someone leak long. Right...because haven’t completed phase 3 determine whether protect covid not.........? real conversation? trolling? indeed meningitis trial published today.

Super useful comparing side-effect profiles given populations demographics exactly reporting methodology. accurate true. soup me! recall happening Italy American bullshit third world socialist health care standards could NEVER happen US. Ok, well, maybe NYC, socialists, made sense there, REAL America. Welcome apocalypse. one charge. medical staff stuck muster, competent federal response. Thoughts prayers....as empty rhetoric goes there. one's getting 1200 week guy LMFAO.

Way over-exaggerate. found this: [Sun Belt hospitals feeling strain virus’ surge — bracing California, doctors ­shipping patients many 600 miles away can’t cared locally.

I know people shipped Arizona California, interesting way flatten curve. move patients state, problem solved. Broken windows, mean burning buildings, looting, throwing bricks? talking Covid deaths, talking rioting, defined violent civil disorder. Covid fuck nation throwing lives wolves many people power absolutely need ousted held accountable, know damned thing I've protect vulnerable family member gets worse. could stopped months ago there's plenty fault citizens' lack responsibility. fuck err side caution nationally volatile period history concern. Vaccine R&amp;D pfizer pearl river ny could also hospitalization weekends naturally lower.

We've seeing weekly wave since start. Wednesday Thursday another story. Yes, used places like Washington even New York. Florida Texas.  Houston also better, supposed going roof new hospitalizations Texas 1-2 weeks behind Arizona. could even dangerous think. Biden wins Florida, DeSantis refuse certify electors deny Biden electoral votes. enough governors this, could throw election US House, way state gets one vote...and would 26-24 Republicans...
The Guardian interesting piece Even COVID, I've never felt like I'm part America, allowed experience things fully American. I'm trying part support community doctor, showing day uplift treat fellow Americans.

Straddling worlds, never part any, hope things see people having. That's (Taiwanese) Asian American experience.

I also fear what'll happen people start personally experiencing loss acutely run treatment capacity ICUs, and/or hatemongering leaders incite anger people look like me. going get worse next months. years dedicating trying good American citizen met spittle, fists, brick? try dwell there's uncertainty, growing day. They're *now* starting batch/pool testing? work vaccines? say would interesting history books that's sure Dear Jacksonville, get stiffed. americans biggest crybabies world.

'cuz, know, freedom....

It's right go around infecting everyone else. needlessly endangering employees, also customers vendors.  

Liability reckless endangerment, willful disregard safety, covered immunity. realize Oxford university company? Fuck it, give Nobel Prize Literature too! 
Is source sort B-cell response Oxford vaccine produced? (I see plenty talk antibodies cells) 

Is implied B cells created (because antibodies created B cells create antibodies)? Pennsylvania mostly spared I'm day 12 waiting results. Even ""good"" states problems delays. favor visit sub then, lot people fear mongering certainly help. people forced choose job life implemented monthly UBI. Even bare minimum like $1000 month would help people significantly. Hell, could serve corporate establishment interests still afford UBI every American. 

Will Congress Trump administration literally drained life give working class people little bit financial relief? ridiculous lengths go avoid helping people. Build wall current virus spread due actions taken roughly week ago, maybe longer depending delay testing. Saying brink meaningless either retracted brink, it, past week ago.

It's like, Florida's virus 'Out Control,' Los Angeles might also situation. Similarly, take week two careful distancing see control agian. would admitting China something good  go champ? thought gonna talk statistics. Like 6% population represents 50% violent crimes. No? done stats now? Honestly feels like going Kenny Powers type vibe forgot that's satirical fictional character funny likable real life.

There's reason real life guy character loosely based washed league get even get coaching office job single club. Even though 6'4 lefty threw upper 90's good enough waste time developing shitshow came him. ""ChAdOx1 nCoV-19"" looks like sarcasm text. LoL. 

Jokes apart, great job Oxford. Looking forward get vaccinated. World changing, living like 3-4 years now. 

Between vaccines seeming ever likely within year, potentially rollout fall wider distribution early 2021, plus treatments - pandemic part crisis going behind us mid next year latest.

That said, period time going studied next several years decades, absolutely forgotten. Canada melting, flooding, fire time. nowhere run climate change finally demands dues. danger combining ethos ""falling line"" goal post moved constantly amounting form gaslighting. tweet guy always gets flack (and well should, disputing that) said there's reason general public mask up, medical personnel masks, communities suffer. believe believed 1) true 2) necessary broadcast rather saying nothing something else. feel like way tweet structured supposed make us focus part healthcare workers need masks general public. purely mathematical outlook, wrong, HCW greatest likelihood exposed well subsequently transmitting became infected. 

But problem is, he's muck. members administration expressing anti-mask sentiment? grounds call out. wishes urge change public opinion? People finding credible. honestly feel bad him. Covid mere bump road, hang mate Dude it’s Florida. gotta pump numbers up, rookie numbers!!!! Restaurants amazing business NY. saw Texas well allowed open. struggle keep social distancing crowds rather business itself.  term expires, current powers president automatically transfer newly elected president. point, even locked bathroom refused come out, secret service could break open door, grab him, physically remove him. like could get military defend him; commander chief anymore.

Yeah no, there's guarantee this. We've seen analyses planets' orbits used suggest unseen planet solar system. seems less radical that.

We're looking reasons countries different patterns mortality. least seems like plausible hypothesis tested. agree everyone. also grief around able go funeral loved ones died causes. importantly.. one peer reviewed.

I hope voters remember deserves axe election night midterms presidential elections.

Lmao @ ""axe"" censored quillotine is, metaphorically. Imagine French Revolution got censored every time used word quillotine. okay, conservative family member said he's ""one good ones"". shit not. doesn’t stop agenda, much sources say does.

What agenda? Sadly dude American issue political issue. matter party Americans selfish, dumb obey sadly :/ forget jobs like waiting require tips lot income. can't live $2.35 hour alone.

In countries I've to, tipping exceedingly rare done event truly exceptional service (think Michelin star quality). still make least minimum wage. say permenant, saying possible younger healthy person get permenant organ damage. 

Even damage permenant, still causing people worse health possibly years. beginning November? fuck even talking about?

The first confirmed case COVID-19 US end January. break 1,000 confirmed cases March 6^th.

Up end March beginning April, public health officials *not* recommending general public wear masks. complicated. heard 10-11 days, like driving car night without lights discussion Germany well valid reasons opening schools. classes already back school last couple weeks. 

Children need social contact need learn. video conferences answer that, better hope parents and/or schools afford equipment needed it.  
Sometimes schools also refuge situation home good. parents stressed manage job children home, worsen problems. Imagine kid, stuck abusive household right now..

There plenty reasons open schools course. least needs ongoing open discussion. need weigh pros cons, try come good safety rules maybe weekly testing scheme identify hotspots school infections brought wider community. want control infection rate, maybe keep something else that's less essential closed longer instead. vote would bars, churches gyms.. determine that? Forgetting millions dying diarrhoea 500,000 already dead malaria, dengue fever? Sure, vaccine may ready fast, doesn’t make one GREATEST medical achievements CENTURY. many things happening medicine, cancer research, stem cell, crisp, sure, vaccine convenient Nobel prize handed out. want vaccine much anyone else I’m it, please don’t idiot it. heartbreaking. hope sister way cope; can't imagine toll must take someone. Damn, live stinky old Michigan like 350.

But keep mind, everyone getting maximum amount state, likely getting portion.

1200 week tho, holy shit. That's like double got.  may yet another vaccine manufacturer churning things out. Excellent. argument let's continue cycle debt pity parties save economy built debt pity parties pity parties debt. following Keynesian philosophy Paradox Thrift, makes sense. However, doesn't. Here's short post find counter argument Keynes' bullshit part patient brought CT scan hooked back empty O2 tank 20 minutes resulting brain death otherwise alert patient. He's circlejerking Well, it’s really type job give lowest bidder.

Around pre schools 2 year waiting lists, least COVID, you’re looking like $1,300 3 days week, $1,650 full time. It’s high cost living area families parents working. Please stay November. still want move that, lot people right behind you. Tell Pops careful new cases back peak states. midwestern states better Illinois Michigan. rest seem back earlier peaks (which nearly bad NY, still). states middle true 2nd wave, except Missouri Indiana daily case numbers started low (apparently) slowly continued rise time, never appearing dip. approved **COVID treatment** emergency use order. 

I'm sure arguing this. masks, indoor ac circulating virus? good luck [The ""circus"" never happened before, suddenly nobody wants work, unemployment levels roof... add up.


My company similar problem warehouse employees. Truth pay shit job physically taxing. turnover always pretty high reason. past, people took jobs accepted shit pay choice got burnt moved brother co-workers started asking less hours company, qualify unemployment. One showed check $2 change, also qualifies 600 bucks, received amount too...


As said bill written mantra better give less. people abusing assholes. millions need feed families work industries jobs simply available right now. 


Again, please keep mind personal experience reflective bigger picture. wish Canada would - areas have, mine. We’re cusp resurgence city numbers keep going it’s matter time. Even something small mandatory masks public transit would make huge difference imo. Ah, bad. reread makes sense Australia pays higher. Honestly, reason Canadians move US. Always comes pay. Amazon Microsoft Canada compared Amazon/MS US comparison, especially given climate lifestyle Vancouver Seattle similar Nah. Project Veritas alt-right lie machine. forge fake videos. awful part people working American public. Exactly, can't go back job called back yet. Oh yeah, lets love lives devoid leisure ability pursue interests, saving every last scrap barely survive potentiel pandemic disaster may may happen. great life, gee wonder people making shit money savings. lets blame anyways, instead looking around supposedly wealthiest society human history wonder life shitty many Oh. Guess actually keep statues, then. First all, virus decimate economy unabated itself. large enough percentage people *not* going spending money way would prior COVID.

Secondly, broader subset people simply listened going back two - three months started wearing masks distancing guidelines put place, re-opening could happened without massive uptick cases.

Pro-economy (in terms COVID debate) people loudest voices urging others wear masks public. makes sense people failing grasp connection mask functioning economy. biggest clue virus become politicized beyond rationality, whether right want hear not, large chunk blame falls squarely Commander Chief. great hear. honor dying another man's wallet parents hoped glorious day birth, since abortions allowed. Canada educated country world, 56% adults hold post-secondary degree diploma. imagine good social security system could shut business save money workers would fine would still come back work over.

imagine many ""freedumb"" people refuse wear masks entire thing 2 months everyone go back enjoying things masks on.   argument certainly made challenge trials young healthy people can't extrapolate work way older populations might really speed overall process. mentionned. already available drug. sure keep confusing president saying science. moron head country.

Serious.

Vaccine Sept 1st. get it?

I'm scared side effects rushed vaccine. wife get pregnant, want find 9 months Sept vaccine gives kids allergies disease like Zika virus.

(I 100% vaccination believe cause autism). places restricting hours they're trying limit congestion? workers' safety? even that, social distancing harder crowded store, numbers show risk exposure heightened time vs congestion? 

That exact thought process heard kind thing country...  
I find logic relation limiting hours minimizing exposure/possibility contagion. Quite opposite, makes worst/harder control. 

I comment ppl analyze things, non provided reason basis. work then. work now. Coronaviruses around long time researching vaccines SARS type coronaviruses almost 20 years. got this. hope talk soon pencil $. would say economic recovery burgeoning. true? see mention Canada ordered enough two diesel every Canadian.

American, absolutely faith administration pull managment supply chain, plenty evidence display coronavirus disaster natural disasters past three years. Could also there’s never working vaccine coronavirus ever before, despite MERS SARS like third colds coronavirus (I’d pay good money working vaccine common cold!) - potential vaccines coming super fast (4x faster vaccine ever developed, ever) given this. I'm willing share syringes. Oh, uh, yeah, uh, also, Considering politicized whole pandemic see certain segment population taking vaccine dUmBass lIBS DeEp staTE like -- something may propose locally. We've already pushed school back September (which good, initial plan really, really bad). current plan bit better, still great. expect another push October so, continued pushes long vaccine looks near horizon. gets pushed, expect see high school middle school online elementary spread in-person.

""past new vaccines"" affected *any* population terrible way? fully understand I'm going get anything September already distributed, that's good sign. That's I'm hopeful for. I'm petrified Trump going say (the US) better one coming going approve one, something else block available US.  :-( real problem people starting go other’s houses isn’t anything weekend.

edit: get awhile people edit top comments. people taking literally. comment meant statement florida news time shady things. desantis everything power downplay pandemic. certain republican officials want stop testing much. soft cap powers want downplayed. actually read article? Bright said may 5, said ""under current conditions"" enough syringes. Since government countries world ramped production. even says article provided difficult produce United States already produces billions it. government put contract end may, almost month Bright declarations, 260 million dollars. Right we're looking production 450 million syringes Covid vaccine. 450 million? that's estimate required since enough vaccine produced. pharmaceutical companies would estimate production billion vaccines end year, would billion syringes too. wear mask bc keeps bothered others. stand 12 feet people, bc like bothered. say excuse maybe fault, I'll damned stand asshat mean, rude, ect anyone trying make trying they've instructed do. stand opinion. Exactly. good!  doesn’t care millions people. cares himself! get little gold star ⭐️ 5 months? Try 4 years article dashes remaining hope bipartisan stimulus bill passing all, never mind end week. announced neighboring one hybrid, split, yes age banded (k-6, Jr/Sr high).  surprise me. I'm really scared guys. isn’t Black Death obese people. It’s definitely dangerous still Black Death. Vietnam response eye opening. Yeah pretty sure highest bidders front line. say correct way know that’s way it’s gonna work. People need home. government paying so. Companies literally got billions dollars - think folk need find job pays squat could expose deadly virus...b/c...reasons???

Dude...stop drinking Kool-Aid - bad you. Leronlimab press release Tuesday, here's hoping. same, parents caught there's decent chance they'd die. live type sadness utter hopelessness life. Subtext visual investigation reveals several Chinese companies using Uighur labor contentious government program produce P.P.E. pandemic. track equipment U.S. around world. feel like parents rooting doom they’re anti trump. even admit sometimes. 

To fair don’t like trump either argument he’s hurting country enough own, don’t need help him.  didn’t go well. Also hard human trials vaccine disease longer exists. would unethical challenge trials samples labs, obviously, see vaccine generates antibodies, see thing covid vaccine enough prove efficacy. science come time. new virus, therefore partial science. doesn’t mean pessimists wrong, pessimists. Humanity always dealt pandemics.  always part life.  got really lucky last 100 years. meant health conditions would make recovering impossible. 

Also agree moron, probably influenced bunch people wear mask. Idiot understatement. let’s let actions take away learning. died horrible virus, wanting know ill high blood pressure, diabetes. Since dying 31 virus low probability. Yup. used rule 105-B-1. trade plan automatically activates stock goes certain levels. Literally designed insiders sell without incurring speculation like thread insider trading problems. Won’t work everyone knows somebody died covid. Take bailout funds. medical funds. Shouldn’t problem. anecdotal, guy 2 blocks buddies parents went something totally different. Caught covid hospital died. tight him, I've house. Rest peace Simpletons Coronaviruses around long time researching vaccines SARS type coronaviruses almost 20 years. ignore 3 months ""heres lowering curve means"" dont eliminate it, keep infection rate manageable level Rounding .26-.60 .2 actually stupid though. assume low end, 25% low, high end, 200% low.  that’ll happen phase III trials hit significance, could take 2-3 months start date started area high enough infections Look lot people Texas reacted Governor tried enforce mask wearing. intelligent people planet. completely agree mods would've removed post changed original title Everyone knows homeschooling produces highest scientific learning outcomes modified version already existing vaccine extensively proven safe. vaccines currently development one least worried safety. Here's Bexar's case/death charts spikes deaths cases, even include totals tonight. Coronaviruses around long time researching vaccines SARS type coronaviruses almost 20 years. He’s making bad judgments millions people. ME. stupid. smart thing

Lol move US bro? never wanted something true bad life Id say, winter, much fucked up. too. Jerking front mother wearing mask me. need warmth. Yes. know there's contracts.

That tell us anything actually beyond generic ""end year 2020/2021.""

Let alone October like thread discussing.

By points they'll 100 million end 2020.

And 500 million 2021.

Bright estimates need 850 million.

Because vaccine likely [take 2 they'll surge people wanting flu vaccine. vaccine distributed one big go. come least months first go risk groups, first responders, etc. cool, every fool take get better chance getting vaccine  Seize boats ship home bus. Word spread pretty quick start enforcing ban unnecessary border crossing. Can't wait anti-vaxers go crazy one. monumental error judgement Fauci lied said masks work wanted supply preserved medical workers. Mask mandate issued early smoking crack, bro? Almost every single country planet got outbreak control. developed nation still getting asses handed us. Actually ventilator blows sucks dense New York City? live loop Houston definitely case. even close. Like said, there's minimal contact customers, communication phone work outside. virus may still playing role. could also they're making much nothing home. blame would anyone want work making money home? problem I'm finding right employer Might want add farmers group. People need eat. federal money counties simply money financially support people. 

A stay-at-home order would push hundreds thousands people county poverty/homelessness/hunger.  Same, last day outside March 3rd me. Locations hospitals are: Lodi, Fresno, Stockton, Rancho Mirage, Visalia great! next thing heard take years get NEEDLE stock appropriate level even vaccinate everyone. mean shoot. It’s whole planet. 

But I’m sure phase in. High risk first such. 

Get comfy mask. Trump administration still can't get personal protective gear front line medical staff, six months infection spread. mention inadequate Covid-19 testing contract tracing.

How ever going successfully administer distribution vaccine September? Vote candidates support living wages Medicare all. Both, neither perfectly. it’s essential shown Texans aren’t taking precautions. anti-masking population reduced. non-medical masks work, sourcing medical masks better sources. Uyghur gulags unfortunately cheapest way manufacture ship them. problem, that? onslaught covid patients coming waves, big waves, healthcare professionals much limited resources. There's absolutely excuse hospitals, clinics testing facilities constantly scrambling procure PPE testing supplies, among things. thing like Trump transparent is. Everything tell. lacks subtlety intelligence. Dumb ass. doubt successful Oxford vaccine stop work Modena vaccine. thought teaching class?  waiting second lesson :-) would shocked.

That said, I'm holding breath. wish tomorrow today could know wish several months today could get vaccine! think said made sense!  loophole open begin with... everything gradations stupidity  put comment next time wapo nyt think. work wall Street journal many others Hey bud, boat you. 

Friends hanging whole lockdown period saying whenever invite me. think get still ask hang course tell again. sucks truly live someone risk able live something happened doing. Take getting mad compliment, means cherishes friendship :) Wow, spent last hours reading posts really deserve published book. doctor incredible writing ability reminds lot Stephen King's style. hope day find energy time publish these. must read. got mines reputable place too, mostly talking disposable surgical masks. Yea tell pandemic either makes relationship stronger breaks middle ground. really gotta close up.....that rife pitfalls even funny. Hes considering case count case count leader nation Pandemic. He’s comparing numbers nations leaders numbers, believes shouldn’t test young healthy make case count go up, whereas maybe Italy didn’t test young healthy regularly, “scoreboard” inflated going country’s weren’t. Sorry bad run sentence. Although book published (by niece?) says people take exams him! Would call president “effective”? Underestimating Donald Trump became president. Same. live parents avoid going much possible. Mask usage among customers work close 100% I'm still scared shitless someone (possibly myself) slip I'll bring home. parents 62 71 respectively massive issues would aggravate disease I'm still concerned. would also hate pass vulnerable customer.

I'm also concerned myself, obviously. I'm 30 years old decent health numbers probably side I'm invulnerable. Hopefully multiple get approved; multiple stockpiles/factories deployed, people allergies/reaction one type get other, competition pricing.

Or even one fails humans, maybe used cats pets catch it. It’s stupid talk average age people / testing going forever testing people nursing homes ICUs. Average age going really doesn’t tell us anything younger people get tested couldn’t before. biohacker, health nut, healthy person DAE parties bad?? Thanks. hate everything said comment looking for. title video, yes that's accurate terms they're trying say. !RemindMe 3 months Yep. I'm NKY basically entire region getting fucked right now. COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVID! (In Kirk ST2:TWoK yell) Americans common nationality Reddit hugely underrated comment. Also instruct go CDC.gov yet don’t provide link. Unsurprisingly, people distrust data CDC. necessarily

http://www.columbia.edu/~jls106/galanti_shaman_ms_supp.pdf

(a small definitive study implies might want keep open mind) bright side, you’re past part people take turn worst. You’ll likely fine even virus. one major purposes lockdown buy time testing PPE usage. federal level we've gone nowhere. lack knowledge insight fault. I’m sorry hear that. case, I’d say try push creating things. doodle, make song, try make new dance. you’re politics, volunteer phone banking home. understand might frustrated seems like you’ve exhausted options pass time. I’m sure you’ll get rut you’re in. Gloves literally nothing unless you’re changing time touch something. wash hands. hear Disney! |:( end day shut hurts poor people most.

Not much exposing poor people death.

Choose life. Right?  it’s useful. understand people downvote comments like this. There's legitimate issue difference essential non-essential surgeries. Instead able call people 'non-essential' cancer surgeries specific hospital capacity covid cases wait state decided ok everyone come once. There's lot important data missing useful gauge appropriate levels response.

The levels over-reaction sides levels government populace insane. Ah yes, that’s longer common cold /s meaning normal person's exposure risk rate lower number people encounter even take precautions otherwise. 

i'm advocating anyone does, easier prevent deaths Texas NYC. Houston DFW vs NYC gets harder defend, even much smaller pop densities. response anything related Uighur labor accept commonplace move on? easy adopt ""no shit"" mentality feel still responsible thing understand details going supply chain. Nothing ever change everyone collectively sticks head sand tell ""everyone else it, care?""

Maybe something left future generations solve, stop us learning observing little shits people give 2020. you? wasn’t running trial. NIH was. Here’s results care look. first peer reviewed COVID clinical trial results, BTW. Look chronobiology STFU. There's end pandemic US theres vaccine. Theres much science deniers living country “Constant random failures” like TLDR Trump’s administration  hospitals? It’s got paywall click mobile add “partying adults teens 20s” vaccine list. people haven’t let pandemic slow one bit. There's reason close everything down.

There one good reason: do, could end infestation get Spanish flu deadly kill 50 million people globally. 

Did someone request repeat history? Let's not.

This numbers add media acting

And media.


It's life. Choose life time. Choose life politics loyalty political group.

Choose survive help rest us. diseases spreads connect right now.

We can't connect. Life, sex, music - get this.  work large scale construction. get credit 400 800 site tested positive.
They still haven’t found way protect us either. way Ah yes, Navy. surely able help Texas. good year they've far, navy........... Thanks advice I'll need practice 

No homo course could harness kind energy ecological crises. true lot people vulnerable able get it. asking loved ones high risk issues able get vaccine yes would protected long get it. vaccine, guess getting last? Floridian here. Neither Floridians seems. may right. agree wanna say hospital worker, environmental service workers highly unrecognized role play keeping everyone safe, often one lower paid workers building. vaccines get phase 1. phase 3 trips everyone up. Chinese learn Russian fate，is never surrender US。  Religious cults intent spreading Covid find spine never had? Make health code violation. add masks shirts shoes service. think NIH scientists lying NEJM phase 1 results? got glad asked. get accused ""anti vaxxer"" time &amp; NOT. 2004, working early intervention &amp; w/3 agencies. interviewed w/a 4th &amp; needed proof ""mmr"" titres. Got blood work &amp; needed 1 component. primary said w come booster. ended covered spots, face eyes swelled, slept constantly, many issues, almost died. Jefferson hospital specialist said get vaccines, ANY. never get flu shot &amp; taught years. Anyway sorry long really fearful heart condition. ""VAERS"" see people adverse reactions vaccines. 1 reason vaccines expensive add cost payouts people injured cost vaccine. anti vaxxer, dont want sick like that. scared get corona &amp; isolate scared can't get vaccine?? Sorry vent...be well~ immune system works.

Not necessarily. cell independent antibody responses (though mostly bacterial cell wall components). unironically posting geotagged selfie freedum Facebook mobile phone that's permanently clutched hand. political rally disguised church service, political identity wrapped defying orders liberals.  lag. Maybe month, definitely 2 weeks. People severe cases get admitted hospital roughly 10 days onset symptoms, takes days detiriorate. 2 weeks probably realistic timeframe majority cases.

It's also worth noting though several places tests lagging behind weeks, might actually see curves go almost simuntaneously since reporting deaths faster reporting positive test results immense backlog tests. disease killed lot people short time, even places advanced health care. challenge trial ethically extremely tricky. they’re able challenge trials, small number people. 50,000 person trial going give far better picture safe effective vaccine really real life. want pandemic over. need careful shortcuts. Otherwise could end repeating lot this. used work Disney Global Security HQ! people would surprised easily Disney police thousands park guests daily. Many employees come FBI, CIA, military Disney top game regards maintaining security.  Enact martial law. mandate masks. Martial law overrides Constitution. keep freedom speech time. wearing masks required. 100% Donald Trump doesn’t want vaccine November. I’m confident that, since basis excuse lose absentee ballots. 

I guarantee even ready, delayed November. article didn’t mention anything employees. assume customers can’t wear masks, employees can’t, either. Imagine wait staff WANTS wear mask told can’t work do. horrible predicament. risk physical health? family’s breadwinner? afford walk job?    Looks like Florida, Georgia, Arkansas, Tennessee's governors made statements *not close ever again* matter bad things get. 

I weep future. Oxford University gawd Kreygasm I’m exited scared. Wait it’s ready there’s group people saying “It’s vaccine causes autism poison no.” would kind pointless since can't seen indoors. think entire graduating college class 2020 feels right now?

Again, kept hospitals open necessity. kept grocery stores open necessity. weren’t insane outbreaks caused either alone, think would case schools? everyone dead. Idiot. think make 8 billion vaccines month?! humanity ever reached herd immunity disease without vaccine? I'm honestly asking, would love someone provide examples really know. Spanish Flu infected third world's population, think reached herd immunity there. remember hearing may reached measles point, I'm sure that. Measles also crazy high R0 like 14-15 makes bit realistic reach herd immunity. COVID's 2-3 R0 uncertainty around long immunity lasts, serious doubts we'd ever reach herd immunity without vaccine. Oh staph! Mmmm Cajun Navy... making hungry. source? I'm extremely skeptical graphic. stroke rate 3% would noticed now. Yes increased risk close that. Also graphic super misleading presentation b/c makes seem person get one effect, makes ""stats"" look worse. Seriously, verbal diarrhea Chernobyl proportions. It’s like want Donald unbelievably wretched, wish decent, want make educated decisions.  Texas also elects worst people statewide well. Statewide elections can't gerrymandered He’s counts,the votes! stole election Stacy A! South hot one way. Something something... Riker... something something... no, just... no. know cruel say, really hope UK gets vaccine US. know Trump's going turn around proclaim saved world. 'Cause best, **greatest**, amazing anything! like we're case study bad let stupid people hold office. Yea I’m also big tough. Fuck dummy lib-lib  I'm ya. Home since March bored. hey, least guarantee virus! keeps going. long state continues spike I've got plans anything differently right now. family healthcare FL can't imagine.  Thank god okay. I'd really interested find years disease spares mercilessly kills others. .....its oxford lol public official town admitted hospital double pneumonia. 8 negative tests. 9th positive. Lucky don’t live USA 😉😉 Churches account .02% covid word twisting facts. never said g people Never die. Young people die flu, strep throat, million things. based two separate studies NYC Italy estimated IFR .0016%(.000016) lower. Jesus would go around spitting people cure them. He's exactly good example use regarding disease.  really pro birth mean risk high vector like Americans? 😂 Uh, what? Plat tops $1,300 tax. Oxford University, root you! Please let's wrap already! two months ago lol. I'm already might get back early tomorrow announcement god  enough GOP senators see fiasco is.

But enough confront primary voters. I'd hoped would grow spines respective primaries, looks like expect GOP populism rest lifetimes. Outside, summer, mask, sparse line, asymptomatic carrier, well, maybe catch it. I'd say risk low, definitely zero.

But there's zero risk anything life. could catch Hepatitis someone poorly washed utensils restaurant hundreds situations like this, entire life.

I think Disney trying find balance. rest country balance, fact, would much fewer cases, hence lower risk, Disney could safely proceed. problem outside Disney. Indoctrination centers. that. would ban sub bet. amphibious assault virus's position. I? ticket everything. It’s huge jackpot, $4m, I’d happy debt free.  PEN correct abbreviation Sol Peruano.

Kemp is,a piece shit. track record speaks itself. said doesn’t represent truths. right here. know people think vaccine 'saving grace'. Even regular seasonal flu vaccine what, like 40% effective? Here’s thing pandemic insurance, covers known diseases. Even wouldn’t covered situation That’s good timely quote. gotta remind day. Thank you! keeps home. don’t really care me. want parents safe want able take care them. Damn, post solid af. Shame ReddiReich mods going remove it. misspelled burn. Yeah person you’re replying playing semantics easy understand point. worth seem like he's coerced/paid fuck America hard can. 

Might take generations dig holes he's put in. international influence, economy, social cohesion. hundreds scientists different universities collaborating this. Trials taken place Oxford, Imperial College London, Brazil etc. Let’s forget vaccine candidates well. Sinovac wants released September - earlier Oxford’s, Moderna BioNTech December. Imperial College London also wants reach ‘all billions people around world’ early next year - would truly bring society back Yea get paid more. think know one would rather lol. better yet, spend 15 minutes actually thinking believe realize fraud. need act stupid get infected. Covid loves making asses people like him.   Freedom free. Let's sacrifice liberty security. I'd prefer tree liberty need watered blood patriots tyrants lifetime.

See, use big words too. think every problem handled military. moment. said that, irrelevant, 9 year understands figures speech work, would understand Trumps OVERALL point. want keep hammering onto semantics nothing else. 

Go away already. impressing anyone. BLOCKED Emojis *bad* I'm Utah. Angela Dunn closest thing slug governor backbone.

I'm Dayton family there. Wife's family Utah sister teaches Az tend monitor UT, AZ, OH. 

Utah Ohio governor's dynamic response seems pretty similar. Actually Ohio seems done better job, willing lock things down. 

But AZ totally fucked SIL who's teacher going tough year. Kinda sucks cause mom's dying month can't really get time cause need hands deck. Nailed it. Sorry didn’t mean doubt ravedog based profiles multiple young people died covid, everything one seems off. There's good chance non-covid covid case. autopsy reveal covid, mean deadlier strain covid without coughs spreading population? even impeached twice? repeat.. yet “Trump alive, bolsonaro alive, boris johnson alive, putin alive” headlines like exist too. reality. Fuck planet dude, life sucks ass.  spend time money mental illness issue, terrorism. According wife's Chinese family, Chinese vaccine many years ago adverse effects. I'm trouble finding source since search engines returning results focused COVID entire family thinks democratic hoax disappear November, Despite put two week notice job outbreak enough done protect us. Available UK, necessarily US always, can't believe still explained, concern virus going kill you, going kill person next you.

So far, looks like vast majority people fine. know long term complications, now, look fine. problem thst nobody knows quite going react. must insulate protect others. Yaaaaaay. bodies street maybe? otherwise carpet. ChaChing! Thank Good Lord superintendent Mobile Co Public School system decided start school August. 

I hope Birmingham City educators. I've known many assholes come work sick ""dont want waste sick day sick"" would rather call something fun. I've one employer gave bonus call sick quarter, course made people come practically puking themselves. get vaccine September, would world reopen immediately? would need open phases/not open bit? I'm sorry government failed you, hope experience long term health repercussions. Proof God. least, whatever god merciful. hate Abbott much. recently decided encourage masks 4 months later. ffs. like 10's thousands. Even did, sit read them. press control + F. easily figure person made prior comments paint overall picture. one off, would used ad hominem attack like now.
 Spent time writing answer researching you! Wish upvotes. Airborne Aids true. saw two eyes Magic Kingdom Animal Kingdom weekend. One must stand side consume beverage food mask off. finished, mask goes back resume movement. I'd love take go shove face people said 'it matter stretch things out, people going die going die regardless'. No.   7 months? deaths start rise US untill March 22nd. Try less 5! Source. Might cheaper nuke half state.  think love you. Ok smart mouth, know whoever makes vaccine gunna make fuck tonne money know exactly you’re talking about, read something basically branch MERS vaccine jumped lot hoops (correct I’m wrong) basically something tweaked already Progress. 

I clarify doubt vaccine issues approved, recognize it’s best interest rush (in ways - race first vaccine, obviously rolling adverse affects later would blow them) definitely using logical scepticism, obviously I’m hoping read peer reviews I’ll feel met ethical safety obligations Well, Alabama less 1/5 population Florida. multiply 5 get little 8,400, still less Florida still high. “Deaths declining.” much ""winning"" get? mean, u kinda gotta go point. know, food... work... 
I wear one too. 
You wear bc right thing do. 
Say bs. Least u wear it.
Say real, u save lives. That's good.
Ez task clearly trending down. everyone acting like isn't? Yesterday's total lower Friday today's total lower yesterday's. Maybe much testing weekends explain lower deaths too. top that, hospitals supposedly going overwhelmed week seem still going strong. People need stop hyping start telling truth.  Imagine mad celebrity actually something good change.

I hope actually votes time. thing I'm pissed voting 2016. what's wrong America. Genuine question (my kids school age yet), situation summer school? American Empire dying incompetence. laughed power. really pretending somehow different Texas opposed rest world?! Maybe save heat part I'm aware that. rough young adults right now. need bring back rooming houses something.  rule still place, got vaccinated mandatory I'm wearing one. dark movie theater actually watch movies I'm taking mine off. source. Praise God *and* sign waivers......

Welcome **back** depends situation country state.

Schools re-opened many countries, although varying restrictions. great! Thank you. made ears bleed. Good job?  Vaccinate bartenders sex workers drug dealers want slow spread. That's good point. I'm certain weather effect, guess really know fall / winter. wear mask public. dont think government able tell anyone wear one. Frankly worried home anyway. Individual responsibility key. makes feel better, ordered absentee ballot arrived within week half. want screenshot winning numbers hit. also $50,000 please study published Lancet tomorrow Gotta wait things get really awful attempt stop something catastrophic. SPED students especially well also assigned staff member making sure showing online. student disappeared, phone call staff took. accountability golden. wish everyone that, far effective parent calls. remember enough intro stats class back-of-the-napkin math correctly, think less checks out.

If group 40 infected, exactly half vaccinated, would course null result. desired result see higher proportion unvaccinated people vaccinated group 40. statistics question is, much higher need confident fluke?

If sample 40 estimate proportion that, standard deviation estimate sqrt(p\*(1-p)/40). conservative, take p=0.5 maximize value, leads standard deviation 0.079.

For 95% confidence, indicates want see sample proportion 1.645 standard deviations higher null proportion. case would 0.5 + 1.645\*0.079, 63%. least 63% 26/40 infected unvaccinated, would statistically significant evidence vaccine works.

Of course \*whether\* vaccine effective different \*how\* effective is. Ideally vaccine would lot better 26/40, seem like sample 40 enough draw initial conclusions. literally opposite profit driven business thinks. e effort. Surely article Onion...

It's not?

Ok, cool cool.... Vegas Florida weekend? completely stupid. Spain banned travel Autonomic Communities, equivalent States. So, yeah... Florida dense all, what? population dense part Florida Miami. Anyone talking research done blood type relating seriously could affected COVID-19? Type blood groups give 50% higher chance severe symptoms Type blood groups give 50% lower chance severe symptoms. personal experience strain? original, mutation mutation mutation. Science isn’t really important vast majority people US right now. I’m really sure point people ages transmitting Covid-19 sending kids back school going backfire cause negative consequences. I’m sure downvoted previous comment, especially sub. seventy years ago Truman defeated Dewey, times changed.

Clinton barely leading often tied, Biden mile  Indiana live Nashville, I’ve NJ since March family. Every time think I’m going head back down, cases make push date back. I’m considering putting right early voting starts, coming back isolating 14 days (though don’t plan going anywhere polling location, road trip makes kind impossible contaminate due bathroom stops). Just...fuck!

Edit add: I’m going back vote person trust ability get absentee ballot. Sorry sure source here? Nothing BBC. They'll probably carry COVID back them. need anything else. People's words mean something. need random internet strangers interpret words. 

It must suck you. much time dedicated one stupid statement internet. wonder want stop responding. Trump lied nothing say changes words. 

I though ever find example someone healed covid one day. happens promise even call mother tell son wasting life. right least life. average time infection death reported 19 days. realistically taking 1-2 weeks record covid death. testing delays currently sure leaves things. That's October.

And again, key word ""Contracted."" 

That mean they'll done. concern though is, recent reports recovering individuals re-infected, vaccine fail provide greater 80% immunity population. 

Additionally I’m liking rushed vaccines are. I’m fast solution, causes problems road fuels certain conspiracy crowds.

I also believe could eradicated (from country least) virus applying sound epidemiological principals shutdowns.

The reason Ebola never made wasn’t meds vaccines properly applied principals standards put effect early cases prior direct evidence infection area. That’s people commenting “can’t wait!” “my body ready” for. dad really worried going outside, trying convince that, reasonable precautions, safe. spent good searching sort reputable study, contact tracing examples, etc. showed disease passing person person outdoors. best could find study done China found single outdoor transmission 7,000+ cases. recent studies? I'm talking theoretical tests aerosol spread, plumes, etc. - I'm talking actual confirmed transmissions disease, outside.

Thanks. Case counts matter much simply test positive recover. like February March everyone assumed positive case death sentence. now? since dawn print.  They'll sniffles better 1 day none changed except ""Were working it.""

No one provided source saying syringes made done October. crush Corona-Chan something. I’m going seeing anyone similar experience.... seems point daily thread ok. 5000 people Brazil, 7000 UK 3000 South Africa. think going see much UK control group going hard time infected there. Brazil hand... well 5000 people got vaccine 5000 might already results (I think 3 weeks). nobody got vaccine infected yet 20 control group, might already indication working. study likewise interesting. know bit older, that's one lowest household contact transmission rates I've seen. I've seen hovering anywhere 25-40%, 12% really really low. 

I would like note authors study specifically say ""we could determine direction transmission."" Even child ""index case,"" means first household ID'ed lab test; authors attempt measure serial interval, onset symptoms. wonder weather effect, since SK study Jan-Mar, European ones happened recently... hell wants vacation right now? Also allowed new order: private international flights charters pleasure crafts.

We’ll also take shithead rich!

Edit: it’s unclear, wealthy Americans/people anywhere still come country $$$ I'm pretty sure kids going become emancipated minors 13. They'll use excellent parenting prepared life early reasoning. :D I've never believed one moment kids highly mobile disease vectors. Also, Brazil also producing Oxford vaccine locally, European alliance placed order 400 million doses. Thankfully wait 2 three days. think it’s different it’s PCP.

Society failing we’re seeing “soft” kids bad thing. seems confusion - bad. talking ""total numbers"" I'm talking ""rate change"" ""new cases per day.""

Florida still increasing rapid rate - even seeing ravaged NY, MA, etc. (so knew easily spreads). 

I'm saying state expected 0 case overall. point know things work put place reduce rate. Florida's increasing cases per day indicates that. rather ""have done it"" (since cases would lagging indicator - possible something done recently yet reflected numbers). Yup. Well, good luck there.

Karens east Cobb. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* One problem is, people states go vacation Florida bring back state, like Kansas. early September widely available vaccine normal amount testing.

In past rushing testing less stellar results times.

I believe people Fauci knew vaccine would almost certainly developed within months outbreak getting going do. said would take year plus testing know do.

I could wrong guys study saying may hold trying return normal via vaccine normal testing done. luxury working remotely etc option me. Well, Germany masks mandatory shops, hospitals, nursing homes public transports. Moreover, mask isn’t mandatory, social distancing still followed (for instance classrooms). 

Now... open google compre curves Germany US. go. Guess less control doesn’t? 

Seems like politicising taking action it’s needed (not mask also lockdown COVID rules) seem work. Funny, uh.

On another note, using fancy words doesn’t make right. People asking make special coronavirus vaccines...

Now mother-in-law always asks bring delicious vaccines weekend tell you, kids can’t get enough! 

*short essay later*

Ingredients:

Cold virus pinch corona. start patent 500 word back story vaccine inspired grandmother's baking I’m talking book smarts.  That’s real advantage going Ivy League school. don’t even governor, Hogan best governor we’ve long time. Trump get final call decision unless made federal mask mandate

There long term studies safety side effects vaccines. Somehow cut something usually takes decade month. September, that's literally less 6 weeks away 5% net worth fine earn 50k.

So paying people wear masks now? [This NYT gives good explanation phases, vaccines where.   one help us now. must help ourselves, without leadership. Prayers positive thoughts would nice. Thank you.

The curfew applies Collins Avenue, Washington Avenue Ocean Drive. heart city’s nightlife.

Edit: Whispers:  “let’s roll” it’s far 9/11 Anniversary thinking phone call getting emotional argument people refuse wear masks. body choice lol Colorado made masks mandatory. Wish get brought states sucking time. I'm bit confused I'm sure someone answer here, wording BBC article future tense, fact impression phase 3 already well underway - particularly Brazil UK (the former go to, rate infection low here). 

There also petition signed bunch leading scientists ask ""challenge trials"" subject directly exposed virus. seems fairly contentious really allowed normally due cure. However looks like risk incredibly low right demographic - evidence suggests - vaccine effective enough. Remember Russia said thing vaccine ""people"" sub screeching top lungs? everyone cheering Oxford ""Go science!!!11"" ""muh Bill Nye"".

Seriously, can't. looked video, I'm looking diagram.

I CAN'T THIS.

I THIS.



Also things car:

It's 20+ years old, leaks bit mysterious oil, battery compartment floods scoop water it. radio, door lock locks unlock. non working LED interior lights. 

The spare tire chained trunk fool steal spare; shame you. shame me. AC.

It's best worst times life, love never sell it.

It drives like dream need cot damn new wipers. Ha, exactly. thought pandemic started. many cheaters/liars there, ‘I’m gonna go hang bar friends couple hours’ doesn’t work anymore. Yep. places. :) stay home safe get sick. family means world me. can’t make sick get sick going tourist trap. please safe don’t make others sick. “ChadOx1” definitely sounds like gamer handle would made  personally don’t like way material taught schools (which blanket statement), say, again, quote, “Who gives flying fuck education?”

Nah that’s really dumb dude 100% places daily cases already virus burn population, mostly shutdown. It’s like temporarily partially vaccinated. may back. know ive saying airborne. companies going go organizations supposed credibility like WHO. dont say airborne dont legally look ways keep people safe airborne sickness.  worldview virus? mean that? 

It’s hardly conspiracy, Japan 4800 tests today. 630,000 total. That’s outright abysmal, Australia done two million total despite fraction cases. Except good part unemployment slash income actually increase also resigned job body waxer this, asthmatic immuno compromised. quarantine two weeks getting exposed (and getting results back 12 days) employer decided give sick pay whatever reason. move away field, love put time education into, find job doing... literally idea what.

I hope well. Reminds white walkers Austin really dense city Texas even jam packed. 

The current death cases ratio way better Texas well. hopefully either gotten better testing treating since spike New York could care less, already blood hands, one bit. Money matters money blood it, bank's problem. 5 years! Even don’t shut Florida, going visit aren’t locals? 
 
I imagine *tons* people going Disney folks rural suburban areas middle America. Think Iowa, Wyoming, Nebraska, etc. 
 
Their populations naturally isolated nobody visits towns they've spared virus without altering lives way, concluding ""It's big deal."" 
 
They'll go Disney, get sick, go back home sing church choir, month two we'll hearing localized outbreaks towns nobody ever heard of. write vote next Nobel prize? NGL, pasta hot dogs one favorite meals growing (since could make it, easily), still one favorite meals adult mid-30's (since make easily.) Places US (voluntary) mask-wearing lowest also exactly places disease prevalence lowest.

Wrong. US hit hard virus many areas people wear masks hit hard. fact, politicizing mask wearing may legitimately far harm good.

Wrong again. People wearing masks protect others virus. makes Trump crying snowflakes feel wrong, that's bonus.

So provide evidences back misinformation, wear mask protect others! ""I"" reporting cases even detection rate still 1/3 would mean 30-90 new cases Berlin daily put perspective entire population Oregon packed 0.35% space.

Add South Carolina list know what’s it. It’s like voodoo see reason personally take risk experimental rat. would still wear mask, social distancing, work home anyway.

Laughing otherwise I'd packing family car getting lost deep mountain range somewhere people go/live/can't find. option to...move? Like leave FL? like easy damn wanna anywhere near FL right that'd especially true kids worry think wife became even closer! shame Florida gotten message busy fighting masks....

you would think state many retirees would take seriously Why? What’s going stop them? Lol. mean pretend to, rather unbelievable. 50% Disney+ month only! School teachers staff! promise kids cheating parents work. assignments gave district, put question google answer popped word word. obvious popular lesson many school districts used. yeah kid could well It’s produced several different factories us factory thinks 100 million year able get vaccine September administer would convinced would see come grinding halt. Since already would good amount folks immune already via getting diseases (especially hotspots people high risk partyers mostly gotten virus either recovered died. ... could honest say directly stake plead people wear cloth masks instead.

I probably tell exact moment message pushed media pushed general public. [CFR (around 22:20). mainstream media pushes mask thing happened conference.

Funny thing though, videos conference elsewhere allow comments, anti-Fauci conspiracy theorists types (come on, CFR, like nexus) saying ""if hear man suit tell buy mask, fucking buy mask put on"".

It's hilarious prevailing conspiracy way around. Rightly wary living test subjects rushed experimental vaccine/medication. history there. Especially FDA one stopped vaccine getting approved US H1N1 virus triggered autoimmune disorder thousands kids throughout Europe. !remind 2 years wife saying this. whole thing brought us closer sure. Yes it’s hard us three year old definitely stronger family six months ago. thoughts drunk drivers? Pog US bro, probably gun, love guns much country people give free shit show them! couldn’t even get quick turnaround toilet paper masks somehow people think we’re going get vaccine year. Disinfection food favorite part stuck hospital twice c diff 0 Let guess, also president doesn’t think problem? Maybe “Make shithole great again” president? ""Given nowhere South Korea really control testing contact tracing alone""

Not done well it, done suppression incredibly low levels stomping cases one time. South Korea recording 20-40 cases per day months staying extremely open. never even truly locked down. success point mostly non-lockdown social distancing measures. better clubs open US supermarkets open. huge part really government fantastic job keeping things wraps without requiring citizens lockdown, think distinct suppression, even result similar. hope y'all hit deductibles. Vaccine people saying fall whole. page always said next summer reason old friend die Sunday sniffles. F Trump Look jr. private school pud Manhattan. They’re turning hunting, bearded, outdoorsman, country bro. It’s totally ludicrous people eating up. He’s probably never even cut steak yet people thinking he’s Paul bunion beard drawn sharpie. se puede decir mejor... Wall wall old obese boomers, social distancing, masks, lots hand shaking! It’s COVID paradise. almost see Rona licking it’s little virus lips.

Edit: photo Rona preparing Trump campaign rallies. virus carried particulate matter outdoor air.

Outdoors generally preferable indoors, crowds avoided.  Keep least six feet away anyone wearing mask 12 feet away anyone isn't, sneeze travel twelve feet.

What makes virus happy humans close other. packed together people, matter much are, still exposed droplets. USA like ""Amateurs"" people keeping sped student engaged father I. school barely anything him. come bearing special gifts He's right virus disappearing... EVERYONE gets two three times die it. there'd one alive US it. He's wrong there. Funny mention, similar symptoms time point also taken swimming recently. barely swim 50 without stop catch breath, four months ago sick. 

I get antibody test.. we've pandemic half year, mask fetish already becoming popular? pretty much every parent young children tell kids sickness magnets, kids pass unwitting parents. 

Kids spit others joke

Kids talk way close face 

Kids put hands/fingers mouth provocation

Kids sneeze stratosphere without covering face (ask politely sneeze crook arm? good luck) lot chatter don’t know long good supported studies antibodies disappearing months. necessarily gonna lifetime vaccination. That’s disagree. Life short right face whatever life throws me. you’re afraid risk, need stay home. virus isn’t going away vaccine. know right? Flu shot last year 29% effective. be? going get every year? lot people still going die. could ready soon? take longer understand potential long term health effects?; Also, ""mild"" doctor speak sniffles, needing go hospital. decidedly mild, people really truly sick, know. really disappointing. LA County leader testing one-point. even converted Dodger stadium testing!! 

I think we've done great job accomplishing lone state, lone county. June able get tested county relatively easily, far far far far constraints system able schedule test. 

At point, we're going need help. Everyone is. Every state. way group states together, federal manner, sort emergency response, maybe even whole agency dedicated it. think FEMA nice ring it, maybe could call that? US government allocated 1.2 billion dollars Oxford developing this.

It would foolish Trump allow vaccine US government funded here. hear you. stock moderna, biontech astrazenica. I’ve made good amount money three, assume least one flop completely. sure long term plan biased, understand frustrations. It’s hilarious sides extreme seem think CDC corrupt others favor. Rank file state department / foreign service employees quarantined two weeks go overseas.

I wonder two VIPs got skip without tested? vaccine 100% safe.  said, specifically Oxford vaccine, using adenovirus deliver protein needed induce immune response. delivery system widely used decades. I've heard podcast herd immunity going least 60-80% coronavirus. people least wear masks well might hope...? Problem already know many people refuse wear masks. would ideal, America we're talking about. I'd willing bet going expensive. guess. open definition stupidity. bleeding stops. reason special needs son okay online husband sit help entire time. would tanked own. needs classroom getting personalized help staying engaged. okay school aide grade level work. interesting even answering argument problem infected staff, Cuomo put coronavirus patients NH claimed post.

There 14 states higher nursing home infection rates, including GA, AZ, MS LA smaller outbreaks time prepare NY.

/s gonna end going biohazard airpacks eventually created many treatment resistant bugs? knows. Since grocery store chains requiring masks see people stores wearing masks- stores go anyways. stores, notably Winn-Dixie, openly said mandate masks (so I'm avoiding like... well, plague).

On hand, went get curbside pickup restaurant saw packed patio/bar almost one mask on. Since listening anything Trump says good idea? going start shooting bleach veins drinking aquarium cleaner? 2 islands. 3rd country might well (their borders Laos Cambodia tightly controlled, since COVID northern border China also (mutually sides) Good news 7/31 $60c bought ago Aruba, Bahama, come pretty...

DONT FORGET KOKOMO INDIANA!!! many false equivalencies. Losing job /= losing life.

In fact, losing life much worse, economically speaking, someone losing job. 

It’s estimated single life worth [$8,000,000 and, know, pesky things like morals ethics, fact we’re sentencing thousands death refusing hard work shut virus. asking guess. like guess whether amateur cyclist covid - article say whether not. sudden guy 'friend friend' died suddenly, like amateur cyclist. anecdotal stories, nothing covid wasnt covid test done. yet brought story...for what? incite fear already scary virus? Reddit fucked Every country this, hate places worried violating ""freedoms"". middle pandemic, rules different matter life death. Perfect occasion karma farmers. Could post new record daily.  Maybe misunderstood things slightly, would masks work restaurant first place? need access mouth eat? restaurants running takeaways now? Death doesn’t discriminate sinners saints,
It takes takes takes 
And keep livin anyway wondering US expects first line UK/EU developed produced vaccine esp political climate. know know fact high list? Seems unlikely we’d get anything new year considering FDA logistics involved. Still want control group? even really beach, either. Outdoor transmission low. UK protests PACKED beaches cases kept dropping. opened shops pubs cases *stopped* dropping may verge going back up. 

Indoor bad. Outdoor...not ideal, okay. outbreak explodes situation China go movement restriction again, would count wave 2.

If instead count small outbreak like wave 2 would something like wave 6 China. buy 2 kid wouldnt melting. decent job keeping comfortable. 

I love 2x year it’s hot cold sleep windows open! hospitalized ""for COVID COVID"" nonsense.

If patient hospital setting, call ""active problem list."" could COVID, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism. one hospitalized with? fuckin 3.

Or let's say AIDS hospitalized PCP pneumonia. hospitalized AIDS? AIDS? pneumonia? Pneumonia? split hairs.

And Arizona swamped COVID well right now. surge COVID patients actually caused hospitals begin triaging patients less likely survive next 1-5 years due chronic conditions, send'em back door hospice. Shit's fucked time people fuckin realized it. actually read great thread case “dumb religious yokel” republicans it’s descended plantation class antebellum times meticulously planning return system via army legitimately dumb religious yokels. Source GOP suppression efforts please. Former Cheesehead I’ve lived state 13 years now. do? Ok someone tell bullshit like articles designed get hopes up. mentioned aliens. going see non mask wearing idiots tinfoil hats. PeOpLe sHiT hOle cOuNtrY sHoUlDnT TrAveL best current info I've found seems enough people gotten twice can't written false positives first infection still active.

It also seems antibodies likely last least couple months everyone vary last longer some.

Judging people seem gotten second time compared many survived, seems promising cases fluke rarity.

Of course learn more, could change. loooooove home. Especially summer TN?! Yea, I’ll stay in, thanks. Erm. What? know that's true? Maybe PEOPLE want ability make decisions themselves. corona virus going become like common cold? Meaning would forever deal like common cold? enough people choose become vaccinated reach herd immunity. people actually able vaccinated depend rest population can. otherwise healthy anti-vaxxers literally feeding rest society practically killing risk.

This right way think this, \*everyone vaccinated must vaccinated\* problem, die alone home found weeks later. Stop Panicking already. Sweden's economy shrinking interrupted supply chain failed tourism season year.

While cancer patient could simple go hospital get treatment, 50 000 rejected treatment Germany. Also country staying stopped cancer treatments. capacity already Corona low give cancer patients treatment time. likely thousands die early.

The financial crises resulted USA additional 500 000 cancer deaths people could afford treatment time. likely number reached again. forget however people essential workers- janitors, meat packing factory workers, harvesters... caring people creating even greater economic destruction. enough - don’t need keep voting ffs Well, 15 we're banned Bahamas. Healthcare workers, too. work elbow healthcare providers helping sort EMR software issues right floors staff. Yes, I've mentioning. Dhaka one of, the, densely populated cities world. something like 2-3 times dense NYC. Yet virus ravaged like NYC. feel essential workers making sure stay alive pandemic? Sadly, positive antigen (not antibody) rapid tests even included number. majority physicians know use antigen tests none cases included totals. can't imagine true case count. know choose job themselves. information get video uigher people got well paid jobs speculate forced work there. Uigher people work deserve jobs, speculations plz. unfortunately still work. honestly envy able home safe right now. would love play video games, go yard (sadly live apartment), work writing reading, spend time partner.

Different sides coin. partner don’t go eat except occasional take now. Parks, gyms, etc window. times hard us. get stay home get go out, depending perspective. Stupid comment. clear never emergency life. Must nice. Average age hospitalization also going down. lot politicization side effect election year, contentious one that. Apparently facts aren’t popular. time move He's dumb realize people color live Europe too. approved,what government it?

The government contract making large doses virus well vials, syringes, etc probably quite mid size small manufacturers many probably little exactly see graft coming play?

All companies registered business government first time year. least three companies formed days obtained contracts, NPR found.

These companies often acted ""middlemen,"" obtaining medical supplies manufacturers, China, records show. meant competing federal agencies, state governments local health systems trying buy equipment global San Diego ventilator manufacturer agreed pay $37 million January settle civil lawsuit alleging defrauded federal government illegal kickbacks suppliers, admitting months later, U.S. Department Health Human Services awarded company, ResMed, $32 million ventilators made Australia fight COVID-19. Despite track record – urgent need machines – manufacturer landed contract Ameritech's deal FEMA one two NBC News could find history federal contracting database says explicitly White House ordered — ""directed White House,"" according notes entered contracting officer.

Theres hundreds worried enough people get vaccine finally fully stamp out.

They wont Absolutley right, going popular opinion here. I'd recommend couple cut ankle monitors throw fireplace bury back yard (deeply).

No fucking way I'd sign documents agree monitor. cold dead bullet-ridden body. [Since WH blocked info going mean even trust numbers presented World Meter more?
I wondering... Surprised took long tbh...I really expected much worse US earlier, still sad regardless. exponential growth works. I'm literally looking examples. Me, looking examples, literally title post. Please, provide link one. I'm asking laboratory conditions, double-blind studies, etc. I'm asking proven examples one already found. millions confirmed cases worldwide. many countries excellent contact tracing capabilities really nail people got disease. seems really weird cases, studies, can't find examples confirmed outdoor transmissions? Honestly, it’s getting scary- virus idea long go for, average American paying price. They’re dealing many crucial ways, dragging out. Instead figuring dealing gathering data, want slow/stop testing, hide numbers *obscure* data. Covid wasn’t political trump made political. could put mask, said “we get this, I’m passing mic Dr. Fauci details”. no. actions signaling created massive divide among us.

Some people respect virus (and others) wear mask try get by. Others think either real purely political (to burn trump) acting like asinine children. used “oh, don’t agree universal healthcare abortion? Okay, difference opinion.” it’s people literally wearing mask parties pushing schools open, spreading covid around killing people. It’s unreal. it’s really dividing families. 

I pregnant laid off, locked down, looking work, needed unemployment aid ending couple weeks. There’s possibility *some* unemployment boost coming through, I’m hopeful. want open schools (free daycare working parents), reduce/end unemployment aid *force* people back work, knowing people die. sure jobs think available, though. company worked past 7 years went biz. secure profitable business.

Anyway, send chopper Los Angeles. I’m roof flare. college always like though. upper level classes, small classes debated back forth professor. feel like read original comment all. far early say sure It’s easy get sucked rage!
The media stoking non-stop. 

I tell constantly enraged doesn’t solve anything, adds stress makes life unpleasant. I’ve turn pundits, unfollow people social media keep bay, swear avoiding rage key getting sanity. 

I hope wife figures out! Nah, man. Sometimes things set motion make us 'now'. Take care wish nothing best future. complete false dichotomy refusing shut spares sort economy. Economy fucked close down. Economy fucked close down, get unfucking economy faster. What's ultimate goal though? want position Trump administration? lol  140,000 lives straw men exclude fact assholes working toward different goal good country. thing is, case, evil equal stupid. won’t re-elected. lose power. don’t see doesn’t mean it’s going happen. American lives straw men. number he's looking number tests, number unique people tested.

He's adding back positive, he's subtracting positive negative. Total unique people tested today - total unique people tested today = denominator ""people never tested before"". numerator ""never tested""--it includes people previously tested negative positive. access it. brother signed job told later. think deserve award, form medal, made like $20k worth gold.. :P Yep abticoagulation proning Every two weeks so, run engine 10 minutes go 10 minute drive nowhere particular. It'll help keep battery charged keep surfaces inside engine coated oil. Wow owner obtuse, thick headed moron. Social media warped brains ignorant people severe degree. Trump said US #1 tho. Arrange doctors get University Kentucky. Break two, six hour trips. First leg Cartersville, GA. There's Hilton Garden Inn indoor outdoor pool backs mountain behind hotel, totally relaxing peaceful. found Airbnb Lexington near downtown, decent neighborhood, $661 month: really hope so, need make sure perfectly safe think they're unintended symptom large ailment society.

I'd like say due lack education, lot is, there's perfectly rational, educated people fall conspiracy theories well. 

I'm sure fix is, even real issue is. There's lot mistrust authority vulgar skepticism. can't reach kinds people think Earth flat, think viruses exist, hope larger majority people could still fixed. 

These people trust random youtube videos cherry picked sources try keep viewpoint rather go way learn. average person time, energy, knowledge go around trying change minds. foreign language history major college. require back forth discourse really learn material. way happen effectively zoom since zoom goes messes one person talk time etc. 

So getting proper Spanish History college level education strictly online. assure you. according antibody testing around 60% people it, probably herd immunity 

That non random, 30% health care workers. 60% Bergamo it. probably like 20%, like similar places. Yeah, that’s fair enough, understand it’s hard avoid completely, obviously.

What helped me, least terms news it, assign worth, mentally, hearsay, huge amount over, stick objective facts cited reputable sources, ignore alarmist headlines, etc.

In terms affected life, yes, that’s true, daily reminders. Here, I’ve found daily routine keeps busy helped.

In case, hope gets better you! first. makes sense thanks   Happy Cake Day! 🎂  would fucking die Jesus Christ  care!

Edited add: obvious Kemp wants black folks die. ""Could"" problem. dragging ridiculous. Start permanently pulling licenses stop. Secede shithole State. OTP go fuck themselves. America family

Can’t tell poor excellent choice words duhhhhhh thing carryout exists,firstly. 

But beyond that, simply wear mask seated. Staff wears mask times. get go bathroom whatever, put mask back on. way never 6 feet someone mask (such people walking next table servers coming table). really quite simple. need to/nobody expects wear mask eating drinking, whenever seated table. AstraZeneca partner article.

But big boys it. Sanofi, Merk, Glaxokline, Pfizer, forth went day camp parents paid daycare old enough alone 2020 gift keeps giving.  love dust pepper spray indoors lol.
Good smart enough spritz it. cops dont always use kind judgement.

Ohhhh Canada. Troll obvious. catches becomes another asshole r/leopardsatemyface Testing keep up! Ohhhh think officially happen white house going fudge numbers. Everyone know saying this, novel opinion — idea perpetuates virus significant chunk abstainers risk profile goes Ha, half country already gone back don’t think middle schoolers old enough left home without childcare. Maybe responsible ones, High schoolers agree. Yes. season Worchestershire sauce first.  actually works, won’t quickest vaccine ever developed? coward man. Oh let's forget anti-vax movement intense measles outbreaks again. imagine convincing anti-vax Karen get vaccine disease even believe exists. future in-laws divorcing pandemic well. But, long time coming. I’m surprised waited long did. I’m thinking decided work home time sort affairs. H1N1 vaccine caused autoimmune disorder thousands kids europe. approved US, pushed be. pandemic making think SERIOUS global crisis comes education. mean, people graduating highschool? sick get admitted hospital Covid-19, mean minimum? Elections cannot come soon enough good tbh tf leapords face??

Only way could got sick public school. 

You really showing inner moron bro Nah really don’t wish that. Theres videos apartments Wuhan welded shut months back. Good luck finding Google though. Here's did:

I idea much drinking. much I'll say. Took number drinks took two drinks it. wife measure much take little day would get reasonable amount 4 weeks. 

So gets every morning, measures vodka day mixes gallon water juice. drink volume liquid every day, less alcohol. 

It's gotten point drive time. 

If work you, I'm sure find way around. tough right now, this. 0. 0 new cases. Money post covid hoax bullshit facebook fight store workers masks. Big surprise. day buy 'em day sell 'em, eh? Totally! bullshit saw Facebook ridiculous. left June. knew would mess Boise didn’t think would accomplish 2 months I’m familiar 2 semesters virology belt. It’s fascinating scientist brain - perfect design stealth infection. It’s perfectly designed. It’s like anesthesia mosquito tick inject don’t feel sucking blood. time notice, insect long gone. empathetic brain yet absorb even 1% terrifying is. Hey, plus side maybe future Florida, Georgia, Arkansas, Tennessee repeat poor decisions. kids. friends. one liked Forgive ignorance donut mean context? friend’s cousin still disney wedding august ?

It's annoyed lowered brow. Yes expensive pass, family typically worth it. live local DL typically spend 10 21 days WDW year. Watch video, much information article. US payed something like 1.4billion AstraZeneca secure large amount vaccine. mystery many cases relatively fewer deaths expected 

Do people even skim articles commenting? add, 15 PEN cubic meter regular price pre pandemic. mean cover expensive respirators vaccine get recommended vaccine list. used live London. living US. come on! Brits, follow America... Nothing 590 recognizeably different descendents. means trace spread occuring.

It could mean mutation changes function could occur, that's less likely.

It could also mean threat ADE greater, theory (worse clinical outcomes). Reality gotten weird, longer make snap judgements crazy BS news versus fact... mean folks pay vaccine? Seriously? something whole country gets. Lord change, get Great unclean one. use lot allergies great news too! Even covid N95 masks cost around 15 usd :( India's epidemic doubt large growth limited confirmed.

Likewise, Pakistan Bangladesh questions ascertainment much anything. That’s true, rabid base big trumps, trumps well may longer large enough win presidency. definitely way grow rabid base, obviously “normal people” base either. painfully clear. approach helping repubs.

If ever time deviate trump playbook, it’s clearly now. Yea right. September next year lucky. Distribution challenge, production. Btw. link source first sentence? I’m curious read it. virus might mutate less virulent form. Eventually people get tired restrictions (definately US) think risk worth freedoms. Think preventable diseases heart disease, type 2 diabetes, lung cancer/liver failure. preventable healthy diet exercise; smoking/drinking, yet rate obesity increasing, people still take smoking (and vaping) alcohol consumption control. virus become another annoyance ignored. 40 years dont aids vaccine. fastest ever 3 years dont worry USA surpass numbers mile Talk boss happened. grateful love even alone 🙏 COVID-19 test. every year annual flu vaccine, also idea many syringes already use every day US healthcare (it's huge amount). He's trying Make Kentucky Great Again. literally read interview yesterday March said needed save masks medical workers. That’s it’s called Floriduh. What's reason? due ease lockdown? get new job. can’t get new life. Well suggesting many cases makes even “mystery” Yup. mean testing poorer countries bad look. 

The best testing need see affluent, suburban American white people get line it. know it’s good. LoL Ah man, pregnant top all. 

Ya, indifferent towards Trump, started happening. listen talk maybe 5 minutes now, shut off. even live there. 

Well, way coming pick up, I'll tell something. diagnosed cancer twice within one year period, given 50% chance dead 1 year....21 years ago. I'd never fallen far down, think I'd ever see light again. am. I'm firm believer today there's something greater life circumstances. try, can, let mind go places might never end in....it took lot practice. Lombardy (Italy), didn’t even treat someone 65 anymore. Spain, multiple retirehomes found full death people. Belgium, Covid positive elderly sent back retirement homes &amp; admitted hospital.

Death rate lags weeks way. Today’s deaths deaths positive cases 2-3 weeks ago.

But yeah, we’ve improving ICU care sweet ICU’s full, like many places Texas &amp; Florida. saying effort (mRNA-1273) going work. saying accuse “pump dump”, saying they’re committing kind fraud science. checked group out. didn’t see Drs scientists. surprise there. eventually. daily death toll surges back levels April won’t choice.

New York went strict lock pretty quickly yet suffered ton casualties. Florida, Texas southern states breaking record case numbers refusing *anything* it.

Basic logic tells us back 2000+ dead day situation. get point option even though say won’t to.

They holding long possible since deaths yet explode along cases. always look report released decide still nervous prisons people like counties report states. example, counth state reports every 3 days. expect see large pop tomorrow counties report weekends. What... 100000 nothing 100 + 000 put together still 100. 100+000=100; that's pretty good. Walmart requires masks I've seen violations. One guy covered neck instead. Several leave nose uncovered statement Dr. Bright said “under current conditions”, doesn’t mean companies won’t/can’t ramp production. thought Perth isolated capital world, furthest capital. Didn’t Oxford University’s animal experiment fail? live northeast i've flu June before. possible. prime minister criticized lot no, Modi well aware problem tried get ahead beginning. Unfortunately either poverty, density, fatigue citizens part government lead faltering India's efforts. Oxygen used industrial purpouses. purified dangerous use instead ones used hospitals. seven day average go down? That’s account consistent weekly variation availability that's problem though it? scum American health system likely charge arse sounds pretty good.. yeah got kids, 1 going school soon, stoked that. worst time kids uhh.. sounds cool tho, good luck.. stay safe feel bad kids. really need go school actual education social interaction. starts schools back mid august like theyre planning might well dump gas bonfire. dont think safe wish brother best. Crap thing deal teachers.  - gestures broadly everything US - They’re still gonna cover shot paying go hospital Antigen, antibody. Exactly! Bring back exclusions pre-existing conditions! 

Only Covid, mess heart, lungs, brain, kidneys, really anything... survive Covid deny treatment damn near anything all! It’ll great! 

And that’s even taking account dozens millions Americans pre-existing conditions. 

What grand fucking plan be!   mask, entry. property, rules. like it? shop here. rights? right refuse service. Districts full speed ahead reopening. I’m even worried way cases rising area (not Florida Texas anything like that, still steadily increasing) there’s way stay school... would stupid dangerous... right? 🤔 chances US government stops dies access political reason? Assuming vaccine passes it’s trials approved brings distribution. don’t trust government properly help make available. I’ve recovered covid, minus sense smell taste, I’m worried getting would surely provide path back semblance normalcy life. Go r/COVID19 that’s page real information Well, I'm sure they'll blame ""libs"" company goes even state step in... 

Even oppose masks, probably could've kept mouth shut probably would've skated they're putting target back.

 really get business owners flaunt political position right open clearly bound alienate lose least customers compared said nothing stuck selling things. hope president systematically attempted often succeeded undoing many Obama's accomplishments possible undo might greatest presidential accomplishment next couple months.

Universal? things read Disney, context hints Universal. sleep study done. worst parts night oxygen hitting mid 70s short periods time. Needless say got CPAP ASAP. Regardless charge can't people make choice go non-essential things. business make choice make sure people masked. see problem know good eggs one basket, trust much vaccine compared trials personally can't wait hear it. better info usually better go /r/covid19 anyways. like... obviously scientists already thought this. Everyone's playing armchair epidemiologist listen credible sources instead spouting off. point believe Plague Inc simulation. He’s taking total new tests though, he’s taking new *persons* tested. argued yesterday. 

In May, testing opened anyone. allergies started acting up, wanted sure. went got test since throat scratchy. negative. I’ve counted “person tested.” coronavirus literally everywhere Florida, could contract tomorrow, start showing symptoms, decide need get tested again. OP’s logic, would count new positive numerator, add newly suspected case denominator already counted back March. 

The DOH *two* totals positive percentages page 2 state report. first looks lower better. That’s new positives/new tests. There’s another metric total positives/persons tested day. Personally, think looking second one. Yes counts positives already counted positive, also shows prevalent virus community want know many people currently testing positive. No, shouldn’t count toward total cases, it’s good metric seeing many people virus. 

The reason OP can’t seem find “missing negatives” can’t grasp people reason tested multiple times months. think state skews data look good, *also* think OP skews data look *worse*. Yep. Unfortunately country didn’t ... words. think ""decline"" deaths due better treatment somehow virus becoming somehow less angry. rise infections, better treatment not, increased chances deaths.

I really personally think vaccines going thing pulls us back pandemic, it'll figuring treat nearly lethal debilitating. Wait, county from? get number from?

I NJ government website says lowest number new positives county today Essex, Hunterdon, Salem 1. Which, mind you, still number celebrate considering virus' peak NJ. rate, even trump hotels resorts require masks soon. Yes, will. curious get information opinion someone educated medical field vaccine development field, provided shite. Indiana reported 927 today. Way people wearing masks folks wearing them. Florida likely Georgia likely gonna really badly. Every step along way, Governor DeSantis reaffirms commitment worst thing possible. me! Thank MUCH work do! love local pharmacists (and pharmacy techs) know husband well. large number ever evolving med combinations (chronic migraines turned intractable). get information meds pharmacist ask doctor write prescription. seem appreciate never yell ‘talk to’ them. would act like a\*\*holes people helping us? I’ve learned lot them. Always willing help figure word things insurance cover them. guys even help OTC drug choices. apocalypse definitely want pharmacist among group! True, nearly dramatically (the article drop like late 60s-70s average 33) thought Hyde Park, Chicago first make sense. also said intention wearing mask would accept fine, would ""valid"".

The British polite.  say thank fine. needed it. “ can’t get medicare. damn “illegal” don’t deserve redneck patriot american. deserve it. free loaders. unlike mmmeeeee” Disgraceful. Cops bouncers though. worked patrol (not Canada probably similar respect) simple rule trespass similar issues like this: convince talky words leave, great. nice day. comes putting hands I'm arresting something (i.e. willful wanton trespass) going get booked get court date. arrestable I'm touching (absent medical emergency fist bump). Hear! Hear! vaccine made UK, foreign country. exactly going easy spin. clarify, phase 4 testing optional study done approval release vaccine.

Various countries track reported issues vaccines primary way long term issues picked up.

i.e. USA, [The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting used

Phase 3 testing catch 1 10,000 type reactions well proving effective virus is.

Since go front line workers vulnerable first, chances much better understanding long term effects rolling general public. standard vaccines main questions would be, longevity immune response antigen-dependent enhancement become issue reinfection. statement simply ""fat fucking generalization."" data clear; white Georgians overwhelmingly vote Republican.

But, fair fair course many decent white Georgians, anywhere near majority. person hurting yourself. /s made right now. thats pathetic. Starlink can't come soon enough. wear mask everywhere Florida. give shit boonie bopers say 80, news source says 100. read it? Also care ""in charge"". moved Uighurs homeland Hubei province. world seen images video Uighurs moved ""government program"". need verification owns factory disprove it. People normally wait sitting ground bag head they're moved job site.


""We traced shipment face masks medical supply company U.S. state Georgia factory China’s Hubei Province, 100 Uighur workers sent."" really situation bad try prevent guests getting involved, keep away actual police come. think amount media access today makes massive difference. WWII, one could get daily newspaper listen radio specific times, it. maybe 2 hours max consumption per day? 

In contrast, today spend every second every day consuming news without even scratching surface. delicate balance staying informed overwhelming depressing information. viruses adapt host survive? time, adapt infect others besides already vulnerable virus. Thank you. Wherever now, hope peace. helped lot people. Thank showing kindness many didn't. it. Quit ducking areound9 Ok thanks No. meant anti-body. know antigen tests well. People dropping dead here, similar videos saw coming China pandemic first started. pre-existing conditions anything would cause drop dead working. stories family friends, seem happening really frequently. top excess pneumonia deaths, something wrong here. White House already said they’re changing data way. force hospitals weren’t reporting data CDC report numbers. Apparently, data readily available CDC agencies.

Used work NYT, anymore. indiatvnews??? seems big news. people actually start self regulate

well 90% will. People get scared ass line. We'll see people panic super markets, EMT services, &amp;c. get disrupted. 

The 10% stupid continue out. Don’t let idea lull complacency. Covid antibodies last 3-6 months reports showing. get security cameras. Herd immunity come! Careful trip bodies. forget governor Foghorn Leghorn SC. close either 😪 [Reduction Functional Exhaustion Cells Patients Coronavirus Disease 2019  emoticon looks lot like Jake Tapper didnt put even 5% much effort developing HIV vaccine SARS-COV2, spurious turdlet. HIV isnt threat global economy keep track fuck whose blood put body. sad attempt making point LOL. 

I enjoying shit HPV vaccine, 2009 H1N1 (aka swine flu) vaccine (which took less year “oh shit new virus” “here’s vaccine get life worry-free” - THANKS, OBAMA!!!)

You’re catastrophizing troglodyte push narrative holds water. Sit listen scientists. You’re qualified. I’m even qualified, know enough highlight hilariously unqualified are. They'll make 7+ billion doses first.  work.  deceptively report cases equate one one people, single person generate multiple cases.

Don’t believe challenge prove it...


I’d probably factor username decide True although knows testing like Spanish flu mean, side effects would worse covid kill you, so.... problem idiots refusing wear mask refuse vaccine continue spread even vaccines. Almost Everyone wearing masks, 80-90%are cloth masks. black market n-95 booming. Also young adults pretend nothing happened. Many saved lot money lockdown due smoking weed smoking double amount everyday. Everything risk. Kids hurt time get sick time discussion early pandemic. somebody brought firefighter gear waterproof probably durable. would probably easier sterilize firefighter's mask. novax racist?! Great news! Thing is, he’s actually working health safety states people. 

He could nothing point Georgia would better off. instead he’s fighting efforts Mayors trying good.

A state went 1000 4500 cases one day, didn’t Ms. Bottoms already test positive Covid19? wrong guy? According experts, one closed would millions dead. close there’s still long way go. approximately 4 million confirmed cases US 150k deaths (let’s pretend additional 30-40k deaths expected death count point year doesn’t exist). Let’s assume 5x number confirmed cases actually infected despite evidence number high. 150k deaths 20 million cases. let virus play everyone gets infected, would 2.2 million people die. take confirmed case count 150k died 4 million cases, 11 million die. 

How fucking stupid you? death sentence.

True range ways go bad. Something like 44% hospitalized reduced quality-of-life 3 months later.  many people going around unmasked, it’s surprise are. nmasked Florida nothing politics, parties, get toguethers, “cool” go friends. people “cool” made choice close family members, reaping rewards.

People grocery stores, businesses, even churches, tend 100% wearing masks. sure agree “everyone get Florida” opinion. contrary, expect plateu soon numbers start going down, idiots irresponsibles exposed infected soon. wonder Trump handle vaccines distribution. Prioritized governors suck dick? Prioritized friends family first? withhold together highlight spite.  okay  LOL! open, close, open, close, open, close people suggesting. end? 5+ years vaccine fully available tested, actually used 50% population?

Or people actually believe virus contagious flu actually 'go away'? Winning I'm disagreeing there. limitations staying safe limited. it’s kid it’s different.... I’m willing risk daughters health even though preexisting conditions backlog results get longer longer longer longer....

can't positivity rate go delay instead prioritizing! r/Masks4All supposed subreddit existed like month everyone complied like Asia Czech Republic did. Never would seen needing still exist coming. watched video. rather continuing written article, lets go detail video prove point:

You mean like part says exporting company Hubei province called Medwell Medical Products denies Uighurs working factory even though tracked Uighurs transferred, even though state media stated Uighurs make 25% workforce? clearly see segragated living quarters Uighurs facility?

The video also states provinces quotas receive subsidies amount workers transferred them. video provides images subsidy documents. quotas number need transferred, Uighurs penalized taking work. 

All video. exactly telling watch video would changed mind?

Edit: starting realize seeing video two different viewpoints, possibly. me, listening journalist deliver research narrative. believe may garnering information state run ticker Chinese bottom feeds journalist uses order visualize dialogue. phases mean? Whoa! quick search found disturbing articles. I'll research more. Thankfully, NY high CFR got hit early barely testing. IFR estimates 0.5%-1.0%. Still bad, course, nearly bad 8%. seems really weird cases, studies, can't find examples confirmed outdoor transmissions?

The closest think would agricultural workers getting COVID.

The reason find confirmed report outdoor transmission (besides outdoor parties gatherings) modern people spend anywhere 60% - 95% days indoors, nigh impossible confirmed reports outdoor transmission could easily gotten COVID 60% - 95% time indoors grocery store, home, work, friend relative's house, restaurant, public restroom, etc. Listen troll, answer. Pay me! I’ve wondered too. think entire world came together, united, could “starved” virus. get R0 (reproductive rate) 1 set amount time.

So effect no, theoretically possible evolved world/species. Hear, hear! pharmacy techs interact couple hundred patients per day. Vaccinating high priority well. r/Masks4All supposed subreddit existed like month everyone complied like Asia Czech Republic did. Never would seen needing still exist coming. guys take over. I'm sorry. hope --- forget -- remember less vividly time goes by.  Can't speak Brazil, Florida definitely maxed crazy idiots already. Yeah, figure average covid deaths would theoretically average similar dollar amount per life. guess also argue coronavirus deaths skew towards already retired toward essential workers (e.g. grocery store workers) would *economically* worth less. putting money value life probably best thing first place. I'd willing bet even factors considered, opening economy puts us much worse position long run Covid household absolutely mean least one death. Stop scaring her.  im amerimutt!!!

hhahahahahahh!!!! mean vast, vast majority coronavirus cases young people asymptomatic. It’s rare see infection progress significant morbidity. No, many hospitalized three weeks in. you’re two weeks test would shown symptoms now. chance asymptomatic, you’re probably contagious anymore. is. I’ll post minute. I’ll overlay testing, something already mentioned honest.

Also, correlation increased deaths increased cases point. Something else mentioned honest.

But yeah, hold case data.

Edit: Cases tests time. funny watch OP delete response run like scared puppy real data gives slap. Deaths certainly get levels seen simple fact elderly vulnerable population better protected much better understanding treatments COVID now. vaccine likely two months away. Remember movie Jaws police chief Brody tells mayor close beach mayor says ‘no’ everyone movie theatre exclaimed, “That mayor terrible person”? energetic children working childcare EXHAUSTING. Even TV isn’t interesting kid 8 hours day. It’s impossible keep entertained limited time budget options. mystery. shut down, great, opened people lost minds wearing masks safe. lot populated America, yes. Much northeast still things closed severely restricted started 4 months ago. We’re ready rumble remember, cities Philippines also contenders densest title. numbers definitely something keep eye on, least seems Duterte taking pandemic seriously. ending ICU count emergency? Cuz yeah, I’ve emergencies probably I'll eat hat ready timetable they're talking  It’s likely moved lungs. 
If would done lung biopsy would popped positive  Yankee Stay Home bunch people pretend tough, anti-mask protesters really biggest group whiny, delicate, thin-skinned babies there.

Suck princesses, put fucking masks! Yeah. know someone whose brother spent two months hospital thought brother going die whose mother mildly teenage kid friend died it. Let make clear that's one person connected three cases it.

He'll admit real. (Which progress. Three months ago said mistaken flu diagnosis.) still thinks extent exaggerated situation bad. may much consolation goes. vicious allergies life. Severe asthma kid morphed, god knows why, around age 25 violent sneezes. attacks huge ding life, violent hard control.

Then, year ago, started go away. menopause 20 years finally seeing side. idea happening wonderful.

I also stopped eating ton wheat based food may something well. think big part problem police sheriffs also covid deniers wearing masks. enforce laws breaking. need oxygen dependent hospital. (Am nurse) 

Covid positive room air? You’re going home

Covid positive need oxygen (even it’s 2L) help? You’re getting admitted. 

If require less 4L, you’re going Regular med surg floor precautions place.

If require 4L covid unit that’s right across icu

The minute require bipap, you’re going icu.

Edit:
Am Florida. Good. I'm US. blame country banning us right now. 

In US, we've banned travel people far less. 

I hope get point truly want care ourselves. then, I'll support country looking statistics science wanting go there. People gather Hyde Park listen crazies literal soap boxes. friends AZ. Apparently Trump visited things went seriously downhill that. think we’ll start seeing lot less obsession attribution, death numbers get point it’s hard argue COVID reason.

It’s another way Trump Administration run face first reality. Wet backs completely selfish point view take account effects getting covid along probability getting covid vs side effects vaccine certainty getting vaccine. vaccine enormously less risky disease worth taking.

And that, course, standard judged trials. I'm getting soon enough doses go around warrant us low risk people getting it.. Though Division man made strain small pox, almost 100% death rate. really similar. I'm sorry man. kind business in? Wish best speedy recovery wife! &lt;3 mean there's hope life ever getting back normal? Unfortunately, speculative study patients. I've already lost several people it.

I want stop worrying next time friend coughs phone next news get they're hospital. india probably best Healthcare system world, testing stepped up. hospital work delivers results within 24 hours max 48 hours there's much load. forget us Texas also going die Better understand exactly going premature celebration. truth know vaccine long-term effectiveness long-term clinical trials, literally impossible virus existed 6-7 months. research phase immense head start 15 years SARS research protein folding contributed massively understanding coronaviruses pandemic even started. super lucky 150+ vaccines development multiple clinical trials already going phase III half year in, even though still long time wait, hard work mostly done preventative care treatments help infected/recovering patients likely become primary focus virus research going 2021, could much immediate impact public health. Oh governor said wouldn’t close gyms “fit people healthy”? Yea... Florida fucking embarrassment we’re “lucky” falls back behind Cancer Heart Disease bit, though spikes happening across South it’ll probably retake “lead” anyway. 

So worst, it’s... third leading cause month first month before. actual flu nowhere near levels. 

Is enough difference call “just flu?” Yeah, non-American, knowledge Trumpese sadly limited. believe provide financial assistance. 

Why delusional research believing experts say millions people die US goes unchecked? actual evidence prove otherwise? shit, psychologist proven quite easily convince people mentally ill, much harder convince people opposite system. November third flush turd. Safe long? vaccine seasonal? time tell. Exactly. really funny Chinese forced learn English primary school middle school, even University, never see one report says China force students learn English. keep telling that. state three months ago told gov record anything. week ago started recording small small yous see nebraska numbers bullshit. triple number. videos recorded censored seeing happen country. yet filmed. keep wondering many saw happening China, feel like people started seeing happen less would anti maskers.. maybe not. Bioterrorism covered ADA, threat exception. People actually can't wear masks medical reasons business kind person shopping right according ADA. Agreed. know better best treat disease start this. It’ll help get ICU bed. sorry entirely agree you

Just like 9-11 always truthers, Plandemic would always successful amongst certain subset people regardless whether leadership divisive united. see graph it? Shut good then. Tyrants like guy trying prevent mayors free speech? strange blue print dealing virus clear months success places like Taiwan, Vietnam, New Zealand yet people power continually think best way deal least amount work possible. almost enough tinfoil hat wonder ""novel"" virus oops way biowarfare lab.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* stopped doomscrolling finished quilt today! Serious question let make clear - kids vaccinated, believe science, wear mask, think people don’t idiots etc. 


I’m little nervous vaccine seemingly rushed testing - kind safety mechanisms there? Aren’t usually long term studies done side effects? concerned side effects this? kids cold like last week. got tested came back negative. 

If curious it. Go get antibody test done confirm.

I excruciating headache’s 6 days straight body pains coughs runny nose. covid. Hell yeah! Psychologist here. front line, trying keep people sane healthy background! Fun fact: first european settlers Florida died disease.

American missing days president least two brain cells rub together? mean Bush Jr. least three. SS never danger running money. They're happier 6 trillion dollar handout got. states ordering vaccines- federal government already acquired purchasing rights 300 million doses Oxford vaccine part $1.2B deal AstraZeneca.

That's like 10 days away happening. China also using Han labor, labors every ethnicity, where's outrage? high five you!

Social distancing allow that.


I'll give two finger guns tho! Bloomberg also excellent article progress Oxford team development partnership AstraZeneca last week. Really encouraging read give lot confidence work basis technology they’re using.

[Bloomberg article Newsom blew reopening permitting weenie reopen soon &amp; quickly. state's deeply debt before, Newsom try harder finance longer shutdown? where's good news tag ~4 million Americans died 2019

So 2020 may see ~6% increase total deaths.

At least school shootings down. wife said son won’t get it. don’t care regard, that’s fault. I’m absolutely 100% taking Son get vaccine ASAP, wants divorce it. 

Hopefully people attitude. learn 5 years gives incurable cancer. Rushed trials help one.  Dumb question: saying US broke record new cases specifically discovered Sunday, US broke record new cases general happens Sunday? I’m fairly certain we’ve already days number new cases 70k+ parents used excuse vacationing abroad okay... could persuade to. No, group mainly composed Bengalis, least that's happened Rome, several restaurants Bengali cooks waiters work temporarily closed safety reasons. What, Brazil, Russia...???   Damned do, damned don't. 

The majority N95s circulation February/March cleared medical use (a.k.a. FDA certified), buy time administration could push ""emergency use authorization"" allow used healthcare settings. Imagine suggested everyone wear masks majority US supply purchased private citizens, leaving healthcare workers front lines none?

To me, mistake overestimating American people assuming would follow *many* pro-mask guidances since (rather clinging inconsistent early messaging twisted, inane vindication wearing one now).  Yes that’s true live California HEALTHCARE 3 days get sick time (paid) love liberal state realizes don’t really want someone sick coming work might feel need $$ Opening schools would possible hadn’t fucked rest reopening.

I'm also 40 I've always shape incredibly active, smoke marijuana 3-4 times week. 

Whatever March caused lingering effects me. Hope things work you. crazy virus seems affect people differently. beginning. We're watching train wreck slow speed. guess could things:

- Reporting patterns. Perhaps certain cases processed Monday work week starts.

- Persistence. fact old people regularly survive Christmas die January stubbornly want live holidays. Perhaps something similar play wanting make alive weekend?

- Refusal go hospital? Maybe people try hold weekends waiting see feel better meaning die home reported COVID deaths... compared work week need reason miss work therefore decide go to, die, hospital.  Wow seriously made comment saying exact thing, sorting new first comment see. agree completely, would personally much rather get drug help weaken virus (like DayQuil/niquil equivalent) take early vaccine. I'm federal employee absolutely option. 

Despite working Virginia, statewide mask mandate inside buildings, regional office director says mandate masks inside office that's OK federal supremacy. quipped wear one Kroger, work. 

Next day Kroger changed policy, guess didn't?  talking points couple weeks date. really think two weeks lost due Hubei government would made difference?

The two weeks initial spread occurring? went 27 cases unknown pneumonia pandemic? 

Yes, yes do. hate say thought isn’t realm lunacy. “It’s untested! Florida won’t autistic children!! What’s next, MMR polio vaccines??” Natural selection carries on... 

Sad thing idiots take part brights them...  podcast? need new one listen to. Thanks lot. stands Chimpanzee Adenovirus Oxford Unfortunately, think India going overtake US Brazil soon. Look India's curve Worldometers. exponential function doubling time around 3-4 weeks. even hint slow down. India's deaths 600s per day. Double that, #1. may happen mid-August earlier. Meanwhile, cases deaths apparently falling India's neighbors Pakistan Bangladesh. Whatever doing, seem succeeding stanching flow new cases, whereas India not. Pakistan still leads India deaths per million people outbreak earlier, India track pass Pakistan metric soon. OH! antibodies Covid-19 protect (for least awhile)?

Everyone saying Fauci God, fucking forget ""lie everyone masks help instead upfront fct needed sve medical-grade masks medical workers exposure's much more"" train March.

Lying costs trust. America. Gonna funny demand it.. need vaccine ""hoax""? fair people US able get going politicians professional athletes, like early testing. rest us likely pay $1000+ covered insurance Hero would confidence executives weren’t dumping shares like crazy. One directors sold every share held. despite whatever press releases saying folks work seem aggressive cashing hype. One thing note New York Lombardy able massively reduce spread infection populations initial widespread infection. quality reexposure contributing enhanced convalescent, chronic, serial secondary pathology, longitudinal epidemiological data places might reveal correlation. 

I would say that, absolutely observing longitudinal epidemiological data places, also pay close attention Sweden, Los Angeles, Brazil communities seen sustained rates significant spread populations order monitor relationship potential reexposure pathology among populations time. Bermuda. thing places aren’t US states ridiculously control aren’t asking people stay “house arrest.” They’re simply asking people hang smaller groups, stay physically distant, wear mask, hang outside instead indoors. 

But guess that’s much ask people. That’s bad measurement it’s possible run blood o2 low  loop; i’ve seeing reports last week florida, huge uptick sudden? Fuck, curve purely exponential happens phase 3 trial failure? make new vaccine restart beginning phases 1 2 again? I'm anti-vaxxer means, really safe vaccine given public early considering may possible side-effects injecting may visible years come know yet? know there's way scientists predict kind thing, definitely want get back normal life soon safe possible, feel like would safer wait see else happens taking vaccine take first released. Yes, course odds lower outside. I'm trying find actual data would tell us much lower. 10x safer outdoors? 100x? Chinese study linked, 1 7,000. That's basically saying happen. dad, sort thing influence public policy too. people need wear masks exercising outdoors risk incredibly small pointless? hiking trails beaches open closed? etc. would nice local describe us precautions looking now. graph quite scary, cases speeding even slower days testing. Florida Man remember Fauci saying would happy something 70% effective numbers climbing?  things change ""We've found cure humankind"" ""I'm alright Jack""? Facts live by. family them. need tweak fit. taking side say live USA? active Pittsburgh subreddit, likes British sports make Brit. read lot reddit comments years, armchair psychologist guess lot people unrealistic expectations relationships. think previous efforts large ones time. Here's nice summary: teams working lot different vaccines. honestly optimistic don’t think next years going filled violence unrest. Countries already fighting supplies get worse.

Oh, agree. think pandemic. easily find data SETRAC (for entire county) TMC  Well, agree. I'm saying it'll super obvious basically everyone bullshit take credit this. five people who's opinions think today? desperately need ľ ï f è Money matters, contribution. mean spouse worth concerned Benjamins else partner brings table. Women thousands years socialization this. Men, much. 

Speaking generally, (not specific individual), woman contributing financially typically attempt make cleaning, cooking, caring children (if any) running errands. man may attempt while, can't find paying work quickly he'll often become depressed stop contributing altogether. 

Clinical depression joke, US, getting appropriate treatment hard. Depression sort beast robs one energy needed defeat it, help unemployed usually means insurance, limits one's mental health options.

Once again, generalizing, know everyone world, speak average situation. Exceptions abound.  79% reduction patients needing ventilation, twice likely recover, hospital stays reduced 9 6 days

needs published peer reviewed studies needed, massive, hopefully first two bits good covid treatment news released today ( Oxford vaccine results published Lancet today) Governor DeSantis probably biggest fucking failure governor I’ve ever seen. Everything should’ve done, he’s done opposite. I’m damn glad he’s governor. mean, looking rolling 7-day average worldometers looks like new cases per day declining steadily week. possible they’re already past peak new cases? argument people test positive convince sick enough go hospital, hence filling hospitals people don’t need there. Ridiculous know. worked pharmacy last year gotta say, **lot** people pay flu shot, it’s expensive seniors. Even shingles vaccine. get taxes America useless fucking military costs trillion dollars year tax breaks corporations. Imagine used taxes useful services. posts like intentional, make someone feel hopeless. give in, straight astroturfing I’m totally down, I’d like ask keep one thing mind.

What US shuts August, millions don’t die. say “See? wasn’t big deal! should’ve never shut down!” don’t shut down, fucking miracle vaccine mass produced distributed October. say “See? wasn’t big deal! should’ve never shut down!”

The great thing taking precautionary measures you’ll never see doomsday outcome. There’s certainly chance I’m wrong half world infected. don’t know chances (or experts) wrong are, take precautionary measures. thing guarantee, though, don’t take precautionary measures I’m right, well somewhere 2 11 million people die America alone. That’s risk assessment about. experts need lot confidence either direction IFs say don’t need take precautions.

The way proven correct don’t shut millions die across world. way proven correct millions die. case America shuts millions don’t die, we’ll never know right. fuck me, hope don’t get proven right. [Get American, good.

Everybody keeps saying inflated, acually still downplayed, washington ton extra flu/pnemonia deaths well Ok, ELi5 - get infection rates going up... actual death rates? eveyone gets infected one dies... whats concern? 
If infection rates people ALSO dying, ok, get that. Im seeing CV19 death rate tracker, rate deaths actually decreasing despite rate infection increasing. 

So please, i'm stupid. im genuinley interested figuring wheat chaff. fun fact: Florida #4 world infections. European country   “Magic conch shell, close state”

“No” everything political thing defining identity. I've read development pandemic couple years already kinda there. entire world effected funding roof Florida close again... time gonna close people refuse leave houses neighbors start dropping dead. paying EVERYTHING? Cause talking social taxes, land tax, etc. assuming accurate data reported provided public. point, little faith 3 things happening accuracy.  Banggood also low low. like everything Chinizium nothing guaranteed. hate people burning passion. dollars cents ignoring cost dead sick people, economy won’t thrive half population afraid go spend money reasonable fear illness death. worst part there’s mounting evidence 1) people minor cases asymptomatics don’t retain antibodies long time (we’re seeing 3 months cases) 2) doctors got sick pronounced cases gotten sick again. It’s simple gaining herd immunity - may never Who’s going take plague ridden American immigrants point?  better way keep Republican party power say white lower income people deserve help they're white? like gone 20+ years people figured yet. 

The politics resentment caused ""progressive"" (I use word loosely, deserve associated Teddy Roosevelt) identity-politics racism keeps Republican party power preventing working class unity transcends racial lines. starts active exclusion actions.

edit: disbelieve me, please spend 10 minutes video ; rural voters among fastest group leaving president's side right now. swayed. white. leaving political tent, guaranteeing election Republicans vile language like ""hillbillies"" ""rednecks"" dogwhistle racism white people. slur ""Karen,"" although affluent people shop Target need less protection. Racists gonna racist named ""**Hospital ICU Beds Census Staffed Availability Reported ESS""** seems like staffed part already included. 

 lot people got bug think covid either assume immunity bug bad. NJ half cases believed covid negative, know personally one cases. lost sense smell/taste, difficulty breathing, whole thing mild moderate case, tests negative.

I agree, covid want find out. Even was, sick damn near month would rather experience again; especially since guarantee long term immunity covid. anything long term immunity unlikely anyways given coronavirus immunity typically lasts months year. 

We need either seriously lock stop covid tracks use contract tracers areas flare up, need damn vaccine. Preferably both. father taketh, father giveth. 

That absolutely insane. double-dipping? wow. RNA based virus, true. know specifics though. ’member OP similar situation. Effective tax rate around 9%. state tax. lived US would take home around 87k. 22k per year more. It’s strange. Pools, outside play equipment gardening supplies also short while. People preparing summer home. Right it’s canning supplies everyone wonders garden produce haha Depends live. higher average pay work area. starting wage depending skill people hire earn much that. crazy mean many things inconvenient every day lol society would collapse didnt. guys keep electing klansmen? going close either way. people dying streets one gonna want leave homes Exactly feel France. 

In fact, Canada dream country - anglo-saxon mindset like: working, playing, etc. different Latin way bit laid-back haha! 

If mum cancer US small business (they rent holiday home 30 weeks year, making peanuts), we'd debt right try save life. normal? people understand universal healthcare evil, actually saves people's lives.

Then remember Americans % population protesting guns use masks also save lives, makes sense... Yeah, title makes seem worse actually might be. expect details incident April, like symptoms shown emerged. reads like ad company, link study, never heard news outlet.

The news sounds good, would take heavy dose salt.

Edit: Thanks comments Sky large news source. Admittedly, American looked source deriding it. two points still stand. seeing vaccines produce antibodies people confirmed infected, no, that's true. Anybody got better sources OPs? true available mainstream news sites. always count America right thing exhausted options... Mexico too. Except... Exponential growth R0 greater 1. Also... people may lose immunity time, so... repeat infections. Walmart enforcing mask wearing finally. sad state federal governments let us corporations taking action. illegals..... count cases like many deaths? Malaysia detected new cluster involving old folks home Johor. 11 new cases reported there. index victim involved man, aged 72, diagnosed COVID-19 July 10 died week later  Half time put mask gets folded end inhaling outside facing part mask nostrils I'm dead yet

But anywho, scientists demonstrate Covid cultured viral medium seven day old mask (NOT RNA detection, usually ends detecting bits dead virus) I'll worry. I’m ready over. mental health went gutter away friends. Unless DeSantis resigns lockdowns Florida.

I fear daily infection number reach 20000 per day Florida. Fingers crossed! need now, they’ve nearly peaked. deep, bro. see “with covid vs covid” narrative going around Facebook weekend.

If want data, provide we’ll go ... anti-vaccine. all. said, given work home that, think let vaccine get used little line it. slightly concerned rapid pace developing this. Damned do, damned don't, right? spread protest negligible, zero. fact. None said political

You said one type protest spread virus another type protest agree politically not. entire premise political. obviously anyone reading thread. Agreed. yuge difference intellect immorality. full both.  Edit 476: lol thx poop award lol thx lol really expecting get poop award order is:

* 0.1%

* 1%

* Politicians

* Multi-millionaires

* Doctors

* Nurses

* Elderly

* Everyone else get hit data without tying account it. Wake up. normally wear mask self isolate. bet I'll get infected die faster majority practice social distancing. That's life. Good people always dies first. ~~Happiest~~ crappiest place *Earth* Almost certainly 200k plus. can’t even smell anything wearing P100 mask. Whenever take off, everything around announced instantly lots smell.

Pretty sure it’s blocking virus-laden aerosols along smells. without completely cutting life

no one suggested able different views issues

living someone take pandemic seriously goes beyond ""pro quarantine &amp; masks"" contradicts pro ""protests"".

Only black white world Sad think vaccine fight ignorant people, rather virus itself.  pandemic guarantee roles change - probably one watched, running angrily crazily doomers like can't find way adapt living society Libraries even open! schools be. Makes sense. Lol, Cuba history medical advances, great healthcare, excellent disease response. Cuba sent doctors Italy early pandemic help, send doctors world fact. lowest rate malaria transmission among neighboring countries, they've developed great HIV cancer treatments. mean banged, specifically behind? listed here: 

There appear two recalled adverse effects list, I’m reading correctly. association developing GBS following 1976 flu vaccine.

Mount Sinai Hospital recently completed [a study 19,860 found 90% patients antibody levels remained stable three months monitored study. vast majority people get vaccinated 90% retain long term immunity achieve enough population immunity levels prevent spread. That’s anecdotal means Got mine April.  Okay logic you’re good Major League Baseball game hosting 20k people? Doubt it. Get tribal ideology blinds bias front eyes. New Jersey different story... know that, thanks update. biden wins Republicans absolutely blame deaths ask sooner. know like Obama 2008 recession.  MUCH terrible crap happening. catch pretty wide net find stories, it’s google. people best health, obesity crisis wouldn’t exist either #YES Sometimes realistic. Something many seem afraid Tulare County tax revenues supporting fat salaries benefits earned many employed County. Go onto Transparent California website look head public health official Tulare County, Karen Haught, earns. deserve pay given mess Tulare County now? website look pay public sector employees. Heh. Yep, well said. tend get angry another patients DIES, paperwork. send CONDOLENCE CARD grieving family! 

Excuse rant, I've got let out:

What fuck people think downplaying someone else's illness death?! know millions people living US age underlying conditions surely write death sentence combined COV19? *idea* many folks risk?! want downplay flu. People fucking dying politicians play patty-cake offices, saying ""we want frighten away tourists"", ""It just...go away!"" 

Have heard COVID cough? lovely. sound death. I'M SICK IT.  That's absolutely true. Many valved masks filter push air downward cloth masks, scarves, homemade, etc. nitpicking point. masks valve, cover surgical mask, dangerous media trying make seem since many homemade higenic mask solutions. studies material differences calculating droplet propulsion seen done valved masks, would interesting. curiosity, “a couple debts” entail?  Yea mean I’ve heard antibody tests coming soon likely used heavily elderly. tests lowered Ebolas mortality rate 75% 25%. think they’ll try give elderly first, hospital workers course. school required us learn school instead online I'd totally part covid tag gonna lie co-worker Chicago office family went Vegas Florida last weekend. Unbelievable. don’t get either. obviously wrong side issue... shows Republicans don’t political savvy executive acumen , thing know appeal white male fake grievances. Please love God let true!!!

I want horrible moment history OVER!!!!!!!!!!!! data many “for Covid” vs “with Covid”.

Saw data early Arizona hospitals situation look nearly bleak it’s portrayed. Yes, increase Covid patients, isn’t primary source overcrowding. They’re basically seeing 4 months delayed procedures packed last month.

This needs lesson states: reopen bars restaurants, first encourage people delaying medical care come appointments. Wait weeks, proceed reopening. supervisor done this. beforetimes. Obviously feverish. I'm Mom. tell. Moderna vaccine stimulates CD4 T-cells CD8 T-cells. ""Killer"" T-Cells CD8 ones time. Though saying type one set things bad description, they're obviously descended evolutionary ""T-Cell"". describe, CD4 identification oriented CD8 destruction oriented.

Most survivors good CD8 response, Moderna vaccine matches that, better responses category survivors (probably lack viral anti-immune protein interference). Oxford vaccine good CD8 response, producing response BETTER survivors, would extraordinarily good sign. Might function using actual virus rather mRNA capsule. kid's jr high also implemented that. kid wanted work though. I'm sure wanted something little bit normal beginning pandemic everything crazy. soothed him.


It's still crazy. what's worse, we're getting used now. Yeah, sole mission kill many people possible. Viruses care feelings. Regardless I’m going duty vote thread people skim titles don’t get misinformed. Nobody get excited sadly; data back efficacy (and certain extent, side effects broader population) know successful counter pandemic. news suggesting *natural* immunity short lived basically, check back early next year. hearse always wins Im pretty sure would know sick I’m not. Muh freedom key available. in, might ready September state viable vaccine. mean vaccine widely available ready administer everyone. Think telling public promising prototype product. September, might position tell everyone product ready everyone year now. 2021... !remindme 2 years would hotter american flag speedo Healthy citizens, healthy economy.  It’s crazy us somehow dispute. I’m sorry, information simply inaccurate. research sars vaccine... worked decade abandoned. disease immune mediated, increased risk ards believe cytokine storm, leading worse outcome vaccinated. know anyone wants hear, something must considered.

You honestly optimistic don’t think next years going filled violence unrest. Countries already fighting supplies get worse. Eh like working home see people. want everyone else safe personally I'm rush. Horrifically selfish, know.

I business collapsed. given PPP loan, ""ran money"". damage already done (unless catch it... thus I'm fully quarantined). work Big Corp I'm bitter. time trump take credit pushing scientists via operation warp speed. Ahhh election season. People dont think shutdowns coming Florida, Texas places delusional. ignore long one start seeing 300, 400 deaths day limited hospital capacity trauma victims choice. 

I understand Desantis seemingly care health citizens really chickens come home roost major way weeks time. weep residents Florida. Absolutely embarrassing Garcetti: Oh noes, opened early! 

Also Garcetti: Let's wait enforce another stay-at-home order. 

He's worthless, like Cuomo DeSantis. think vaccine significantly delayed unable produce syringes, primary global concern.... well absolute idiot. Like stupid almost funny. would amazing. I'm sick pandemic. Journalists need paychecks.

Use fake email address. morbid unfortunately think prime example HIPAA hurting American peoples' ability understand severity pandemic.

It complete violation HIPAA take photos/videos patients release medical information without patient's consent. Violation cause heavy penalties including fines, jail time, loss license.

Many hospitals visitor restrictions preventing visitors seeing loved ones general public able understand debilitating illness is. kind ""out sight, mind.""

Hospitals sort tablet use allow loved ones see dying relative one last time vent hi-flow nasal cannula. many last glimpse loved one pass. soon please,lot earth still needs restored. Shut Disney World, too. Sheesh. Wear mask social distance let ride. flu vaccine effective people get flu, would get it, that's case.

I feel like effective would common knowledge. - COVID effect ""recover"", info that? course wouldn’t able to

I’m saying every single person country asshole wearing masks

I’m talking like hardcore public shaming wearing masks 

It’s obviously hypothetical don’t think people won’t wear masks would seriously keep wearing thought would ostracize them? I’ve seen mainstream media - I’ll see find link. Also Dr. John Campbell recommended February YouTube channel. don’t follow him, should.

I think low oxygen levels blood explain sudden collapses deaths we’ve seen world. freaked something it. lies shouted rooftop, here. boy covid-19 symptoms, period. lot friends getting engaged makes think really helped realize they've found right person. problem aren’t entry level jobs. mom always tells cashiering grocery store meant HS kids college kids summer break. hell supposed work jobs school session?

Also they’re entry-level positions exist doesn’t mean magically tons availabilities higher chain. fact matter people, high society let climb. supposed earn living wage hard work? doesn’t make sense. live richest country *the history mankind*. money there. society actively funnels top expense regular people. like 1 50 - 100 actual infections, then, right?

Edit: vote away pussies. Every serological survey shown we're missing 5 20x actual cases. we're testing more, kept range 5 10. hilarious can't read corruption free-press site without tying interests account. Fuck you, data-frogs. great enough needles world. Take look early mistakes preparations. syringes, vials rest bill materials - US screwed ordered late. Turns likely benefit vaccine availability can't splash faces like holy water. Florida everything backwards. Masks slow this. Lockdowns slow this. Instead open amusement parks.

Ron DeathSentence really get it. Misleading. Texas 5 days row declining new cases. 7-day going now. Navy going do? sensationalism. understanding two reasons.

1) team experience working similar vaccine already done work.
2) Due massive financial backing, already started producing vaccine en masse without knowing safe/effective. alongside human trials, would normally.

There's interesting article shot violating law. Come legally. Great true, best remain skeptical keep guard up! country. Live cheap here. Nothing much loss dead. Sure, that’s anecdotal Well make sure totally safe first. can’t endanger rich athletes like millions school children choice. confirm. can't riot. strike. They're willingly lead slaughter. terrible, even Florida likes Florida. keeping economy open instead pandering socialist free money fake solution I’m medical doctor. really dread going happen schools open back up. semester long rotation school district husband teacher. parents already send kids school sick, high fever, flu, diarrhea vomiting. parents would give kids Tylenol prior school. child rushed hospital passing frequent diarrhea school. school nurse kept trying get contact parent work. sibling admitted sick child diarrhea night home, parent still sent school. seriously doubt parents going keep kids home even COVID. hard situation around. may want double check Poland. largest party hard fascism right now. neighbors work there. getting downvoted he's wrong.

His sources say he's normal year, U.S. hospitals go 4.5 billion disposable, plastic syringes. doesn’t include syringes pharmacies doctors’ offices use flu shots. also doesn’t include retail market diabetics flush injectors hospitals use IV nation pivot utilize those, could,” Powell said. worry. Places worship immune virus. God help us.  One thing remember hospitals equal. Many smaller hospitals ICU beds. Much less, hospitals little experience caring critically ill patients. Many facilities ship acute patients normally staff outside regular, scheduled hours. 

In addition, virus spreads morr rural areas hospitals almost capacity handle patients regular day, much less doc box like er filled.

As spreads, shit show gets exponentially worse. states seeing resurgence option ship elsewhere rapidly becoming impossible. means probably go back work office dont want to. I’ll believe see it. think distribution vaccine big challenge creating it. file contest divorce hundred dollars states. (TX). That's significance everyone wearing mask mask used protect you. cough, sneeze, talk, air propelled greater froce breathing. Breathing slow pull air areas least resistance, gaps mask's seal. someone coughing open air suspended there, likely breathe due gap mask. wearing mask coughing, air passing mask gaps, thus trapped mask. We're wearing masks contain germs, shield virus. Would love see coronavirus themed VP debate Pence. Spoiler alert: would win. 10k day 10k total? Hell ya can't wait suck dick! gotta figure turn gay first.. “So refuse obey law land refusing obey God, punishment follow.” still WD’s Louisiana boatload. yes, lot aforementioned business re-model brand WD That's extremely small sample size Phase III trials. Ludicrously small. lot people going end suffering due us rushing learned safety systems designed minimize risk. hope sarcastic. Otherwise maybe explain virus surging Arizona, Florida, Texas California. It’s one thing tolerate Uncle Steve dinner four times year

But quarantine masks signals *significant* rational empathetic deficits. 

I could close anyone who’s hostile reality (and people). 

Ok two people together that, whatever. you’re normal, intelligent, decent person - someone like actual partner, yikes yikes yikes 

Protests, mean. wouldn’t go care vulnerable senior. thought risky, people wear masks, watershed moment civil rights. It’ll books (if species survives). chief medical officer Australia saying school children spreading COVID-19 due lung volume,I amazed logic 12 year old son 10 cm shorter weighs much small adults.
If ever happens medical experts better follow logic reason rather economic reasoning. Masks work kids spread diseases regardless size.
Anyone school day care aged child knows this.
The constant miss information anyone favours
M still know long term effects virus, one want find personally are. Researchers finding COVID become vascular infection well, I'm pretty sure flu normally anything similar. Lol, um, Thanks captain obvious seeing anti bodies leaving body every 3 months so. affect efficacy vaccine? mean need take vaccine every 3 months?  There's actually good reasons get vax high profile public figures first - help acceptance general public. That's major problem right now.

If Trump cared ending Covid, would first line public getting jab. actions speak sure. joke Made man People keep comparing thing society respond WWII. WWII lasted 5+ years. pandemic, hope, measly 6-9 months.

We need little patience. isn’t forever isn’t long. Nobody Sweden said lockdowns stop outbreaks. said lockdowns SUSTAINABLE approach stopping outbreaks, true. here’s people’s complete ignorance government institutions come play: FDA approves trials, they’re overseen independent review boards. Trump’s involved slightest, keep spreading distrust vaccines. You’re really helping. Gold star!

Educate ignorant ass: understand politicians get wrapped heat moment immediate political desires. would think though point Kemp would moment clarity asks hey, really demanding people use protective equipment global pandemic? really setting things people may die?

I guess I'm smart politician would multiple red flags wrong course action. US uses 4.5 billion syringes year. We're talking administering extra 6% top typically do. Seems manageable.

And that's 150 million flu vaccines given, rationing prioritizing resources extra shifts ran manufacturers.

It's huge number sure, percentage increase overall supply chain, pretty meh. needed surge 15-20%, I'd worried. this? without much issue. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've read Dr. Bright's words, honestly frustration Trump administration shit-show planning locking orders early condemnation syringe producing capabilities.  kind healthcare worker you, maintaining pandemic killed half million people worldwide hoax? mean, pretty much say exactly title says. doses start delivered likely September October. No, hard lockdown sufficient time, followed effective testing tracing.  Times: Three million people missed vital cancer screenings, tests treatment since start lockdown **experts warn deaths caused delays care exceed coronavirus casualties**.

Shit man, that's true, that's gotta suck you. heard ~30% get vaccine US. polling shows voluntary immunization would result herd immunity US. *insert fry shocked gif* put filter mine exit air. yes problem full face respirators valved masks. Good them. Must nice competent leaders Madam said /s People like continuously glossing Donald Trump's absolute criminal incompetence. absolutely side couple. think self-quarantine don’t think family put house arrest ask permission get daughter treatment.

I wonder coach wearing mask leopard prowling around waiting delicious face. reinfection -- reinfection causing disease, reinfection quickly destroyed cells -- real problem, we'd already seeing significant amount now, we're not. people suddenly strokes suffering COV19? headline means NOTHING. golden ticket stop giving shit. vaccine public access still keep masks social distancing. wife went really tough period beginning lockdown really confront issues relationship easy sweep rug busy schedules, traveling time work. though, gotten marriage strong ever been.

Looking daily change deaths... looks, dare say, incredibly optimistic? No, one working using Ebola vaccine base (yes invented Russia too). much better worse. Maybe married wrong person realize forced spend time together. shown less voter turnout favors Republicans. Thats put much effort voter suppression. It’s less scary realize that, effective vaccine, reason takes long get market due administrative bureaucracy. Yeah he'll right, year vaccine produced widely accepted. recent dumps set SEC company avoid insider trading activity. may look fishy outside they’re predetermined option triggers preset price per share levels   Every bizarre counterproductive thing Trump virus makes perfect sense assume goal infect many Americans possible. incompetence, intentional. merely incompetence, he'd occasionally something favor accident. doesn't. Stay safe buddy. Please know entire world working towards ending :) . I'd bet hundreds millions smart people working help end fucking virus nightmare People lose limbs time flu. flu mild disease, never isn’t proper review masks.

You don’t buy, super simple tutorials YouTube make masks old shirts may around. Three layers plenty make sure fits right. would kind cool could open one single comment thread subreddit see repeated point wasn’t doesn’t happen, norm. It’s 50% 25% cases outcome for. saying getting isn’t automatic death sentence advocating keeping clean, wearing masks practicing social distancing. Sounds like common sense me. you’re pushing straight fear. Good, enough tyrants thinking force people wear things want. [Their comment reminded Professor Scott Steiner Nice! finally read entire article. Sorry seemed lazy. found true. fact opposite.

Thanks, seen yet. really responsible would changed policy years ago. people beyond jmmature failing I'm willing bet never even made high school. No. Whether delay schools nothing this.

We know vaccine going usable. still Phase 3 testing, possible turn unacceptable side effects.

In addition, vaccine out, people able get months. first vaccinate medical workers, old people, people lung conditions, military, on. rest us able get months. hear you. dad particular would chance virus.

Good luck getting vaccinated ;) No, said unbased. Nah numbers apart democratic election campaign /s like China people 100% sign agreement forfeit covid ventilator. selfish. gun redundant.

Masks 100% stop infection. sort thinking killing people. need stay fuck indoors much possible actually control. **Yeah saying knowledge immunity system work, proving natural selection exist**. 

Natural selection means humans largely immune many lethal things. example parasites mess DNA, otherwise commonly found nature, messing DNA lower lifeforms everyday. 

If look bone lesions skeletons native americans died smallpox, skeletons show you, natives americans much worse cases smallpox europeans died disease. 

This happened europeans **ancestors** already generations **natural selection** processes specific virus. Generation generation, people randomly shuffled small inherited differences survives pathogen pass inherited differences children. provided europeans small inherited resistance factors. 

The ancestors native americans **not** natural selection virus, resistance it.

You understand entire immunity system created evolution. higher organisms earth descendants clumps singlecelled organisms started collaborate, forming shape intestinal tract, order disperse resources community. are; clumps cells work together disperse resources protect community cells. 

And since *ancestors* fought coronavirus before, natural selection time repopulate species individuals randomly shuffled stronger responses coronavirus. understand already. realise like prospect species depopulated repopulated nature works. virus keep weakening strong kill weak, generations would begin normalised levels immunity it. avoid prospect, find better solutions allowing virus burn species, nature humane. Bizarre? Try intentional. sure, flu mutates much faster covid, even get strain consecutive years. likely +2 years virus mutated enough immutity developed can't recognise it.

This based stuff I've read, might wrong. New Zealand level 3. 'Docking' also sounded quite dubious tbh:) Yep, that's right. There's nothing small government spending trillions bail corporations make woman's reproductive decisions. 

The mantra hammered home effectively 40 years even people know better still repeat--like did. hardly ""U-Turn"". simply clarification: ban going cruises applies *foreign* cruises.

Europe also mentioned far less coronavirus cases months ago. reason stingy regards using ICU beds coronavirus patients. 

Also hospitals North America Asia overwhelmed. news genuinely warrant Good News flair, seeing people taking action combat spread thus keep Sweden's graphs going down, figured might best searchability tag Europe.

this getting talked back to, letting disease disproportionately kills black people run course places lots black people. applied 100 years old solutions contain disease, could avoided this.

Hint, this. Look election long ago Wisconsin. closed 100 poling places higher minority areas, gave excuse find workers would work polls. mess absentee mail ballots, clear going on. 

The problem think virus gives two shits politics infect anyone. do, two kids 4 6.

Phew. Yeah—even don’t die even get sick it—kids spread germs like MF.

I’m starting get really depressed jaded. months trying right thing, many FL residents scoff it...I’m starting care anymore.

Edit/ : always forget proofread typos. colder cities get 1.5 months usable time gets way cold outside. first link appears talk infection immunity. relevant paragraph link would Professor Gilbert told the [Commons Science Technology might better result vaccine natural immunity obtained individuals recover explains vaccines different way interacting immune system. team follows people studies utilizing type technology make vaccines several years. Moreover, says still see strong immune responses. false negative rate PCR test symptomatic patient 20%.

Based figure, odds someone would 8 consecutive false negatives 0.0003%. Even assume he's somehow resistent testing outrageous 50% false negative rate test, chances getting 8 consecutive negative tests would 0.4%.

The two likely explanations (by far) A) never Covid 9th test false positive, B) suffering different infection picked Covid hospital. *possible* whole time got incredibly unlucky testing, odds astronomical. I’m sorry asked. trouble finding many things internet google gets confusing me. Maybe understand people use brake down. tryed watching YouTube vids matter I’m still learning.

The fire Marshall would like word... flatten damn curve. We've also seen studies 50% hospitalized long-term problems.

Source? Yes! work retail masks mandatory (Michigan) saw time..I always thought baffling death rate higher men? Good. hope every country follows suit administration takes seriously. us favor. work teacher next 5 month school. Funny. 

Few months back, people bashing US saying India much better job. Everyone learn India. Yeah.... give time. Every country experience exponential growth infection eventually. Can’t expect complete shutdown keeping economy intact. one works, tax revenue, layoffs. People work order eat pay bills. Can’t stop spread without vaccine. 1 yr lucky. Eventually countries eventually cave open up. 

Hope everyone prepared what’s coming next. Higher food prices, taxes, less social services, etc. rna detected doesn’t mean it’s viable...

This first time I've seen someone reddit understanding works. finding surfaces 5+ days. Researchers able get replicate. severe cases/symptoms likely admitted hospital? Absolutely shocking. I'm awe groundbreaking work. People issues american passports even live there. live Ontario turn around COVID-19 test roughly 36 hours. went testing centre without appointment. Waited 1 20 mins take test, next day got test results online. felt like longest anxiety ridden 36 hours. honestly can't imagine wait 4 5 days. Nevertheless outbreak back parts Japan again. Tokyo reported almost 300 cases day 15,000 day makes sad  Flu-rida sources back argument? scientists listen to... clear day. 8 month impressive. CDC employed almost public health measures caused spread virus rest globe got US borders.

What caused 2009 disastrous pandemic like time nature virus itself, actions CDC. 17 days here, took 7/1. $500 fine don’t wear mask earn less 50k year.

5% net worth fine earn 50k.

This solve America’s problem. -10 degree winds chills regularly around here... care wear, outside that, much learning happening. fairness though, true autocracy, think chances getting brilliant autocrats high either. Join military. You’ll get free healthcare family. Sadly... yes, are.  Fellow glasses wearer. several tricks that! Give google :) Yes fine also work ups idk wont say name lol  ""...many people say patriotic wear face mask.""  tagline: ""Vox - News already fucking know"" I'm sure, can't speak that, constant inundation ""anti-masker"" videos posts getting quite ridiculous.

Someone probably know thinks way. Ouch lmao. 
Out curiosity kind covid precautions guys living now? I’m interested hearing experience living 1st world country believes science... reddit problem bashing US letting literally everyone anyone border? Sad thing order compliance needs fear. one gov get severally ill would change minds. trump homie probably viles remdesivir stocked up. Sorry anyone's offended true.

Have lived suburbs outside(15-20 mins) KCMO life. also family Southern MO would drive visit fairly often, along summer trips Branson Silver Dollar City like(I always preferred go Worlds/Oceans Fun).

Nothing said inaccurate. hated going visit said family/going Branson. younger, admittedly, solely due stuff like ""suburban/city boy hates Hickstown USA would rather home playing video games"". got older started pay attention more, became a... ""holy fuck guy say black people? Wait, want atheists? Wait absolute fuck get here"" sort thing.

It's great. Hey man, get memo American deaths thew new currency? else think funding stock market right now. large chunk friend group hanging out, going vacations, planning go school next month. understand “can’t deal this” aspect, I’m afraid virus listening. I’m you...only go to. wealthy country modern medical care available.

To non rich. rich always available course. See millionaire players NFL, MLB NBA getting daily weekly covid testing results within hours best medical care money buy.  got tested yesterday (also Kansas), flagged ""Priority 1."" splitting test processing Quest LabCorp try speed things up. still take 5-7 business days Pri1, 8-10 business days groundlings. name some? I'd like educate subject.  politicians going push people revolution. endorsing idea, would shocked see public executions officials scenario.  stupid, keeps getting reposted.

Why? Government: Ideas good, mandatory. test unavailable en masse time? Sweet there's 4 cases 4 months country seeing 500 daily cases. really making case real problem.

And way, guy infecting people Nova Scotia, there's next chance got country guise traveling Alaska. let logic stand way xenophobia though. US bashed constantly open enough borders Godlike Reddit Dreamcountry Canada won’t let you’re 40? MLB uses pool testing since players negative. Finally. months late, smug way possible, cost tens thousands lives many severely ill.

I give credit whatsoever, knowing interest public health polling terribly. McConnell McCarthy must used coloring book morning help understand campaign sinking. WI. I'm medical procedure done maybe expedited it. US tests: 

South Carolina tests: released DHEC every day:  judge, smoke 40 cigs day? I've smoked since 13 even worst days would hit maybe 1-1.5 packs throat would raw night time. even imagine double that! I'd REALLY try lol Encourages people go back work. 

Yes lot don’t jobs, also lot refusing work since profitable easier work work. shouldn’t system it’s lucrative nothing. Hell yeah! can't live fulfilling life without Netflix, gotta check priorities. Saved $10/month right buy used book help get path pursuing dreams (first one's free). again, address anything frivolous spending took personal attack. 

Why labor worth little? believe we're arguing one reasons right now. forced work shitty job low pay money pursue something else, that's good reason. 

Your argument can't decent social life less money asinine. Find new friends they're pressuring go bar every night instead hanging out. takes little sacrifice save make less expendable. takes nothing say woe me. 

Also, want minimum wage go UBI happen, however think people smart back boat decade. Stay classy RGV. sucks see hometown make reddit bad way. people say

OK isn’t point we’re discussing. Sweden Japan killed spread without lockdowns. 

This fact. 

The question WHY.

I know gone full propaganda believe shouldn’t speak truths loud, that’s ridiculous. 

We need know places without lockdowns able practically eliminate virus. 

This needs studied. need pretend isn’t happening hopes manipulating people “do right thing”. 2 days  “Next man up”

There already teacher shortage. way things going now, highly doubt people gonna apply droves teachers get fired quit. Unless work shitty company, invest Apu... problem solved years ago. find pretty annoying wear, I've tried like 5 different masks every one leaves half-blind indoors breath fogging glasses. 

However still wear I'd rather deal little inconvenience put (and others) unnecessary risk. Robots can't get sick! good butcher mine That's good point. didnt think batches based households/social contacts. thinking randomized batches, could see method might save resources. Plus, could tell entire family quarantine soon initial test comes back positive, without waiting individual results. know American graduated college States got Master’s Spain, ended living 10 years so. live area need learn German, really, really hard. can’t go specifics (they tried explain me, couldn’t follow) expect difficult is. think they’re over-achiever probably miles better think, regardless, it’s lot work. It’s impossible, work hard it, it’s going frustrating.

Edited add: try Duolingo meantime. able learn phrases Polish chat janitorial staff work, lot fun (pre-Covid Times). ask nicely, think rest Nato could invade us take over? Ya welding part, could done without proposal force people choose UBI social program fund via VAT... nothing wealth transfer sold way help little guy. I'm form UBI, plan going funnel money upwards. know shit real Trump showing common sense. I’ll take mine extra microchips please words spine see Chinese running effective disinformation demoralization campaign.

Trump supporters ruining image. Every country stupid people, allow loud reason. months ago many scientists still face masks. takes time fool believe politics. American friend debating healthcare one biggest arguments competition private sector makes cheaper US anywhere else world went public would expensive. Literally one google search shows Americans [fork country western world exact treatments still end worst results.

I'm principles competition capitalism providing better service despite flaws, attitude I'm sure put odds pretty much Reddit pretty left overwhelming evidence applying principles healthcare work that's even bringing account ethical argument poor afford life saving treatment.

As said friend, country prides Christian, America remarkably unchristian comes helping poor needy borders. wonder Jesus would look kindly Karens screaming church tax dollars going towards helping save lives poor afford insurance premiums. Can’t stand guy, thankful worded way adoring fans would perhaps fall for. respect jpow. brings flog public stock markets going up. correct answer, keep mind ""recovered"" mean ""back previrus normal"" slightest. means immune system cleared infection - potentially even since people either relapsing getting reinfected. Many ""recovered"" people suffering crippling health issues, facing huge reductions life expectancy organs permanently damaged. feeling studies based 6 month followup appointments March's mild cases publish, may cause panic. Yea pretty much worth aboard six digit train! aboard! *CHOO!-CHOO!* Taxes. feeling Trump's going let keep happening untill November, (please god) loses, he'll try extend term saying coronavirus crisis needs handle. Im hoping im tripping. Um, No! Canadian here. actually consider points. Thank bringing sorry marginalized issues. reminds something Dr. Seuss book. one new favorites now. all, think uptick pneumonia deaths likely due undetected Covid. seems pervasive issue occurring across country. don’t think it’s fair use information conclude every state decreasing hospitalizations therefore manipulating numbers.

Surely point see sustained decreases Covid hospitalizations across country. suggesting cases states manipulating numbers?

Are saying New York doesn’t actually decrease Covid hospitalizations cases pneumonia detected Covid?  Lol

""The recipe coronavirus Hilary's deleted email server!!!!"" know reddit likes gloom doom, everywhere. Yet. people take right steps, avoid places hospital yet overwhelmed.  RNA vacccines future medicine :) would mean end Cancer, AIDS, etc :) Stupidity. don’t know. Sometimes ignorance bliss, sometimes ignorance end life. wouldn’t take gamble. Whoah Trump lets anything hasty till facts in! shit meaning lives? multiple friends stayed 7+ years Germany without speaking need get bread bakery.

Big differences job tough - office jobs (outside government/orgs smaller businesses) big corporates english communication international teams, issues there. goes universities - offer lot courses English, though all. carpenter blacksmith something else might difficult.

The problem measure never meant long term solution. idea lifeline quarantine effect COVID 19 spread could contained. government failed implement strict rules people failed follow even looses ones. left nothing shit decisions make shit situation. tested positive, without symptoms, said local health department asked sign documents would **stop traveling anywhere without calling department said chose sign documents **""if go ER, go hospital, I’m going wait get approval couple said refuse self quarantine, planned so. Exactly right. team Oxford great they’re great job this, purely scientific perspective it’s transformative achievement. certainly society reducing death, isn’t scientific breakthrough. Lmao well say think downfall US. Probably immediately anything slowly time. way hell trump would make vaccines mandatory there’s absolutely 0% chance supporters get it’s made mandatory democratic president GOP - clearly - allowing virus wash country. Oh read it. really sure random pictures random screenshots text messages reliable source alright. Yeah. largest vaccine producers world iirc. unwanted Americans seem really consider world included countries.  might. least get virus. there's difference living patients days-dead bodies? good grief. Emergency department visits still either way get cocky. Especially US. *especially* Chubby Donald wins November. think DHR hospital. even win, virus actually handled (which next election hopefully he's long gone then) he's going look like gambling addict.

""I WON! KNEW I'D RIGHT! $5,000! WINNING AMERICA""

Except think much cost win 5,000 *one time*.

Now replace dollars human lives. That's he's betting. one party looking keep check.

Fuck GOP. Sweden [gained nothing 40% higher per million death rate US. one currently pays people algebra. think understand stem degrees actually used for.  That's setting bar low. never gotten bad NY either. competent government would listened reports coming China, investigated corroborated them, taken precautions ahead time. Literally nothing done hospitals filling patients US cities. logic parent gone non-essential reason last months also lose right complain schools reopening losing free daycare children Without money, time, severely limited ability live fulfilling life. saying socialize, dont indulge entertainment, ""dont spend money shit,"" hope find hobby costs nothing! hobbies cost something. Even something like hiking requires lot time, transportation, want seriously all, expensive gear.

Maybe question labor many worth little, whybis almost zero safety net government something bad happens. Sad preventable series Medium articles mid-March/April covers pretty well: it'll around vaccine (if! ever one) ""we"" (everyone working medical field) need time figure actual best practice treating shit (which kind-of worked, people dying less used three months ago. uncover effects ... bad. Talking keeping next-door hospital ""clean"" strokes, heart attacks, ...? well, among serious issues arise surviving first weeks SARS-CoV-2 infection).

Shutting early also buys time educate ""The People"" expect, do, stay safe, slow shit down. Experience shows really start massive coordinated effort contain people, peer groups infected high risk infected soon. ""Test - Trace - Isolate"". first days/weeks needed bring infrastructure testing, figure tracing less-invasive way; Isolation pretty much straightforward thing (it's catch common flu; little strict shit).

Yes, tough - anecdote: mid-March, Germany, know much Bergamo would see, special needs nurse-friend come garden sit fireplace figure cope told local hospitals (plural!) kids care show symptoms respiratory disease, leave die ... and, due contagiousness shit, physically near provide comfort. Heck, started newspapers telling people wash hands every while. normal day work, I'm covered people's saliva least four times; I'm used keep hands clean, I'm used changing clean clothes every hour ... washing machine running 75°C cycle every f\*ckin' day.

With Test/Trace/Isolate, get total numbers (when executed properly large scale) get reasonably clear view local clusters/hotspots. ""Everyone else"" can, slowly, find way back ""normal"" keeping basic safety measures like, say, wearing mask avoiding stuff elevators.

Enter: Reproduction Rate - worst thing happen one infected person goes event passes many others (for research: Try googling ""Patient 31 South Korea"" - they've good grip first 30 cases #31 attended several events contagious...). every infected person, statistically, infects 1 person, shit spreading ... rather unintrusive measures help bringing ""less 1"", meaning epidemic slowing halt. point, ""all us"" ready adapt - times, meeting friends, times living somewhat normal life.

Right now, Europe, we're figuring live life several thousand active cases across continent (mostly slowing down. Anecdotal: county, we've 2 known cases beginning last week, family came back out-of-state journey; caught SARS-CoV-2 along way gathered family reunion 50 people return. Today, we've got 20 active cases another 135 people preventive quarantine). works widespread Test-Trace-Isolate; local CDC currently confident they've caught everyone who's reunion.

How know? I'm physical therapist, visiting lots nursing homes around ... little accident, could statistically responsible 200 people dying bringing virus nursing homes another 400-600 dead people one nursing homes situated city that's closely interwoven institution taking care people special needs. ways figuring keep people dying, people 8-in-10 chance dying anyway. quite thing want known ;) Good. Hope trials carried properly. Also, medical bodies need revamp. ICMR next useless, copying whatever CDC setting shitty deadlines vaccine like August 15 lol. Also take another recess August nothing done screwed.  dont fake death numbers. people dead question killed them. Say stroke get admitted hospital, maybe I'm little nervous temperature little elevated. maybe I'm anxiety complain shortness breath headache. may test negative bug probable case based symptoms.  day two later sedated maybe even put vent pass away. death certificate list bug. Yeah nothing 70 years old, overweight, smoker, drinker, hypertension, etc. probable bug in. know incentives care probable bug patients right? first developed nation fall developing. extent depends design life. 

Too much consumption hurts you, environment.

That's literally vaccines do.  mean wanted anyway so... waiting comment chain deleted mods political, even though COVID necessarily political one party US decided somehow politicize disease itself. two either bit click bait manipulative pump share price.

The whole incident CCTV, man well known them, police arrested soon saw footage. got 8 months jail, case went quickly. corona virus beside point. damage done poor lady know would get virus. disgusting cough spit someone anyway. 

The man young idiot either. He's 10 years pensionable age. He's probably spent half life banged he's obviously learned nothing. Definitely want loosen child. lot people country still think COVID deep state conspiracy. wonder country messed up. republicans well fall, completely fucked up. believe patients could piling up...and post evidence expand units patients piling up?

That special sauce sucking on, buddy. Yes, keep looking ELI5 post difference vaccine regular ones take ~10 years research develop. 

I didn’t read kept seeing posts like skeptical they’d able all. I’m pleasantly surprised, wow. poster replying could argue good faith put gun head.

It's whole schtick. Can’t wait see happens take little left greed. wouldn’t want politician let many people go homeless. facing eviction. never missed rent payment pandemic. I’ll getting kicked end August. People nothing lose dangerous lot! bonus? completely avoidable country strict lockdown citizens gave shit one another wore mask reopen early.
Almost every country world less 100 new cases day, U.S. +70k new cases day. don’t know they’re manipulating numbers sending patients New Mexico.

We know they’re sending patients New Mexico. natural assumption based locally available resources.

It speculation assume they’re manipulate hospitalization numbers state. want people convinced propaganda social safety nets turn us communist third world country. think wealth limited US one race special interest group live well rest go poor. Strongest survive, pull bootstraps, shit. Lord flies style capitalism.

The corporations wealthy good though, protect let run wild hopes one day jeff bezos too. won't. bunch uneducated, tribalistic shit leads poor infighting scraps wealthy get tax cuts continue accrue wealth. ok. try offend anymore. vaccines do? top that, biggest problem staff. IC nurses. short term problem, also long term one. nurse cope much.

The Netherlands kind back feet bad US, even we're seeing IC nurses quitting jobs want go feel like they're getting paid enough get GOT shame bell lady? funny. want people take shit job shit pay instead collecting unemployment that's available...in middle pandemic????

No one abusing system. unemployed entitled money. runs I'm sure people take shit job shit pay. too?

The job pay better offer better benefits can't compete roughly 15$ hour benefits job unemployment that's problem.

Especially impacts life outside work.

But... now, 4 months bills hanging head prospect job hunting middle pandemic... yeah blame people deciding hunker ride job hate dangerous. us choice... 10,000 tests per day actual numbers never known call people wear masks plague walkers. sort impossible talk people never take seriously think always joking really mean say. mean, taking seriously right now.

Ron desantis governor. see campaign ads?  “Quite common” = 24%, brings right back almost exactly percent welcome whatever want, point want people consider odds catching global pandemic already killed 600k people versus:
1) vaccine actually unsafe (very unlikely, evidenced alone fact we’re talking single vaccine wasn’t even approved US)

2) unsafe vaccine affecting (in case, less .005% chance)

If don’t want take early that’s fine, don’t represent catastrophic risk Pandemrix wasn’t fun all!  doctor already stressful. imagine load they're asked carry now. can't continue like this. going lot burnout mention get ill.  think details trumps actions seen counter productive opposed merely nothing. wearing masks could slowed progression south saved many lives much treasure trump remembered actively opposing even that. Historians additional data know whether stupidity arrogance corruption flaw trumps administration. dad one Covid skeptics yesterday saying rest us making trip Bahamas November rest us didn’t want go loss.

LOL You’re fear mongering. vast majority people, COVID isn’t big deal. biggest yeah boiiii ever Oh, choose among six different types masks wear? Thanks Coronobama. Method crisis acting. Sounds like that's gonna spread quicker Uyghur population, though surprise that's intention China win win win matter what. Got COVID mind never give up. Every time walk building everybody's masks come off. stay Personally trust probably safe still want first line exactly. Give months least see anything unexpected comes up. get country better testing capacity now. nothing else, seems like one thing could done past couple months. distance learning reasonable accommodation shown useless. Kids employees subject employer/employee relationship. Okay AREN’T banned from?
Makes total sense though Imma bet 80-90% americans dont even give shit amendments use em convenient even reasons behind em bull. US average mortality per year causes 0.7%. multiply 3 months number confirmed cases 4 million, get ~7000 deaths (and that's assuming 4000000 cases infected 3 months makes gross exaggeration). even assigning deaths everyone covid positive died cause significant grand scheme.  residents town visitors mask protect themselves, improved research shows decent fabric mask also provides roughly 40-60% (or depending material combo made from) protection wearer. 

It's reason wear flimsy homemade mask. see mask bandana...its minimal use, know virus go right light will. couldn’t imagine teaching 37 kids outside 104 degree (F) heat. get complaints many posters wall distracting students, sitting outside possibly dangerous heat isn’t? Miss that. data easy monitor.)

And understand administration forced hospitals stop reporting data CDC. think lot people forget that. That's bit harder relate spike certain event. stores unionize  Must Cowboys fan yeah people modeling sweden's population herd immunity predicted around 6k deaths hit 20'ish percent population it, posit enough herd immunity. deaths slowing almost zero, leading one assume almost herd immunity (yes, know models professionals believed needed 70% infected hit herd immunity, experts models wrong entire time seen observation since time).  suites? Almost there, google. Plot twist: classifications/types make deathly sick pain many days months. Mate take joke, one. Haha, clever, upvote ethnocentric perspective have. Yes, American's dumber box rocks, I'd say majority many wearing masks. American finance incredibly short term compared countries. things judged quarterly, annual considered long term. Compare European countries typically look farther out, like 5 years, Asian countries often value long term(decades) short term fluctuations. 

There still exceptions rule, even American somewhat shocking, somewhat understanding American businesses refusing take short term losses long term gains. remember reading researchers Gamaleya Center, developing vaccine, tried end March beginning April. center's director said time sure safety safe done mostly means protecting avoid going sick leave interrupting work. giving false positives. reporting positive cases. prior pandemic cdc guidelines dictated needed report positive cases back cdc.  since federal state government garbage. never made sure small labs updated requirements. Yeah even 2000 Ravens guard would anyone eat restaurant doesn’t give fuck safety? Even rise they're valued around 50m. preliminary results hold get emergency approval like Remdesivir, valuation shoot again.

But well, casino point, better treat like one Meanwhile parents East Cobb circulating petition get schools reopen anyway. don’t find fascinating find stupid But, can't get margheritas like Bahamas anywhere else. supposed do?! /s   want slow close bars restaurants. Make go only. night life make much worse. what? Open precautions till...a vaccine? minute get normal spike. precautions dont stop entirely. People aren’t gonna live new norm years. 

I actually favor full scale mililtary lockdown months ago evident thing already ingrained society amount asymptomatic cases have. Seems like self-correcting problem... kid's name Rowdy Rowlette. could read further. call governor DeathSentence that's is. Kidney damage meaning dialysis dependent, triggering diabetes chronic fatigue syndrome, etc. Vaccinating high-risk groups also blunt spread everyone else. guess come true all: wildly misreported.

There labs reporting positive results got, causes problems try assess positivity rate, number cases reported unaffected. Please reply this. helping. Leave alone. understand. going this.

I think leave one alone. Fear healthy response something unknown potentially deadly. Fear keeps people alive dangerous situations, inherent humans. becomes problem overwhelms faculties dominates thoughts/other concerns. 

""acting fear"" usually viewed negative thing, like...if find yourself, example, active warzone fear feel likely keep something incredibly stupid. let completely dominate though, may paralyze move. healthy important part healthy reaction, kept check. Acting like fool fear may seem good first pass, we've seen US, situation actually dangerous actually calls healthy dose fear, disastrous present. Living Florida, I've family described difference startling. Politely words significant lack masks store ""simply wild."" Honestly, wish there, too. 

I'll tell you, us flippant indifferent; us trying hole long possible attempting shit pants uncertain fear coming exponential growth governor's head far Trump's ass can't see what's happen. go out, masks one us absolutely to, stay away others, like one family's efforts significantly affect rest insane state doing. feels like we're huddling large umbrella watch tsunami rise higher us, waiting hit. every thread? hate US healthcare, get it. political story. hard time feeling bad florida. made big fucking show going open everything engage good faith practices limit viral spread. I'll stop short _saying_ florida deserves this, I'm thinking awful fucking loud... I've said before, I'll say again: I'll take dose! Well Governor telling medical examiners report numbers CDC Trump telling everyone report data CDC instead HHS, Alex Azar - former attorney lobbyist pharmaceutical industry, wonder know real numbers Florida? let atlanta want? get he's pushing hard repeal mandate. Let mayor control city.

It makes sense governor step city safe, make city less safe lol. 

I also think least metro atlanta leans left he's politically motivated, sure favors. And? I'm sure point is, plenty proven masks effective. Wear mask. everyone uses Funeral Home. people want everyone remember dead die.  That's terrible. would hate know people working around actively carrying virus could kill father. That's really visit family much right now. people think ok pass around deadly virus. think I'll die it? No. respect many others stop it? Yes.

We shut year. Here's thing. Pretending like big deal longer lasting negative impacts dealing right now. rest world dealt reopened keep getting worse. would really, uniformly shut month, we'd much better off. didn't. aren't. think better huge death toll continue spread virus alarming rates next 2 years rather hard work month get it? 

You still wont read articles go opinion huh? Got Shortly downvoted got back positive (the post here). meant delete reach maybe -50 think Edit people understand better.

Edit: know learning second language difficult, enough practice time i’ll acquire vernacular colloquialism communicate concordant matter vis-á-vis americans. struggle endeavour mastering english language, ergo, hope articulated less proper manner understand mean poor explanation. I'm well aware sounds bad that's risk involved research. could way around aswell, like hydroxychloroquine linked cases getting worse. People lucky get placebo it, sadly, way around. proper research solid evidence always control group placebos. Splash Mountain ain't joke COVID-19. Wear damn mask, chin strap. can't believe opened damn early. mean thought least gonna closed till 2021. nooo people need bars can't handle home smh. sad. realize shit hit fan February/March got ""under control"" recently due many full lockdowns lasted 2 months. Hospitals overwhelmed patients sometimes transferred countries (France 30% deadly (not sure number, I'll believe it) half time, 1/3 spent full lockdown nothing downplay.

The Euromomo website really interesting (and easy use). go see excess deaths 2017/18 compare. 

Yes full lockdowns etc., previously unknown virus, known effective treatment fast spreading going cause that. perfect response stretch death toll (compared previous years) show catastrophe sometimes presented as. cured dead Matrix.exe stops working 31.12.2020 23:59:59 least they're taking break blaming brown people. Texan checking in.

The Kroger Saginaw tons customers masks went recently. Staff told they’re allowed mention don’t want disruptions. Target Ridgmar mall, Fort Worth, teenagers purposefully coughing people thought funny. friend Arlington deal birthday party street twenty cars going one house.

Tarrant county still ways go. liberal state, knows bad really is. This, example, psoriasis. dermatologist sees psoriasis immediately says looks horrible, shouldn’t live like I’m putting taltz. insurance covers pay $5 dosage.

Long story short insurance basically says “We want try cheaper treatments first costs us much don’t want pay much” go taltz’s assistance plan pay $25 provide treatment 3 years, shots $5.5k month. headline sounds like good news story pretty fucking frightening. 35 years old, COVID nearly made orphan children. Probably straight away, vaccines difficult mass produce 'ingredients' quality control down

Of course depends living 1st world country (usa count) Yeah comment might suppressed dad used work morgue (dark stuff) says deaths almost always lage 2-3 weeks initial infection. 

Take will.

Edit: nvm saw somebody already commented . Welp  _the biggest breakthrough would honest reporting MSM, rather reporting CDC algorithm's inflated ""worst case scenario"" number commonly used epidemiology preperation device, MSM fear porn tirade_

The CDC lists website cases covid deaths literally anyone absolutely nothing Covid Labwork all, 

- _(aka cough 2 common symptoms known man, area assumed infection assumed maybe near somebody positive Covid reading [aka coughed], test required anyway)_ here's video Texas courthouse talking it, Health Department Official lays like CDC site:** (_the example used turns 1 positive case 16 due contact tracing. 15 others wholey This. Florida, shutdown joke. EVERYONE packed stores stores still enforcing masks yet! Restaurants stores still open. Parties everywhere too. People complaining younger crowds going out, ignoring rules, seen single one friends (late 20s - early 30s) going unless absolutely necessary. parents grandmother however constantly going shopping daily, going parties every weekend. call BS younger groups. I've seen nothing respect younger disrespect older. Welcome misery Zoom kids! ... mostly incorrect. Wearing masks *slow* spread disease much way running faucet slower rate drain sink ""slows"" buildup water sink.

But that's reasonable way phrase that. would say running drain rate reverses increase water sink allows empty out.

This exactly community masking does. reduced R-value (how many people infected person gives disease to) 1, means growth disease reverses. might R-value close 1 meaning infected people often give disease one person average, that's still declining rate transmission. Kroger Saginaw tons customers masks went recently. Staff told they’re allowed mention don’t want disruptions. Target Ridgmar mall teenagers purposefully coughing people thought funny. friend Arlington deal birthday party street twenty cars going one house.

Tarrant county still ways go. *sadly laughs fibromyalgia suffering*  infections reported 2 weeks behind... mean won’t see full impact July 4th weekend infections (not deaths) August?? non-peer reviews questionable 100% time. Nope, usa actually caused death wrong ventilator useage. Die quit job? There's always choice. Fear-mongering article 13-year old boy died ""after experiencing COVID-19 symptoms,"" test NEGATIVE peak disease. 

Kids die many things -- COVID-19 thing kill them. 0.04% Americans died ""with"" 0.03% Canadians died ""with"" Covid.

That's weird rounding:

Canada: 0.0234%

US: 0.0433% Personally think really crushing bit many us sacrificed much worked hard stay home wear masks effort undone bunch assholes.

I spent last 5 months inside go work plague-ridden school fall, looks like they're gonna toss wood chipper regardless Colorado made mask mandate literally three days ago. Think people would gotten infected mask mandate April. Many, many countries leave individual region/province/state make call.  six types intercourse. Necrophilia last stage. I'm bored night shift. How's weather Finland? ""We're lifeboat, America. 

Go ship.""

Yet Americans say Mexicans, countries would gasp horror yell ""That's racist!"" woman filming critical cops. direct translation basically said ""Are serious? mask?"". Later says ""3 cops take guy mask"". Last thing says ""Don't touch me"" cops says working.

The mask guy French Canadian taken French Canadian cops. visible minority resisting, peaceful. visible minority would probably resist know comes next.  certain American C-words, never got losing right people, (...many...) everything power return time. make really compelling point. I’m gonna shoot head rather live world read comments like yours

I reported comment mods. use strange pronouns, coupled self harm might indicate serious mental health issues. Please seek help immediately! forced lock violation constitution happening summer, wait till fall winter gets schools re-open. I’ve started stocking essentials now, little little, buying anything bulk - little extra. next shutdown comes, come, make first one look like vacation. countries around world celebrate Christmas loosening restrictions, US huddled inside; scared, angry, saying things like “How get bad?”

If pandemic shown anything, it’s far morons country ever thought possible. Fucking sad. Here's funny thing.. go around assuming everyone COVID, U.S. situation. Everyone's going read title take whatever want bother get piece information. Texas well. Abbott already came saying shutdown again. less important statistic death per million inhabitants. Countries small test capacity example concentrate people hospitals, deaths per number confirmed cases ratio look worse countries also able test lot less severe cases. mean hit worse countries.

And like wrote currently number cases USA rising lot. people got fatally infected last three weeks daily new cases really high, far higher April, mostly yet part death statistic. Deaths always lagging behind reported new cases takes average 3 weeks someone die coronavirus additional days death official reported becomes part statistic. LA never fully opened...and business etc closed again. difference people hanging friends again. hopefully Ch really stood for? That's great Following rules problem. 

going beach problem follow CDC guidlines. U companies fear making sufficiently large profit give large bonuses CEOs. someone claiming work field Facebook response mentioned studies shields less protective masks. also pointed focus wearing masks prevent spreading case infected know yet none studies peer reviewed opinions. Viruses .010-.10 microns. Surgical masks cloths masks aren’t designed stop items small. N95 barely stop it. masks stopping bacteria droplets. Might virus droplets. Sure. it’s going stop virus. mask mask dry. virus release rebreathed back yourself. interesting concept $10 million ($8 million based old formula 80s) derived. That's based much life worth employee's perspective (calculated measuring difference pay less dangerous dangerous jobs estimate premium worker places life based ""risk"" assessment).

The problem, course, governments looking one's life perspective. value life government much productivity life produce. would whatever contribution life toward GDP much taxes life generate, read closer $1 million.

That $30 trillion dollar price tag reduced tenfold we're looking like $3 trillion value lost lives according much value bring government. problem positions subjective based person calculating assumes important factors know (how much someone accept high risk job vs. much taxes someone pay lifetime) choices filtered formula mask objective variables. Possibly 

It’s definitely real fear.  accept Disney safe execs line entrance let everyone cough faces go in. Vietnam 30% people refuse take rushed vaccine history. won’t taking it. organization 6000 discrepancy last Sunday Sunday? idea correct translation would be? Google keeps failing me. COVID isn’t big deal.

*On surface...* 
So far know effects rightly concerned over... Clots body weakened/damaged organs. tons countries leave individual state/province/region. mandated masks nationwide. different? ate week ago, people masks on,"" added. ""But eat mask on?""

Taking mask cough 😆🤦🏽‍♂️ Oh god Keep mind “immunity” accurately described “resistance” disease. getting vaccine helps isn’t perfect. 

Someone isn’t vaccinated still cough huge loads virus infect others overcome resistance. that’s helps people interact also get vaccinated too.

Also, pay people’s silliness taxes insurance. saves money act safer don’t go hospitals. “May” asymptomatic. Branson big tourist destination part country. grandparents 2-3 weeks timeshares year. Yeah gonna compare numbers probably best use organization twice. find two compare want. NY virtually *stopped* pandemic, via measures. Possibly around 20% incidence rate.

(I'd love see another anti-body study latest numbers, obviously trickle ongoing cases still.)

Anyway, assuming NY still kinda holding back flood, numbers useful. words, example, show happens point. mean place charged $8 $0.12 popcorn soda people would go text phone, chat friends let babies learn talk movie played background? too, feel important reply me. Basically country Europe. sick day thing here, sick sick. call boss tell feeling well. I’ve come conclusion people think obesity terms people 600 pound life Dr. Phil specials people overweight literally lose weight right die. one thinks obese. heard many people say, I’m worried ‘rona, kills old people fat people. people 250 pounds. It’s like, uh, know obese too, right? not. think slightly overweight. Denial huge problem right now. Denial exists. Denial kills. Denial may contributing factor. Denial may gets sick actions. thing certain attention seeking b*tch. sympathy first comment subsequent comments erased every last drop that.

Calling someone unemployed loser favors. didn’t want assistance, wouldn’t made comment first place would chosen ignore. 

We hard time. downright rude people attempting assist clear public comment immature best. There's old saying Tennessee — know Texas, probably Tennessee — says, 'Lock down, lock... lock... cant get lockdown again'. news site really producing new information read article. repackaged old information reputable new sources saying awhile saying vaccine track September trials looking promising. Basically hyping old info ahead Oxford's release phase one trials learn today. confirm claims really waiting phase 3 trials effectiveness. we’re missing mass tourism we’d right  Fear blind one make one act irrationally, sometimes tragic consequences - Amadou Diallo might one noteworthy examples that.

In (corona) case though, fear would've preferred. all, Sweden's main failure slowly reacted. Covid-19 illness, virus. scientifically, title still makes sense. say 6 types SARS-CoV-2-- says 6 types Covid-19.

Yeah, governments Federal State level trying surpress level testing done. read statistic (think TX), they're 6 weeks behind tests already have, TX. Surely point see sustained decreases Covid hospitalizations across country.

Well historically CDC always point think world expecting US first rate response, like swine flu epidemic 2009 CDC quickly developed tests prevented spread. go far back Spanish flu, US forefront handle epidemics since developed containment procedures, vaccines, led struggle eradicate diseases etc.

Internationally CDC excellent reputation. roughly 4 million confirmed cases 150k deaths. *believe* confirmed cases, also *believe* deaths. think cases everyone gets tested. There’s certainly number asymptomatic low-risk people get test, therefore never confirmed cases. also think deaths. subtract 150k confirmed COVID deaths, still 30k deaths expected death count America back June. believe don’t know confirmed cases, also believe don’t know number deaths.

However, I’ve basing arguments based data believe. data says 4 million confirmed cases 150k deaths. 330 million Americans get infected, 11.25 million Americans die. Though don’t *believe* data correct, data support claim used upper bound.

Edit: Yes, goal always flatten curve. Properly flattening curve could definitely allow us avoid total infection. Even prevent half country infected, that’s still ton lives saved death rate high. Flattening curve could buy us time. don’t proper contact tracing. don’t rapid testing. took 15 days get negative test back. get proper testing proper contact tracing make sure packed bars concerts don’t happen, keep curve flat. shutdown buy us time open right way, would buy us time towards vaccine. don’t know we’re dealing with. can’t fix everything, doesn’t mean shouldn’t fix anything. fun take 3-5 years make vaccine normal case covid like 6month...  same! soon safely so, i’ll fiancé hiking rainforests costa rica finding eyelash vipers ocelots. i’ve trip planned long option leave country makes want much more.  must say opinion US European changed recent years thinking like paradise young thankful dont live there.

The times we've fought, pandemic-related. Usually hyper-vigilant little carefree safety. cases rising rapidly area, think we're page safety. Take one pun pass rest around, class. bars Florida closed weeks. Good fucking luck getting people take experimental vaccine rushed go typical anemic safety protocols normal vaccines (the ones cause much damage, cannot law sue vaccine manufacturer). Lol, ok. gotta account hundreds millions sitting around warehouses... subtract ones people take various reasons...plus everyone dies meantime... add *born* time vaccines get spread around... divide number billionaires attempting profit... add number independent regimes give out... multiply score multiplier depending timeline experiencing through, get [[redacted]](/r/fifthworldproblems). entire lifespan, yes, speak quite bluntly, value depreciates. like wake stupid every day lol Interesting Brazilian websites lot details actual timeline instead fake one. surrounding states legally close borders? course, nobody contract meeting ever promises something done month. get expedite money way, always say borderline impossible take way longer customer needs. Especially government KNOW money. there's safety issues know sort immune response, better deploy ASAP figure whether perfect good stopping coronavirus later? voters suffering consequence actions.

Alas, rest us also suffering consequences actions.  Disney's Vegas Vegas right now. Actual data proven cases ... Liverpool vs athletico Madrid match, Black lives matter beaches bournmouth, floriday etc times come news. 

With many cases actually quite difficult trace (prove) many people actually caught it.

All advice says safer outdoors safer safe. would take grain salt makes way reputable peer-reviewed journal, I'd still wary similar reports show up.  totalitarian regime free press. conflict interest see here...lol everyone stayed home society would collapse. assume want essential workers keep working no?  people need sing waiver saying need hospital bed well. mask bed. true vaccines already produced without knowing actually work, fully understand agree with. think even proven work mass delivered next 6-10 weeks even US/UK (and good would anyway, it’s pandemic), let’s say I’m optimistic lays anywhere within boundaries reality. Yea, it’s like exceptions won’t made worst public health crisis (that simultaneously destroying economy) life times anything. think (cytokine storm) generally around 9 days symptoms become present.  lost student car accident last year.

“Sprinkle little crack Johnson, open shut case”  Difficult get herd immunity COVID-19. Antibodies last month. People getting disease multiple times now.

It’s one countries planet tourist fire bazooka..

This virus exposed don’t rich combat it; braindead American truly hate people. ignorant destroying Western society. Russia accepting gringos believe mean vaccine permanent either?  Hahaha there’s problem! said “science facts”!

Seriously, people believe right believe anything. think entitled opinion Earth flat, Dr. Fauci wrong time, recommend drugs doctor right, experts field. believe “scientists” people went school get degree, hold job title, aren’t better them.

I’ve seen uneducated/educated old/young. don’t get it. don’t think people stupid necessarily bad people. maybe stupid. Maybe there’s fuck ton stupid people country realized.

Yep. haven’t eaten restaurant since early March. don’t plan anytime soon either. Source China thing? Russian operatives successful convincing Americans things harm economy. live Georgia. Kemp damn IDIOT! honestly can't stand see stupid face. Germany. US Government leadership done anything foolish? care stopping virus. care possibility stopping profit. lives livelihoods others never radar. Little people know wall Trump built keep US citizens inside.


Funny stuff  Wait. even live America, zero experience using ACA, expense American healthcare system, still think know enough know ""fucking dog shit?"" 

What even basing on? Masks, eye coverings face shield meant used together. Thing show science behind people trans natural bscked science disregard it.
The scientific concensus says transgenderism mental illness, biological care matter facts presented argue bad faith. follow feelings subject pretend read subject.
 morally intellectually deficient all. everyone wearing mask type matter much even crappy masks provide protection around wearer. everyone around wearing mask keeping distance risk transmission relatively low, even they're wearing crappy, low quality cloth masks. main issue people often wear mask, wear wrong keep distance puts around higher risk getting infected.

Obviously, better mask likely protected. Personally, go anywhere indoors without KN95 face shield. I'm currently looking getting protective goggles prevent aerosol transmission. I'm mostly others care enough wear mask properly (if wear one all) keep biggest overall concern surgical mask, KN95, n95, etc really counterfeits. way truly judge efficacy unless sourced reputable supplier (note Amazon reputable supplier).

Same here, make sure buy KN95 masks recalled. also avoid going crowded places much can, especially indoors (e.g. grocery store, malls, etc).

Another thing increase chances mask protect tape edges create seal infected air get sides/top/bottom (mainly works KN95 surgical masks made good materials may seal properly. pretty useless cloth masks). one. run one soaked gasoline carrying American flag shouting freedom die needlessly. Herd immunity isn’t even guaranteed. Coronavirus could become endemic. dog fight. actually interest either vaccine year think corners cut governments get market faster. also want say one company better worse either. amazing use data includes false information, death statistic new york shows 6-7000 died nursing homes instead accurate 11-12000 actually died many died hospitals.

You also listed Arizona one states higher infection rates yet source data Arizona. fear every elderly person there. Home Depot saw man 70, obese mask (in FL). felt profound sadness Pity thinking might’ve watching dead mN walking. Odd exact phrase came head. Honestly disturbing.. just? course, get working, widely distributed vaccine, return ""normal"". god forbid forget this, like many tragedies, first pandemic humanity faced, certainly last. hay peor ciego que el que quiere ver Best practice dine in. But, here. doesn't, that's fallacious argument used appeal authority. I'm understanding he's fighting mayor. Huh? 

Fauci treated like infallible god majority people USA... found funny one respected universities world odds - least week two ago. Go Rona! policy enforcing said policies two completely different things though. going random person going around making sure people noses exposed, cover properly? Goofy going double work slap Karens? 

[x] Doubt even vaccine aids virus, colour dubious we'll get shot C19 time soon familiar america. US government likely give companies hundreds millions dollars get first dibs, allow charge insurance companies hundreds dollars vaccine.

Trump purposely securing prices vaccine taxpayer dollars subsidize. president, democratic republican would secured cheap price exchange r&amp;d funding. Barbados offering remote work year visa - could change mind... isn’t single person saying never go back normal... hop time machine tell long term effects disease known couple months?

If not, ask stupid question? need close down'

#YOU SAY? don’t think you’re correct. insults prove poor argument. Also, “capably”? That’s word. don’t care think ignore comment you. according vaccine maker: 

The vaccine COVID-19, developed University Oxford, UK, tests Brazil, may become available population year, said Maria Augusta Bernardini, medical director pharmaceutical group Astrazeneca. British-Swedish group participating research conducted British university partnership Federal University São Paulo (Unifesp).

“We expect preliminary data regarding real efficiency already available around October November,” said Bernardini Monday (29) talk broadcast live online UK ambassador Brazil Vijay Rangarajan. also said that, even though volunteers observed year, vaccine might distributed population period over. right think buildaberg is? worship I'm taking one dogs put sleep tomorrow. good life, old, sick cancer. time. I've say goodbye many pets years, right now, times, loss hits much harder. she’s asymptomatic Don’t hold breath. Good job electing idiot. Thing is, companies already producing storing tens millions doses. absolutely reasonable near immediate availability. mostly distribution point. I'm sure policy already place gets vaccinated when. 

It's case vaccine gets approved, mass production begins. Production actually absurdly cheap per dose, process trials whatnot costs ton. business side decides makes sense millions doses ready approved. bad throw issues arise. 

I'm going trust experts say vaccine could widely distributed end 2020. Never happened Mmm... uncrustables. Let's try keep positive - we're good situation, comment thread replying to. Thanks! dad really bad allergies stopped too. Allergy shots antihistamines help, still fun :( Um they’re not. president doesnt help things either.  city looks like Legend right 30,000 people died. Right, complied bothered ask reasonable questions. signed done like every positive patient, seemingly, gone normal lives. 

Got it.

You realize optics ultimately hurt testing, correct? Particularly KY mandate exists. humans invent better idiot  Sure, public companies ""manipulate stock prices"" one way legitimate means. 

[I'm referring potentially illegal/unethical type stock price reading care shitty.

I think would upset that, could read.


I lived Georgia long time ago young kid teens. born fit well ""question everything"" attitude. Lived couple hours Jacksonville Florida airport.

Give 6 feet snow I'll build fucking house trenches love life. Bulgaria Romania banned us yet? Manhattan near water. What's plan here? Life-flight hundreds people gulf every single day? It’s already way past that. reported cases limited testing capacity, prevalence, positive test rate high testing delay long. wouldn’t surprised Florida 100k day right now. 

It’s interesting question ‘how bad it’ gets answered Americans american way life. Interestingly, forced labor discussed report Uighurs working prisons camps, transferred workers. One thing note, [China secretive latter, actually boasts accomplishment](http://www.xj.chinanews.com/dizhou/2020-03-14/detail-ifzumzav7894342.shtml) \-- employment, eliminating Uighur poverty NYT's visual investigation mentioned article, somehow close cuts PPE factories Uighur workers Chinese state media. guess actual investigation factories workers' status made. 

Does labor transfer automatically equals forced labor? Well, ""forced"" used sense ""Capitalism forces work spend"", guess yes... also remember vaccine HPV new teenager, multiple people died it.

In state getting absolutely bludgeoned virus, trying roll back mandatory wear-a-mask orders fundamentally irresponsible. amount 'fallacious argument' statements change that.

Kemp wrong.

No debate necessary nothing debate. He, along rest numbskulls loudly yelling ""my freedom!"" this, fundamentally putting others risk.

If want risk that's choice. COVID give fuck choices, wearing mask endangers others.

Discussion over. put damned mask already. me, it’s unwilling. haven’t seen papers put saying weren’t able to. husband boat - can’t work gets okay test negative day 11 now. I’m Massachusetts; got hit really hard early on. Thanks overall intelligent population, long shutdown, $300 fine anyone obeying mask law, feel generally safe. We’re less 20 deaths day new cases 100-200 range per day. It’s obviously perfect compared states, really well, especially went beginning. I’m genuinely proud way handled this. 

I obviously still worry parents. worry rest country good people stuck states people aren’t taking seriously. I’m crying sleep every night anymore though, that’s cool. would wonderful. hope true.

Whether kids receive priority, know anything back up. far seems kids least vulnerable. possible kids might get prioritized get back school though. yeah, rich people absolutely get hands first can. stopping long rich people making rules. However, also pretty likely vaccine becomes one world uses, western countries populations get anywhere else, particularly developing underdeveloped world. 94 low end 94-99 range fine. 83 night concerning. Make sure share doctor, haven’t already. going issue teachers, well. difficulties online teaching preferable dead kids teachers. question. Idk. I’m there. know 30k cases (1 100), like 750-1000 new cases, enforced masks.

Divorce Crossed mind? assume there's stuff going far outweighs husband providing family? might purposely seeing stuff normal way function job. That's literally do: 'normal' +mask+hand sanitizer. Exactly! person goes college thinking : ""30K? Yeah, I'd totally love that! *And* buy supplies class? Sign up!"" Teachers disrespected America, absolutely wonder education system failure. 

And think crux debate many people actually believe people *deserve* die pandemic. ""God's Will."" ""Well fat."" ""They've lived life anyway."" People keep tossing 'condolences' like candy makes pretty sad honestly. hope new governors years later look back year try best better normal. can’t get another job you’re dead. There’s resurrecting dying. don’t understand people would rather sacrifices lives economy, it’s insane. grocery store allows non maskers, yes, would excellent plan. Socrates wrong flaws democracy — good quality participants. hope knew story bound leak out. going come again, trickle duplicates everyone's stream. 

If potty mouth, there's sure good sound bites. Serious question. republicans Russian sleeper agents called upon kill many Americans possible, would act differently? Oh im sorry I'm saying extra 600 enough Utah. may read thread wrong. apologies. forget direct connection 5g network. need expansive phones anymore. tried raking leaves?  Melbourne shut fines wearing mask possibly work days. Can’t leave house 300 cases day Guess don’t weep long coz covid make brief Hmm.... Unfortunately, without hard evidence, think wishful thinking. found article explained bad would actually achieve herd immunity without vaccine (not Italy, using US example):

""To reach herd immunity COVID-19, likely 70% population would need immune. Without vaccine, 200 million Americans would get infected reach threshold. Put another way, even current pace COVID-19 pandemic continues United States – 25,000 confirmed cases day – well 2021 reach herd immunity. current daily death rates continue, half million Americans would dead COVID-19 think even Italy made bad. think everyone else right: Italy's lockdown worked. slack much another outbreak happens, could another wave death again. underestimated stupidity people country pandemic restaurants signs said ""No shirts, shoes, service."" deserve go restaurant bare-chested bare-footed get service red-blooded American? 

What seem understand freedom whatever hell want ends doorsteps people's properties businesses. like restrictions, patronize businesses. Except that's said all. even places never closed get close 70%. confirmed news sources? think time. Sure, average American citizen $400 cash hand handle unexpected emergency, people discretionary income spending it, aren’t likely time soon. one remodeling home, buying boat, buying car, taking fam Disneyland, etc... they’re scared die they’re paying 33% premium groceries delivered Costco via instant cart playing toys home.

Wow. yeah how’s stock market Depends “they” are. conversation, I’m referring “they” people don’t trust science feel entitled wrong opinions. think types people always existed, voice. Social media allows us see many idiots exists. may quiet feel empowered aren’t alone. People denied science throughout history. think? swimming pool high list things would avoid. Maybe indoors, packed.

Did ever close restaurants? Schools? Movie theaters? Playgrounds? triggered black people 11 days results come insane. Research done someone infectious early stages.

Countries releasing people hospital isolation amount time...

You get result time. what? Also cases dead virus fragments showing tests. accept war offer promptly surrender motherfuckers go home, literally want wear tyrannical seat belt.... really, really, really hope right. However, logic reasoning gives absolutely zero confidence makes think moron. Still, hope right. ""Like told you, Mexican companies funding wall. since people liked idea much, Canada also began paying wall.""   wonder think millions people dying ripple effect too. lol Doctors know much, much treating bad covid cases. biggest help understanding oxygen levels got low. realized blood clotting moved using blood thinners ventilators. Another game changer discovering certain steroids helped patients. Another big discovery patients dying Happy Hypoxia - oxygen levels getting low without feeling shortness breath. check patients oxygen levels matter feel. also know people low oxygen helped simply laying prone position bellies. 

And theres top that.

Less people dying know treat much better now. continue. remember Italy freaking fuck rapid spread. Nobody gives fuck US. Lmao Ron DeathSentence. Perfect Next ... refrigerator trucks. 

Those already put place...

[TAMPA, FL - JULY 06: Six refrigerator trailers sit outside Hillsborough County Medical Examiners Office July 6, 2020 Tampa, Florida. Florida experiencing another surge COVID-19 cases reopening early June, cases surpassing 200,000 really shocking though knew US well? Schools Florida fully opening three weeks teachers already dying already. defies logic. Stores designated entrances exits now, people don’t pass way out.

Just look effective is: say sounds nice theory practice, see often different story. weak link people would wager many people going Disney World concerned virus. yeah grifting complicated everyone natural it. 

this guy however ain't 40k year nice try wont see numbers go back start open up. ask 4 months. Wow. Mmm, lunch time. Ooo thanks! Welcome neighbor! currently year 12 Australia (Senior) state currently isolated state rising Covid cases (Victoria)

So far, year 11 12's still required attend school last stretch content continue delay exams January. Normally exams finish end November, apply University. 

If things still delayed 2020 class may able attend first semester University, basically attend online postpone things. healthy horse (insulting horses 😅) live 150 yrs old haha! Tried think appropriate animal comparison 1. Insulting animals 2. Non human animals let happen themselves!

Have agree w good ones September 6 weeks away, wtf think? Mmmmmmmmm........ bacon....... That'd well earned vacation Frontline workers. Whether hospital, ems grocery meat packing plant. real heroes. She’s taking piss. cringe mean finally coming light. There's plenty models wore masks privacy reasons already. doubt someone started associating fetishes became one itself.

From ""a commitment provide 400 million end 2020,""

400 million enough cover population US UK (330 million 67 million respectively).  Obviously drugs

NO! *shocked pickachu* asked 6 months ago: “In modern day scenario would U.S. unable/unwilling what’s necessary put stop uncontrollable pandemic?,” truly would able think one. call us [brave little :-). interesting Republican politicians always weighed corporate interests lives constituents. problem time goes become harder mask fact.


Look ""democrat"" healthcare act tried make unpopular calling ""obama-care"" good people cost corporate gains. Republican party leaders changed tune all, blunt ever been.


As Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said, sacrifice people economy know got them. control group important variable group terms determining efficacy. going kind hard mail vote :( Covid control goddamn beach chain!! 

O.o Close fucking beaches already. Duhhhh think they’re over-achiever probably miles better think, regardless, it’s lot work.

Oh know hard learn language especially (my brain work right). grant work Japan even taking course could ask answer basic questions there. delusions could study year get fluent. would happy least get toddler level language even know would take work persistent. I’m worried Florida getting bad shortly. whole situation disintegrating nurses can’t expected hold shoulders. Moving around oxygen tanks burning daily. hope story gets many people possible, especially anti-mask people think it’s flu Yes, want end get better. BLM protests gonna look like fucking Sunday picnic compared what’s gonna going America one month today think there's expression grief, there's end sight. over, I'm sure people commemorate gone. now, grief every single day. bot ridiculous...bad bot I'd argue they're biggest cover century. didn’t say next *qualified* man up... (sorry I'm gonna *that* guy)

with legit math we're talking March 142nd (31 days March May, 30 April June, 20 far July)

or wanted go back February could say Feb. 171st -- taking Leap Year account, naturally O:-) many Redditors going remember watching 1975 movie theaters That's Florida doing. Probably want copying Florida. wealthy accumulate wealth. United States, would seem appropriate kind memorial built remember victims pandemic, praise health care workers toiled tirelessly help patients, scientists continue search vaccine. I'm curious, would memorial look like you? Maybe statue three figures it. would interesting hear see images different people's ideas. feds entire lull get ppe situation worked hospitals still short. fucking joke. one disturbing things read pandemic. mother retired intensivist, consulting Society Critical Care Medicine find human resources states struggling. shared her. is, course, appalled infuriated. also thinks hospital far one endangering patients everybody working them.

When asked mother nurses make organized walkouts situations like these, said that, experience, virtually nurses unshakable sense duty patients care. Leaving patients even sharply reducing number nurses looking would unthinkable most. dedication goes beyond ethical minefield trading welfare current patients better conditions future patients. paramount sense duty human care right now.

It seems best hope fix reporting type. truly terrifies wondering whether many hospitals states worst outbreaks going wind operating looking like one demand beds care outstrip completely resources available.

My mother said that, among many others, one worrisome feature current situation Florida, Texas, Arizona southern California, - unlike New York needed nurses technicians, etc able get travelling nurses - nurses previously would travelled staying put home states either facing upsurge likely will. can't help wonder potential travelling nurses turn assignments conditions believe patients face. Almost like non-profits

(Because someone say it, Catholic Church Rome megachurches representative churches US. don’t make money) identical headcounts identical salaries predisaster period, (not exceed 99K per annum, though) theory, could shuffle around. Banks going review kind scrutiny smaller loans. SBA already gave instructions. theory, startup founder making 60k could take sales job salary layoff making 120k, chop $99k give violate anything rules. higher % people taking seriously places. plenty anti-mask idiots, there’s large number people basically haven’t left houses apartments since March. Moderna US? they’ve achieved success entering Phase III I’m getting shot, I’m training 🏆 Good one leisure travel right now. program made realize would rather busk work job pays less people getting program. 

My minimum wage job ""essential"" working full time making less people working. fucking ridiculous. bachelor's degree combat veteran, even attending 5+ recruit military job fairs, I've yet receive job offer pays people got unemployment. Ive interviewed two positions paid better.

To make things worse, minimum wage job cut hours loud vocal following corporate COVID safeguard policies. refused let take mandatory COVID training. didnt inform coworkers coworker tested positive. didnt need name, aware close contact someone positive would good information know. dont weakened immune system know know that. know disability reasonable accommodation, informing us coworker testing positive something felt needed tell us. 

I've waiting appeals service connected disability 2017, estimated 2.5-8yr wait.

Im saying people getting money, ""essential"" workers making less getting too.

Then icing cake, never got stimulus. Honestly, he's lucky got heckled. deserves far worse death count head. Someone's got lot praying do. submission removed because


**Titles must edited source.** submissions must submitted original title submitted article applicable. article uses caps title, changed [title Editorialization via title editing kind likely removed. ([More believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* actually looked before. here's dealio:

If want immigrate to, let's say, Canada, there's bunch shit need first getting Express Entry (meaning higher-skilled worker):

* need prove education equivalent Canadian degree. costs $200 USD based five designated organizations use.

* need prove speak either English French fluently approved organization, costs $300 USD.

* need pass physical panel physician generally covered insurance. family must also go physical *even coming you*. generally $400 USD per person.

* cost *just* apply $1.6k CAD one person, add $800 spouse $200 per child.

These application/testing fees... Take also, generally takes six months tell whether made not. There's also lot cost terms time.

So yeah... help pay I'll happily move.  I'm honestly even sure trying argue.

Generally speaking, public health experts specifically *not* recommending general public wear masks late March/early April. includes Fauci, Redfield, Birx, CDC, WHO, state health deparments, more. European CDC begin recommending mask usage general population mid April.

I've wearing mask since February change facts public officials telling people do.

Also, please provide source now-removed claim San Francisco indoor mask *mandate* March. First Sweden lull, [preparing another wave. 

Second, implement mitigation measures. i.e. occupancy restrictions restaurants, social distancing, banning large gatherings etc.  Let self flaggellation begin! Repent! doomers again? vaccine efficacy yet proven likely wont while.....

in opinion gonna need booster shots shit brand new vaccine potentially treatment showed anecdotal benefit One million people installed first 36 hours, app currently 1.3 million installations. figure represents 30% people Ireland compatible devices.

Mandatory tracking good, expire. People motivated find outcome find evidence it. string together couple anecdotes like narrative filter echo chamber. 

Covid massive administrative challenge. course, false positives. However, evidence false negatives far compelling. “it unclear whether death removed overall count state.”

So there’s evidence accidentally death counted COVID death. Hm mad king great either ;) agree! hate it, people see local news saying need go work 2 - 3 jobs McDonalds make need pay bills since ""Lazy"" want work.

I hate statements every fiber being......

Working 2-3 slave wage jobs make ends meet norm.  Here's latest case/death charts running 7-day averages Hidalgo county (which contains scary slopes. think death rates increasing (while countries reducing rates) terrifying? Another article doesn’t understand rate is.

They mean daily death TOLL, rate. simple SAT math terms, c’mon. think anecdotal truth it, sufficiently understood yet whether handful confirmed instances happening exception rule. read paper, describe hypothesis called ""Mojiang Miners Passage (MMP) hypothesis."" I'll quote:

""\[W\]e propose miners’ lungs offered unprecedented opportunity accelerated evolution highly bat-adapted coronavirus highly human-adapted coronavirus decades ordinary coronavirus evolution could easily condensed months.""

In words, they're proposing single bat virus human infection, got deep lung tissue, could enough replicate would ordinarily ""20-50 years ordinary evolution"". resulting evolved virus, drawn miner, would SARS-CoV-2.

The question I'm asking is: single infection enough turn virus lethal machine now, kind undermine whole lab escape hypothesis? words, hypothesis human naturally exposed RaTG13 cave, naturally evolved SARS-CoV-2 within lungs. lab really play significant role evolution: happens nature. story, lab kind postscript amazing story natural viral evolution. throw naturally-evolved virus freezer accidentally release later on.

Of course, natural evolution SARS-CoV-2 possible single infection RaTG13, person easily caught related bat virus 2019, gotten deep lungs, passed resulting virus along humans SARS-CoV-2? decide rapid evolution natural bat pathogens possible nature following single infection, lab seem necessary story anymore. live two blocks beach LA County. place fucking hell right now. Wish city close enough could live mountains commute could avoid people. 😑  Thats still less someone ending ICU like week America There's good segment employers ""complying"" reopen, give damn people customers. shows, they'll shit like 'move operations outside' stuffy tent ventilation. signed heard anything yet. think deny give reason, wont call selected. yet know long immunity lasts, all. know sounds kinda lame effective, imagine 1000's people bombarding poli's emails social media time, would get attention know nurses NJ got hit bad months ago, multiple hospital wards became covid wards. Covid patients everywhere. can’t believe one learned us. excuse. Again, match information presented hospital capacity state. keep hearing stories morgues, refrigerated trucks lack EMS. Yet, confronted fairly low death totals (which undergoing exponential growth). deaths tallied? Living US easy get disheartened anti-mask / anti-vaaxers, zoom &amp; it’s obvious - species - stand shoulders giants

It makes emotional thinking tremendous loss coronavirus presented us. &amp; hard work done combat idiots everywhere true *release date*. Moderna vaccine also late stages development like Oxford one. terribly surprising. Diet lifestyle huge impact immune system. People sedentary, drink often, stay hydrated, eat vegetables going fair well serious illness still sure Covid spreads virus novel. Data collected  dude 2016 sick team awesome, pretty much everybody made team awesome left. Europe call Americans :) thats gonna 1500 mile hike get thanks! would bet $100 (which lot pandemic destroyed career now) didn’t write tweet.

Make $110. never suggested strategy, worded caution extremism unorganized violence. really strategies, logistics. Rioting tactic. hate Trump.

🤔😐😆 got news ya bud... interesting article.

The headline says ""45 Florida hospitals ICU beds"", right?

So .. obviously supposed give bit ""OMG!"" moment. sounds bad.

But ... read article, cant find 45 ""out of"".

Like .. ok .. 45 ICUs. many though? 45 good bad?

Is 45 47 hospitals? 45 530 hospitals?

So article doesnt say all. context. alarming headline.

But .. wait! There's more!

What older article found July 07? 

[""Dozens Florida hospitals available ICU beds, state data *that* article says ICUs full 54 hospitals across 25 Florida’s 67 counties, according data published Tuesday morning state’s Agency Health Care Administration.

Well .. hold on. July 07 54 full hospitals, article July 20 45 full hospitals.

That .. *improvement*.

Right?

So dont give much faith articles. trying inform you. trying *alarm* you. really much say that. Good. Teachers simply refuse show campus go active strike. children hard working / underpaid teachers must put harms way, must use children vehicle infect families. anything new experimental, experimental say moderna type vaccine never used humans before. new vaccine based existing vaccine type vaccine used already diseases. 

I trying downplay moderna, mRNA vaccines. work safely, produce exponentially vaccine much lower cost much faster timeframe. massive manufacturing plant effectively small laboratory.

I mean wow touch reality Americans live.

End rant Well, don’t exclude Islamic countries, exclude people based colour skin, religion, gender identity and/or sexual orientation. also accept refugees, people escaping fascist regimes, asylum seekers, more. point system criteria becoming citizen, it’s better US system broken AF I'm also American grad school Norway. accepted, showed tourist completed residence permit paperwork arriving. Immigration processes sometimes pretty flexible. read, CanSino (Chinese medical tech company) got precisely point Oxford, vaccine keeps running issues. higher age less effective (beyond 55yrs old there's zero response). Pre-existing conditions make poor vaccine response; critical worry COVID got blood clot/damage organs.  Also immunity last past couple months farwhich seems suggest rolling set vaccines may future. Say every 6 months go doctor get shot. lot fellow Americans stubbornly kept saying can't happen here. Many still saying even happening around us. Italian study larger base cases.

Whatever real number is, fact still even 10% conveys epic stupidity humanity. I've trying tell parents Houston. nearly 70 mom respiratory issues, go eat restaurants every weekend. Even lucky get covid, random health emergency die there's room hospitals. Everyone needs stay home get numbers down. Good you. make less true common side effects flu vaccine flu like symptoms (body aches, slight fever, headache, muscle aches)

But need source, listen good news, seems like obvious strategy, cheap twice cost either way ends up. Wallace ~~decent~~ Fox News anchor.

There.. fixed it. ....Pleasure pirates? Kinky Works Utah. certainly exaggeration. actually meant this:

**Most** developed countries able handle virus responsible way. choices haven’t “either everyone gets virus x percentage population dies, close country mitigate deaths x percentage population can’t survive.” seems able close without risking 10% population going homeless. 

I hate people talk things without providing proof that’s something I’m right now. means disagree, I’m open hearing it.

Meanwhile there's evidence catch Covid twice weeks. probable control pandemic fast home testing wait vaccine. literally biggest biomedical challenge history mankind. We're solving couple months. Look Ebola: also international concern yet December 2019 first vaccine came, used special circumstances.

Because result votes. anti science attitude government, incompetence corruption.

With better leadership, US could Europe is: woods, much better position.

Republican voters suffering consequence actions. interpreting they're saying wrong understanding I'm saying number people infected COVID definitely way higher current recorded numbers. However, number dead people from/with COVID accurate. 

And immaterial means 2.7% calculated recorded confirmed COVID cases reality add number non-recorded COVID cases (that is, people asymptomatic, never got tested never knew COVID) said percentage go dramatically.

Like said previously, brute crude extrapolation. take account *details* assessment simplistic. world wide scale, given limited understanding virus, using information make prediction mortality enough actually come reasonable number death people COVID (and COVID) question; total number infected COVID is.

Again: question *cannot answered* using analysis. information _at best_ indication we're completely fucked layman terms; said 2.7% pessimistic number, 

As even _need_ explain ""layman's terms""? 

It optimistic number methodology. even insulting, considering rote statistics sufficient make valuable predictions real number close 1% consider early days, dead people survived hospitalization got tested healthy people infected COVID symptoms never got test.

What systemic analysis virus interactions body? _This_ information need reliably calculate kind useful metric involving mortality.

The fact insistent validity data without taking question _methodology_ indication lack real understanding scientific analysis.

We also discussing crucial factors vary considerably among populations.

Don't forget happened China. Wups. mistake.
And yes. flew survey damage. Either went way hated wanted take joy suffering, cared wanted see damage himself. he's shown he's cared others many situations well.

The learn virus, deadlier proving be. don’t even need experience symptoms become permanantly disabled body’s immune response. feel totally fine one day next begin life cripple hardly breathe. danger virus is, day, vastly understated. need national lockdown. lol Big news sources busy spreading scare new virus. Good news doesn’t sell. Remember Federal government bought Remdesivir production two months plus, apologists Trump tried convince everyone distribution states needed it, ok Trump ""for Americans""?


Remember Jared Kushner's comments Federal stockpiles supplies?

Same system rest supplies Fed bought/stolen/repurposed throughout whole pandemic.  priorities:

1) President, GOP, relatives, cronies

2) Graft profit selling supplies bought using FEMA priority purchases

3) Supplies used provide positive press Trump

4) Supplies handed GOP party members' states quid pro quo support issue future ""favor""

5) Supplies sent places GOP candidates facing tough reelection attempt buy votes

6) Supplies given Democrats personally states buy important vote (e.g., eliminate liability companies ""re-opening"") Absolutely. Right lot people think vaccine going ‘cure’ isn’t. 

A vaccine isn’t going flatten curve new infections. It’s going nightmare. 

Trump administration tout cure everything fine people get sick we’ll uninformed saying obviously vaccine/cure doesn’t work it’ll exacerbate mess. take fedora buddy Holy shit. That's rough number. order door dash GrubHub fairly often always leave outside apartment door. one time guy understand request handed me, cool. FINALLY GOOD FUCKING NEWS YEAR. YESSSSIIIIIIR! Every round. *Y. pestis* killed epidemic waves rather constant rate every year. new epidemic became possible (immune) survivors old epidemic aged died. guy named Joe finds dire trouble. business gone bust he’s serious financial trouble. He’s desperate decides ask God help.

He begins pray… “God, please help me. I’ve lost business don’t get money, I’m going lose house well. Please let win lotto.”

Lotto night comes somebody else wins it.

Joe prays… “God, please let win lotto! I’ve lost business, house I’m going lose car well”.

Lotto night comes Joe still luck.

Once again, prays… “My God, forsaken me?? I’ve lost business, house, car. wife children starving. don’t often ask help always good servant you. PLEASE let win lotto one time get life back order.”

Suddenly blinding flash light heavens open Joe confronted voice God Himself:

“Joe, meet halfway this. Buy ticket.”  particularly trust them, states publish numbers state website, seems like would tough cook books without getting caught. called ""Canadian raising"", exists. Words ""out"" sound different.

""Aboot"" common way spell making fun it. exaggeration really sounds like. That's going difficult, considering I'm Indian living India life :) problem trump cronies actively suppressing manipulating numbers make seem bad, I'm worried people remember even know time comes. Private lab tests people critically ill least admitted hospital available short time March. backlog tests became big restricted within 1-2 weeks healthcare workers critical patients. sad part Bexar County even political bullshit point. 

I know plenty republicans liberals following mask mandates. Hell know idiots partying huge get togethers since March. Bill Gates covid-19 forced chip vaccination...Fucking morons. like wildfire country...except fight actual wildfires vigorous, coordinated unified fashion. vaccine produces T-cells, read article. T-cells produce lasting resistance virus. let people leave designated eating areas food drinks. Pretty simple enforce. rope area designated entries exits. fake news. They're reporting single day, trend. Cases still rise. unbelievable ""America testing death country.""    
White House statement. mean anti-choice Oh yeah I’m aware cells remember weeks back people weren’t sure cells alone would enough someone explain vaccine entered P3 already getting manufactured large levels? 300 million US/UK September ridiculous wishful thinking, working vaccine produced distributed world end 2021 sounds realistic. I’m sure everyone best sooner expect mass vaccination happen 2020 ludicrous.

We lucky proven countermeasures (as medicine slows infection already contaminated person) timeline put forward vaccine here. Lombardy (Italy), didn’t even treat someone 65 anymore. 

There *little* bit difference 70 year old guy know stick tube throat blast lungs full oxygen likely die, decide use procedure someone better chance survive rate lags weeks way. Today’s deaths deaths positive cases 2-3 weeks ago.

Doesnt seem like Show experimental evidence acting like health department, emergency services, hospital want woman die. utter nonsense. 

Had signed agreement first place would moot. medical emergency, health department likely known did, would do? Jail her? Show instance happening quarantined covid-19 patient seeking medical attention. one. across country covid 19 patients agreed quarantine home many ended hospital. even one charged crime that?

Now is.being monitored, medical emergency, call 911 (which btw CDC instructs covid 19 patient do) whoever calling explains emergency, also explain ankle monitor.

She Karen deliberately making stink agencies serious problems worrying about. spin already well underway blame ""young people"" ""incompetent malevolent governance.""   Better understanding treatments means nothing available beds and/or enough doctors treat avalanche ever increasing cases. It’s coronavirus? [X] mean state run news ticker propaganda video trying make transfers seem good Uighurs? cannot read Chinese trust you. doesnt make trust ticker's statement applies Uighurs, Uighurs presented either. Especially journalist's research narrative. He's done good job pitting people other, he? you, personally, able remain reasonably safe, social distancing whatnot? Sounds like lot people forced go work. Even here, though (in Canada), people go &amp; more. things better now, us doubts whether going stay way. Today Learned :) ironically learnt Perth isolated. customers also subject fined? Unsavory: them, those, others, like us... fuking absurd lol made laugh hard. efficient!!! uSeRnaME chECkS oUT.

I’m trying mock country. feel really bad guys; cousins live Texas maybe that’s keen keeping updated what’s going US. guys amazing movies, sports teams, vacation spots. I’m even American cried watching Hamilton Disney plus day. There’s lot guys rightfully proud of. 

That said, think attitude “It’s bad think” exactly led country path thousands people dying everyday people scared go hospitals even though virus hospital bills seven figures. really care southern neighbors wish well — good hard look oneself taken entire world literally shunning actively banning coming countries.

I really hope year rock bottom everything gets incrementally better moving forward. wish loved ones good health peace. Take care. vaccine produces T-cells, meaning anti body’s may last shorter time, you’ll continuing resistance virus. ever sell steaks set fake university?  Even true, trusts words coming Xi. know don't. coronavirus published numbers total lie everything else? person said Spanish called Italians brothers. Wasn’t meant Italian work pharmacy, even behind counter dispensing scripts, retail part, amount people come us lieu seeing doctor insane. I’ve help dog maulings, arms caught elevator doors, sports injuries countless sick people really doctor hospital. We’re place people go they’re “not sick enough doctor” early symptoms Covid-19... that’s us right firing line.   recently said another comment, interesting way start conversation someone give look pause say American, reassure you’re states local area/a country two smartest use gloves I've seen outside healthcare facilities one person wore (same gloves) day prevent hand sanitizer drying skin. person sanitized hands several times hour, clients, sanitized gloves constantly. either that, washing hands dry changing gloves several times per hour.

I'm exempt vaccines definitely made lasting impact trust vaccines general. going college hopes working vaccine safety figuring would risk adverse reactions learned liability immunity.

Edit correct year  Very, lucky indeed them, good hear. still fascinating people barely get affected others survive. hope time find reason is. Y’all barely broke 1% infection rate. y’all goin herd immunity, avoid needing vaccines, y’all better get yer rears gear, got moar infectin do. Science friend. really agree this, 100%. US heavily taxed, Federal country, taxes national state level, local level well. issue disjointed, spending also pretty weird. 

I think safe say spend much military, amongst things (like Trump's McDonalds bill must roof).

On flip side, must say France's national health service heavily debt, able get debt, ever. way increase tax, decrease coverage (which happening, little little). 

There perfect system, US could help average joe fighting chance! Good, Indonesia huge population here's hoping works. Yeah, rich people companies. Oxford signed deal global distribution vaccine, started trials, April. totally right. Mass concentrations people close proximity engaging redress grievances could never induce spread. It’s economic activity would that. remember see data 2-3 weeks ago, delayed testing results long incubation times. observing train analog film someone took developed delivered via mail. American lives overseas/in EU. It’s funny conversation people ask you’re from, say America reassure you’re local area/only country over. anecdote ring true everyone, change fact illegal many states. could see Leave *immediately*, leave house 2 weeks anything Friends colleagues US asked several times pay high taxes income. working US, I’d able keep money.



Duh, yes, pay almost 50% taxes provide social health security everyone country. need doctor, go see one. fear debt years it. get sick, don’t pay thousands euros treatment.



One colleague US told „something brain“ saving money afford doctors appointment find exactly was. flabbergasted. 


I’d rather pay taxes sure nobody make decision life money....



And yes, Vienna nice city. still prefer Innsbruck. Nothing beats mountains surrounding it. city center also beautiful. what? 

You sound butthurt...

I think explained point good enough. disagree articulate opinions suggestions fairly free like opinions suggestions (it place communicate know like comment section). think thats great.

Nevermind, Stay safe healthy friend. went years back weekend trip friend thought would cute town map meet in, didn’t know anything town (she lives Reno live sf nice halfway point) met weekend actually doesn’t surprise they’d ignorant. People seemed nice enough ,but felt like scene horror film small town inbreeds. seem bit back woods. trying defund every budget Trump released.  long Republicans keep cheering everytime someone denies science, find success. amount money give cdc nih I'd think much, especially considering always find money military police. pretty massive deal right ? Much Bahamas economy based tourism especially american tourism . shit bad even want entertain us get virus control says lot. sure that. health system shambles brought upon since tried close Lombardy contain pandemic people decided flee overnight region going back homes, effectively making things worse.

Italy definitely handled shitty hand first European region infected populous region too, could done better nonetheless LOL that’s actually hilarious.  Yeah, I'd move France Belgium, I'd lose 10k EUR per year! Insane! already pay heaps here, think 65k EUR take home around 42k Well, test people regardless background nationalities arrivals. Thats diplomat tested positive. country wouldnt test let spread around. find crazy numbers say restaurants open, people going numbers high absolutely blows mind, numbers UK high even go supermarket. Ugh. must gigantic undercount loss life. around 900 day cut 50% reason!? So, mass concentrations people practicing social distancing wearing masks induce spread economic activity engaged upon? know theres two-lane road going one direction, narrows one lane construction whatever, cars queue one lane fit gap, theres always people pull queue drive front line expect allowed zipper merge back in? Every one people thinks they're smart dumb following rules, world full them. I’m sure they’ll fine taking space hospitals pulling medical staff away patients get it, know since it’s personal risk. ICU nurse here, source please. Bahamas open tourism US, actually. lot Caribbean is. I'm guessing mortality hospitalization rates group low. absolutely allowed move another country. 

Why hell would want anyone moving pandemic though? 

Much less default escape chute panicking yanks. We're backup country. Fix shit horde ruin already do. Something bad, mean exactly?  billionaires make billions? suggesting don’t earn billions upon billions dollars selling fruits university’s labour absolutely ridiculous prices customers don’t choice? you, communist? /s   America never sent convicts Australia. UK send convicts US sent Australia. exactly Dutch government says masks give false sense safety. crowded areas. avoided al times. Personally think people get first:

1:Healthcare workers

2: emergency workers(Cops, firefighters)

3: Youth. Many people age (26) staying inside anyways might well give vaccine, least spreading around.

After work getting everyone else. Oh fuck ""Holier thou"" bullshit. hilarious stereotyping people given website even subreddit made literally million people also actively participate. attitude ""everyone X, Y, Z"" makes look like obnoxious child. Get life. Well sucks. worked one emergency testing sites months lucky enough offer free. Honestly even got tested came back negative contract again. Symptoms concerning positive negative. Christ calls us love enemies, maybe I'd praying even harder. addition which, I've online 20 years I've made friends sides. It’s hard imagine think would running businesses. Wish fuckin' awkward bud. Lol. would think. Proof karma myth think dog he’s super upset alone liable pretty significant law suits, especially someone staff actually gets sick. rare cases vaccines adverse events. 

You idea rare is. What's caused recent explosion Autism? vaccines adverse events ""rarely"" Federal Government grant immunity civil suit establish national fund compensate victims? SOUND like something results ""rare"" adverse reactions. evidence vaccines cause autism. research started rumour fully discredited

No hasn't. covered subsequent studies rigged, see Hydroxychloriquin update this. broke rash inner thighs, inner forearms, stomach. It’s mildly itchy. also terribly stiff neck. Thought maybe meningitis, Lyme disease, possibly Covid. 

I think call sick tomorrow get Covid test. 29 hour delay fetching comments.

Sorry, engage civil discourse people demonstrably lack basic understanding logic resort ad hominem attacks (as deleted comment). essential worker, already feel traumatized knowing expendable am. ready nonessential. Whatever think Trump, he's right. US cases percentage population countries number deaths percentage population much lower many countries Europe. normally combative could people downvoted explain please?

If something say say it. 

“Youre delusional”

Okay how? havent done anything cry Seriously! Wtf wrong US (rhetorical question). dad came Philippines amazed able easily walk LAX California like nothing changed. article say going jail? Police bring people like ER mental health treatment time. cops usually stay long enough sign paperwork involuntary hold bounce. I've read countless scene dispos PD psych holds read exactly like article. Keep mind takes less time paperwork hold person book jail, person meets psych qualification one pressed charges, cop going instead. cases there's criminal record, private protected medical one.

You correct, however, probably get help. entire mental health system utterly fucked beyond repair thanks immense damage inflicted upon Ronald Reagan's omnibus legislation. profit psych care there's critical lack specialists facilities capable effecting good treatment. psych system ineffective revolving door.  Makes perfect sense anyone eating going bar wearing mask probably low concerns COVID. Maybe also report registered republican voters, may send beacon help president might want act. alberta 1-3 days usually results. Please beat US. I'm really sick people saying doctors US much better reason Medicare entire article economics. question non Americans think us incorrectly. viable option. I'm Canadian. Biden practically nothing healthcare pharma availability Trump would. Democrats compromised healthcare industry money.  absolutely need license revoked. getting business. EVER. Buh buh buh buh bih.... Muh freedoms!!!!! Well, think first time They're partaking risking everyone come contact with. like drunk driver worse. remember saying hope COVID seasonal, were, maybe politicians would actually something make sure resources fallback systems place prevent next epidemic, since wasting taxpayer dollars half-hearted measures go well happens often.

People come work school sick know they'll taken care financially.

People seek medical attention know bankrupt it.

People support lockdown government institutes programs make sure go bankrupt one.

People remain lockdown government cracks rulebreakers.  hard work shut virus.

I mean gave $2k month I'd stay home, aren't. yeah. I'd rather risk dying virus, later inevitable homelessness/ collapse. 

Idk people trying compare america countries ""successfully locked down"" cities higher populations countries. Imagine fucking stupid don’t realise economy going shitter regardless bodies pile up.

People stop spending, dead people don’t spend. know really gets economy going? dead people, spending total amount 0 dollars yearly.

They’ll sure getting economy going again! “But young people contracted virus, appear passed older, vulnerable population.

“There testing may account think we’re seeing true increase cases older adults, makes sense given overall large increase cases,” Cindy Prins, epidemiologist University Florida, told CNBC last week.“

they appear passed ...

that may account ...

but think we’re seeing ...

which makes sense ... 

No hard data, speculation. Speculates draws conclusion. “science” “data” keep hearing? No, it’s not. It’s conjecture. it’s EPIDEMIOLOGIST, it’s presented it’s factual. problem entire goat rodeo. It’s steeped opinion, substantive facts. Hey, fuck you. Also here's well deserved upvote. Genuine question, makes sub propaganda Best wishes you, mother rest family general, hospitals reserve ICU beds particular illness. Patients stack ER floor (the ordinary hospital beds) ICU bed opens up. Eventually ICU bed open ICU patient either dies gets well enough transferred floor. stuck ER floor needing advanced care bad situation. Critically ill patients need Critical Care doctors specialize treating serious illness. ICU nurses waaaay better average medical floor nurse, fewer patients per nurse monitor. 

As patients stack ER, means less critical ones doubled rooms meant one camping beds hallways. pretty common hospital even pre-covid whenever local knife gun club busy night. Wait times anyone needs stitches something increase 8 hours more. ER totally full divert ambulances hospitals still take walk-in patients. course, hospitals hardest-hit cities full, nowhere divert to. advice is, get sick, get car accident, anything might get shot stabbed epidemic eventually burns out. Could awhile. heard them.  Unfortunately experience research prove wrong, still think research better fits narrative want believe in. hope change someone's mind.   know individually, think countries handled virus better first place get vaccine handled poorly since countries likely poor job administrating distributing vaccine also. words screw reaction combating virus gonna screw vaccine distribution too. gets results, even fucked immoral.

No, doesn't. man always failure. Governor Cuomo put place mandatory quarantine (as leave house except emergencies) anyone coming hard hit states, get $10,000 fine. Anyone arriving airline fill form airport leave. NY means business. Sorry feel way. tough. really struggling I'd recommend therapy six months also cross fit one broke depression ADHD meds prescribed around time.

It's definitely going bleak awhile hope good support network. Let know need vent. autism vomit words sometimes hate see ppl pain. dm me. local drive-in recently played Jaws. thought perfect choice parallels. I'm sure true, another redditor said teachers tend shorter lifespans due issues get contracting many viruses. significant study contrary studies suggested Coronavirus transmission children rare. (e.g., backlog won’t stay isolated Florida. It’s already affecting tests Washington state. places use national labs. tests Washington sent labs far New Jersey processing. people dying results come back. result testing sites switching 40 minute tests. Hopefully don’t flat run those. 

United stand death rat Interesting numbers went weekend. lot times numbers lag weekend less capacity reporting/testing weekends pop Monday numbers get reported Tuesday. either they've pushed hard everyone working weekends even worse looks.

Marco Rubio also pretty delusional quote, even ever enough supply remdesivir hospitals NY state available standard treatment let alone enough massive outbreak entirety south country. lack medical resources entire reason everything kept decent control good government policies ridiculous ""learn"" can't moron open everything now. sounds like school extra steps? survival smartest Pray politicians work something week i’ll keep thoughts well. boot licking idiots say. mouth breathers problem. would great guys died quietly, unfortunately, infect others Actually, report said fertility rate dropping. population shrink. Women want make babies. means lower pay, losing career. means bringing child climate change world. 
There's also expected baby bust quarantine. that. fundamental that.

What really believe rights. 

So right shop wherever want store rights. right refuse bake cake gay couple customers rights.

Only rights rest us rights live rules.

A elegant way putting consists exactly one proposition …There must in-groups law protects bind, alongside out-groups law binds protect.” -- Frank Wilhoit.

But look perspective believe rights, actions start making sense. correct answer  Resfriadinho Upper Midwest, delivery grocery, many coworkers though - middling middle class - remodeling projects contracted around June. Instead playing real estate game moving one decent place next ""more decent"" place, they're remodeling. Yes. super easy say, yet observed population larger small town, probably true. relevant. general response could evolve pragmatically apparent limits resources. One us! think insurance company wants pay month hospital instead? flu shots free. almost every vaccine free? think malicious purpose. Rather, New York, lots doctors shared stories knew patient covid based symptoms conditions. But, patient tested negative. would run two tests - negative again, times. fourth test, patient would finally test positive. Lots cases like this. 

In early months pandemic, accuracy testing issue. So, test negative, doctors marked ""probable"" covid. 

Also, February, tested total 472 people whole country. Without doubt, people dying covid February, lacked ability test register deaths Covid time. California autopsies deaths January found pneumonia deaths covid. mean Canada went plan would move America.

Thats one way try get past visa denial. Dude making big brain moves. Someone guilty crime ask me. Yep. deaths - take week process death certificates. one wearing masks NZ paywall via adding . com URL. Bowie knives wasn’t bad IMO How's life 2016? came say too. Thank you. See, used think seeing Americans also failed learn lessons Italy, New York, local communities makes think even 100% cultural competency China, they'd still equally fucked. gatherings people outside household, including religious services.

Impossible. moment politician bans gatherings, including BLM protests, said politician automatically going canceled. Wtf it’s almost pointless get test takes 14 days. you’ll likely better hospital. end like Ischgl February (that austrian skiing resort Hotspot believed influenced spread within europe heavily barkeeper apres ski bar infected many guests different countries)

Well biggest issue Austrian local authorities certain extent central government hidden problem undeniable. ""basic logic"" flaws.

First, New York went strict lockdown \*once aware problem\*. early terms timeline outbreak, outbreak ran quite time knew it. estimates 1.2 million infections locked March 20. Florida currently estimate 2.6 million infections all-time. going follow New York's path, already double NY's death rate.

The simple truth New York's IFR going lot worse place's IFR ends being, places luxury learning medical trial error New York places gone through.  


Florida going bunch unnecessary death stupid, need compare NY comparisons going accurate.  Actual title: **Sinovac COVID-19 Vaccine Collaboration Butantan Receives Approval Brazilian Regulator Phase III Trial** It’s good concerned direct effects (ie: teachers) highly contagious disease, kids spread teachers, parents, grandparents, parents take workplaces, quickly escalate incredible amount deaths. know china locked Wuhan like extra long 

Is related like reinfection? always wondered locked superlong  Good, let suckers use remove mask mandate. I'll happy that. Trump's words worst enemy, republican mental gymnastics gold medal caliber. see hear anything, excuse outright real time. know say people. boyfriend live NY. works ICU nurse. April horrible. I’ve never seen exhausted. day told shit seen. running meds. choose would get them. Everyone belly’s wouldn’t even see face patient treating time move body. time full sores ventilators. normally treat dead body’s carefully respect. time case. threw onto truck. It’s pretty death apparently. don’t go quietly, scream, hallucinate, hear drown fluids. time die alone. One BF’s co-workers would try spend free moments holding hands dying patients. 

Our nurses going PTSD. seems like South decided that’s wanted healthcare workers well. really. numbers come they’re previous day. means cases reported Saturday. There’s probably delay another day well Monday Tuesday show weekend dip Florida. I, one, can’t wait Chad inside me. healthcare I'd recommend therapy well. 

For depressed lot life turns ADD causing it. focus, would lose clients got Vyvanse really made focus better depression mostly went away too... Though I'm still anxious lot I'm moping bed wishing heart attack something.

Edit: wish wait till 38... Feel life working past two years 40. believe dry air actually opposite effect. moisture droplets air virus ride airborne transmission Yes that's right, 9000 volunteers Phase 3 trial, starting Brazil today.

It's vaccine, vaccine candidate, hence phase 3 trial.

I hoping media focus western media today this, alas course would sort good news China can't that. Canada order enough syringes alcoholic wipes two doses Vaccines per Canadian. ordered vaccine order yet. Everyone home used time house projects. felt bad Home Depot employees. “My ignorance good expertise.” Telehealth therapy booming right interested. someone double removing office? don't, people believe masks tool fear control. I've seen people compare shipped auschwitz. I've seen videos pulling gun employee told put mask. dollar general security guard state shot telling someone come without mask. They're deranged lunatics. people don’t understand fit mask way wear mask wrong. using painters mask ensure shave skin. It’s bit top, feel safer playing gigs crowded areas. ah yes, insurance typically tied one's employment, astronomical out-of-pocket costs even deductibles. thought that? well, also people made decision wear masks. gonna support also？ “But it’s always there, like splinter mind” 

Thanks. People assumed COVID would magically fix itself, I’m fairly bearish prospects solving global air pollution anytime soon. mention polypropylene it’ll cracking, fracking, seals deal us. hope. awful way around. know son wasn’t attempting hurt family, ignorance did. hope dad pulls through. couldn’t imagine. Make sure loop 110% trusted make sure got law behind you, i.e., legally-binding agreement. takes one asshole parent violate pact infect everyone. (Yes, exist.) Without legal agreement, government police consider priority get coronavirus.  expected friends different. 😞 Looks like Paulding offering option person vs virtual. 70% parents voted send kids back Religion: successful virus know humanity  hasn’t declined then? Yep. another forum I’m guy furious rant media misinterpreting AZ’s death statistics.

Because yeah, it’s media’s fault real people dying states kinds fuckery numbers. Praying all. thought problem tanks contain non-medical oxygen. thought problem someone ventilator 

1. depending oxygen coming ventilator live
2. use oxygen much faster people go home ""on oxygen""

Which means need regularly swap tanks. swap tank time, person relying dies/goes braindead due lack oxygen. peer reviewed meta analysis effective masks are, spoiler: effective get compensation this? Competent leaders would set quarantine hotels (with negative pressure rooms) made available people reduced cost passing along savings wholesale rates state pays, potentially even subsidizing taxpayer money further. Make available residents returning state hotspots somewhere quarantine would avoid exposing family members. investment would pay many times over, necessity extra measures mitigate spread inter-state travel cannot restrict inter-state travel no-brainer. way years. pandemic exposed it. looking bright side. sedation feel slowly dying machine shoved foot throat tries breath you. Ants would roughly 0.01% discomfort point People people people! happens hospitals get overrun! don’t want get sick medical staff stretched limit. difficult understand? Wear mask. Wash hands. Stay away crowds. medical community obliged save life. Ethically? Sure. Practically don’t equipment PPE bed space? Nope. healthcare, high poverty rampant corruption.

Checks out. November/December probably mass rollouts start. Hopefully late. time respond right now, want point section address gap time. Samples sent WIV. facility built 2013 test samples. facility construction delayed 2018. Testing started time led virus escaping late 2019.  mean, good way get rid stupid supporters can't vote him. say, go it. think school thing daycare?  last straw you? Everything else fine, it? That's problem, telling people use masks HCP first priority issue. people understand this.

Lying people saying masks work clear evidence contrary changing narrative blaming non-Democrat group poisoned well.  Gee, wonder why? Chi-Raq they're desperately trying enough beds emergencies. Covid deaths old news catch imagination way someone hit car denied care does. Also there's still lot deaths caused non-covid related reasons. Well, things bad, yes. perhaps obvious way. research, facility question recently hospice care facility limited oxygen supply equipment. making facility covid treatment center, hospital able reduce exposure patients non-covid health concerns. course great idea, able meet oxygen needs quite bad.  Again, sorry, dont get mad basket Erie perch cold beer legit. love America. Canada great too. Nothing jealous of. Completely context. Back March 8, 144-500 cases US. Masks short quantities said given people actually needs them, frontline workers. Witht hat little knowledge virus time. Wow, I'm glad okay. Real shame kids mum, someone even avoid time guess.

Well fingers crossed vaccine comes us! None acceptable second demonstrate impartial exposure wrongdoing.

No one reason believe anything comment merit say this. like actually sourced anything either, gave internet claimed expertise. there's psycho's still, STILL outright protesting wearing masks minor inconveniences safety measures that's literally saving people nightmare know long term effects until... well, long term. shut society 10 years? corona virus started trending back up. Give time. woman photo carrying baby? That's looks like. Air conditioning appears good way recirculate virus, AC turned off, might better. public health principal called ""harm reduction,"" basically can't get people stop taking drugs least give clean needles. ideal, works, alternative worse. people get shamed stop wearing entirely, much worse. opinion wearing nose protect wearing mouth protect others (especially talking involved), adults allowed make choice. legit terrified happen rhetoric wins though, people stand it, many people thrown hamster wheel, enough bootstraps, cant believe say this, human lives important shareholder dividends. rich become disgustingly rich backs, hold us now, angry storm coming. Well simple, education came religious people religious schools example creationism vs. evolution serious debate teachers, principals parents strongly believing science incorrect, surrounded people belief science put minority, would lot anti-science. Yeah. Man. shit approved November! Here's latest death/case charts 7-day death curve still rocket launch. Yet seriously half friends high school Florida house parties, crowded beaches, block pool parties, restaurant bars, gyms, etc. want ""controlled"" government. Meanwhile realizing control government government killing people broad daylight..  think Trump gonna full 180 virus reaction, think starting realize ignoring destroying thing cares reelection.. Hopefully late.. God withholding miracles make Trump look bad. Every one always trying sabotage Trump. It’s Trump’s fault all. looks pacing lower Monday compared one week ago seems good. I'm certainly glad lower higher, you? People need realize death isn’t number understand getting at, much room abuse pass blanket immunity. could say ""well yeah write law minimize that"" say talking congress? Yes know fact. 

Coronaviruses weakness sugar crowns. sugar crowns important survival high heat high sunlight exposure speeds damaging/dissolving corona, disables kills virus. 

Many studies show average lifespan COVID-19 decreases heat and/or sun exposure increased. 

But we’ve learned crowding, masks poor social distancing weakness virus isn’t saving grace hoped would be. 

Come fall winter. maximum survivability spreadability. Paired kids going back school Americans inevitably deciding collectively celebrate Christmas Thanksgiving like isn’t pandemic happening. We’re primed bloodbath COVID-19 deaths. 

Hospitals incredibly used seeing ocean pink froth spewing patients mouths choke death fluids. User name checks go history along ""Slavery bad, can't abolish yet"" bad takes Economist years.

\*edit: word  WW2 caused NHS UK, load vets who'd lost limbs needed long term prosthetic care nurses afford it. national service started help them.

Maybe similar thing instituted US ex-covid patients need long term lung care. issue US fuck got mine attitude surprised crab-bucketted out. Anything includes everyone ""too radical"" anything includes subset ""unfair taxpayers use it(lit. help see it)"" Wow. Here’s downvote. Many come i’m sure. Yes. Studies June reported vast majority Covid misinformation social media pushed bots. E.g., state level actors.  Yep. days April awful seeing another 1,000 gone. like constant fear panic time case family get ill. take get shock think died ""There nobody patriotic me, favourite President!""

Is actual tweet guy, Onion? sounds like El Presidente bloody Tropico series.

Look, I'm British,and knowledge Trump fucking hilarious yanks managed elect him. I'm advocating masks. But...he seems cartoon man Agreed, medical laboratories actually store vials live viruses/diseases inside freezers keep viable testing, I'm mistaken. know Mexico, absolutely easy immigrate India US. lottery system H1s makes unpredictable too. Honestly 2016 good year baseball cubs top off. course blame racism, get fucking life. transparent y'all shifting goalposts ""long-term damage"" death rate inevitably falls continue grift fair, lot apartment complex’s pay things like water sewer. occupied apartment isn’t paying rent, costing money unlike empty apartment. people working unemployed spouses. make enough money even pandemic. hope educators see pay increase, value lives everything else. cant spend pension die get it. cant receive full retirement benefits catch disease debilitates point cant teach long enough earn them. Anything teachers stand lose will/can lost without strike/work refusal. dont know anyone could value pay rate life preventable scenario, hope educators see this. 

At point strike, teachers lose everything stand together. way hell state country take away every single teachers pension salary future; realistic would raise kinds hell across country nationwide movement. 

Doing right thing easy, look large scale strikes protest go. movement large every teacher state country would impossible ignore. one state manages it, see others following suit. I’d imagine Arizona ICU beds quite strained.

I would imagine waiting list people hoping get sent home. Living Europe saw first hand daily news happening Italy Spain, lesser extent Belgium UK. landlord also evicted, homeless person.

Which requires distinction. need know occupation. We're talking unemployed homeless people. former occupation one implied HoUsEd LanDloRd can't also evicted/homelss

I imply that. said center discussion homelessness homeless. Moderna pays $100 per session, $1100 total. Yikes, basic humanity Must due pesky ""alaskins"" Canadian citizen constitutional right live anywhere Canada, including Quebec :)

I've seen shit. gnarly shit oversea. never anything like this. Well interview yesterday literally said he'll keep saying go away eventually he'll right. Ask ""hoax"" even means. used mean something done humorous reason (at least hoaxer). think benefits this? thousands people would lying?  C R E many excellent analysis show public option would work, least well. many fearful since likely fail poorest using it, give neoliberals fuel forever say ""see, tried getting universal healthcare work!"". best option universal, single payer system incentivizes donor class make system strong effective possible, since would using system. Whether grows bigger outbreak remains seen, fact they're taking seriously *before* shit hits fan already puts miles ahead much US. truly cannot imagine horrible kept away loved one pass away... people see horrible disease is?

Not sure want bunch crooks imbeciles constructing ""new constitution"" cant even agree stimulus package thats overdue folks without jobs months. good see immune response, beginning - 

1. make immune COVID19? 
2. so, long? people need repeat doses?
3. not, get milder symptoms exposed coronavirus?
4. safe children/older adults/immunosuppressed people?

Good start, long way go fully assess usability. proud American? Seriously asking. I've heard Americans whole life say they're proud American, sounds like Americans brainwashed say time talk. thing many Americans treat flag like sacred. 

I'm absolutely proud American. US bankrupt need go hospital something serious. US puts hundreds thousands dollars debt want get good education. police power tripping maniacs commit crimes impunity. absolute joke president right now. 

It's worst country earth live in, there's really reason proud it. quarantine arrive take tests prove aren’t infected. I'm freelancer recently picked new client. first interview, woman interviewing told 1800 applicants 8 spots fill.

It’s general “I hate guy” side it’s holy fuck look start this, since I've said first post yet address it. **Where say 8,000,000 dollars article? know difference 0 adds?**

My next point is, know anything political agenda, fail see relevance has. 

This article politicized - simply stretching data infer things there.  loss 30 year old male female died car accident costing $800,000 economy logical makes sense. average person dying COVID aged well 60. **With 80% deaths aged 65+ United States.** point ""not contributing workforce"" almost entirely irrelevant. Average lifetime earnings adults graduate degree men ranges 2.68 - 3million according [this people graduate degrees, representative higher income brackets. Granted, lifetime earnings represent entire economic impact someone I'd imagine, zero chance we're close 8 million economic impact average person, let alone average person dying covid. also refer loss jobs federal subsidies. job losses part shutdown necessary, fail see plays cost death. Federal subsidies costs job losses economy argument yourself.



Furthermore argument ""the economy can't run without people"" strange, another strawman thrown in. seem quite fond method logical fallacy. 

Also - super impressed first sentence. trying engage kind meaningful discussion, save kind talk talking highschoolers. also protect idiots blatantly ""I'm still president even though lost"".  likely ""These election results say lost rigged, I'll stay president issue sorted out.""  Americans thought US couldnt get stupid , did.

This even self interest businessman brain do. Personally I’m pretty doubtful seasons if/when start actually completed. NHL best shot though, purely playing Canada rather US.

With said, MLS completed opening round tournament still moving forward know 🤷‍♂️ Makes think Kim Jung-Il quarter apathetic?  many people dont understand US government works aaaaaa Meh. much preening. following along suggestion Orange Marauder, ""Slow testing down!"" don’t think they’re smart enough understand they’ve betrayed That's concern likely wont rush everyone gets approved. Wait, people subreddit PROMISED work? people now? Theyve getting tested daily weeks need heres interview question. 

""LaPook, March 8: There’s lot confusion among people, misinformation, surrounding face masks. discuss that?

Obviously lol. get tested likely. also think sudden. pretty obvious happening people projected exponential growth things continued were. saying bad idea, utterly improbable. that, states Fed would pour billions, trillions schools nationwide things like update HVAC, provide proper PPE staff students, implement new standards cleanliness, possibly build new old buildings can't adapted...

Right now, Fed states balk giving scant millions year schools operate provide students have. less less people stay rural areas, property tax income deceases, thus school funding. on, on. Great news Finland. *cries American Exactly! Americans: ""let's see stupid still get it!""  Alright, let’s say last century. even close.

Guarantee Winn-Dixie executive made decision, soon boss man heard axed shit fast. reputation still tarnished though. Imagine believing country already excessively wears masks might curbed virus country fights refuse wear one.... Imagine POS anti-masker genuinely believes stripped freedom. That's little scary though. would imagine deaths delivery case. SARS-CoV-2, since infect domestic animals (cats, dogs, ferrets) thus reservoir eventual mutation might cause start new pandemic. important monitor viruses animals across geographic spectrum. Bats especially important since harbor least score coronaviruses. Yeah, sure madness. genuinely hope gf fine. Good luck mate! eat gun? blame them! 
Why put line fire!  bahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha Lol

Who think? Ok within last century. It’s like 20 years talking bar low. I've met cats dogs smarter idiots. know vaccine causes immune response...sometimes taking 2 doses. Also, clue actually prevents virus. prove prevents it...I'll excited.

Also, like 70% ppl experienced side effects...some fever chills.

I actually disappointed read it. Totally agree, lot media irresponsibility sensationalist, either due legitimate failure understand science deliberate manipulation make clicky story. Maybe think trying get people take seriously, distort facts process, undermine credibility also people's trust science, end bigger bigger mess. I'm glad Canada, pandemic handled. think bitchute officially truly understand. kid, mom told sister go play bother that. chose go bother mom, someone better bleeding. weren't, mom would arrange it. knew better mess mom busy. made mistake once. Mom would call us lunch make us clean table we'd busy. That's wondering sure, worry scope trying pandemic seems worsening. family run small business I'm deaf concern, want congress take balanced approach. currently enough jobs people going street soon seems like getting hung stumbling block really bad idea. would probably better quickly pass individual aid maybe temporary stay lawsuits figure best way handle them.

I'm trying civil reddit, getting angry yelling people doesnt get us anywhere. website sucks first glance it’s basically reads Florida 10% less hospital capacity NY - yeahhh ummmm born yesterday. Worldometer correct, USA due hit four million cases tomorrow. Well someone moved Europe January, rest family States hopefully get apocolyptic. uncle hospital 6 days covid, released last Wednesday. got lucky, needed oxygen intubated, nice hospital. knows care he'd get got sick week 2 later, really good insurance. I've guilty this. time, keep closed now. 6 months sounds drastic aside hotspots. didn't. interview taken context. basically says masks give people false sense pefect protection often people fidle it. says wearing masks, someone wants fine.

Yeah, like Florida. /s
Many countries increased capacity time. always resulted higher number positive cases. However, there's one country Europe among 10 highest positive cases twice cases June peak April Sweden.

-Masks improve health public
-Supreme Courts already ruled out. now, Malaysia considering make mandatory angry son? Yes came say this. 

They released maybe vaccine: yeah right state posted new single day high Sunday Look yourself...making sense stuff.... Yeah, deemed unsafe enough.

Particularly vaccine.

Worst pandemic 100 years get ""bailed out"" vaccine already development similar virus.

We learn shit prep next one. might put us even bigger creek silver bullet vaccine next time.


The next one might HIV type virus takes us decades get good treatments for. dumbasses saying ""it's flu"" ""No need worry. Vaccine 10 months things get bad"" $7.25 x 40 $290. four weeks month $1,160 even factor taxes deductions. look unemployment. taxes child support get around $600 per week. four weeks $2,400. make double ""essential"" workers make right now. People would literally work 2 full time jobs make current unemployment. morons think people go get job Kroger Burger King fine. need unemployment extended, need double minimum wage. Maybe find better paying job. boot straps?  Cant wait anti-vax fools this. Could gain traction like anti mask move. Part family already convinced grandma say never get Covid vaccine. Like dispatch federal agents carte blanche kidnap people American cities? late! that's always case. still get unsafe products sometimes. 

IF want argue safe, look established scientific protocols testing things well regulatory oversight. ignorant act like one else experiencing anything similar going through. situation far unique.

Let ask you, writing lashing others respond? point it? going prevalent everyone going know someone close died still care. They'll continue blame China ignore fact government letting people die

Edit: worth me. live Texas, wear mask keep distance. call C word, right faces. Magats realize can't free dead. 

But again, maybe choosing get infected dieing ultimate act freedom them. so, go it. Nope, I’ve actually paying attention 3 years functioning brain. first thing think see good news ruin everyone? Honestly mate people like reason usually steer clear subreddit. soon anyone posts anything good lot bombard often ill-informed criticisms it. Negativity gets us where. It’s important temper expectations also important shoot ever good piece info down. SOryRy TrigeRginG company hiring. counted less 150 posting small time operation. Everyone fucking lazy says there's jobs. would know looking currently? Well fair, restrictions could enforced USA. US see riots, masks. transportation halted prohibited people stay isolation centers forth, americans might see way living thread act uncooperative even worse.

Can agree timeframe? explosion dead bodies two weeks, admit bit overblown? I've hearing ""in two weeks going bloodbath!"" now, yet excess mortality causes tiny blip increase relative bad flu years like 2018.

But, uh, really effective police give shit feel anything better do. really funny people relying (for Austin least) protests 52 days straight. doesn’t get final call unless choses make final call hasn’t done

I think that’s OP meant thought common knowledge. going medical professionals first.  Unknown impacts unknown long term immunity. It’Ll nOvEmBeR fOuRtH tRuMp gEtS rEeEeEeElEcTeD!

Good luck getting Americans get haha corona apologist. Even flu vaccine makes feel weather couple days, can't lift arm head. beautiful couple heartwarming see. Congratulations recovery Mr Mrs England states U.S. mask mandates. Don’t lump us together. still people part. Roll healthcare professionals high risk groups first, everyone else follow. Probably care workers prioritised people deemed high risk Covid-19 due age medical conditions.  widespread vaccination likely be, earliest, next year even everything goes plan. sucks US. getting better. summer, beautiful out. People take advantage summer activities space spread outdoors. Instead people packing onto beaches bars.  Cashier side wore one...my side one wearing nose walked open side...kinda pointless her. big fans..yes nice blowing store like blocking entry unless masks worn. allow non filtered air blowing around high volume wreckless.  introduce hazard pay US truck drivers too. one thinking folks bring stuff country. Imperial College London always ranked top 3 UK no? Afaik American pretty much standard top 3 UK. Walking Dead That's precisely it? 

In April 2020, using masks sold Americans patriotic part good citizenship. MSM fell in-line blasted headlines: ""masks help"". 

You could argue behavior-modifying public health message conveyed well, many Americans trouble changing now-firm beliefs. might argue happened Trump, portion population sees Science never-changing, concrete reflections truth. mine regional Urgent Care 50+ locations. reason know lab got tired bitching basically told direct complaints company responsible. mouth can't even tell mask 3 Years tested enough EU. think really tried anything though. Oh wait... that's point. See that’s thing, gets tested regularly, staff get tested regularly wouldn’t surprised White House staff get tested wear PPE

Trumpy knows combat virus doesn’t give fuck  believe 400 million end year, countries could receive deliveries September. whole whack 2 months, that's begin administered dead! Fuck let cancel out. like they're rest country good anyways. ::scrolls furiously get part antibody production:: Sounds like someone WH turned bit. like someone would Bluetooth speaker. school 5 months. sheltered group. think confused OP saying trying debate kids spread virus gung ho proving that. hope right, seriously, know happen they've home time, congregating 500+ kids day returning families. pessimistic gets life, it.

Come christmas vaccine readily available, oxford university UK ahead everyone looks promising, youll see Yesssss kind news wanted today! HURRAH SCIENCE, WOO!  He's billionaire born millionaire family. can't even begin understand what's like live like average US citizen. He's touch reality lives echo chamber cabinet. embarrassing American right now.  live LA, seeing everybody know IG hanging people wearing masks makes want scream you. take L bro. lost  know new strand flu every year? There's new flu shot every year strand think going go around? would train immune system adapt never take another flu shot ever.... basically. 

Then take mentality apply many viruses. nothing better selective equality. order true equality work, can't pick choose include. eye eye etc.  I’m Brit still envy Britain long tradition producing excellent learning institutions daily new record tomorrow? I’m trying get hopes up, damn look good! vaccines Fucking hell that'd nice Masks mandatory Ohio. ceiling new reported cases due limitations backlog? “Sometimes old ways best...” *cue cheesy ominous movie music lol re-infection interesting. pretty much assume virus vaccine, best, immunity lifespan. say, vaccine won’t last longer catching virus.

From articles I’ve read, seems re-infection happen soon 2 months. clue average yet.

Even think people getting reinfected 2 months rare (we don’t really know yet), give 3x time, puts us 6 months. Combine short immunity people going refuse vaccine (I’m guessing around 30%, amount refuse masks), it’s pretty picture... guess see.  Yeah probably. Especially ""bootheel"" area actual swamps. limited amount free vouchers here. What’s sad even public health could give free! :( Great news start Monday!

Hoping best trials come, stay safe healthy everyone. mass produced starting Sept. take months widely available general public. published Lancet though... Instead stuck quagmire open/close schools discussion, kind thinking need of. 

Instead picking worse possible situation, i.e. cold winters Minnesota, looking adopting local circumstances. can't schools Florida Arizona Texas California held outdoors? Pitch large tents football field car park , hold classes there.  could vaccine need take annually I’m trying get hopes up, damn look good! different alleged minimums put forward here, main theme seems made money.

At time NC every single plan unaffordable. eligible subsidies carefully entering info. that's proof enough me, care people want keep calling fraud.

I ended getting full-time status employer buying actually affordable coverage them. I've moved since though. Tbh, reasonable actually wait 12 months see long term side effect. risk group, definitely take gamble Let them, natural evolution worked great far. talking ass yeah, public school teachers money /s *Eye Tiger intensifies...*  work DoD contractor pretty tough COVID approach. site 4200 people. 70% required work home.

Those site generally working onsite 2 days week. fillout health screening every morning entering temp taken every time enter building. way mask times onsite. We've 4 cases.

&amp;#x200B;

This morning early walking finance area. Someone printed bunch anti-mask signs posted walls. understanding this. zero chance would able find is. would likely fire person already fired people trying avoid temp stations. understand thought process anti-mask folks. Ill wait non-communist vaccine make appearance even wait bit see side effects might know late. Usually Vaccines take approved Ill pass rushed ones. US bought global supply Remdesivir licensing patent law, can’t produced generically Europe Africa. Even so, can’t buy haha yeah, once, maybe KID

*deletes ChAdOx1 accounts made 5 minutes reading article* someone explain what’s people claiming it’s “scheme” vaccine chip it? Corprus walkers low income people banking catching flu. :(  spring lockdowns? Yeah, time spent sheltered place squandered. Inflated who? republican controlled state governments Florida, Georgia, Arkansas, Tennessee? lying public, create world wide panic ok sake money? chance. think looking reasons wrong instead comparing actual situations transmission known occurred. “bias real” 
Says dude deletes comments get downvoted  like ""vaccine efficient without much side effects, gives lifetime protection can't sold 10$ US"" think kind funny. think kind sad. favorite explanation detection silent ischaemia save lives. Starting oxygen early, giving low molecular weight heparin, blood thinner, giving early antiviral drugs time detecting low oxygen levels save lives. would good idea every family buy oxygen monitor detect early fall oxygen, defined limit lower 92. believed India lowest Covid-19 mortality world due early detection silent hypoxia.

The article also shares interesting info oxygen generators oxygen concentrators. point, yes,it should. population dying,not struggling long term illness, negotiating way various always shifting phases ad-hoc lock greatly diminished public sphere eroding institutions negatively impacts every strata global economy functional -inasmuch one thinks before- solve preceding issues .

I wish sound strident crucial avoiding collapse world's dominant system one could well make argument citizenry paid get vaccine reduce holdouts anti-vaxxers. going lead countries keeping us vaccine it’s proven effective. guess already point. anyone National Guard decides enforce said orders Trump tells to? 

And since fired police sheriffs, people looting committing crimes since there's law enforcement stop them? Can’t. right mobility says neighbouring states fucked common cold caused 200 different viruses. Would pay good money vaccine one them? least Florida allow local governments close things mandate masks. I’m GA governor won’t even let local governments make decisions related controlling pandemic. closing anything except bankrupt businesses put people work.

Eventually re-open -- virus start spreading again. close...then reopen it'll spread again.

What's point? Let virus spread burn out.

People need get lives. People need work earn living.

Poverty kill far people virus could ever hoped. Except I've seen reports people re-contracting - develop long term immunity vaccine thing us forever. China may let cat bag, USA let run around neighbourhood screwing every cat sight going look good history books.  Please please please please.... hat's using ""we"". many people pointing fingers everyone else days. Yeah roommate dumb. business went would 100% happen die. die there's second chance, always open another business. schools essential kids regressing 3/4 months school...then teachers criminally underpaid critical?? short bahamas crash source income banning exact people support gdp. 

Expect requesting immigrate us guess? GSK back also said Pandemrix safe - based well known virus family (flu strains), whereas never vaccine developed coronaviruses. here, trust results test. assume sample expired long actually got tested. continue wonder, months, people think think feel everyone overreacting virus kills 1%. realize even get vaccine 50% people infected, 1% fatality rate 1,650,000 people 20% 50% Americans need hospitalization potentially hobbled chronic complications around 33,000,000 people. That's even counting ""mild"" cases experiencing long term complications.

Now, could find better treatments then. could also get vaccine reach point. we're really lucky evolve less deadly and/or disabling. miracles real, everyone start wearing masks whenever around people see massive drop infections. stands right now, there's way economy impacted, matter open is. And, someone chronic illness figure creative ways contribute economy, post illness conditions improve, COVID affect economy, workforce, medical system decades. also make sure get medical emergencies... Man...Costa Rica Uruguay seem like two bright spots. really hoping guys would ok.

Stay safe, stay well. always early Drump done selling hydrooxychloroquine (which work btw), he'll find ways sell vaccine jacked prices . long hydroxy sold, meds Americans. Dude, come on...don’t tempt fate. 3d printed ""heavy duty"" version masks boiling water soften plastic lets mold directly face. works great. wife daughter, air-tight seal. using ""premium"" make pads - pretty high-density cotton. 

That Thingiverse link also points studies showing efficacy various filter materials. studies appear match numbers people posting above. help top people trying discredit medical professionals. encourage optimism share it, thank reasonable discussion. normal California?  Better question often need get vaccinated...  stones — maskless — though... 
 
Imagine pissing store whilst maintaining eye-contact (and straight face). I'm kind inclined believe long-term immunity exists need invest invest invest over-the-counter treatments research lot republicans like Kemp. There's reason cheat get elected yet Deal loved all. Better keep open others. people gain keeping open fine mcmansions, folks funding always get fuck die. [I think mean would know? would know long term effects like auto immune disorders example? vaccine virus family never vaccines. ""intelligent woman"" caught virus joining Floyd protests without mask.   Hmm, sure agree. Let's rationalize this. 50% population gets vaccine works 50% time we'd expect 25% effectiveness. sounds bad. 1 4 immune would drastically cut viruses ability spread compared 1 100 people immunity. Sure virus would still spread number potential hosts would drastically cut. means would expect virus spread lot slower. 

Lastly, highest risk profile (elderly, obese, etc) would likely get vaccine first. elderly 15% case fatality rate, would dramatically reduce total deaths caused Covid. disease would still concern 18-30 year olds getting vaccine also dying rate higher risk profiles. Hospitals would overwhelmed way now. Social distancing working. world vote US election.

*Seven percent.*

That's needs convince. 7% American voters, key states. That's needs right reverse Biden's lead. convince 7% people already well-informed think choices way do. converted voting *for* Biden, they're voting *against* current situation. know virus impacted lives wallets Trump somehow. Trump goes TV announces saved day manages sell bs enough people, might get 7%. Scares hell me. Let’s blame governors. People also choosing continue life things normal.  Let them. states need shutdown prevent idiots traveling infecting everyone else. Yeah...it's looking good. Civil unrest seems inevitable; hope avoid much violence. food security issues looming. Ecuador, utility cut-offs allowed, pay 20% rent can't evicted. working poor getting desperate, universities open, students back streets like last October. enough problems destabilize country without virus. impossible say we'll year. want marry Karen? Wikipedia remembers part bringing Barry Alvarez UW-Madison. hated policies put place decisions made chancellor UW-Madison. know correlation equal causation but...c'mon...the whole damn Bible belt? That's coincidence, that's revelation country's future obstructed idiots think God-given authority stupid fucking can. weep good folk trapped there. You’ve watching many movies. 2 cops car. 6 cops, one choke hold, 1 hold gun yell confusing commands, 1 wrench arms another knees back 2 intimidate witnesses stop filming. OOOooo sick fuckin burn.

🙄 Guarantee close election work relatively small European country relatively anti-vaxxers compared America. guarantee would quite ordeal get people vaccinated. it’s willingness people importantly also logistics operation. simply compare ordinary flu vaccine, relatively people will. Check company called Serum Institute India. annually makes 1.5 billion doses vaccines world. already partnered Oxford produced close 300 million doses. trial works, immediately distribute around world doesn’t well company government India takes hit.

I find link post here. vaccine found part world. Serum institute India probably main production line it. Aight, I'm ready downvotes, I'm honestly shocked hivemind going far control. Wear masks, intelligent, I'm that. prevent spread, take precautions necessary.

&amp;#x200B;

But article linked estimate $800,000. $8,000,000. even close. Much lower. Beyond - representative general people risk COVID-19. think that's false equivalency, sir. 

There outliers younger die, that, outliers.  dig deeper, realistically, economic impact measures taken (which believe necessary, maybe necessary going forward - put pitchforks away) yet known. could well persist long time, change entire QoL middle class Americans going forward worse.

""Gotta pump numbers up. rookie numbers"" Well organic humans...soo....yeah. There's Nope, all. fairness, *snarky*... FUCKING Exponential growth takes little get going does, grows really fast. said guarantee herd immunity ever thing seems don’t maintain antibodies months. sounds like description Covid Party me. No, I'm calling out. call harsh could going ""White Lives Matter"".

Getting pissed someone uses UK refer achievements something predominately England (especially work Oxford Uni, across world) fucking stupid. Ask world British accent they'll go London accent. terms UK Britain tightly connected _just_ England worth calling 3 countries specifically achieve something they're forgotten someone uses descriptor ""the UK"". Crazy nurse thinks staffing company get away ""just"" Latinos dying there. picture dying Latino guy streams ants crawling body pretty gross. knew white privilege real, never dreamed went far. work oil company, drivers get 1 mask day (there's 8 drivers) office staff got 3 disposables back March/April. place work took covid loan spend 75% without punishment. office staff bought cleaners shared spaces management/owners got free supplied santizer disinfectant last month govt. set employees get access 1-2 pairs gloves day. taken cash whole time accept payments office.

Hold responsible. shithole country live in... hereby declare good ole USA fourth world country That's really good hear. forget Arizona closed bars, gyms, movie theaters June 30. Though lot people wanted closures, theoretically closures (plus masks) *some* impact now. looks like maybe are.  Cool idea, feasible lot places. even places work, might much pushback parents. reference point, least 17 deaths age 18 Honduras. Guatemala bunch child adolescent deaths including several 10 -- lest two literal babies.

Guatemala 1500 known deaths even single dead baby crazy compared many places. high risk 75 year old know says ""people can't keep dealing this"".  Meaning people go out. look like didnt go out, I'd take slow safe called zoomers Believe still travel UK yes? Hypothesizing modelling low-virulence strain (that one ever date described) without shred physical evidence like modelling unicorn.

*We predict countries cumulative infection levels could rise 2-3 times current level local-outbreaks, even absence containment measures.*

This prediction outlandish.

The mistery didnt spread rest China (it low level) SE Asia (it low level) best explained local societies handled tackled problem. Like example Chinese locking Hubei (less deeply) rest country.

This phenomenon (whose existence seems proven) also described modelled peer-reviewed scientific studies. rather surprised posted preprint ever reaches stage. Damn four months nearly 150k deaths in! world looks wonder revulsion covid 19 shitshow going 'Murca doubt. say something doesn’t make true. Missed :) might referring young people identify Democrats going bars hanging friends, even though informed virus. real story [we couple years politics calmed doctoral theses defended. Holy shit Florida! share winning rest us? It’s hard. get started. careful minority. Masks psychological social cost actually. mouth plays important role body language conveying emotions. restricted ability talk, visual communication suffer. everyone constantly wearing face masks also constantly reminds pandemic going on. good one hand encourages caution, hand also emotionally draining causes feelings anxiety dperession. there's people feel muzzled cover mouth. feeling personally share, understand come feeling like suck.

Does mean wear masks? course not. token get annoyed people say ""it's minor inconvenience, stop complaining"". not. real cost, acknowledged much right now. think pain grief wear mask acknowledged actually encourage least people start often, good thing. going burn people cannot fight it, like new york. He'll probably sell it. Damn sucks. freshman senior based ages. football teams rivals. End madness ... hard ... wear mask ... social distance ... wash hands. would hope special ape smarter virus. think they're processing all.. they're letting pile big stack! 🤔 oh yeah awful Britain brought light civilization half world! time Royal Navy single-handedly ended Atlantic slave trade? evil  New York, deaths attributed pneumonia 651% March 22 April 11. counts 670% New Jersey 172% Michigan. three states reported 7,430 pneumonia deaths typical 1,419.

Now TX, CA, FL AZ affected, think they're anything different?  dad cares you. think idea using IL-7 vaccine would work well. However, know IL-7 works better adjuncts currently used vaccines.

But, think report potential therapeutic. suggesting competent cell compartment, SARS-CoV-2 patients would better chance decreasing viral load preventing cytokine storm. Here, suggesting method determine cell competency. So, cell compartment blunted numbers loss function, perhaps IL-7 would reverse this. yet many people think Hoax. see eyes still refuse see shit killing people. baffles mind everytime. cannot believe it. Best luck you. know didn’t like this. power chose this. ""I'd like beer people r/Coronavirus""

\-Nobody ever Well, that's one way get secular country guess. don’t believe thought true. Even Faucci admits PPE short. I’ll never respect another word mouth tweet. anything emboldened thought masks work backwards ass administration says don’t. understand HIPPA laws regulations, nurses need get picture there. I’m talking gnarly overpacked hallways patients, freezer trucks bodies. Video rooms full patients ventilators. way deniers change mind. Families Germany, staying convo. July 17 letter, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said would unconstitutional force religious schools follow recommendations health authorities reopening schools pandemic, said may decide “when safe communities resume in-person instruction free government mandate interference.” 
   private schools therefore need comply local public health orders contrary,” wrote.  
  
Curious things religious places ignore legally?  Jesus tap dancin' christ Hey now. show numbers facts prove wrong. Makes mad. see sub still downvoting factual information agree point view. There’s already US vaccine starting phase three trials next week. testing 10,000 people need run 2,500 batch tests. 10% come back positive, 250x4 individually test, total 3,500. really helps situations overall number cases low, top comment chain stated. Rawnada great job containing coronavirus.

Rwanda makes western country response look terrible. 0.4 deaths/1M Rwanda vs 4 deaths/1M New Zealand remarkably good. Early reports, might changed time source Lancet reputable source :) stand corrected! 18 days since first symptoms is.

By way, triage literally choosing treat based resources available. treat everyone, usually treat everyone West (except Resuscitate (DNR) yeah, ICU beds full usually stop admission cases elderly case Covid. lower chance survival, morbidity afterwards use ICU longer younger patients. 

So guess what's happening South Florida right Great news. test them? I'm agreeing disagreeing yes. believe we're somewhat page. chapter least... understand everything explained works, post venting guess asking happening. came across it, I'm not, again, mentioned original post, reading previous post tell we're close this. CHINA!
 -greatest POTUS ever. /s would strike chord. job pays *less* making unemployment damn fool take it. That's abuse. That's math.

Most people claiming wonderful jobs available lying teeth. paying less folk make unemployment acting surprised one wants shit job. parents relying money. brother lives let go didn’t qualify unemployment. Fortunately dad qualify $600 paying rent bills. it’s gone pretty screwed likely get evicted lose car. sucks wish could help can’t afford it. really hope something passed soon really need it. good data party affiliation predicting willful ignorance? Oh look article saying opposite! could day Read approaching herd immunity NYC, Spain, Italy, UK subside. Teachers power right now. would urge unions take similar action, strike refuse return school. worth life, families lives, students lives. think kids run schools, drive busses cook lunch well? picture guy supposedly ants.... shirt back, covered blood? arm looks bruised?

I'm skeptical. Morgues big hospital, even hospitals ""about full"" else think bodies stored? NY outbreak finding dead bodies trucks cause nowhere store them. Italy like outbreak. again, surprised. gubment. That's precious. undeveloping nation? 2016: Tourists afraid Puerto Rico Zika

2020: Puerto Rico afraid tourists Covid lucky enough boss let take unpaid time know better, 

Fuck that, boss feel lucky retain worker without pay sick leave. sooner life goes back normal, sooner keep making billions. least finally decide eat them.  Also, point 0 reason shouldnt testing need. People able rapid test daily desire, sports teams able operate without burdening system....Hell, isnt even system strategy. 

That's stamp stuff out. would wise investment. 6 years younger me, wild. Always feels extra weird hearing people younger dying. try much like, can't stop you. However I've never been, offended you.

You try 2 way communication though.

 Ill leave this, thanks insight good luck kind stranger! Public health care. profit. Single payer. Now.

Say laser cannons, say yes first world health care all. Well, option lot schools. outdoor space climate reliably. well, even places done, would probably lot pushback parents students. [It's page thought vaccine scheduled June Chinese one though. Given much anti-vaxxers love questionable anecdotes, could actually increase compliance. Here's thing. Omce shutdown March initiated, serious plain day. people ignorant want right way mind change get it, close loved one (because side family even matter now) gets it, either one find they'll die it. Ridiculous country living year. sub /r/politics coronavirus sprinkled in. Don’t come facts, go /r/COVID19 that.  thats beyond bad. sorry patients, nurses doctors staff.

and yes walk out. put life stake one back? even anti-maskers talking ""bad air"", straight 14th century! Next it'll ""ill humores"" ""jezebel wynches"" obvious, ? Money I’m guessing ? Obviously unimportant asshole. Die rich jerks bank account 'Murca. tired winning yet? Chambersburg shithole Accelerated devolving CoRoNaViRuS CoNtRoL 

-The President United States Donald Trump herd immunity flu - ie heavy Influenza virus strains, less severe ones cause colds. flare up, bunch people get talk town while, like everybody gets lots people mild reaction.

That's herd immunity looks like. Even vaccine rushed early 2021, would still need ramp production millions. Even then, long think antivaccers, antimaskers, long term trial awaiters take it? 10,000 per day around capacity test. backlog huge growing, actual number rate growth may much higher. what? florida. mom died funeral home handled state certificate within week. arguing us fascist nazi germany, lmao
calm bruh  *please Texas...* **please** *don't Texas*

[clicks link]

CALIFORNIA?!? say so!! shuffle test smaller sample extrapolate total number expected cases... like polling. Yeah. Covid would pre-existing condition. person replied said.  think downvoting UK exceptionalist viewpoint

But that's valid viewpoint here. scheme, member states control prices, able source deals. ""we think could better"" ""we're already ahead""

We've got 200 million doses order. We'd scrap join scheme. 30% make much noise 70% easily heard. Took somebody know , ok wife, 18 days get negative result back Colorado. Pitiful. Ugh, remind me. Buncha idiots, lot 'em. lot places ""non-urgent"" medical procedures postponed pedant human absolutely dog fight. underrated comment “if”?? Fair play, bad. starting now. largely present EU &amp; US since February/March. real way tell fucked place looking positive test rates. Ya brothers outside Houston wait 10 days. Test came back negative wrong get retested. Next day (max 72 hours) UK Well, yes, see side: care people dont know? Maybe way from, grew people telling me: always look first survive. got elected, so... live past climate catastrophe

if that, looming biodiversity collapse separate, made worse climate change, would want immortal... big question moment. yes answer. 

Seems happen .... common?

Over time frame ? 1 month, 2 months, 6 months....

With reinfection, would weaker stronger condition second time around?

What asymptomatic mild cases opposed severe cases. difference would immunity chance catching again?

Many questions subject. cases people thought Covid hoax, wear mask, social distancing others, etc... later contracted covid? I'm curious ever happened. quite wonder compare relatively close country like Indonesia, nearly identical weather pattern, shows correlation virus spreads. Spillover Florida wearing mask.   astrazeneca That's problem NHS Scotland it. Apparently working NHS England. NYT reputable site. post definitely bombarded bots something. 

This specific incident isn’t genocide. Forced sterilization ethnic minority qualify cultural genocide according ICC. Uyghur birth rates Xinjiang dropped 85% three years.

Here’s another resource want learn more: Who's we? alone one. count asymptomatic cases separately. asymptomatic carriers start showing symptom count confirmed case. Every time people say OK people die economy remain stable, ask let family die first.

People like say bullshit see people dying statistical number instead something happen them. They're covered germs. half doctors wash white coats less week, good percent wash less month. Belts ties also super disgusting. culture, like see doctor button tie lab coat hygienic. wear scrubs instead. Scrubs tight-fitting easily withstand cleaning high temperatures. news first broke joining scheme. People saw ""EU"", assume great thing apart rejecting terrible.

Equally, 3 months ago programme started, could see benefits joining. something we're actually ahead EU on, joining scheme would massive step backwards. Nothing Trump. Early 2021 believe vaccine ready. Isn’t Resident Evil plot line? go again. make everything China look bad. That's hometown (am Europe now). good hear people sensible! mean, *maybe*. I'm mental health professional want make mentl health determination based news article. 

I mean, hell, least piss floor. articles people pulling guns masks. I've read least one article someone getting *murdered* asking customers wear mask. might mental illness, many people also self-entitled assholes. tell difference? Yeah dick went deep. Also, go back statement millions won’t die. Assuming everyone New York infected, death rate 0.375%. That’s lower bound. absolute best, everyone gets infected, 1.2 million die.

You truly believe 10 million dead better economic collapse? fathom economic effect 10 million dead? 5 million? I’m going argue anymore believe level stupidity can’t fixed. 

You STILL haven’t provided one shred evidence claims economic collapse single reason numbers came with. Sweden better track since end June excuse acting incomplete information early adapting. (Still, rest Scandinavia chose different approach time).

Some things probably work better Sweden US - benefits stuff ensures people stay home sick. it’s politicized. think downvoting UK exceptionalist viewpoint.  Distributing vaccines within framework larger bloc, means frontline workers vulnerable given vaccine priority across various countries.  Rather one country trying buy everything, people high priority, key workers countries miss out. Sometimes media schizophrenic relation Russia. One day Russia stealing data West develop vaccine RussPharma sucks next day, Russia working vaccine already April evil give elites whilst scores people die streets. Doubt permanent immunity. already news patients recovered getting virus again. could go NY, NJ get test come back faster that. :/ wife “Rapid Testing” tomorrow Jacksonville. One drive-up tests results 2 hours.   Covid actually makes underlying conditions ones finish people off. Covid blame, directly, particular action. Doctors usually report main cause, comorbidities, guess Texas doctors wrongfully ignore report comorbidity main cause. misremembering?

You’re misremembering. expected timeline COVID-19 vaccine approximately 2 years.

In general timeline vaccine several years decade. speed COVID-19 vaccine passing initial stages seriously fast. 

Now article - there’s sources. There’s Telegraph news article hidden behind paywall there’s large number online news websites copied article mostly verbatim provided absolutely context quote “absolutely track” from.

To person downvoting comments thread - facts.   Gorsh.. italy 24/48h delay.. Yes, happens time Sunday less deaths reported weekdays. true situation improving. Maybe next Sunday zero deaths. spit other's mouths singing ""proud American""  Makes sense. Weather issue though. Again, poll parents, students ""pediatricians"" sufficient warrant re-opening schools. One Youtube video cut either. Trump could hero story. Open Trump Tower medical staff essential workers NY epidemic. Closed borders, Enforce DP Act make masks PPE, gave free PPE Americans name it. no. listened Putin, Miller, Devos, Jared. Trump said nothing, 2 million would died. going 3 million 2021 current R0 trending R3. Expect Trump blame everyone else number. remember, it'll number him. give damn dead people. would go ship never wanted anything with? means good news. solution ages ago. proof would work kids teachers put danger. What's boggling mind anti-common sense. share well, seems like getting share some.  Maybe, businesses/people actually spend money. Arguably GOAT Golf player so... freedom listen medical advices doctors worth ? need 6 vaccines now? mutates regularly. got many plans I'm gonna COVID! alive, always fail start new business. Entrepreneurs tell failed number times succeeding big way. It’s odd American hear give death (or better, give someone else death) failed business argument. Must new American way, else live Animal Farm misremembering old way. Sword Art Online virtual lockdown everyone restricted ever going back bodies. several co-workers posting social media media fear-based, etc., can’t wait go back school. course, ones have, there’s one didn’t already think kind idiot anyway... would (as Czech) enthusiastic using Czech Republic example. country ""complied"" people took opposite extreme stance: weeks required wear mask anywhere, including alone open country people would look out, search people without masks woods call police them, batshit insane. health anymore, people's desire snitch brought worst people. schools reopening 6 half month old coronavirus? little. 

However linked ACTUAL opinion licensed pediatricians above. miss part? Pull race card Keisha! governor's attitude change real quick! America truly shit hole country run idiots. Can't even basic maths. Popn UK 66m know many people die covid? not? What's reasoning? Ah, see guys saying now. looks like CDC suggest mask use/asymptomatic spread month Fauci said (""for health care providers people *ill*"") attempt prevent panic buying, guess ignoring evidence countries. articles suggesting asymptomatic people still contagious even hit states, prepared instead downplay. Super backfired way president others still citing statements reason mandate today. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.  also number cases include vast majority never detected, elegantly ignore doomers do.  Karen. children forced go school, think needs reported. /s I'm disagreeing EU system better overall. Hovewer, need proper discussion omitting largest tax revenue makes conversation dishonest.

EU VAT instances bigger US sales tax - lowest one Luxembourg 17%, even 27% Hungary. 
In country, Poland, overall public sector income VAT nearly twice large income tax. Saving sick time weird concept me. Can't imagine limited sick days. think virus goes away Trump loses election? Thats actually good way described there....


We call tax, it’s deducted taxes even get money month. Florida makes sense. Thanks adding another New York population 8.4 million people. 32,000 confirmed covid deaths New York. Even EVERYONE New York infected, death rate lower bound 0.375%. Americans infected, 1.2 million would die. death rate may lower 1%, it’s definitely higher 0.375%. USA! USA! USA! dumb ass makes feel smarter think smart people dumb COVID19: Delicious. dying. lot people, like really huge percentage, damaged life real burden economy. whole nation weakened. Idk Americans give willingly country death misery Probably within year saw buddy, take upvote lol feel like ""they"" relatively new brand people? get ""they"" always here, decades past ""they"" carcinogenic. 20's partially defined ""them."" hope fully. Follow Occam's Razor: simply pandemic meets fucked US leadership, mixed political bias, arrogance ignorance. think n95 masks do? plan visiting anytime soon? Weird question parents old keep wanting come/come live like 5 hrs away shit around people late August beginning September I’m afraid something happening then, I’m also terrified giving them. I’m loss miss know miss more. Ah shit right. Thats gonna story, governments fault refusing mandate masks, gonna kids fault going spring break drinking river 4th . millenials already killed cable TV industry rotory phones they're killing great grandma socializing actual f----- Understanding mean shit we're running low remdesivir means treatment. 

 some, assume, good people Well cases keep going up, going beds save anyone. 500$ vaccine US, 10$ Canada maybe clear burdens healthcare killing seniors feel bad, initially thought poster meant went webpage view count donut site, possibly representing page crashed/down due data unavailable WH took data. reading second time realized prob meant donut goose egg zero.  were. numbers started going DiWine saying ""oh geez guys better start better"" actually anything. Fucking unreal. ideal solution teachers teach online home, encourage every family able online learning home so, hire low risk young adults (18-24ish) babysitters actually sit classroom students absolutely cannot stay home also learn online laptops. would require money, though, schools US lacking. way didn’t mention reply quoted article says first doses ready September. slightest idea takes distribute sample something millions hundreds millions people? Let tell process delivering something population 10 million: takes months preparation multitude time distribute make sure everyone got it. I’m third world country. I’m trying wedding September, (live California family there), bad things?? I’m getting really nervous shits really bubble there. Besides, people fucking delusional think active pandemic killing people going negatively impact economy business irrespective whether government orders shut not.

What really US government step save/bail big businesses crisis give shit small businesses private individuals. sane world, country would shut steps would taken ensure many people possible lose nothing blow absorbed could weather financial impact COVID-19. expendable let anyone ever tell are. join teachers say, fuck school shit safe. people want say safe need forced stay classrooms teachers then. good you, good them. ""It's 1000 people per day, shut people???""

God hate people like that, deaths seem like numbers them, people family, people care them. cons finally getting isolation they've wanted years  work victims natural disasters literally lost everything own. one thing come back “I’m alive that’s matters”. Yes, it’s devastating. No, everyone recover point before, always thankful survived. Sadly enough, that's 100% it. knows masks mandatory. given decision vacuum, I'm sure he'd make it. makes mandatory early, hardcore con - servative base abandon far - right dema - gogue.

There's right answer account immense stupidity American public. tired read “wall wall old obese boners”

I think still works. I’ve conversations too. People argue points heartless. Second wave everyone except USA. still midst first one here. let honest really understand pandemic precautions bother True! sure! bizarre, tactically predictable. That's really gets me: Republicans win, life gets worse everyone. Democrats win, life gets better everyone.


Just shut fuck unless want say ""thank you"" affordable healthcare finical security. virus legs, float air little while, sit surfaces, dies own. way lives jumping person person. can't transmitted, can't spread die out. easiest cheapest way wear mask. seems republicans guilty collusion corona virus helping spread. Looks like using playbook Russia scandal trying change facts, claiming hoax downplaying severity pandemic. people think herd immunity good solution aren’t going comprehend bad side context. Six years flooded hospitals constant resource drains wouldn’t mean much them. Central Valley?  probably want land back all.*

The land belonged Oirats, exterminated Uighurs Qing Dynasty. southern states fucking new york. shit cant open pace cause soon people south/southwest gonna bring virus back new york Well everyone knows older people likely vote red. Probably version voter suppression.  look what’s happening Democrat cities... NY swell. Defund police, murders crime up, shocker. obtuse? point, Democrat voters suffering consequences actions. 

This isn’t “Republican” votes. Ca stricter restrictions early states know? They’re shut bc “high” Covid numbers. can’t indefinitely shut country virus deadly people don’t even know it. Interesting, right? Wake up, sheeple. Legit friends lots [S n_d e r s] people. legitimately dislike [n e o_l b s] much [c n_s e r v v e s] they're biting tongue voting time lesser two. madness needs stop, protest [n e l b s] stop equivalent 9/11 every couple days.

Sorry words, trying avoid [a u o_b n] terms sub. order put gag, usually sort mouth covering. essence governor forcing mask mayor. hypocrite... LonelyWanderer either misspoke that's typo.  completely disagree everything post. going change others opinions think. We've discussed full view article video, think probably can't really go further. Considering study several others found elementary school kids spread virus less often adults, think totally worth studying. 

US society ridiculous though, doubt that. many Floridians tourists Essentially way vaccine works adenovirus - mild cold virus would teach immune system fight coronavirus. However issue traditional approach antibodies reject adenovirus well next time given, meaning booster shots aren’t effective.

[Source (in paragraphs ""undeserving"" accurate remember movie theaters??? Move. Honestly waiting working FL since many people ruined chance keep bay business always right kick reason Neither I.

I’m loss what’s going happen mom I’m trying freak out. hurts see pray schools reopen it’s big risk especially older teachers anxiety roof; past two weeks personally know 5 people others waiting test results. It’s spreading like crazy South Florida faith DeathSentence right thing Florida 911 dispatcher here. They’re skewing numbers reference deaths infected, public taking warning signs least area, stamped people dead, people go hospital, substantial uptick calls reference well confirmed infected patients, 911 Dispatch Center, temperature checks optional, maybe two three people shift 20 wear masks, first responders/Law enforcement officers come dispatch center. ship without captain, ship rudder. Pray us

Edit: [for saw talk deaths inaccurate, guess onto something Im surprised. I’m New Mexico wife got laid $200 would’ve basically nothing. 

I know people spend groceries family every week. Imagine beech front properties couple months going auction. Less more.

Maybe trump planning purchasing building casinos hotels. He's got perfect retirement scheme going right gets voted out. Georgia close literally 1 day reopening? I’m scared. Looking saving seeing long survive it. I’m wrapping head around kids bringing home giving classroom students health issues. 

I 15 days go in. car outside stolen goods another store it. You’d think one thing would want thief would low profile possible. Pissing floor achieve that.

Obviously drugs, surely thief would delighted chance wear mask? Even high thief would realise that. moron downvoted. put economic value lives losing. losing great grandmas nursing homes, ain't earning shit Yes, I'm speaking broadly, getting edge cases could probably manage necessary. really mandate vaccinations *adults* US, I'm sure could ever work without protests craziness would make past month look tame. looks study, first I’ve seen sufficiently large sample size, almost people covid never even sick enough go hospital disabled life.

The sample size people experience long-term symptoms. interpreting incorrectly. countries gained local elimination without vaccine many gained suppression. 50% effective vaccine tools disposal, many countries able achieve local elimination. Countries can't manage shut rest world pretty strong incentive.

3 month immunity intelligent governance need eliminate it. Placer county really outdoing week. Honestly... I’d give lotto win means world relieved burden COVID. pulse oxymeter, make sure tests regularly. shelf ones foolproof, dips 90 below, know need get someone properly check pronto. us wear masks, never go hate DeSantis. :(  family working leave soon possible. That's appeal authority fallacy is. look up. really should. Slow relative term exponential.

Coronavirus disproportionally affects elderly :( I'm sorry loss, that's incredibly sad. wish people would right thing mask up, distance stay home whenever possible. *Not hard work. Yeah, pretty dumb. already know weekend numbers artificially low reasons nothing spread virus, can't/shouldn't trusted accurate representative sort trend direction. posting record day asinine. gonna absolutely tear dance floor wedding next year 🤞🤞🤞 think current death figures really people died months ago?

Doesn't make sense people dying ones hospitals now? Specifically ones ICUs which, places, full canceled elective surgeries free resources. Hahahahaha bunch animals. assumed normal question when: 1) half life antibodies around 4 months. means everyone else planet need booster 3 times year. 2) won’t required freedom choice. 3) economy falling faster pushing fastest vaccine developed history humanity- nine years. So, nobody tell going get better it’s probably not. mean it’ll massive let people die, shutdown government doesn’t step up? Kemp

If, however, single person saw mugging, they'd likely intervene, sharing blame/responsibility nothing happens.

Effectively, takes effort something part group alone, due natural tendency share blame/responsibility among members group. “reopen” crowd doesn’t even business, want sit Applebee’s go bars. 1 leaf tree. Soon go away Free country huh??? That's unfair. bullshit rule.... believe it. know one 75 year old person would leave apartment started. Doesnt open curtains. shelter place started everything everyone else's fault. older people know trying safe. I've posted before:

I've thinking COVID-19 par Spanish Flu we're getting COVID IFR around 1% modern treatment.

The 1918 flu killed around 5% infected, time health care basically ""you'll get better die"". 1918, oxygen support, much less ICUs, monoclonal antibodies, dexamethasone, anticoagulants, immune modulators, antibiotics secondary infections, etc. own.

COVID putting 5 - 10% people hospital. minimum, that's 5% infections oxygen support exist 1918. people may ""OK"" (for value ""OK"") long term without oxygen, doctors going put oxygen think risk suffering death. believe significant percentage people requiring hospital care today would died 1918. everyone needing ICU care today would almost certainly died 1918.

Basically, COVID, we're seeing untreated death rate within ballpark 1918 flu, added bonus infectious disease. We're able fight better medical care keep lethal.  Study: humans first names beginning A, P, L transmit coronavirus effectively humans first names beginning R. quote trump, make point attitude minority here. friend former military (now nurse) best shape I’ve ever seen anyone - immune issues, 40 - got absolutely leveled. It’s three months still gets tired going flight stairs, can’t taste anything etc. Obviously people immuno-compromised gonna hard time, hit really healthy people hard too, that’s scary hell. I'm optimistic cautious also. Smart lockdown appears worked, Eid coming up. hope everyone stays safe. Fuck Greg Abbot

I'd rather you. Why? ""We NeEd ClOsE DoWn""

No shit, sherlock. Meanwhile, WHO’s official global numbers show USA 0 new cases. Guess that’s end transparency. even worst case scenario ""only"" 1.2 million americans would die. million, millions. know that's happening. mean... urine sterile, right? guess there's that... I'll guess know came from. 🤨 I'm texan get mentioned, coincidence textbook manufacture means text books schools across nation. (California lets school districts decide book use, Texas, next largest state, decides state level, nearly publishers include texas educational standards try texas choice. least, that's way early 00's) 

A quick summary white people flooded texas early 1800's sleepy backwater provice Mexico. Mexican government tried assert authority, Texans rebelled. Mexico early victories Alamo Goliad, Texans caught napping San Jacinto independance. years country, Texas joined US, Americans straight invaded Mexico show force/land grab. 

I learned adult main dissagreement Mexicans Texan whites slavery. Texans brought slaves them, Mexico abolished slavery. Texans straight stole state made country could people, joined US, invaded Mexico, eventually fought confederacy. pretty shitty around. median age hospitalized continue rise. idea hermetically seal vulnerable laughable. doable. 

Whether old people homes actual homes, elderly depend coming contact younger people, everyone, everything medical care, mental health issues simply food family.

It's bit like people wanting treat prison populations separate, parallel tangential overall population. case. COVID ripping way prisons jails, number people either infect people work (and therefore interface outside world) sentences leave. 

You can't section people entirely. COVID general population, higher chance we'll see cases old people homes ravaged it. I’m OP may American like absolutely fed lack leadership. wish would taken seriously much rest world would have. Instead, people ignoring people die. Best luck Aussies. Covid late March. took 5 weeks felt fully symptom free. I’m 30’s. type 1 diabetes got kid. I’m high risk category. cough hung around off. lingering breathing issues inhaler wherever go. chronic fatigue really hard part. find difficult simple task like going get groceries without feeling completely wiped afterwards. I’ve also noticed I’ve handful migraines isn’t usual me. best advice give stay hydrated, drink lots water. appetite, try drinking broth bone broth, popsicles, instant mashed potatoes (I say instant it’s easy), bland soups, black coffee one thing could almost taste. Otherwise try get sleep whenever find TV show binge watch. wish luck hopefully get without many long term effects. testing rate convincing.

its possible, however.

overall US, positive rate stagnated maybe even dipped... compared previous 3 weeks steady increases. Lol. deserved it. outbreak, city gets locked controlled, tracing apps Europe, masks indoors since march still enforced.

Now open subreddit look US news many ppl refusing wear mask deciding masks indoors worn? Yeah go, start get page Europe, also nice things. seeing people think masks freedom, dont think go smooth here. Wow...just wow🤦🏼‍♂️ Central banks printing money governments. designed able this, order avoid another Great Depression. one brand new tested minimum possible safety requirement. might even get dispensation safety requirement balance social benefits

This totally untrue. vaccine development 5 years already proven totally safe. modified slightly work Covid instead MERS. opposite rushed. risks almost certainly lower catching Covid. blindly following advises bureaucrats might accept higher risks health do.

This true either. data trials available make fully informed decision. first set data published today.

If want disregard this, free so. nothing logical position. Best reality TV show ever.  There’s def more. results people cared get tested. doesn’t include ones haven’t. democrat heavy areas Trump could glided re-election simply handled like adult; listened doctors strictly followed advice, would encouraged republican governors same. Instead got Taj Mahal/trump U response virus. Pandemics kills way terrorism. Maybe family gets covid barely comes back brink death he'll see things clearly. wondering subreddit in. Antibodies fade within months Well grab one scientists who, start outbreak:

1. Said ""masks work"".
2. Also said ""1.5 meters enough social distancing"", AND
3. Caught Covid-19 ""recovered"".

Then put Pub / Bar / Nightclub / Party / etc... known Covid-19 hotspot, see go theory, eh?

Then find out. I’ll wait bit see turn resident evil monster first Also rich Driving commercial airliner 2 buildings full worried economists.

Nah, one happened before.....  soooo happy Canadian. Especially last 5 months. Trump gonna throw hissyfit realizes America save world like movies lollll boot taste? *Martha Stewart typing* “Experts agree won’t know whether reinfection possible virus us years, rather months. 13 million confirmed cases worldwide limited anecdotes possible re-infection, far large-scale series cases re-infection occurred – somewhat reassuring sign.” Thank u. Screw msn fox stupid clickbait titles I'd like popcorn buttered hydroxychloroquine please Sometimes, much choice independence bad thing.

The U.S. still much like teenager car huge allowance. That's biggest issue, dont care unemployed getting it, need it. I'm upset ""essential"" employees getting shafted. making much money ones going work everyday nothing extra. base payment everyone unemployed due covid still working it. thing family gotten stress covid. come conclusion? going limited supply well next spring. like doses going show once. Every vaccine give athlete go play ball one someone else higher risk get. seriously can't believe want people die need college athletes play sport.

No delay, even hour, acceptable give lowest risk people priority anyone else.  ages 10 19** ability spread COVID-19 within household rate adults. age 10 also spread virus, rate significantly lower.   higher contacts children adults,"" study authors explained—meaning age group likely infect others adults are. ""Come sites. Stay coronavirus."" Since still heavily WIP treatment might bad scenario bunch fucking knuckle-draggers do. Sweden? Kind like difference “FDA-cleared” “FDA-approved”? Ok that's fair. think agree large investing countries get top priority yes countries like India, Brazil get (maybe many fast) number cases. Tried. Walmart, tom thumb, target, amazon, amazon fresh. 

None em stock, ever. Man insecure men lol We're talking closing hundreds intersections dozens towns, used regularly locals. It'd practical simply kill exemption, throw red tape people trying use it.

Americans travelling Cambodia currently need pay ""liability deposit"" amount $3,000 USD pass customs. Canada that? Without hyperbole, important humans living working planet right now. want see COVID19 go way dodo bird.

That virus might evolve beautiful intelligent beings one day. moving one racist fascist country another, lol. aside vancouver, really matters freezing canada, people find out, nobody want move. would help man top backing up. amount conflicting information coming various government agencies helping. need unified message strategy, sadly, think happen change leadership. put cell phone business know happen media goes ""yay, problem solved!""? People throw *all* precaution wind whatever tf feel like. 

I personally support downplaying subject reason, existence-doesn't-mean-available studies-are-ongoing etc. American way Ok, ~~go home now.~~

Get mugged now. hell would want sign unproven vaccine know side effects? I've always wondered people want guinea pigs stuff like this, get financial compensation? safe, isolating. Typically infectious first week contracting covid. want infect someone who's elderly pre-existing condition. Ages 10 - 19

""Researchers analyzed 59,073 contacts 5,706 coronavirus patients detecting  COVID-19 11.8% 10,592 household contacts 1.9% 48,481 non-household contacts. found patient 0 age 10, 5.3% contacts within household tested positive. However, patient 10-19, percentage jumped three times 18.6%. "" 850 miles find bed. That’s long ambulance ride. waiting right opportunity use one, you? guess people speak different speak to. Usually bring topics starts persecuted etc. interesting point climate change is, believe real (there actually study recently showing 100% human made, don’t remember name read information), people speak bring another hoax. think issue isn’t stupid thinking critically issues want re-evaluate world view. Sometimes harder admitting could wrong something actually taking new facts growing. lot people town also super religious believe whatever Catholic Church tells believe parrot talking points you. 
I also agree “rights” taken away temporarily masks fail see different “rights” taken away world wars due need focus solely war efforts. also feel like terminology “living fear” usually used condescending way put people down. Trump hurting chances actions, spelt pandemic happened. isn’t preset took fact even want think Christians United States persecuted Jewish people WWII asinine hateful itself. 
I think may defending people think viewed unfairly, however, isn’t true. basing points years living community, related to, friends rural people. stupid. live bubble refuse see anything outside bubble. Many people community shown exactly think extremely disappointed saddened outright hate ignorance unwillingness learn grow. cognitively impaired. 
Please note: always exceptions generalizations.  God damn feel good great again. Considering talking US history, US classes, thought given. beg differ point Americans Canadians same. Canadian married American spent fair amount time US. lot fine nice Americans LOT really ugly people there. first time heard in-laws use ""n"" word, stunned. That's say share assholes nothing compared US. much inclusive society where's attitude I've got mine fuck jack. Yea. may try figure way visit soon possible pandemic calms way down. Put Canadian money country &amp; people love.

Otherwise, I’m least immunocompromised person family, I’m one getting supplies two households. We’ve mostly self imposed isolation since mid-March *know* homes “clean” I’m vector. likely keep vaccine ready. I’m going really need vacation end this. Going anywhere lovely pipe dream right now.

I don’t understand US response either. Almost entire rest world got pandemic control. “the greatest country world!” Ah well. 

Stay safe! There’s idiots every where... proves point. I'm glad expert people visit area I've lived entire life. dual citizen ever Canada vacation, wife really considering it. easy us? Good luck reporting every small town county state. big cities counties already implemented mask mandates (that governor later nullified) ones actually enforcing statewide order. modern vaccine release public ever greater risk taking it.

Even deadliest vaccines saved killed tenfold.

So basically safety vaccine comes going biggest concern. "" vaccine - called ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 ""

&amp;#x200B;

it's literally chad vaccines could yes, people aren’t educated so. people know film industry (in make pretty decent salary sometimes mid-low 6 figures depending craft) live paycheck paycheck. conversations close colleagues camera Dept saving 6 months pay even uncertain times terms employment (as freelance work job job) 95% people idea “how save” they’ve never taught. It’s definitely education thing. Good news 20k upvotes sub? HAPPENING?!?! Sure, lot every day people control other's time, especially officials, still doomed people's stupidity.  


It's short-sighted assume, American citizen, find likewise victim similar short-sightedness. Yang.

Gang.

What predicted seemed far fetched, disaster far care. COVID, reality staring us face sure stand foot cliff staring abyss. /u/bontesla reading this?! looks terrifyingly real. Fuck.  right side wiper hit panic button yeeted ether painfully mediocre rain storm.

No Gordon, I’m idiot sandwich. Well completely unacceptable. Thank shining light horror. hope addressed not, continues headline news. God damn Immigration ""easy"" there's brain drain fill skills deficit.

For folks - keep eye out. trying funny? Murdering 140,000 people, fighting even bare crumbs aid, fucking virus response point criminal negligence, deploying secret police start abducting people tend that, yes. Ann Coulter must sooooo jealous right now. Italy watched China, said happen here. NE US watched Italy, happen here. South watched Northeast, said definitely happen (nanananana fuck u NYC). anything learned, stupid. Good. Keep beating submission. Maybe come back they'll keep habit (LOL). Government website, quick google search.

Announced Business Secretary Alok Sharma today (Monday 20 July), government agreed significant partnerships leading pharmaceutical vaccine companies BioNTech/Pfizer Valneva developing innovative new vaccines protect people coronavirus. government also secured access treatments containing COVID-19-neutralising antibodies AstraZeneca protect cannot receive vaccines cancer immunocompromised patients. wrong, miss England tbh ...why? need ensure 1 month. vaccine already human testing phase They're going start declaring test labs bio-hazard scenes closing due health violations? know, there's probably coronavirus inside lab somewhere. actual stats that?  US new Mexico? ""Sh*thole country sending bad people""? like New Zealand Australia? world divided...  mean. USA definitely bastion science innovation despite going politics.   working since SARS, like 6 years think. no. Holy dystopia, Batman. Auto parts stores free. Try endure 1 month. lot vaccine final testing phase. ""So said people, 'Please, slow testing.'"" Exactly point, besides POC marginalized peoples, Americans deserve live built suffer consequences. country let leave

If POC want emigrate that’s obviously different story NorCal Bay area faring much better. avoid California together right now. :(

&amp;#x200B;

Source: NorCal rising cases deaths boosters. studies far say 91% get immune response wanted see upon first dose, number goes 100% second dose. 

So, everyone gets 1 dose, people likely need booster (vulnerable people, people weak immune systems need little extra help) well HCPs, teachers, etc. REALLY want 100% immediate protection for, etc. get booster.  work Trump's PR team Que anti-vaxxers. :/ Same. It’s mind blowing see everyone acting like there’s pandemic months late. hope not, lol. Seems inevitable point sadly. Nah man call brown people terrorists Or...he could following orders given off-the-record another authority. takes hit gets kind benefit road form high-paying cushy position board directors (or higher post zero visibility).

Or...on conspiratorial note...his obedience ensure information possible past prison-worthy misdealings won’t leaked press. time life probably would done same.

Now would resign fact a) would require effort part b) change person's behavior. 

And there's possibility c) see reaction actively try engage, almost never turns well. Definitely near-zero chance person suddenly saying ""what hell here? let get mask on... ahh, much better... thank you, stranger!""

Some people want fight. prefer disappoint people. irrelevant ridiculous thing say. vote. understand it’s like everyone, people put much don’t get jobs even minimum wage ones. also $12 $4 minimum wage teen working 40 hours week that’s $160 extra $8 week. Even isn’t much extra live of. I've come suspect ""good news"" postings progress vaccines--a little bit like tv ads pharmaceuticals. Moderna posts quite often trying get name recognition, imagine (soon might be, ""when ask vaccine, ask Moderna--a name trust"")
😉 Yes did. AstraZeneca made deals number institutions provide enough vaccine everyone interested. also newer versions article.

The US ordered 300 million doses US/UK supply chain. 

The IVA (EU) purchase 400 million doses produced Catalent Italy.

India ordered 1 billion doses (probably) produced companies related Serum Institute India. 

There many, many supply chains many people possible access timely fashion.

All all, production capacity 2 billion doses might higher already. heard, Trump says ""Masks Trump take credit it. upvote. 666... hell happened LA? sister lives there, like month ago said things fine 🤔 Texas others creating regional national problems, though.

Colorado uses private labs like 2/3 1/2 testing, labs getting boggeddown states much own. Great! Thanks, keept up. there’s problem production. Take Canada, New Zealand, Australia. Plus there’s always animated films documentaries. forget snitches miasma poor hospital! I'd guess time die somebody chance life needs ventilator. guess he's Trump told too. Keisha Lance Bottoms said Trump broke law visited Atlanta day without wearing mask... pure retribution. Kemp needs recalled now, need wait years. deserves. Again, SEVEN day average DOWN. claim due weekend lag, every single SEVEN day average WEEKEND it. don’t know explain clearer. Well know come October we'll Europe. Can't wait antivaxers undermine contrived fashion.

As me, well glad see vaccine horizon. work shit protecting staff hopefully it'll play if/when second wave comes around.

Kudos medical professionals around world worked develop vaccine quickly midst global pandemic fuck world leaders hindered progress along way misinformation allowing virus spread unnecessarily What’s positivity rate threshold batch tests make meaningful difference?

1%? People point things like want make feel better. virus kill disable anyone, that’s scary think about, people latch anything makes feel like person “had coming”, lack better term. know multiple people medical field still brush hoax overreaction WORKING COVID PATIENTS. Including one advocating opening everything moonlighting New York. point, literally nothing anyone says surprises me. Thanks. That's now, forever more, #DeathSantis. question is...they ordered 100m doses. nail ""recipe"" speak, could distribute drug makers could make thing pump lot doses? built state constitution:

“Public employees shall right strike,” reads Article I, Section 6 document. country vaccine. return trade deal... know Monday, two week mark, accounts last weekend. 

I hoping mask order start make difference. week two, new closures make difference. don't, country deep trouble. Texas barely anything florida nothing. ""Begs"", lol. Dumb people (the hecklers) always scream loudest. We’re hearing voices ill-informed sense social norms (since they’re clinically insane). Agreed People actually getting checks states reside in. I’m in. exactly!  yeah, also 5 years trials behind it. tested entering bubble too. people ""happy"" insurance 1) they've never deal crisis wont cover treatments need 2) experience true socialized medicine &amp; 3) experience single payer country Medicare/Medicaid VA. study doesn’t say proven offer immunity immune response, every trial every candidate.

In SARS1 subjects died challenge trials. 100% fatality test subjects vaccine trials halted. There’s reason assume play better. test subjects rendered immune SARS, however upon exposure immune systems went cytokines storms killed all.

It’s way early celebrate, even article claims exaggerations quotes Boris Johnson saying So.

Personally fact U.K. ordered 100m doses USA ordered 300m doses unproven, untested vaccine concerning. vaccine released regardless safety efficacy much money behind now. “Too big fail” even show 1% reduction transfer good enough get market.  News stories subreddit mention 49 — 53 — hospitals Florida full ICUs. I’m sure find them. don’t watch cable news either. 

And *you’re* saying they’re sending people home, means *even more* people ill. Goodness. sounds even worse. 85.4% vaccine candidates go phase 3 approval according [this (keep mind phase 3 already started weeks ago vaccine).

We looking emergency use approval vaccine, FDA actually lowered efficacy rate bar 50% (according [this makes 85% figure even higher. addition this, seems like oxford vaccine first available option, decreases bar approval, 85% figure looking like 95%&lt;. Obviously never 100%, think optimism unwarranted.

It's question *if*, question point. enlightened State College work Florida mandated workers return campus.

I'm I've WFH isolated since March wife who's immuno compromised.

When raised concerns returning work, went way Director said ""You WFH rest week gotta go least 1 day week college President says otherwise everyone.""

In NYC hospitalization data shows virus already declining sometime mid March hospitalization admittance peaked last days March.

The US South showing flatlining late June. UK 100 million doses said vaccine lined distribution, Trump's proven he'll raid foreign supplies get vaccines country needs. country country, larger military allow us seize supplies force get back normal. great. see sister nurse go back work actively working garden instead born naked, yet, wear clothing societal legal obligations. wearing mask different? obligation keep someone's precious Satan's spawn catching site nipples, obligation wear mask keep others dying? live world take nudity seriously take possibility spreading deadly virus. Could perhaps druggable pathway fight infection?  Oh, well I’m argue cases tend follow weekly pattern ebbs flows, wholeheartedly agree regard.

Forgive confusion, say

“we leaping conclusions Arizona manipulating hospitalizations”

And someone responds

“Well, are”

I tend assume responding claim made instead something completely unrelated comment. I'm hoping maybe next summer things mostly back normal. want able fly back home country spend time family friends, worrying afar really hard there's still come. hope there's possible coronavirus vaccine proven effective end year, however, widely Health care workers prioritised people deemed high risk Covid-19 due age medical However, widespread vaccination likely be, earliest, next year even everything goes plan.  increase deaths per million per day 0.75 3.3 concerning? Sure, course is. time preventable deaths concerning.

But clear reason report ""the death rate 300% since June 1"" headline. One sounds hell lot sexier terrifying other. Again, beautiful thing working really small ratios: rates instill fear; comparison two even new rate still scary. mean that’s little stretched, I’m from
there, yea there’s income disparity. parents teachers, weren’t poor rich 
The school districts major employers help create middle class I'm shocked shocked hypocrisy alleged ""pro-life"" people. Trump's move taking data reporting CDC really trick! says ""starting look like winner"" ""start meeting friends pandemic over"" see feel need say that. That's.. Exactly point trials.   mean, mandatory state (Oregon), conservative boneheads making political issue causing problems it. article behind paywall. fact comforts well get windshield replaced asap Good her! sounds awesome. 30% lung capacity terrifying hospital overrun never materializes.

[Try go. u big talker. think so. I've seen one topless person city think older lady activist. topless protest years ago, too! lines CDC revised guidance told everyone start wearing masks. that's question I'm asking I'm sure aware.

Back *beginning* COVID-19 US, almost one recommending masks general population. family member got job like 3 applications couple weeks. everyone boat. vaccine made cats, humans... What's *your* point? really tried follow this....but...take away this? entire healthcare system needs torn rebuilt. going hurt brain... (July 4th weekend America) wish WOULD said it! probably would chortled death watching Democrat strongholds trying figure whether wear masks sue Trump illegal mandate. should. like watching someone shit floor gather flies....

Senator Mitch McConnell way. Frankly, I’m surprised Bahamas didn’t ban visitors United States sooner. 
Still beter late never!  feel like hyperbole.

Not diminish ounce work done relative speed vaccine due stroke great genius. largely part head start afforded work done previous virus carried well. 100 years feel like we'll see pandemic 1918 one viewed today. Textbooks read something effect `""A million people died significant economic impact vaccine found"". again, want downplay anything. suffering terrible multiple civil wars last 100 years higher death tolls relatively unknown worse economic shocks. bad, simply think it'll stand test time top tier historic event. Three four decades largely forgotten.

Issac Newton's work known another thousand years.

Again, trying shit vaccine anyone involved. simply think sense scale exaggerated we're still middle it. still OEM wipers dealer change inserts go maintenance cost less new wipers depending buying Everybody sub troll knows shit going get 10000% worse span next six months. need miserable cunthole tell everyone shitty rest lives make everyone feel worse already fucking do. swear fuck like everybody sub holding never-ending circlejerk trying say miserable prediction future.

I'm kind getting impression. 

I guy tell buying $600 phone every years make much difference. generate lots outrage first, last-minute extensions made final. That's Congress works here. Nepal Commonwealth nation.

But here's hoping developing nations dont get left out. Foreign aids important them. Arizona? like AriCorona right Oh god, appalling disgusting. poor nurses, mistreated neglected patients exactly!! say thanks, actually help; sign petitions PPE reduce shift times, etc,. how's wrong? According Worldometer total Asia deaths 81,000. get data from? guess trying show food workers skills might useful another field. think dining going even close. I've seen many posts 10 years. came suggestions, something seen anywhere Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  fuck would anyone want visit Missouri? states took shutdowns much seriously others.

Would need much depth analysis. state include part shutdown policy? enforced? citizens take things seriously start house parties instead going bars? on

We also look countries effectively contained virus learn them. 

Hell, face things, idea reducing social interactions reduce virus spread totally ridiculous.

Seems like agenda trying find something support said agenda good news, means nothing ICU beds available  much want bet vaccine US chooses one own. Yes never knew much missed normal life tbh. us go profession genuine care caring others difficult times

And boy people charge facility purse strings take advantage that. nursing health care, educators social workers too.  chaos strike?

im dead serious Damn, Americans pretend NHS like. They're con, ignore them. I've dealing nonsense point get blocked lol. brought Hillary COVID debate lmao. take advice beginning pandemic?

More like, millions DID.

And thousands died result.

146,000 exact.

The entire CONTINENT Asia 35,000 deaths total, comparison.

Again, trying say? Saying ""oops, wear seatbelt accident already happened"" ""good science"". bonus people die, that's it. two Americas.

There's America mostly works people.

And there's America nothing works there's recourse.

You belong former trying use experiences talk folks belong latter. Everyone read article.

100% efficacy two doses. like recipe ignorance soup. one things good, combine together put leadership wind something that's completely incapable adapting situation requires utilize data, science, empathy. set hospitals? say ""mum"" Europe? come from... lol data typically time-delayed. Takes time work medical examiners, get aggregated week/month. NY real-time data non-covid excess deaths. spike NY death counts Jun 30 ""late"" data march-may. systems stuff built tracking real-time, whereas emergency systems specific COVID are. 

And that's relatively functional state like NY. state government interest minimizing perceived severity pandemic, different story. They'll fight tooth nail make sure hard get COVID cause-of-death attribution. They'll require test simultaneously limiting supply tests access criteria, on.

Russia exact thing, btw. huge quantities excess ""pneumonia"" deaths low ""covid"" deaths. Probably still do. works. clear, *is* part study, phase 3 don’t results yet. ""Doctor's Hospital Renaissance"" ones? beautiful moment. Reading comment made eyes water. Wow FrEeDoM fAt i’ve seen evidence this, wondering recently anti-mask media actually coming russia. culture war seems much like repeat know last election. That’s right. 

Fauci world-class researcher Adams world-class doctor. doesn’t make automatically good policy makers.

Their initial COVID response messaging horrendous. Time new team. called challenge trials. something considered might still done questionable ethical standpoint intentionally give someone disease cure matter confident feel vaccine work. uh, yeah, think canceling $7/mo Netflix account, buying $600 phone every 3 years, gonna help much. thanks advice, luv :)

I can't disagree numbers.  point yes, help. Along things course, does.  use logic justify expense (it help much). complain make enough. love angering berds reddit part. Keep up, but, ""woe me"" woah. Yeah weird happy. Can't criticize that. It’s true, NHS politics buzzword (where’s £350 million, Boris?)

I like patriotism form actually treating like deserve throwing round applause whilst doctor/nurse passes due ridiculous shift length Humans deserve sent deaths horrifically.

Period. choice description. lot practical keep things way are. number infections traced Americans came Canada using method zero far know, we're talking single digit case numbers. lot outrage super minor problem. There's thousands times incidents Canadians breaking mask mandates concerning. I'm honestly tired hearing it. know healthcare system sucks, I'd love change it. reminded every 5 minutes wears mentally makes feel hopeless. Ah yes, US never given sort humanitarian aid. war. Got it. biggest fear work, problem least about. Rather nationalistic approach ask looks like meat's back table! Regular hospitals sitting pristine making billions people die makeshift facilities. Hospitals overwhelmed globally, horrifying sure much worse withhold medical treatment, effectively leaving people die shitty conditions. Yes regular hospitals treating covid patients. Yes overwhelmed, America already overwhelmed. patients die hidden away back rooms covered ants may less visible isnt less real.

Edit: typo Haha, reminds reddit post months back said Idiocracy actually better America. Idiocracy realize need help turn smartest man fix things. reality, we're ignoring scientists epidemiologists. Plague rats.




 Get together. mandatory South Africa almost 4 months now,same amount time we've lockdown really shouldn’t DMV processing tests? has. really has! 

Mine remarkably caring everyone ever knew face shit, others either denial, dont care, etc..... got really lucky found something March, moved early April beginning state’s lockdown. think got lucky. sure things nowadays relate. 

Also people think mental math, get piece paper since I'm person draw everything. I'm automatic calculator.

Also fact I've told 'of course doctor,' since people like naturally become doctors. No, 8 years higher ed residency work hard through, all. 'poof' mom stethoscope

Let's also bring whole 'dating gay Asian American man' this. That's friggin' hoot. fake media?

/S Interesting. Americans want illegal immigrants, they're racist, Canada want immigrants, ""good reasons.""

Do honestly think immigrants come America make country better? I've worked Canadians years come US. reason came here? wanted make money. sweet tomato spaghetti hot dogs like Filipino national favorite. Could jus told public wear sort face coverings like April instead telling masks don’t work “healthy” people. see dealing someone chooses read. know seat belts don’t work 100% time. everyone knows help. It’s exact thing masks. won’t stop disease it’s tool help spread though. something isn’t 100% doesn’t mean doesn’t work. Nice conspiracy theory 👍 clean hospital thing makes complete sense. 

You want cancer patients getting infected corona patients, people avoiding hospitals quite serious conditions fear getting coronavirus.

Patients need safe place treat illnesses times. way guess “guesstimate” many professions.

63mill people x 1.44 (44% optimism bias new project likely need 44% whatever need)

X 10% contingency top lols (risk pot case)

63 x 1.44 x 1.1 = 99.8M.

( common principle applied many uk government projects work on, someone asked pick figure 5 mins based logic that’s I’d go for!) looks like came onion... cringey hurts.

Vaccine boat race winners 2021, well they'll get one least still believe can’t move Canada. That’s works. Millions starry eyed Americans disappointed lol.  Nah, ignorant people blessed Many cities counties anything it. Reasons include: mistaken belief mandating masks and/or limiting businesses unconstitutional (bad legal advice attorneys), believe state decision, believe people wear masks mandated, believe educate encourage people wear masks, believe little risk COVID, afraid get elected again. Governors authority

Governors _may_ authority. laws written state.

For instance Colorado Montana Governors apparently authority, Governor Wyoming apparently not. *shrek voice* Yeah, like ever happen. Ehh, basically still know nothing. still mean we'll ever get vaccine.  Woo-hoo! America! We’re #1!! We’re #1! Yes, started early July believe Phase 4. Phase 4 fully reversing, Restaurants still indoors - bars without food licenses operate outdoors now. gyms reduced back 10 max. actually prevent people getting COVID 19?   restaurants gonna shut soon one employee tests positive Covid.

Sheesh.  Yes, dumb enough go them? Oh great border closed. gonna move? trump could stop waffling mask wearing, strongly recommend governors enact mask orders, recommend Americans wear masks, yet can't even man way worse. USA runs absolute idiots Well several states US making masks mandatory, one one. wish they'd faster. said health department emailed form sign said would check daily, self isolate let officials know treated hospital.


They took Covid-19 test see could safely visit grandparents.

But learning Covid-19 refused sign form stating would self quarantine, check daily, let know needed go hospital.


Seems weird would complain house arrest going self isolate anyway. sounds like concerned grandparents, care community.

So ankle bracelet stuck home like say planning anyway. release recipe free rest world. can't that's answer want hear. That's said phase never really ends. reality would something like ""well see little bit damage possible could lot damage time"" ""this damage body would able repair long term"". 

But reason assume long term damage short term indicators weighing low risk much higher risk disease presents. reason assume unsafe long term see anything. typo - actually Corvid-19 vaccine, prevents people turning crows 146,000 deaths.

“And also, soon became clear enough protective equipment cloth masks homemade masks good masks would buy surgical supply stores. context strongly recommending it, correct thing. knowledge changed realization state outbreak changed,” told outlet. 

Public health experts Fauci Adams advised public wearing masks late February March outbreak began worsening U.S. health workers experienced PPE shortages.""

He really wrong said, shortages masks given people really need them, front line workers. also much knowledge time virus. Also cases 144-500, Worldmeter says 500, Google one says 144.

Edit: Miss quote ""Fauci said White House coronavirus task force informed meetings serious problem lack personal protective equipment (PPE) masks health providers front lines treating coronavirus patients. said led public health officials, including U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams, say “right really need save masks people need most.” Let's honest, lot probably are. communities patronize store also it. feel bad work ignorant, things happen vacuum. 10-to-1 odds corporate spamming employees propaganda keep speaking up.

My heart breaks patients health care workers. 

Thank tagging me.

I can't believe this. can't believe happening. would test long term effect medicine like this? 
Genuinely curious... OK last summer, hot. know you, anytime summer really heats up, like cool iced-t immunity COVID-19. (then boyfriend, husband) great idea tricking body producing anti-bodies introducing small doses virus, also adding mint usual Ice-t recipe. Viola! vaccine sweet mint tea born. recipe go-to summer pandemics.... like they're collecting samples sending central national test site. Everything done state local level.

So state outbreak mostly control, pool testing absolutely makes sense. 

Florida lost cause though. guy called bullshit virus, start pandemic ? Highly unlikely monthly payments, want even extend weekly unemployment Well live, we've record breaking 95 degree days past two weeks various heat advisory warnings boot. country you, ask country

We killed guy :/ plasticized turd beat Andrew Gillum? Wow. lead horse water... retarded ones drown. Don’t know? Pandemic’s over! 

At least that’s husband jokes sees many people crowding around restaurants wearing masks acting like normal. 

Ever since reopened country, people started act like pandemic behind us. turned virus didn’t care human wishes deadlines. Fauci asked reopening, said “we don’t set timeline, virus sets timeline”. Republicans balked. 

So, squander months quarantine, squandered opportunity make ready spike infection. American kids children developed world attend school high rising infection rate. may fuck ups we’re still rich. I’m scientist peer review fanboy stops thinking moment peers dictate something. question methodology outcome. Methodology study think good. Outcome good. Neutralizing antibodies 100% 91% first dose. That’s good. It’s overall positive. 

It shows serious adverse effects healthy group people. It’s perfect needs get entire world take it. That’s beyond science. That’s thinking investor. psychology herd. need highly tolerable effective vaccine immunocompromised individuals. one isn’t it.  taking piss?

There SARS-COV2 vaccines failed phase 3? sources information? totally think this. think we'll pop um back bad flu seasons like countries already considerate. mean everyone, considerate people will.  even close. Thanks! wording, looks like they're funding research, one far enough along ""secure treatments"". Looks like we're moving right direction towards vaccine. gimme Literally Well going school different. like live school. still leave home, could coffee maker, go school. Thing kids wont put effort anything wouldnt make coffee unless to. americans prove daily emotional integrity &amp; intelligence 2 year old pretty clear idiot know he's talking about, I'm sure he's bothering? 

Didn't *""step back""* incredibly terrible job? trying make joke involving reddit rating system word ""underrated"", guess fell flat... :( Correction: screw source. Lol welcome riot not.

But condemnation stop entitled riot.

You live country rioters. live different America that's cannot understand rioting.

But people people support it. Tons reinfections could asymptomatic, initial infections be. first infection could asymptomatic reinfection symptoms. immunity could 4ish months that's we're starting see (presumed) reinfection cases pop up.

And think absurd say wont know years reinfection possible. seem implying people testing positive 4 months apart part infection, alarming own.  Well actually no. numerous studies show covid even asymptomatic cases affects many organs. According study almost men effects talked about. no. Pretty much everyone affected long term damage migh show strongly yet. look children get kawasaki symptoms sick covid quite time later. idea devastating end up. looking people intensive care really dangerous underestimate much damage done. China stopped using pcr test far reliable chest xray look lung damage seems happening everyone gets this. notice lung pain receptors low oxygen levels go unnoticed while. I'm extremely skeptical. possible noticing this, true? Based experience (New Jersey 2017 &amp; New Mexico 2019), daily injection heparin prescribed almost everyone spending days hospital bed *in US*. cases pass 100k today positivity rate went along daily case count there’s little good news mixed bad It’s early tell immunity last. early studies seen far focus antibodies infer chances reinfection looking antibody levels. Antibodies part picture. example, smallpox vaccine antibody response decreases [75% six months, vaccine still confers immunity small pox decades. cautiously optimistic Covid vaccine confer long term immunity, take booster shots. 

$3000 shot absolutely absurd. indication cost covid vaccine significantly something like flu vaccine, affordable cases even without insurance. Cool, get hear running country pandemic inconvenienced him. Still tested here, tried get one. Know denied? symptomatic... seriously. 

The numbers comforting lie compared reality. Hes still confused can't start another scandal make pandemic go away like times previous  Good. Even ironically financial genius realizing could merchandised masks made lot money.

If realized that, would pushing masks pocketbook country would better off. True facts. ER doc Miami tells dying patients believe tells Covid19. black friday decline years, ever since started opening thanksgiving. started opening early would CLOSE like 1 am, they'd opening around time. stopped black friday. used fun shopping adventure mall, became pointless. sales even great, shop online. thought severe travel restrictions NH/ME area? Personally I'd say no. country kind outbreak we're experiencing US. risk exists Netherlands small, low risk. I'd like assume need arises need wear masks look us example do. 

We're still first wave. data I've seen shown plateaued short time, stay home possible first month people took seriously helped that. we've spiked fast still rising sign slowing down. 

Two different sides spectrum. I'm glad hear well though. Wish could say same. even reason let thing run rampant next two months. And, I've heard lot experts convinced vaccine ready early claimed. Maybe trials finish September, might receiving vaccine months that.

We everything slow thing down, wait vaccine also case vaccine takes longer expected. state medical users buying heavily taxed recreational marijuana illinois. crazy.  U.S. dibs too; send $1.2 billion Oxford's way. least we're still good throwing money problem. understand. But, none us symptoms. got tested 8th day father tested positive false negative rate lowest. careful around house much contact case false negatives taking place. 

Thank information though, really helpful. 1 testing safety. safe

It definitive. Basically, phase gave vaccine 500 people, healthy 55 years old. 

There's still lot learn safety overall population. It’s amazing multiple vaccines due released 2021. public needs understand vaccine existing FDA approved vaccine manufactured distributed difference 1 year. Experts speculating approved vaccine 1 billion doses available spring high risk essential workers. Joe Schmo expect around Dec 2021.

“Levels T-cells peaked 14 days vaccination antibody levels peaked 28 days. study run long enough understand long may last, study Lancet showed.”

Do T-cells stick around long period time? peaked 14 days according study. bit naive Americans think masks panacea absence robust contact tracing public health institutions. Masks help margins, Italians Spaniards barely wearing -- wearing properly -- despite ""mandated"" almost indoor places. devoted data fanatic choice occupation. Hate break news you, data comes ""dirty"" gets cleaned time. nature beast. 

I would guess deal data collection interpretation would understand aspect much better.

Add insanity pandemic error rate solidly.... add many overworked underfunded frontline, local state data collectors it'll messy. Take look much Covid data comes out, corrected review, later time. Oodles it.

Man. want get hopes up! part ranting refutes fact youths haven’t seen severe symptoms covid far? Thanks solving mystery inspector! god's work!

Around world. 23 vaccines trials 6 due released January iirc. Policy daily per capita death rate single day relevant regions completely different phases pandemic?

So country highest per capita death rate today? bet cannot even answer question one calculated today (or even yesterday). That’s irrelevant number is. 

It number used propaganda purposes. That’s like it.  Florida declaring deaths pneumonia well. called fudging numbers. deaths COVID related. Death numbers lower peak yet people infected initial peak NY, NJ California. add up. Flat stupidity Oh shit, sounds like full-blown Wuhan scenario.

All could prevented. True, like good echo chamber, gives confirmation confidence need continue offering maskless free masks public. markets near time highs? scientific literacy thing? know going ruling elite first poor last. Exactly inverse groups affected. Mathematician here. ""US breaks 7 day average every day last 26 day"" sounds like super-complicated way say ""increasing"", one gives real information beyond that.

The virus catastrophe. headline - ""U.S. breaks single-day record new COVID-19 cases 9 times month"" - stupid. 

It's another synonym ""increasing"". compatible ""steady, tiny growth"" ""huge exponential growth"". seeing records ticking up, jumping up?

Why give real growth rates? ""Active cases growing 3% per day"" (which last week) gives much better picture others far terrifying. 3% per day means cases double every month - multiply 40,000 times year. course, second case would plateau effect everyone caught long 40,000 reached - many people.  [Florida vs almost twice population. point shutting down. people Florida free support Presican’t Chump free die him. compare deaths year next average years, break categories see effects still go it, would schools start?  mean states push open schools now, lawsuit. producing supply parallel trials going Hopefully!

It’s terrifying. laws optional (apparently) cautiously optimistic Covid vaccine confer long term immunity, take booster shots. 

If optimistic, probably know something know.

So, think cause not-yet-existing vaccine permanent effect, vaccine permanent immune response common cold coronavirus? picture amount positives, causing massive singled retesting alot non compliance stupid population good ole USofA I'm already 😁 adults teach, staff, operate them, well families kids go home to.

Make sense?  too.  Sweden never ‘herd immunity strategy’. 

Yeah, keep repeating lie. Maybe we'll believe one day. link looks like n=4 day 43. published notes look pretty good me, basically four participants still monitored day 43 showed equivalent antibody immunity response someone recovered COVID. little extrapolate phase 1 efficacy, cohort size usually small n=4 small.

Also, lot kids good cold weather clothes. Hence coat drives every year. absolutely considered possible. know joking, scenario luckily situation we're in.

A) Oxford's manufacturing partner already pledged 300M doses US also identified US manufacturing partner 

B) second third promising candidates, achieved nearly identical results Oxford vaccine, either completely American (Moderna) US-German co-production (Pfizer/BioNTech). Waaaaaaaah us Americans stupid dumb! don’t even healthcare gun control! Waaaaa! Us Americans racist screwed!!! AZ [estimated 100k tests mean data control properly hidden now? means probably oct-nov EU, US vaccines hit market right? Yep. value little accuracy. try time. 

I'm done here? Haha okay Judge Judy. rest world watching Florida reopen things worst possible time. Maybe protests... don’t know. don’t fight fascism... get used it. happened rule 4? control now? got hit harder earlier, responded got control. countries listed got hit later (ie time respond) controlled outbreaks. Yes, it’s cdc website true herd immunity experiment know, actually see resemblance mention it. MN here, too. fortunate similar situation. work mainly contracts accounting/finance, agency found opportunities whole time. work since April going little crazy despite covered unemployment. Finances okay (we'll see happens end end week), whole self-confidence/self-worth thing seen better days.

There's really next nothing perm. job opportunity realm either. Yeah - us know agree you. rules sub go lot detail, I'll say idiots minority, also unfortunately loud wielding power should. 

I assure you, though, wider circle horrified going actions loud stupid minority.

It's hope due time, logical heads prevail we'll allowed join rest world again. Say, somewhere around third week January... second table compares last year least. remember deaths reported lag many Testing positive ≠ sick. Woah, good try stealing credit - clearly Oxfordshire achievement!!!!
 
For real though... Scotland, Wales, NI small regions small economies punching well weight centuries opression. issue letting moments sharing them. That's first thing thought owner Apple Bistro says disagrees county health rules he's going implement them.

I can't imagine eating place owner like, ""Health rules just, like, opinion, man.""   got facebook post ad trial AZ. comments ad doozy. never get old ones off! seem like every car different that?? live rural Montana governor mandated masks last week... Exactly. seen anti masks attack people reason.

They also reduced taxes 6 months.

Gee, wonder many worship orange idiot called *less testing*... I’m getting corona virus vaccine Living moderately cold country deal common colds several times year say... no, wont happen, common cold thrives temperatures zero, usually get next person walking around office (sort like covid related)...

Forget that. good news is, vaccination tests look promising. bug, feature. I'm going say less population per square mile England example. see trends America: less densely populated liberal states fine rn because: 1) governments act science 2) less population. 

England always going get affected coronavirus Scotland - can't solely ascribe different governments. C.A.T. it. I'd argue namely Florida, Arizona Texas running full force economic catastrophe. Can't wait January 21st Republicans ask economy fixed yet. Smh  I'm sure regional solution could been? Isolate Finnish Tornedalen rest Finland, allow go Sweden?

And hatred, suspicion nationalism grows? explain difference MRNA normal vaccine? keep seeing people say idea means. layman’s terms please!

Edit spelling. thing advocate making money, someone else getting less. Lots people jobs go back motivation really matter. heard wear mask, stock market looks bigger. People choosing go one nation's biggest hotspots covid? Stupidity numbers dangerous. complete 180 March April. anyone really trust guide us future? everyone Florida condones behavior, kind lame thing say  I'm thinking correlation level self-perceived privilege vs actual intelligence.

But muh US bad something something conservatives Trump. poverty homelessness good human life? Agreed 100%. I’d love CO right now, COVID not.

Quit job, get evicted, live car repossessed, live street get covid anyway, without health insurance even survive, even debt before.

Or keep job, pay bills, keep house food table, catch covid, least health insurance. Hope majority survive. Interestingly, terms actual spending, Republican administrations every level almost always create bigger government relative Democratic administrations.

The question is: money going?

A ""fiscally conservative"" Republican using code say want country helping poor people whose skin darker own. completely fine going huge amounts debt fuel cronysim military contracts, corporate subsidies like.

It's coincidence Republicans started pushing measures help spread COVID-19 almost immediately studies came showing virus impacting communities color urban communities - strongly Democratic-voting demographics - disproportionately. Yes, can't look % GDP collected measure. get half picture. 

Malta takes 15% flat rate revenue outside Malta - much better US amazing little island live :) 

But yes, France pay bucketload taxes, mentioned earn 65k walk away around 42 end year. believe fever common side-effect vaccinated. Fever sign body working. time universal basic income.

Highly intelligent comment, thanks.  concern throwing money wind. want get economy track? fight virus executive orders across entire country. going allow states please, looking Florida, Arizona Texas, pointless. need page. Instead we're wasting lives resources reelection campaign strategies trying score political points. world live stating accurate facts cast ""downplaying news."" vaccine ready September.

People stuck ""by September"" botched headline thry lazy click through.

The people smarter saying ready September. Full Stop. ""potato tomato."" accurate reporting something. call ""picked apart"" getting dimed calling something pessimism actually line actual timeline.

We already dealing shit ton problems science discovers new stuff changes mind. perpetuate digging feet incorrect date. sure social collapse talking isolation caused stay home. clear, whether actual order irrelevant: absence order many people would still isolate due virus. 

Many people could deal economic issues still friends, vice versa. Take away well... point airlines realize losing battle. People getting sick flying packing masks going stop spread. Flori**duh** Thats honestly funny hell. Here’s example real leadership Democrat Mayor Democrat-dominated city addressing protestors Pandemic:

“You heard need held accountable, responsibility police police city LITERALLY JOB. votes city council get comprehensive accountability passed TODAY- let’s start immediately enacting policies make safer soliciting community feedback city website changes go back review every complaint filed last 30 years clean police force good. heard, go home. Action coming immediately make safer show rest country actually enact swift meaningful change ALREADY POWER, risking many Black Lives pandemic. People saying white supremacist agitators actually ones looting burning homes businesses, that’s true let’s give cover destroy lives livelihoods Black men women city let’s let police actually jobs hired keep safe”.

The sad thing hearing battle cry register vote like magically undo generations nonsense- maybe time, people power next January people put us crappy situation first place, don’t mean Senate/Congress/President/Supreme Court allowing greedy people progressively destroy economic equality generations. took jackass top constantly pushing everyone’s buttons wake people up. big cities many already voted elected plurality people supposed align interests. representatives don’t know don’t care enough corrupted self-interests, cities representation fix crap last 50 years nothing.

Just open eyes, yes – Donald Trump scumbag. scumbags, sides aisle dating back centuries. Voting alone isn’t going anything, need present representatives clear plans action commit hold accountable enacting vision people represent. sucks. Probably worth point provision CARES act: “Health care facilities receive $100 billion CARES Act Provider Relief Fund allowed balance-bill patients COVID-19 treatment.”

Though perhaps facility went didn’t get money fund. stupid.

Flu shot also mandated covered insurance per ACA (though insurance place limitations receive it). Suprised James Harden hasnt discovered cure able go back happen find study, please reply that. Thank you. Stick daddy Interesting. also says account difference demographic distribution places hardest hit, like New York, still interesting nonetheless. Thank you.

COVID-19 supposed subside summer since virus doesn’t fare well sun heat. However, didn’t really see much wanted due lack social distancing. 

So we’re bracing already rampant virus spread exponentially cold season kids go back school citizens start celebrating holidays. conditions prime COVID-19 survive/spread. 

COVID-19 gonna fucking blood bath America fall/winter hits. get vote 1) comparing perhaps worst country done most-inept leadership top;

2) Swedish strategy, disastrous there, would likely even worse places citizenry less compliant suggestions government, worse health (like obesity) things like multi-generational households. 

3) proper comparison other, similar countries, done INCREDIBLY well compared Sweden. Teachers could lose teaching certificates, pay frozen, employees large risk retirements. Surely country's school could hold classes outside, least December winter. makes sense precautionary testing.

Not people exposed symptoms. He's already said ""I'll right eventually."" like yeah, eventually Covid 19 around. Like, yeah dude. black plauge went away too...eventually  love Albuquerque normal circumstances (mostly hometown I'm bored it), I've super happy pandemic.

Entirely nonessential It’s pump numbers up. 

You gotta tests get numbers, argument gets stronger ____________ agenda. decomposing. first modern times discrepancy pics one person...the rest empty beds equipment texts...

I firm believer since watching China seeing horrific videos pictures morgues hospitals overrun bodies, doctors screaming crying/pleading help, pics doctors nurses face mask sores, drone videos empty Wuhan, videos people boarded homes video man walking alongside automated vehicle pass supplies homes far America seen nothing coronavirus statistic numbers recently started question why...

I given link thread see picture video evidence see texts sad things texts saying they're threatened pics empty beds equipment single pic man ants feel really shows anything concrete department covid proof...this starting bother me...not single nurse patient visitor video social media hospitsl overrun people ventilators, video chaos stress lack room...

Does anyone else find odd somewhere online kind proof come across? going get it? Also wearing mask ineffective way kill saying.

It like driving around neighbourhood adhering traffic rules hoping jump front car terms effectiveness. covid too, time, visitors matter admitted feel completely. worried high schoolers though young people haven’t taking virus seriously have. I’m young adult, cautious. I’m worried returning school students haven’t cautious. Especially since, location, students aren’t required law wear face coverings - teachers staff are. tell kill terrorists something give patriotic name. Exactly thought. entire re-election team miss opportunity? Nah. like enough I'd like see right-wingers power long time. mean, *personally*, doubt much *you* power do. 
I'll keep voting, thanks. funny, sobering. Like many governors responses: ""well, uhhh, duh, need get back work, derp, ughh, cuz money, I'm fucking idiot.""   incredibly strong loving. I'm sorry others must experience unfathomably painful situations. showing care love ultimate super power. are. Low wage workers wages spend. Obviously still need unemployment stimulus money another way inject money economy. !remind me! 7 days need way. work hospital couple hours road this. We're bursting seams too, PPE need, FEMA nurses, opened multiple units accommodate patients we're little else caring Covid right now. support leaders speak right thing. Yeah we're tired too, Covid cause what's going DHR, greed. Unfortunately hospital story profit shows. really annoys republicans supposedly trying protect economy: they’d locked properly early enforced mask usage experts said so, could got virus control wouldn’t deal economic woes virus woes. common sense, they’d realised virus direct impact economy simply ignoring isn’t going make economy better off.  thought child abuse domestic violence increased.

Is overall reporting down? even think Parade. :( wondered ball dropping NYE. suddenly decided wear mask promote it, controlling data comes in. bet yuuge drop cases near future, annoying orange taking credit showing people way saving lives, many lives, likes one ever seen before. listened favorite president long time ago, told would soon disappear! /s disagree. think morality similar intelligence. think ""moral intelligence"" much thing and, similar body knowledge grows, body ""moral knowledge"" also grows. way, think judging someone like Aristotle Plato ""unintelligent"" simply smaller prior body knowledge pull misguided calling someone thought slavery ok ""immoral"" simply smaller prior body knowledge pull from. people, also dealing extremely uneducated people even pre-enlightenment people. simply absurd think would relevant knowledge come moral conclusions. Im school slp. Equally terrified. Kids won’t required wear masks district. district granted us late start announced us today still report person. Fuck. yeah, healthcare workers get another least 3 4 months rest us get it. think domestic packages riddled covid, though, right? ...Bubba blurted stumbling men's room, hoovered crushed oxycontin line meth...

Yes. agree. 

But incenses somewhat linked nationality.

I'm Indian PhD time rejected European institutions. Swedish institution quite honest me. interview panel informed difficult hire Indian visa Regulations.

American students went university settled Europe despite us graduated school nearly GPA, similar research background. 

I live USA now.

Edit - I'd like add problems USA itself. I'm happy honored country given chance good career. Yes, prefer Europe ungrateful towards USA. Trump bs getting though. messed up. already caught hospitalized 31. kids mom anti masker. I’m healthcare worker. 6 months immunity give take according doctor. could get vaccine flu season I’d cry. never want sick again. I'm positive covid sense taste smell went away. anyone know long supposed last? Devo. D-E-V-O Shut entertainment 

Entirely nonessential Look women’s Twitter account. even Texas - she’s Florida. she’s advertising fact she’s activist. read contents post caution. potential long term sequelae virus completely unknown. irresponsible assume everything fine children adults survive. 
Look HIV - initial illness mild flulike, resolves. several years later immune effects evident opportunistic infections present. 
Look chickenpox - initial infection resolved virus lays dormant return painful shingles years later. Honestly, I’ve going back forth whether right open schools (even though opinion doesn’t matter since I’m teacher parent lol). one hand, need maintain virus wrong expect teachers put families risk. mention students families well since many students live grandparents immunocompromised parents. time, don’t know expect parents need go back work keep kids home also make sure they’re online class. It’s really hard decision make like said, virus gonna spread like wildfire among younger children. comments article give hope. sure exactly makes Pri1, suspect either symptom severity high risk factors. pre-existing lung issue probably was. far taking long, told (this CareNow urgent care center) they're splitting tests Quest LabCorp processing basically national bottleneck.

So spike case rates created backlog Quest/LabCorp processing specimens, enough capacity moment. read earlier today FDA given Quest emergency approval begin ""batch testing"" combine multiple samples one test test whether anyone test group positive not, exact mechanism they'd use unclear me. Nah it’s coverup. cases reported. isolating site hospital remain open money making elective surgeries People like need fuck die. planet would better place without them. Anyone makes pandemic politics really doesn’t deserve live. UK ain't. AstraZeneka strong here. find another job, definitely plan same. Absolute insanity. freeze kill people can't pay rent anymore - therefore killing hosts virus, stopping spread. I'm sure complain manager get discount bill voucher free colonoscopy next visit. usually patients vented, oxygen coming straight wall, hospital's system

in facility, makeshift, supplies set up, they're using portable oxygen tanks, portable oxygen tanks contain like limited amount oxygen, need swapped every 45 minutes using high flow settings ventilator requires agree, know governor is?

Edit: words last time takes months new vaccine, even works could speed many vaccines, all. Response single epitope often enough generate protective immunity. could big jump, sort leap suggest consistent complexities human immunity. 

Immunology ridiculously complex. people find rocket science pedestrian. US every phone already tracks everything. trump said interview Chris Wallace last Sunday.  [I’ll right eventually right spaghetti policy. Trump came full favor mandatory masks would shit place fascist order people wear masks would even morons refusing wear already *simply said should*. mean 2020 elections gonna hacked too? worse Italy worse Wuhan.

Much people Wuhan. Wuhan-city population 11 millions. Lombardy ten million. Florida alone 21, Texas 28, California 39, Arizona 7 millions, Georgia another ten. Five states already talk 95 million people. think crucial reason referring babysitting.

No, younger kids can't learn independently. young kid can't teach read. slightly older kid \*can\* read book learn day's English lesson.  delusional guy? favorite President? exact words friends working Northern Italy ICUs earlier year. Fuck Trump minus-habens wingnuts turned emergency political grand standings. Fuck spoon One poorest places America, poorest. Yeah, people like refuse adapt shiw respect learning local language reason really like you.

It considered arrogant expect others switch language mother language staying many years. Vaccines used train immune system? 
Water wet? Theaters doomed business anyway. Revenues supported significant ticket price increases, actual number tickets sold declining since early 1990s. Even pandemic, watching movie theater compelling enough offering people. Hey worked full time since got put high school except 18 months went get degree accelerated program.i asthma im 30s, rona kind scary. government maybe let stay home die like 6 months? Ive work since april. work Medicare insurance companies; thing here. DHR terrible hospital Obama called 2009 speech rising healthcare costs. It’s one worst hospitals area, doesn’t surprise all. guess progress. Sorry! Next time I'll go 'nations' - find confusing calling country though. agree mask worn mouth nose, seems people complaining people covering nose go much. much virus really expelled nose vs. mouth? would think covering mouth gets 90% way there. 

Once again, agree cover nose, wearing incorrectly seems LOT better wearing mask all. there's something want inject body, liquid China made quickly possible...

I look forward robustly studied vaccine, first thing world could throw it. Afaik none politicians said states working rigorously implementing highest level restrictions necessary deal outbreaks. none work, they'll declare election invalid. world holds breath see happens 12:01 January 20. quote Dyatlov: 4000 unnecessary deaths? great, terrible. Honestly, feels like that.  [We people like UK, See ones mentioned things I've opportunity learn 'general knowledge' Brit grew-up France. Thanks those, I'll look them.

Then again, even teach History classes highschool US? ridiculous rant. since elite agreed become guinea pigs? talking gene sequencing dead remains? AFAIK (currently) possible.

If instead referring junk DNA within current human genome maybe belongs extinct viruses. However way identify junk DNA belonging viruses similarity existing viruses. pieces belonging extinct viruses currently living close relative way identifying such. Even resemble living viruses would probably difficult tell whether original virus extinct mutated current form. studies?

Both. 'believe' anything, read scientific studies. much butthurt lmao everything, including pandemic. Time again, reporters ask legitimate questions concerning pandemic, responds great smart rich stupid everyone else is. mean, geeze, come - people scared, good reason be, deserve solid information least honest answers. Anyhow, time someone like wants throw numbers me, care anymore cause trust gone window. never trust anyone feels raise putting people down, even worse they're supposed position leadership. seems way overblown me. Yes hotspots. brand new virus well-understood treatment deaths Europe 30% higher 2018 flu season (assuming giant second wave winter time). watched tonight’s Last Week Tonight? were. July 31. visa valid 25th something. got days extention. Yay.  There’s law place keep risk people safe, law wear masks indoor public areas. guy knew full well going effect, chose wear one. police called, nice politely asked leave. little show. asked again. bullshit him. warned him. change attitude. yes finally use force, I’m sorry cops everything right, we’re far police state, people decency think others privilege wouldn’t happened. Wear fuckin mask. Step 1 case investigations. That's get list contacts, places they've gone, work information worked contagious. Also case history - things like symptoms demographic info. 

Step 2 contact tracing, that's different team. job call contacts found investigation, tell interacted positive case, get tested make sure stay isolated 14 days following contact PUI (person investigation). idea keep infecting anyone (because know exposed presumably stay isolated asymptotically spreading disease). team suppose follow daily given case upward 8-12 contacts every day last checked respond daily texts messages sent bot (after initial contact tracing team). 

We also team case monitoring updating status (hospital, death, recovery) follows cases periodically fourth team rapid response worked contagious, shut workplace cleaning employee testing. We've also got call center makes initial contact let know they're positive team nurses house calls can't get hold case phone.

And needs scale time exponential growth. Case investigations arnt even suppose job - I'm community epi suppose work social determinants health (things like poverty, obesity, substance misuse ...shit like that) team normally case investigations still investigate normal stuff like Rabies, Zika, e. Coli, ect.. still happens.

Probably info wanted... good ole American way here, act big tough smart. reality, we're better anyone else. I’m sure you’re downvoted asking question, parts Lombardy might herd immunity: don’t think whole region however. Again, mask protect you, protect people around you.

And simply cannot afford everyone afraid stay home. Society cannot function way neither economy. Wait- thought wait make sure isn’t side effects. Like wait 6 months something. feel like read somewhere matter fast one “developed”, takes least year clinical trials, produce it, distribute it. understanding misconception? “not working” talking virus host? Imagine that. view safety people important profits. Still remember Trump wanted buy vaccine Germany make exclusive US? Yeah, Texas Revolution Mexican war pretty bad, Spanish American war blatant imperialism. 50 years, things looking big way. well trump wins that’s enough said, loses, he’s going accept results  Well tickets booked singularity, hope finish up... Damn, that’s harsh. One would think requirements would put hold time.... must high school students get social development classes? got social development outside classes exactly situation demands license suspension. restaurant disobeyed public health laws! problem gloves get contaminated people think don't, spreading germs feeling safe even touching themselves.

You get infected hands, matter virus skin glove actually. done math assertion? assume normal distribution time immunity wanes point enabling re-infection, even assuming infection probability current US (higher rest word order magnitude more) choose median order 6 months (which would even shorter-lived immunity common cold influenza) &amp; standard deviation month, statistically expect handful reinfections point. beginning pandemic, many saying might Chernobyl event China, end China's decades' growth, start CCP's downfall.

Well, months later, looks like Chernobyl event US, CCP restored legitimacy public confidence help Trump. “virtual” lockdown different literal one? might know gene sequencing? Florida learn though. I'd add ""until late"", we're beyond now. Really starting dislike many fellow Americans... fact lot poor countries fared far better western rich enlightened ones. fear getting infected westerners traveling around without care. watched zoeys infinite playlist I’m-at-home-forever thing, some, know, lighter fair, boy, angry everyone singing dancing large groups small spaces.... 😱 tidal wave , greatest ever! Tremendous I'm UK need travel partners visa requirements (only many straight days allowed country)and motherfuck trying figure out. 

Trumps incompetence still fucking ass thousands miles away. get saying measles's high R0 makes spread faster, thus infecting people, w.r.t. R0, basic, back-of-the-envelope formula get herd immunity need 1-1/R0 population immune. CoViD-19, would 50-70%. (Setting aside part where, anti-mask/anti-vax psychopaths effective lifetime vaccine-derived immunity, even _with_ vaccine, may unable reach even levels...)

For measles, means 93% population needs immune order achieve herd immunity, _much_ taller order, especially since people keep born - early vaccination _absolutely essential_ controlling it.  I'm sure think work health insurance major hospital California repeal ACA deny people getting treatment pneumonia previous illness symptom made cough. 

This reddit infuriating. say something factual get downvoted I'm cheering it. making simple correction want people misled.

seems like bad plan Thank kind words. really appreciate it. initial reply: mean tragic statement still true.

That said that. Reading must difficult overwhelmed righteous indignation reason. Serious question COVID. Won’t thing around vaccine? seems like states like Florida, Texas, Nevada, California delayed inevitable locking earlier Unlike real journalists, WaPo keeps wearing bias sleeve. Source go Oxford Uni (but English lol anything amazingly COVID related). bunch flyers around city, links sign study shared across private Facebook groups also via email. One shared called “Experiments Oxford” usually grad students offering amazon voucher take part small study. Hope helps! Yeah, I'm saying court absolutely would issue stay order look like science-denying jerks. Texas Panhandle gets cold, partially there's nothing block wind. Plus, higher elevation Hill Country (outside Austin) leads significantly lower temperatures. Still, that's beside point. Could be. I’m you. vaccine available sept, way take 16 months distribute UK unless foreseeing major distribution issues haven’t heard. 28 US states mask mandates now, well localities states don’t.

Yesterday HEB saw overweight guy shopping motorized shopping cart, three kids 'with' running around grabbing stuff, one kid mask hanging one ear fingers mouth. People inconsiderate, really surprise bad gotten. guess south Texas, since hot everyday, people bother wearing masks unless mandatory. almost like hot whole time they've lived they're used it. also matter family underlying conditions even though we're fat, horrible diets, drink alcohol every night, history diabetes. hot enough windows windows smoking cigarette everywhere go. #Puro956  walk store Denver right without mask shamed leave. see cops called. absolutely horrific.

I know things bad NY hospitals surge. bad? gotten lot answers multiple doses/person, helping developing world, etc. One thing people overlooked funding.

100 million doses may amount money wanted contribute towards project, inoculating (a percentage of) england figure they'll plenty options remainder. realize put billions companies, skyrocket stocks value. Every state specific governor basically looting response funds bullshit leaving people die. remember clap 8:00 p.m people thought would everyday stopped couple months lol.

I've done vaccine study, son one. actually get paid pretty well. $400 total pediatric study (which neat, rotavirus vaccine used pretty much everywhere US). guess clearer time frame. Basically getting vaccine still months away, still pass phase 2/3 testing. Considering drugs/vaccines fail phase 3 think bit premature celebrate good phase 1 results real test come last 2 phases. Americans even take vaccine. one county Georgia. lot rest state shithole. need wear mask 15-30 minutes time. Way show privilege get work comfort home day.

They setting many supply chains self contained within countries regions government can't step seize vaccines headed another country. Im safety nets, absurd era 7 billion humans subsidizing everyone starting families. like wanted shunt covid patients cover degree outbreak appear normal. I've many years State Auditors always vocal critical running, gotten tell. Sure enough, running. say like style tone I'll supporting. phase 3 trials efficacy.

You can't take mask eat drink lingering office, offices ability properly vent themselves. Well course Russia wants US UK succeed, else going hack research data from? vaccines kills even better change.org petition ever actually gotten anything changed? US likely going see spike cases. Thanks genuine laugh 😂 think USA'S federal government require masks, I'm entirely sure. said, several states starting require them. Texas mask mandate since July 2nd. Yeah, somebody asked Dr Salk patent vaccine? answer.. ""There patent.  Could patent sun?” 

Not try. lawyers said much chance, apply. Yes. Scientists revered gods society. Every single human earth owes people everything. bit sugar puts edge get diabetes.

Number 3 spot (as others especially number 3) antibody titers (pfizer) make AZ moderna look like children Actually funny. Sorry multiple user commenting hard follow. United States amendment called 10th amendment: power delegated federal government given states. 

So reality, United States could give mask mandate, doesn’t to. It’s completely states.  payments need converted rent/mortgage food relief least capped. Ridiculous people living partying every day getting $1200 week 4 month vacation. lot people bored going vacation shopping time spreading virus. saw post people waiting line social distancing sun hours get Ikea, think people working 40 hour week jobs time that? Meanwhile families seen dime relief.

People working $10 per hour jobs others want going get fed eventually unemployed folks keep getting 3x much. government better shutout working people again. ""security theater"". Exactly. see images workers spraying walls concrete sidewalks ""sanitize"" think ""wow resources could put much productive use fighting virus""... making masks? Authorities want make public show *something*, guess bunch people hunched sewing machines look good nightly news. country stupid. hate it. belief based history science, speculation best-case-scenario media bullshit. observation made Bret Weinstein, evolutionary biologist. notice myself, seems pretty self explanatory hindsight. Bret discovered unintentional selection pressures introduced artificial selection mice (The reserve-capacity hypothesis: evolutionary origins modern implications trade-off tumor-suppression tissue-repair, transfering idea viruses.  they’re like barely people. companies make decisions like this, reminded McConnell get #1 priority getting 5 year immunity shield businesses. take actions needlessly endanger employees; held liable. Yep that's valid point. wealthy likely first line, along essential healthcare workers. still concern, recent articles it? find daily articles Covid 19 related deaths. would definitionally impressive. Controls important though. vaccine trial without controls unscientific essentially worthless. sign trials receive control brave selfless get experimental drug/vaccine.  fair, think earliest hit places really totally wrong actions. America seeing nearly many cases every day China reported ENTIRE pandemic. Take may, time realized bad could be, Spain, Italy, New York, etc already bad. 

Personally think logic shows things China worse numbers let on, suppose can't prove that. /u/ChAdOx1

Someone it.

Edit: 71 days ago! Man early believer. I'm confused trying say. mean people think choice they're correct, people think choice incorrect? 

Also mean say ""some *you*""? referring Americans, Teachers, everybody world? ""you"" referring different group people? LOL sweethearts...you're getting Canada. Canada immigration restrictions intense makes US Mexican border look like jump rope. I’m glad someone is, usually get yelled “giving babies autism” said take get made joke covid. reading last night. 
It's absolutely horrific. 

Ants crawling intubated patients, using regular oxygen tanks VENTED patients (the nurse explained MENT needed changed hour two. far many people vents feasible) 

Just Jesus Christ america doing?  That’s bit much no? taught sub Saharan Africa 2 years. hot season, 112 fans, sitting outside(under thatch still) one died.

Not saying it’s comfy ideal Christ it’s life threatening grocery stores forced follow capacity limits churches, restaurants, schools closed due seen vectors spread, others required follow guidelines?

Seems disturbing lack logic around. contact known postive? Honestly would wait get results back mangers seem caring we're gonna let people die. comments keep getting sad. Keep going, keep trying make insecurities insulting someone internet. going bug me, let punching bag. Come big guy.

Next insult. I'm waiting. Sorry think needed /S /H hypocrisy.

Sorry suffering daughter gone through.   Eh, half South, trust me. half Midwest. 

North half state: hash browns. South half: Grits.  Bootheel: cotton fields. genuinely motivated overcome this, begin wearing mask minutes home first taking deep breaths relax yourself. Start long without severe anxiety. that’s 30 seconds, fine. Use comfortable cloth mask relaxing environment. goal remove much stress discomfort possible. 

Do exercise least times day - really often tolerate. soon able easily tolerate amount time, increase little bit. Don’t aggressive... goal teach brain wearing mask safe, want gentle yourself. little anxiety ok - you’re wanting avoid getting panic. 

If consistently, think you’ll find eventually wear mask shopping trips etc. without kind panic leads passing out. You’ll also feel empowered imagine. Honestly - make feel like badass truly, badass. 

If can’t tolerate exercise even seconds, encourage talk counselor specializes anxiety phobia work specifically. Many counselors telehealth appointments right now. help get initial hump. isn’t easy, sooooo valuable strengthen skills general.  No, makes cells produce antigen (the part virus/bacteria) triggers immune system produce antibodies (the part “disables” antigen) surprising point say insinuate that, still similar amount white black people wearing it. fun thing argument saying people wear masks listen black person. Yet lot anti mask people spoken quote Surgeon General Dr. Fauci originally said mask, time clearly false. doesnt sound like symptoms covid Ahhh, needed comment. It’s since coronavirus thread comment genuinely made laugh dark cynical way. Thank Mask mandates operate flawed logic   yet people thought put social media geotagging facebook/snapchat/instagram/tik tok/ etc.   Gotta attractive tho Carbon sequestration finding ways fix carbon products ground.

Sorry watching much wiggles kids  opinion though, would think NYC went first wave past that? cases now, rest USA exploding. San Francisco/Seattle issuing shlter-in-place order, guy going around recommending people wear masks. Beg want dude, part problem. Fair enough. giving study answer question. things take time I’m sure know. meant say stimulates T-cells B-Cells.
B-cells create memory plasma cells, means never deal chance reinfection again, unless vastly different mutated strain comes years/decades now. Working intended. dont kill us kill ourselves... course, usually get tox data ph1 even that's primary purpose. not? discussing second-order effects pandemic response. seriously censored word here? God forbid shame people trying kill innocent people. That's fair. similar concerns mRNA vaccine (I work pfizer vaccines, check news) simple terms, gets cells produce antigens rather inject antigens (ala traditional vaccines (basically)) fires immune system quickly too. nice part is, whatever antigen want make, cells make, there’s excess “junk” made well ie-only exact target antigen gets made, nothing else... Actually according hospital officials say mcallen.

Edit: funny said hospital overrun hallways full beds patients- yet patient hallway without 02 monitor seen. theyre overrun come see 30+ empty beds?

Not saying *all* bullshit. saying id love good full investigation till give full judgment.  Way, way, way late effective. Everyone need *except white people*

FTFY UK order 100 million vaccines population 70 million? Genuinely curious would case. one mass produced serum institute? setting many supply chains self contained within countries regions government can't step seize vaccines headed another country.

Thank you, that's better way putting trying say 2nd sentence. idea. think absence proper lock good idea. Countries fewer asks tend already got community transmission way down, they're less important never related comment reddit more. producing profit basis, cost hopefully low one. want know kind rings are, idea like it. Batch testing helpful high percentage infected people (at least simple batch testing)

If mix 100 samples tests negative, great, everyone go home. sample tests positive, know 1 person 100 people virus. So, test every single person again. course ways mix samples fancy ways, nevertheless general conclusion still holds. really effective fairly confident people virus. wife nurse hasn’t treated COVID patients directly worked closely 2 nurses tested positive antibodies. She’s convinced close proximity nurses, also antibodies would mean too. Neither us shown symptoms point gotten tested. seem likely got COVID point asymptomatic enough info tell? need community essential workers, get overshadowed voices drowned don’t time congregate make happen Healthy sheep, choking lump juice...

Sounds grand lad. go? googled see anything COVID vaccine trial failing phase 3. I'm asking exhaustive list, tou provide source specific vaccine failing phase 3? Here's link NYT vaccine tracker, looks like 4 currently planning phase 3, see anything one second this. for, days comes, I’ll probably get emotional. I’m shielding vaccine *true* way me. one deserves more! shame can’t kicked office gross negligence Also, forget Like Subscribe! looking code, will. pulls active cases per day Another idiot add list! Thanks! American businesses really like micromanage workers extract every possible moment work them. people work home watching shoulder day. brain drain 

Tha word mean think means. Brain drain people LEAVE place another. place LEAVE brain drain. 

Ex: workers decided leave Rainbow City move Westlake. Rainbow City brain drain. EVERYONE trying move Westlake, brain drain. pick best live there.

In order New Zealand ""brain drain"" people would LEAVE someplace else. brain drain people trying MOVE there. understand believing god Welcome reddit. don’t interact real world... cell response seem effective.

In case, quickly ridding Deep South dumb half population may lead better existence reasonable side. know OSHA employees said otherwise. kinda feel way US. 

Except remove bit bastion science innovation replace *a bit shit* *extremely shit*.

So basically love country despite utter shitshow. USA! USA! USA! completely unfounded speculation best straight fear mongering worst.

Sorry, assumed people basic knowledge situation would reply. chance ship couple thousand doses Philippines lmao need badly here. sanctuary states like USA? One issues could run lot people covid stopped producing antibodies weeks beating it. hopefully they've figured way around that, otherwise people might need booster every weeks, would logistical nightmare. expensive Americans shitty healthcare system. point people seen make biggest fuss wearing masks people going grocery shopping running errands. cases would need wear masks place business.

Doctors nurses wear masks entire 8-12 hour shifts complain wear outside work well. well aware occupations others need wear masks day. sorry way foreseeable future key protect others reducing spread. I'm saying country country standpoint. opinion nothing individuals acting, that's entirely separate issue Everyone downvoting seems like responses sincere enough, i.e seem like troll. So:

You say feel shitty someone working making *are* working. I'd like ask specifically makes feel way.

Do feel *they deserve* money, working all? feel like *you deserve more*?

Subtle difference, know. I'm legitimately curious. r/nursing, found one. GF works retail called back work upon first Los Angeles-area re-opening. pretty fearful since ventilation poor (though interior space large). wears NIOSH-certified N95 mask, covered ASTM level-2 surgical mask, wears face-shield top that.

Signs posted entrances informing customers masks required. Since large store many counters, distance-stencils/floor decals place, generally able distance serving customers. confronts customers wearing masks properly polite manner negative confrontations yet.

We're Westside Los Angeles County community where, thankfully, mask-compliance high. Also, city instituted fines wearing mask public. Yeah, meant sarcasm, truly feel. NY times good breakdown top contenders. go article linked says Novavax results early safety trials later month. NY times tracker :3 Well no. know much money get data sign petition? Nah Fuck him. Vaccine not, big reason mess. could personally bring set vaccines home family would still tell eat bag dicks. Sheep complaining. something. Dear USA,

And should, IMHO. 

*Takedown* (noun adjective) word meaning *take down* (transitive verb) . DHR? private hospital company?

Let’a hope it’s coming end finally party FUCK CORONA VIRUS without worrying bigger deal would think, 20 years ago SARS 2003 outbreak people researching cure 10+ years made progress.

And Oxford months seemingly process.  Back March April, Kemp put decisions regarding restrictions local officials. summarily reopened entire state specifically stated future decisions would come office. refused mandate mask wearing said going back shut-downs.

Two things - #1 can't ways. Either local officials responsible state level.

#2 appears want blamed shut-downs, wants full credit reopening. would okay, also accepted responsibility current surge across entire state. However, done everything blaming protestors manipulating data avoid accountability.

Conclusion: Kemp cheated way governor's mansion shown, without doubt, main concern lies large businesses undoubtably providing form compensation ignore health safety citizens Georgia order ensure golf buddies squeeze every penny system.

Basically asking nicely nothing required. republican Governor, he's done surprisingly well pandemic, never interested strict requirements travel masks, recommendation. Found American. I'll preface saying I'm expert, reading, well known types vaccines used widely today; live weakened virus inactivated virus (essentially virus dead injected bodies immune system ""learn"" disease create antibodies/t cells attack whenever encountered. Example: polio vaccine)

mRNA however, different fact actually trick body creating Cornavirus-like spike proteins (imagine spike protein virus sake simplicity) essentially body trains self make antibodies without putting body risk actually contracting disease, sort like fire drills run grade school.

Why important: 

1) Since synthetically created need genetic sequence virus begin working vaccine, dont need worry able grow disease lab, spending time studying weak virus still produce immune response. 

2) easier manufacture, storage/transportation ability concern 

and 3) could potent produce improved/longer lasting response compared ""live"" vaccine 

Again I'm expert others read this, please feel free critique Lol mate need go back school.one source? Lol I’m linking directly people news source.

And keep pushing goalpost retort childish insults like think it’s effective.

Oh say this

I show source wise

Wel guys say this

I show video guy saying opposite lol you’re pathetic told summer heat would solve everything. Also much time gets wasted patients navigate idiotic system. make homeowners policy claim get agent holds hand whole process. health insurance I’m own? larger, frequent claims complex system. Talking challenge-trial aspect. end month hit half million. Go Florida!

/s Certainly 

They’re insane. USA went upgrade full shit shit show less risk possibly getting sick (even though small) like normal vaccine? stupid cunt. grandiose statement 

It's easy talk big denial true risks. I'd surprised they'd say BS hospitalized dying. 


These people know enough afraid. Masks mandatory Maryland since end March/early April. recently establishments wear masks not- personally haven’t anywhere I’ve seen suggestion mandatory precaution study researchers St. George’s, University London found antibodies could remain stable infected person's blood two months diagnosis. study also found antibodies detected participants. Fire. Haven’t seen one right here. It’s cheaper less complex one driver whole route. I'm guessing people downvoting heard Kemp actually talk. understand feel trapped. chance able move Canada, anywhere else? something I've looked into, really know. way feel intentional? in, they've deliberately mishandled reason? Lol Karen wants talk manager GoFundMe.  True, many people saying it, meant ""This go away summer"" Say fuck off. Oh, gotcha. Saw headline yesterday doctor getting reinfected, I'm guilty actually reading full article. Ah yes. wise thing do, judge people typing cell phone grammar.

Interacting employers, customers, clients, etc make sure use proper grammar. Honestly even worth time communicating lemmings here. etsy soon feel like, things serious, consistent thing happening w/ pandemic everybody projects onto world what’s happening head:

“I look outside one WEARING MASKS DISRESPECTFUL everyone street TENUOUS RELATIONSHIP FATHER.” country shithole one? Agh! feels like something breaking right. Well fuck supposed get informed? 

Call you? 

Just ignore florida massive numbers? 

Why massive numbers people following mandates? 

I give shit random person says. goal get many people infected fast possible would quicker means.... perhaps instead spraying bleach could spray streets towns covid fog.... would quite fast. there's trillions dollars bail people made poor decisions money. atleast years worth expenses saved away 70C, 5-10 min sufficient, excess heat may damage mask repeated time. See  first oh mighty e-warrior. Haaayy name buddy. tl;dr Covid-19 first appeared 2013, 6 coal miners China developed mystery illness, caught bats. Samples virus taken kept lab Wuhan, eventually infected worker spread others. Freedumb choice wear mask spread covid. Freedumb cares little better working conditions economic mobility. Fluriduh isn’t shit list then? read something blatantly touch reality while. Absolutely right. That's like saying climate change real snowed today, people starving Chili's 2-hour wait. shake butts instead? absolutely astonishing much Marx must turning grave. Dudes gotta generating enough energy nuclear fusion now. 

All people arguing masks Marxist, alone absurd, advocating keep capitalist economy open crash upon actively killing workers. openly unironically advocating percentage population fed woodchipper necessary capitalism succeed. think pandemic anything shown matter rich country, still need competent governance cooperative citizens weather crisis. Countries contained spread well - like Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, New Zealand, etc. - vary greatly resources. resources, competent, science-based governance plus populace anti-science values collective safety - unfortunately lacking US current times (Source: Vietnamese living US extremely grateful parents third-world home country time). DMV area. There’s definitely pockets higher percentage people wearing them. Bill Gates combat pandemic entire federal government. 2020, crazy. I’m saying completely stoke fires conspiracy theory, would say probably close 40 50% deaths get skewed, remainder inability confirmed time due restraints supplies proper autopsy testing. Also without implementing testing every death track spread virus, leaves Wide margin error. Also, depending doctors hospitals, see increase death pneumonia, Alzheimer’s, comorbidities infected. CDC website good tracking deaths would say use guide precise percentage word alone Watch out, Karens! Probably not. record 15k+ week ago. Lol... insurrection, however election. Cry harder “In conclusion, [this vaccine] safe, tolerated, immunogenic..”

Now wait Phase III results. can't imagine going Magic Kingdom walking around without giant, delicious, juicy turkey leg. I'll wait vaccine. lot city schools tiny yards. school worked past year total outdoor space size basketball court. Pre-Covid wanted take students yard occasions (to collect primary data, etc.) told could 1 period day PE class going on. 

And recess done multiple shifts, half students indoors, half outdoors, switch. fun thing Wisconsin pissed us much voted spite. “Picture receiving vaccine holding cat” States adopted policies work people.

Doesn't seem working great. We're closing 70k new cases per day. Think system might working great? governor trying Kentucky actually well compared states around us. passed mandatory mask order much earlier many states. 

We hindered Attorney General uneducated idiots think mandatory masks infringing upon rights. Wait, [this look up. That's fucking stupid.

On different note snake oil sale brother, reduced arsenic cobalt. also formula provides 1000% daily recommended allowance benzene, know, benzene deficiency. No. friends, family community outreach programs help extending hand conditions could temporary.

Only doctors (in limited supply) help dying one help dead, important restrict two conditions times. Especially since one rather permanent.

Appalling. Oh yes, blessings guys sure. know would made story better? never gotten sick first place.

Too much preventable suffering country, least one cool couple survived. What's wrong. agree everything said. point possible bunch countries catch Sweden's numbers various reasons (just like 12 US states already do). US least extra 4-6 weeks act. mention greatest country. new york resident here, place

But nobody really took pictures them? 

It seems weird considering fresh ""novel"" everything March April. infamous Morgue Trucks.

But nobody took pictures post Facebook page say ""OMG! Covid Morgue Truck parked road me!""

It seems odd. Like told unicorns running around streets New York month, 4 photos them. That’s America you; baby world. Microchip cookies!  Phase II expanded cohort 55's 18's safety measurements included protocol. Phase 1 always uses strong healthy people safe likely survive. posts almost bad death cult Twitter posts ""Cases date symptom onset"" (which always shows decline due incomplete recent reporting) declares pandemic every damn day. Sunday, people. Come on. have, absolutely right. Right, guess that's specified I'm America...because could see shot costing us arm leg (even insurance plans) that's works here... Governors authority many mandating masks Governors like Brian Kemp Georgia. encourage masks worn blocking even suing cities counties mandated masks, enforcing ""Georgians right thing.""

My kid going college 2 weeks, city college mandated masks makes little less worrisome Governor actively blocking this, comforting.

FYI Kemp - Georgians right thing. Many going events without wearing masks socially distancing yes, mandates necessary many cases. guess what? Case going across Europe, even Japan masks worn like 95% rate. I'm saying wear masks, may panacea many think are. less called big cut pharma profiteers going demand allowing world become better place arguing troll. whispers. Phase 3 trials started last month. That's big problem sure, would expect test more... ""average"" population sample major pre-existing conditions done sub blows away. fucking house arrest ankle monitors signing piece paper. God people. can't believe anyone get behind Yeah. take care virus. I've heard Los Angeles, Texas Arizona also really cold winters, gone then.  know get along essential people life? I'm sad you. Even Tennessee took test took two weeks. first took negative, second positive. 1. Learn spell speak correctly, look like 10 year old.

2. going 1 source, links oxford vaccine therefore knowing full information, tempering expectation (which important stop people forget social distancing)

3. Go outside get fresh air. clearly need stop spreading melinformed negativity. vaccine enable body produce antibodies immune cells respond virus someone infected, help complications caused covid. damage likely result body's immune response original infection (I'm med student). I'll take Maybe stock market falls they’ll extend benefits France, Austria may bring back well. Google rest I'm bothering further.

Because thing ridiculous statement. Austria quit making mandatory cases went down. US cases roof. US absolutely fucked up, read despite missing lockdown masks, Swedens cases going well.

Mandatory masks not, US government screwed general response harder European country. Idk could missed that. understanding Oxford already using probably safe platform, trials much efficacy safety. Unlike United States countries leaders useless trash cares reelection luckily unlikely happen. Yeah manage Covid Paracetamol. /s even close Yes high school Florida saw thunderstorms every day half semester, packed two thousand kids across three grades, regular tornado warnings/drills, that’ll fine outdoors. Maybe could set tents! humanity ever reached herd immunity disease 

Sure. usually takes decades centuries, 'herd' survives heavily decimated. 

I can't believe argument herd immunity got far. Diseases remorselessly scythe population years type herd immunity takes over. Even horrific diseases 'unsustainable death rates' like plague ebola still come waves finish within one year. 


It really exemplifies people's preference convenience idolization inaction guise laissez faire deep wisdom. really wish could finished school, honestly point would acomplish. Id get sick, get deploma could go college take money less pay off. u.s. sucks I'm always stunned people feel like personal power make decision whether people live die. may biased though healthcare goal harm protect many people possible.

What frustrates measures: stay in. wear piece fabric mask. go crowded places even feel like 'missing out,' small, relatively unimpactful annoyances deal - seems hit lizard brain people go 180.

I'm beyond frustrated. I'm also human, (I think?) I've making tons sacrifices myself, hard people dancing people's theoretical graves order ... 'save economy.' we? Angels life death also economists now?  Big took care reporting numbers take big dip soon change headline ""Conspiracy theorists prove coronavirus cases under-inflated placate masses.""   Places like northern NY would like word. Hey kids gonna negative 10 windchill today. fun outdoors day school! long willing adjust believe based evidence reason cool fam, fuck upvotes do? mean, yeah, do. Everyone the, um, meeting, discussed agreed upon. guy talking front missed it, could repeat part me? feds can't much enforce it.

You gonna put federal agents mask duty? bumfuck sheriff nopes it, theres nothing do. Dogs, oppressed black Americans, poor, sick, low income workers, Spider-Man, Keanu Reeves...ya kno. Well local government encouraging it. Close beaches, bars, restaurants, malls, theme parks. lockdown. Close airports. Put checkpoints highways. stop coming Culture makes feel bad single. There's actually alot merits. Nice circular logic. actually listening numerous people actually live know what’s going on. personally know people gotten sick - likely covid - denied testing. would likely denied testing got it. incredibly hard get tested even you’re sick. 

They need hospitalize everyone tests positive infectious disease law, tested widely would ensure system overwhelmed. aren’t testing, cases. idea you’re acting like aren’t. since Florida playing games tests actually believe anything say point?  Wages general shit majority people. worked 70+ hours per week chef, give job didn’t cover 2 kids daycare also made work daycare closed (Nights, weekends, holidays, days kids sick). It’s sad we’re significantly better one income 2. pulled bootstraps hard nearly hung ‘em. Country broken, we’re broke it. get worse border patrols still believing Americans interest going Alaska. Americans can't even point place map let alone drive there. Canada already cases thoughtless Americans. time lock fix mess. Well right isn’t rich brainwashed thinking immigrants people color reasons poor Let’s fuckin go boys Outdoor activities like protests shaping low risk whereas dude breathing head indoors 20 minutes HIGH risk. 

Stop trolling it’s low effort ineffective. understand swedish see text one slides shown video. minor leeway ones want wear time ones really see danger wearing indoors public transportation. honestly think get everybody wear one sidewalk. specially hot getting. UK 30 million UK due ready September, guess countries timeline good news least phase II people still around, results would useful end.

However, particular instance think merit balancing question long-term health effects vaccine uses well-established technologies targeted new virus vs. long term effects novel disease able directly infect basically every major organ body (including brain).

It definitely still risk, personally would prefer roll dice new vaccine flavor. places US, especially places covid outbreaks, high rates mask wearing *whether mandated*. Seems like politicising taking action it’s needed (not mask also lockdown COVID rules) seem work. Funny, uh.

Pretty sure there's major push German media make masks wearing partisan political issue. Pretty sure Germans high degree social conformity relative US start with. Pretty sure huge number factors differentiate US Germany, like IDK population, urban rural divide, name few.  Let's start big box stores get traffic. way,that would make way much sense.  I'm similar, less severe situation compared you. company truly encouraging work home, well sending potentially sick people close contacts home. 

I go HR reiterate responsibility provide safe working environment. (people workplace wearing masks we've many cases on-site) Since begun reprimanding wear masks. 

Hopefully HR department step management failed, safety employees, least avoid legal ramifications.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope motivates people go managements heads necessary/possible least provide safer working environment people privilege working home. school worked last year planning graduation ceremony inside church next week. split class two groups allowed kid six people could bring. 75 kids per group + six people per person. Potentially 400 people. planning two ceremonies like this. actions overwhelmingly illogical, makes wonder whispering bosses ear. suspicion every time hint post gets deleted robot. say, another country starts P ends n. shit there's need something money think orphan drug designations exist, facts wouldn’t they? There’s literally studies put worldwide confirm mask usage slows infection rates drastically decreases ones chance getting virus. 

Maybe open mask whatever fuck currently clearly isn’t working considering we’re infected country world right now. Coincidentally we’re also country prominent Anti-Mask movement. Weird correlates huh? completely missed point trying make. criticized testing Sweden point mentioned numbers alarming headline make be.

I think Sweden's response poor, especially compared neighboring countries. there's lot people trying make worse actually is. Especially slowing try really hard make seem bad.

Like get it, Sweden fucked we're paying price it. everything's going right direction people still shitting us. gives? get lot half picture. 

The dollar amount tax paid corporations individuals income earned foreign countries minimal compared dollar amount domestic earnings. 

And articles states, income tax one component taxes paid. (and extension you) clearly read article. Nobody dies school problem last year? different cause? Imo would better school home indefinitely.

Lawyers usually 1 2 things matters. Risk-averse ""Fuck infringement rights"" neither bode well civil disobedience. Actually, cases tests reinfections animals, showed animals got milder form virus month first time cases Fair point. Follow up- people count US adopting similar strategies?

Never heard one before, gave chuckle. Lol. well could corrupt bribe it, think that. guess I'll stay home rest life  guy sucks bad, even elected people position got Governor much worse. Missouri sucks 2 big bastions communities progressive values KCMO St Louis, rest state filled ignorant backwards ass rednecks like outnumber us city, Southern MO definitely Bible belt country. Sorry anyone's offended true. happened... mRNA vaccines essentially generic loader whatever RNA want train immunity for. set configured load data pieces coronavirus, type whatever want. don’t even need sample virus, genetic code someone else sample. 

New virus appears, scientist area gets genome posts online, someone halfway around world types data vaccine printer, goes BRRRR, vaccine done.

If works, might last time ever wait months vaccine new disease. Exactly. Theres way mRNA get body's cells duplicate bot much loophole. would buy enough food eating day disney, could buy Tesla? No. Certainly undereducated people clueless. well life common sense lot decency. fact, good friends like this. 

Those lack common sense, human decency IQ shown behaviors plague rats, know sure dumb even finish school. people laughing stock country literal world absolutely problem ridiculing well. Well estimation pretty correct, considering 4 months ago said hundred thousand deaths, currently 600 thousand dead.  could Medicare All.

We profoundly screwed. basically stay hotel Maine, need negative COVID test? Lots subs reporting masks getting dirty looks Hey man, us idiots don’t want associated ignorant douchebags  Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte said Italy first locked down: “We remain apart now, embrace strongly tomorrow.” (Clunky translation copied news article.) updoot! Gilles claims real reason refused wear mask medical conditions exempt requirement. 

Lobotomies side effects. There’s number reasons, biggest probably leader Republican Party dictating terms means republican.

Another reason however they’re dominated business community, business community extremely short-sighted. Especially poorly ran businesses need constant clash stay afloat. answer confused me, although I'm scientist may why. 

The first two articles link mention Yosemite sewage test all, understand think contradict results. looks like virus present time doctors recognized it. nothing wastewater analysis.

Yes, looks like Biobot created new technology, although they've already using track opioids wastewater. scientific article yet peer-reviewed, study needs done. kind analysis done look reemergence polio, too: seems find virus water, there-- that's easy part. Determining means (if any) policy recommendations come it, that's job localities order test.

And trust Big Pharma all, small company that's working non-profits provide useful scientific data public health officers. Absolutely need find unity. argument people argue unity focusing structures white supremacy exist. never unite black people disproportionately incarcerated, black people consistently gunned down, choked death, beaten wheelchair allegedly carried firearm, spite seriously armed protests allowed exist. problem, impossible deny. let's focus problem, let's absolutely start law enforcement. Maybe good system policing, looks different now, look legislation targets POC, drug immigration laws, look elections stop restricting poor black vote gerrymandering lack polling stations open hours stations. Maybe black votes matter we'll see local policy making decisions interest helping people break poverty. eliminate truly revolutionize white supremacy institutions, live unity. me, white person, BLM actually they’ll ramp production everyone get vaccine, it’ll global effort subreddit really needs stop talking vaccine available September one India TV news article. BBC article concerning [Oxford vaccine immune clearly states:

"" possible coronavirus vaccine proven effective end year, however, widely available.""

"" However, widespread vaccination likely be, earliest, next year even everything goes plan. ""

It's nice positive all, let's Facebook telephone game fake news thing.

Edit - Downvote want, give shit. [AstraZeneca saying since MAY ready roll-out 400 million doses vaccine mean effective vaccine, capacity large scale manufacturing distribution. didn't. error. Call insurance. conveniently forget guy kill releasing personal collection zoo animals. .... ... Ya... Midwest Florida. lucky lawyers good disagreement. everyone luxury. Ontop date people similar values to. luxury &amp; times stress cause problems. Canada ordered two doses. federal government ordered 75 million sets syringes, alcohol swabs, bandages gauze, 250,000 needle disposal containers. Basically equipment needed deploy vaccine 2 doses, actual vaccine. people need understand going on. clearly entirely liability. companies inheritors owns wants companies put entire responsibility government regarding regulations that's followed. turns wrong send liability lawsuit government entities made mandates. 

this allow wear n95 mask. first mask found faulty who's liable that? there's potential company work fault clearly provide n95 mask. better wear wear all? company follows government mandates anything bad comes it, liability lawsuits go directly government. 

it's classic case socializing lost (liability lawsuit) privatizing profit work. Trying get better place like holding mirror makes people see honest way people like see. easier try break mirror fix themselves. sustained, control transmission going right US. way stop slow testing hope disappears November. curious, what's hiccup? 

Is chance everyone else wear it, feels awkward hip person room? That's Denmark anyway. mandatory yet, merely recommended, thusly one wears 'em. 

Which way I'm always wearing industrial P3 model. Oh, dirty looks get, gives toss, right? like lung capacity. I'm definitely pro-mask stoop hyperbolic level. normalizing term making easier things like protests labelled terrorism. everyone always asking, ""if infections high, deaths correlate?"".....you're saying correlating. know am. place circle jerk disaster porn lovers, US haters, Trump haters, etc. 

I would concerned views agreed here. reddit people downvote disagree with, dont mind. People allowed express views use sites mechanics this.

I also going change believe say preserve (or gain) artificial currency. God bless America. #1 Corona C U Next Tuesday Michigan checking in. Like idea, going little cold snowy winter always. Plenty room teach frozen lakes, really shut schools go online plz. :D specifically mRNA vaccines? could potentially used create universal flu vaccine? maybe even common cold vaccine? dig term vaccine printer discussion. whoever wants read fascinating thing would suggest term ""RNA printer"". 

The BRRRR takes weeks produce manageable amount target RNA.

I know generic loader already included then, yeah - works would new vaccine.

The thing find interesting versatility. Oxford vaccine train immune system fight spike protein. know lot disease MO body could basically string together number proteins like checklist immune system elicit immune response them. times like believe separate penalty disqualifies ability vote election cycle.

This action clearly shows individuals care fellow citizens damage they're wreaking upon economy.

Why allowed vote? Holy shit don’t know start. Forty days later try school Fox News article?!? LOL. didn’t even prove point though...because 1) article says antibodies last *at least* three months..which actually closer proving point 2) initial article immunity, specifically antibodies, informed reader would know components immunity outside antibodies. NFL eventually throw bunch money testing resources order players feel safe. league PA agreed mandatory 3 week IR designation player testing positive finalizing helmets designs players helmets equipped masks visors. players definitely pushing back, team gets expanded rosters 65-70 players per team offset infections, PA definitely sign that.

There NFL season, albeit without fans like Premier League soccer. There’s way much money stake cancel season. graduated system really need time UI state benefits. Actually, I'd really like see UBI instead.

There's 70+ research papers saying mask work, 1 says mask make worse, sure mean ""nothing proven conclusively."" seem pretty conclusive me. think overestimate graduation requirements schools... apparently AstraZeneca planning 2 billion doses ready September imagination full older straw men, maybe projecting onto entire generation reason? older people know much looking forward (safe) vaccine. think that's part upsets much.

Please note “early on” means “after figured PPE shortage hospitals.” still fighting chance avoiding spike juncture. one hour old article incorrect? Better let BBC know. agreement AZ supply 400 million doses vaccine *when available*. vaccine available.

Guess hungry people stores enough money buy groceries loved ones. Bruh isn’t conspiracy. It’s super simple, they’re testing. isn’t conspiracy man. 

It’s also certainly impossibility. death proportionate slightly higher number infections. entirely possible people treated recovering covid without tested. 

I’m saying it’s rampant, killing everyone. I’m saying there’s lack transparency that’s concerning. That’s all. think you’re used arguing Americans think wearing mask communist plot something. everything conspiracy. Incompetence real Japan king incompetent governments.

This science political conflict interest dangerous challenges man kind faces. also assume large portion COVID-19 deaths aren’t counted due problems accurately reporting deaths crisis.

The chart interesting may help inform COVID-19 deaths crossing wires death causes, data cannot say that— total— COVID-19 deaths reported. highly unlikely circumstances. ""Chad, virus killing people horrible pandemic, need vaccine ASAP""

Chad: OK. Probably not. Crimes commission clearly condemn-able crimes omission.

These people suck, aggressively harming Americans directing American officials take action them. Though apparently Trump also DC Portland. even ones thrilled restrictions masks probably need daycare aspect bad enough comply.

Yup. friend pro-mask pro-common sense restrictions. also probably first person circle friends take coronavirus seriously (stocking masks back early February). stuck home months kids also pro-REOPEN SCHOOLS GOD PLEASE HURRY.

Immunity covid-19 high 40 percent Stockholm, according Director General Johan Carlson Swedish Public Health Agency. Norwegian researchers believe conclusion may drawn far.

The Director General Johan Carlson Swedish Public Health Authority Friday morning made statement immunity covid-19 high 40 percent Stockholm, writes Swedish Dagens Nyheter.

The newspaper writes corona situation improved, number serious cases covid-19, number deaths per day number patients intensive care unit continue decline. 

- **I think drawn conclusion little far. possible true, full-fledged data substantiate even today, says Gunnveig Grødeland, researcher Department Immunology Transfusion Medicine University Oslo.**

#Suggests 20 percent may cells

According Johan Carlson, proportion people antibodies Stockholm 17.5 20 percent. 

Another 20 percent inhabitants capital believed so-called T-cell immunity, according Swedish Public Health Agency refers new Swedish study, writes Dagens Nyheter.

Researchers Karolinska Institutet Karolinska University Hospital show many people mild symptoms symptoms coronavirus immune, despite fact antibodies body. due cells.

- *What think calculation?*
 
- comes formed relevant immune responses, realistic. Carlson uses starting point estimates 20 percent antibodies, correspond well seen from, example, New York affected parts Italy, says Grødeland.

On top that, adds 20 percent reckons T-cell immunity. slightly uncertain number, adds.

#Believes cells necessarily provide protective immunity

Immune responses always generated exposed viral infections. two main types immune responses protect viruses antibodies so-called cells.

Grødeland says Swedish Public Health Agency assumes cells formed exposed SARS-CoV-2 people therefore protected. 

- premise. actually number studies, more, show exposed various cold viruses, among things, also form T-cell responses Covid-19.

**Nevertheless, far possible prove cells protect, whether formed common cold virus SARS-CoV-2, according Grødeland.**
 
- None researchers study claim says anything protection. shows reactivity among relatively study participants, ie cells recognize coronavirus.

**- One cannot draw conclusion far mix relevant reactivity protective immunity, always case, emphasizes. **

#OUS researcher: Must careful calculation
- **To conclude published Sweden, prevalence twice large one thought, think drastic conclusion fully understand.**
 
This OUS researcher Fridtjof Lund-Johansen says. nevertheless believes Swedish study important, brings forward important observation.

At time, says one careful draw strong conclusions.
 
**- difficult conclude, much difficult measure T-cell immunity measure antibodies results measurements differ published articles, says Lund-Johansen.** 


He refers recently published study [Nature]( states cells found people corona disease.

**After publication, Lund-Johansen emphasizes VG everyone cells, cells recognize coronavirus.** 

- appears many 30 percent cells without corona. consequence difficult use results data time T-cell immunity able calculate spread virus population, comments Fridtjof Lund-Johansen.

- currently difficult want make estimates it. virus pain relieving properties. dad also problem. He's 64, still works office. age, he's already higher risk, luckily he's also extremely healthy.

Still, let work home even though job could EASILY done home, reason.

I lucky I've working home since March, see companies allow it, pisses fuck putting others danger reason.

Shit, company's policy REQUIRED work home, come office, security asks there. legitimate reason, allowed in. want anyone anywhere near office pandemic. teach Canada provinces (10) territories (3), states, Toronto city Ontario? 

When google ""Canada coronavirus deaths"", says 8852 top, lists ""Quebec, Ontario, Montreal, Toronto, Alberta"" adding 9699. Two cities, leaves 7 provinces, double counts Toronto (and reason 0 deaths Montreal, even though lot, although already included Quebec number). People couldn’t take single quarter economic downturn, even saved us long term. Instead learning lesson, people STILL protesting lockdowns today. Smaller towns better less people smaller towns usually full folks believe it’s hoax. town recently first death cases soaring. hope it’s close waking everyone realize real dangerous actually is. wish México would this. live Puerto Vallarta nothing locked down. like swedes could build pretty effective coronavirus strategy country taking look US federal government tried, opposite. Oh definitely know everyone who's flippant there. everyone taking seriously.

I really feel you. really sucks knowing representatives abandoned neighbors completely different page. hope silver lining mess everyone believes dismantling public services ignoring science get wake call.

I hope family get this. I'd like point hardest hit neighborhoods across world poor, america means predominantly black

just saying saying without risk, appear safe possible.

So key. one NEEDS Disney World, agree without risks open up. Soooooo they're state one worst outbreaks country sign slowing down, think would best err side caution keep park closed? really, REALLY understand people defending all. unnecessary risk, people turn around wonder can't get control virus. people keep taking unnecessary risks paying it. Right, sitting outside 15 degree weather come November it’s snowing... better start planning now. would never listen anything NPR Alabama's 7 day average deaths time high

Edit: actually, Florida's  low standards.  Maybe I'm dense, way see baseline pneumonia death rate time past years? I'm seeing it, think useful indication true excess reported pneumonia/flu deaths. 
 
Also, worry type data unreliable unavailable going forward Trump administration shunting hospital data away CDC. absolutely something special covid. minor cold, still fully understood virus strain seen before, that's shown cause inflammation blood vessels, low oxygen absorption, long recovery time people. treating cavalierly, getting covid days sniffles. people, there's way predict body respond it. could ok, could die. high risk die covid. old die covid. 100% healthy still die. there's way predict this.

Also stay away kids solution. kid touch something, touch later, bam got covid. interact kid get sick kid. Tennesseean here. governor could mandate penalty felony 90% neighbors would wail libs taking freedoms protest city hall ghost AR's - without masks, course. They're STILL going ""hurr durr China lied"" - well Jimbo, stop anyone else handling - can't blame China fuckup. Governor Kemp, Georgia, actively trying kill people. He’s suing Atlanta mayor get mask mandate removed he’s trying force courts restrain ability press conferences speaking press general she’s outspoken idiot is. stealing election wasn’t enough reason hate him... Doctors nurses actually less likely contract virus regular citizen.

As weird sounds, they're high risk. 

I still think would make sense vaccinate use PPE extreme, simply talking infection rates. important conversation -\_- Stop trying police comments. Let people say whatever want to. Maybe, viruses dry dusty. since coming someone's warm moist lungs suspended moisture droplets. get trapped masks.


Even 100% effective still better 0% effective ends. everything coated. 

Which makes precautions effective. Wasn’t whole purpose lockdown first place? protect elderly? governor’s direct infected patients admitted nursing homes hospitals set reason? (Javits center, USNS Comfort). not. u.s. losing world reserve currency status. always happens spend much. eventually  isn’t asymptotic then, sorry. Surely detect sarcasm without needing /s

Right? kid begging go summer camp. Could say yes. may regret it, think bigger regret would lose child child loose parent (prematurely) said developed countries handling responsibly. guess key most. giving example developed country south america handled poorly  Could like small pox, found people caught cow pox immune small pox.  get all. ""Well diabetes thats killed them."" Um. No. drop dead well managed diabetes reason. Like earthquake someone diabetes gets trapped collapsed building hope rescue, matter end dying, whether crushed, lack insulin, lack food water, etc would say earthquake killed them, diabetes. That’s encouraging! I’m hoping see town eventually hasn’t happened yet.... every one dies? imagine it’ll go straight Toronto avoid that. important really hope rest states decide limit travel places point. confronted quietly waited line atm last week. wearing mask 350 plus pound Karen told must weak. Well, yes, discharged week hospital pancreatitis. hold tongue regret told quite obvious eating science mind business. Well that's kind problem it? leaders voted disproportionately people refusing wear masks spreading virus. Ofc also without rigging elections case Georgia. „masks don’t work“ discussion Germany too. done pretty good job handling pandemic people seem forget low infection rates. 4 weeks total shutdown masks simply works. 

Thanks r/masks4all subreddit invitation btw. really appreciate it. that

I guess stopped people saying it, judging downvotes. sources back up, know people gotten virus - personally, online stories - gone ANYWHERE without mask socially distanced 100% time. Tested positive, weeks symptoms, etc. wearing mask 6 feet apart someone necessarily good enough. article written today, that'd bit issue.

It's posted today various treatments HIV, cure stop progression. Deaths dropped significantly. Greetings Florida.  bad there’s coin shortage rn :( Can’t survive isn’t room you... Go bury head sand facts disturbing fragile sensibilities. stupid be? entire article nothing US Dollar becoming worthless. It’s collapse America society. know serious, newspapers generally (with exceptions) singing praise Tegnell FHM. ""of course print negative articles positive"" really work describing Swedish media (if anything, way many positive articles way negatives, maybe general reports like one many critical reports). least compared media countries. Again, think agree.... still, throw political jab end nice little fuck anyone would listening. whole point making damn political issue can't anything right (to virus US lately).

In words. Suggesting could worth trying focus getting preschool - ""5th"" graders back schools first, allowing older work online come next phase great. makes sense likely able stay home and/or comprehend/follow things online computer-based environment. 

That inconvenient choice KNOW needs made. one would argue that. 

But saying conceding irrational compromise deaf fools keep KIDS home which... makes whole thing bipartisan lover's quarrel tees resistance anyone listening you, concerned child's education ability parent work. mindful this. Seriously. Whether THINK echo chamber. 

If really believe, seem saying, make ""inconvenient choices"" order find middle-ground children stay home quarantine getting children back school system... stand that. Make stand inconvenient choices expect others same. 

Or... think rational approach instead keep kids in-person school system defined point, cannot allow children physically school system, say instead. say one use attack others. Otherwise, effect, deafening ears talking to. Neocolonialism says yes they’re purpose hits poc poor hardest. point. self centered, terrorist. go symptoms, regardless whether tested, terrorist intend incite terror spread biological contagion.  would imagine Florida gets act together, Florida tourist US coming (and people prefer going to) one States worst job control. America worked hard turn society market, lesson learned damage remains. 20,000 day matter? 100,000 day matter? people charge dont think sick/dead people issue number change anything. long DeathSentence still getting ata boys pop pop Trump toe line. BocaNewsNow.com first reported teacher student infections last week, complete photos showing teachers partying together without social distancing. teachers, according multiple sources, attended party student’s house.

These teachers going partying instead careful.

I've concerned kids spreading covid schools, forgot decent amount teachers fuckin suck could something stupid like cause outbreak That's crazy! get results within 3-4 days southern California shoe fits Well let's put way, courts start processing evictions (nothing actually prevented landlords filing paperwork) going housing nightmare make 2008 look like kiddie pool. 

Meanwhile DC politicians can't agree sending money Americans meanwhile IRS sending money dead people. Still waiting first check BTW... Botswana got Covid control cheap. pool 20-25 samples together, test individual samples pool comes back positive. Saves money. Saves tests. Improves turn around time. What's like? Normally comments would make real upset. Risking canadian population we’ve worked hard get virus out. this? understand. Hopefully vaccine thing starts change insane USA medical prices That's really weird conclusion come with. yet, basing feelings, data. Gotcha. don’t like bother reading every “news.com” sites ‘cause you’re right, they’re usually repackaged shit blatant lies.  Lmao, yeah ask Covid infested aid country can't even anything hurricane victims. What, Americans going throw kitchen rolls us natural tragedy strikes? last paragraph particularly point. alone feeling like this. pandemic kind put lid boiling pot overwhelming hopelessness lot us already struggling with. Wish could offer something commiseration, sometimes feels like way relate anyone world. Guess thing hold hope something better comes along eventually. wish best hope give searching something good life. try hard yourself, becoming apparent we're struggling survive society designed anyone top. people try argue counting non-covid related deaths covid 19 shows even trying inflate numbers much possible significant.

If follow cohort 4 million around 3 months, 7000 die, 140000 died there's something obviously killing people. antibodies seem fade faster milder cases. milder case also suggests innate immune system able fight virus. case antibody levels relevant forms immune system protection like cells. Even catch virus second time likely less severe Miami start fining people last week? Heparin also potential side effect uncontrolled bleeding. It’s great drug take “pro-actively” case discover conditions thinned blood would cause severe issues. know someone go heparin clotting disorder ended stomach ulcer hemorrhaging nearly died result. heparin must monitored careful medications even *foods* thin blood further.

Please don’t let Trump start touting next “cure”. Seems common southern states take 7 -14 days I’ve seen story many times. It’s always friend friend. Never real name. People eager hate Disney realise pretty much entirely safe conditions in

I mean, really. know virus transmitted via aerosols - meaning building sick people puts risk. people wearing masks cuts risk lot, guarantee, personally feel comfortable standing anywhere near COVID positive person unless absolutely to. know anyone would willingly go place like Disney right now. see upvoted bots, way reasonable intelligent person would come conclusion.

Actually violating Rights others selfish, gullible idiotic time.

Want something really violates ones Rights...look Trump private police starting invade US cities. 

Oh wait, bothered least that. anyone's ""Rights"", buying words traitor. protect ego.

Just wear fucking mask bottom feeding troglodyte. maybe return sort normalcy, worry less asshole like killing immune compromised daughter. already endure 2 open bypass surgeries, 7 million medical bills. even read it? Sounds like sign specific wording pertaining emergency transportation instead revisiting documentation placed house arrest. Maybe details come later, that's that's known right now. Swedish testing also skyrocketed since May, deaths per day continuously gone down. Logically, confirmed cases increased, sum confirmed unconfirmed gone down. Starting pay increased new teachers, teachers teaching 20 years haven’t seen increase. Veteran teachers make 2k year new ones...  do? Sure, testing free go right place insurance. One many problems healthcare US it’s always easy find clinics free, don’t take 5 hours test you, give results reasonable amount time.

I insurance afford pay needed employer would understanding needed half full day tested. still spent week trying find test city didn’t cost fortune I’ve waiting 2 weeks results. can’t imagine someone fewer resources flexibility trying find free test, potentially without insurance, limited time.

TLDR: “free” misnomer, accessibility problem, results time important piece well No. banned travel get us prepared deal with. opened borders July 1st, rethink quickly. think middle class US lives better life Europe. live bigger, newer houses taxes lower afford stuff. Yeah stuff equal happiness means, hurt. one thing careful of, trusting extreme news source. Reddit far left, trust anything read would far right. sides like highlight worst things show bad side is. reality generally far that. expecting better country leaders bad thing? kid fails test tell need work harder better mean hate them. facts spend far health care developed world worse results. case need better.

I hate US, feel incredibly lucky born here. However, serious issues health care system need fixed saying unpatriotic bad. honest. TEACHERS: obese change diet make healthier decisions SAVE LIVES would genuinely one phenomenal achievements history mankind vaccine September chance.

Only Murican's love Trump. True Americans can't wait rid him. DeSantis Trump Lite. Cracks beer *merica*  
The Nordic country responsible closed borders Sweden. Sweden chose herd immunity strategy threatens safety neighbors chose suppress / Test, Trace, Isolate. Thus, Sweden's neighbors little choice close borders. two weeks reopening parts Sweden, Denmark seeing [uptick Could coincidence? Sure. timing makes one go “hmm”. 

Is terrible Harparanda / Tornio (which basically one city divided border) currently separated? Yes. isn’t “Helsinki’s” fault it’s Stockholm’s. probably make masks mandatory public transport/shops, COVID comes way fall. moment fine. Altogether 18 people left hospital care country - c.600 - highest number people tested world besides two Gulf states. absolutely btfo automod political hate US healthcare though? be. i'm fiscally conservative yeah hate people fuck money hate usually goes towards government, hate things cost wayyy should. would case here.

Finland receives sharp criticism closed borders Sweden corona pandemic. former Minister Rural Affairs member Nordic Council Ministers' Border Barriers Council Sven-Erik Bucht believes Finland regional solution Swedish Tornedalen.

Once issue comes Trump backing Fauci experts subject. whole tracker thing blows mind (I don’t know I’m surprised anymore) post social media time phone watch 100% track time think government cannot organize stop pandemic secretly implanting trackers you? Ha. Nah already proven 99.9% COVID cases come indoors. Outdoors perfectly safe. Coronavirus teach good lesson think. encouraged masks, mandated. always November. 

Historically, Americans *always* vote re-election years according wallets. economy well November, re-elect president. isn’t, elect challenger. Consistently throughout American history pattern always held true. I’m saying makes sense it’s clear pattern. 

The WH miscalculated thought virus would slow enough could let states thing without taking responsibility lockdown, slow enough get summer, force every state reopen use economic “recovery“ secure win virus spread control. point even Trump might ordered another lockdown election secure. 

Everything we’re going one man wants feel like powerful person world longer. Mask mandates place wherever hot spots are. Businesses pretty strictly regulated. place see spike covid transmissions personal parties, happen time south Florida honestly. It’s summer, lots people lost jobs. lots essential workers getting it. I’m sorry essential workers need stress relief recreation. Closing would really curb anything. can’t speak U.K. confidentiality laws, say several ways health providers US work home without violating HIPAA putting patient information sort security risk. happening. old game, taking advantage current climate push classic agenda voter suppression. totally agree fucked Patriot Act is. many Americans. There's call insults lumping us together one group. Childish name-calling going convert anyone cause.  Oh fucks sake 100,000 people dead protests. Find new talking point already Yeah shit show state South, amirite?

Perennial whipping boy Texas issued statewide mask mandate 2 weeks Colorado. Underdogs Louisiana Alabama also squeezed powerhouse Colorado week day, respectively.

That fuckin South...  US bad EU good upvotes left Neutralising antibody responses 32 (91%) 35 participants single dose measured MNA, 35 35 participants (100%) measured PRNT. 

I’m far scientist, sounds like good news! Excited see results Phase III look like. Ready unsubscribe sub. actually makes sense little like AIDS, body dies AIDS, defense left protect anything else.
Everywhere gouvernements trying make numbers look good instead actually fixing problem, Mexico, Brazil US top. damn clever people there. worked Walmart years ago, allowed call Black Friday. sincerely hope that's changed light pandemic. mad, taking utterly stupid position feel smug.  it’s good spreading. 

In first world medical environment (yet). spreads fine limited medical care. Easter He's got strategy. fucking grim one, he's got it.

""Starve beast"" mentality every social program. watch flop around like dying fish poke fun say ""SEE! SOCIALISM WORK!"". 

We see playing right schools. He's trying force everyone go back in-person, k-12 higher ed, Mitch keeping getting extra funding implement social distancing safety measures even additional cleaning supplies...and Devos creaming pants idea public schools failing private/charter come save day.

We see playing immigration, naturalization happening via drive-thru right even delays, USCIS needs huge cash infusion stay afloat layoff/furlough 70% staff, causing even delays legal immigration.

We see playing right now, taking CoVID reporting away CDC hands private company (on no-bid contract, less) data manipulated however wants gets desk.

No doubt totally okay base dying means libs stay home election day.

Best case would 10 million doses day. reach would require every single company manufacturing capabilities make vaccines.  Wonder pandemic would turn Hillary white house instead Meanwhile we're people melt businesses choosing make masks mandatory there's clear direction government level infection rates getting worse.  US government screwed general response harder European country. Idk could missed that.

Depends think pandemic ends work backwards today... Someone's throwing hat dumbest GOP Governor competition.

He sure lot competition though. 

Gov. Mike Parson: “These kids got get back school.... get COVID-19, — go school — they’re going hospitals.... They’re going go home they’re going get it.”  insulting boy Ikit Claw. 1,5m crock. Particles diffuse lige that. sound guideline would 6-8m, would *probably* work one's favour. Outside, is. Inside aircondition running, everybody feasts. don’t, uneducated prediction. Although, know things human condition say people seem much optimistic ignoring social dynamics humanity living moment. probably sound cynical pessimistic, would call realist. deep hope I’m wrong this.  like real Twilight Zone episode everyone going like 2019 there's friggin' pandemic going on! kind car have? Juat live stream reddit ask help ppl join help you! science rules!  Yah I'm sure people think masks unconstitutional oppression government would inclined wear government told wear sooner. AXE! say start GoFuckOff Page her... isn’t healthy overweight. Walking Dead? Cause pretty much walking dead tracks without masks. non-Americans right even vote American officials, say American politics. Non-Americans hands tied watching American policies wreck havoc internationally.

No country allows non-citizens vote. Also clearly, American policies international effects- hell think Putin put Trump white house? Furthermore, think normal American's control national policy terribly naive. America pretty much anti-mask Jan-May, meanwhile many countries turned masks solace--a means continuing daily lives wearing it. Americans shit masks months, come back say... oops us pro-masks still continue politicize usage mask, wonder one nice?

This one I'll give you- significant number American's wearing masks Jan-May, that's due number reasons. First, Jan-May virus isolated primarily NE coast. I'm sure know anything size US enormous. Second, much known virus begining downplayed greatly Trump administration. Third, masks negative connotations American culture- traditionally sick people wear masks place masks worn preventative measure hospitals mask wearing highly constantly try downplay calling ""some"" voice/actions equal. equal (president); say vastly powerful your

Lol, America men created equal- look literally one first lines Declaration Independence (the document created US). agree words weight, he's well known idiot- earth would anyone actually listen him? Clearly anyone idiot themselves. safely say VAST majority non-Americans give load election process--just comes it

Honestly, American's feel way. Oh, Chargers... one teams playing empty stadium would beneficial. Yeah, nah. US pretty poorly fronts. spend much time writing nonsense Sweden subreddit? clearly Sweden least incompetent Sweden Swedish strategy.

About Johan Carlsson said. answer question immunity refereed study. (The study higher numbers JC.) clear know spread stopped Stockholm. due herd immunity virus seasonal something else. 

You always conspiracy mindset everything fit narrative. banned subreddit! bot paid governments really stupid.

More T-cells. engineering office couple anti-maskers, know least handful global warming types. completely true. It’s kids weak. It’s parents aren’t willing kids endure inconvenience. open?? adds factual value. 

Biased non-science based statements sides (""it flu"" vs. ""if wear mask killer"") avoided; science-based statements prevail otherwise adding fuel fire causing paranoia.

The moral responsible way fight COVID using science-based statements void bias. UK include Channel Islands Isle Man. places get number 100 million. Shut state down.  Keeping open crazy. Feds dish stimulus residents businesses. Honestly, chances anti-maskers become anti-vaxxers. Unfortunately 'triggers immune response' mean nessarly grants immunity.

No chance ""being out"" Sept, *might* know generally works comes testing effectiveness, duration importantly side effects. core done ""at risk"" people get early, passing tests would get distributed widely. Maybe Sept...next year

The modena vaccine mentioned article? tests end Oct ...2022 ""dibs"" vaccine believe I'm sure got first batch from. production volume stands 2 billion doses produced world wide. done ensure supply chains roll simultaneously world wide. biggest player chain India billion doses alone. 

Still, great news might rather normal christmas all. masks compulsory closed spaces US? Like grocery stores, public transport, etc?   Population density national level important people live cities. means lot empty land. People quite good social distancing personal space though. Republicunts. No. Dont put words mouth.

It worth time grammar check everything write.  cousin got one that's ""rim"" nostril.

don't forget.. idiots ""want real good job"" 

but bleed, wrong. Bocked work. Dangit. Goodbye mother grew fucking cattle farm, yet still tried drown us margarine. God 90s fucked people’s diets. listen closely! 300 million what, end year? No, Governors nationwide authority. must misread statement. would need 50 governors page. Gluttony: looks like never skipped meal.

Oh, 7 deadly sins? EITC designed incentivize work, reasonable job, yeah, comically low minimum wage, weird gaps medical coverage (esp states didn’t take Medicare expansion), lack access affordable childcare housing, etc, understand ends better financial decision stay home kids vs sending whole paychecks childcare losing access programs designed help “working poor.” +1 UBI. single valid reason world wear mask pandemic. wondering exact thing! Nothing said incorrect.

I sorry quarantined 3 months, none us islands. generally strong weakest members. 


Do think nation outlier lockdowned hard? nation, USA engaged patchwork response, like Latin America kept blue collar workers fully engaged interacting other, prematurely rushed reopen. Major states like Florida Texas shut less 2 months overall. 

I acknowledge states likely quarantined longer that, tight borders states, weakness anywhere quickly escalate, has. That's fucking stupid.

What part ""miracle"" understand? may seem stupid understand meaning word. I’m thinking point less dependent actual mask issue, people using ideological container pour whatever going head.

Like, live New York City clearly great job getting virus but, like I’ll still hear people say “no one wears masks” “just wait two weeks” it’s fretting based subjective experience.

Like, anti-mask people problematic disturbing, think people overrate percentage population speak like they’re immovable Lovecraftian Cultists, we’ve public perception challenges like past (Anti-Mask clubs Spanish Flu, people refusing wear condoms AIDS) means models deal it. ENTIRE GLOBE uniting Democratic Hoax Get Trump removed office! /s  Rise Even high positivity rates sitting around 25%. insanely high, still means 3/4 tests coming negative. pool 4 tests together conditions, still around 20% chance come negative. would saving 3 tests case, would cost 4 extra tests come positive. math barely works high positivity rate, could still beneficial. anything 20% positivity count, math favors pooling tests. center group protesters guy mask. Go figure. really, something much of, like chlorine dioxide. bait, prefer downvotes /s tag. Shouting jokes megaphone fun. Also, week ago, Trump White House told hospitals stop reporting case numbers/death stats CDC. Instead, they’re supposed report White House, “pass along” CDC. Don’t surprised official numbers start magically dropping. Anti-vaxxers gonna anti-vax. Well, good? else doctors struggling make without second job. needs start top. Trump needs wear mask set example. Whether thinks needs one not. whole world guinea pig. justed tested method sweden, method B rest world, finally method USA control group. one prefer? can't help excited reading stuff like this. realist/borderline pessimist thinks vaccines going cause issues line time needed golden retriever wants go outside hug friends deathly afraid get infected infect family. Everything think now, like returning office, going vacation, going gym movies dinner, think steps take ensure I'm getting sick. nuts. guys finally got indicted hawking deadly 2 younger brothers MDs recommend wearing mask better wearing one. However key thing person wearing mask must realize mask protection limited.

So wearing masks, education limitations right answer.

Masks end seems pushed sub.

Funny thing too, one brother telling doctors hospital quite upset told wear masks public (to set good example). Even doctors feel need wear time, like told to. america UK? mean, hospitalization death statistics track worst cases. He's bullshitting mad virus buying bullshit. Hey whoa, that's *after* election tho. same, I’m excited tbh. us first half... president governors? There's 0% chance happening. said couldn’t? Lol gets dunked twice still swinging 

please shut keep watching American news (from New Zealand) hoping see ""new tone"" leadership actually lead crisis. 

Clear information, experts front, masks on, compassion ...

I think whole world praying America get shit together. I'm terrified y'all. You’re closer LA (or US) successful response. 979, Kentucky getting big boy numbers like it’s neighbors south. something proud up. Stupidity kills. Names ""forgotten workers"" forgets people actually handing life saving drugs vaccines.

Love it. Still need FDA approval. can't unilaterally put drug market want to. middle school already spreading corona 10th grade level Okay, reading thread sources, wow. getting downvoted? realism. get false hopes getting vaccine 2 months. This! son working Frontline getting shit every day customers. Even one come asked items bagged seperatly Covid positive buying stuff Covid negative friend. Like WTF Covid positive person even out? people reason we're never getting without vaccine anecdote great all.

But Bright testified 2 year production time oath Congress meetings CDC May. company's continue say they're working it. Yes. 6-12 months said shut 5-10 million people dead. That's insane. 

And right shutting hurt poor people. have. Nobody forced choose health home/food. that's coronavirus issue can't make one blaming shutdowns. That's government issue, specifically republican Senate. 

There tons countries locked down, government stimulus actually went people instead huge corporations pretty much recovered covid completely. 

None point though. point serious. Even though millions people died. (why criteria serious) hundreds thousands dead people enough you??) know way, tragic, really care poor person mistreated making clothes one far away countries?

Like that, everyone you. Probably similar gym rules. Put common areas approached staff take eating. irresponsible media driven notion bears weight reality. One study shows antibodies MAY fade 2-3 months journalists jump sensationalist headlines. Antibodies line defense pathogens fade naturally EVERY infection could encounter.

Also vaccines potentially provide different stronger immune responses natural infection confer. idea anti science based, fear mongering, advertisement profit driven hokum! 

Journalists scientists. Lol I’m sure Dr.Bright don’t think he’s considering supply demand works. huge demand syringes supply would greatly increased. mention geography factor. one rail line connecting BC rest Canada, 1 Highway. factory Ontario generally ship products South (aka US) East. ship sail around Panama Canal get BC. easier Western Canada source goods Asia US rest Canada. Immunocompromised people can’t get vaccinated though require herd immunity safe. would mental.

In Formula 1 today, team fix suspension within 15 minutes, level impressive steroids, saves thousands lives instead one guy's race.

If pull off, better double people medical field earn. I've pulse oximeter since mid-May. feel like widely discussed back now. Note live northeast. mean, said much - fast tracking best option right hope safe enough long term effects less severe actually getting COVID. sure repeating things I've already said argue me..? 

My point can't blame someone waiting extra couple weeks getting vaccine given extreme likelihood issues arise first weeks new, supermassively distributed vaccine. Look coronavirus testing regime US; first weeks nightmare issues ironed out. Navy supposed do? Thank kind words, internet stranger. Wishing family health safety well. Hopefully things get better soon. Congratulations cuba! Nice see good news time time. Study: People spread viruses. would've guessed? another Tennesseean got shithole summer doesn’t surprise me. People ignorant looking good conspiracy. Stay safe friend, don’t let godawful state drag down. guess anything’s possible, doesn’t seem likely. First actually takes effort code death COVID pneumonia. anything likely undercount deaths reason. fiancé agreed on, too. Wait first, get it. Valhalla welcome Lord Flames open arms. Sad someone could partisan actually believe gibberish. 

They responsible. them. protestors. mask-less people. refusing socially distance themselves. understand fit sort narrative people want believe. Understand drawing partisan lines virus part problem. r/woooosh would rather dead broke?

Edit: like got downvoted pointing syntax error. Ky highest number new cases reported today. asshole i’m genuinely curious, feel way? like Brazil

Brazil, US South Africa, specifically. pretty shitty sadly effective authority supreme court vacancies last year office filled. SE Asia control. Vietnam new case today, none yesterday, 8 15th example. asked whether USA well February, virus raging Italy, would've said no. People forgotten takes time virus spread. Restrictions without enforcement meaningless. 

We locked virus got here; good fortune. Virus never chance spread could even figure happening. But, again, we're going explosion activity couple months. assume things okay far means things continue fine despite dramatic change circumstance height egoism. 

Teachers supposed go back work, bosses staying Zoom. Cases damn near 1000x March, we're pretending like contained. guidelines containing symptomatic carriers, we're pretending like virus spread mainly asymptomatic carriers.

*Everywhere* tried dip foot diseased pool experienced spike, whether relaxing lock-down reopening schools. refuse feed shit we're oh-so-special-and-rational matter.

*We virus contained.* best, we're currently slowing spread. hospital running health check. wouldn’t fly Isn’t Oxford U/AstraZeneca vaccine?
Why news related vaccine omit involvement major pharma company? wouldn’t happen without all.  jury still that, however people never developed immunity that’s herd immunity desirable companies save office Space costs, others would hurt it. 

All restaurants, gas stations, convenience stores, hotels, etc rely people going office meeting person would hurt. scientific reason wouldn’t be? California closed things much earlier New York, California opened early. Let's see happens next weeks NY reopens, let't see eat words covid spike happens Northeast again. everything opens up, spikes. That's happens there's viral pandemic vaccine treatments. quite bit security realize parks

I friend photographer, trying sneak nudie photos GF secluded part one parks years ago. said literally seconds dropping top security showed removed them. said never even saw came from. read somewhere poll taken 1/3 US said would get vaccine. 2/3 population wouldn’t enough herd immunity. 

I’m wearing masks family takes social distancing seriously don’t think would want get new vaccine. I’d wait year two. 

Remember parents would send us sleepovers get chickenpox? Well we’re gonna get shingles. 😂 virus new idea long term effects are, even vaccine. lost mind say tested negative COVID? COVID killing people COVID? i’ve also started hearing INCREASES likelihood infected. wow Thank you, looks interesting! seems likely keeps showing promise they'll probably ramp even right? (if) sure thing obviously it'll full speed ahead Still need FDA approval. can't put shit study nobody died. Disney modify wait times keep people balanced park. 

Plus it’s scientific that’s calculated. someone card, hand get ride. asymptomatic people studied? Cloth masks aren’t high filtration ;( proper social distancing good economy. 2,000 cases day medium sized state. complete disaster. Could’ve avoided people would listen stay fuck home. soon born child catching it. dread seriously takes toll. exactly plan, Russian government thing ages, China. matter things blatent lies, becomes hassle find agree truth people stop trying. Adam Curtis made brilliant documentary ""Hypernormalisation"" thoroughly recommend well basically everything else he's ever made.

Well paint green wake september ends imagine cardiovascular disease too. Hospitals last areas country I'd go anywhere near moment. Yes. tested, might gone anyway feel sick. much cost? never called liar.

Your article says nothing syringes. also says ""about time"" 300m vaccine doses. 

So please provide source full syringes 300m delivered October. wonder 3x purchased AZ stocks average. Oh yeah! want awards. Amlo populist. talks tough, he’s coward.

At one point, Mexican officials talking pulling anti-terrorism support trump kept racist crap. went setting camps side border appease trump.

Amlo spine cartels straight threatened let know they’re charge him.

But thought Anaya would better leader saw. Still, knew Amlo would win Anaya spoke well educated Mexico isn’t that. That’s actually buttholes work, love sentiment. What? long take make syringe? admit 100% ignorant area. surprises me, based kinda imagined idea mass production factories works. wow. Sure, voted like did. Fuck all. worry, stop sinking eventually. Shit man, that's true, that's gotta suck you. Covid symptoms symptoms multiple diseases, know? capacity set really low. 

IIRC Bob C said capacity 30% evaluate well works 

They aren’t hitting 30% parks empty I’m scientist, cousin ICU nurse working COVID-19 patients. said large number recovered patients (particularly elderly patients) previously released testing negative returning positive tests. doesn’t know it’s new infections, infection went away enough test negative came back That's good hear. 

It looks like starting building I'm still clear details. 

Pretty stressful time two kids wife working schools. Dumb question probably, multiple countries able get vaccine becomes available? sure production distribution work. Inb4 antivax people ruin everyone. Chuck Woolery. dig morons from. year clinical testing see actually works note side effects? Surely can’t ready go commercially available two months biggest worry this, think population that’s social distancing wearing masks, heavily overlaps anti-vax population. I’m worried enough people get vaccine us achieve herd immunity, sincerely hope I’m wrong. Yeah. might get alive, also might minus leg. liver. pancreas. half brain. appreciate thought teachers going get shit.

Oh I'm buying scratch offs. I'm buying real thing lol. That's Tuesday night r/technicallythetruth That's I'm thinking can’t ask help? you’re going risk infecting people? wtf wrong you? I’m confused, though would enough doses UK September, they’re saying 1m doses. What’s correct number?!? want optimistic trust college students responsible, mention idiot parents sending K-12 kids school wearing mask. definitely second wave NY, hopefully catch fast enough prevent anything truly terrible (though terrible nonetheless).

Public schools NEED go fully remote school year -- NY teacher certification one difficult ones obtain, let's put noggins good use figure this. argument literally makes sense. biggest inconvenience mask hot itchy. mental health issues suffered pandemic caused lockdown people acting stupid leading cases rising, masks. traditionally Phase 3 basically Phase 1 (safety) 2 (efficacy) combined larger scale, we're rolling phase 2 phase 3 vaccines *main* question efficacy.

Obviously they're still monitoring safety issues develop take seriously main question is, ""Will work?""

The phase 3 trials also happening *much* larger scale would normal drug, chance detecting rare safety issues much higher. Long-term safety issues can't really detected except greater period time calculus government decision-making they're willing take (relatively low) risk longer term issues short-term problems we're dealing now. money make taken need vaccine, cash vaccinated. priorities ones need examined. vaccine must distributed people need free charge, profits damned See: fruits anti-intellectualism. guys mess. Don’t forget professional athletes (you know, people absolute peak physics condition thus, statistically, least likely suffer complications infection)! think quarantined long beginning 

**We never nationwide lockdown**. Funny would view like that. Compared Europe, never fully lockdowned states quarantine likely 2-3 weeks short. 


**Too little late** describes response. began mid-March places like Texas reopened already May 1st. states never even lockdowned. Many 'crazy' states never bothered lockdown. crazy preexisting condition. Many Americans believe political culture directly denies need active, effective public action.



So say went severe somehow led less results, think important compare responsibility determination shown countries. Compared successful nations, neither contact traced lockdowned fully. 


It's fully arguable say Occam's Razor simpler answer: America incapable taking stern nationwide action. triage mode. Yes people getting ""hand outs"" unprecedented crisis, whats alternative... think happens millions millions enough rent/mortgage. reports 28 million americans may lose housing over. working full time getting planes going factories throughout this.

He says figure reasoning one several scenarios FHM looking at, nothing based established.

\- nothing know. possible find either simple way possible T-cell studies large populations.

\- response question press conference, general statement made new assessment, emphasizes. They’re either evil unbelievably stupid da real mvp. how's possible? can't believe bug, maybe misconfiguration server? Assume everyone **infected** have.

¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ Universities already patent research Trump definitely fucking America too. Fauci isn’t angel. article joke. Look advised us take precautions critical early stages virus. worst part Fauci health organizations knowingly lying telling us wear masks masks won’t help - time requiring health care personnel. Shits insane. matter say, contributed large number deaths. it’s important note difference phases response clearly isn’t good faith. 

Yes, phase 1 trials usually invasive “risky.” said, specific trial discussed phase 3, significantly less “adverse effects” risk phase 1. idea you’re talking first phase response signing phase 3 tests.

Edit: curious, person responded intentionally left feel “right.” phase 3, section tests studying... “

Phase 3 trials begin it’s clear vaccine doesn’t cause immediate adverse effects appears provoke immune response. goal see vaccine actually protects subjects getting COVID-19 or, get it, causes illness less severe.” likely trade jobs. way teach Canada instead driving states. Winning Yeah... So... fuck mr dipshit bar owner. couple notes comparing recent Moderna AstraZeneca vaccine studies. www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2022483) www.thelancet.com/lancet/article/s0140-6736(20)31604-4 

both studies looking adverse effects patients, production antibodies spike protein, ability patient serum neutralize virus test tube.

AstraZeneca used patients (1077 vs. 45), controls, neutralization assays Moderna. also included information publication.

Both vaccines produce systemic side effects patients. Moderna's may severe, larger number participants better controls AZ trial make stronger argument safety.

Moderna found two injections required significant viral neutralization. AstraZeneca apparent efficacy one injection, small subset getting two injections, appears better. AZ's neutralization data much convincing complete.

it's field, given choice Moderna AZ vaccine basis two publications, I'd take AZ hands Smart decision. 

Here good ol' Bavaria beer fests cancelled restaurants beer-gardens open (places drink basically without getting really drunk) even date opening bars, clubs pubs.

And AFAIK even nobody really asking it. read antibodies dissapate time, sometimes quickly. 

They may antibodies point test happened. seem mindset take sides every issue. democrats say sky blue, sky red. Democrats taking Covid19 seriously means Republicans oppose. gridlocked country can’t anything anything anymore.

Standard unemployment federal addition would capped around $990 state, presumably already wealthy allowed entire wage subsidized? Yes, wearing seatbelt improperly leads potential deaths well. That's parents for: teach kids proper way save lives save life others. 

School policy clear: kids wear masks improperly sent home, kid want wear mask, allowed enter school online learning them. parents teach wear them. 

My 6 year old nephew ace Fortnite able properly wear mask. done. think fully enforced stay home orders, people even go friend's house draconian. fact ordered masks implemented seems bit frustrating. Especially Bay Area full young, single people whose whole social network friends. There's difference sheltering place husband kids, sheltering place studio apartment yourself.

1. freedoms taken away (to wear masks)
2. like businesses right deny service mask wearers, also right allow service don't.
3. living fear (I also choosing homeschool) impact children.
4. hurting Trump's chances getting re-elected. 
5. form persecution.

Mmm something like this, I'd think want limit amount do... case something undesirable consequences... envy America happened 1918? Sixth* temperatures keep rising nothing done nothing within thousand miles equator habitable. Guess Canada’s gonna get real popular real quick. making perfect sense, think disagree mask thing. Even sub-optimal usage better nothing. live high-mask compliance town, even see enough dick noses go grocery store make afraid, full grown adults. 80% people wearing masks better 0%. 50% compliance still better 0%.

I'm dumbfounded divided country is. time unite help one other. Instead fighting masks whether COVID-19 even real.

This kind misleading sentence. read paper published today, half (543) people given actual vaccine candidate ChAdOx1, half received different vaccine control group. Aye, still pay zero. Hrm, almost seems easier put microchips inside people's phones instead. trying defend US healthcare system there's vaccine American company Moderna practically stage. count cheap accessible.

Imagine China reported 'US companies use black labors meat plants despite hundreds test positive', oh wait

[A Utah meat plant staying open even 287 workers got meant participation trial ended. Coldstone every patient AZ. Entitled American?  “We right eventually”

Out curiosity, hard regain citizenship adopted EU country? wanna come back please.  Yeah immigrating another country easy affordable takes like week, right? 🙃 Defy governor let order removed office. I'd love see TV. ""Mayor removed office state police enforcing mask rules protect constituent's lives."" least quarter people know convinced vaccine device ""control,"" quarter think coronavirus serious flu liberal tool unseat Trump final half might get depending whether news tells without risk lot people take first.

This sounds crazy, based absolute willful ignorance fear getting shot many people know, half think (a.) find way trial relative ease; (b.) skip almost head empty line time comes. government handed masks via local grocery shops free. would prefer use go valuable KN95 masks means go frontline workers can’t stay home office. 


But yes, look soon hear demand supply evened out. Thank info stay safe! Think meant trial. I'm sure they'll get vaccinated real thing works. Yeah we'll probably never know about. well educated medical professional gotta assume given talking points masks told go TV. hard believe would actually think masks help. Even weeks, that's odd thing someone background come hard against. Muzzle Drump! Instead getting endless debate whether overweight people ""healthy"" let's precise. 


Overweight people increased risk coronavirus complications. Pregnant women increased risk. That's scary enough itself. 



Too many people dismissing personal risk view overweight old. supportive people want lose weight that's least one thing control. Can't make younger. I’m nuts?

I’m one thinks get flip flop. lets realistic, post showing bunch dudes ass cracks MTG tournament #1 time while. confident people released many people September? keep eye it, said, it'll probably fine. I’m w that. broke rule. post Dr. Fauci sunglasses, looking badass. made political comment. wasn’t bad, political, so..

I took screenshot, brb... right, better nothing all! Yea, would pretty awful. :-(

 seen headlines bear out. know odd case there, always uncertainty whether original infection still new infection new source. done deep dive though. Fingers crossed. 

It look like vaccine imminent, there's bit positive news! :-) works mean availability perspective? University Oxford behind research going patents corporate partner handles that? One concerns US Operation Warp Speed happens works companies presumably want profit much possible therefore price reach many people. also issue here? strange day worried US stealing vaccine. broken might good one. 

Seems bit U-turn. Keep pressure January next year probably regular people arent high risk, arent high vectors get. 

Healthcare workers, high risk people get soon approved. Level 1 virus vs Level 100 CHEMICAL people getting infected antibody count dropped? Cannot imagine vaccine leading development long term available antibodies virus even apparently. “There soooo much pressure shareholders release vaccine, clue side effects...” I've banned certain sub criticizing American posters pushing HCQ- Vit-D-snakeoil references certain politician, try address criticism not-so-good studies civil manner.

But must say nailed it. “Seems to”

UK, Spain, Italy, Sweden, France still higher deaths per capita.

Besides 12 northeastern states, US pretty well. that's every desperateby latching every glimmer hope. Wouldn’t incentivize staying then? people leaving = jobs available less competition Ducey use incomplete data reopen schools now.

Otherwise vaccine approved. So, we'll see.   Mass talking phased open schools too. think best option especially vaccine available Oct/Nov.

Oh thank god. That's actually far off. companies ramping production supply time approval happens. would allow first round vaccinations immediately approval. Normally, would case, much money behind this, companies manufacturing risk. Yes everyone it. US screwed. I'm aware oxford is. commenting hypothetical.  head explode, might shed enough virus eyes ears infect people, think there'd problems point... chance gets impeached? Nailed head. People going rude awakening think no-maskers want get vaccine. Yeah seems like headline sensationalized generate clicks live Coastal NC. Sounds right. decent number folks mask town hardly island. airborne indoors, faceshield useless without mask. fair, safety trial methodologies/numbers/results going public anyone analyze. something skipped, we'll know. it...when every state denied necks corpses. deniers cry beloved leader, then. 

Sheesh, writing starting sound like biblical prophesy. May Hand God you. educate people virus real, threat health death real, masks social distancing necessary?

The way convince deniers infect them. 🤷‍♀️ used way, Quebec reporting recoveries way (if all) provinces. accurate definition least there's consistency across country now. fox foxnews.  fyi Would people comfortable taking vaccine that’s fast tracked way clinical trials? I’ve taken pretty much every vaccine exists far make uneasy Idk Oxford post ton people really happy good news. think people really looking good news. Well, no, there’s lottery draws tomorrow. Powerball Mega Millions anyway. Sure, look NZ.  Remindme!

China? Aliens? War Russia? They'll find new boogeyman matter what.  Also however many saying might need get second time effective, booster, divide production half. Trump going say gets virus? exactly careful. feel like left retail workers/grocery workers unintentionally, however stores remain high risk environments. hopefully give away free benefit everyone. Im TN well, hit hard virus dumb MuH fReEDoM americans hardly hear anyone talk it, south general falling apart Ok awesome! US included that? Soup lines incoming didn’t see study discussed specific gestation. Low birth weight prematurity surely co-exist? would say studies clearly needed. hope get vaccine end year. would awesome. I'm tired afraid leave house people staring cough mask on. asthma wearing mask makes cough bit. Plus going out...just store... afraid catch it. 

I hope vax widely available December. That'd amazing. I'll okay would take bit longer. long available next year. Thank you! hope people egg allergies able take vaccine. Wife can’t get flu due egg allergy, sake hope get one. It’s also liberal one (e.g. antivax naturalists Western WA) fortunately lot people conceded science common sense came pandemic. story Swiss hotel.

Lol. Thanks irrefutable evidence provided.     Somebody get Ja Epstien phone make sense this.  much brake pumping could 2 months though? corrupt GOP is, I’d like think he’d overruled something like suppressing end catastrophe benefit himself. based shit show 2020, can’t sure this, optimistic. sorry. seems us work public situation. forming picket lines. Enough enough. lose job it. need vaccinate residents skilled nursing facilities group homes too


Those places literally cesspool right parent ever bury child, period..
I can't imagine greater pain. said actually happened January February. time, less hundred cases, America busy laughing China. dont know whole antibody deal yet, particular vaccine also supposedly produces cells stick around defending virus years. biggest one state cannot afford unemployment claims. fired 1,000 employees state unemployment office last week specifically keep office running inefficiently possible this. byproduct state income tax--the state depends tourism budget. also largely state desperate pretend everything okay huge chunk state's GDP comes tourism businesses. Florida needs schools open service industries keep workers (who cannot afford childcare) order serve retired class tourists visiting state. Weimar Germany-era wheelbarrows full cash loaf bread? country wants anyone American shithole. would go? would say Nov - Dec would trial stop early? Surely still need check long term safety immune response changes time. whole point emergency approval? That's fine. Except talking specifically whether October mass distribution realistic. simply not. people compromised immune systems supposed get treatment? You’re ignoring fact high risk infection high risk death. can’t assume none cancer patients would died virus. 

Can imagine headlines then: cancer patient dies coronavirus getting treatment risk death high. People like facts call sensationalizing fear mongering media stories like Good point although changes society hope long-lasting. example, maybe shake hands little less go work we're sick. hospital work finally stopped wearing white coats, time-honored tradition actually super unsanitary. ""Experts change mind"" - United States America, c. 2020 It’s okay. think we’re level 10 right now. They're going sent swing states. dose come note signed Trump. Yea dude. lot people immune effects virus. I’m living proof that. get viruses everyday don’t shit us happens political. dangerous wouldn’t allow us protest. Herd immunity way go. 

Also what’s point vaccine virus constantly mutates? need vaccine every year? never get flu vaccine never get flu. People need eat better exercise. country disgusting way eat fake ingredients food. virus much ado nothing. I’m going live vaccine. 300k people die year obesity. nobody talk that? aren’t doctors national media saying combat virus get take vitamin C. Stop eating processed foods. Lay soda. younger people effected obese- diabetes etc. that’s real conspiracy told hide rather get healthier country. elementary school students make sense hygiene whatsoever Yay candystripers. person value janitors. I'm isolated GF, 4 months already. Relationship is, well, non existent right now. much share person see months.

Quarantine atomic bomb couples. Either live together don't. still posting FB hoax? Cambridge slow  Yeah, novel viruses take *way* work cure movie viruses. think anyone going able provide case fatality rate that's quite specific (based age, sex, height, weight). However, obesity health issue, chances dying age 31 Covid remarkably low. example, 49,607 people died England Wales July 3, 79 people fell 30-34 age category. Here's information get telomere salsa? usually get methylated. didn’t realize America lawless wasteland. Time go Mad Max now. Georgia here. I'm taking upon gov do. go out. wear mask hit grocery store that's it. become strain community another statistic. 

Oh, leave house even check mail, throw hand sanitizer sausage paws going back inside do, go wash hands. removing mask. good manners. living Germany 9 months started come back US. 

Now 110% positive want live Germany rest life. Pretty sure lowest IQ Americans would agree parents die football basketball get back TV. 

lives sports. link testing US (possibly different covid vaccine):  It’s election year trump banking vaccine re-election they’ll everything roll out. Honestly I’d rather vaccine trump presidency vaccine. getting vaccine means four years trump, it. hospitalizations down... Oh We're used new flu vaccines basically dead virus. early days, we'd get sick time vaccine. trade-off supposed get *as* sick would *sans* vaccine.

I would welcome fever manageable headache hospitalization day. article bit misleading.

First, June, April.

Second, ""people connections"", ""elites"". includes researchers themselves, families, friends, etc Yea, whoever get effective mRNA vaccine across finish line, inventor changes allowed happen may qualified Nobel Prize Medicine. Spouse used pop movie theater. got this... might need two per person, also going want mandate anyone entering country vaccinated. Especially from... sigh.. United States... What’s goal tho? exactly point! Grandmas sewing machines time hands would stepped heartbeat anybody asked us to. Plenty us anyway, want mask get etsy. poster, meme, viral video Jerome Adams grandma showing us it? Everybody America could nice cloth mask first week. politicians 

They voted politicians. supported them. majority Americans didn't, gotten elected. governments.

America democracy. People right vote here. majority people like way things care. compare Americans refugees. ignorant offensive people ACTUAL oppressive countries. American different average Canadian

There big difference values Americans Canadians. Take healthcare example. majority Americans think healthcare basic right. healthcare system way is. Canadians do. COVID-19 messes country bad need move here,

No, clean mess. Time tough love. I'm American. support countries boycotting us, allowing us in, America LAST country get type COVID vaccine. time country learn lesson.  they'd include locals going door door.

like local PD.. ""offended"" beat shit people? 19 years one either. Young people sick. sorry. yes know since God ones, majority you... generation known for, congrats agree. didn’t say safe. said cohort P2 study expanded include 55s find published.

I don’t think disagreeing. sharing information. confirm. Mexico people wear masks go absolute batshit asked get temperature checked. say ""kills brain cells"". stand original comment, there's way know antibodies last two years.

People infected twice. I'll keep spiking ball top head long dumb enough let Russia beat still cool.  Hydroxychloroquine 2.0 7k+ PCR tests - number includes anti-body tests too. Stay-at-home orders never meant resource. goal flattened curve, would ramp capacity testing contact tracing, stay ahead virus began reopen. Western nations it. failed, choose continuing stay-at-home's reopening without tools necessary protect I've thinking moving Canada country least past 10 years. last 4 years really made willing motivated it. Yeah, normal circumstances, 100% agree. Kids learn use technology function modern economy. ideal scenario, anyway. 

However... I'm 100% honest ... *signs good* may school year. public school *itself* may shortly chopping block. seems like lot - yeah - also feel like LOT. logic telling true, even emotions go *no noooo!* 

We've loaded public school societal functions ever intended cover. order keep all, may need shed them. want shed part actually feed poor children, allow kids learning disabilities right socialized classroom. computers? nice-to-have. Kids *need* learn reading, writing, 'rithmetic. I'd add ""socialization problem-solving"" that, core, *that* what's important. Computers added back in, boy hope are. triage society right now. focus greatest good - core service - what's *possible* \- could well lose all. poor kids get... nothing. Food thought. Anyone relies money? don’t mind asking plan if/when runs out? Good luck you. Time indeed tell. Fond memories fucking wasted chowing Vegas buffets. get zombies? I'm Rochester, unfortunately much less remote. hopefully remote enough Floridians... agree last part long treatments become available vaccines aren’t retroactive, miss going bars basketball games. hedging bets... die. would dream come true vaccinated holidays SURE sentence correct? kids, large, going sick fully recovered 24 hours? people recording case sniffles positive COVID-19 case? all, that's ""sentence"" replied calling true.

Original:
""Many cases young people would heal day. sniffles put test."" - president United States.

Your initial reply:
I mean tragic statement still true. He's following footsteps idol, Donald Trump, said kids get it, ""it's sniffles..."" also already chosen virtual option. health authorities said masks don’t work “healthy” people. Like NBA. literally can't trust people think people giving award record turnaround time outbreak virus creation vaccine Moderna currently recruiting healthy volunteers work outside home. working recruiting it, least team recruiting Nebraska, upstate New York, Baltimore right now. Depends Euro American style, usually tab hold blade pops clip. One easiest things car along air filter, cabin filter, checking tire pressure. badass U.S.? order online? ordered Walmart last week.

J hook perfectly functional design new Ford giant plastic clip mechanism get there, can’t get stay place long periods time. 3 times many houses sale 3 months ago, people trying get mortgages like crazy now. somehow become partisan issue - hard say sub without post getting removed political, impossible answer question without answer.

On one side have, ""protect people's lives keep fed sheltered safe resume normal activities,"" **therefore** side is, ""we cannot slow alter behavior lose freedoms people steal wealth."" part covid hit us hard? Obesity? testing universal flu vaccine speak.  cute quip, way. 

if colonies ever got actual proportional representation Westminster, parliament may well run New York. 1775 Colonies 2.5 million people. Compared 6-ish UK. Westward expansion would quickly inevitably overtake UK population. Consider population US 1800 already 5 million.

If hand parliament prevented revolution allowing provincial governments levy taxes, allow crown raise money way, devolution would eventually lead de-facto independence similar actually happened Canada.

After tiny island across sea regulate price tea?  Honestly, I'm central europe I've always thought America cool. pandemic went through, honestly bottom place would want visit. Sure place looks beautiful ngl, seeing people act like fucking scary.

People indoctrinated finding fits narrative justifies actions fraction more. fucking sickening, sad, pathetic. Americans reject seriously plan voting anytime soon? going on? 1 4 deaths reported day kid age 5. hey school session ladies gentlemen! think worth doing, however remember normal study design half volunteers would gotten placebo, would deliberately exposed virus without protection whatsoever. challenge trials done viruses really, really sure going fatal.  truth always somewhere middle. Okay come now. US doesnt ""extreme poverty."" Sure, poverty rate worse first-world countires, spend day Nigeria. poverty US extreme. Why? God
I never seen somehow used correctly. Bravo! Could case (if viral remnants causing positive tests) rare occasion people become immune? suppose everyone's immune system works personally know 2 people never become immune chicken pox even though usually case that's (well shingles) Yeah get it. school Tim hortons super popular makes sense.. Can't exactly bring coffee maker school. 9-5 workers.. guess people ""don't time"" put milk sugar travel mug lol. many PCR tests completed? idea? sounds like rhetorical question. That’s pretty neat Literally why

Is bored Trump please. react listen campaign speeches. going boycott trust reporters summarize. starts campaigning, networks cut off. Saying subject worth scientific study way advocating kids go back school. personally oppose it. 

That doesn’t mean it’s worth studying finer details virus transmitted. Scientists asking answering questions like don’t know controversial. I'm remembering fragment advertisement goes ""AstraZeneca may able help"". really hope that's true. Yeah, difficult. feel like want compare symptoms (after talking doctor), head /r/COVID19Positive. They'll help out! money happening, either, although also hedge bets possibility employer forces us back office (which know would preference get away without huge backlash). chance make things better, choose withhold vote? Either selfish trying influence people suppress vote. 

Nothing solved one go. process. choose part process posting here. Well, one way reduce hospitalization count state. Yes.

And bizarre openly discussed.

How removed bureaucrats occur all?

We absolutely live two different Americas. started trialing universal flu vaccine last year. pandemic would caused similar collapse almost quickly, people voluntarily started protecting unnecessary travel excursions. goes BRRRR, vaccine done.

So A-10 equivalent vaccines. Got it.

It goes BRRRRRR, bad guy (vaccine) goes bye bye. hard af immigrate people gonna find out, you’re almost better staying assume non-voting populace mirrors voting populace terms moral (FKA political) makeup. information says different? Stock jumped today. 

I'm going buying stocks. pay King's taxes

We took money saved paying King's taxes built Hollywood. McDonald's. Bourbon.

You're welcome. available general public health workers, vulnerable people, etc?  local law enforcement, I’m sure. They’d know sort GPS trackers on. 

¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ economic system killing people. lack food, food there. People can't afford it.

I know economy finance yadda yadda fact : food everyone, yet let people starve. true ? I’m certain would work would imagine insurance companies would willing foot bill heavily subsidise cost shot would reduce amount payouts make hospitals people admitted Covid.

7.3m Americans covid.

It’s estimated 16% males 12% females hospitalised.

Also estimated 86% Americans insured.

So running figures insurance companies hook 860,000 covid admitted patients hospitals.

A day hospital average costs $3,949.

Average stay hospital covid 8 days.

Average stay costs $31,592 basics potential ventilation costs.

The cost 860k patients total would $27 billion. know don’t pay full cost negotiate costs see would much efficient profitable pay subsidies vaccine customers reduces outgoing cost covid long cost buying administering vaccine isn’t insanely high. Ah yes. “Americans”  Ontario, Canada province 'stage 3' government's reopening plan, means almost businesses allowed open, restrictions capacity such. Still provincial national mask mandate though. Individual cities passing bylaws requiring masks, including city I'm in, thankfully, definitely states lagging masks. thanks Ron vote Trump next election. Sorry troubles. Vaccine won’t covered insurance cost 10 grand lol

Well US anyway Lol. Welcome game friend. long aware worthless are.

I’m sure led express kind anger strangers internet, sincerely hope things start going better wish best. Oxford, Cambridge Hull? Pro-dying painfully  can’t even get close friend group stop going out. hell get school full staff obey? general yes, specific vaccine developed long time ago MERS already lot safety trials Problem we’ve never scale crisis - one industry yes, two three, maybe. together? isn’t enough money get back...  yo, high school dropout here. confirm wear mask everywhere go. eat cuz school wouldn’t feed left 🤷‍♂️  articles January lmao. mean mercury used remedy cure sorts illnesses hundreds years. see stopped using 🤔 cares? one traveling anyway.  would rather kids going stir crazy wracked grief.

this. happen confrontation NYPD regarding NY law.  talking US, globally would need hitting least 30M day get vaccine spring. even talk cost individual person(it free...), actually getting everyone vaccinated.

I think getting pushback lot people feel worth adjusting lifestyle inconvenienced short term order help make last years. 

It feels like people resolved fact nothing worth actions impact. 

If acknowledge there's possibility society whole work together overcome this, means necessary mitigation measures may affect everyone cooperation vital successful outcome, start see proverbial side coin. 

So, worth inconvenienced 6 months year means time things actually closer normal possible without inconveniences? sucked inside too, trust me. right matter opinion.

Looks like we'll go back infecting get herd immunity :( mom RN advises post-surgery patients via phone. work literally talking people phone done anywhere. top that, many nurses work transferred unit due age physical limitation.

After pandemic started (and one coworkers diagnosed positive covid), mom asked management work remotely hospital refused would cost money purchase tech workers. know trouble hospitals value money laptops workers' lives. mention fact say “we protect old unhealthy people!” ignoring fact people work supermarkets, schools etc etc Lol, he's casting doubt without adding shit. increase would come facts showing larger increase testing(which happen). intentionally muddying waters dangerous. hope learn say thank move on.

FLYING SPAGHETTI MONSTER! I’ll think I’ll wait million people take vaccine. Don’t want early adopter here. be, possible (probable?) vaccine approved based preliminary data September can't wait sub becomes ghost town conspiracy theorists people convinced hidden long-term vaccine affects. unsub never look back. Heads up, guy anti-mask selfish fvck regularly post sub nonewnormal. 150,000 American lives far. Yep, way many moving pieces involved Well say dyslexic lives mattress hear there.

I take leave absence work due weakened immune system. masks used either staff customers. biggest change massively improved cleanliness standard surfaces though I’m fully aware least likely way I’d getting covid.

If go place work see around 30-40 people inside small building masks you’d horrified. modena vaccine mentioned article? tests end Oct ...2022

All tests Phase 3, including Oxford's, last long officially. vaccine creators hoping get emergency approval earlier time, like Fall Winter, proof efficacy established sure read giant bullshit post recipe apepars author granny made recipe kids think variant spread Italy rest Europe, that's one D614G mutation seems make transmissible without effect disease severity. current low infection rate puzzle well since know hand washing effective way combat disease also cornerstone Finnish guidelines along social distancing (i think masks recommended visiting relatives nursing homes). say take proper precautions quoted? comprehension strong suit I'm guessing.

I guess either. Atleast dont go around trying twist words likes. Naw that's thing, safe say 'safe'?

Not saying dangerous, saying adding quotation marks makes seem suspicious Congratulations finding something works. don’t know something like would work me. I’ve tried tapering before, willpower shit never stick schedule. I’m afraid would stash bottle liquor somewhere &amp; drink it.

I’m right you, obscene quantities liquor consumed. found starting drinking 9:30am, drunk noon, passed 4 &amp; hungover 9pm knew something needed change. didn’t start once, slowly past months. going ‘new normal’ I’m fan. last thing need New York anyone outside coming anyway. I'm happy closing many borders possible. know, it’s come point major hurricane might best thing happen FL right reduce spread. Tremendously Sad. pre-existing relationships big banks Same, I've seen friends neighbors throwing parties, going out, hanging friends, traveling friends, guess long different house/city/state/country okay🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️.. disturbing see, I've unfollowing ppl I'm wondering better avoid Social media whole. wish would written now. up-vote, kind redditor. Sorry, probably dumb question vaccine cure already infected infected people get vaccine? We've never able successfully develop mRNA vaccine, theory much faster development time, could take technology apply viruses quickly create vaccines eliminate them. really think vaccine come USA elections No, didn’t read whole article. Whitehouse killed oversight process congress said lol I'm trying say masker follows health guidelines absolutely far superior anti-mask plague rats deserve ridiculed. ones causing problems pandemic. yes, correct. course multiple failures, biggest one coming guy hired Jerome Adams. 

All guys also assholes, buck stops Jerome Adams. surgeon general, makes responsible. want responsible people's health, taken job. took it, used awesome power position steer us wrong.

Do know could done, ounce ingenuity public policy skills all? could called army [Rosie make face masks home. shortage masks, could called us make masks, would done it. that's happened. failed miserable let us down. name Karen, right? sure getting downvoted. I'm happy hear good news messed times well. short video Oxford team regarding vaccine's development today's publication: [Oxford's scientists explain Phase I/II results COVID-19 even say anything two people work nose-holers, start pointing gesture fix it. Well, thats straight illegal sad. city this? reported. know comparison stubbed toe it. read whole thread move one talking point next sad effort try stay right. cringing reading it. 😬 Wow gosh golly gee. 

It’s really scary quite people sent home, considering 4 ICUs full today full yesterday.

So you’re saying is… It’s *even worse* sounds?  You’ll report directly Jared MyPillow guy. think there's ever going real shutdown country. Maybe states it'll go back soft shutdown saw many states, nothing level many parts China Europe experienced. We're going accept deaths. Even severely disfigured *Walking Dead* zombie could use [face also actively supporting using masks. Kemp idiot.

I remember Carlin said average person. Georgia's elected officials literally exist capacity many stupid people.

Its job make sure stupid people need refuse. plain simple. excess death tracker that's easy look at? Denmark beat Covid without wearing masks. Im sure how. talk people wear masks though. didnt. California one since June 18th, Texas get July 3rd. 

Also, individual countys municipalities California started issuing mandates even Santa Clara, San Francisco LA.

Edit: grammar Imagine traumatizing students teachers suddenly drop dead mean.. old people fuck other.. covid19 also isnt virus spreads rapidly there. Looking early studies oxford virus, monkeys vaccine still showed coronavirus lungs, covid. could mean vaccinated individuals could still carriers. able tell grandma dying Covid19 hospital one got sick. able warn anyone time stop spread virus course... get ship without OK. think run ship better anyways. give try! location contact.

You contact *people* contact locations.

Contact tracing 101 - ask people *everywhere* remember going *everyone* remember contact with, even try figure places don't. Anything less, whatever contact tracing. American vaccine... Came say this. can’t get subs normal times. We’ve rough winters flu season bad, including last December-February, much 25% school (students teachers) given day. Coronavirus much contagious flu. 

We’re going reopen, question, probably long. I’m sorry man. Hope family pulls sorry shit leadership governor level. Oh sorry know covid around years lmao since Lone Star State things, federal government needs step in. I’m sure reasons don’t differ much everyone else’s. lost pretty huge milestones year due pandemic. also huge education opportunity lined fall don’t I’m back paying thousands Zoom University (can’t take gap year). job don’t. searching job state pretty much shut back (if 916 username area code, we’re region!) business starting get slow again. extra $600 unemployment run I’ll find way pay bills. volunteering gigs cancelled. top that, I’m extremely outgoing person constant social isolation getting interact people person big bother. feels like day thing even try find new things occupy time. get pretty bad anxiety attacks feel like I’m stuck box don’t know I’ll able get out. It’s thought knowing end ever that’s really bothering mainly.

That said, I’m still grateful know others dealing even worse situations mine could worse. problems probably first world they’ve definitely taken toll me. article *perfect* example left-wing media outlet writing bad headline oversimplifies actual meaning statement point nuance, gives right-wing outlets easy target continue mock ""libs"" even more.

If actually read transcript interview linked within CNBC article, clear Fauci referring *specifically* New York's handling Coronavirus testing lab availability something look to, handling coronavirus whole start got make sure dots connected, Congress, — great deal generosity, gave billions dollars try solve problem, gave something like $10 billion CDC give states kinds got make sure gets well spent gets done right way. Again, problem. need admit it. got things clear need turn around, remembering know that, properly, bring cases. done it. done New York. New York got hit worse place world. correctly things talking about.

It appears CNBC headline entirely based around particular know that, properly, bring cases. done it. done New York.

The problem CNBC author, whether accidentally unfortunate oversight intentionally attempt make New York look better really is, clearly misinterpreted ""it"" means phrase ""we done properly New York."" read transcript full, particularly within context excerpt listed above, seemed pretty clear ""*it*"" specifically refers testing, New York's overall response, CNBC headline wants believe.

Sure enough, decided take look around right-wing responses article, and, surprise surprise, exactly expect. one [The Daily one everyone's favorite ""liberal,"" [Tim part reason US situation regarding misinformation. Sure, right-wing outlets fault intentionally disregarding nuance Fauci's actual claims attempt make look foolish, left-wing outlets guilty effectively giving right-wing outlets free fuel bogus headline. Oh, well. economy isn’t open people feel safe enough participate economy. info article one week ago? seems rEAlly fast. Say start rolling September - October, really sufficient time test long term effects? [Wishful Troll networks downvoting around here. enemies. Foreign *and* domestic. People need start treating people abide mask social distancing guidelines like acting. Like domestic terrorists. I'll take people trying get fired trivial shit. Grocery worker checking in, love fearing job families wellbeing Karen's. I’m sure I’ll get downvoted hell back saying this, but... come on. 

This ain’t flu. question that. Complications possible, even relatively healthy - even weren’t case, social responsibly protect at-risk....

... it’s also Black Death. People don’t need afraid go grocery store go essential business. Organ failure, severe complications and/or material brain damage far norm. speak authority that.

Wear mask protect others comply preventative policies. otherwise remember shall pass. last thing need heaps secondary mental illness debilitating anxiety amongst general population. What? No.

Vaccinology big field I’m qualified write it, horse produced vaccines, haven’t since 1940’s. Except maybe vaccinia, that’s special case.

I’m American  Exactly. asked day I’d give permission shoot head got coronavirus cause either way I’m gonna die. like wtf dude? vaccine non-profit far know. made university company.

Honestly, I'm sure really drive up, fly think could track you. either way, person. Bill Gates also threw hundreds millions smaller labs produce underdeveloped countries. think issue laypersons two types healthcare workers: doctors nurses. call categories mention 'nurses.' PLEASE PLEASEEEEE everyone questions masks lockdown anti mask pro trump. 


I one hate trump also question vaccines rushed out. 140,000 American dead haven’t convinced American leadership virus severe. wonder number is?  I've working home 8 years wife chronic illness 5 year old daughter. I've preparing almost decade. Shock: different demographics enter intensive care different demographics different outcomes.

Deep breathe intake

What concerning 1/10 confirmed infections still need go hospital. bet fun around. Thanks that. Seriously Harvey effin Weinstein recovers saint man succumbs....... worrisome. must enact effective public health measures schools. Coordinate nearby hospitals ensure effective public health practices. imperative protect health life teachers persons education system.   One good point make feel like asshole “if don’t agree one us wrong. you’re wrong, lots people die. I’m wrong, people suffer tiny bit uncomfortable breathing. would risk something trivial?” Oh thank God. Finally, little ray hope.

What sources use keeping numbers? anyone else find odd Florida seems worst days sunday? Amen, brother!

A weeks ago opened, watched livestreamers go there. gamble, went different bars restaurants. confused go Vegas those, seemed pretty much anywhere else bigger city. also floored people wearing masks social distancing. People constantly dropping masks talk drink. Insanity. real answer folks! Dont know getting downvoted. countless articles saying flu worse, wear masks, masks make likely get sick, etc. media straight shit whole pandemic really shown rotten core really. There’s selection advantage less deadly. mutation likely good us bad Europe experiencing uptick cases really hard believe people coming back country origin. I'm really sorry see mess country is. sucks leaders value human life.

The governor Florida shit stain.  gates one microchip. words, Hmm can't wait test medicine Well theory would 4th round Phase I, II III would results time get (Around 50,000 people total). 

And approved vaccines work like Hollywood film everyone turns zombies. dangerous side effects would occur early (like allergic reaction) far severe reactions.

For reference, three daughters person running Oxford vaccine first people take vaccine shows confidence have. FYI: times UK tabloid best. Oh yea definitely not, hear successful vaccine that’s “getting ready mass production”, I’m going automatically tack 6 months expect readily available flu shot average American wants one. mean look long took allow testing easily available, still isn’t even within reach good portion country. give away, share research world. love god fucking sell please. Yup, 300 million gearing make Thank I’m glad know I’m Tennessean brain! Stay well safe! low five slow Vitamin D? SARS burnt big incentive pour resources it.

COVID19 hand brought world virtual standstill. vaccine effective way return normal, lot money relying normal big incentive develop vaccine. time election 

A vaccine rushed may maybe given free easily accessible. Depends country in. American, I've seen Trump administration repeatedly push miracle cures label treatments public. I've also seen manipulate data pressure doctors, scientists, health professionals portray _insane_ talking points scientific fact.

I zero faith Trump heavily push premature approval drugs dubious efficacy. I'd hard time trusting anything approved people beneath President Trump US government. put hands ears shout, “**NOT LAW LAW**”, like child. Wait. missing something? death countwas stupid high Cuomo sending patients back home.  Honestly think requires level logic government able handle. White House, Congress thumbs asses too.

They trying help. also probably 1 congressman ever 616,000 citizens. article ad generic masks. Would really like wait election tbh. many idiots gonna act like Trump anything it. US warned November Chinese start report dec/jan ? fact ? 


Hope come across politic, want know it. much discussion topic rather conspiracy Yeah low capacity Disney still insanity compared average theme park. fact make choice wrong. last week *illegal* go bars parties Scotland (and many countries). seems like government nothing protect you! Australia two vaccines already works, human trials started week ago Basically, anyone eligible free flu vaccinations first line - healthcare workers shielded given top priority.

( asthma, eligible free flu vaccination, want push line front someone severe COPD.) sure... asked Russians. least 10k day another 10k today  No, judge going come Times Square arrest you. yes, may eventually end front NY state court judge. we're going mandate masks disease less 1% kill rate. private businesses ban people wear em, that's great

everyone else walking around open sun, hell would making people mask up

don't silly please yeah that's point too. foresee every company manufacture vaccine going used make them.

Similar Ford GM made armaments World war 2 allies. Well put completely agree. narrative would similar antivaxxers Damned do, damned don't. you’re starting sound like Qcumber. USA making masks mandatory  sound like country 50 different countries pointing other! Governors authority state. know page set mask mandates based numbers state.

At minimum, filing lawsuits cities local municipalities block mask mandates. I'm huge ""everything interstate commerce"" attitude, feel like entire economy shut due disease probably counts. doubt too, systematic issue government non zero chance might hold court otherwise theory everyone would right America opening school districts lawsuits. believe so, yes. Don’t forget vaccine makers! example Imperial College London developing mRNA vaccine future pandemic responses - potentially saving millions lives. They’re also planning send vaccine [“all billions people around world” cheap price. Never understood call ""United"" states. think may using Tory math simply counting non-wealthy people. Watching project thoughtless opinion internet somewhat curiosity me. keep asking myself, ""How someone delusional self-absorbed?""

Your blithering commentary nothing short road-side freakshow me. help watch pity you. Source: reality. Manufacturing distribution + necessary tracking = well year. 330 million Americans (+ undocumented). Simply put - ain’t happening September. Well year accomplish this. Jesus christ. Build wall! maybe nice hedge. forgot [another big wearing masks? Take pic article, response argument ""your kids could literally kill wear mask."" I'm Texas. boss previous job went trade show early March, shortly thereafter laid two weeks sort unspecified pneumonia... Kemp exists position governor suppressed voting stole election. No, missed point. Obviously not. I'm saying -as far know- one fined wearing mask, simply due lack ability via manpower enforce law. second part observation.  cures autism! mix solution administering vaccines? stop fighting vaccinating children everyone get along. Offers whole new meaning “Live, Laugh, Love” study Singapore followed 73 patients tests samples every day, despite testing positive longer, longest virus still ""alive"" person infectious **11 days first symptoms.**

Gives heading power Libtards, probably blame libtards. Also unlike countries yet. Yup.

Which think we're profoundly screwed. summit online instead in-person? lady pog face background see picture Karen Kon taking place meeting Kyles Pretty much without vaccine. bring race? seen plenty black people, Asian people, Hispanic people haven’t worn mask. mean, look BLM protests. lot people skin colors aren’t wearing masks. doesn’t fucking matter who’s skin color is. Don’t bring race this.  What? relevant non-sequitur racism?

You also seem edited original post remove claims flu cause pandemic.

I baffled posts. love country man spreading around social media never proven; nice try recently reaffirmed would still veto it.

So, there's POTUS candidate would sign it.

But could one.  hear keyboards thousand angry Karens typing reasons still get vaccinated available local news comment section. don’t understand issue masks, put damned things you’re frivolous things like shopping cat toy. It’s difficult, may catch horrible symptoms someone else may. don’t ego selfish put covering face lessen spread. think that's fair point. trying push ""kids days"" narrative over-corrected. CFR young, healthy people .04%. Average age death 80. 80% deaths Canada 60% US nursing homes. Deaths 9 leading natural causes death declined substantially covid, meaning it’s killed 130k US actual excess death count less half that. Many states single digit deaths per day despite lockdown states currently. rolling 3 day death average declining since mid April.

Need more? work small business months closed, finally reopened don’t need full staff. shut again, suspect close. 

I received unemployment even though filed month ago, thankfully husband still full salary refinanced house. 

I weakened immune system, don’t even know get job would safe right now. tried online jobs, earning $2 captioning five minute video .02 watching Amazon ad isn’t really working out. 

It’s cluster fuck. funny thing is, probably 10k read article. said like 10 people needed 2nd dose produced desired antibodies cells 90 percent needed 1 dose. don’t know exactly means still leaves like 90 people maybe placebo tests something? government people. individuals. can’t punish millions people governors decision things. that’s case, America burn executed trumps decisions. I’m guessing didn’t read edit. Pushing blind hatred doesn’t help. We’re people we’re suffering. see news accurate representation reality. Whether covid related not. lol exactly holy cow overweight woman. still tragedy would call obesity death.

I heard today excess deaths UK aged 50 completely flat. Meaning excess deaths people aged 50 attributable COVID UK. Yes people 50 died it, likely would died something else anyway.

This woman looked incredibly unhealthy. lot unhealthy people guess justifies lockdown measures...  That’s racist addition community college, Tallahassee home two large universities (FSU FAMU). amount young people descending city month schools open in-person learning dangerous associated colleges local residents. crazy. thought showed significant antibodies day 14? Maybe read chart wrong. post history shows cancer. part reducing country pension problem. good Earth westerner dead worth dozens Africans.  Hopefully nothing Trump says matter ever months. Oh god please push listening kids, already listen enough is. child telling hot, please listen them. body listened child ended vomiting mild heat stroke symptoms 9 times 10. Sometimes telling truth. :/ I’m Tucson, closed April/May, almost traffic. Everything like normal now. 95% people wear masks, mandate county-it probably 30% mandate.

I don’t go restaurants can’t comment what’s actually inside, places seem decent amount cars parking lots mealtimes. fast food lines seem longer virus. 

Grocery stores Target pretty much levels virus. stepped foot store, mall parking lots specialty store parking lots seem quite full considering....

Schools starting 3-4 weeks depending district. Ducey ordered school postponed Aug 17, funding depends schools full time campus Aug 17, leaving lot districts fucked. biggest district Tucson starting online Aug 10, campus starting Aug 17. register person online, according recent (virtual) board meeting (last week), it’s 50/50. They’re hoping classrooms 10 kids. Students school also learning virtually, sitting front computer day headphones on, teachers teaching remotely proctors classrooms monitoring students. 

Nowhere near enough done it’s really frustrating. Obviously took time read entire thread offer half assed blanket statement ""so cringy"" forgotten humanity US. dont understand become angry friends/soon former friends rugged individualism forgotten respect neighbors. Fixed  say that, suddenly tennis huge plus admissions, basketball huge minus.

Weird shit like happens time computers start ranking. states idling laws banning idling sleep heat a/c on, cross border either. everyone forget U.S 50 diverse states?

People wear masks state many others.

In fact peak busy hours grocery stores police presence stop people without masks getting in. purely quantitative sense positivity rate relates amount testing done actual prevalence disease itself, making good benchmark real world comparisons testings different areas given different levels disease prevalence.

For COVID specifically tests using much higher false negative false positive rates, especially critical low positivity rate high one indicates large amount false negatives relative amount testing done.

Additionally, testing proactive reactive measure, high positivity rate real world situation getting front infections preventing transmission proactively.

I think best countries far testing ones procedures place proactively test people ability focus tests people potentially exposed. system place expect low positivity rate transmission reduced testing ramped enough ensure fewer positive cases slip thru cracks infect people.  forget, already seen plenty people talking making strides vaccine, great outcome, let's get hopes far. still might prepared tough quite longer. believe us.

But also FUCK YEAH!! states haven’t? leadership common sense important. side effects months road valid concern all?

Of course are. However, Covid immediate concern too, probability contracting fairly high... although depends live, daily routine. 

If hermit New Zealand, I'd wait year long-term effects potential vaccine show up. lived in, say, UK US interacted people daily basis, Covid would higher risk, I'd prefer take chances vaccine.  Remember Bill Gates months ago?

That would mass produce multiple vaccines even known work, better throw away billion $ delayed months response?

Same thing here. price*chance &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; cost going early. AstraZeneca also involved though. researchers reporting results manipulative, whoever writing news articles way optimistic. Getting real easy tell pieces shit are. Yes, hospitalization data AZ definitely improving. God help us things take turn worse again, especially fall state utterly inept basic Pandemic 101. point vaccine fully approved there’s going herculean effort produce many possible, likely involving infrastructure nation, it’s going historic effort. Goebbels knew repeated lie often enough, becomes truth. accurate vaccine candidates mRNA vaccines? anti-maskers ""open bars/churches/gyms/schools"" protestors collective heads far asses notice huge spike daily cases upturn daily deaths? working class individual smart enough realize Fauci wrong. 

Do see problem here? country’s expert can’t use common sense. People follow twitter gave better advice Fauci. Arizona Texas they'd exchanging risk coronavirus risk heat stroke. can't safely hold outdoor classes temperature 100 degrees. Well, go live there, then.  doubt manufacturing process. AZ pump metric shit ton vaccinations ready hit market moment's notice. debate. highly doubting happen end year, every article researchers saying vaccines available **next year** goes well. take issue story twisted way sends message getting vaccinated two months. Hey, make great story though. prefer something along lines Typhoid Karens. Maybe Corona Karens? exact sentiment. ""It makes people feel comfortable want go back work"" say. Tell people like me, furloughed.  order out. Honestly, essentials need outside go work. working, stay inside. 

China ran like that. given pass going stores symptoms fever. might altruistic. moment's notice hit market, meaning distribution. can't distribute vaccine approved, meant moment's notice. crazy stupid moron better rest. We’re #1! U-S-A! U-S-A! Quebec mandatory mask law went saturday. People Vancouver probably afraid idea spread. wrong. FL number 2 nation people 65+ 20.5%. Maine #1 20.6%.

For context, NY #26 16.4% #50 Utah 11.1%. Carl would one wearing underwear face. Yes hospitalization rate may reflect ""new admissions.""

Baby steps we're getting buddy. Don’t sleep back trucks? Gas stations outside. guess bathrooms issue. drive throughs. actually get reference. get eradication unless everyone, including reclusive tribes third world countries (and NK) agree ongoing vaccinations. virus remain circulation within animal population resurface occasionally, much like rabies ebola. least, unlike rabies ebola, virus kill hosts. still likely need ongoing vaccinations keep new cases causing uncontrolled outbreaks.  hate guy's elderly parents. Dude, chill out. guys really forcing this, obvious.  


Besides, would spy Chinese, technologies stolen, let's say, way around. Exactly, gets awful thinking pandemic never end. I've even mocked talking happen pandemic over, become increasingly clear end sight far away. can't stand dude hope God state find enough sense send back corn field came November. 

I'm teacher, moderate risk covid husband high risk. district school board location massive case numbers. leadership district sensible enough they're planning virtual learning. touch governor pulls Iowa mandates person... 🤦🤦🤦 Banana Republic America people switch online protests... go fuck self train immune system

That's...what vaccine Abbott actually mandated mayors could issue mask mandate. actively prevented local governments mandating masks trying stop spread Covid months. last weeks, things got really bad Texas, began promoting masks.

Don’t get twisted. Abbott murdered people try please Trump he’s trying save hide there’s real possibility Biden win TX.

Governor Kemp GA suing Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms (who currently afflicted Covid) mandated masks Atlanta. He’s suing Atlanta rescind mask mandate.  fault. need stop blaming them. China warned us, countries like Italy started get really bad. everyone took seriously started rapidly spread country.

I know Peru take seriously start sheltering place, I'm sad see hit hard covid. Name them! call dumbasses. That’s exactly are. White, hillbilly racist dumb dumbs. reason vaccine promising altered slightly SARS/MERS vaccines. vaccines went trials would know point anyone long term side effect. vaccines new technology, one front runner, already studied years ago heavily politics, I've never Trump.
 
Sorry react. think retracting USA Paris agreement example? understand implication decision?  I’m horrified canadians mishandling things too.

The US worse us doesn’t mean we’re good. Anyone got link sign US side trial?

Edit: would people haven’t read article please quit Brit-splaining Oxford definitely wouldn’t run trial US? article clearly states they’re looking 10,000 UK participants, 30,000 US participants, thousand countries currently hardest-hit. assume joke  America's finest Cool I've heard absolutely certain? Since virus contained can't exactly rely watching see people get second time.

And assume would huge no-no deliberately expose survivors lab samples. get anymore. 
The cases US explode, Europe worrying that. mean. differently mostly MASKS. everywhere, supermarket, restaurants, limiting groups people - closing schools. 


Now (Germany) maybe around 300 new cases day, maybe 1-2 deaths day. 


And happens stubborn people refuse masks. Otherwise? Less. 


I would love get message people US (hello Karens) think takes away freedom wear mask. WHERE. wear fancy colorful one, breathe through, perfectly easy.  


I'm frustrated see daily news. Seeing crowds protesting actually health. parents, elderly.  


Why. Really. WHY. 


Sorry, I'm super frustrated point. seeing Trump, seeing this, would easier THINK. act it. chances ready September? end year? Yeah mate 34 million population Isle Man, Jersey Guernsey. Thanks, too! Barcelona lock-down apparently... wonder long take administer vaccine people?

When got flu shot year local pharmacy like 25-mins paperwork etc. 

We really need speed up. Hoping like national guard whatever staging large areas inoculating thousands per day. 

Because don’t infrastructure place give take years traditional way vaccines now. mean lots people consider news item

You act like republicans democrats read news... Okay. Fall 2020? Like year??? state, population, disease. Looking radically different outcome unwarranted. Lol, and, ""I found CRISPR makes recipe taste heavily peptide chains, whereas CRISPR-CAS2 gets home nucleotide crunchiness remember local backyard gene editing parties youth."" Wow, I've heard micropenises, dick small enough fit virus whole 'nother level. Oh. My. God. can't deal shit anymore Dont forget get t-ravs. know many people protest. Around 30 people.....it still makes news though. 

## Abstract

Abstract COVID-19 pandemic thought began Wuhan, China December 2019. Mobility analysis identified East-Asia Oceania countries highly-exposed COVID-19 spread, consistent earliest spread occurring regions. However, show strong positive correlation case-numbers exposure level could seen early-on expected, later times infection-level found *negatively* correlated exposure-level. Moreover, infection level positively correlated population size, puzzling since reached level necessary population-size affect infection-level herd immunity. issues resolved low-virulence Corona-strain (LVS) began spreading earlier China outside Wuhan, later globally, providing immunity later appearing high-virulence strain (HVS). Following spread Wuhan, cumulative mutations gave rise emergence HVS, known SARS-CoV-2, starting COVID-19 pandemic. model co-infection LVS HVS, show explain evolution COVID-19 pandemic non-trivial dependence exposure level China population-size country. find LVS began spread months onset HVS, spread doubling-time ∼1.59±0.17∼1.59±0.17 times slower HVS. Although slowly spreading, earlier onset allowed LVS spread globally emergence HVS. particular, countries exposed earlier LVS and/or smaller population-size, LVS could achieve herd-immunity earlier, quench later-spread HVS earlier stages. find two-parameter (the spread-rate initial onset time LVS) accurately explain current infection levels (R\^2=0.74=0.74; correlation p-value (p) 5x10\^-13). Furthermore, countries exposed early already achieved herd-immunity. predict countries cumulative infection levels could rise 2-3 times current level local-outbreaks, even absence containment measures. suggest several tests predictions verify double-strain co-infection model discuss implications identifying LVS. probably even anymore time results came back tested positive things equal, winter safer Florida spreading disease. Winter temperate people spend time outside activities like dining. summer, it’s physically dangerous spend long outside people stay inside air conditioning. causes effect people staying inside winter colder climates. It’s also Florida much mild flu seasons northern states. That’s probably virus didn’t spread well April, it’s pretty much paradise here. can’t credit lockdown never really one. can’t credit masks *still* don’t statewide mask ordinance. can’t say secluded still ton travelers. can’t say we’re healthier people ton elderly snowbirds here. real explanation people weren’t crowded inside. 

However, things equal now. virus far widespread contain. best mitigate individual risk much possible try encourage others same. First thing came mind. need moment's notice...they already manufacturing right now. Even train crashes, loved giving feeling hope more. church=holy place, evil virus harming people. /s pretty polite imo State sponsored propagandists, especially Russians, actually smarter using brand new accounts free karma subs. start yesterday, mature accounts. need beg karma, alt accounts multiple IP addresses, team upvote other's posts.

No disagreement critique post's politics, attitude skepticism, underestimate subtlety state sponsored actors. feel like I'm turning crazy person here. crazy alternate reality live put blinders blatantly ignore INTERNATIONALLY recognized scientists say ""you know what, Democrat governot next door wants keep schools closed, good republican must opposite God dammit need get reelected!!"" horse's mouth: Volunteers Brazil begun receiving trial vaccine COVID-19, Latin America’s first phase 3 COVID-19 clinical trial officially began Saturday 20th June enrol 5,000 volunteers across country. Vaccinations take place Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro site Northeast Brazil. probably spreading around actually happening people? Absolutely fantastic effort. appropriate testing, take minimum 2-5 years, happily it. article says best case scenario, available next year. Like said, different definitions major issue. Good luck that. basically party set Florida keys then?

You're brightes one ya. Even disregarding huge amount evidence scientific proof contrary, accesable simple google search, singular argument hold up. Incredible. Missouri care children disclaimer says exposed virus That's literally definition ""soft"".

Easy times make soft men sort saying...

There's nothing wrong it, that's assumed trying say. way things are. EpicenterCot would take sign greener pastures lie elsewhere give bird. Yeah. although put past China perform trials vaccine candidate Uyghurs.  Regardless AstraZeneca US (not mention England good friend America still). Everyone arms trump trying get exclusive vaccine.

That’s elaborate excuse illiterate I’ve ever heard lol Rich people first, poors last. 
As god intended general self-loathing 

Frankly, see much self-loathing outside Reddit. wonderful ""Murica fuck yeah"" exceptionalism still well alive. no. simply mean younger people getting tested parent comment trying claim though. virus also shown lot people’s true colors No, correct. considering vaccines 50%+ ""tomorrow"", here's [Washington noted publication (MSN feed WaPo article, paywall study 1,077 volunteers described promising. report British medical journal Lancet suggested far vaccine appeared safe able conjure promising immune response.  early stage, vaccine proven protect people infection illness.** Students might show, teachers might not. “I can’t wait first get untested vaccine hasn’t even proven work preventing COVID safe.”

Do think part vaccine trial? not, comment absolute bullshit because, per last comment, one getting untested vaccine. Colorado governor spoke days mandate really impractical 'enforce' policy grand scale. 

I believe mandate put place relieve state ambiguity lend support businesses forced deny potential customer entry. Implying Texan, financial dealings Dallas Cowboys would noteworthy pandemic. Calling friend telling provide counterpoint took time reply polite. Again, I'm sorry trouble conversation redirecting, answered initial reply.  Could it’s way harder get test, especially without insurance, high percentage Texans uninsured. least part Texas. get test last week finally able make appointment seen day later, wasn’t bad me, couldn’t afford get uninsured fiancé tested. that, urgent cares around testing charging non refundable appointment booking fees, absolute bullshit. crown jewel millennium academic excellence there

I mean, still got 980 years go, here. Let's get ahead ourselves. Christopher Nolan : 

*cries Michael Caine*   Fuck sentiment entirely, everything avoid dumb shit Florida suggesting im shit shouldnt get it? sign letter sue state get sick? air strike would even effective. believe treatment, research, would cost slightly full treatment current therapeutic cocktails. Important note immunity binary like many people sub seem claim is. 100% infected people develop immunity, immunity 100% protective, percentage population susceptible 100%, either completely immune completely vulnerable point. true every disease.

It's insane many people think vaccines completely effective magic bullet, people equally vulnerable hosts instances infection carry equal risk. reality much complex. Ugh, post close lunch!? I'll sneak window see gene food truck there... one economy parent. 

A million doesn’t matter politician people make more. 

Keep eyes speak &amp; willing fall sword end career dc hill. many think rest. It’s shame. I'm Poe, Poe's Law. calling science deniers think higher education research bullshit go end line. ? news come in? I'm mistaken, women legislators men Rwanda.

That Woman Ohio seems right idea too. Republican Governors contest see one stupidest? contest Republican governor kills people per-capita?

Or both? country’s health care atrocious don’t try downplay it. US it?

We retarded Murica - almighty dollar reigns all. Lady, scarin' us! 'MERICA #1 WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO stream online. SMH dinosaur execs internet, right? yea wrong another commentator said.

Lets say testing 100K people start 25K tests

68% groups going end positive 25% rate re-test 68K people 

so end end 93K tests. Saves tests extreme amount  Inhalers far worse form administering drug. know much drug patient receiving. wife asmatha, sometimes needs use inhaler get proper amount. want treating virus, patient idea getting proper dose. Also additional studies oral IV dosing establish acceptable dosage range. show increased efficacy via inhaler would make sense. know worked drug discovery decade... Abraham Lincoln entered chat... Bleach harmful.

what earth proposition. look trends, fact it’s going good thing. I've told many Vietnamese YouTube, well aware best healthcare system, large outbreak, know system would collapse. Hence, Vietnamese government people took pandemic seriously start. Good public policy social cooperation made material deficits. imagine things true also Cambodia, developing Asian nations much Eastern Europe. rich countries shrugged virus beginning, assuming robust health systems hit hardest.  would never even work America.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* asshats talking white genocide last 12 years commuting themselves. love rhetoric morons. indeed.  US start getting vaccines October full 300 million available early 2021 per AZNs multiple announcements. Early doses likely go individuals public importance (govt officials, go employees etc)), front line, high risk death. completely unfounded speculation best straight fear mongering worst. Brexit affect this? Abosolutely, think it'll make lot harder fantastic european minds come provide expertise whatever fields are. basically implied UK incapable producing great scientific minds ridiculous kids actually turn serious (as have, either initially due delayed inflammatory response) supposed stay home pray best?

And adult teachers, parents, grandparents, bus drivers...? I’m scared Europe too. see Barcelona big uptick stories see one wearing mask going bars like normal tragic shows important parents grandparents plan family event death. envelope list bank accounts, PIN numbers passwords make world difference keep family going hospitalization death. 

The parents wanted protect children real world that’s admirable. kids completely lost. think health officials encouraging work home more. 

There less ""encouragement"" ""legislation"". think happen state simply ""encouraged"" restaurants close indoor dining? clear followup weak claim didn’t want check-in going ER. Times would something quote that’s necessity. won’t another shutdown awhile, even would unenforceable due sheer amount people going outside. sound comes holes, probably still lie. call fuck nuts It’s news quite works unfortunately. Vaccines don’t really give immunity, mean need (way) exposure become infected. People detained home refusing sign paper ""YAY!!!""

People arrested looting rioting ""BOO!!!!"" 

Reddit nutshell every law wrote implicitly said anything could benefit elected official, put elected official back line constituents went first, would see whole new system.

Imagine Trump told law would absolute last person US, illegals included receive vaccine fast shit would happen? goal year low-effort veggies store well. I’ve meaning start “permaculture food forest” possible. really like idea perennial food crops. Baby steps though. I’m I’m slowly clearing south facing slope full invasive honeysuckle - plant grapes, berry bushes, strawberries, maybe couple small fruit trees. wild paw paws already, raspberries, apple tree needs serious TLC. Best luck dream well ! would imagine us think measures mention daycare adequate. also think people less include daycare centers say ""schools"". *34 million legal residents, tax purposes.  rich people. They'll get too. Time start spending spare change silver bullion, ammunition, seeds. live place, live place people huge fans wearing masks...

I would bet decent amount money establishment taken things far, slim chance people work feel differently. fact, would surprised action coming employees suggesting bull shit forced ""un-American""... haha. employer likely standing behind employers this.

I might even guess sign MANY people, even majority, local area feel oppressed ""socialist orders"" mask-up, would back restaurant stance, eat specifically order wear mask.

Let guess, rich get richer. doesn’t, believe science. don’t ignore fact humans unpredictable, point earlier. Cobra costs mortgage. I've read somewhere antibodies last 3 months. apply vaccines, too? Still start getting portion population protected especially high vector people like healthcare essential workers. severely limit rate transmission. shame can't convince people vote people value science expertise, instead based social wedge issues social media drama. perhaps we'd politicians acting based information, rather ideology. 

Or know, vote reality TV ""stars"" funsies. one said long ago ""What lose?"" I've definitely heard lot people complain cold 80F outside LA.

It's purely fashion thing.

I know people heat turned night can't sleep cooler 80 house.  Vegas stepped game. Like, never opened casinos. friends still working risk daily. Fucking stupid, imo. article Indian newspaper yesterday mentioned September explicitly. seen mainstream media reporting it. 
The BBC article clearly says next year: possible coronavirus vaccine proven effective end year, however, widely available. However, widespread vaccination likely be, earliest, next year even everything goes plan. Unfortunately won't.

COVID transmission heavily weighted towards population density.

What's terrible yahoos see low deaths posititivitt say ""see! told so! nothing hoax!"" probability success associated vaccine? see lot articles talking great things far always disclaimer there's certainty. me, translates 60-70% likelihood success.  I'm sure available soon nominal fee™ heard testicular lesions. Could provide link explain bit detail please. read title 4 times Couldn’t test shit like countries do? blame game would make sense back March April. It’s July now. cannot blame China forever. arguing semantics viewed completely impractical avoid long-term, herd immunity goal suppressing disease makes sense me.

""Impractical-to-avoid end result"" exactly flattering either, since almost certainly wrong. [Walter besides.~ entire world scientific community scrutinizing every micro-step process. That's guarantee, best possible oversight imaginable. Faith-based science. believe make God take virus away. I’d placebo  forgot Russia aswell. hell wrong Scandinavia?

Some reasoning Sweden's perspective masks [a press conference May (__emphasis__ ""Face masks public spaces provide greater protection population,"" Johan Carlson Swedish Public Health Agency Folkhälsomyndigheten said press conference May health authorities argue keeping distance, washing hands, touching face, staying home experience symptoms still best ways halt spread coronavirus. **There concern wearing face masks would make people follow guidelines less minister Stefan Löfven told reporters press conference: ""There risk false sense security, believe can't infected wear face addition, Public Health Agency states website **wearing mask could increase chances touching face**, itchiness adjust cloth. Every time hands touch eyes, nose mouth, risk infected coronavirus virus gather mask take off, virus transferred hands thereby spread further,"" state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell told SVT.

I think kind advice would work countries others.
I think Swedish approach would work country like US people often go work sick simply can't afford (or allowed to) stay home work multiple days time.  distributes pharma products vaccines America? Oxford? conglomerate companies manufacturer plants, prices lobby legislation ethic protection/disclosure? Lobbied people voted last decade. cannot connect dots either bought identifying politically young inexperienced. Yeah, history books worldwide Texas. 

/shitamericanssay effective vaccine available get it. good ""possibly maybe we're almost there"" me? previous attempts ban emotional support animals, I'd say Delta probably based US airline. Getting efficient testing implementing lockdowns like getting lambo knowing drive it.  biggest question mark terms economy. Cases rise 4 months included national shutdown president least acknowledging virus existed (even though briefings useless). We've making payroll unaffected many cases making before. lose benefit addition many programs coming end loan, rent, eviction forgiveness. going get interesting. AZN announced several times aren’t selling profit Actually. it’s funny cuz know else health issue that’s happening world? God I’m tired idiots. linked copy paste article -- real dude???

Link news source, version it. Wow. sad. hope works. would love country nationalized healthcare system gets done us Americans. ask innovation happening. one track September Oxford? doubt they'll rushing help America first, even works. Even compare population density city level, significantly lower: Oslo 1400 person/sqr km, Reykjavik 1300 person/sqr km, Helsinki 1400 person/sqr km Warsaw 3300, Berlin 3900, Barcelona 16000... like trumpster wouldn't. Also, lol ""lesbian honest"" insanely difficult enforce this, especially outside. see sorts businesses enforcing well like making money. places need crack on, tbh. It’s good know like Americans, Canada also morons. 😷 smart everything. smart ridiculously good-looking however.  Deaths per day 7 day average 30 50 3 straight months (April 7th - July 8th). last 11 days 7 day average gone 48 July 8th 106 July 19th. 💯

Science fear. look know! 🤣 Missouri Sometimes get thrown lions, sometimes throw Severe asthma bills would statistical answer. especially surprising see Vancouver, Canada's left-leaning city. intend pumping vaccinated people full intense doses virus, like monkeys Also presumably might control group gets nothing. mean something like sounds like major issue me, maybe differnt definitions major issues. Chad vs Karen clear covid affected personally lacks empathy see terrible frightening others. truck driver suck long haul trips, long hauls venturing US pandemic traumatic.

You can't really get without risking infection likely pee bottle unless #2, hope required interact much upon delivery, pray break down, somehow find food, etc.

Just nightmare, know truckers tell shitty aspects it. called context.

You know smith Jada Pinkett are? Well dont Jada used cool word ""entanglement"" describe cheating husband idk like 20 years. 

Now using word context explain manipulating words suite insult me. like schooled. Probably beginnings issues.

I like learn. horrible teacher willing manipulate truth make seem like right one. wanted could turn back ask said exact words...but want look like moron

Don't worry looking it. really smart understand never deleted comment QUOTED QUOTE PULLED ARTICLE attempted manipulate caught. 

Bruh wrong great. Double I'll buy it! “Pro life “ Thankfully, USA already stock Oxford vaccine reserved.

EDIT: removed word prevent redundancy Watch trump take credit accomplishment others. read artikle people wearing masks brain others dnt mud inside. plenty people believe every conspiracy theory except one manipulated basic science. easily debunked. needles used vaccines tiny, came needle closer size one used microchip pets means concerned. also **one the** biggest medical accomplishment asymptomatic spreader could directly result hospitalization death another person? propagate virus can't get back sense normalcy. realize live society? we’ve following rules, too. turd family put test. send grand kids covid infected school see well recover, I'm sure they'll get home. Florida's numbers? much hoax deliberate reporting.  HAHAHAHAHAHA. thing we're best prisoners per capita, military spending, adults believe angels.  can’t fist fights online. countries around world celebrate Christmas loosening restrictions, US huddled inside; scared, angry, saying things like “How get bad?”

I know handled virus well could done much better... crazy CNN-level fear mongering here. darker days ahead, god damn, reading stuff like drives people away message trying get across. believe already started production. governments throw money things parallel would never normally. know works safe? Producing antibody response doesn’t mean protects COVid masks important city finally made mandatory today, people still saying take business elsewhere. Sounds good me. MEAN ""YOU PEOPLE?"" Netherlands similar approach, masks mandated keep distance gatherings 3 people, shops never close long could guarantee 1,5m distance. Masks never mandatory considered worse option keeping distance government. 

We densely populated country measures worked without masks lot stuff back normal number cases low.

But people work home you’re sick stay home without fear losing income managers pushing come. exact opposite all, literally accepted norm since 19th century nurses started wearing facemasks. 

I posted evidence, called data.

It's post counter data. think understand works. N95 filters block 1micron particles, covid .5. they're 100% effective. know measure that, right? measure alternative masks' effectiveness well, right?

I really think functional knowledge pathogens spread infected host unexposed person, exactly virus infects person threshold necessary. also think functional knowledge filters, filter pathogens. 

Provide links data, piss - uninformed opinion belongs facebook. data yet whether effective not, wait Phase III interim results.  far vaccine shows acceptable side effects appears immunogenic.  They're also going get flu, strep throat, rotavirus, every disease crops fall. spread adults. also get Covid time recovering, things going get bad. bad. Well least it’s Americans Aaaah Penguin? perfect ELI5 whew would assume represent small minority Canadians Pretty much politician would spin way, lesbian honest. Nah, can’t third world County worse them. fourth world country.  really, that's generic immune response lots live vaccines. Man's Sky: Vaccine Eh, sort of. Technically, damn near Texas counties, applies counties 20 cases. **SEVERAL** exceptions. Abbott best anger voting base. [You find hundreds, thousands, people given weekend floating river without fixed link March Cory Trevor's. 

Fuckin idiots. 

Smokes, let's go. TY! Colorado masks mandatory, still see lots people without them. daily mail article says they're finding like 56 days ""strong immune response."" celebrating, horrible. Hmmph, well good them.... Tell us also getting rid slavery illegal., fighting slave masters illegal. 

It illegal free slaves. Also confuse moral legal. case getting rid slavery legal moral. Says person lives country founded violent insurrection. 

Neither me, ancestors country happened. Even were, sins father horrible practice. Furthermore get choose born. dad immigrated made that. would do, time travel force family flee country wan't violently founded 100s years ago? guy gets it. haven’t...which aren’t mass vaccinating yet...? apply $50M government grant prove whether Goya beans really cure Covid, logic best people agree do? Right (wing) Walker's... emphasize doctor's office make wait long time waiting room, doctors anyway. 

But Starbucks refusing wear mask, empathy goes window. Kushner bribed way daddy's money. Free babysitter

I think might marginalizing this. vast majority poor middle class struggle make ends meet, parents job.



It's ""free babysitting"" public school, lets families make sure ends meet.




We're lucky, job covers bases some. wife think handle stay home mom also teaches kids puts uncomfortable place one month 1077 people received vaccine develop full blown aids. might allowed order multiples 10 million size batches.

They want buy exact number population population counts often inexact, add population growth might occurred ordered vaccine developed, actually administered everyone population could higher, want order 70 million doses find population 72 million time administered. also want find missed illegal immigrants people miscounted. also want enough account errors storage, transport, administering vaccine. Fridges fail, trucks crash, boxes dropped needles miss vein. 😱🤯☠️ I’m East Valley (Gilbert/QC/south Mesa area) things look fairly normal shopping centers local roads, maybe little light times. Mask wearing 80-90% I’ve seen past week, great sign. knucklefucks think achieving discrediting fauci. making look bad somehow negate fact pandemic raging across america? Don’t know pretty much expect developed country. 

In Sweden governmental site weekly updates check proposed figures. instance, still daily reports “death toll” corona virus, checking figures realize death rates normal almost two months. means dying from/with corona last two months would died something else corona wasn’t here. get clicks daily corona reports. people need relax, vaccine right around corner. Chill out. shit. basically everyone else Massachusetts took seriously. still restaurant visited friends family except distant, masked, outdoor visits since March 12. result, quickly contained cases despite heavily populated state. we're stuck petri dish rest America, cases starting increase again. want hug mom dad again. that's Texas experiencing horrible outbreak testing centers machines loaded.

It work areas lower prevalence. I'm sorry work Texas while.


However would pissed Texan Texas low prevalence NY fire!

Why sooner? Maybe could saved Texas enthusiasm testing. definitely mixed feelings receiving Chad injection... live Long Island, born/raised Latham, outside Albany Town Colonie. Cassayuna Lake last week thought myself, wow, would great place live time being. work 100% remote. even cell service north part lake there, Argyle. dad describes as, ""the place time forgot"". People forget big upstate NY is. Many communities removed 'big city' often even remotely 'suburban' life. rural areas there. too, hope Florida stay are. LOL. cheers want know fault. None fault. supposed prepare pandemic, one could known.

&amp;#x200B;

It fault. ....I... just.... wow.... think would strong indicators subject matter. safe conditions.

We'll agree disagree. moment leave house non-zero risk.

Which left house anything necessities since March. lucky enough work home. order groceries. go anywhere absolutely to. fun? No. doable? Absolutely. 

Again, talking necessary trips out. We're talking Disney World. Ah, United States taking [George Costanza minute. continue [glorify past [flout neurotic [we're terribly uncomfortable United States George Costanza? starting make little much sense!!! Sounds great theory. seen single epidemiologist elected official articulate plan vaccine never developed. I'll willing entertain plan dealing long term without vaccine see one available. mean, great achievement, logistics perspective. coronavirus HIV. vaccine per se difficult make, time consuming. everything got condensed rapid what's impressive. get new flu vaccine every 6 months. still HIV vaccine. get families sick... get knucklefucks think they're achieving discrediting fauci. making look bad somehow negate fact pandemic raging across america? going hospitals

So kids need fake ID get emergency room? bother engaging Bootlick480. lol  real question vaccine widespread access be. fact it’s coming university gives hope it’ll made available anyone produce, like polio vaccine, im already jaded don’t really expect it.  They’re coming Illinois Jersey. AstraZeneca securing manufacturing capacity last months 2 billion doses. They're already manufacturing ahead trial results. 
 ""So far we're still track... starting manufacture vaccine right now, ready used time results,"" AstraZeneca chief executive Pascal Soriot told BBC radio. 
  
 
I think Americans see September 2020 saying arrive till September 2021 seem fit what's reported. essentially mean anytime future theres crazy virus like Sars, mers covid, get skip straight phase 3 trials? make sure it’s affordable. Don’t worry, still multi millionaire/billionaire vaccine even without charging thousands dollars per dose. don’t know propaganda, it’s extremely one sided. Toward negativity. comments usually infantile, emotional, little scientific understanding virus (e.g. ignorance). actually anything *but*, know followed regional vs national government shenanigans Lombardy elsewhere, live there. Masks mandated way late, hard lockdown Bergamo area absolutely necessary (and still paid urrent cases *still* Bergamo) enacted, Lombardy's government blaming national government it, vice versa... Lots things like this.

Also, although keep getting either ignored downvoted saying this, total +3 deaths *across whole country*, abnormally low, +0 Lombardy seen context; but, say ""abnormally low""? Well, yes, lower ever, already said see [the *always* weekly pattern, particular, followed day-to-day like have, know Sundays almost always day week cases deaths lowest. Maybe people saying get downvoted seem intuitive, really, probably trivial issues accounting related fact certain offices closed Sundays!

Anyway, [today +13 deaths [**+8 hope makes clear yesterday's number (or lack thereof) outlier...!

I hope mean deaths overall dwindling down, many (and much highly upvoted) comments praising Italy calling great news etc little premature, really. seems like people cherry-pick want hear. airline industry still got 25bill bail still lay 50k people together. Mhm Wish GA county would follow suit!! He's listing facts, little boy either trolling using parents account make silly comments. 

Maybe America best largest number silly little boys like yourself? apparently ""realist"" means going expert opinion, TIL heard icu surge capacity? locked first place right?

Also 10-15% icu patients c19 patients.  Florida fine. news stations scrambling find hospitals full c19 patients yet haven’t able to, tragic. 

Should check back 2 weeks? wild shit get people take proper steps like distancing masks?

I'm small city 30 mins South Tampa masking places weeks pretty well social distancing. seems exception around Florida right now. 

Florida man. Safety phase 1 - side effects known it’s safe well beyond trials. Stage 3 long term efficacy I'm New York, around March coroner funeral home refused issue death certificate (they changed funeral home too). mess try get death certificate. coroner refused accept paper one said use electronic. Took 1-2 weeks get account activated electronic. caveat electronic can't ever paper again. 

Someone shirking duties passing buck.  government wanted 100,000 tests day, started double counting tests (one cheek = two tests) achieve it! Nah Floridia snow birds live New York already there. went May. *think* choice.  Easy say.

I rent locked paying $2,000/month rent San Jose, CA top food, car payments, student loans, etc.

Not everyone lives bumfuckistan. British Best!🇬🇧 November third. I'll continue post every day failures. Certainly distressing, number people extremely specific type trauma low compared number people suddenly claiming it. Guarantee people worn types face coverings (eg scarves) without incidence. friend like this. 

The thing often not, claiming exemption also conservative minimizing COVID-19’s impact general. otherwise motivated wear mask, could gradually become comfortable wearing one wearing minutes time safe environment (eg home.) They’re interested excuse wear one, though, don’t typically even use alternatives like face shields. 

Exemptions exist anyone age 2 - period. Everyone else must utilize curbside pickup delivery. damn frustrating. understand people can't wrap heads around M4A.

Lets say insurance really cheap $250/mo, family plan. covers basics. Thats $3000/yr, $30,000 decade. Imagine never really needing insurance decade, checkups, find need 10 years in. spent $30,000 insurance *still* deny claim pay nothing. theres nothing it. essentially donated $30,000 private company.

Meanwhile, make $30,000/yr, M4A, pay $0/mo. making 6 figures, also paying much thousand per year, depending percentage income level, like paying Medicare already exists. pays pretty much every single ailment would ever have. easy focus America giant Frankenstein monster lumbering around china shop, there's certain percentage self-destructive idiots everywhere, Time delete Facebook get back writing letters. Yah fucking country would able politicize fucking masks holy moly. said comment bull shit. said don’t even know safe effective yet. confirmed said said don’t know talking about. hope clears things Spain much same, central government took charge locked shit down, hard. Mandatory masks etc. Seems worked. anyone else noticed two tags first screen sub ""USA"" ""Good news"".

Damn, stuff's going great there. works someone keeping honest. 

The part, really part recovery plan change, that, I'm sorry say plan help you. 

Add couple hours story mine, though. I've never great vision willpower either, I'm it. Initially feel much different before. leap. still drunk every day, buzzed every day, buzzed part day, warm feeling part day. Soon enough I'll functionally sober 24/7. 

My plan might work you. There's chance might quit entirely. Whatever do, try late lol, believable, even notice. That’s understatement! gov. would question accuracy story.. Parsons.. surprise all, seems everything make sure MO major hotspot. feel like missing already manufacturing vaccine *assuming* passes phase 3 trials. soon gets star approval, already millions vaccines manufactured. right matter opinion.

Facts don’t care feelings bro. don’t like shown you’re wrong, maybe internet isn’t right medium you. lysol liquid way extract lysol wipes injection? 

/s Yes, clear idea comparison I'm making. Excluding many years life expectancy suppose coronavirus infection steals infected? Obviously excluding 2 3% cases appears chronic, people testing positive symptoms 3 months - absent effective treatment brings infection's progression halt like treatment gave HIV, since they'll probably dead within year two max.

8 9 figures worth people probably going die prematurely this, suffering collapse quality life first, failed contain virus. top that, United States probably going collapse disintegrate faster Soviet Union following Chernobyl, thanks idiot-in-chief lack leadership. 

The deaths caused virus Ukraine Belarus, amount death suffering catastrophe cause likely greater equal. consolation prize render significant area uninhabitable.  refuse serve people wash hands! Guests must lick doorknob enter!! pre-existing conditions??? /s say handling problem like pandemic, correct reaction inevitably look hindsight like overreaction. People say “See? big deal! hell go trouble something insignificant?” Often it’s impossible see consequences path taken, there’s example hold say, “This would become us didn’t did.” Well, thanks US, lots countries right thing example would’ve happened. We’ve proven strategies right. You’re welcome, world!  Probably unchecked authority slaughter minorities ""libtards"". Basically anyone accept fascism. ...for stock market players.  article pointed kids transmit well adults. understand similar flu time explain you.  Well, school district upper Midwest says 10% infection rate needed they'll offer distance learning. We'll never reach that, though, parents screaming everyone get back school parents lie say kids sick and/or fail get tested. Combine Tylenol school boom! virus! Well see said quiet part 

It's weird chlorine dioxide relatively high dosage toxic guess great thing US cut funding they've publishing 34 years chlorine dioxide perfectly safe dosages proposed treat Covid.

As efficacy chlorine dioxide treating covid - clue. struggle something deemed safe 20 years ago toxic. Reminds hydroxychloroquine went billions doses administered without single death dangerous drug. clue effective covid, highly doubt dangerous. Honestly, projects want become household names, need brand better. give project codename people actually pronounce. really realistic expect anyone call something mRNA-1273. boils one person, Trump. actions would different, whole mess could avoided. Selfish morons, really wouldn’t care weren’t getting innocent people sick, tbh government. seems like half people town looking forward participating end civilization. really think EMTs take someone ER? able access emergency care?

It's plausible deniability. 

Like St. Johns county commission refused three times mask ordinance. time saw, refused grounds study more....literally kind fabric would best?

No place mandates type fabric. say face covering.

But, hey, gives plausible deniability. 

And people -- come mind -- hide behind that. way certain party hid behind dog whistles racism claimed plausible deniability. 

While rest us see clearly what's going on. Florida nursing home fuck? Noooo, can't make vaccine novel virus. opinion school debate, that's bizarre statement/rant. We're going ignore impact teachers, parents, adults makes stance less convenient? Medicare appears less costly pay whole working career (30-40 years) without getting benefits (with minor exceptions special cases). moment put everyone Medicare magic disappears cost skyrockets. problem medical costs everyone Medicare. misinformation troll press’ #1 goal drive ratings clicks fear, sensationalism, partisan discourse—the “news” much valuable. It’s decades since it’s resembled anything balanced. Name vaccine negative long term effects add me.... 25% positive, batch 4 tests likely positive require sample individually retested. help positivity rate high? Shame even though overweght, pandemic could've eventually lost it. 19 years old really young.  “Mandatory” yet see anyone enforce live Illinois it’s mandatory well know 1% care plight deaths common working class. nothing gonna change 30% citizens fargone, brainwashed anti-fact anti science. Welcome slow death spiral America, empires collapse point. Thank corporate overlords demise. UBI solid everywhere. solid less expensive areas (small cities, rural). big cities, like changing anything, adding nice carpet cracked floor. wear masks here. makes realize people annoying. don’t leave war, food, shelter, internet, etc. Yet, people whine wearing piece fabric face go grocery shopping... smh That's result cancer called FOX news allow broadcast here. still see people area wearing them. American’ts  Seven day avg deaths double start month. let facts get way. even enough time test efficacy. donnie? Exactly. Letting covid run rampant already killing doctors nurses, going keep schools open teachers start getting sick.  Easy blame asshat responsible large degree is, millions *Americans* voted him. Let’s absolve part this. It’s safe. I’m excited. picture audience gets blood pressure up. That's possible. Well, atleast know need chip I'll continue get flu shot. Hope everything worked out, whatever means situation. Either way, hope happier now. :) fuck afford cobra income? Fuck garbage country! Jared Kushner personally making vaccine full malicious intent /s expecting anything Summer 2021 fact could happening fall insane. Hoping goes well kick shit humanity sooner rather later. instead going hospitals sick, go school sick home sick? would go hospital schools open? schools open, would already home wants? Sweden never ‘herd immunity strategy

Herd immunity strategy, goal. countries herd immunity goal, eventually achieved matter strategy (flattening curve, isolating elderly, holding vaccine), even without strategy virus eventually run potential hosts even nothing. like saying ""winning"" strategy, makes sense.

I suspect people latched onto phrase sounds bad used throw shit. gets sticky

*cries Hope Hicks* Fully crying, waking news better coffee people Wuhan learned agonizing experience; suffered like Asian locales SARS. people Lombardy learned agonizing experience; suffered like Wuhan. people US northeast learned agonizing experience; suffered like Wuhan Lombardy. people southern latitudes US learning agonizing experience; suffered like Wuhan, Lombardy, US northeast.

All abuse vilification aside, experience seems people learn. fortunate many people learn even that. people never learn things anyway. proof claim Apple using Spain mobility plummet 80%-90% lockdown. United States barely broke 50% shelter-in-place orders. literal half-assed effort country did.

It's strange ""we overreacted early,"" narrative taking hold United States. Dr. Birx estimated somewhere 100,000-240,000 deaths measures took August high end 1.5 2.2 million nothing done, estimation largely correct. problem overreaction back March, problem Americans used idea hundreds thousands people dying, continue.  think trucking companies actually agreements many competitors. That’s manage supply/demand balance make sure many loads possible covered. exceed capacity, often give load(s) competitor run ensure gets done. 

Also, lot contracted truckers, get loads larger company (who hired contractor manages supply/demand balance). Contracted drivers hot water say commit covering loads follow through. 

Source: worked trucking department learned frenemy relationships. time, didn’t come contact trucking companies work totally independently outsource sometimes contracts competitors - least agreements place needed later. Moronavirus infects people matter race, nationality, sex political leaning.  I'm already furry, would come play? Sadly, big payout Vladimir family friends looting American taxpayers four years, might now. Kinda hard say, feels pretty normal, I've also going work past 2 months life essentially ""normal"" get moment. Traffic way down, also see huge traffic reduction time anyway school snowbirds flee state. Restaurants definitely full like everything normal, there's plenty people dining restaurants general. Restaurants require masks entry/exit walking around/going bathroom. seems counter-intuitive whatever Ducey gonna close again. 

Basically everything minus gyms, bars, movie theaters operating usual everyone wearing masks (there noticeable uptick mask wearing soon city/county mandates came in). past 3-4 weeks I've seen couple people without masks handfuls people noses sticking out, general vast majority people wearing them. 

It also depends though. experience Kingman gonna different experience Scottsdale experience Tempe. 

I would say feels much better today 2-3 weeks ago. hospitalization data trending downward finally start see light end tunnel. hoping trend continues wait FDA make sure rich people got first give permission pay it. really report testing turnaround along infection rate data. example, saw one place takes week process death certificate (and deaths already lag 1-2 weeks behind illness onset, illness symptoms lag behind actual infection, etc...) 

Like usefulness infection rates varies drastically depending whether tests coming back 1-3 days week. Cheers, signed up! Make sure get adjustable one. also guy Autozone look car, get right one, install somewhere see total tests AZ weeks? testing went course cases will. would bright news. immune systems matter I'm repost terminator took break moderating last week. Tbh, nice know noticed.

There reason researchers saying vaccine available next year everything goes well, despite contradicting vaccines manufactured ready September. cautious cover asses building hype possible release. literally matter physical doses experimental vaccine exists large quantites somewhere. Que? Exactly. It’s working planned ruling class, need fuck plans already. forgot add USA list developing countries. Im defending views, know kinds racists around Stone Mountain. ""Impractical-to-avoid end result"" exactly flattering either, since almost certainly wrong.

Sure. Swedish experts (as well fellows Scandinavian countries) made judgement suppression impossible. current data points probably wrong.

I can't say matters flattering not, important thing arguing semantics

Sure, principle arguing difference herd immunity goal inevitability semantics. practice experience people draw conclusions actions countries, based that.

Like say death inevitable, think would react differently said goal die. Underrated comment looking voted them. Trump controlled! Weak minded republicans easy control. work carbon sequestration next? Pretty please? theory opening schools. Keeping schools closed means parents continue work remotely (and honestly even hybrid model would probably mean thing). majority employees working remotely much longer, companies may choose go full remote permanently. Going fully remote would mean would need corporate real estate would put market cancel lease. also means company longer state, could choose ""move"" state lower taxes. turn, state bunch companies moving state collect less corporate taxes glut open corporate real estate. Granted would work companies, may connecting many dots, think opening schools getting parents back physical office. obsessed Sweden? get you’re coming from, argument particular totally tone deaf.

Heck, even 15m people. economy, people country would dead couple years. would literally apocalypse. missing something important here. Let's say batch 4 turns positive, test individually. done 5 tests 4 samples. batch negative, done 1 test 4 samples. means 3 positive batches 1 negative batch, done 16 tests 16 samples gotten benefits. batch positivity rate 75% actually using tests tested samples individually. individual positivity rate 25%, batch positivity rate going roughly 68%, point still getting slight advantage, rises even 30% wasting tests.  remaining 37 million go highest bidder find 63 million!

This going bad Puerto Rico. happened Philadelphia 1980s. would surprised. good federal level comms goalposts, carrots &amp; sticks helpful.

On carrots side, get X cases per day, get (e.g. school, masks, sports).

The vaccine helps reduce transmission, take get things faster.

On sticks side, enrolling school w/o proof vaccination. Govt jobs. etc. Workplaces require it. etc.  someone graduated college 2008. Holy hell hard get high paying job field everyone qualified field unemployed looking job themselves. Best luck someone knows exact situation. thing Fauci taken context. March 8, pretty sure US like less 1000 cases, basically saying go people really need ot cause shortage. Pretty much happened.

Edit - Full Interview

""LaPook, March 8: There’s lot confusion among people, misinformation, surrounding face masks. discuss that?

Fauci: masks important someone who’s infected prevent infecting someone else… Right United States, people walking around masks.

LaPook: You’re sure it? people listening really closely this.

Fauci: …There’s reason walking around mask. you’re middle outbreak, wearing mask might make people feel little bit better might even block droplet, it’s providing perfect protection people think is. And, often, unintended consequences — people keep fiddling mask keep touching face.

LaPook: get schmutz, sort staying inside there?

Fauci: course, course. But, think masks, think health care providers needing people ill. **The people who, look films foreign countries see 85% people wearing masks — that’s fine, that’s fine. I’m it. want it, that’s fine.**

LaPook: lead shortage masks?

Fauci: Exactly, that’s point. could lead shortage masks people really need it.""

Doesn't say he's mask want fine. I’m pretty sure order work, population would need willing take there’s talk possible booster shots well. America probably last list. Even made vaccine, it’d waste use majority population willing take it. 😩 stay inside. Brag country country lower per capita death rate yours. Masks hiding inside worked well huh? fact remove New York USA's total difference even striking. state around 2,500 deaths.....less avg flu season here. Goes sign

Like, he'll say states ban mail-in ballots get first priority vaccine. Or, he'll cherry pick data, tell people vaccine dangerous, ban/restrict saying he's one trying protect us. Hey one less full ICU two weeks ago.. progress? Can't second wave never get first one! I'm trying see say could jibe article...but see how.

You talk ‘sensationalist bullshit’ start ranting stocks US companies vaccine developed university UK. technically right, [Oxford's vaccine one ones Operation Warp too. interesting see juxtaposition media reporting data saying. There's good reason media wants report positive test numbers. scroll headlines sub. almost ALWAYS ""X state positive tests still Z thing that's bad!!!"". talking CFR, IFR, positive test %, average age death, reduction deaths natural causes covid, distinction dying covid dying covid? media refuses report usually as, important, choose report.

The goalposts moved many times I've lost count. First ""stop spread"" ""flatten curve"", quickly turned people advocating indefinite lockdowns. First deaths. declined, became positive cases. started testing anyone everyone giving people positive results even never showed test. 98% tests come back positive area? people receive positive test results via mail/phone test never showed for? positive testing rates/numbers shown false, turned long term lung damage. watch, goalposts move again. dont think anti bodies potent, believe produces stronger longer lasting response. reported today, 685 cases Unless Trump defeated, we'll probably never know real numbers. looks like already fucking national statistics. wanna right now. got friends working medical center right bad staff great really persevering. please stay clear. need people possible. Godspeed. 🙏 know British said want us stealing vaccine, maybe steal vaccine. Ugh fucking funny. Always leaving rat people. Like count too? I'm getting sick WINNING Mr. President!!! Yep.

California one best earliest responses LA suffering. Travel states means strong weakest state. husband tested positive, day myself, sons got tested, youngest son tested positive oldest son tested negative. live together, cook them, social distancing home. It’s crazy works. think ELI5 version traditional vaccine, send immune system spy captured, interrogate spy themselves, figure stop future spies. mRNA, send body captured documents spy tell stop future spies.

It's degree difference, end (roughly) spot, different means getting there. Also, likely fewer side-effects mRNA delivery, also get right, could cause bad outcomes (and we've never really done wide-scale far ask know, theoretical moment). straw man attempt use distraction divert energy actual argument, also much like only-partially-accurate description straw man is.

""I've seen lot black people wearing masks"" counter ""Most people refusing wear masks fall specific subset population, subset probably going listen black man."" I've read incident, order stated ""contact"" officials hospital visit needed. claimed going wait permission seeking treatment therefore signing, seem like document requesting all. bf also wore MAGA hat response video....

It also sounds like planning traveling despite positive test result house arrest happened. Dollars Donuts he's Republican way actively fighting mail ballots makes really really hard believe true. come side Guillain-Barre something similar though? think that’s pressing question point Erasers amazing Maybe missed something, I’m refusing compare us nations. never brought up, I’m concerned mine right now. problem telling state, it’s Pennsylvania. one first get infected probably due fact close New York New Jersey. stabilized, Albeit briefly, numbers start going again. open soon, barely open is. things able gotten overrun people.

If you’re going Hull, keep going Yup, also insulin, polio vaccine many diseases pretty much stopped. huge achievements! really excited news vaccine, also feel little scary phase 3 trials, take many many years, going finished vaccine gets available general population. 
I wonder normally flu vaccines, slightly different every year. assuming safe used technology new vaccine safe even though protects us mutation flu? that's interesting need reading that. funded truama education, research treatment much fund military would become amazing country. think that's gonna happen anytime soon. shooting movie. catching back camera. Somehow lot harder deal couple bombs dropping, higher death toll Pray dead Presidents. 

And one guy kite. Lockers 6 feet apart yet next huddle ~15 pairs players line bash other's brains out.

At least practice holder smacking kicker's ass successful kick continue, provided smack done distance! 😁😉 husband typical southern idiot, want ""sheep"". nauseating see stupid selfish lot people around bible belt actually are. Interesting hypothesis first glance.

Wishful thinking second glance, actually 0 data genomic evidence back wild hypothesis. Covid?

Great hiking, canoeing/kayaking, swimming, etc. Easy. shut schools let privately owned remote-learning scam companies replace them.

/s also reality Anti-Vaxxers allow evolve further.. Sure, course. vaccines rushed necessary animal trials skipped, taking 3x long verify results understand longterm complications variety groups. likely never heard Swine Flu vaccines also rushed longterm side effects neurological issues. question ""does outweigh good done?"" emphatically ""no."" still important understand goes wrong watch properly treat happens. 100 percent pro vaccine humanity needs good vaccine Covid-19, also need good understanding goes wrong it. doubt reasons many good. baby-sitting aspect schools hugely important lot people...so there's push get schools open perspective.

And lets also state babysitting expensive. Prohibitively expensive cases. 'free' cost schools attractive compared alternatives. Already phase 3. development decade combat MERS SARS clear trees place gravel. option would require, like, know...commitment.

/s agree. It’s like betting team win even though hate them. Check Florida corona virus reddit.  Someone backed lag positive tests deaths: 27 days. also worked lag hospitalizations: 11 days. Using 7 14 day average deaths hospitalizations, adjusted lag factor, death curve hospitalization curve matches infection curve. Florida rough time.  guy really screwed whole mask thing. say that, people global news Vancouver video clearly certain race, age group, considering Q anon MCGA merchandise safe say they're ideology. We're already deep phase 3. Maybe bc Florida notoriously low taxes? wondering things common knowledge among scientific community. Sit down, keep quiet, educate opening mouth.

This probably biggest challenge. true vaccine COVID-19. need public trust.

The problem government reversed lot decisions, consistent, times government made blatantly obviously wrong statements regarding COVID-19.

Pushing in-person education without properly funding education, example, going lot harm comes vaccination time. parents know cannot trusted lie get compliance, lose them. *Tiger Wolf rage intensifies* Well good news too!

It’s also possible even uncommon new, serious side effects complications arise expand trial size orders magnitude begin including diverse risk population. deadly adverse effect affects 0.5% population (perhaps among less healthy individuals) could easily missed phase trial 500 healthy patients extrapolated larger population could end something deadly virus itself. clear, there’s indication case it’s unlikely outcome still one needs considered even small amount error experiments like translate millions lost lives (enter six sigma methodology). It’s also worth noting animal trials, monkeys given vaccine still actively reproduced virus nasal cavities challenge trials though manage avoid developing pneumonia. We’ve gotten pretty mixed bag data interesting see phase III trial actually reads well one year follow up. 

I urge everyone remain vigilant protecting reserve passing judgment vaccine trials phase III data published. There’s lot don’t understand immune system virus anyone, doctor not, speaks certainty future wrt disaster summarily ignored. don’t enough information predicting vaccine effective thus, enough information know treatment ready. Never mind question whether enough people would willing receive effective vaccine create herd immunity... long way go. Antibodies detected 91% participants single dose 100% booster. could right maybe even political standpoint. Could literally manpower process 10k day Still many unknowns. long duration neutralizing antibodies? Unlike moderna, vaccine better Ab cell response compared convalescent plasma. terms cell response, peak defined analyze CD-4/CD-8 cytokines? Trial results expected fact AAV vaccine generate Ab response, far conclusive effective safe vaccine. Washington state ""spiking"" too. recent article reported something like 20k new positive cases fact 3 reported deaths day, lowest since start covid, high 140 something mid April (while still lockdown).

So far, experienced outbreaks (thank god). really, really sucks position. way, even open. unfortunately must continue operating keep business alive. received measly CARES loan back April, that's it.

It's unfathomable much country failed every level contain pandemic address underlying economic consequences. many businesses employees faced decision choosing livelihoods health. unconscionable, cold hearted capitalism finest. work hospital data analytics. lost 10s millions dollars. pull groups people together hours day pivot bullshit reporting method White House demanding. here, lock bunker happens either. however take reasonable precautions (wear mask public, visit elderly parents) widely available vaccinated. think pretty reasonable say vaccine available need most, okay let people go ice skating small Christmas parties friends, maybe go back office they'd like to?  I'm shocked great Oxford vaccine results released morning, vaccine schedule Sept release, along perhaps even bigger news, stock markets around world go thru roof. Kinda worries me, cause fund managers know inside stuff. Nothing personnel, ~~kid~~ Consenting legal adult Oh shut fuck up. obviously case. equally impressed ability let go head. I’ve noticed lot threads become completely un relatable situation

Many posts see questions COVID safety vacation precautions , lockdown boredom.

Is community exists essential workers/people working unable work home? 

I would really like chat people position find in

It gets old reading amount free time people have, really would love free time!

Thanks keep sheep trust government media.

What absolute fucking IDIOTS call people sheep actually believing science.

At fucking point dumb brain look SEVENTY scientific papers linked you, none anything politics dumb country, think ""hmmmmmmm liberal media agenda"". 

Newsflash little idiot, whole world outside imaginary one. blame them? DeSantis' actions, rather inactions, going kill many people. responsibility protect state Florida. Lol that's really funny title. vaccine mandatory. Don’t let people ruin everyone else. There's excuse essential workers get kind pandemic pay, lot people able make unemployment time. 

My would literally made working working.

Edit: comment thread ""locked mods""? good news spike Quebec far gone 1% positivity rate 3% positivity rate. 

Which still WHO's benchmark maximum 20% positivity rate. Oh, big eyed, milk hearted lamb. yet, world’s largest pharmaceutical company put several billion dollar bet mRNA: Pfizer’s working four trials right plans start phase 3s least two August out.

We seem gotten past hurdles mRNA, (nature published 2015), counting largest pharma *and* NIAID saying they’re promising really smart Probably interest catching deadly virus might *interest work.* Oh oxford one best chance sure. Moderna one lot people skeptical Bear here, question intended hyperbole asserting eventuality here, genuinely curious: 

At point (perhaps “phase”?) would something like “I Legend” level issue (so speak) found? When/how would something like caught detected?

Note realize above, literal outcome, realistic thing - movie/book science fiction all. attempt point clearly “bad outcome” concept, thus establishing potentially easier-to-grasp basis question, touching concept “so turns out, taking vaccine caused bad-thing-X happen, took us time find that”.

fwiw, vaccines, etc. (realized typed above, might take sneak-attack attempt anti-vacc agenda. Definitely agenda.) got next! haven’t isolating since March pass up! Yeah brain organs? fucking cold! test US. They'd fill cohorts days. say isnt true?

People warning ""triage"" situation since beginning US. never happened. 

New York April worst example Covid US. Nothing currently even approaching situation.

Why tell think untrue said? Mask? may come Chinese slave labor camp.

FIFY. Everything politicized. pandemic huge everybody's attention. retail store havent required masks yet, start tomorrow. interested see happens. least couple employees think thing blown proportion, lot customers come dont care. come wondering half product gone shelves educate virus going around companies hard time shipments, dont care cuss talk like poof printer ink. going assume I'm magic printer fairy, they'll also want tell cant make wear mask. I'm thinking I'm literally going refuse service anyone isnt wearing sort protection. one person usually floor register gonna make really hard anyone refuses cooperate me. neat thing exponential growth grow basically everyone’s it. deadly delay continues, shit it’s good know things “thought about”  told r/coronavirusNSFW ? Urban Texas indeed dense many US metro areas, per number people per unit area land. 

Equally, rural Texas dense many rural US areas, per density dead neurons per unit volume rural Texan brains. ""The mask mandate Boise welcomed all. City Hall staff handed 6,000 free masks Friday, citizens gathered City Hall burning masks chanting “We won’t comply.”"" fair, people literal thousands social contacts travel meet multiple areas.

Very easy become 'super spreaders' starting outbreaks country one afternoon event.

Also important messaging public, every celebrity gets shot publicly encourage normal folks get well.

Personally, would hold back $1000-2000 stimulus check proof vaccination; medical religious exceptions.  would nice birthday present. unconstitutional mandate wearing mask next 2 months, inconvenience me, even though save many lives. 

It constitutional force child, choice, inconvenience saves baby's life.

I need go back read constitution thingys again. timeline phase three trial depends waiting enough participants exposed coronavirus everyday life, reveal whether received vaccine (rather placebo) protected. take months depending infection levels community. 

So, free trips Disney World phase III participants? done end week. enforcing mask laws, still enforcing trespassing laws. think clerk even give reason want person leave. still zero people infected circulating, go back exponential growth? anti maskers probably anti vaccine anyway, good idea I’ve worked hospital ER 14 years RN. educated viewpoint way people need wear masks effective. exhausting. I've self-isolated since mid March. left home except one day trip receive ""elective"" dental surgery desperately needed back May. Groceries delivered, sunning/exercise backyard, *full* hermit mode. even I'm getting fatigued. Watching friends hang together day day. I'm aching go somewhere different spend time friend. numbers now. taken things seriously, we'd stable enough place could cautiously reintroduce low-stakes activities. fatigue pushing rest us brink. Jesus. 

If I'm reading correctly, reason people ""feel"" asymptomatic, virus blocks inhibits pain/sensory neurons/receptors people feel it.

So, even though ""asymptomatic"", could well even aware feeling it. one lives Vermont. least 50%+ higher min wage plus bonuses benefits. Like said, wages even able discussed. Interest work clear problem. I’ll disagree. me, boredom creates depression, zaps creativity - coming someone generally creative. Now, comparing country US really low bar He'll claim credit brainwashed supporters believe it. always good news sunday futures open.  True Patriot. Truly Best. Kemp is. /s  But... 'bout freedom speeeech!?!!? Lol Hey everybody! We're middle pandemic let's defund Center Disease Control, National Institute Health, medical institutions!

BRILLIANT! Whats PEN? thought used Soles someone moving away work next two months, really really hope vaccine comes allows two week mandatory quarantines removed. Hospitals also federally mandated able expand capacity 20% order deal ""surges"".  Self-deprecation all-too-common humans. Stupid bot. fix you.

Again, dehumanization, said. Clearly love turf battles comment sections websites far important human beings end Internet. modern day Twitter Leaders word name-calling, insults, one-upmanship. many revel hatred, calling others ""insane"" drop Stupid 

There's word again, ""smart"" vs. ""stupid"", topic discussed started attacking one comment section user reply reply. information jive flip best testing. Terrific. much testing, anybody else! Anybody. 2,202 sniffles. little cold! Nothing special despite fake news media say. 2,202 cases soon 0. disappear, like miracle. Saw Moderna phase 3 trial. starting one July 27th last heard. Oxford trial might also. Moderna trial lot data 30,000 participants compared 15,000 Oxford. succeed phase 3 things looking up. Probably meant winter Brazil really cold especially close equator. I'm Rio days temperature low 90s. need look ways adapt though. wasn’t new teachers, also students. students better prepared self discipline required self paced learning, learn that’s skill help rest lives. 

We talking reducing deaths here. Guaranteed save lives. I’m sure months school worth casualties. Freezer truck mortuary truck requires resources. literacy requirement research putting masks. Give shit teachers educational staff medical workers send kids back school get economy going again. garage apartment separate bathroom along separate mealtimes?

I friend college student kid. Kid insists meeting/hanging out/partying groups friends living home free. “none us sick.” (big city state 100k confirmed cases). Kid option staying friends met somebody’s couch living tent backyard two weeks quarantine access guest bathroom one else use. Dunno decided, parents gave ultimatum Friday. do. every faith vaccine researchers, always see comments people want 'wait see'. apparently hits close home...but damage done, person live regret probably.....who knows need counseling not.....there whole aspect yet explored sure pandemic gets sorted out. I'm really crossing fingers go well! BESTY DEVOS MAKES MONEY PUBLIC SCHOOLS Greedy mega church pastors gotta greed. Ohian here: people don’t give flying fuck think anti-mask ppl staunch enough views care would likely argue back. people using opportunity kill people people trying save people. smdh “It’s cool almost beat slave death” 

-Jesus’s dad like article mentioning timeline speculation like this. agree sentiment, afraid else might happen date given.  pretty gross.

My local grocery requiring masks cashier thanked yesterday wearing one.

I told ""I always do. dont want responsible getting anyone else sick."" 

It bewilders they're thanking people it... even thought. less 10 minutes, that?

I've wearing mask anywhere besides house since March.. people rural Ohio.. including everyone job. protests large impact, spike NYC Boston? political all. 

You made political. commented protests article kids schools. even talk dog whistles. Ha. Show increase NY massive protests. didn’t happen. That’s fact. far likely Biden dictate lower price cost AZ profits Trump would let price market bear (a lot). 

And think I'm pro-Trump flunky, read comment thread. might hate answer, boredom actually really important. You’ll find ways stimulate yourself, boredom fosters creativity. studies go boredom necessary. don’t worry you’re bored, you’ll find way get it.

That said, recommend choosing artist radio deep dive music. Chances you’ve heard singles radio, hardly anyone goes full catalogue Indiatvnews? Stop devaluing name orange-headed one. Stupid bot. fix you. Lol. No. racist ones. Watched Harry Potter last night. Apt timing hear Dumbledore say, ""The time come must choose easy right."" 

Voldemort Coronavirus - principle applies. Stay safe, friend. parents thought going Florida summer good idea still high school. 0/10 again. Nobody's making people go either. visitors much blame.  I'm sorry loss. I'm sure knew want nothing him. I'm trying hard convince people of. pandemic like huge train crash every day. hospital deal mass casualty incident day two, longer becomes unsustainable fast. effects huge scope patients, well beyond COVID-19. NGL denied first. Every year it’s something. Swine flu, bird flu, west Nile, SARS, MERS. didn’t think COVID would different. 

But soon saw happening Italy went straight acceptance. don’t see anyone could still deny seeing happened country. 

Although hear people rationalize saying “well, Italians dirty” literally heard people say that. lose job get health insurance state exchange assuming state set one up...

Schools opening going answer lot questions have...I’m praying it’s going bad looks like right now. hospital getting hit hard covid right now. know percentage.  lot people getting comfortable getting more. Then, people seek covid testing. testing supplies really used tests. careful use reagents etc tests need done. exactly thing federal government giving funds to. Organizations directly study diseases happen order mitigate spread.

Bright, very. Malheur County, borders Canyon County, Idaho current hotspot. surprise there. He’s making bad judgements YOU. He’s making good judgments himself. That’s intelligence part ignorance part understanding that. trying gop presidential candidate 2024 following trumps playbook effectively. gonna win game :) woman made vaccine would make pretty good hero story. became top field raising triplets Us civil engineers essential! think roads drive came from? Give vaccine first!!! weeks? It’s experimental. idea 5 year 10 year side effects be. Even 30,000 people testing it, data 6 month 1 year side effects. 

As much I’m pro-vax. get flu vax every year. I’m sure one. fatality rate (in layman terms, odds dying infected) currently site literally says may able to estimate the total number cases use calculate IFR – researchers this. But total number cases known, IFR cannot accurately calculated. And, despite media reports imply, CFR – or, probably, even similar – IFR. Next, we’ll discuss why.

Sorry, I'm convinced. Extrapolation sufficient make claim making, especially intuitively obvious statistic.

Using exact methodology last week US calculated literally close 10% death rate. 

That's absolutely shitty. also know virus affects spread *from* unhealthy people. Getting virus overweight immunocompromised individual could likely fatal receiving someone jogs daily, example.

Do spread information like this. source using literally admits data incomplete.

Different populations different rates well, due different factors, factors affect virus still unknown. summing total cases sufficient.

You may well say economics zero sum game. guidelines. evidence guidelines enforced? Trump solve immigration problem. one wants come shithole country. want us coming theirs. Well probably get both, win win yeah... vaccine comes That’s terrible, I’m sorry hear! go another state? Even means need COVID booster shots every year something, that’s certainly better now. Letting virus burn population far devastating effects. people understand this? We're repeating 1918 precisely. going terrible. thought thing good limiting severity, spread virus. vaccinated monkeys still contracted virus produced high viral load. progress pneumonia. I'll agree argument fallacious say merely speaking top head, numbers lie. majority cared take precautions, many states would hurry enforce medical masks would numbers high currently are. Reality matter n95 homemade bandanna get infected work school many little carriers running around confined space probably close population density would find aircraft carrier remember last outbreak carrier got everyone infected. 

I'm frankly surprised teachers' unions flat said going back regular classes. simply way world teacher safe getting infected school vaccine.  know. joking.

Honestly, maybe people think way post/say things veiled intent.(I realiz are) still take things face value give fellow people benefit doubt prove us otherwise. Speak softly carry big stick words. Honestly, knows? never done anything like before. safe assume not-so-good economic things await us.

Audience attention span gnat? badly (580 reported deaths/million, 4th world), credit first hard hit outside China, much known then. Customs keeps boat sells it, boaters go back border bus. Seems logical assume deaths lag behind hospitalizations, also better treating Covid19 patients.

In reality it’s likely little both. There’s viable alternative education that’s available healthcare workers. lot counties states purposefully choosing go alternate education delivery model.

Edit: teachers really don’t much say elected officials make decisions say go school face face.  We're going learned vaccinations, antibodies viruses 2020 last 5 years combined, guaranty it.

Then, several years later, people begin realizing they're infertile severe autoimmune diseases. No, I’m American. I’m Canadian. 
Please don’t get wrong - way suggesting anyone move access better healthcare system. suggesting question system operates know things work countries.

I simply saying disappointed many people accepting things are, grateful benevolent capitalist lets go bankrupt life saving medical care questioning system allows individuals profit “allowing” others live.

I’m sorry systemic collapse Spain allowed vultures come extract profit desperate dying people, things operate. demanding better. thanking people exploit us less. Anyone, point, that's ignorant topic... stupid Oh, absolutely. mean makes people less likely approach lawyer know coming in. seen esitmates FHM anyone else academic professional context either matter! would assume one could calcuate # tests % positive rate, unsure myself. Sweden's true infection burden line country like US, since they're pretty much deviants strategy herd immunity?

Very good question! sure, think would likely similar. like ""Running full tilt, eyes wide open."" entirely. Kids soft. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* disease care sitting. important gather evaluate relevant data everywhere. DfID exist September :/ zombies don’t roam unless night. day, you’re straight legend. Yep... suspect things going start looking LOT better US, least numbers-wise. guess we're good!  saying they're skewing numbers show lower deaths positive infections they're reporting? much think gets suppressed?  Chilean society fucked US. Everything privatized there's poor social safety net. lots wealth &amp; income inequality sclerotic job market that's rife nepotism. tiresome read shit every thread.

You better this.

This comedy meme thread, looking like one best hopes return normal way living millions, maybe billions people.

You better this.

Be better.  would say something causing infrastructure fail 6 months disaster things are. disasters cause infrastructure entire world fail point cause many places shut entirely months end. 

As ICU example poor one, hospitals send patients hospitals they're full. lack ability get hospital happening right now. can't look purely local problem, like are. stated, entire system fails, case entire hospital system county state even country.

And yes, cooties thing causing infrastructure fail, excess deaths would attributable cooties, not. 

When two ""competing"" disasters happen place time, one considered hindrance infrastructure whole one excess deaths get attributed to. Hey   political issue want make mandate.

&amp;#x200B;

If make rules regarding masks state political. came across [this extremely disturbing (TW: graphic descriptions, images) r/coronavirustexas morning detailing horrific inhumane conditions COVID treatment center (Twitter thread Unrolled Twitter 

This horrifying, allegedly occurring nearby facility wants remain “clean” continue performing elective procedures.

TL;DR:

•  ⁠DHR Health McAllen Texas converted hospice facility COVID-19-only hospital accommodate surge patients. facility holds 90 patients.

•  ⁠The facility lacking proper equipment oxygen, enable healthcare workers job.

•  ⁠Patients left grossly unsanitary conditions.

•  ⁠Patients placed cramped rooms, without adequate ventilation air conditioning.

•  ⁠Patients placed beds without monitors wall outlets.

•  ⁠No wall oxygen since July 5. Therapists struggling replace oxygen tanks patients run out. Patient deaths directly linked that.

•  ⁠Ants crawling patients least 2 weeks without remediation.

•  ⁠Corpses left rooms without air conditioning days, next equipment.

•  ⁠Healthcare workers told talk media risk immediate termination.

•  ⁠Healthcare workers overworked provided adequate PPE.

•  ⁠Healthcare workers walked due unacceptable conditions.

•  ⁠Healthcare workers expressed concerns leadership ""demobilized.""

•  ⁠Actual hospital across street kept ""free COVID"" open elective procedures.

OP u/happysnappah summary u/itsnotlupus. 

Please spread information. God knows many facilities same. Users Twitter, please also tweet large news outlets like MSNBC, CNN, FOX, etc. well Texas reps! depends states ever reach max hospital capacity. hospitals call governor state ""we beds cannot treat patients beds staff sick/dead."" governor choice shutdown state. master's dont unless location asked to.

I smart enough know little do, wear situations potentially help (in close contact others).

I drove 1000 miles past days, enjoyed making fun losing wearing placebo masks driving alone car interstate much people enjoy making making fun ""inbred high school drop plague rats"" dont see need wear time.

Edit- lol see post responded removed part saying college degree. looks like whipping masters blue... cool... flat nuts. always dips weekend, crests mid week. understand Georgia politics importance control Atlanta. cost prolonged stay home orders issuing one difficult decision many make be. part reason cant perpetual lockdown need precise response hotspots protect risk groups. 

They good tool use need lockdowns ""get jail free card"", consequence matter dont want admit it.

This ""Florida needs shut down"" ""We locking right northern states despite rising cases"". Amazing common sense solutions ignored. Well placerville becomes hotbed coronavirus may change city exactly problem Ecuador. Add problem Blame. hunger due economic suspension, people blame government instead virus; already protests, come, government already fragile October riots. Let alone thinking could afford one.

Very savvy lawyers going look case that's guaranteed win turn plaintiff can't pay front, they'll take winnings. mean, defense, walked wide circles around people Wally World long COVID. think referring Cuba's responses hurricanes Coronavirus. New Jersey could reopened already. whole country.  It’s amazing you’re still alive heart literally sank.  Watch out, might try split open like coconut. Wrong title, man arrested trespassing refusing direct order get private property. can't get arrested wearing mask. can't even fined. We're going stats dude.... go track record here. already produced multiple countries large numbers, roll soon approval happens Yeah that's figured. rolling lockdown til vaccine. shaking hands.

The neckbeards would love get though shut-ins still leave house want, wish people suffer. It’s already produced. hundreds millions doses ready September. Mitigation [polite term herd extreme failure compared Nordics. better many, developing European nations. hardly sucess early June actually worse terms death rate per capita. however, something particular propaganda poster wants acknowledge.

This targeted harassment. Stop. [ALL okay? Sweden never closed schools children. schools open would spread corona, would done months ago, now. That's problem. biggest issue people easily manipulated, happened Trump said masks suggestion CDC. ridiculous topic become political debate, basic human health concerns handled medical experts; politicians follow. 
Even country, people comply masks inside stores, idiots still go dancing clubs essential places like pharmacies, convenience stores, markets taking precautions people complying those. Good news everybody! virus likely change country went bike camping trip first weekend March. two weeks later bailed ski trip Lake Tahoe friends thought crazy... slopes closed. wife canceled travel plans indefinitely point. 

Fast forward late May Florida ok. cases. booked campground 4 hours away figured could easily isolate camping trip. case growth started end June decided even risk that. 

We’re completely resigned picnics garden foreseeable future. Vacationing over. can’t even express lucky feel beautiful yard. Appreciate sharing that. seems single doctor's statement. know, field vast number varying points view - especially comes COVID. respect doctor's statement, experience see daily basis. think hoping approval September roll October/November. Actually, ""instantaneous"" results technology available makes lot sense. That's thought it: pretty much everything else works like that. sure getting downvoted. everyone quick trust numbers without wanting get bottom actual data manipulation.  Dude need start going better movie theaters. Find high end one, like iPic. want wear mask go store. sooner pandemic stopped, sooner go back wearing masks. Wash hands, stay back 2 meters people, wear mask indoors. difficult. Pretend asbestos black mould everywhere, helps. Yes, lots uninsured people. None. Went gas station yesterday. mask on, one woman mask on....employees noses exposed.

6 others wearing masks. Ok, 2020 going fuck good news? crossed mine back January. Hopefully, release great Oxford vaccine data, 6 months look back July 20th “the beginning end” whole ordeal.  “A wake-up call”?!?

Fuck timeline fukken dumb.   Impossible say odds someone get infected twice really low. Booger campaign likely SEND VICTORIOUS use funeral home get death certificate hospital personally. No. Literally scientists wrong every then, it’s ability admit mistakes change new data make good scientists, Fauci one best world that. Trump stupid. good tiny baby step right direction.

That could made 3 months ago. joke China ""control situation"" like they're controlling Tibet Hong Kong example. know, authoritarian crackdowns citizens. expect corporations go, ""Well, sure showed us, come in!""? 10,000 cases yesterday. great, terrible. Yep. bad article calling dexamethasone breakthrough drug. drugs used routinely way applied disease isn’t really label. It’s sensationalism. smaller cities towns definitely two places serving coffee.

Really? else coffee? dont know believe that.

Unless Canada shortage coffee something. menial task challenged dumbest mean, NZ. They've control virus since basically beginning. might even ""handle"" social distancing point. “who forced go back work economic reasons employers demanded go back work.”

America sad could use challenge trials now. Challenge trials speed process save 100s billions economic cost millions lives. Jim Jeffries good bit gun control countering people say Constitution can’t changed.  5G got poor kids! Well grandpa keeps spreading corona virus election going hard predict believe it’s like 
Phase - it’s safe dosage use -
Phase II - it’s safe pt.2 -
Phase III - long term side effects effectiveness

However phase III supposed 12 months long could much shorter given amount cases world. believe read something looking 40 people getting infected, happens, they’ll look many people placebo many vaccine. would prove effectiveness soon Years time labour poured university, prouder. many people give all, working day night, make deadlines. much talent, much willingness generous it. walk South Parks road night, see lights science buildings, there's always someone working.

It's ChAdOx, people working new drugs treat COVID-19, testing current drugs well. There's also enhancing manufacturing process, produced shared globally, scale. people working immune response therapeutic applications, communicating various governments possible app efficient contact tracing.

Edit: know much made news outside circle, test trace trials Isle Wight, find best way control pandemic starts overtaking hospitals. COVID infections R rate dropped, useful. Results here, anyone who's scared medical articles:  going get downvoted hell whatever, goes. Yes perfect world absolutely think closed, isn’t perfect world. People work Disney difficulty getting crumbs available unemployment system, PUA running out, people still need put food table shelter head, massive companies like Disney restructure debt tune $11 Billion dollars stay afloat, states like FL collect state taxes trying figure keep government afloat. way really things reopen economy since incapable country provide anyone need. looks like Disney saying open make safe possible. 

In perfect world citizens would paid stay home. arent. insane fallout everything happening. People deferring home payments order eat. longer defer payments happen next? tidal wave homelessness, Americans seem loathe anyone maybe luck see goes. continuing work despite high risk trying safely possible. live paycheck paycheck afford go even 1 day without pay. care elderly woman private chef personal assistant. difference Disney considered essential despite us luxury item. matter though people depend jobs Disney provides. one forcing anyone visit Disney. Sp yes think Disney closed, absolutely unless going provide workers companies like (both big small) real assistance time blame single one opening continuing work essential luxury item doesnt mean people go without money. yes continue respect companies trying keep people safe possible time. federal government legal authority mandate enforce mask usage nationwide. States take lead particular issue.

That said, doesn’t stop Trump recommending publicly States issue mask wearing mandates. We're Maryland, neighbor got tested exposure nursing home. 15 days ago, still results. we're supposed one ""good"" states. nobodies outbreak ""just ending""...until whole world control, nobody does. Ah okay makes sense Sweden never ‘herd immunity strategy’. mitigation strategy, countries pandemic.

It also failure many claims. excess mortality counted end pandemic, many european countries states US show worse numbers. 

That however, something particular propaganda poster wants acknowledge. zombies? bio terrorists? First all, care education future adults, current way schools it, education, draining dead, repetitive work.

Schools need learn kids learn stuff differently, regardless covid-19 issue not, schools still issue. correct RNA based virus, fact RNA short half life body. enzymes constantly degrading RNA one reason bodies keep making new RNA need make new protein. simply accumulate body.

Viral RNA expressed cells active viral infection present viral particles. viral particles also hang body long time post-symptoms would neutralizing antibodies would cause viral particles degrade immediately.

So active infection (where new virus made) totally PCR test detects viral RNA. longer viral replication taking place need use antibody test see person antibodies recognize virus protein.

Source: (have PhD Microbiology focus RNA viruses) know need trade flow one another hard time believing truckers can't avoid carrying covid back them.

There's gonna second wave Canada live beside infected country world.

No doot aboot it. It’s really worrying anyone defend system says don’t deserve live don’t cash.

Its weird, since saying assume american, even tho using favorite thing guys use excuse scenarios like ""Have money medcial attention? Get job!"" case ""Dont health care system take care you? Well move another country does! simple!"" No, no, instead accepting someone broken system better say thats bad works head... Dunno fron frankly dont care, even Spain fair share ""other companies jacking prices vultures definitely making things worse"" freacking hospitals colapsed. anyone actually know someone covid...  Given way certain people keep downplaying this, fear save lives. quite certain 6 months people calling fear mongering longer be, finding least people infection chronic thus delayed death sentence. wish different, would literally disregard see hold view.

Feel free revisit then, hesitate admit wrong case. would enormous relief wrong. Imma use one Nah, bro. more.

* Starbucks

* Second Cup

* Coffee Time

* Timothy's

* Van Houte

I could go on... shit, never heard this. mean Trump uses nazi symbols anything grabs He's smart person many senses, he's definitely politically wily would discount malicious intent. outbreaks south tend confirm areas, isnt practical go without it. Heat deadly coronavirus. 

Summer isnt good time mixing spit workplace. autumn, Americans really need ventilate stay home 4 weeks, nationally, otherwise winter pure hell deadly high chance people infected CV seasonal influenza, *at time.* Dont forget add death toll cancer cases go undiagnosed. I'd like think so, ratfuckers Congress trying sure companies can't held accountable exposing employees covid. problem Illinois well. actually think early days lockdown completely counterproductive. closed non essential stores every person crammed Walmart target buy non essential items. crowds absurd surprisingly led huge amount cases. proven time time US many people ARENT sensible Almost safety community outweighs convenience Karen. Same. Except call high school dropout plague rats.

I real education problem calling anti-maskers are. [Yes is! careful applying filters correctly comparing months available provisional deaths. know effective reproduction number Sweden two last weeks? Question, hospitals overflowed like Italy?

I assume Italy old population, much higher % people it, needed hospital care. also assume Italy many hospitals? maybe USA time prepare? say, I'm firmly pro-vaccination get flu shots every year, etc., non-scientist teacher mildly concerned I'll pushed vaccine rushed may end hurting me. I'm glad posted this. resources accessible understandable read on? nCoV-19

This absolute Chad vaccine coming save us all. here. Online us protect children teachers staff.  Woo freakin' hoo !!!

So 2 legit contenders, one &amp; Moderna. Oxford already phase3 Brazil Moderna ramping phase3 next week. 

Finally put shit behind us! Great job folks Oxford - cuz freaking Oxford afterall. blood clotting disorder stranger anticoagulants since I'm life. Due complications taking warfarin, take Lovenox shots instead. Although heparin, wonder shares similar qualities neutralizing COVID. time, worries meds expensive AF shortage happens, completely screwed. Especially you’re Texas Florida 🙄 im saying hard people. Im saying European governments able make systems react way health systems government general produced outcome 30% worse flu. brand new deadly virus, definitely changed people's lives  massive disasters report excess deaths caused infrastructure failure (including hospitals' ability treat patients) part death toll, though usually category. 

I think ""massive disasters"" normally considered things taking place gradually course several months though, no? feels like supposed generally refer natural disasters terrible catastrophes.

Is disease dealing 6 months considered ""infrastructure destroying event"" simply surge week maxes ICU beds? Conservative ideology U.S. tends framed around notion small government = good big government = bad.

This dated back founding nation idea strong federal government best (Federalists) vs weak federal government (Democratic-Republicans). even back then, Democratic-Republicans hypocritical populists talked every man pushing rich men used federalist banks (which opposed) physically grow nation powers didn’t quite would oppose.

However, modern conservatives beyond hypocrites. organized party advocates hardline stances. tied Newt Gingrich 1990s giving president Bill Clinton ultimatums shutting government response. Mitch McConnell recent years adopted toxic version philosophy. less explains Congress messed leadership coming there.

At state level, republicans largely suck jobs run platform small government. words, run platform elected sit ass nothing. 

With Republican president “me first,” Republican senate actively opposes anything democratic, states want everything magically go away, left dysfunctional government flying seat pants. Wonder happens? probably truck Florida, cause Florida's sand trucked too. start with, opening schools. Sweden never closed schools (for children 16).

Also heard comparison Finland close schools.

Also, Sweden recently increased testing dramatically. thing wife wanted got married homemaker raise children. refused cook clean saying 50s anymore. Kids underweight ate cereal chef boyardee place always dump. I'd get home 10 hour shift throw hot pockets microwave supper cook us meal. would also threaten saying sex 2 weeks get dishes done etc. i'd get home work. joke partnership pushed workforce household chores taking care kids stay home dad. hates working love staying home chores inbetween rounds CoD matches. feminist movement best thing ever happened always remind 50s anymore complains work stay home kids. I'm curious Georgia. opened early along Texas, seem devastation do. Georgia less major cities outside Atlanta? 

Or numbers Georgia high state reporting them? got back vacation cut slack rush them. They're trying figure make companies immune lawsuits spreading covid. favourites are: Tim Hortons, McDonald's, Second cup, Starbucks. Bigger cities chains independent shops. yeah always seems Tim's McDonald's, mostly smaller cities towns ones there. Using immediate extended family data point... anti-vaxxers vaccine-hesitant minority scares me. Haha ok, multiple mayors state enact mask restrictions said nothing nothing black woman enacts mask restrictions accidentally sues none others? 

How ""stupidly"" target single mayor lawsuit? South Florida school boards already told shove ass Phase 3 trials already running Brazil month people don’t understand much affect every facet healthcare country. Iceland, Norway, Denmark Finland managed quite well without mask stay-at-home orders though. maybe clear cut people think. Texas health department numbers match numbers Texas archive weekly reports back several years. verify numbers modified since original final report 2018-2019 season runs September thru September. 10020 deaths pneumonia influenza. latest report 2019-2020 season currently reporting 9070 deaths. pneumonia deaths incorrectly counted? likely deaths tested Covid-19 counted incorrectly. huge conspiracy either looking numbers, would need several thousand death increase end July September deviate historical average looking past reports many time frame would obvious. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now someone wanted pull deaths time period see elevated deaths (heart attack/unknown) make case I'm seeing it. Ever met truck driver recovering lung cancer? guy know gives shit. thing Kentucky local government actively trying bar governor making COVID 19 mandates. Literally go KY supreme court right now. Also locally, southern states, taken seriously mitigated governing bodies yeah. Hopefully wake call people bringing suits it. ???? peak 15k 10k several days  important ? Freedom movement Sweden right life ? Commonwealth commonhealth, back line! Call them. Tell feel course fucking GOP;er.

Why ""politician"" treated criminal?

Because is. Unlike United States, countries legal authority mandate enforce mask usage nationwide. he’s physically unable walk away podium limelight. It’s like birthday kid can’t beat piñata, doesn’t want let kid break either . says stupid adult break apart Payroll tax cut.... people jobs. 

Genius. /r/conservative user, wasting time. ""The sheriff said he’s gotten 25 percent requested far funding security..."" test absolutely everyone, would need test lot currently testing, yes. Though would argue one whole points would test people--in states already demand tests capacity. see pro sports employers would like ability test generally non-infected employees. Scar tissue lungs oxygen several years sound like ever like used to. Yeah triggering immune response equate triggering sustained immune response. would take three months see ones fade like normal ones do. Agreed later nerd allow remote learning safety next breath allow sports close contact? Wow that's pretty hardcore. axe?? find dailymotion apparently Canadians allowed see this... ??? Parts US regularly reporting zero new deaths. 

Texas really dealing first wave now. virus hit everywhere time. Yeah get either. like anywhere federal worker steps temporarily becomes federal land. postal worker follow local traffic laws, seems like worker would also follow local laws. I'm afraid right. zero. Nova Scotia 0 cases time. American lied going, quarantine, infected one person, infected 3 4 cases American fined $1000 banned Canada. friend stupidly admitted smoking pot life banned entering US. bullshit.

Edit: Nova Scotia NFLD New Jersey closing schools, re-opening sports? shutting schools driven science politics, would one explain re-opening sports? Yeah, fake news sets stage Presidential run 2024. People sub fucking insane sometimes.

They’re eager dismiss anti-mask conspiracies virus hoax conspiracies (and rightfully so) insane speculation like comment responded get lauded upvoted. sucks man. best friend recently got married wife Canadian citizen. even let country wife. like since borders closed down. wishes went chance, too.

Then quacks come ""Im GUNna MoVE ti CANdada"" 

No. used nephew example, he's one closest happening to, know jus him, way more... Also, forget mentioned regarding company hiring. never happened before, suddenly nobody wants work, unemployment levels roof... add up. People milking like mofo, always expected people like that, damn...
My brother co-workers started asking less hours company, qualify unemployment. One showed check $2 change, also qualifies 600 bucks, received amount too... Dude, Brazil even exist. Every single country except United States completely eliminated COVID. /s  Prior this, husband went eat least times week. splurge, thing together. thought sure we'd first ones back restaurant restrictions lifted. 

Restaurants open indoor dining two months - set foot one imagine there's either vaccine readily available treatment. like cook, found takeout perfectly fine stand-in either want cook can't make liking. 

And yet see friends relatives social media, posting inside restaurants bars like nothing's ever happened. get it. vaccine able protect covid opinion statement falsifiable there's us immunocompromised might able take can't complain. company's precaution currently, ""WFH December 31st. that..we'll see."" maybe took picture setting up? brick headed twatward sports defense, think would help mental health millions Americans able watch favorite sport stuck home. Whether football, baseball, basketball, hockey, whatever. definitely helps economy well. get fucked end? That’s idiotic piece reporting. confusion: *wear fucking mask*. 

Even Kemp urging everyone wear mask. He’s damn fool emphasizing news articles like aren’t helping like could. 

**wear damn mask** wish vaccines worked way unfortunately don’t get ~70% population buy create herd immunity, leave room virus propagate mutate vaccine longer provides effective protection start vicious cycle again. protection never perfect first place, saw Measles outbreak 2015 despite high MMR vaccination rate Uh yeah are, know plenty people are. $600, plus get state. I'm Colorado, $618 state benefits $600 federal. know downvoting accusing people exaggerating easier, try little research maybe? Thank proving point though, clearly agree way much since thought viable climate change.

It seems like people forgot AUS insane fires January made sky red Melbourne Sydney. Definitely, long degree job match something NAFTA list. could mean people, sick Covid symptoms, aware hospitals overwhelmed staying home trying tough out.

They also may getting cars driving, someone drive them, states treatment. include research staff too? Especially clinical research staff carry research progresses medical science knowledge? am, considered essential. Human trials United States heavily regulated. I’m sure things pushed along fast COVID, I’m guessing won’t seeing US trials soon. Even didnt care human aspect, going absolutely massive legacy. Gets vaccine everyone jump starts economy. helped steer US two worst economic disasters ever Bruh second place get gold medal, always case ""fuckwad"" 
""fuckface"" anyone explain would order 100 million doses gotten FCC approval gotten past phase 3?

I'm vaccine soon possible, seems like bad financial decision. mostly agree. let Fauci run show back off. would prevent political issue given plausible deniability? That's million dollar question me. see bull that's dangerous rampaging thinks randomly, I'ma ride bull rather run away. want understand part. stock supplies people. Start rotating according expiration date. Staples, beans, rice chicken. Depends vaccine. might suitable healthy population receive it. sarcastic guy seemed imply OP power one vote get rid every shitty American politician. probably already has, reached testing capacity. ""approve use"" US.

The did. gave emergency use authorization. since revoked (COVID-19) Update: FDA Revokes Emergency Use Authorization Chloroquine Hydroxychloroquine Florida care willing sacrifice teachers ... uh ... something ... really pretty undefined, it? That's Mars' news cycle little behind.  I've screaming years one listening? fucking sea hag Betsy DeVos wanted cabinet position solely purpose. longer must scream inside hearts  told need learn German want stay... Back days Spanish flu threw shitheads like jail conduct study, theoretical can't force people inject something studied extensively educate people benefits vaccines 'Bout damn time! think missed nap today. say? doctor, sounds like allergies dehydration me. get hay fever sometimes? get headaches sinuses stuffed up, dizzy ears stuffed up.

OTOH, covid seems affect people differently knows. could get test.

I hope feel better. Please eat healthy food take care yourself. another stock pump dump scheme gonna absolute shitshow.


It billionaires willing sacrifice lives players fans keep money flowing. Make mistake that. Sure, much easier days socialize remotely, nothing make actual human human contact. That's excuse going on. Certainly undisciplined people ruining all. However, I'm saying see coming from. point pandemic I'm willing bet everybody thought ""I really want X. X activity prolongs promotes pandemic. Rational disciplined people think critically effects actions. Others? much

It's horribly frustrating, think less I'm surprised what's going America. lived certain length time exposed narcissistic selfish society. Perhaps idiot believing people would change came illness, suffering, death. managed 240 hours vacation time last shut down. work healthcare. going use PTO vaccine. going get shut fall. guess late October gets cold north east. May made perfectly alert 40 year old man brain dead, look line going! I’m sure asked poor deceased man, would said “nah don’t worry me, I’d honoured die upward line hospitals profits” going throw there. believe insulate lawsuits. think stance follow guidelines put forth state,  compliance. go guidelines, create argument aware risk posing employees customers. poor argument boxes position experts would anything mandated city state know best.

&amp;#x200B;

Other businesses like Costco tell get wear mask. Blanket enforcement. Costco likely opinion better position. Medical bills less due fewer employees sick likely customers. Lawsuits easier defend since policies excess state local requirements.

&amp;#x200B;

This understand this. come insurance companies dictating behavior? going eat lot big medical bills due clients acting best interest employees health.  insurance company, would threaten increase rates pull renew coverage. hospitals overwhelmed? believable. Ah yes sure. know one...

Ready?

They're morons could get results back negative picked corona 4 days ago go think fine  Woohoo hot buttered bullshit 489 New cases, 7 new deaths could without racism bruv. immigration restrictions intense makes US Mexican border look like jump rope.

I got admission UofT grad school spring part regrets accepting :( *Stares NY, looks Ohio Michigan.*

Some places border better experiences others... mind boggles. they’re saying idea measure productivity beyond observing long someone sits desk. way indicator productivity (it’s incredibly easy sit desk look productive nothing.) also means apparently paying managers knows much (likely people actually work) observe long people sit desks rather than, know, managing people. That’s stunning level incompetence that’s probably costing enormous amount completely unnecessarily. Best become mandatory. That's issue. username concerning. Hey ohhhhh hey ohhhhh hey carona! think crucial reason referring babysitting. fact. little kids germy count little kids easier manage. try right thing focus there. real problem. People can't leave little kids home, I'm betting little ones going spread thing like wildfire. Even amusing decades long parroting hear america anytime anyone suggests making immigration policy even remotely strict country entire world. ""Racist!"" sex education schools easy access birth control people could actually keep getting pregnant shouldn’t be. considered ethically good purposely infect someone virus cure for. debate whether purposely inject people speed along vaccine trials though, scientists weighing option. testing without batching testing excess 5 million week. disagreement point. certainly locations backlogs batch testing going really impact anyway. Jesus christ, came home college NC family completely sane almost every way, parents got political shit last night. 

Their mindset horrifying. beleif disease real wearing mask make difference, anyone age 60 demographic risk effectively dead already (both like mid-50s btw), believe already disease despite taking tests. (Btw apparantly running millions tests per state time rest world stopped lying numbers) 

New york apparently ""only bad"" governor shipped covid patients nursing homes, effectively killing them. work democrats want nation shut ussurp power trump (I asked work dems, convince foreign countries shut economies well, got answer) 

I'm physically repulsed Fox news point they've clearly gone rails normal manipulative rhetoric point convince good people outright reject simplistic science guise ""preserving history freedoms"". 

Dont even get started opinions BLM protests... also posted website, short time, traditional Chinese medicine effective treatment China threatened withhold funding didn't. also refused classify pandemic pretty late game (Mid/late March?). January March, sub covid subs fuming inept though this. 

It's revisionist all. happened, many paying attention time. Yes Remember Utah Jazz entire team/staff (80+) got tested time nearly impossible order test? exposing people virus part study Sure, give priority highest need. honest it. 

Our government lied citizens, told us ""masks work"". spent almost 5 months telling lie, huge numbers repetitions. damage done. undo it, take 7 times (that's guess) effort. 

There reason lie first place. could pulled medical grade products shelves. friend respiratory therapist (sans phone, since patients sedated) patients removed ventilator.  Absolutely brutal job. seems holding fine emotionally now.  Accepting masks social distancing course prevent spread, plausibility idea virus moves region burns matter what? burned northeast northwest first, things continue stable (with masks/distancing), hit midwest stabilized, southwest (which article true starting stabilize). mean Florida/Texas might right around corner? 


It's interesting watch hard-hit European countries follow trajectory. US huge seems affected region region part study good points. dumb statement. Working class people main victims economic health impacts Covid. Attempting divert funding testing mitigation efforts craven political ploy certainly harm working class people. 29 hour delay fetching comments.

Remindme! 4 weeks smart thing be
HOLD MAH BEER WATCH THIS!! - Merica agree this. didn’t really notice polarized mask issue Plandemic. posted item two masks Facebook page that, nary ripple controversy. Plandemic came out, little afterwards posted article Austria cut infection rate 90% masks mandated, highly opinionated person one time best friend confronted “surgeon general said didn’t good”, next thing know she’s posting kinds Plandemic nonsense. start cherry picking audience wanted say anything virus fear getting confronted arguments time. wasn’t Plandemic came noticed mask controversy. know details ""why"" yet, I've seen lot mentions around avoiding Moderna questionable practices (stock price manipulation example one those). pulled number right hat lol guy video talks umbrella. assure using umbrella hot sun totally normal country. frequently get weird look I'm using one. 90% sure I've corona, nonsense isnt really impressive. God hope.  Yeah sucks more. luxury almost never leaving house - working office, groceries curbside pickup, video chatting friends family. leave house rarely, get groceries, filled gas tank last months.

Then there's flip side equation, essential workers taking care sick would take care got sick, bagging groceries putting curb, people keeping shit running. want vaccine. Trump clearly denial... wonder anger set in.... refreshingly honest read. Thank taking time produce figures. Yep. one syringe company, one smaller ones.

* May 12: DoD HHS $138 million contract ApiJect 100 million prefilled syringes distribution across United States year-end 2020, well development manufacturing capacity ultimate production goal 500 million prefilled syringes 2021.
* June 9: HHS DoD announced joint effort increase domestic manufacturing capacity vials may needed vaccines treatments:
  * $204 million Corning expand domestic manufacturing capacity produce additional 164 million Valor Glass vials year needed.
  * $143 million SiO2 Materials Science ramp capacity produce company’s glass-coated plastic container, used drugs vaccines.

The bad news. BARDA much money allocated Congress. Quite frankly, need more. every day it, time vaccine widely available know one works. like disregard human life. seems like cares re-election, regardless happens, that's real leader lead.

Being leader making sacrifices betterment people. believe falling trap way. use pushing hard skeptics deniers fall reality bandwagon way.

I believe covid-19 ridiculously serious business, treat rather make baseless claims try puff one side other. wearing masks distancing, shutting helping medical system. type article rubs wrong way -- feeds disinformation cycle allowing not-great acquaintances show they're right fake news. Front-page one read sites internet kid negative covid test, vomiting must covid-death. ammo defend article deniers, wish published. autopsy shows one, let's go full steam ahead. let's get ahead lest get run bus making. coworker family enthusiasts, they're still planning go month. Pretty curious hear goes. August seem fun time even without mask. Indoor protests banned California. Try again. U.S. overall, model projecting go yesterday’s 3.7 million reported cases ... around 4.8 million 15 days now. I’m assuming, Dr. Redfield, ten times many people actually infected given day reported case data shows, means maybe 8-10 million Americans really don’t want around time.

His relaxed approach issue welcome helping gird loins keep teens within guidelines. hurts see suffer, ultimately much would see permanently disabled thing refuse even think about. 6 years get 10,000 new cases every day

Edit - yes, everyone knows ""real"" rate everyone knows rate constant. smart, gold stars everyone. answering OPs question long would take *at rate*, aka rate stated headline. LA County needed another stay home order last month. Ya'll ain't gonna lockdown hush it. Let’s hope I'm Myrtle Beach. insane many people dont care. People wear masks inside right get stores door take off. Beaches crowded tourism. Roads crowded. I'm ashamed Country right now. go house week grocery shop. cant pay step inside walmart. worst expect case?  

The worst possible side effect death.

Here's example less-harmful side effect mixing flu  
Growing up, knew kid age diagnosed Reyes Syndrome.

When wee lad, remember hearing swine flu everyone age innoculated school:   

I stumbled across ad/PSA swine flu vaccine:  program began, vaccine associated increase reports Guillain-Barré Syndrome, cause paralysis, respiratory arrest, death.  

And little later, got hear Legionnaire's Disease 1976. Strangely enough, read article recently talked Legionaire's Disease making another appearance dormant office buildings around US begin re-open covid-19 shutdown. Bad news always comes threes. :-(  

I remember listening Walter Cronkite read updates first swine flu later Legionnaire""s 
Disease many nights CBS Evening News. 
   Thank much do! rest healthcare workers absolutely heroes! hope god blesses ok? So, um, let dock? Yeah Trump degree Wharton. Degrees don’t mean good judgment. Bad judgment stupid. They're paying mean pump dump. course they're going take money kind special medical unit. bathtub curve strikes! I'd give left arm able go concerts key time flu/cold season gets full swing. Otherwise, vaccine help lot still control then. Remember 100% protect help fight easier contain spread. know specific role obviously, I'm hospital social worker. housekeeping EVS staff incredible. woman see unit hardest working person I've ever met. major high five everyone role anywhere disinfecting cleaning. 

Shout woman Rosa helping keep area clean.  Vaccines 100% effective anyone vaccinating could infect someone vaccinated hear yourself? said want wear mask 24/7 home sooo you’re sleeping, taking shit, showering, exercising. I’m sure could think rational person would this. Right. one person sent article like previous this. say lockdowns spread covid. say breathe good enough wear mask. say people can't social distance they'll go crazy. say we're careful, numbers stay - everything better.  get it? work worse off. Imagine... conversation mom bite tongue cavalier virus going kill dad becomes fruitless argument every time. would nice. Dont forget take ivermectin you! works! What's significant social political idea someone could hold opposite without entailing rational empathetic deficiencies? Exactly, lied first place. liar, people believe again.

They knew enough mask go around, truthful ramp production.

Remember Fauci saying this. CDC, ton medical professionals propagating lie. People reddit want Covid thing bad possible. get it. got me, friend  thankfully majority Americans juvenile mindset. Thanks proving category fall into. want pandemic end, also want online school stay. healthcare workers kids supposed they're work? Yeah, part planning getting production going people companies telling 2 years get many time make orders secure financing ramp ups. 

Bright says 2 syringes per person Covid amidst documented surge increased flu vaccine use public that's documented pandemic areas, around 840 million syringes.

So literally 18.6% using overall numbers.

So again, unless start rationing syringes everything else, 2 years said. Good job, mod! proactive keeping touch people (and meeting new people, getting back touch old friends) beginning pandemic, bunch Zoom meetings like, I've letting things slip lately. reply someone gets touch me, done great job reaching out, beyond leaving comments Facebook. sure, good number know wanted take opportunity get there! Depends are. places low risk enough. hope vaccine produces antibodies vital surface protein. One mutate. However we've let things go long enough mutations everywhere. entirely likely vaccine smash hit like DNA viruses. likely vaccine year's strain, it'll like flu vaccine. would rather widely available vaccine win lottery. heard H1N1 vaccine caused narcolepsy small amount recipients. 100% sure that’s fully proven.  No, people need help can't figure joke themselves. Target won’t either. 

Ultimately puts team members risk bodily injury don’t want lawsuit. American shithole? going hard time I'm curious, travelled much? I've 40 countries trust say, Americans really, really good. recently said expected one ready [by end Agree completely. Still want see specific data kids, it’s possible chance infecting others (outside parents) symptoms certain level lower, maybe come plans critical child care options. Childcare essential workers ends taken elderly relatives approved daycares, would better safe, viable plan people work even lockdown without sacrificing family’s elders. really sounds like need solution youngest grades (k-2) students certain disabilities. could get really specific data last unknowns, might possible solve problems safely. Without objective data, we’re gambling vulnerable. isn’t acceptable.

And yeah, I’ve found hard believe parent caught young kids—it would physical difference limiting infection happen (like less ace2 whatever’s something, lol). Kids COVERED germs slime .. parents would lose minds didn’t adjust normal. Parents young children likely getting TON coronavirus kids, surely get enough get sick? Someone Costa Rica can't pop client office time apartment face-to-face meeting. There's need spend hour getting across town use exact laptop phone different desk. Yes that’s assuming government actually people compliant. countries far. least mature enough recognize made mistake... many politicians days deflect deflect.. LOT people taking seriously flabbergasted it. open restrictions Wisconsin  visited NYC hospital, remember correctly, saw reacted semblance humility towards bad was. quickly power, ego, lure votes overtook even small sense empathy him. Face shield, eyepro, mask. face shield lmao phase approach makes perfect sense....once Covid better handled/a vaccine ready. U mean Donald?1 enough want get I'll damnedest make sure don't. case curve looks precisely like normal curve, epidemiologists use model viral spread. assumptions back basic biology follow:

\-Virus spread starts accelerating pace, single person infect one

\-People already infected can't obviously new case, people already infected recovered less likely get infected again. Growth naturally decelerates, first linear growth decelerating growth, reaching peak

\-After peak cases starts decreasing, people recovered dying people getting infected. Decrease first starts accelerating pace, deaccelerate till zero (the model symmetric). would enforce 14 day quarantine incoming travelers, US clearly incapable Yep. Taking slowly. gym months going died think worse places go trying avoid contracting virus. went school bunch people I'm pretty sure would super spreaders. f\*cking way I'd set foot classroom student. already happened NY. much true, virus make use coping mechanisms difficult impossible, therapy groups cancelled. sadly help case.  fair, Cuba known health education pretty damn solid. Italy called Cuban doctors help pandemic. Somehow get morphed argument stop contact tracing weenie saying week. really blew reopening sit back take want accept pennies master. Others taking anymore, wages huge joke people suffering enough. capability establishing UBI sets minimum standard living wage, tiny snip military spending, simply taxing rich they're supposed taxed. time evolve. death poverty. life others worth it, including yours. country universal healthcare less. R.I.P Estimated 60-100,000 backlogged tests Arizona big reason “decline cases” Kinda reminds group homework school one teammates slacks off. 

Doug Ducey Dr Cara Christ 100% fault situation in.  Appalachian Fatalism Pandemic Style control group trial published today got meningitis vaccine.

Useful comparing side-effect profiles known vaccine groups exactly population demographics reporting methodology. Sorry clear comment, ‘we’ meant America. hope sarcastic. trials taking place UK first British university everything already place. countries would wade miles bureaucracy pay get set facilities staff ideal time factor. Nationalism nothing it, especially they've already said they'll freely share vaccine.

Just thank god developed US they'd charging world billions buy it. single person color hmmmmm misspelled dead.  Texas never first peak, happens actually control people stop giving shit. spot one black person room. So, make evidence lacking assumption heavy right supporters. issue idea seems predicated thought Americans, fearful virus, engaging economy. 

But doesn’t seem played out. 

It seems, by-and-large, Americans care virus living life like doesn’t exist. 

Everything packed since lockdown ended. looked life, wouldn’t even know virus existed. 

I’m sure Americans really going change anything. continue living though virus doesn’t exist. thing keeping sectors fact aren’t open. 

When opened, they’ll print money again. 

This belief don’t lockdown, economy even worse doesn’t seem actually true. 

Which scary though we’re back lockdown kill economy let economy rip virus spread, meaning people personal risk assessment they’re likely harmed virus poverty. 

And they’re going choose getting virus continue prosper large percentage. Posted many many times. bottles thrown? disappointed, Florida Man. *You* know that, people reading ""CORONAVIRUS VACCINE"" probably see early access human guinea pig experiment. spare tire chained trunk fool steal spare; shame you. shame me.

Despite this, none cars burgled anything. think simply go oldest model. also never windows busted.  crazy trying explain bar going mother can't see grandkids anymore refuses get tested exposed covid. say mom America? come from... lol :-) I'm hoping know ""I've always done way"" actual argument thing. 

Me, I've never voted person US left country first election eligible vote in. explicitly request absentee ballot time, sign it. 

I've voted countless times Israel (three times last year!). person, ID, election day, putting slip paper envelope putting envelope box. Fraud nearly impossible. may kinds political problems, possibility fraud even one them.  said, particular case representative general American health care. Actual experiences vary wildly region. hospitals PPE masks workers; others hazmat suits positive pressure masks. Moderna vaccine going rubbish and/or difficult scale comparison? second wave US would likely mean mutation COVID 19. first wave end majority population simply containment efforts complete shit. believe a, drunk driving towards economic catastrophe. really depends successful Trump year either stopping election happening, outright refusing step voted out. 

Now know people going say, ""Wait, Trump can't that""... except we've saying since took office Congressional/Senate Republicans backing full support anyhow. That's check Executive office, back matter what, yes, absolutely that. check Executive power longer exists, live dangerous time moment.

If Trump successful that, Republican governors may well pull move voted out.

- schools provide free meals millions students. made available students ways, families haven’t picked up
- schools provide escape support network kids bad family lives
- schools provide built structure routine hard parents impose home, especially working parents
- person instruction, especially kids 12, provides lot stuff online instruction can’t
- social development benefits hard replace
- kids falling behind, gaps widening poor rich kids. Poor kids may access laptops, internet, even books house rich families hiring private tutors
- don’t know kids ever able catch loss instruction far. Even normal summer break causes pretty significant losses
- kids disabilities, schools provide many resources including occupational, physical, speech therapy. 
- kids also receive counseling/therapy schools, free. schools provide things like vision, hearing, scoliosis screens, flu shots, rudimentary medical care (my public high school associated health clinic) 


Now y’all downvote me, I’m saying means open schools!! Personally oppose right now. it’s unfair pretend isn’t real harm done keep closed. Schools provide LOT services really life line many kids. sometimes feel like racial things discussed, we're 'not invited discuss racism' since racism overt immediately obvious races. try show support minorities get course corrected exasperatingly told 'but really well compared us!' ... entirely believe experience told 'just take it, blend in, fine, relevant, visible.'

America's 50% obese effectiveness flu vaccine based strain targeting. vaccine effectively targets strains 2019 SARS Coronavirus engineered target part virus strains think mask keeps safe, wear one. worry people. 30-40%, um CDC said must atleast 50% effective more. OK hold up. sounds like we're talking insignificant blip single data point longer. sounds like believe scientists health officials world sticking fingers data try push agenda virus dangerous really is? spite U.S. president? go dude! downplaying dangers virus. he's actively talking little know organ failure virus. mention concerns long term repercussions virus surviving inside like HIV Chickenpox Shingles.

You idea yet confidently telling people super rare biggy. that's experts saying.   quick aside, great book! Downvoted “edit” Apparently planes even bad.

Do local news sources recommend? don’t mind needing run translator. That's silly oh wait... Teacher here. age, socializing extremely important, feeling isolated absolutely damage mental health.

However, physical health fragile, recommend looking ways socialize without in-person school. daughter going 2 friends school time house. get work done, able help other, get hang out. families mask wearers socially distance, risk level lower going school 1,500 students, many come families believe virus hoax, refuse wear masks follow reasonable prevention measures.

That may option you, please talk parents think outside box. alone, put life danger either. exactly that. ton money... hoarded ""elite."" Cashiering used allow doable quality life. lucky covers basic, basic living expenses even working *years* - fulltime hours, health coverage, maybe roommates. Governor (hand) Desan'tiser.

im sorry America festering worse several countries combined. Putting money pool means benefit it, mean throw away return, I'm speaking purely socialist economy. need give everyone pool money keeps wheel spinning. people remain jobs there's enough jobs snowballs, people's lives matter matter miniscule perceive virus threat being. realize capability getting everyone mere tiny snip military spending alone correct? realize politicians right sprinting give big businesses rich safety nets nobody else correct?

Hard express fucking stupid people charge state are. biggest hero state income tax. That’s I’ve got. one, too, thank goodness! :( cools bedroom, it’s sure better nothing!! :) say that?

edit: jfc can't even ask basic question without getting downvoted. wondering could see source. rude standard vaccines give everyone generally highly effective, they’re recommended everyone. example, per CDC: 

One dose MMR vaccine 93% effective measles, 78% effective mumps, 97% effective rubella.

Two doses MMR vaccine 97% effective measles 88% effective mumps.

But plenty vaccines evaluated Phase 3 trials end far less effective. vaccines demonstrated promising enough immunogenicity spend $100 million phase 3 trials.

Hopefully case here... we’ll see. Same. comorbidities put high risk catching covid high risk severity. Also pregnant planning breastfeeding. don’t feel comfortable given situation timing jump right in.

There’s many medications OTC can’t take health conditions including ibuprofen. Taking really dangerous me. it’s common medication safe nearly everyone else. don’t want risk right away body already needy/unique seems like jumping right away isn’t great idea. weddings happen lockdown? deemed essential Germany, allowed couple two witnesses Standesamt. Ugh filled Reno trash We're going banned everywhere pretty soon. Florida killing it!

And 'it', mean citizens. sounds fun :/ Ya agree that’s one big problems healthcare workers conditions poorly managed funded hospitals. makes situation little worse that’s government step unfortunately won’t us people need somehow find way make better snark, thought Ohio well. Wake September ends feel like I'm missing something here. *Everything* read prior article stated December earliest realistically public vaccinations sort broad scale, even timeline essentially unprecedented. days ago read article different promising vaccine starting Stage 3 trials Brazil.

So Oxford's team going public (meaningfully widespread) vaccine available 3 months anyone said would one?

Thanks. Thank &lt;3 noticed sworn husband first week two self isolation whole 20 years together. Luckily went better that, I'm sure needed get frustration (unhealthy way know) got used self isolating. Lucky us, solid marriage affect us long run, rocky marriage see causing divorce. true? It’d nice go outside without paranoid anti maskers coughing  sub started good source global information quickly toxic waste dump. Nearly every thread rabid anti American narrative. People flat sing Americans deserve die, acting happy number Americanswho died, etc. really terrible community. Yeah, negative test negative test.

The virus may gone blood clots damage still there. Shit fuck life. guess still ""He must co-morbitities"" camp roll dice. See win. feel like US based sub, expecting early access something developed manufactured UK/Europe? You’d think they’d take care first. 

Even export “the recipe” would take months US get capacity. Active antibody levels active protection levels. Memory cells store learned threat activate produce antibodies needed.

The reason people get Flu shots every year ""wears off,"" mutates enough updated vaccines likely effective currently circulating strains.

Do reliable source evidence people getting ""reinfected"" COVID sort large scale (ie, single anecdotes)? wild. gone backwards testing LA County. 

In mid-june able schedule test within 2 days county website, got results 6 hours. 

Did hit threshold county accomplish testing? screwed federal administration help testing? Oh, see, extra trillion Trump added debt proof economy well.

I misinterpreted this. many months production distribution.

they're already starting mass produce now. think winter see infect people. deniers think go away election, think that’s really kick off. 

It’s sad pretty mean, can’t wait say told so. Yep, Gates footing bill assumption money (all candidates one) wasted. savings human life worth it.

I presume there's partially effective vaccine they'll run cost-benefit analysis etc. Right... Exactly bothered antibody tests become available area past 2 4 weeks. person work closely got deathly ill beginning March went ER tested negative antibodies month ago. give PCR test back idea was. Headline: Reddit followers gets clickbaited another reinfection story 3 months falling it. care much restaurants, concerts, games.

u.s cuba ages embargo place till population starves hope rise government. Yes! I’ve always said that’s done. Thank you!  Ah yes. Oxford, England, probably working hard interfere US elections. Sound logic. Yeah year...like flu vaccines. Anyway, people get vaccine September / October long lasting ones ready everyone get those. don’t really see problem it’s avoid people dying unnecessarily restarting society. vaccine achieves  Truth cook meals home. live really rural part Texas takeout sucks. don’t want kids. Rn I’m teacher summer break lucky enough (I guess?) school going virtual. We’re seeing lot losses community. 

My husband also works home atm. company working towards maybe going back. Yes, you’re right. children vaccinated! Canadian lived Texas couple years, Alberta decade, truth. Ideally make rotation system every mask left alone 7 days use, approximately long takes virus die mask surfaces, see research data. Note chart use log scale amount virus decrease exponentially time, inventors N95 mask said believe 3 days passive decontamination would sufficient enough virus would survive infectious dose. Hospital staff putting paper bags de-contaminate, use plastic bags may trap moisture prolong virus lifespan, theoretical limit many times re-used long rubber bands tight. Good luck business thank taking care staff! Exponential Growth + Disregard = Shit Show ignore pediatricians also saying benefits outweigh risks? children dont spread nearly much? Oh wait dont listen professionals. 

[AAP reopening people social, crowded markets, people feeling safe wearing facemask necks poor health system, we're fucked Theyre actually causing harm instead. Trump litetally told governor (california) he'll give state covid aid personally ask trump thank him. Basically kiss ass publicly. administration also sent 170 ventilators broken.  UVEX Honeywell key phrase ""of known transmissions"". go look everyone near you, see figure got it, see that's indoors outdoors. since large percentage people can't get figure got for, essentially reliable numbers end. know 50% transmissions, instance, 50% - therefore essentially half transmissions - could outdoors (but probably think paper thinking of, least abstract good read. one read /r/COVID19 somewhere, probably also hosted medrxiv. genuinely curious following science, I'd recommend reading (I try avoid commenting even voting; leave academics) /r/COVID19. Chips smokes.. let’s go. holding up? ship refitted help corona patients - 4 days later. self-selecting facts? completely irresponsible Cuomo send virus back population effected it. don’t know people acting like options? Thousands died. truly tragic Cuba still crippled sanctions, despite that, manage provide relative care people see work succesfully poor nation, richest nation planet abandoned citizens.

&amp;#x200B;

Love people Cuba, really blissfull despite knowing poor bad got it, deserve better.  Honestly, fact Trump Trump might reason solid chunk country even gets vaccine. Like Obama's administration distributed vaccine, one everyone country probably get, they'd absolutely refuse. goddamn idiot. Can't believe someone actually explain. you. 5 years old mental ability child. 

Do know go triage? locked down. every fucking country try flatten curve. know... thing everyone months constantly medja. 

It worked. Barely. we're runaway exponential growth catalyst idiots wear masks politicized shit fearless leaders ego.

Guess what? we're going go triage undone. states mine included 80 percent capacity right now. 

There's fucking hope stopping spread now. That's scary fuck. know why? scenario described article.

But.... People like already got covid still recovering 6 months later likely reinfected probably much higher death tolls waves come numbers peak 100k plus day 200k plus day.

Covid attacks nervous system heart lungs. Respiratory people covid gave mild symptoms caused underlying issues in, like myself, high risk upon reinfection underlying cardiovascular conditions. 

Why think white house tried stop reporting numbers shown? doom gloom real possibility becoming reality due incompetence. ""Killer cells""? term quite literally never heard before. help keep alive, like 'em! :D love random redditer plenty money pay Kanye West huge corporations, tho. Wish could show guy said visits useful months back 😂 reputable Indiatvnews Thats awesome. Thats supposed handle it. country trying normalize death wants us accept 1000 deaths per day. Smh see downvoted, actually happened.

If know float air, put two two together. Expecting perfect contact tracing every illness ridiculous. I'm guessing intelligent floridians (like you) still go stores mandate masks now.

All karens probably fled stores bother wearing mask South Korea like Michael Jordan pandemics. Yeah, still many unknowns. It’s probably good they’re testing Brazil South Africa, well. seems like increases chance exposure multiple strains. believe read yesterday it’s believed six either mutations strains. someone’s comment, take boulder salt. might better result

So concluded yet. Ok, thanks.  Wrong demographic man. Reddit, support masks much circlejerk ""if wear mask 12 hours, groceries"" /r/pics. Imagine comment gets posted r/agedlikemilk 2024 lmao Oh good. Yes! Thanks Obama! Let's hope revoke ACA September. way sure one spreading it. Since million places get covid barely swim 50 without stop catch breath

Happy cake day dad custodian right scariest shit me. He’s 60 stroke don’t think gets props deserves go ahead get let know goes. works won’t get sick right? I'm moderator different subreddit.

A good politics policy tries eliminate things like nakely political debate like say Biden vs. Trump allow comments Federal government's response virus. big difference smart mods tell difference. believe science, really understand importance accuracy? Herd immunity, yes, Species immunity, no. Except vanishingly rare cooperative universal hard-push vaccine campaigns. don’t worry kid getting polio.

Three thousand years ago personal herd 50-300 people town people don’t travel herd immunity likely. Influenza hits town, people catch recover die, six months later sick tradesman arrives one catches 20 people didn’t catch aren’t directly exposed sick dude recovers. people directly caring buying stuff immune. Maybe stableboy gets sick, again, recovers doesn’t pass he’s surrounded recovered people. 7 billion people zooming planet via planes trains roads? gives rise way many quick spread routes. downside fell much faster Lombardy NYC less hard hit regions. I’d assume SARS-COV-1 SARS-COV-2 what’s industrial oxygen? Trumps silent majority going silent different reason. I'm saying study found 15% Madrid covid, actually showed 15% Madrid antibodies. covid antibodies. Meanwhile Trump threatening colleges least partially reopen Fall removing potential $50 Billion economy forcing foreign students leave country online classes available.  mean sending navy doctors such. armed forces statement slightly off.

I think dine-in shit things closed dumb though  lol, literally every country figured out.

Rent/mortgages/etc solved injection money public. 

We literally invented money. We’re bigger threat deflation inflation. cost injecting capital far less cost hundreds thousands millions dying. He’s highly educated person. Don’t confuse intelligence morality.  Thanks, thrown loop $2,200. Really expensive! They’re aiming infect entire population get 0 new daily cases, apparently. lol there's commenter sounds like they're ready leave wife leave house virus. :D Also, bullshit? (Im assuming didnt read article) also exponential growth like that. Confirmed: Coronavirus longer works weekends earning credit though-they supposed LEARNING material. eat rich. AZN already inked $1.2 billion deal us provide 300 million doses end year. Whoever, twenty-one years age guardianship, refuses neglects comply requirement shall forfeit $5.

I’m anti vaccine general anything rushed public I’ll pay $5 let someone else try first. Churches bars plenty crowded enough people still going either matter public transportation. easier. People bound determined undermine advantage. quite number studies coming suggesting antibodies might last months. might want check out. Would nice turns case, best cautious know beyond doubt. offense, exactly point: evidence confirmed outdoor transmission, evidence suggesting might possible (well, sure, might be). completely agree need wear masks indoors public spaces, maintain social distance, etc. seems crazy we're 7 months thing nobody point example confirmed outdoor transmission. One school near offering online schooling people dont sports  actually exposed earlier year large virus denier groups, anti lockdown groups, anti mask groups (the ones circulating crazy online social media) Russia, middle east, etc.

It pubbed like Post Times can't pissed Google it. [see overwhelming majority reported cases north outbreak began virus spreading good testing capabilities. south time react barely got hit, things control simply masks politicized huge gatherings still banned. Bad leadership top down. Gavin wait self imposed requirements neither LA. 

OC never cared paying it, lives. feel forced open classroom pandemic? Corona affecting USA since March. March September, that’s 7 months. 7 number fool. You’d fool get vaccine. tree fiddy Calculated risks seem lot time like lies tell something even though know good idea. here, he's even impotent trump. thought safe so, I'd pack bags get tomorrow. problem I'm sure part country safe, I'd leave country altogether could, many fucking Karens wear masks plane me.

Only thing think draw unemployment try find another job work home. hope remember blame people don’t follow rules. politicians citizens. interpreting they're saying wrong way.

What saying number people infected COVID definitely way higher current recorded numbers. However, number dead people from/with COVID accurate. 

What means 2.7% calculated recorded confirmed COVID cases reality add number non-recorded COVID cases (that is, people asymptomatic, never got tested never knew COVID) said percentage go dramatically.

The number death people COVID (and COVID) question; total number infected COVID is.

In layman terms; said 2.7% pessimistic number, real number close 1% consider early days, dead people survived hospitalization got tested healthy people infected COVID symptoms never got test. year 61,000. even assume half numbers COVID19 fabricated (which big/stupid assumption), it’s still lot worse flu way shorter amount time.

Well half current total would 65,000 6 months.

""Flu season"" 6 months long say 2017-18 61,000 deaths time period.

So that's equivalent.

Even dont cut Covid deaths half could say currently looking ""double bad flu season"".

I'm sure destroying economy worth ""double flu""? Oh did? Wait (retarded question) SARS COVID similar? Blood thinners Jesus imagine latam whole right now.

Take area like poorer regions Colombia even city like guayquil high levels crime poverty add pandemic fear desperation. 

Read article days ago cartels murdering anyone gets close keep covid out. 

I'd imagine latam whole firecracker waiting go right now.

Sadly best people ever met lived latam culture kindness unparalleled anywhere else. Definitely group deserves this. yeah also concern mine. last thing need vaccine effective Everyone knows trying exactly? doesn’t. They’re selling vaccine profit. money cannot charge recommended vaccines ACA. Thanks Obama. yelling echo chamber, actually wrong. guess say whatever want, behavior definitely part problem. 

these people ruining country us, they're getting benefit short term it. they're idiots know they're doing, they're making exchange, American lives gain. intentional, worse actually saying.

you're mistaking ""things disagree with"" stupidity. going get anywhere, well may make things worse. 

but honestly, super annoying. evil equal stupid. wtf wrong you? giving straw man focus trivially take down. taken outside. tried go back store, throw squad car, drive airport put next flight Florida rest kind. Hindsight 20/20 yeah imported cases spark back new wave easily 

you'd make entire world go measures unrealistic, completely avoid kind travel, also unrealistic modern economy Send America. Let’s treat America like use treat Australia. Send trashy people there. got absolutely traumatic. Seeing tragic outcomes healthcare worker expected, party picking lives dies...I hope they're given really clear protocols decisions made feels hands. get it. Bunch crybabies. Simple task end non sense think underestimate amount people either refuse take vaccine new anti-vaxers. Including people risk groups. wanna trade debts? Fortunately us, vaccines pretty well understood. *any* real evidence negative repercussions would hear anti-vaxxers. probably did, probably thought dollars immediately after. intended ppe. intended source control. good retaining respiratory droplets aerosols contain virus. means virus air others inhale landing public surfaces others might touch. means significant risk reduction people getting infected. 

It's called source control.  Ya go first I’ll see happens. Plandemic would successful government united around importance wearing mask. nation divided leadership divided. commitments production already 2 billion doses, AstraZeneca official said hoping 4 billion end 2021.

The $1.2 US order 300+ million doses, afaik already production least preparation production.  Oh thank god. Still though. Canadian, work along side many Americans Michigan, Ohio, Washington, Oregon, Illinois, Georgira, good sane people like none Trump people necessarily liberal. Trump loyalists scary yes, one way another, try hijack polls. lot done voter suppression. much democracy. worry, America believe Corona virus fake, worth caring about, need vaccines... long take development vaccine? read takes anywhere don’t 10-12 years. anyone confirm this? every one person kills, three get stroke graphic says. death rate 1% COVID, stroke rate 3% since 3x many people get strokes. Either that's graphic saying badly designed graphic disagreeing fellow Texans idiots however mask mandate counties 250$ fine violation posted elsewhere, relevant thing seen discussed much reason CDC forced suggest use March (which important inconsistent policy often cited anti-maskers). majority US production N95s made originally industrial use. Since FDA clearance, hospitals/GPOs legally purchase market. January, director BARDA screaming White House needed get approved medical use FDA emergency use authorization ([his house testimony long worth want context). took administration mid March push EUA place orders major manufacturers. I'd argue direct result delay forcing CDC suggest use industrial supplies bought up. already saw lot countries/distributors selling masks non-healthcare settings countries, administration acted January alarm bells rung, hospitals could legally purchased larger portion industrial n95 supply (and CDC forced admonishing use general opinion, administration's 2 month delay forced CDC issue notorious early guidance mask usage. administration acted January experts sounding alarm (allowing healthcare systems buy n95 supply earlier), CDC could much consistent mask policy. live Medina county go store (trying mostly order online) half customers wearing masks plus employees. frustrating. problem mask itself. principle situation. Less government more. government recommend want soon force people issue. found interesting information. RN specific department. So. ER, recovery, ICU, elective surgery whole bunch more.
Nurses care ICU patients, example, typically cover nurses departments. ICU could ace staffing issues, hospital could many nurses overall.
I always thought time emergency, everyone part game, reality always. Personally think staff parts hospital would better handle overflow.
1. know system.
2. hospital might lay staff non critical (due budget ICU overflow. Install battery tender. Cheap &amp; effective.  Karma meet people. Let's hope works. think vaccine honestly thing stop virus due many idiots either wearing masks social distancing. Yes. New York plan beforehand allow vulnerable die. knew it, warned accepted hospitals healthiest New Yorkers. Thank important point input!

/s

Do even need /s? feel need add one thing. poor part town great attendance percentage first week. Almost everyone got online, even using phones so. soon announced no-fail policy, out. three people absent week one, end three showing class.

There dozens opportunities kids pick computers hotspots school. feel like determining factor fall going accountability--if show up, get easy grade earn home. show, graduate. close park stupid means committing manslaughter unwittingly causing deaths others. 

If actually smart ... he's committing murder knows exactly he's doing. No, even half state hospitalized people still party. exactly it. I'm sick fake-news anti-mask crowd saying ""only X% death rate!!"" two outcomes getting covid: ""die"" ""perfectly fine"" welcome. currencies less obvious USD haha No. Fuck know Disney uses (Trey certainly case) there's new method queueing rides replaces standing line used parks. device...more less like buzzer get restaurant waiting party called table ready...that sync terminal sort near ride entrance, get time minutes return. let's continue walk around park stuff rather waste time standing  amateur numbers -- Florida He’s trying get 12.83% population 100%. No. earned good karma points bit early due good deed huge crisis. Call free bonus points. He's eligible next better level shitty lifetime. Bad ppl die later learned earned good karma looking forward JWST? Social distance wear mask, prick raise sociopaths. Especially among wealthy. pursuits without meaning purpose. Maybe silver lining here. Maybe clap back strong enough right ship. Like great depression created New Deal went produced greatest generation. Create universal healthcare. Restore unions protection essential workers. Fix education system make educators revered paid like doctors. Reverse obscene wealth inequality. Race inequality. Gender inequality. pass sensible gun  laws. People say I'm dreamer. I'm one. they've worked previous vaccine forget virus I'd start talking farm subsidies (farm bill second largest US expenditure, DOD first), too-big-to-fail bank loans, poisioning lands watersheds, always worried Cboe going pay season, able save seeds, well we've fighting right repair long. 


Until affects them, one seems care. Real r/leopardsatemyface progress there. God put shit? Ireland constituencies natural blob shaped, none squiggly line things have. wants avoid great depression. Sad say happening matter better save lives though economy crashes. That's good point. clarify never said go back person right away, I'm saying reason consider it. amazing took normal lives fore-granted. something taken away realize much meant you... You’re full shit Yep except like 3 countries Take tin foil hat Alex Jones. Alex Jones right? America great bunch people like going try hardest keep spreading virus? I'm pretty sure saw videos people downtown bar. Thanks everything guys do! That’s believable official number 274,000.   Surgeon General Fauci didn’t kickstart US COVID response proclaiming masks DIDN’T work masks exist. cannot stand them. Even pre-pandemic, group switched disposable kind straps break easily. really need someone else tie you. way many people are, let’s first try get people wear ear loop mask. 3M masks behind head style really awful long hair. You’re gonna need head covering well those. 

Sorry rant, basically I’m trying say depends wear mask. I’m sure really don’t like ear loop remove straps take hot glue gun fresh elastic modify them. Also, keep mind still shortage lot masks. least ear loops disposables again. where's vaccine then? bleeding stops eventually. deaths also attributed Covid 19 tests come back right? would still delay known deaths. Viruses need days too. enough rodeos know starts lot hype media product delivery, things turn really bad really fast. People start smelling money, fame, professional success, market dominance. Excitement greed quickly start override important considerations. theoretical, cynical, something I've seen real world times like remember. 

It's rare team keep head continue make sound, prudent decisions conditions. Agreed. Never underestimate stupidity, yet time I'm surprised Rip vaccine already likely found, matter getting tested safety approved, looking good far. gets worse ... still large segment population support think he's anything wrong. Hold second. clinical trials normally take like 12 18 months? could something like ready September Education viable alternative distance learning. Educational institutions also unique situation spread corona faster anything seen far. 

I’m teacher school that’s title one, yet 8 43 students living grandma grandpa. death rate 20%, that’s around 2-3 grandparents die class alone. 

My elementary school small, around 500 students. death rate .5%, that’s 2-3 ***children*** die school alone. high school 2500, that’s 10-13 students.

That’s much, let alone students overweight, asthma, underlying health conditions well adults school bring back immunocompromised spouses. 

Percentages fun they’re small. Schools fairly big ones attending don’t say what’s happening. 1 child dying going school much.  thought blew. I’m really hoping collective populace fucking something it, I’m worried it’s bystander effect action. Agreed. others removing masks altogether. good stock cloth surgical masks store, bothering. “In May, 45-year-old woman Jisr e-Zarka tested positive coronavirus readmitted Hillel Yaffe Medical Center Hadera, suffering fever chest pains. came month discharged recovering virus testing negative twice.” 

This woman symptoms second time, sounds like. doesn’t specify first time.  *\*throws hands air\**

Apparently! Agreed, people around people risk risk take precautions. I'm forcing things people consent, I'm taking voluntary precaution. much replying want believe, respect individuals consent consent to. Shes still coming work though?  I'd never forget pharmacist. He's one people I'd trust stick needle me.

Once vaccine here, I'm getting doctor. I'm getting pharmacist.

He'll always make time talk medical issue, always smile wave every time I'm grocery walk pharmacy. almost want say type announcements strategic. know 2nd lockdown pretty much unavoidable drop stories every week allow people prepare it, mentally. Ah ok thanks rolled fast doesn’t provide long term immunity issue was, it’s type vaccine give booster shots for. however good stopgap vaccines like BioNTech (December) Imperial College London (which cheap highly scalable vaccine aims reach ‘all billions people around world’ - use booster shots. read I’m Peru PEN ISO code Peruvian Sol. rich receive first.
Good luck all.  creativity made chuckle plan manufacture Thanks past 4 years buddy. fuck? 91k cases 2% Louisiana’s population. Sunday numbers always significantly lower weekdays? Curious. 1870s Redeemers coming power. essentially terrorism supported takeover state government people power Confederacy.  Things nothing like now, remotely.  U.K. think started challenge testing least 100 scientists approved it. Assuming someone White House doesnt arbitrarily decide block use benefit particular group people. hasn’t shut down?
People need wear masks get used idea may wearing YEARS Pretty much guy said, dichotomous variables (Y/N, +/-, anything 2 categories mutually exclusive) make testing easier. want add bit. experience research social science (like polling) might able clear differences. 

But political polls dichotomous too, like voting general election.Political polls trying generalize entire population say, instance, based 1000 poll responses election go one way another. people different thanks electoral college win one side isn’t simple winning majority vote. Even poll predicting majority vote small area, worry response bias sampling error, people changing votes, even intentional bad responses. It’s really hard predict attitudes general population truly sure 1000 random people representative everyone even small town, much less entire state. 

A medical study like suffers far fewer issues. select participants similar begin with, study isn’t trying generalize everyone. care people test group get virus exposed. course it’s unethical intentionally expose people virus, choose healthcare workers probably going exposed anyway. Assuming workers take precautions similar exposure chances, handle possible variables pretty easily show vaccine working fairly small sample size. need prove something, better random chance/placebo. 

Usually medical testing uses stringent tests statistical significance results, obviously can’t meet small sample. Instead get beginnings proof early send vaccine production continue study production underway. vaccine shown somewhat effective, least placebo random chance, it’s entirely waste later find it’s slight gain. Given year testing might meet strict standards, can’t wait long emergency. instead take chances “proven effective sure much so” vaccine giving risk groups first protection. point I'm half expecting block vaccines come out. Go Virginia!!! like term way They're willing sacrifice net result favor.

I wish kidding. It’s overall lack competence leaders getting us. Nothing new take reference US commenters. peoples careers “damaged” past certain percentage base rabid. margin small enough rig election. It’s playbook point. know it, use works. Every developed nation world much better control manage sane reopening that, horseshit. France gets life back, refusing takes

And frankly, horseshit 5 years claim. work tangential field. haven’t paying attention think 5 years away. cling support notion staying open healthcare system risk folks damned, like ignore every developed country (except Sweden) infinitely better are. 

Reality begs differ you. comment based nothing. that, definition, nobody built-up immunity **novel** virus. confirm Tennessee! 100% believe vaccines science, one little worried long-term effects vaccine? mean is, anyone else worried could cause something crazy road don’t know right vaccine going studied/trialed/invented matter year so? Actually not. Modi bigot, least took coronavirus seriously unlike Trump Bolsonaro. government tried lock preemptively cases still low anticipate mass migration lockdown triggered cities rural areas. need get job, like first daughter Ivanka ridiculous. know 7 people it. 4 needed hospital 2 intubated ICU almost 2 weeks. One still long term care. relearn walk, etc. took 2 weeks able feed himself. granddaughter ICU patient, early 20s. 

My Facebook feed full people going everywhere whatever hell want. Including childhood best friend aforementioned granddaughter. brother thinks huge hoax along live girlfriend. eldest child diagnosed type 1 diabetes 10 yo 2 weeks ago. high risk person house still give fuck. visited parents today high risk multiple reasons. 

So pissed. 

About 90% people regular grocery store wearing masks ..now city became hotspot. there's guess. Yeah, sure—but it’s Phase results. They’ve made treatment running trials it’s peer reviewed. doesn’t mean it’s effective. 

Do know many AIDS vaccines made Phase II Phase III twenty years ago? manufacturing yes, actual vaccine no. aka herd immunity need comically large saw cut Florida’s US virus clear months success places like Taiwan, Vietnam, New Zealand yet people power continually think best way deal least amount work possible.

They're pretending Trump real president. Instead practicing public health, come barely coherent excuses like ""well cases deaths down."" try negotiate scientists... Yeah state full selfish entitled pricks. God everything selfish assholes makes small amount empathy. Fucking hypocrits.  I'd guess runs ppl infect.  though? saying one wearing masks social distancing? life back normal stuff going on. incredibly naive think quarantine properly time. one knows far away vaccine is. Saying it’s least 5 yrs away also irresponsible. Also Mongolia Thailand.

Also hard / leaky border idea account Australia. Individual states closed borders prevent spread cases (this almost unheard of, done disobedience Prime Ministerial instructions). effective, example Western Australia case many weeks.

It said plainly: American response missed (ignored?) almost opportunities effective (edit: national-level) management pandemic, despite demonstrated effective elsewhere. Yes countries control they’re still facing restrictions close normal they’re normal. Im trying face possible reality get people’s thoughts. 
My point that, going way stop face lockdowns hope contain rest lives beyond available mean? Every single time article like comes people get excited, dig little deeper there’s little substance story. rehash article Telegraph 4 days ago. get snippets interview nothing ever defined. Timelines steps never mentioned, except available. putting lot expectations couple incredibly vague sentences. rollout plan? mentions prioritization health care workers that’s usually it. 

One sources said would go elderly first. Well, trials haven’t elderly subjects?

It seems good true. can’t explain why. Oxford seems credible, little crumbs details get public? Hopefully, proved wrong, get weird vibe this. There's lot going around country. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Yep. Denialists get hit waves mass death sooner later. forgot social workers too. hospitals ones responsible making sure discharged safe secure environment. thats england thought. wrc status changes every 100 years country charge fucks money badly. India ""going full USA"" way things going. Brazil time, October. Yea need go back insurance companies could deny coverage people disabilities, keeps prices low us healthy deserving people. Imagine many people life long covid effects getting insurance now, driving rates healthy people like us. Insurance people need least, like good old days Obama ruined it. Thanks Obama Well will. Herd immunity need initial goal though, even vaccine works 50% people smarter release vaccine 50% people removed pool spreaders adverse effects falling ill refining vaccine try hit herd immunity. Right goal minimize spread costs vaccine going that. Remember infection numbers soar election day.

He barely even legitimately won.  People downvoting truth. giving vs. teaching someone fish. Best prepared reality regardless. Well indiatvnews.com says so, must true mean sure, know what's it, dna rna vaccines relatively new field, exactly 0 rna vaccines approved use humans, really long term data rna vaccines. Could also make easier someone spot cheater.

Like, going? Nothing fun open. need anything store. work home. going? Governor Kemp basically worst governor entire country terms handling this.

No, used pieces. huge part Hilary getting nomination knew would easiest beat. Millions Americans hate women would never vote one cost, millions Americans hate Clinton’s. you’re running start even left gate.  don’t think trump working Stone long time, don’t think scandals planned distractions haven’t paying attention, mean, point can’t see he’s right going severely damage future political prospects (especially higher office), he’s even dumber “act” he’s putting on.

It’s like can’t said Trump either. He’s gone near sure-fire win November debatably trailing Biden, Biden hasn’t even fucking done anything. downvoted? Canadian man YouTube admitted Canadians say “aboat.” even showed clips Canadians saying it. feel like thing spread everywhere. understand looking appreciate it. reality virus contagious fact spread easily outdoors, x frequency, would likely impossible contact trace instance. 

Your best bet there’s peer reviewed study, case examples going give sort definitive answer. possible transmit outdoors (assuming close contact prolonged socializing considering), nobody going know that’s got it, came food, package, indoor air somewhere, ect. 

We pin point indoor transmission cases contact trace - usually restaurant names parties, usually larger outbreak, known symptomatic. 

How going ever find someone got jogger running them, group 20 ft away park happened perfectly downwind from?

We know it’s safe, little idea probability. 

I appreciate after. would require number studies simulation get anywhere close idea it. 

From day 1 6feet apart guidance kept 15 ft + apart long term socializing 10 ft quick hello. Viral load wind obviously play factor. 

But outside best going get order socialize without masks.  kind depends person. I’m anxious worrier nature, lot days make feel insurmountable. hell Navy going do? future reference others, timeline ""the worst"", look like? hospitalized within first 7-10 days?

Trump decided like masks republicans licking heels pretending wasn't/isn't raving idiot. made stuff ""freedom"" whatall ad hominem attacks political party's supporters not.

Meanwhile there's nothing abusive types love cry victim honestly called out, they're always enabled people understand ad hominem means.

An ad hominem fallacy disagreeing somebody politically criticizing behaviour, means can't build logical, technically-solid proof evidence insult, nobody even understands anymore, thinks means insult disagreement, misapplying term everywhere enabling whiny, bad faith actors. fucking get it, (US) life worth $8 million economy, hell supercapitalists running US saving MANY boatloads money paying people stay home longer dangerous meet others outside home? supercapitalists *really* think peons keep birthing new peons who'll grow able serve them, problem?

it's not.. hey.. studied inside vs out.

it's - studied moves around, does/not increase chance exposed.

Fuck can't say much Bangladesh, Pakistan testing enough all(neither India). Check worldometer data also local news channel geo____ something said decreasing testing. might case missing cases many people kill happy?  Hey, totally understand wanting give right now. Shit's _incredibly_ tough, really show signs getting better time soon. unfortunately, kids, get luxury giving up. got push bullshit them, still world grow in. still parents grow with, walk aisle decades help raise grandkids.

It sucks kind responsibility times like these. _really_ does. that's part deal.

And hey, know you. I'm saying would give up, maybe venting internet, everyone needs sometimes that's totally cool. sometimes need reminder point struggle is.

Remember, you. them, future. win. imagine awful world view believe medical professionals administrators conspiracies

These people truly hate people think everyone awful usual PSA: “I want know please wear mask... serious” let whole country 1.4 Billion coming total halt 2 months. settle living virus paying huge price tag upfront. 

Meanwhile, throwing towel without even seriously trying US quite perplexing me. find vaccine effective period time, occur sometime around January 20.  would like know protesting since say US election. whole world pretending virus, right? There’s little bit Florida Man us. people feel death toll isn’t bad economic fallout.

Stupid. Control virus, economy gets better. go hand-in-hand! time school season actual facts coming say will. bullshit get people actually go wish people US commenting understood more. Trashing New Yorkers Floridian behavior ignorant thinking things Sweden Spain. Texas New York might well different countries. Opening schools potential outcome healing people sick COVID19, whereas nurse risking life care COVID19+ person high probability healing said sick individual, thereby people supporting therapeutic environment hospital nursing home. 
This really basic Logic. I'd avoid Moderna you. number questionable practices including stock price manipulation. Yes. This. available, I'll happy there, especially groups particularly at-risk...but I'll waiting least make sure progressive research production they've utilized lead unintended issues. say someone 100% on-board vaccines. easy think terms numbers, die economy? like people pro-life get girlfriend pregnant, pro war Iraq kid getting deployed. Georgian here. us idiots. :/ friends appalled Kemp. Biden one gets announce take credit Trump call fake vaccine Twitter conspiracy theories it. People already spreading bill gates wants put tracker via vaccine This. illusion.  Consider shape double exponent.

Density may matter outbreaks small since need infection density, urban density, fast growth. infection density occurs, large cities may worst outcomes - gets point.

Japanese people staying home, that's changing. put much credence hand washing, masks seem like matter infection density thresholds crossed. Starting? Yes. golf course would ideal. even there? Ive there. actually better experience went LA crazy homeless tried kill me, time went SF couldnt walk 1 block without homeless asking money seeing shit floor.

Things cuba perfect, also bad all. people say medical advaces cuba non existent witnessed first hand, got spine saved thanks method developed cubans italians. 

So yeah, freedom police kill anytime get sick get bankrupt? Oh, thought asking source data published. sure September prediction 24 hours till first screaming Karen. Depends actual time symptom experience get tested. Basically dont get tested height symptoms, test positive. No, humidity tends saturate fomites, fall ground rather inhaled Totally is, though. can't think safer place put Soul Cycle!! 50 bikes tiny ass room... think actually Barbados recall. Chances confer least immunity, via antibodies, even catch body react much better. think especially helpful preventing severe cases. read expect first vaccine \~75% efficacy rate. would fantastic. That’s probably going next week, no? Yeh it’s right wing script  people like world eventually lot less people like world. Thank consideration. 

Collectively, things probably (I'm saying ""probably"" instead ""certainty"" uncharacteristic attempt optimistic life) going continue get worse US numbers continue spike across nation country continues doubt become polarized passing day heading towards November's election.  Next ... refrigerator trucks. doctors scientists could warned us this. know. I'd take warning story weigh 400 pounds. Enforce first, get people care second. people going act like children need treated like children. “I felt like risk kind peer group socialization bigger risk disease,” Weinstein said. “But feeling little bit differently.” 

It sucks people wait things like happen learn. Yeah infectious diseases always spike winter. I’m expert why. that’s “cold/flu season” 

People indoors next other, less sunlight/vitamin D, cold weaken immune systems. k took long? several people pointed out, could attract gofundme money conservatives. lockdowns US relatively ""soft"" compared Europe, probably less flatten curve. Kawasaki's seen NYC? I'm wondering ever confirmed Kawasaki's related European strain. Here's one line thinking:

* dangerous, need worry
* Okay dangerous, kills old people young people cannot get infected
* Okay young people get infected, cannot transmit adults like every disease send school
* Okay, transmitted adults, fomite washing hands need
* Okay, infectious, airborne need mask
* Okay, airborne get it, antibodies can't get let's herd immunity immunity passports
* Okay, antibodies persist longer 3-6 months, there's T-cell immunity
* Okay, [T-cells targeted killed but... Called statistics, mate. Texas also 6,400 pneumonia flu deaths year -- total covid deaths. 


This sudden surge pneumonia flu deaths far higher annual averages, quite steady. 

Wonder there's many pneumonia flu deaths year...quite bizarre... Basically cold states get stuck inside, flu colds going around making people sick add virus that. Yea hit again, weakened. spread schools like forest fire fully reopen. Ok, Thailand. Less 3500 cases 58 deaths. island bordering Laos, Myanmar, Cambodia Malaysia. 10k visitors Wuhan Chinese New Year January. close borders lock March lock fairly strict mask usage 90%+ (in Bangkok anyway). Masks still mandatory malls, shops public transport. Everything open things 8 weeks. community transmission 50+ days. ""On brink"" really means ""we needed one two weeks ago"" due lag. oMg CiViL RiGhTs. /s. sure hope true. told since covid RNA virus vaccine. Would like know thoughts redditors medical science fields this. top priority kids go school learn science solve pandemic all! /s Well recent cluster US base Okinawa, south Japan. Hong Kong, pretty much failure/reluctance tough western tourists/staff quarantine properly. Incredible. I'm glad geniuses exist. words, like Japan considered rude eat drink walking - pandemic not. Tokyo Disney safely open considered foolhardy Disney World 

Common courtesies one thing Japan often gets right countries don't. husband emergency visit ENT 6 weeks ago told doctor wearing large scuba looking goggles, mask shield well gloves protective gown.

Some places really gearing up. shame can't count PPE reliable everywhere need US. Maybe fall damage increased covid 19 update. Could bug system fixed next climate change update. Sincere questions. vaccine developed yet scientists don’t know reinfection possible durable immunity is? working vaccine like polio like influenza? No, didn't. Keep trying. still sure ADE.

It could well bad outcomes resulted catching one serotype even noticing, followed catching another serotype later. Recent studies continue hint possibility.

With exponential growth, severity may lag first infection that's exponential need month two mixing steep slope leads bad outcomes. Trillion dollar question - answer unclear yet. Statistically mostly true. get it, yes, rarely serious. go! least know idiots, attended, same. Well, everyone get take chances rest us protected. least long vaccine effective. news Canada get it? pre-buy doses? obviously knows something don’t. don’t think fears elected like politicians. definitely ain’t good.

Thanks. everyone's going rush take tested thoroughly. Smart. 6 weeks first round trials Oxford vaccine developed cannibalistic instincts, super speed. attacking family members, they, too, developed traits within 24 hours.

I kid, really hope vaccine works out, man, ended resulting full blown zombie apocalypse type scenario even fucking surprised considering year's gone far. know Oxford vaccine provide long term immunity? What’s long term you? 6 months? year? can’t possibly know yet long vaccine provide antibodies unless receipts vaccine working weeks. way feel right exactly every non-pilot air force feels 😂 Coronaviruspreventionnetwork.com Thanks, great answer!

People keep flipping dozen different contradictory conspiracies. 'just flu' also 'horrible attack China' also 'liberal hoax' also 'communist muzzles' also 'Bill Gates trackers' course '5G towers.' 

I wish one two narratives. could try cope somehow. can't get halfway unpacking another one takes over.  mean, New York still 8-9% fatality rate, Spanish flu like 3%. balance things realize Florida, Texas, Arizona, California, Alabama, Mississippi, whole bunch states skyrocketing cases - don’t know.

Singapore handled pandemic like boss 12 deaths. Wear fuckin mask, quit actin like Cory Trevor I'm not. particular side can't named science literally decades. Look platforms past 40 years pretty much see look science says choose opposite. many cases hospitals completely overwhelmed IFR rise due lack care. Since stopped flu shot... yet get flu. get flu shot flu. know everyone different. seriously reluctant vaccine. FL:

Between rock hard place: want people get sick die, I'm also lose everything close again.

I'm scared many varied levels. dream died night, instead panic felt relief. ""I guess worry anymore."" increase testing capacity positive rate increased? healthcare based profit model, get. 

actually government handle healthcare creates incentive ensure people get sick. people get sick, hospitals medical supplies use cost government ultiimately taxpayers money. inheritors would demand populous healthier. 

when go profit model, incentive get people sick possible point might die. safe vaccine shouldn’t create flu like symptoms big majority takers. It’s shit vaccine. October roll means select get it. we’re long way enough vaccinated people herd immunity. Billions doses don’t instantly come existence, even early aggressive prep work we’re looking middle next year real meaningful effect vaccine. kids exponential growth...it’s lot scarier you’re seeing happen real life learning stats/bio  I'm skeptical...I seen outlet. figured would big news even send stocks absolutely insane amount injected directly lungs, recall correctly.

Letting virus infect people tempting fate. blue death come back. people even wear masks, makes think they'll get vaccinated? nowhere South Korea really control

Taiwan Hong Kong handled even better South Korea though?

Fuck McConnell denying Newsom funding keep California shut longer, &amp; fuck Newsom bending ""REOPEN NOW!"" idiots &amp; reopening MUCH soon instead trying harder get funds keep California shut long enough cases plummet.

That's Covid thing, that's every-virus-since-forever thing. fully expect almost every nation planet ban Americans distant future. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* solution would expand testing January/February (specifically community spread), impose strict mask policies, shutdown anything spread could contained everything possible keep rest economy going. Even now, need strict mask policies places uncontrolled spread need lockdown contact tracing feasible. none things left two losing options. 

Also, I'm financial help. think government forces people shutdown, responsible keeping afloat. problem UI equivalent US average engineer's salary. Many people making 2x-3x working, insane. financial stability country that, along future generations paying it.

But general point problem much complicated printing money passing bill. US already trouble pre-COVID. Get hotel take vacation. Even 10 minutes away. explain health relationship. irony small government conservatives. people usually get tested admitted hospital? test required somebody died? Genuinely asking impression diagnosis covid death enough, could obviously wrong. Number deaths suspiciously low weekend. typically lower weekend, 418 suspect. surprised deaths stay 500 week start slowly decrease rest month along new cases.  would sacrifice countless lives make sure Republicans lose? Even might end life? many lives could saved offered out? 0.5% IFR outside nursing homes 70% population infected would 1.1 million non-nursing-home deaths. go hear this? Ughhh. embarrassing.  Unfortunately, pharmacies high quality guarantee. long went customs FDA approval, it'll bought sold

A lot Chinese manufacturers fake FDA &amp; CE certifications well fake lab reports approved stocks low standards  already stop posturing.

The wheels politics move slowly. That's design. Releasing statements public softens people incoming news. There's also logistical work done behind scenes keep everything board. government employees work 9-5 lunch breaks coffee breaks. getting paperwork order exactly like running relay race. Short answer: Get ready someone claim credit. intentionally avoided watching it, suppose now. go fuck 50 bucks, yall somehow seem see guys highest number covid deaths, yet yall continue think trump right COVID little flu.

NYTimes reported US Phase 3 starts August. Likely announced tomorrow along Phase 1 data - Moderna reported results announced Phase 3 start day (July 27, week tomorrow).

Of course, expect trial sites focused American Sun Belt. Nailed it. Remember end, Hitler killed himself, ordered destruction punishment German people failing him. 
This seems trajectory dear leader on. Thanks info! know existing vaccine used? What? get from? news channel india, blog. Classic rich scum. Politics disgusting... !remindme 2 days  frequently used medical PPE surgeries patients serious infectious diseases (e.g. AIDS) protect surgeons contaminated blood splatter eyes mouth? take it. rushed development, likely gene-based conventional vaccine injected body inserts select pieces virus cells near injection site. immune system recognizes molecules pieces, called antigens, threats reacts making antibodies, molecules find virus anywhere body neutralize it. dress rehearsal happens, immune system remembers quash invaders, stop future established approach grow weakened viruses chicken eggs—or recently mammalian insect cells—and extract desired pieces. process take four six months get right antigens familiar viruses change every year, influenza. take multiple attempts years new germ. far slow combat virus already spread pandemic labs turning gene-based vaccines. Scientists use information genome virus create blueprint select antigens. blueprint made DNA RNA—molecules hold genetic instructions. researchers inject DNA RNA human cells. cell’s machinery uses instructions make virus antigens immune system reacts to. Cells respond instructions normal part daily existence. trait infectious viruses exploit; cannot reproduce own, use cell’s machinery make copies themselves. burst cell infect cells, widening allow foreign DNA instructions cells god knows what. much trust put this? I’d love take it’s kinda scary. get flu shot time, seems sketchy. think oversimplifying happiness. every second Disney movie bliss.

Also, get divorced happy relationship? [tell social distance wear mask happen know? birthday also day life started ending. cannot continue ... won’t.

I think lockdowns inevitable too. sadly longer wait mores strict damaging be. Along many deaths.

To “save economy” leaders destroyed it. Tell conscientious companies support them! They're getting ear ""noisy antimaskers"" time. *They need hear* support right thing.

A clerk local pharmacy told manager forbade wearing face masks would ""scare customers"". told scares don't! Eventually PPE came (thank God), gradually precautions slipping again. keep reinforcing message, magical thinking powerful people want pretend danger gone away. same, apparently? four five Covid19 ones seem matter, vaccine works making unable use little hooks attach, something. may also work (some) cold viruses, side effect, maybe. Big brush.

And problems still stand. fund trillions develop pay quarterly needles avoid catching cold? pressures. Moderna? Also only, f mindset vaccines typically take 5 years produce, shaved 52 months 10 There's law, lol, state mandate hardly enforced Maybe virus thinned herd anti mask karens. bright side looks like hospitalization went slightly Absolutely. 

But capable ""smart thing"" US, mess right now. also you. Europe/America? Quickly.  good way put it. then, question would really get it? know would accept vaccine anytime soon. believe there’s larger amount people would refuse accept it. even talking legend prophecy manifests think would good thing died, like him, sucks know would happen seems little scary (not scary already). option stay home deal it? break leg something? Unsavory white code black people. That’s they’re pushing media saying it’s “gang members” easy claim source citation. quick search Lancet ""ChAdOx1 nCoV-19"" results whopping 2 articles, published back May. Exactly. People gonna rude awakening find won’t distributed like movies hear flu vaccination isn’t worth getting? found covid 19 cause clotting....which mitigated blood thinners recovery. Thanks. googled mostly seems sketchy sources... Change mind, want true gag order? Wtf good would even do? tell can’t talk it? Ooooh bet she’s scrrrd Right, relationship overall adding joy happiness life, would leave it? one point, liked relationship enough get married. 

This absolute. someone happy, ever second, general, would want divorce? See guys side.  let fire burn, it'll burn there's nothing left burn. Fellow TN! family wears masks stays home whenever possible. trying! Dude working mail means handed coffee whatever else use stay awake food too. Y’all work day n night get things places that’s real important live mandate. Private entities mandating masks lower risks.

I continue wear one many masks avoid closed spaces masks can't used. Italy scads low-caste Chinese guest workers. enables Italian manufacturers sell cheap goods still claim ""made Italy."" Exactly. Normality returned major pandemics. think one different obtuse thinking absurd. Lmao love they're going Santa Monica South Bay. big shit show.  Pediatricians urge parents send kids back far apart we, wearing masks, indoors outdoors? becomes logistical educational campaign point. say educational would get people take vaccine get ""booster"" regularly. Honestly, think start giving immunization cards (or infamous * gasp * chips) whether immunity need go certain locations, quasi-involuntary program. Right 70% US said would get vaccine available enough herd immunity. every couple months (and lets real, probably pay since US) rate going much lower. would get herd immunity. Denmark (where I'm from) schools opened one first. requirement people (mainly women) chance work home. understand become contested topic USA. want people work home, open schools.

&amp;#x200B;

The south particular hard hit. Look death numbers, somewhat trustworthy number. New York, New Jersey, North-East USA general basket case league. People say Sweden horrible, meanwhile New Jersey &amp; New York three times many deaths per million Sweden. Sweden admitted failed protecting elder care homes, De Blasio deliberately put sick people elder care homes. Stop shaking hands. family Florida mother tested positive Covid-19. crying freaking out. Jo Jorgensen ^-^ Kokomo Indiana.

It's shithole. Stay away Kokomo things go bad enough expect Disney something try improve image Sheesh 2018-2019 flu season mortality rate America estimated 34,200 deaths. year 61,000. even assume half numbers COVID19 fabricated (which big/stupid assumption), it’s still lot worse flu way shorter amount time. despite COVID19 related lockdowns, numbers still manage climb.

In short: don’t know you’re talking about. yikes think politics,crazy people ""radical left"" lol.....


I guess we're forgetting COINTELPRO thing 100k Bust!

/s quite sure USA ""do enter"" list every country now. Sounds aboot right  indiatv, seems legit Rest Peace good human. miss Don’t worry, ems week back soon enough fellow ambulance driver! see. There's plenty shills working pretend otherwise. We’ve got promising leads produce antibodies—now IgG antibodies, even T-cell antibodies. I’m looking forwards reading actual __*data*__ tomorrow AstraZeneca Oxford trials. 

Still, vaccine candidates long way go. entering phase II, phase II/phase III combined trials prove efficacy. come long way medicine last 100 years, can’t remember time since AIDS epidemic societal push everyone involved act quickly order get results today, yesterday. Nevertheless, stomach turns hear people say likely working vaccine ready deployment September. 

There many unknowns, many people don’t understand hurdles clinical trials even specific hurdles exist. think it’s time remain cautiously optimistic, hope something effectively fight illness soon. 

I simply tired seeing stocks soar updates mean nothing anyone laymen passive observers. honestly concerns taking something pushed Phase II/III eight weeks mass produced entire world population.

I’m glad people like volunteering, happy hear adverse reactions minimal. pray treatment turns effective never deal full blown effect virus.  sure answer this. can’t provide evidence anyone performing precautions. 

Those guidelines / rules entry posted website app. presented Orange County approval open. Advent health running health checks. 

So share guidelines compare someone like Target Home Depot. thing, can’t provide evidence well run things. 

There plenty vloggers video going checks. Personally, like Tim Tracker since doesn’t seem hype sensationalize anything. countless others watch range Disney wrong Disney nothing right. 


Here month ago requirement loops / ties masks. Tim able demo checks day early video shows “sold out” magic kingdom looks like. Cambodia one countries zero deaths. hope spark new outbreak. Vietnam, Cambodia Laos together zero deaths! damn dream. kids? cause do, school opening soon shit worst. agree lot goverment done, specially quickly things moved strict lockdown, goverment's credit, always extremely clear things would like people careful, seeing clear result that, exactly warned since beggining. Yeah unlikely kids teens. Good know. eyes years neighbor wife, stalker level, tho :) Two days doesn’t constitute trend. three times last month. direction graph doesn’t really matter folks today’s SIXTY-FIVE THOUSAND new cases. understand many people 65,000 is? ...It’s 65,000! Im sure google it, logic, explained based knowing tests work. You’re swabbing area looking see virus present. It’s relatively easy miss something presents us technique, small amount virus, test/lab failure, aside contamination generally you’re going detect something exist. Hey guys, 


I business would like provide Drive Thru Cashiers n95 Kn95 masks. already purchased provided face shields + cloth masks since March would like provide efficient masks keep safe. 


My question place purchase bulk. many times consecutive days mask used? seeing 10 packs thinking purchasing 1 pack per employee use month. many need get make sure safe? need use different mask everyday? Guess isn’t idiots US Gald hear. Best luck. There's great story someone touring NASA facility asked janitor job replied ""I'm putting man moon"". uhhh.  sucks..everything watch news talks Fl.. north FL im happy this. mask get fully 4 months uhh Thanks responding! AZN already took pretty solid boost end past week. Thank you! There's lag infection symptoms. lag symptoms someone gets tested. lag testing gets reported (both testee state). lag symptoms hospitalization. lag hospitalizations death. there's lag death getting paperwork signed reported.

So, there's lag, hell knows long. care picks  lot people need explained them, dork Slavery big deal republicans. I'm bartender, many co-workers got sick February/March well, deathly ill.

I experienced additional side effects hope again, still mask though. I'd take antibodies test accurate point feel like might wasting time 4 months on. capitalism best.....  incentives capitalism provides supposed produce better outcome form economic policy.  failing now? watched understand couple reasonably intelligent relatives went anti-mask tangent.

I beyond pissed end it.

Prepare yourself. us bots gonna agian  waaaaay overestimating many people willing take initially. Yeah confederates took back running state past 140 years. Please! Save Halloween!  Well, realistic limitation. current production rate might take us 2 years make enough syringes, build production lines pump [out tens thousands hour. ] hard make billion 1 use syringes 2020 honestly. Don’t let science stand way opening schools! /s literally dozens people asking probably many answers scroll down. Short answer already developing vaccine another coronavirus years tweaked it, essentially years head start. media really cover this. Jesus wouldn’t want get sick.

This collection plate. sad.... flu vaccine works 100% time strains target 

Oh heck no. lucky reaches 60% targeted 37% effective influenza A(H1N1)pdm09...”

“.... current influenza vaccine 45% effective overall 2019-2020 seasonal influenza B viruses...”

“... vaccine effective typically season offers decent match circulating influenza antigens...”

Here additional complication: least 2 different “strengths” flu vaccine, give stronger one old people invoke response. let’s say miss cut age 3 days - get weaker flu vaccine, let’s say don’t average immune system, wrong vaccine!!

One curious things obsessed (and doctor able answer far) happens get flu vaccine, wait 1 month, get vaccinated again? A) die overdose, B) statistical effect, C) statistically protected?

Before guess “B” please realize many, many, many vaccines given multiple doses wait exactly “C”. Look hepatitis vaccines example, many! nobody tell flu vaccine like that. family York county parties since April currently North Carolina. dont eveny seemingly taking seriously there. spike feel good footthis disease? gave someone else,and person got really sick? sympathize concerns. I'm worried family's health. blunt,this you. schools open, peoplewill get sick. die. Got utility sink washer/dryer? camping toilet inflatable mattress sounds like plan. Two weeks.

I don’t get it. Maybe people cavalier mostly spent time people dying slowly painfully something hospitals?

I have, made much respectful anything possible avoid family friends.

I swear, it’s like “Yeah Trudy died covid, kid’s college, sucks, liked working past ten years. go AnnaBeth’s baby shower. think Trudy caught me? wasn’t sick. six people twelve baby shower caught it. mean shared office day never went anywhere ever maybe caught gas station Amazon box.” Well tell there’s veiled intent desire optimism, strong belief official narrative always open questioning. belief reinforced people get bent shape. hear there’s place called Kokomo. That’s want go get away all. evidence showing rising confirmed cases restaurant/bar workers? given masks technically don’t protect others spreading virus everyone eating drinking mask off, I’m wondering workers would significantly exposed therefore highly likely contract virus. first one! New national motto: Sacrifice thee, me. hear there’s place called Kokomo. That’s want go get away all. Meh. better 5 years ago. sad died know gag order affects mandate, private right free speech, right? Yes.

Does mean among standard vaccines people get (measles, polio, etc.), even 70% effective? KY attorney general suing stop face mask executive orders. Oh gooood yesssss feel like vaccines way forward. way keep social distancing staying sane. **That's places try find/borrow money give people shutdown!** don’t see point argument. bubonic plague slowed Europe’s development centuries. economy society built right it’s highly fragile sensible sudden population changes, life know right can’t survive 1918 pandemic less say bubonic plague. ultimately, don’t want people die avoid it. Another week two later, articles ""Church goer dies Covid, one saw coming"" Fyi, everytime someone uses phrase one less person wears mask.

There people idiots others actually concerned freedoms, serious concern today. everyone forget army called state capitols month half ago quell civilians? Oh wow, um, pretty much exactly those. Mix bunch oatmeal bagels that's diet past half year.

Goodnight Texas mask mandate Ya saying healthcare workers would help, whole “doctors nurses!” thing kind leaves everyone else who’s involved treating patients. Maybe I’m selfish, firefighter/EMT physically go pick up/care multiple covid patients shift homes minimal PPE often cluttered, cramped, absolutely sterile environments, sure would love get vaccine ASAP don’t pass family That's great. non-American. Please leave crazy divisive politics behind. want riots street people getting fired cancelled saying wrong words. Yah realize ESPN majority owned Disney makes sense lol ""My part go ER, go hospital, I'm going wait get approval go,"" told news outlet. Linscott noted agree notify health department intentions leave home reason.

I may side couple one. want agree wait needed ER room. many people leaving hospital sudden onset diabetes? !remindme 1 day oh let's this. ""wearing mask help"" argument.

Wear both, especially essential workers/restaurant workers. many us, releasing initial fears living normal life *is* progress.
 
There absolute chaos beginning. NYC fucking disaster, especially insanely stupid nursing home stunt. didnt know immunity possible. death rate looked horrendous.
 
Now know virus manageable. death rate minimal. handle toll flu, hurt, handle this. American people conditioned believe use tax dollars directly benefits emergencies beyond control charitable favor really deserve emergency circumstances somehow fault, funneling billions billionaires saving economy. voters don’t masks... they’re likely vaccine. Also.... shhh. Don’t give ideas. provide desks chairs, assume kids parent car (with AC) run whole school day? already targeting 400million doses Europe end year. 

Production also bit controversial concerns producing USA belief trump would seize vaccines ordered Europe guven opportunity. **suf·frage**
/ˈsəfrij/ 

noun right vote political elections. much difference, covid patients. Yes. Also far bed usages, surgeries, sickness general, accidents, still electives etc. Boca barely busier year ago always operate high capacity non pandemic summer. hospital actually expanded ICU another floor/wing durring flu season (remember Flu specifically respiratory illness whole). last part key, number hospitals here, yet panic media agenda that, even Delray did. 

Shitload testing though, like overwhelming amounts testing over, sites hospitals.

Some smaller ones packed, difference flu even regular season hospitals operate 90%+ normally. They'll offload regional hospitals capability also contingency plans expand ICU usage came that

The two wives street Broward ICU covid wings. Busy, bad think. Back normal hours vs Feb - May time frame including day like Friday like this. given ""record"" numbers interesting. According media agenda makes seem like going die stepping foot outside, bodies dropping dead left right streets. Given thousand thousands ""new cases"" daily, media would think 170% over. Two Cousins Denver ER less busy well.

Don't get wrong people dying sick, anyone denies moron, numbers make sense. given bs coming cases counted mistakes, makes sense. Heck motorcyclist killed got put covid death lol, caused massive backlash media fueled hatred covid reported. I'm sure lot investigations next 12-24 months. UK vaccine, aint getting credit. mean enough resources, research, need, could find cure coronaviruses well? Like common cold?

&amp;#x200B;

edit: downvotes? people sub bitter odd. right can't move Canada God Jehovah heal them..in Jesus name.. Amen Living state significant amount mask resistance, think would help lot guys came said “Yeah, fucked told everyone wear masks February March.” People google said aren’t buying “those outdated statements.” Except technically that's true AIDS. even technically true covid. Plz. America fucking tanking rn cause nobody wear fucking mask wish kept Twitter account. suffered disease, watch someone love suffer, put lives line treating people wanted see dragged.

This joke. Covid real. Stupid people like called out. I’m too. Unfortunately I’ve worked whole pandemic I’m everything else stay safe. Masking everywhere, dining out, distancing, etc Some, assume, good people Teacher too. *Hugs* #WATER WET classic ""football fields"", let's assume:

- avg human 5ft tall, 16in wide
- football field 300x160ft

Then 1 football field would 7,200 human.

COVID deaths America would almost 20 football fields.

If (hopefully don't) reach 216,000 deaths, could fill every NFL stadium. Joe take note, he’s got perfect running mate right ""the smart thing"" lol heading? thought many times leaving US teacher many places go get compensation except maybe Canada apply accepted teacher I'm sure there's great enough need area Spanish. *Hopefully countries similar access vaccine, too* 

As someone another country - thanks saying &lt;3 Lol, wow already ramping production start mass vaccination approved. phase 3 trails end turning shitshow eat loss. American northern Italy here! perhaps answer based differences I’ve seen two approaches. 

First off, lockdown response centralized government. half-measures taken, strict, true quarantine whole country (even areas without surge cases). could go necessities (food meds). couldn’t really even drive anywhere hell it, moving outside area forbidden. 

Second, least area areas hit badly virus, masks obligatory (even outside) weeks month first reopened. Nobody really fought since still scared getting sick, think obligatory nature initial mask decree helped lots people get used idea wearing mask, people still wearing public, indoor spaces like supermarkets shops. 

Also, public places allowed turn AC summer there’s worry spreads way. all, lots measures still taken terms prevention. 

Third, I’m basing Italian nurse friend said, response hospital handled unified fashion. health care system public, made easier say, “ok, hospital *just* Covid19 patients, we’ll attempt leave hospital strictly emergencies”. instance, hospital road Covid19 care months now, larger hospital near handling emergencies. 

Fourth, practically speaking, us living most-affected urban areas pretty much know someone virus now. saw ambulances passing two eyes, we’ve people telling us it’s like firsthand. think lot family friends back US live outside NY still haven’t affected personally, think plays part. 

Sorry novel. I’ve thinking question lot last month, that’s I’ve mostly determined. 

TLDR: listened damn science, followed centralized government response, true quarantine, wore masks lol someone major depression ocd, really feel you. children boot, hands literally bleeding I’ve washing much. 

We though. Hang bud. think child old enough make decisions. Guess dad 79 years old, hopefully child smarter. FUckers We're uncontrolled pandemic.

Then boost income every american making less 950.00 bucks per week. They're living pandemic,and many working. they'll blame China care much virus older generations care climate change social justice. say like major slap face died lost loved one covid , makes feel sick angry . 25 active cases case people refusing vaccine around century vs people refusing brand new vaccine. unreasonable people refuse covid vaccine first comes safety fears, especially since seen past new vaccines affecting certain populations terrible ways first come due lack testing diversity. case easily challenged court considered something new settled law.

I know I'm planning even looking vaccine several months due consider rush job it. I'm happy I'm privileged enough move anywhere see fit long enough see through. perks remote job passport. nice rebuttal facts sad man baby herd immunity basically reopened. “We can’t mandate masks, that’s unconstitutional. Also, government would like censor speech.” Could go direction well. Give mobile population Understand cares businesses. presidents put businesses blind trust. wants people travelling vacationing he's losing money. right thing beginning would cost money short run it. he's stupid realize going kill business long run. that's US crony capitalism federal level. Short term profits long term health economy. See also climate change. number dead pretty high State low population density.

Compare part Japan number people, 100 times densly populated 0 death due fact everyone wearing face mask time. stay in. think leaving. Here's article lady getting hit bus. 

Wear mask aware stay safe spread fear. Shit happen norm. Guess Who, Canadians! Although keeps American women… town Bergamo, according antibody testing around 60% people it, probably herd immunity, rest country definitely doesn't. Due lockdown restrictive measures number active cases went low enough risk spread relatively low. course still need vaccine. _NEVER_ go full USA That's fair makes sense. Thank ICONIC!! WIG!! VACCINATE BABY Today 23k. Sunday numbers lower. Brazil seems peaked time ago, slowly trending down. girl die awaiting double lung active T-cell keep us getting sick COVID-19 mutates? relapses mutated COVID-19? strain still reinfects people? Yeah no. work logistics assure millions syringes waiting used. ramped production  tired brought everyone debating wrong. truth is, law niqab unnecessary since already law stating can’t mask face public need identifiable. political handle pure bs result debates created (and apparently continues create) bs too. 

The right respond would :
« For safety reasons, law requires identifiable public, result face covering goes law. making new law don’t need one going make big deal. religion, new. respect law » 

Then everyone shuts goes lives. would asymptotic people also vaccinated? wonder long it’d take get uk vaccinated? reason happening kids home need supervision. means parents home. Parents home watch kids means less productivity, even work home all. Less productivity less jobs = Weak economy. 

It's election year. can't that.

Yes. literally die economy situation. #WATER WET   mean toddlers spread it? Sorry poorly said. Early stopping refers efficacy assessment. Right two years follow planned (though second year limited) safety durability assessment. Lol you’re trying paint someone supports trump. case. Youre extremely pro Fauci think that’s it’s partisan talking point. hope learn Democrats infallible held high standard, even believe republicans don’t same. 

He didn’t say “masks unnecessary lockdown”, guess that’s put parentheses lol. said there’s need person healthcare field walking around mask. wrong. 

I don’t want demonize Fauci all, don’t support government officials lying public. all. Hope come around issue day. assuming vaccine even worm every non Anti vax person get it. That’s simply true Don’t forget us EMS/pre-hospital care!!!  Thank GOODNESS  read phone mom. Plz true. want thing ASAP. many older family members every day feel like I'm going crazy stress. Yeah, really misstated that. meant trials successful, hands deck, ramped production even more. wish clear information trials production. bishop weeks ago. seems like generally conservative town. Everyone masks though. aren’t already? Hell yeah brother. Roll Tide! /s catch-22 crap right there. Ding ding ding.

Keep base concerned virus come vote November, keep lib's staying home. Block discredit vote-by-mail. Win landslide. Sure, good chunk base probably die, matter second term.

Let’s dispel fiction ~~Barack Obama~~ Donald Trump doesn’t know he’s doing. knows exactly he’s doing. exclude fact got bad many countries despite strict extended lockdown. never lock-down 'unamed' flu. Imagine situation Europe like USA (way less strict lock-down) worse. would experienced way deaths.

Countries never many deaths never many infections either. mean virus infectious, rather countries took right measures prevent spread (which dont flu). barely pay bills add often add credit card balance use schools child care week.  ""...it’s people, it’s money."" ~Steven Mnuchin Fair enough. remarking general response sort good news. types masks provided much higher degree exposure protection inward transmission particles, preventing outward transmission

That exact opposite results knowledge date regarding surgical homemade masks - needs extraordinary evidence. N95 masks, sure, notice doctors nurses dealing serious infectious diseases wear N95s, surgical masks (when supplies). almost nobody access N95 masks wearing public.

You cannot take single study like this. Obamacare approved vaccines free patient. insurance, probably medicaid pay provider, like testing. EDIT Heroes act coming soon includes free vaccines uninsured. second last paragraph comment u/Temstar, also gave number current number isolated asymptomatic carriers. report situation asymptomatic carriers become confirm case total carriers medical provinces (including autonomous regions direct-administered municipalities) Xinjiang Production Construction Corps report 13 new asymptomatic carriers (4 imported). **1 new asymptomatic carrier became confirmed case yesterday** (1 imported), 5 released isolation recovered (3 imported). **Currently 154 asymptomatic carriers** medical isolation (87 imported).

If asymptomatic carriers showing symptom, [the day (18th) report (19th) provinces (including autonomous regions direct-administered municipalities) Xinjiang Production Construction Corps report 42 new asymptomatic carriers (12 imported). **No new asymptomatic carrier became confirmed case yesterday**, 4 released isolation recovered (2 imported). **Currently 147 asymptomatic carriers** medical isolation (87 imported). 

So 147 Saturday. +13 new, -1 confirmed, -5 recovered; 147+13-1-5 = 154.

I remember reddittors accused China lowering case categorised infected asymptomatic carriers separated actual case. actually like it. Asymptomatic carriers require isolation critical care. give clear picture resources require manage pandemic. Also, rooms ventilated frequently leaving windows open. schools plexiglass mounted front student desks.

I northern Japan, since February university library opening windows 30 minutes every 2-3 hours, even snow.

Japan lot little things curb spread, measures add significant impact. That's doctors started wearing surgery 100 years ago.

That's normally surgery doctors nurses examine talk patients without wearing masks. surgery scrubbed in, wearing head toe protective gear. infect patient.

Anyone who's watched war movies TV shows doctors know doctors nurses wear masks operating wounded patients. doctors nurses worried catching bullet shrapnel injured soldier, worried infecting soldiers open wound. Even soldier taken bath changed clothes days found laying muddy ditch. next scene may doctors sitting cot recovering soldier, mask sight. shit, whole fucking country needs close School also place people learn socialize, best done large setting lots different medium sized settings.

I’m worried eventual second wave we’ll quash, bad first time hospitalizations deaths, I’m worried travelers bringing cases back worse hit areas competent governor helps lot.  would watch Pay-Per-View.

""They fucked up, sure!"" Thanks doc Makes sense. personally know several people moved city purely needed / people around. Living city + able go probably worst. see something looks little like popping Facebook feed:

. 

""they're injecting us virus built foreign research lab. scientists even said virus recombine things. Whatever want said. means whatever Leftist Elites funded George Soros want, like 5G microchips designed Bill Gates. awake yet?!

They're going collaborate Mainstream Fake News Media run Hillary Clinton make use afraid 'pandemic' (that 99.97% people get sick from) we'll let government force us get 'vaccines' sneak man made recombined microchip-viruses bodies. They're trying turn us walking 5G towers turn whenever want. believe me? call pandemic ancient Greek means pan + demos. That's + people English. Lefist Elites bold scientists telling us plan right eyes. trying trick us tell us disease affects people, everyone's gotta get microchip-virus injection. way take control everyone time.

DON'T worry though! One thing Anti-God Liberals realize true freedom loving Americans NEVER allow put demon 5G machines bodies bodies children!!!!!!""

 America themed emojis added liberally throughout text. That’s papers said that’s interpreted it? bit shit government fucking joke imagine scientists run place fucking kill nan tories stay inside quite lot. 3000 cases Paris suburbs, pretty safe come mask.

Stop living bubble, check infection rates : sure Europe got hit hard first wave, wisdom learn mistakes.

The USA hand... guys fucked. I'm sorry minority smart people country. Yep. Schools closed. Still reasonable studies different groups transmit virus  media busy politicizing ""masks vs. masks"" instead job helping people learn truth global catastrophe. will. governor keeps press conferences shows US map red areas high infection rates uses incorrect data make Arizona look bad Texas Florida. Shit hit fan yet prefer Coronazona Lol remind me. live texas yes correct. Im stating massive population people uneducated well outcome. yes republican party cause persistent problem. still people. sign poor education usa part. hope gets better notice experience people set thier narrow minded ideas. follow anyone agrees Lets fight covid accusing public health officials conspiring populace absolutely evidence whatsoever! sure entire world knew end March. point pandemic full swing multiple European countries NY surrounding states reeling well. ... Sweden still trying get Herd Immunity: Forest School sounds really cool. wonder Coastal Schools thing. concept coast. I'd go that, lol. Cool, thank you! hardest things outbreak feeling never end. makes want give doomed part lives forever even try? let people die?

I want point feeling 100% caused *this subreddit*.

If subreddit obsessively posting every outbreak focusing almost entirely outlying, 1 50,000 cases, one would worried are, really deadly maiming /r/coronavirus claims hourly basis. Winner winner chicken dinner. Here's arm. Shoot up! families I've known took jobs Apple Amazon, we're talking good doubling tripling exchange rates taken account. Big tech good healthcare sacrificing much moving. also work home probably 2021 they're risk themselves. America like, “WE NEED TRAIN IMMUNE SYSTEMS NATURALLY EATING BORGERS” lidl October, due Covid19 course useless federal government going allow landlords start evicting mass. ""I must evict need pay mortgage"" *If gone going paying you?*

Although looks like great time renting realistate even shitty rental costs 30K buy probably easy rent due fact people go anywhere can. mean test ccp determines result? Hmm, thanks. There's cap 100k salary (yearly, 8 weeks portion 100k) PPP funds used iirc That’s happens bookings drop 5% normal. They’ve since slowly creeped plateaued 25-30% range. 

Those layoffs would happened months ago payroll grants. Funny, doctors complaining many non-coronavirus patients got infected coronavirus patients first came Italy. difficult separate quickly enough staff spreading themselves. mind stopped going USA, honestly deserve patronage services offered countries handling epidemic better Treatment losers.

Real men let organs spill streets like god intended. Almost wish haha nope I'm working home introvert 😁 dog thing weird understand wanting work home children. next impossible get anything done full time baby sitter work full time.

That said, bad, pandemic control. They're saying unfroze research infected somehow, one miners already Patient Zero: current SARS-CoV-2. would died naturally without *attempt* research, without whatever planned tried do. authors never claim even imply needed lab adulteration virus cause pandemic. people didn’t A/C thousands years didn’t die Thank correction! CEO Lawrence Gelman also climate change denier.  Drinking bleach trials conducted South US earlier year promising results, unless making people really sick considered downside. Snorting whole mess crushed hydroxychloriquine letting big whoop declaring virus hoax also may beneficial effects one political parties. *Badum Tss* one vote America address? Seeing oxford post top reddit feed one best things experienced almost 18 years living. Really gives hope wonder every comment seems blo-cked m0d Still going okay? Wear mask. don’t think unfair point; I’m sure else they’re supposed do. 14,000 kids isn’t lot tell parents kids end statistic absorb sending kid school person something told even though people knew many kids would die.

Then see amount little lives destroyed. kids going school means going place fed safe. kids whose parents can’t work remotely, make sure homework? child 5? 

The think it, sincerely don’t judge either view point anymore kind accept stuff going SUCK really, really hard people die people go barely paying bills begging section 8 housing.

I think point reasonable people, despite whatever side isle lean toward, willing admit people USA failed general. might survive, underground bunkers sound like luxurious lifestyle, especially considering used to.  Also, global economy, major trading partners shut down, economy feel effects well. Plus US’s economy takes lot tourism. many tourists going visiting US.

When Toronto SARs cases, entertainment industry restaurant industry hurt severely. Afterwards whole ton incentives get people back out, plus three relief concerts help put money back industries.

Disney wants open up, well theme parks. get percentage people going. outbreak park, everyone freak out, disney get shit opening early, shut again.

Even don’t shut Florida, going visit aren’t locals? lot Canadians visit Florida summer. call snowbirds. people won’t come border closed, even could, don’t think many would. Canadians looking US wincing. like slow motion train wreck. Yeah, thanks. I’m guessing USA going get major change government soon. won’t viable country anymore. Revolution calling!! Got it, thanks! Trial run R&amp;D Blueprint system. 

It unethical deliberately expose candidate virus vaccine research. vaccine trials run worldwide areas active virus spread faster data collection. 

That includes US (most active country) still members given formal indications departure yet - even doubt would matter when/if do.

Most candidates grabbed GP networks reckon. it’s certainly good put hands options! age stronger could ever be. Makes feel lot things. Mad people trying downplay risks involved. Reaffirmed spending possibly year life essentially isolation smart choice even sucks. Generally sad state things understand it, oxygen usually tuned large machine many patients, given via portable tanks all. hate one convincing anti vax arguments I've ever seen. least compared normal stuff people come Nothing, capitalism failed. industrial oligarchy, people power... That's point... example, 25% positivity rate, every single sample would positive. used 12,500 tests run 10,000 samples... can't see majority landlords fellow citizens, real yikes lack empathy.

I lack empathy.

I'm saying housed landlord loses rental income way frame discussion Every industrialized country simply subsidized working class tune roughly 80% salaries, solves problem hell lot better forgiving rents normal human beings need pay mortgages.

And support minimum basic income. even need pandemic so. I'm fine subsidies.

I'm saying reframe conversation away imminent homelessness. one article heard much would really like information everyone's kind pretty quiet.

Doesn't inhibiting cytokine storm mean less people would need vents?

My best guess tested people dosage required realistic otherwise idea people talking this. Like either needs disproved taken pubmed needs verified figured seen used along therapeutics. Due high inequality, one MIT researcher one countries live members Temin calls “FTE sector” (named finance, technology, electronics, industries largely support growth). 20 percent Americans enjoy college educations, good jobs, sleep soundly knowing enough money meet life’s challenges, also social networks bolster success. grow parents read books them, tutors help homework, plenty stimulating things places go. travel planes drive new cars. citizens country see economic growth around exciting possibilities future. make plans, influence policies, count lucky FTE citizens rarely visit country 80 percent Americans live: low-wage sector. Here, world possibility shrinking, often dramatically. People burdened debt anxious insecure jobs job all.

Let's reopen!"". thanks Trump Republicans suck dick Prologue “I Legend” registered, yes. need proof residence registered.  !remindme 2 months see says tested positive. Unless know family personally? cost lies? we'll mistake truth. real danger hear enough lies, longer recognize truth all. love coppa wearing cute little bike helmet mask.... Right. Many countries sitting down, planning actively dealing fallout. 

Meanwhile, we're kicking 5 million insurance fighting masks  doubles protect blood clots since COVID induces hyper-coagulable state. Nice. saw CBC news thing claiming don’t enough domestic production big factory US. Therefore get vaccine way later since trump would take supply. hope that’s true :( Dont realize far reaching implications first shut starting feel now? work company directly tied economy. Businesses shut reopen, close doors everyday. businesses coming back. company alone, we've wage freeze, stock match stopped, major layoffs. they’ll ok, government take care them. people think US shut work home safe living reality. ok grocery workers go stock shelves cashiers put risk. expendable workforce right? going safe homes?! don’t know even care forum. echo chamber r/Coronavirus lockdown everything give government cheese. truth everyone wont saved. argue reduce deaths forcing everyone stay home, communist country. (Even though many Americans think living communist Chinese conditions would better dirty evils capitalism). one forcing anyone go homes. Well maybe except gas station attendants grocery store workers, they’re expendable. logic echo chamber here, guilty putting workers risk death need toilet paper food.

🦠🤗🦠 I'm sure comes huge comfort 50 bucks get adult swim lesson help point right direction. Hopefully lingering effects possible covid-19 infection.

That's good advice. could crappy technique that's leaving breathless; surprise me. 

I still feel like wind lot easily since sick, tho. Going many stairs leaves winded used to. Maybe shape, tho... okay mostly old people /s  True, personal risk. Plus get infected family's personal risk. Plus infect anyone else people's personal risk. Plus people infect families family's personal risk...

It's exponential. scary. best thing bare minimum. yourself, everyone around you. Wear mask.  Depends testing keep up. doubts. Sunday always drop cases deaths Totallly agree, see world 2022 play professional sports? Rob Baquera says officers arrested woman finding several stolen items nearby Dick’s Sporting Goods store vehicle.

What pulling pants micturating floor store enough warrant arrest? full-blown flu season millions people infected, possible summer? safer areas Tenn? helps people least need assistance, still jobs! Gold fool's buy. Buying gold recession get burned time Trump doesn’t hit hole one feels bad golf parter. never hit hole one. think that's blood plasma treatment - loads antibodies swimming around go straight work. That's limit knowledge though. cannot imagine anyone safely living EU would think one second moving America! would insane POS leading us death destruction godforsaken country mention appalling lack safety net abject worship billionaires government serves. alone! Super fun fact working small ratios: ratios may look scary (like deaths per million going 0.75 3.3), 300% increase rate sounds terrifying. live UK spring basically winter less cold rain. However, understand sentiment haha hey, moron. antibodies, still know long cells b cells immunity last. besides, antibodies virus always stay blood forever, usually cells, b cells remember virus years produce antibodies.

you morons say ""there immunity"" really learn immune system works comes viruses.

so crash course idiots can't understand adaptive immune system's extra informative videos yes videos, pretty much say thing, less appears morons understand immune system works, hopefully different videos, saying things different ways get morons video uploaded today talking long term immunity covid link paper peer-reviewed talking about. evidence long term immunity. take 10,000 samples mix together batches 4. need 2,500 tests 2,500 mixed samples. test mixed sample comes back clean, 4 people cleared. mixed sample comes back positive, they've got individually retest 4 people who's samples got mixed together.  


If tiny percentage population it, mixing effective saving time. many people it, individual tests quicker. worked Wuhan 200 people positive 6.5 million. 25% positivity rate would render method pretty much useless. low single digits, method would save ton time. crazy! tested positive month ago symptoms 3 days. Feeling great. Definitely beatable virus. heart goes toward front line workers! real heroes Actually. Yes. 

From 1781 1790, USA governed federally articles Confederation. strong enough federal government really.

The United states fact confederacy, that's angle CSA went drumming support. Close texas borders. Keep  also happened NYC area 4 months ago yet TX learned nothing. mortgage lending standards tightened since then, scale unemployment [whole Man, get much federal money trials. Doesn’t seem right go away, Trump proven right, according him. coasting decades.

Boomers convinced we're best decided meant sit ass laugh everyone sucking never evolve further.

We're watching mindset wrought real-time United States destroys stupidity. Defensive huh?

If America’s numbers supported tone. Yea states even vote dead people say burger flippers don’t deserve $15 hour it’s job high schoolers would call zombie walking. know sure month two, hopeful aren’t seeing healthcare workers infected virus early pandemic get reinfected returning work (at least far know). 

Long lasting immunity would ideal totally necessary since booster shots provided. put STIs backpackers UK spread think it’s fair! know people talking points. It’s conservative media feeding it. *Laughs Turkish* saying thing victims brain damage, ""chill everyone, need worry. turned arena makeshift field hospital. Quit suckered worrying dying. happens everyone Cott suffer in."" think would say? honestly know thought ask question Hey man, trying like you, know, cherry picking things fit narrative. Looks like failed self-awareness test.

We're still failing deal COVID-19 every turn. Cope harder, buddy. Ah yes. world remembers this. Mistakes made got shit together. Something like bother desantis do. least decent life wait vaccine. change anything. can't see majority landlords fellow citizens, real yikes lack empathy.

If rent forgiveness simply fucks small landowners, push pain different group people. landlords people extra room house, mega corporation bank.

Every industrialized country simply subsidized working class tune roughly 80% salaries, solves problem hell lot better forgiving rents normal human beings need pay mortgages. 

In America, ruling class done terribly efficient job splitting poor working classes bourgeoisie other. longer fight amongst ourselves, longer remain enslaved. Thank much! great prices used golf carts. former company didn't. 2 positive cases beginning. get arrive work usual. open email see building quarantined one supposed onsite. call supervisor ( working home btw) tell worry upstairs continue day usual. PISSED. 2 cases popped afterwards. watch Fox News wear mask. I’m also speech therapist kick anyone’s ass says anything negative lisp Canadian immigration far stricter often degree marketable skills even considered. Believe me, easier would hopped many years ago. America shitty place. Obviously. realize work like that? No, can't move Canada whenever feel like it. 

Feels like went google searches moving Canada spiked Obama trump election wins. lot bark, bite. mean *China* MERS SARS though. lot confidence Americans necessary. People work home pandemic get extra cash! Starts tomorrow Victoria, Australia! Looking forward influx adult toddlers filmed overreacting simple courtesy. different Moderna vaccine tests? hope so, since would nice multiple organizations come vaccine independently other. r/CambridgeUniversity gutted forgot climate change, bro. Holy fuck people BEYOND clueless. think people unemployed feel like working? need little bit encouragement get couch? fuck *wrong* you? Man, supposed go Taos Red River summer. live Amarillo though cancelled meat packing numbers spiked bc afraid gonna get really bad here. kinda stabilize it’s rising recently don’t think blame meat packing 

At least people somewhat good wearing masks I’ve seen really, can't determine optimal strategy unless assign negative result vaccine. Since passed safety trials risk vaccine extremely low risk permanent damage COVID fairly high well documented. 

You get vaccine course, exercising right idiot game theory big braininess. Yes, always, even outside circumstances known high-risk infectious disease. wants get random fluid blood whatever splashed eyes? knows patient undiagnosed HIV Hep C?

You know medical professionals don’t do? Wear face shields without mask time, recommend others so.

This article ridiculous. nothing add comment point ~2,000 dead day one 9/11 *every day.* ATTENTION EVERYONE RUN LIVES ROBOTS TAKEN WORLD

........

OUR WORLD

*pandemonium ensues* get one March MA, symptoms severe enough time. would work brilliantly area cjmadson lol get cremated right? Maybe limited way. sneezes would end face shield.

But air cough breathe would shield. There’s multiple vaccines supposed completed early next year, Oxford university isn’t one. It’s bad enough man done nothing help fight pandemic, he’s actively working spread it. wish people Georgia remember come Election Day. someone puts mash mask. technically mask absolutely nothing stop covid We'll something racist immigration policies incredibly shity way treat foreign visitors country happen doubt Xinjiang ever Wave 1 months ago, NO, wave 1 Xinjiang. Good analogy ^ Grand opening, grand closing “Harmless” US Dollar considered reserve currency. It’s tied international markets value helps determine value currencies’ value. government capable printing money citizens, damaging value dollar.

Why believe government capable bailing 38 million people? age like milk. Mark words. 7 day average deaths way up, garbage reporting this? friend sick little week hospitalized. varies case pre-existing conditions. Every country figured out? live USA I've lived countries. I've never one worked out. referring to?

Most countries know full lock-down people hurting badly. I’ve seeing employment ads FEMA month. known going happen. It’s unconscionable. masks, shut down, pathetic stimulus money, distribution Federal aid timely manner except money corporations. treatment Puerto Rico hurricane ineptitude, warning. Puerto Rico. Unless rich.

We need change country. non paying tenant basically guaranteed squatter. guaranteed squatter obviously worse risk squatter mask Front Open eyes Ya two sisters low risk teachers.

One sister says would much rather go back person, everybody required wear masks. parents live access all-day everyday would drive mad.

The one furious idea sending teachers back classroom. adamant everybody stays home. even talk sister passionate this.

I'm getting middle two.

At end day, think voluntary choice. teachers forced return. seem dishonest me. concerned saline would benign, would easy everyone (researchers included) tell actually vaccine. Using control vaccine meant symptoms associated viral vector vaccines would appear groups. symptoms could ignored significance occurrence. god damn sorry hear that, really dumb. hope feeling better!! sign live people? No, guys, really need bars restaurants reopen. COVID thing bunch nonsense! /s I've waiting Millenial government ANYTHING climate change. give companies ""Green Tax Credits"" people work home. takes cars road keeps emissions down. companies going want it. states counties lockdown again, won't. signed lease place last week move back. Previously lived decade. Left Burrito Box Montgomery Juan Tabo shut down. Well mean really, left cause got sweet job video game company dream.

&amp;#x200B;

But heart, like ""fuck new mexico"" closing Burrito Box. God burritos shit. /s =p except Brazil India pretty poor countries, social distancing can't apllied lot people can't buy masks. US, pure stupidity  She’s implying first hand knowledge contents post. could know “black spots” patient ants? could know hospital across street empty? first hand knowledge this? Assuming Biden wins starts getting America's shit together day he's sworn in, it'll take four six months minimum get acceptable level. prepare fucked 2021. ""nurse"" Florida reporting Texas conditions non-hospital. can. country good chunk people pro-virus poorly run education systems right-wing government. I'm feeling better Apart influenza strains can't think any. Influenza, need 35-45% infected get herd immunity - virus mutates tbe daughter strains continue circulate. 

So yeah apart vaccination, see natural infections lead herd immunity. Social distance obviously works dont see anybody mile away. doubt scientific justification 6ft social distance anything meaningful. mask work ineffective scientifically proven. take measures take something else work simply stupid incompetent. take measure speaking anybody breath go farther nobody imposes that. speaking policy probably work believe mask works. 2020 year I've never expected happen I'm alive. :( Trump's gibberish quarrels everyone disagrees with. Oxford planning challenge trial. thing even close gathering going canoeing Father-In-Law literally shut river house rural Michigan 7 months. Like I've locked house except grocery runs time period. woke 2 weeks went called like 3 make sure alright nightmare gave something. shit again. Who's going address it? responsible answer one shareholders. peak capitalism work. dont think anyone prepared bad going get country. Sometimes trailer. hauling example steel trailer. moving around tankers fluids might usually owned companies. highly dependent. true.

Insurance expensive unoccupied units. California insurance companies give 30 days tenants still vacant required purchase different policy normally 20 percent more.

There advantage leaving property vacant several disadvantages (squatters, vandalism, etc). disagree. real test vaccine whether people actually become immune surviving virus. never made vaccine virus become immune (to knowledge, 25 vaccines. corrected). 

So, actual question become long-term immune COVID-19? do, optimism. probably develop amazing new vaccine technology actually want work.  


This paper promise. thing actually watching though re-infection rates. information going really important going forward.  People know intubation is. horrifying, private hellscape, weeks. maybe also inverted, naked ass air. Younstill never explained said wrong. saying short demand mask going people actually needed them? baseball happening HS right lol I'm done.

Fuck country. I'm learning real in-demand skill, giving dreams, moving Canada. worth it. want future kids grow here. want live here. want grow old die here.

This unfixable. That's fucking breaking point. that, could imagine backlash embarrassment one pf US companies created vaccine first barred rest world accessing account profit? I’ve hoping another country gets vaccine first avoid outcome. Otherwise would one hated countries planet...more so. think right thing frustrated time. Let’s honest, wearing mask isn’t ideal. Nothing ideal right now. people want moan don’t blame long know what’s right stick rules. 

I’m UK wearing mask isn’t quite heavily debated/ politicised maybe it’s different here.  Oh yea. know couple trad caths absolutely obsessed Trump. That’s kind learned trad caths little bit full shit know bigger words. Fauci got balls throw around. Manual folding fans seriously under-rated. put Disney Land Florida? Disney World enough? Moderna pays $100 per session, $1100 total. mean dark, hope end life planning done seem best euthanize themselves. someone put blank check front told fill whatever number wanted exchange dining Houston, even touch check fear virus it. I'm road Austin I'm afraid go supermarket, wearing mask. worst part happening **PERFECTLY FUNCTIONAL HOSPITAL ACROSS STREET.**

COVID patients apparently banned hospital stay ""clean"" make millions surgeries.

STABLE patients dying oxygen deprivation corpses left days living covered ants. preserve hospital's reputation. Fuck gambling might eventually win. not. loses. stopped mandating masks, people would wear them. According previous threads, also takes 2 weeks death finalized recorded happened. need last part say ""cut pasted "" this.

Anyone writes like that, also know use paragraphs. already one (not America, though, maybe Italy?) guy saying sister dead one come take body away. Behind guy, could see dead sister lying bed. Facts care feelings. right decision. Reddit gold worthy imo happens international travel meaningful percentage Americans refuse take vaccine? continue get blocked rest world? Shade structures cheap. Medium time start recovery 7 days. 50% people reported complete recovery 1 month, 40% report parital recovery, 10% report recovery. link studies later. Take care look mental health, isolation loss smell taste linked increase risks Oh know.

I absolute best distance people work manager grocery chain here. hard always keep least six foot distance people. 


If busy, head back crowd dissipates. 

I can't wait leave state. year left college I'm hopefully out. Lol. guy photo shoots throwing first pitches. problem Statewide mask order month ago. Restaurant closures started 17 days ago. Hopefully things working It’s *possibly* good sign, trying say. former coworker agency. know name agency, NYC Texas (she would say exactly, I’m assuming RGV context clues.) used post social media experiences. asked Texas worse NYC responded emphatically ‘yes’.

And posts begging folks take Covid seriously, she’s seeing horrible things, etc, gone. doubt threatened something. algebra publishing? place needs shut everyone fired. sort simplistic authoritarian thinking popular Reddit? could favour vaccines I’ll happily first line one. policy would backfire many different ways it’s almost unimaginable. It’s near certainty would lead long term reduction vaccination levels.  South Carolina Yeah phrased bad. 7.6% alarmingly high. get insensitive victim possibly true genetic trait common black people makes vulnerable, acknowledge could lead better care? Researching mechanism behind could lead better treatments better understanding mechanism disease general I’ve seen [crazy stats actual cost childhood trauma.

""Once leave liberal bubble SF/Oakland, NorCal somewhat conservative."" case Norway, reacted early infection rate right low. public health experts concluded would take 200,000 people wearing masks prevent one new infection current rate. country 5 million people, means mask mandate would prevent 25 infections - deaths, infections. ways that. 

Masks might recommended mandated future number new infections rises again. now, people following recommendations reasonably well, government public health experts reluctant ask without clear reason. Washington Let states govern Ohhh Oxford still premier institution world I’m surprised haven’t banned account LA opened dining. NY still yet. one example. Yes probably health care workers first. Hopefully everyone gets shortly tho Nah guys chance left! pay King's taxes even that. Read articles, overloaded. Florida begun rise get worse next days/weeks.  political blowback

I think free, nothing reason. mother always says ""the fact someone goes college mean college goes him"". Trump impose ban canadian trucks entering USA next week reaction article. Well it’s confirmed wearing mask social distancing enough curb spread, it’s actually dumb keep economy closed.

The real problem lack mask enforcement. Pretty much every business doesn’t involve eating drinking could fully reopen masks enforced. sort worth risk. Fuck economist it. make people wear masks? countries problem wearing them, many Americans? must something convince anti maskers Oxford trials April already prior work thing SARS gave advantage. Russia tested 1 month declared ready.. living rock still following sub? Psssh, Boston 2 top 2! they've exhausted limit national commercial testing labs USA since whitehouse sat hands three months

Newsflash: SAFE WAY REOPEN OFFICE ENVIRONMENT AGE CORONAVIRUS! office obsolete anyone work computer working home, exceptions. people go office work specialist equipment office. Don’t forget 90 Deaths. total 5,072 Floridians died. Something tells week Florida see 200+ daily deaths. need permanently system. user said, there's ""memory"" involved. even fade, hit body ""remembers"" produce again. I'm jealous. started job February(lol). leverage anything. I'm lucky job new goal self employed/self sustaining 5 years. employer one best area response still garbage. Time thing. Especially time year hotter Satan's asshole. Still ways go great news surge capacity, etc. ended needing extra beds, that's added like 200% capacity stopped elective surgeries.

Which trained do, no? ""Surge capacity"". reacted according plan, everything went according plan, hospitals straining keep surge new coronavirus patients."" keeping Arizona, Florida brink

And sure measures place increase capacity.

Look .. hearing exact ""ON BRINK DISASTER"" stories past 3 weeks places.  new day new article things collapse, 3 4 days later story. week later same. 3 weeks later kinds stories people showing 3 weeks ago. ""Things get really bad!""

And every day predictions continue happen.

Hey 12 days ago - [43 Florida ICUs Reach Capacity, Show Beds Available Coronavirus Cases herd immunity doesn’t require 100% population it. I'll - free charge. Note though based previous wiper installs, may come ever need use them. Walgreens gives free flu shots am. proof politicians work people. (the US) done poor job assisting citizens. countries allowed citizens collect 80% pay lock furloughs. US stimulus consisted one-time $1,200 extra $600 unemployment expires week. enough especially people completely lost jobs. way make ends meet unemployment alone. Yet politicians making decisions without knowing real issue people seeing. true. They've taken granted summer. ha ha ha, “good news”. Nearly every hospital icu space hot spots people Texas waiting 10 hours come ambulance go hospital, deaths high, that’s good news.

Ever consider possibility spreading vulnerable population spill over? People work nursing homes elderly facilities. come, wait.

As trump said weekend, “I’ll right eventually”. Though moron talking end virus, yeah, eventually come true....but lot things then. stupid.  look 1918 regions best economically imposed strictest Spanish Flu restrictions. 12,490 next year. using numbers provided 15k. guess didn’t work full year. Eh, Missouri pretty awesome look KC St Louis. Maybe like outdoor stuff like lakes. Branson gets ton tourism, locals insufferable. 

Kansas City top ten cities, really chill. St Louis cool stuff, problems KC. 

Missouri 1000 times better lot states. Kansas especially, Arkansas... least Arkansas pretty. Nothing redeeming Kansas. Nice try FBI Trials stage much safety efficacy.

People forgetting main hindrance past developing vaccines often produce antibodies - adversely impact immune system ways anticipated early development. Restrictions home states leading ‘no fun’ people head think party still raging. Screw people, tell it’s happening mentality persists things get better. Good Miami Beach, attractive places traveling party crowd need get vaccine. Sooooooo many karens Skip cure Whenever vaccine, questions much protection provides, long lasts, much costs pays it, soon \-you\- (anyone) get it. 

So whether company selling vaccine 3 months matters much.

Why take away remind me? Don’t want rub face it? think would amazing right - I’ll gladly eat words. 

Remindme! 3 months wondering possible sanitize n95 mask.

I 3d filament dryer reach 70C. read cooked 75C 30 minutes. left 70C hour would sufficient work regardless.

Thanks.  Lol. can’t even get parents give kids proven vaccines prevent things like fucking polio. nutters aren’t going get covid vaccine add weirdos think Bill gates wants chip them... even vaccine works well tomorrow.. isn’t going away while. What’s good thing people won’t able get Sick vaccine family said would wait get vaccine (Oxford approved) possible longer term side effects become clearer. side effects months road valid concern all? actually care fetus, despite religious excuses false justifications come with, except secondary effect controlling punishing women.

Source: me, owner share AstraZeneca St. Louis, KC, Branson, Ozarks. coincidence, Chad Ox One frat pledge name researcher. Swede. would absolutely say heard immunity. back conclusion statistics folkhälsomyndigheten, Swedish health authorities. 


This page shows COVID statistics folkhälsomyndigheten (Swedish health authorities). 

The statistics middle right shows ""how many new intensive care patients per day"". reliable data, since statistics dont rely doubtful corona-tests 100% sure. sick need intensive care, show statistics. see, new cases per day like 2 -3 new. many. WHOLE country. 

&amp;#x200B;

The statistics upper right show ""new diseases per day"". se, middle May month, increase sick people. Thats Sweden started test intensively . statistics good showing things going. increased testing, thats see new cases.  


The statistics lower right show ""deaths per day"". see, deathrate declined almost zero. Thats WHOLE country!  


Does Swedes started quarantine get statistics lower? No. Actually, since summer warmth came beginning June, late May, see Swedes started ignore social distancing rules. see packed cafes, see people go gym ordinary, people attend gym classes (aerobic, spinning... ) everybody sweats, breathes heavily, people go shopping malls forth. 

&amp;#x200B;

With everything stated here, would say Sweden herd immunity. backed claims statistics folkhälsomyndigheten, Swedish health authorities. dont thrust data, sure hell cant thrust ""Norwegian researchers"" either. fuck get statistics from? measure every Swedish hospital? No, dont. need rely data folkhälsomyndigheten. Actual 5 months prepare what? Hard save money making any. Hard find job people hiring bc nothing's open. 

Also, none remotely effects personally. least year's worth expenses savings. pretty unprecedented situation think people deserve little grace handle it.

When sign says speed limit 75, drive 105 nobody right force anything don’t consent to, rightfully arrested, imprisoned, fined, punished reckless behavior. People get run road forced handcuffs kind behavior.

Masks save lives. It’s really simple. Refusing wear one puts people around risk death serious disability. society every right force issue.

Although, honestly, shouldn’t to. Wearing mask act compassion. see someone blindly refusing something simple cover face midst worst pandemic collective lifetime insane. It’s least do, even wanted view completely selfish manner, keeps safer too. new neighbors move across street state. introduce myself, hard really meet people can't shake hands, see actual face, hangout. *Unelected governor.

We’re complying. Stop false rhetoric Florida straight ignoring mask mandate. news show *one* angry redneck, people act like every fucking person state. There’s 21 million people here. 

And don’t use “end June” kind attack. Every state relaxed requirements beginning June, including California New York. US started requiring masks time.

Not really, I'm big fan Modi, tried alleviate situation take seriously, however country like India way many problems inside virus simply abuse.

Patriot Act, Freedom information act happened? knows minorities disproportionately affected. wants dead. Facebook Guess won’t need vaccine it’s available because.. ya know.. “not immune systems same” wouldn’t want chance it. comparison state COVID well managed (NJ), booked appointment day testing (7/17) got results back 2 days later 7/19. 

Florida unfathomable got point...

edit: tested negative, cold something probably? antibody test Worldometer 15k lower Florida numbers arcgis dashboard have. 

Hospitals reporting feds whole country dark. data isn’t available public. lot people dying COVID already contributed 8,000,000 economy (very southern states handling btw)  wonder Carl Pilkington would think guy using face such...

Edit: idea format comment smart play run both. Easily identifiable new accounts get removed short time. older accounts operate impunity site gets distracted low- hanging fruit new accounts. vaccine basically AOL screenname. #I'M VIROOOOOSING get point, agree.....

But go tangent: entire history life arms race. Would silly think finally ""won?"" beat viruses good?

If do, pressure radically change things? Perhaps, big evolutionary leap?

I know likely, see train thought. Fantastic Fuck that. Gimme vaccine protect unmasked idiots I'm surrounded by. I've responsible whole damn time! wondering. metric 1.5-3 years develop vaccine come from? know logistics must extremely complicated, technology advancing fast enough judging time frame something today based something decade ago inaccurate? Yeah, that’s rich go. Leave rest us die.. people Europe actually followed order. seems California care vacations entertainment lives susceptible. Irish person near tourist town here! confirm are. Masks made compulsory bunch places American lady staying near bit strop told wear mask, nothing extreme videos go viral. thing is, results taking long get tested come back negative, think fine go public really got virus week test. u supposed 3 weeks waiting results? stay home? go work? Cool anecdotal bias according studies - minorities likely wear masks whites people. JFC Go twitter look first hand accounts. There’s even grants available teachers want become home school teachers. 

A friend mine English teacher gets paid $50 hour right teaching kids don’t want left behind school wise. UK already said vaccine leaving UK vaccinated cousin ICU nurse Miami. I’m constantly worried family. Maybe need united again.

Jk, please don't. Yeah agree non-comparable, amount deaths due mismanagement crisis much greater covid really bad comparison Willie hear ya, Willie don’t care Thank you. Neat. Ben American.

It's okay talk negatively historical figures. mainly take issue sense ""here's working vaccine problems"" they're communicating public. VASTLY different controlled study clear expectations might get sugar pill. Someone make app that. could call ""Hitch"". There's good news vaccine development lately, yeah, it'll still months manufacture enough everyone.

I'm 32 year old healthy dude... Probably last line vaccine (as be)... yeah going masks while. Yes. it’s still damn big Facts. Challenge trials may determine efficacy quickly, still takes time determine safety. need parts get approval clinical use.  Biden fatal anyone Trump.

So, enormous advertisement vote guy worse? lol Man, hold goddam presses, game want better process, Biden choice, process left 4 years Trump. It'll dictatorship.

What policies create ""better process""? follow Biden's platform I'm sure referring People dissatisfied Biden would vote hopes getting better candidate later.

I know mean sounds like people planning life giant meteor wipes humanity hits... get it? anything left.

You're describing climate change fact neither Trump Biden plan sufficient enough halt human extinction.

I single candidate stop that. voting guy confer mysterious new plan. Politics magical. Sssshhhh sub hates good news Trump doesn’t pay anything. ""There guarantees, we’re yet &amp; trials necessary - important step right direction.""

The US whole once, no, hurricane hits judge Florida California's ability treat patients.

NY, NJ, lot north east overwhelmed back April complete inability treat everyone without canceling elective surgeries, adding surge capacity, etc. ended needing extra beds, that's added like 200% capacity stopped elective surgeries. it? Arizona, Florida 1/6 hospitals completely full. 

Surge capacity desperately needed, part disaster relief. Saying vaporized fact make real. drug highly effective unethical placebo group receive also given treatment. dont understand someone anti-science...

Assume fundamentalist Christian believe bible 100% literally true everything. bible says everything created 6 days implies animals created day. scientists come along say evolution true earth created 4 billion years creatures evolving billion years. conflicts worldview prove scientist wrong.

(Note: grew strict Pentecostal household, people knew taught early age ""errors"" scientists).  hate say small companies seem even worse regard. local store work getting hit hard $. told could come flu symptoms day felt better. week ago. So... here’s super cool idea. people wear masks, don’t catch coronavirus, get hugs validation pandemic... cause won’t dead! See works?? sacrifice hugs today, get die get hugs later. cool investment! try it. haha good luck staying Canada illegal american, unless get refugee status that's quick deportation. Given way certain people keep downplaying this, fear save lives.

So that's agenda. help agenda mention situations even covid-positive result? like fuck trying here? would go back revisit somebody talking anecdotal stories even involve covid positive result? Yep, Tennessee agree. wear mask every day. time home, car office work. walk 1/4 mile parking lot office every day, even though work mandatory mask order, 50% employees wear mask. 


We brought back office June rotating schedule ppl office home keep things safer. older employees DGAF come cause like working home. job effectively home, see reason int eh office, get choice. think major driver lack economic safety net. lack social services means us can't afford shutdown. politicians say loud wiukd admitting ""evil socialism"" might actually necessary. 

Our level stupid difficult believe. 100% major breakthrough triumph humanity Yes Wait, Lancet released phase 1 2 results, thought releasing phase 1 results? ""Oxford"" vaccine name make awkward. Wait, people walk $30 vaccine? Thats 58 cents week! want situation millions upon millions claiming. money says safe

There tons examples product unsafe even despite existence insurance money. economy famish millions people enough food growing everyone eat probably worth saving anyway. It’s amazing media keeps pushing narrative Americans don’t wear masks completely wrong yet people Netherlands example call covid hoax actually don’t wear masks. 

Ridiculous. hell wrong scandinavia.

We're testing like crazy everything coming back negative. country (Denmark) reopened economy nearly 2 months ago, point recommending masks general public, throughout time numbers declining declining, close flat 0. CANNOT explain possible, understand it, reality is. suggesting US same, situation clearly different you. lot still understand disease, could unknown factor choking spread here, think studied, dismissed. No. that's odd question ask context unrelated, non-sequitor statements made record private citizens. saying that’s good thing bad thing? We're global recession, stock market always showing weakness. Care take guess we're global recession? article behind paywall... Please hurry Another one mass producing vaccine phases complete. expensive gamble vaccine proven work safe, one save lot time. 10-15 years properly test vaccine....not 10 months. want. need lab rats test product. Enjoy experiment. whats worst happen vaccine. nothing serious side effects worry about? talking autism here, overall side effects? Seriously, part plan speed vaccine phase 3 trial right guys? Definitely mass stupidity! vaccine September

It would even impressive get 50% public get it. Yes. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Gee...who could predicted this....oh wait me, saying back re-open protests such, thing different is, getting 3k deaths expected, due change treat covid still people getting sick, people huddlng back inside ones leaving. got short term relief recovery nothing.  also theories medical professionals inflate number coronavirus deaths, hospitals facilities get money ""the government.""
 
This one's slap face frontline workers. healthcare system hemorrhages money outbreak. Tons elected procedures get canceled deferred, staff get sick pay overtime, there's huge strain supply equipment, etc... 
 states hardest hit virus March April — New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Massachusetts Pennsylvania — got least amount federal support per patient
 
In general actually mind much federal tax dollars disproportionately used prop other, poorer states. mind elected leadership also actively sabotaging public health efforts. see: portland

of course they're killing us off, stand non-republicans existing nation There's also questions surrounding cost long antibodies remain. far Moderna's Pfizers' showed 2m, I'm sure that's timeframe (and going continue future) starting drop point. It’s anti-elitist, pro-coal, pro-manufacturing mindset. It’s lot better/cheaper dump coal ash river vs. coal jobs it’s dirty fuel. don’t want hear that, ignore everything else science says.

The people don’t depend polluting industries don’t think way. significant portion Americans hold fiery, passionate hatred anyone competent anything. includes science, medicine, leadership, anything really. live Nashville I've seen scary number people without masks. listened gas station attendant country man talk ""sheep"" ""breathing carbon dioxide masks"" ploy hurt Trump. 

I get it. selfish. 
Also, fuck people like this. Literally nothing said true. contry months mandatory mask Knew gave much room manoeuvrer around stuff can't answer, keep simple time even though got say. pain ass argue dishonest people.

None Denmark, Norway Finland use masks. constantly held countries handled well managed keep really low infection rate since beginning. lack masks affecting all. Yea Ice. scares me. office operating half capacity (half office works home one day half comes in, switches next day). everyone wears masks they're supposed (including CEO!) found coworker vacation one southern states based know (hates masks, downplaying things) highly doubt going self quarantine returns. told boss I'm sure else done, sigh. Oh top hates working home claims set remote working, I'm sure she'll back office Monday! still pay 60 dollars. Insurance covered part it. approved physician. man Stop saying shit like that. Nothing coming ea0rly 2021.

[They saying able produce 100m vials end 2020 PASS REGULATIONS 

even take account year observe secondary reactionary issues. cases past vaccines lead infertility lack trial testing long periods.

BUT 

EVEN companies state able produce 1/2 billion vials end 2021 APPROVED RIGHT NOW. need 60% coverage effective induce heard immunity.

Thats going effective combating virus long time. 

Its important people dont take news stories gospel think cure way relax let strict rules.

KEEP INSIDE KEEP SOCIAL DISTANCING PEOPLE.

heres people making researching vaccines fucking news media get paid grabbing NEver said dont accept good news. Good news vaccines show promise. Im saying dont say bullshit like vaccine coming makes people complacent.

You make offshoot comment like that, someone non serous skims comment sticks.

They come conversation people regurgitate comment without context idea spreading manipulations mutations throughout communities leads individuals making decisions like im gonna wear mask theres cure way anyways. serious theres cure coming couple months.

THATS TRYING GET UNDERSTAND.

Good News : AWESOME

False News : DETRIMENTAL. Michael Bay probably too. Everyone bunker  scary number sounds. remember Texas 30 million people. number nothing. saying life’s nothing saying shouldn’t live fear.

I’m open wrong thoughts. US half number single-person households Sweden. US areas far densely populated, New York hit hardest. US 3x obesity rate Sweden. US 40% citizens classified underinsured uninsured, whereas Sweden universal healthcare. Sweden paid sick leave.

Edit: Oops, never got point. Sweden didn’t large outbreak, yet numbers still worse ours. shouldn’t aspire like Sweden who’s death one worst world. Also, Sweden (in opinion) socially distance respond virus better. country doesn’t dense areas like do, way people living alone. Finally, population appears less risk. US unhealthy healthcare system shit. Heck, even ABC tries little neutral diplomatic, publicly funded, pretty damn [US think anyone trying balance/facts would be, tbf. Don’t ass.

Legacies bad forget systemic racism affirmative action. people function daily. Thanks. chilling, seeing many people taking extremely alarming event seriously enough. Feels like there's true lack intelligent reasoning running around, either them. want anyone die, part hopes hardcore deniers ones pay highest price shortsightedness. pay 25% federal, 10% state, 6% local plus 8% sales tax anything buy. already pay Medicare social security access it. health insurance works 13% income run allowed work 6months. would've let make mailbox. open slot put whatever want inside. cities didn’t problem rioting pandemic, y’all sure fuck better stay home voting it.

Even state level, one size fits isn’t great solution. Federally would nightmare policy would strict lax vast majority people. 

Example: Chicago / Chicagoland strict rules rural IL. Rural IL may specific rules aren’t issue Chicagoland (animal / live stock).

It goes ways. see many videos people freaking wearing mask, restricts breathing medical conditions cant breath etc... don’t wear clear face mask shields? doesn’t restrict breathing seems acceptable form protection public, least better nothing. currently big box retailer see employee customer mask face shield on, seems fine is. stores keep clear face shields hand combat anti maskers?

Common sense, ya know? Partisan politics tends wipe aspect people's brains. pandemic shown anything, it’s far morons country ever thought possible.

There's two types morons causing right now. first ""moron power"" concerned self-interest, namely reelection booming economy also personal financial considerations, willing sacrifice human life means make hard decisions say things people like.

The second ""everyday moron"" want believe anything bad ever happen them, deny problem all. follow lead local regional ""moron power"" justify it, surround ""everyday morons"" reinforce behavior.

There probably several hundred first type moron. Unfortunately, encourages second type moron.

Gotta say though, ever since 2016 I've known least 60M morons country, either type 1 type 2. Lmao Yeah realize matter infected, run doctors/nurses/beds, that's real trouble starts. people burned good news often. case, yeah. Make sure stay inside plague walker :).  Im sure claim side effects long term studies. good news nonetheless **If** happens, distribution still take considerable amount time. I've already written rest year matter what. would argue economic social collapse side effect stay-at-home orders. pandemic cause - pandemic *response* did. made right decision believe. 70k+ cases enough get coherent national response people taking seriously, inevitably lead another lockdown. Question's if, when...

Going add remindme see bad get 2-3 months. pisses companies get business loan use workers keep themselves. Well according article 70% fever headache receiving vaccine, seems like fairly high rate reaction compared vaccines. short term big deal. However long term one knows. would wait couple years see negative side effects long term Lets hope so! Idk, standards declined considerably Dumbledore gone. want get high Thanos? pretty well wearing masks Columbus I’ve state 4 weeks really don’t know rn Go  correlation political party virus transmission look county (lockdown decisions made county level). saying trump company haven’t shit bed, let’s make political is. say NY “killing it” one worst outbreaks whole world, bit stretch....

I severe addict/alcoholic would never gotten better stop looking friends/family going, ""they worse me, problem, I'm bad I'm okay!""

Social Distancing still important long dont spike keep inside part irrelevent. remember Ebola hitting West Africa 2014-2016 people storming hospitals widespread belief going hospital got people infected. naive thinking happen here. totally underestimated power denialism. Nice one mate! Sorry, real life correct.

The US woefully unprepared terrible work culture sick leave policies.

For example, let's say feel cough coming covid test. wait 10 days comes back negative.

Great news, wasted sick leave. 

If feel cough coming get tested again? 

Probably means might get fired job.

I usually get 2-3 colds year. 6 weeks sick time cover getting tested sheltering home every time get cough.  People's selfishness causes perversely angry denial deaths occur terrible satisfaction. People morons I'm sorry parents, must frustrating. Mine also Texas careful. want keep good health care. Oops oh attached job, more.. yes that's us okay, promising yet far unknown Brits complain everything tbh.  STL needs secede, associate moron. KC come too. Honestly even family groups point?

Only one takes test, quarantine positive. Social groups might work, went test sore throat, one contact went in. Thry waited give clear. SARS 1 vaccine produced anti bodies too. upon exposure virus caused cytokine storm killed 100% trial animals. 

That hasn’t happened far SARS 2 idea happen human exposed vaccinated. Right previous experience evidence points dying. 

This risky trial. It’s already showing 70% negative side effects without exposure. 

I hope works, I’m actually hopeful will. vaccine approval process sketch af requires little proof efficacy meet approval. People won’t believe it. People refuse accept it. Coverage NYC getting slammed entirely ignored. Especially south, Midwest.

He’d intubate people knew would never make ventilator, desperately trying make last moments anything pure torture agony.

Yet still I’ve seen people know say don’t believe it’s bad. includes family members. One former friend boldly told dad lying, citing YouTube video.

But anyway, peer review exists good reason. Humans, nature, good discovering errors work. obviously good scientific accuracy. scientific journal worth salt requires every paper seeking published journal peer reviewed approved publication.

LA seems tapered little since last week. Hopefully vigilance keeps up. mean devolving. boost antibody response ,just like every vaccine. provide us method determining completeness data?

No?..... Oh okay. successful vaccine trains immune system prevents becoming becoming ill. point know vaccine trains immune system way looks promising can’t sure trials complete. don’t think it’s likely it’s possible immune system isn’t actually trained correct way stop Covid. headline correctly making distinction. also possible didn’t work failed train immune system, it’s worth reporting does. imagine tough thoughts must working field. hope find balance helps stay sane despite idiots. like economy vs. health debate -- misleading *immoral* act like either/or choice.

I've even tried lowering offering ask luck. party fault buckling algo/data structure practice coding interviews lot seems ton competition.

The alt-right/white supremacist playbook prey lot types radicalize surprising we're seeing intersection types showing protests. Unfortunately, white supremacy lot widespread Canada lot people seem think. bad long term learn them.

The longer live, mistakes learn from. can't count number times life thought, ""How hell would know going happen since never tried before?"" But, things happens, know expect next time.

Yes like Beeteguese move side road. successful vaccine trains immune system prevents becoming becoming ill. point know vaccine trains immune system way looks promising can’t sure trials complete. don’t think it’s likely it’s possible immune system isn’t actually trained correct way stop Covid. headline correctly making distinction. quarantined healthy.... raise red tyranny flags you. Nothing will. 

If government said buy walking license walk outside, $5, many would pay $5..... just.... saddening. assumption viruses spread way, especially given incubation time asymptomatic nature one.

Imean, scientifically thing could slow virus becoming less contagious (haven't seen evidence yet, correct I'm wrong) transmission vectors reduced means, social distancing etc.

I discount unrecorded self-imposition practices slow transmission prior government mandates. 

While hope right, science got wrong, worth risking wrong it.

Fact is, nowhere virus allowed run rampant unchecked. We'll never know bad uneventful(obviously been)it could been. Here's kicker, he's unelected governor. Well we’re hypothesis testing *right now* lol

in words Ernest Ruthersford, “If experiment needs statistician, need better experiment.”

This experiment doesn’t actually need statistician. It’s got foregone conclusion. already knew that. You’re apologist. Unfortunately, two years might enough everybody forget enough. would even make sense businesses. Instead closing everything, close businesses positive cases, provide aid strategically impacted closures, potentially impacted employees could get financial assistance quarantining, businesses would run normal. also provides incentive businesses follow protocols keep employees healthy, since deal hassle closing re-opening employees test negative.

Like changes fact 19 year old kid died something reasonably preventable Florida (and US whole) could get shit together.  Wow great response. look options. Cheers. 20% going positive though.

You're going use batch testing people come ER textbook COVID symptoms. going use population display symptoms. I'm beginning think length ones finger nails inversely correlated IQ... make good points. think scale lot it. daycare takes precautions right six kids classroom able separate groups pretty well. way six kids families part bubble now.

Many public schools (especially big cities) 25-30 kids per classroom and, looking middle school higher, individual teachers exposed hundreds kids daily. There's really room, enough teachers, funding create smaller classes. 

Then there's evidence younger kids (like daycare preschool) transmit virus easily older kids (10+).  think resuming middle school high school going incredibly difficult US right high levels community spread. don’t think opinion unpopular lol. want mask requirement genius. FYI. ...or learned mistakes... Either way!!  Fauci admitted lie save masks healthcare work.

 would speculate 95% actual racist people don’t wear masks like said don’t believe major people wearing masks racist. them, last week followers fox. orange. racist’s uneducated willfully ignorant. 

 would add press conference Governor DeWine orange saying good idea, consisted 20 minutes saying could happen Ohio, waiting end say way avoid wear masks. 90% people area live wearing around 60% before, obviously I’m guessing number. driving different county mandated masks shop before.  I’m ineligible donate blood unfortunately. Yep, should. masks become political? Trump selling MAGA masks instead dumbass it. judicial still issue stay. executive can’t make court issue stay. irony sickening, literally! nice!  hell people like assume everyone buying Starbucks every fucking day? No. They're not. know can't afford it. people struggling already making coffee home. even good coffee. fucking Folger's shit. Get fuck outta bullshit. can’t. grieve someone made political pawn instead victim national tragedy? don't. us. XD sure kid Good! Keep September safe. Help, need adu- scientist. need scientist! Erm... Right. That's first sentence still agree Disney open. Kushner takes vaccines hospitals sells higher profit Republican states bent knee Trump steals hospitals keep Trump Administration. guys. Bill Gate nanobots give us 5g this. 

It's think absolutely correct. Even sub see comments time redditors basically talking shit partner disagreements precautions. must volatile... vaccine far eastern KY baby. Drop hook border. want taking winning bigly virus back you. Well hopefully Oxford vaccine get's September try get US vaccinated early 2021. Wat 21 yos Zoomers Medical question: anyone seeing trend COVID positive patients using CPAPS home infecting family members? Also, education provided cleaning machine positive test result?  plague bearers California already locked Democrats election. Reddit self professed mandated best sway election. realize US govt paid $1.5 billion development vaccine, right? number hospitalized ICU patients turned Yes, really.

It's true states seeing positivity rates around 15%, self selecting group. people tested disproportionately go hospital (especially symptoms) places like prisons we're seeing positivity rates well 50%.

15% general population virus. everyone visiting sub advocating masks. saw people China S. Korea it. US anti-mask stockpile healthcare workers created narrative effective everything shitfest. ...and Sweden, considering involvement Astra-Zeneca. understand whh BBC article mention involvement. Maybe mentioning university makes sound better? critical care combat medicine military teams deployed Texas California. Guayaquil, Ecuador, bodies piled along streets hazard trucks pick up, public health infrastructure collapsed. Lots bad things “materialized”. might stupid asking would order many trials still done? This. Almost entirely this. someone Appalachian foothills Kentucky, literally mixture political affiliations along religious affirmations. become somewhat war information. perception ""hive mind"" dictating, vs perception officials science declaring. Couple lot population suffering slough co-morbidities would definitely compound fatally pandemic, makes truly perfect storm. Daddy pay it! wrong? Mask short demand given people actually need it, front line workers ill. mention, little knowledge actually known infects people.

Edit Interview -

""LaPook, March 8: There’s lot confusion among people, misinformation, surrounding face masks. discuss that?

Fauci: masks important someone who’s infected prevent infecting someone else… Right United States, people walking around masks.

LaPook: You’re sure it? people listening really closely this.

Fauci: …There’s reason walking around mask. you’re middle outbreak, wearing mask might make people feel little bit better might even block droplet, it’s providing perfect protection people think is. And, often, unintended consequences — people keep fiddling mask keep touching face.

LaPook: get schmutz, sort staying inside there?

Fauci: course, course. But, think masks, think health care providers needing people ill. **The people who, look films foreign countries see 85% people wearing masks — that’s fine, that’s fine. I’m it. want it, that’s fine.**

LaPook: lead shortage masks?

Fauci: Exactly, that’s point. could lead shortage masks people really need it."" pre-order get immunity boost DLC much fucking hate anti vaxxers, get one instance. Like, rushed vaccine human history? Hull, He'll Halifax good lord deliver us! It’s okay. still struggle figuring long microwave frozen burrito. Hazard name county. thing it’s stores. I’m glad enforcing this. seen way many people wearing mask crowded areas Chicago. 

So walking Trader Joe’s someone still give Today July 20, 2020. Funny thing never going need fake death numbers. Americans shown take care themselves. wanna talk way things deal reality? Well reality see numbskulls never take seriously unless Trump starts same. 

So need get shit together. maturity admit making mistake middle making exact mistake again? think called ""idiocy."" brain drain, means enough locally skilled labor keep demands.

But brain drain New Zealand?

The country good education system, excellent social security systems nearly balanced birth rate.

Where well-educated New Zealanders supposed emigrate replaced immigrants? call Branch Covidians. followers trump cult  happy actually disagree. looks likely vaccine widely available early next year would incentive keep lockdowns longer, online school fall semester etc wait get vaccinated move forward safely. we're acting like never vaccine could used justify openings 'can't keep things closed forever' etc. sense things, could see going either way. shouldnt take death raise concern. 

This world looking promising future. need stay home anymore, country stayed home mattered life less returning normal, cases few, inconveniences like wearing masks indoors   wealth tax, enough money cover (assuming flee offshore accounts countries). really like taking money people, think argument made federal reserve done addition previous environmental damage wealth generation created. rightly obtained would say no-go. Solely raising income taxes rich however would enough cover gap, raising middle class would devastate economy. Per capita, we’re better neighbors. I’m grateful here, area, many possibilities. We’re hunkering right now, I’m hoping everyone life avoids household accidents. 

And thank you, too. Florida last place I’d want week. smart man realizes fighting dumb dumb nothing us. assuming vaccine 100% coverage. least flu vaccine, that's even close true.

A likely outcome vaccine partial coverage, people still need wear masks public practice social distancing. saw one pic actual guy rest text message screenshots. We've 👏 👏 six 👏 months 👏 👏 prepare  encouraging ~~news~~ evidence COVID-19 immunity long-lasting. [Here good explanatory video posted today Dr. John goes details. think limits indoor gatherings widespread vaccine availability.

Not sure located, near possible go brewery/bar sit outdoors spaced tables. couple times. know much safer outdoor gatherings are, I'm comfortable seeing one two friends time we're sitting outside. I'm loving America right now, like everyone, every bad decision got together room tried figure could best fuck country load people shortest amount time possible complicated time possible. funniest bit is, look world's past, learn this? wee fuckkkkk. alternatives like face shields. 

A face shield alternative mask. face shield protects eyes rest face large droplets. nothing protect aerosols, importantly absolutely nothing prevent emitting aerosols presymptomatic. Masks needed block microdroplets aare exhaled people, otherwise evaporate leaving behind aerosolized airborne virus particles. suggest additional experimentation, animals propose that, frozen samples derived miners eventually opened Wuhan lab already highly adapted humans extent possibly anticipated researchers. One small mistake mechanical breakdown could led directly first human infection late Thus, one miners, likely patient 3, patient 4 (whose thymus removed), effectively patient zero COVID-19 epidemic. **In scenario, COVID-19 engineered virus;** but, equally, taken Wuhan molecular research performed planned virus would died natural causes, rather escaped initiate COVID-19 pandemic. reality isn’t enough jobs either go around... Honestly, beats me. guess is, lot Swedish COVID news, wrote writing they're running steam, alternatively scraping bottom barrel reason. 

It's basically thing seeing ""old person refused care"" headlines conveniently leave key word ""intensive"".  It’s alright. adaptors wipers overly complex. anyone tell say people complain vaccines rushed dangerous? mean, that's pretty wild strawman right there. never said kids deserve education. He's saying risks inherent form education isolated kids. families become risk, teachers risk. honestly think kids gonna learning well god forbid covid ends school, take home live-in grandmother gets it? People pull shit ass share strangers. wrong. Like black hole wrong here. long US style humanitarianism bombs yes That's positive outlook state putting in, precarious time politically world wide. voluntarily making vulnerable extended period time bunch countries recovering it, consider us threat. Huh, rest us call em dumb asses Yeah, I'm same.  stay inside whenever possible. would even need retest? one person family positive, need isolate anyway. probably correct would resulted economic downturn either way, think would seen lot rebound now. Let's not. Aw...cute. stop replying again. little discipline, maybe get self-control. Try skipping lunch starters. England Scotland’s governments pretty much aligned lockdowns,  

They tons people England (just like America) chafe told authorities think wearing masks means they're sort feeble weakling. facebook posts I'm seeing classmates England wearing mask makes cringe bad. One literally responded Bojo's FB post mandatory masks saying 'no way hell i'm that' smh.  President openly anti-science America’s detriment - he’s killing people, two ways it. 

That's broad, general statement. Yes, Trump abject failure national leadership Coronavirus - questioning that. However lot states actually managing Coronavirus quite successfully internet, y'all hear side pond failures sells clicks newspapers. Yea right, I’ll wait year least getting I’m gonna guinea pig soon comes Wow, Microsofts billions years! can’t see windshield today heart surgery, abdominal heparin shots week. 

I think anyone actually likes needles, many surgeries, blood draws, stuff like that, I've grown used them. 

Heparin shots, whatever reason, worst. Painful, burning annoying. Luckily, subsides within second pull needle out, among annoying things days hospital, coming someone healing ribcage (they ran saw right middle), surgical scar, several drainage tubes several IVs ready come they'd long flush easily. That's plot zombie movie, many zombie movies originates new medicine

I position here, I'm gonna take vaccine asap, wear mask, I'm saying work depending country move to. can't really ever come back states, debt would waiting deny leaving country legal matters settled. taxes. gonna say fuck I'm done country, really gotta sure ever coming back. Even visit. like multiple painkillers drugs market, vaccine comes along deemed least safe effective first, approved. also different types vaccines work different ways maybe target different bits mutation arises starts spreading (like we’ve already seen twice here), different type vaccine may better suited region. Also, it’s governments conferring approval countries. first one may approved U.K., another one may approved country first agencies review it. absolutely important options. polio vaccine went back forth one US government recommended times settled current one, years measuring immunity lifetime safety. American deserves suffer forced to

Pretty reactionary thing say remember *places* ... ? many list. simple Google show would-be COVID vaccine souls come along since March. “The incident drew smirk, chuckle two sentences Governor.”

Dick. Yeah that’s fast food places start $8 hour. recently graduated HS, friends worked place 8-10, me, $8.50. think that’s enough live on? isn’t. I’m fortunate I’m living girlfriend need pay $350 month rent, around $350 much I’d get per paycheck. right that’s 1 paycheck gone got another $300-400 get month. It’s ridiculous people try defend minimum wage. It’s simply enough. mention stress adds people. Yes people get roommates, yes people live parents, yes people try get better jobs understand doesn’t always work like that. French Revolution type. T-R-U-M-P Flu... 34m HK refugees coming soon [You remember beginning part plan directions. Minimum wage established 1 person could support family 3. It’s wrong wages haven’t kept inflation. goes spirit thing. \+1

I knew family smartest, listen reason, data, public health guidelines. They're partying, they're small (2 - 4 people) gatherings lasting 15 mins, without masks, indoors, without social distancing. Same. kind feel bad though, rats actually intelligent. read article? said infection patterns consistent high virulence virus. looking explanation COVID-19 absolutely rocket populations Wuhan rest China/ SE Asia, conversely reached geographic regions.

They simply ran initial low virulence exposure hypothesis model, actually seems explain one puzzling conundrums entire pandemic. science works! shown hypothesis plausible, others go gather evidence. That's encouraging least. 

Sorry brother. certainly divisive point families. Hopefully he'll come around. Ahhh, hear head!!! Seems like pretty cowardly way out.

Beyond that, reasonable educated people started packing bailing Canada France Germany New Zealand whatever, there'd pretty big problem: world's foremost military superpower shitton nuclear bombs entirely controlled far right nutbags. kids find consistent safety, 

Well throw window school even food

You shift money around set program deliver food. 1 year, make work. wife's district, example, prepared spend hundreds thousands webcams, going everything touchless (water fountains/doors/sinks), etc. Going online education negative effect mental health whole generation.

Better dying and/or spreading disease. Could give brief explanation means? sure right spot ask need opinion people actually take virus seriously one life does. 

I 22 work target extremely mild headache lasted 4 days straight. feel drowsy random points day drowsiness accompanied dizziness well. also waking dry throat water goes away. need concerned? want go work fear may spread it. took test friday still waiting results. shift later tonight
 go? fasttrack phase 3 phase 1 participants observation scaling phase 3 participants. You’re way focused masks. add protection, solve problem. 

In Sweden almost one worn mask time public since beginning right control situation without regional outbreaks like Barcelona Melbourne. right? Adhering social distancing. Much important. Stop crowding places like bars, malls, restaurants, buses, trams subways. put masks continue crowd places nothing positive happen. One worst things virus brought friends family. People thought rational ... not. I’ve got hoaxers, I’ve got data exaggerated-ers, I’ve got conspiracy nuts think world-wide effort end Presidents career, I’ve got people taking kids theme parks, planes, beach need live best life can’t live fear, I’ve got people threatening get guns take street “gubment can’t tell do.” social sphere. knew couple nutty family members, I’ve found recently few, including friends. stepped away suggesting inject bleach ourselves.

And yet still impeached grounds mentally unfit. 

I blame Sue Collins. Congratulations calculating completely irrelevant metric. fact explain even Chile worst metric, Sweden still worse Chile, proves point. 

Now, organised campaign Chile’s response covid, sure would see metric spelled capital letters news headlines world. seems metric relevant want bash Sweden. 🤣 It’s saying something say worst thing I’ve seen/read since started. say, I'm rare proud moment CT keeping numbers low. people glare ones refuse cover nose mask too. Ooooh. want drive around car like that! get prize, guy giving prize says ""too bad get September"" hedging me, anyone else getting real ""I Legend"" vibe news? Better start pulling bootstraps would standard US healthcare model. going poor covid 19 raging you? Best university world.  told trickled though see offer alternative, since know best delivery method drug they're testing. probably contact correct mistake. Seriously, would hardly call we’ve done winning. fair don’t know winning could even looked like. Probably best could hope get in, kill every taliban find lock country except humanitarian aid via full nato support. Nation building doesn’t work. really think govt huge disservice open honest obesity.

They running commercials day begging people lose weight. Yeah might well bend take it... bring heat change happens. Nobody ever got anything accomplished maintaining status quo. 

Whats decent life dead relative something preventable? Whats decent life going respiratory therapist chronic condition ventilator? Yea fuck doctors absurd claims based years education experience! Exactly.

Just know, probably going get downvoted. got downvoted... feeling unemployed people... sure... lol. we're even saying get money, want little bit too.. lol obviously idea going fail succeed neither anyone else. One candidate failed Phase III [two weeks think dangerous talk like we're going back normal one trial joining 3 others Phase III. Well, it’s trial. get sarcasm. lot types trial US pay small amounts participants... unlikely case. much want see asap, I’d rather wait see Nolan’s film big screen. know really vaccine soon people seem think will. While, think that's wonderful idea... necessarily legal? get paid oncall time? seems like overreach employer free time. like precedent sets, even corona. Like, could make weekend trip, even miss work! I've definitely done two day vacation before, lot travel one day ""vacation"" really enjoy driving and/or airports vacation me. :) filopodia seem likely contribute syncytial formation (as MHV) and, said, pulmonary restructuring (as seen RSV). I'm unfamiliar followup testicular infection except comprehensive analysis China early on, reference?

Looking bit, seems filopodia capable cell-to-cell spread absence appropriate attachment factors MHPV. measles, different manner cell-to-cell spread apparently capable causing spread neurons express MV receptors. seems possible least could undetected viral invasion spread within particular cell type lacks characteristics typical binding via filopodia associated SARS-CoV-2, overall cell-to-cell infection mechanisms seem poorly understood.

Persistent measles viral replication brain following acute infection resulting subacute sclerosing panencephalitis seems like relevant model neutralization-avoidant cell-to-cell infection causing delayed death. Comforting far virus yet found CSF patients neuronal symptoms, perhaps makes sense neuronal replication occurring via cell-to-cell interface?

FIPV also seems achieve systemic infection leading delayed mortality via neutralization avoidance; case, FECV acquires macrophage tropism, perhaps via differential protein expression response FECV proteomic mechanisms, upon exposure antibodies viral reproduction systemic infection via infected macrophages takes off. case neutralizing antibodies actually promote viral macrophage infection complement binding receptors (a recent paper Cell proposes similar mechanism COVID-19) since they're unable neutralize antigen. looking another topic dive into, look beyond respiratory pathology underlying viral mechanisms, see many similarities FIP &amp; COVID-19 bring fascinating considerations toward differential pathology observed: pure speculation reviewing recent paper showing COVID-19 autoantibodies CSF + IgG-associated neuronal staining immunofluorescence, wonder autoantibodies might actually play beneficial role selectively targeting antibody-evading infected cells. We'll probably know my
lifetime interesting idea!  chy-na Hard get public buy guy said opposite thing couple months ago someone said: “The USA Florida earth!” different America? state country? understand rioting, one entitled endanger fellow citizens lose support. 

 protesters article riot, think majority country side even share purposes serious dangerous thing rally behind. 

 I've dissenter powers long time I'm willing throw molotovs bricks yet.

 Like said, last resort think going make opponents powerful situation diminish credibility have. foreign America understand thinks time nothing do, hope come correct willing sacrifice whole hell lot. ChadOX1 vaccine v. virgin unboosted/untrained immune response... know US also developed vaccine basically stage Oxford vaccine right...? Dexamethasone. UK recovery trial 


Peer Reviewed Paper:  
Easy read BBC article subject:  


Basically UK centralised hospital system (the NHS) run absolutely massive trials hospitals across country. They're testing around 7 different treatments 10k+ people enrolled. Dexamethasone one them. Cuts deaths third ventilator death rate 10% overall. guess good mine. neighborhood relatively large police presence. see cops drive past unmasked people time drive right past like regular ass day nothing bad happening. unmasked aware they're safe kind punishment.

My apartment building signs literally everywhere saying cannot enter building without mask, heavy implication may evict following guidelines. Yet 70% 30 crowd walks around lobby without masks on. Often right past elderly. nothing quite like image group unmasked 21 year olds laughing yelling walk past 80 year old woman using walker wearing mask. private security never once, I've seen, even told ""Hey, need wear mask."" stare phones ignore whole thing. I'm even sure they're paid do. get free whenever post #BLM #Justice4Breonna IG story, hell would pay tracking device injection instead? didn’t; ascribed population compliant. Scotland small population whole Central Belt densely populated large outbreak could disastrous. People abiding social distancing rules, wearing masks, generally following government advice. England Scotland’s governments pretty much aligned lockdowns, bar minor differences (and different countries air-bridge schemes). President openly anti-science America’s detriment - he’s killing people, two ways it. thing people zero symptoms get tested going quarantine 2 weeks results come back. Lose-Dixie, Win... best healthcare world feels like tell saved 6 mo income making coffee home. 

Sure. Let's take Starbucks. long menu, sake argument let's say Vente (or whatever call large) $4 USD tax tip. One per day.

At Walmart, bag ground (and make fair, I'm using overpriced Starbucks again) make 16 costs $6.50. better. Let's add buck filters, sugar, creamer.  $.47 per day.

So make own, that's 4 - .47 = 3.53/day savings.  Times 365 = (I twice believe it) $1,288.45 per year.  drink two day, double it. 

That's 6 months income sure. nice start probably have. I'll pass. guys try instead. God help us smallpox gets freezer. think US use vaccine profitable enough. think second shutdown come *unless* healthcare resources completely used people start dying appendicitis, heart attacks, asthma attacks, uncontrolled diabetes, etc. Even see group says ""it left individual much risk willing take, state"".

Two people know vocal advocates opening state schools nurses. worry pandemic burned summer.... word ""household"" key. looked up, median household income US \~60k. Sounds *so* bad, break numbers. Assuming household two working adults, debts (student loans, medical, etc.), adult taking home $30k annual salary pretty bad.

If live expensive area, jobs pay 30k annual salary, looking MUCH higher rents housing costs. vary lot, I'm even gonna factor here.

Medical expenses also astronomical, especially people chronic conditions (my best friend pays $1,500/mo prescriptions manage Crohns disease, feasible drop $10k ""stock up"" doomsday scenario). Per CNBC, Americans spend average $5k/year health costs. (Again, remember $60k/mo per HOUSEHOLD statistic, person house medical expenses.) third Americans owe $10k medical bills.

And household young children, looking average cost $10k/YEAR childcare.

Then there's student loans--in 2016, Americans took loans college borrowed average $37,172. Factoring interest jazz, 10-year repayment plan, that's payments $382/mo ($4,584/yr).

So two-adult household--who bring home $60k collectively--you're looking $10k medical expenses, $10k childcare (for 4 5 years, parents work need someone watch kid til go school), $10k student loans.

That leaves $30k/year, TWO PEOPLE, rent/mortgage, gas, groceries, car payments, car insurance, utilities, living expenses family might include 1 children.

So uh, yeah, think canceling $7/mo Netflix account, buying $600 phone every 3 years, gonna help much. thanks advice, luv :)

Sources numbers:    mean wage labor?   Aug 21st says ever need someone talk to, DMs open, I've pretty isolated would good talk someone :) everything back normal? Canada. agree wholeheartedly. Wow, last sentence really gave goose pumps! 
This pandemic horrible thing probably negatively effected nearly every human planet - man, thought people world passionately rooting single cause amazing. Hahaha oh goodness. people crack up. literally got smiling, dude. Made hour. meet sometime. Alfie Oakes? Yeah, exactly... if? That's thing, know. None us do. I'm epidemiologist either, real one might tell us completely impossible herd immunity 7 months it. Best plan accordingly worst case scenario. That's happens literally every time take field. usually due virus, grim reality football either way.  Failed ofsted I’m sure feel way. feel people hysteria prone. actually anti masks cov-i-d-i-o-t-s population wise usa. see first graph link mask wearing lower usa, higher uk, australia, denmark bottom list Completely agree. Government criticised maintaining store PPE limited shelf-life. maintained store £m year never used would criticised. Here, seems like sensible move likely rather dynamic demand driven market, people going criticise signing up. Well, people go back queue vaccine handed out. France. saying going country legal make okay. wonder people got idea? 1000 people tested young, healthy volunteers pre-existing conditions. people virus going problem even get it. Q vaccine work older people pre-existing conditions virus deadly. Wow. hope comment sarcastic. saddest perception reality read today. Place bets went. Lmao Exactly. find amazing can’t follow death rates shorter notice. hard could be? Doesn’t matter. spun positive light Trump boast plan along hard fought get vaccine American people. course bullshit base doesn’t care lap up. company needs reported health department ASAP. Please expose asses. whistle-blower protection laws!

I would never hesitate care burn bridges it. Yeah, I'm certainly expecting actually going held accountable. They're difficult time hiding malfeasance, poor things. government fact already pay 500 Euros essential. government also already get largely control Germany. need wait.

It's ""under control"", takes one case growth exponential. long Germany sustain current economic model? One year? Two? Three? Four?

What 500 euro get contract COVID die - US paid $1200 apiece regardless job, people put work given additional amount $800 $1200 per week. get us stay home...

A payroll tax holiday discussed, unlikely considering needs takers.

I'm waiting. Like said, I'm living life literally different before. Happy. Healthy. fear like you. football practice? working weight room, indoors, together, without masks? Haha annoying women called Karen. Haha. Clever! vaccine trials going underway Perth Brisbane? similar boat too? That's correct. help little bit higher positivity situations, say, 20% positive, cuts test volume 15%.

For big impact, want lower positivity. pooling cut test volume 50%, need 7% lower positivity, using pools 3 4 positivity.

It helps samples marked rough idea positivity handled differently. lab getting screening samples say, basketball team, makes sense use big pool since they're expected positive. hand, someone previously positive retesting check clearance, probably make sense pool all. Germany really wants skilled labor too... don’t put onus all. poster asking see black representation Hollywood. answering question. something truthful doesn’t make correct moral. Yes Hollywood racist. Yes Hollywood pretends focus diversity surface level. Especially look behind scenes. Yes, onus Hollywood change. problem haven’t shown willingness change unless they’ve pushed unfortunate reality things. great good insight something not, ever claimed be, knowledgable in

Maybe put effort original claims people wouldn’t question them? figured scientists you’d know back claims rather wait questioned it. 

There’s great insight you. You’re acting like got one reality provided research needed stop point unfounded speculation. thanks friend. universal, virulent. majority left-leaning electorate. history American support dictatorships (not Ecuador...but continent,) funding encouraging civil wars, training brutal military police School Americas, economic exploitation environmental destruction, treatment Ecuadorian immigrants States...there's long list grievances. Even Monroe Doctrine bit insulting seen S. American eyes. Except elites vacation Miami send kids US universities, impossible love States.

Edit ad: Plus, tons Americans moved here. great, loud-mouth assholes. assholes get noticed. You’ve there? bucket list? [Update Google page calling masks ""Mostly Way early get excited anything comment unnecessarily flippant. assume interact people real life way. can’t imagine pre-school costing college education. know comment thread talking Benjamin Franklin right? world continues play reverse Robin hood   endangering employees... really good news? I’m smart don’t want get hopes nothing die, die. Please allocate resources young competent. Let fools go. China right keep people homes.  don’t, uneducated prediction.

Ok great got  #1 - likely proceed second booster. true COVID vaccines trial, small pox polio vaccine

Smallpox Polio **great** examples diseases would much prefer develop immunity vaccine actually catching.

Thank proving point.  Good points. It’s also funny i’m constantly wearing mask, so, even though i’m mean mugging, may even able tell! Haha! again, it’s completely cathartic. Also, close making comments past weekend anti mask wearers tired pregnant don’t feel like getting it, like said, really don’t want engage stupid, pointless situation change ways.  TFW control group get diabetes came conclusion based production vaccines already starting. already hundreds millions doses manufactured already. waiting approval trials. None century. ...

The weight room. Idiots using confined, indoor space specifically designed deep, heavy breathing.

This drives crazy. 90% things want take time reasonable precautions. could football kept outdoors taken reasonable precautions. Instead YOLO’d whole thing like idiot get nothing gonna go away, like miracle.

please hold miracle.

we're sorry, we're currently experiencing higher-than-normal prayer volume. please stay line, miracle connect soon becomes available Haha remember decision made. seem remember toplessness non-commercial purposes only? True. assumed safety already least somewhat determined Phase trials leading candidates, suppose longer-term safety still questionable. invention antibiotics 21st century last time checked. different information? confuses TN test results back 25 minutes. widespread places? axe! lol. People shouldn’t struggle living minimum wage. That’s shouldn’t low. you’re talking Fauci’s original stance masks explained multiple times proven true imo.

People currently still selfish assholes. would’ve hoarded important limited PPE frontline workers needed.

Also - point OP making that, overwhelmingly, type people refuse wear masks tend type people wouldn’t take advice black man. Exactly want get banned yeah, soft, vague language Indeed, pointed article linked!  Yeah highschool dropouts arnt brainless asure you, us got taken advantage man forces leave school freinds family. still wearing mask. dock workers deal truckers coming hot spots? guy coughing place, tell get back truck. disagreeing that, I'm saying wording different better reflect realities disease. 

There's big difference ""Covid kill us all"", ""Covid kill us"", ""Covid kill us"" ""Covid kill us"". 

Language important avoid giving paranoia.  Bro, get USA. 
Even i'm (a shitshow country) masks mandatory since quarantine began, march. live? live Midwest city people wearing masks now. downplay seriousness 94 year old grandfather got made normal recovery. Try take one day time.  whole lot dead people................. legal though. upheld supreme court early 1900s. know name case, however.

Edit: Jacobsen v Massachusetts. Talks vaccination enforced relevant masks. Also 10th amendment allows states create laws specifically outline feds. since federal government said anything masks, states legal right mandate masks, also claim emergency question it. 

So yes, completely legal USA mandate mask wearing, despite triggered conservatives say. Lmao literally enough jobs right 40M unemployed people. Stop moron.   Makes sense.

Racists aren’t usually date people... Pfft, think Norwegians go US treatment? talk, afford life saving treatment yourself, even country. I'm 100% sure see disinformation campaigns start social media.  ""I know someone got vaccine hospital can't walk""  ""My friend got vaccine terrible pain over""   ""The vaccine contains trace amounts dihydrogen monoxide. Everyone ever eventually died"". like precedent sets... Republicans fucking stupid comes this. Even dad wears mask everywhere gets mad whenever sees someone wearing one properly think government make masks mandatory ""they can't enforce it"". Even point places we've masks required way people wearing refuses change mind. top /r/leopardsatemyface shit. I’m NY. better awhile expect second shutdown here. NY careful re-opening numbers show that, plus peaked early. People sub continuously broad stroke USA Covid dumpster fire bunch morons. Yes, areas concerning virus growth poor mask compliance, places well regards well. I’m sorry poor compliance area, April, NY got control, NJ. believe half mandatory mask policy 3 states type mask policy all. certain people wearing masks specifically spite people like you. bad thing, partially fault. persuasive abrasive, condescending, rude people. Instead, could, IDK, try strategy persuasion. could work, might make feel less provide evidences back misinformation, wear mask protect others!

I also, point said ""You wear mask"", (unless closely read wrote) wrote retort 'misinformation', confuses me. #BuildTheWall English language rich variations pronunciation, even modern life media tend homogenize degree.

We thank sprawling British Empire that, English native speakers dispersed across continents. release vaccine America somehow one wants get it. Inertia property matter  Well thus far single confirmed re-infection. 

It speculation point side effects normal vaccine, everytime get flu shot, get side effects listed covid vaccine. doctor, no, vaccine help people who've already it, seems another breakthrough treatment currently ventilators it:  Let put better context.

I live Philippines. means great job handling pandemic. intents purposes, shit-show here. BUT... masks mandatory. Social distancing mandatory. establishments can't open without making sure comply necessary protocols. There's mask politics going whatsoever. Mask laziness sure, politics. Compare US look pretty fucking great.

Also, let's look another highly developed country: Japan. one day US recorded 70,000 additional cases. That's 1 day. Total Japan? 20,000. Deaths? even 4 digits. Outbreak confirmed January 16. Nationwide state emergency ended May 25. know why? without Coronavirus, people wear fucking masks! .""As last August, reportedly ""lone statewide official takes lobbyist gifts.""

If passes peer review, matter who's source scientific discovery. revisited post hours less before. Kept coming back 10 times next minute, place. Sounds like explained it. Thanks! true. Didn’t forget cause never knew. information I’ve cared learn CDC, John Hopkins, WHO, legitimate medical review journal. get literally zero info news won’t even bother doesn’t citations linked directly experts.

Honestly care best family catch it. people offended mask? bad. It’s them. people don’t wanna wear one? Ok. won’t go near them. It’s frustrating us want get back normal, we’ll deal it. Ya life, think right. long respect boundaries I’ll respect yours. ask people don’t want social distance protect don’t force way onto me. Thats plenty reasonable. *We like party!*

*We like, like party!*

*We like party* Absolutely, Sadly, think numbers we're getting political purposes, Hospitals blindly taking money comes case. take first flight Fuckoffneyland Normal vaccines usually use either dead suppressed viruses induce immune system create antibodies virus. comes (very small) risk infection.

The mRNA vaccine injects virus's mRNA uses induce antibody creation.

Definitely skipped *ton* details, that's big picture. U.S.A. NUMBER 1! promoting tourism, promoting tourism place like Branson appeals mostly older people. needing consent

They need consent, said report ""if"" sought hospital treatment, allowed see it. think wearing masks alone would suddenly save us feel me. I’ve calling wankers. one question. 


If one Vaccine reaches final stage gets approved mass produced, mean rest vaccine efforts stopped? Could 2,3 4 vaccines available governments people use given point?

How work? Omg sad  America? We're making worse decisions handling it. plenty rednecks there. don’t notice one them.  I'm 100% versed it, believe another contributing factor Oxford vaccine using Adenoviral vector Adenovirus vaccines already use, albeit they're usually distributed military. knew /r/gardening worth joining ! wish grew bigger potatoes instead little red ones :-( Bullshit.

Oh thanks info,

From heard gov looking open schools September. Currently many open rotation children only. However, said, never know gov might u turn especially considering inconsistent is. example, restaurants smaller confined places open - yet wedding receptions usually open could implement structured seating capped 30 people. someone broke lockdown relate. Badman! Good, hope boycott mission accomplished keep anti maskers away rest us shop essentials know many teachers would be? going train replace time fall? Let's even get fact need income Funny picked two examples. Bookstores Sephoras reopened NYC recently, first two places everyone household ""needed"" rush last week. Heh. Indian introvert here, absolutely loved complete absence honking clean air here. Nature show us big mirror. Yep, exactly thoughts well. bots conspicuous top, I'm wondering Russian troll factory St. Petersburg working overtime. still work antibodies lasting months? die he'll lie bad use survived support ndb narrative. I'm American too, living part country people compliant local regulations (masks, distancing). 

One problem people view COVID nation-wide thing whereas need view several different localized outbreaks. situation New York different situation Florida, example. believe already started production vaccine assumption works. makes sense, better waste money find vaccine work waste months ramping production.

Especially vaccine delivered even healthcare workers October/ November would massively helpful heading winter second wave covid. Thanks asking. personally think it’s overblown. States reducing death counts survival rate high. think it’s dangerous rush vaccine know side effects could way worse virus itself. Like Fauci said everyone responds well vaccines. scares me. think good time people wake eat better poor health US major reason worse countries. though? Canadian lived Toronto moving Vancouver couple weeks ago. I'd say 50% wear masks grocery store. 

I think many Canadians politicizing masks attacking people wanting wear masks, lot simply care wear to, places businesses. guess world damned do, damned Anyone details timeline manufacturing distribution, assuming September vaccine approved general population? went Walmart today, despite sign outside said ""Masks required entry"", would say least third people still wearing them. dumbing sounded like know talking about. Yes true main component would technically genetic info spike protein SARS virus inserted onto viral vector template. Side effects could occur would already occurred past studies viral vector used MERS ebola. Plus, whole reason VAERS keep track adverse effects vaccines they're put onto market. cannot sit twiddle thumbs follow patients trial years see develop (most likely) extremely rare side effects disastrous pandemic right now. mean come  friend friend waited long get checked started losing lots weight, back March, three months live colon cancer. Hell yeah! stock photo really adds dramatic effect here.

Look angle guys, like scientist CUSP breakthrough. 

Seriously though, stop trying sell drug like it’s viagra. “On track” isnt something say 2020. bunch morons convinced response pandemic, matter minor, unacceptable limitation freedoms.

Check video 2 dudes trying hand masks Huntington beach California getting completely shutdown locals. get feel badly COVID going fuck us America.  could wrong knowledge immune system limited, lack antibodies indicate respective cells produce antibodies disappeared well. know that's happening covid memory b cells t4 cells stick around years even though actual antibodies present serum gone. Syringes hard mass produce; need tons syringes, make them. take time (though much) update factory procedures remove bottlenecks run 24/7, takes time get brand new machinery factory needed. 

It's roughly easy make syringes make retractable ballpoint pens (they exactly comparable, gives good sense complexity production), nation probably goes tens millions per month, 100 million.

Hell, probably go least 300 million pairs shoes per year (mostly made China, need produce everything locally), shoes far complex. they're good comparison essentially everyone developed world least 1 pair shoes. Huh? I'm even seeing phase III even began AZ vaccine. vaccine, named ChAdOx1 nCoV-19

Chad-Ox.. really? Poland? Hopefully! really help Trumps re-election chances people see hard worked get US.  usually reason test someone positive . Negative predictability pretty bad (last checked) test multiple times sure person symptomatic. 5 people getting tested, 2 pop positive first time three get 3 tests one positive. That's 3 positive tests among 5 people reporting 3 postive tests 11. crossed busy roads kid. Right...but problem essential businesses pose much higher risk since everyone uses essentially little control. Also classify businesses “essential” individual location necessary. location could shut cluster cases tied obeying ordinances enforcing masks especially, businesses might take precautions. point case people report feeling safe Disney Universal grocery store public generally? Something wrong picture; it’s “too big fail” argument.

Stores employees whose job ensure customers stay distant, people wearing masks, also provide hand sanitizer entrance, least. transparent whether employees tested positive many tested positive. probably things do, basic things. really need retest positive patients. keep testing people symptomatic rule false negatives.

I think problem there's multiple negative tests people vast majority people test positive get tested again.  Believing capable spreading fast adults dumbest idea entire covid's first wave. I'm honestly goddamn disappointed took long figure maybe studied baseless clearly absolutely moronic statement. Way go. read possible scenario new vaccines risky older people compromised immune systems haven’t quite dialed side effects risk factors healthy people may better suited first productions. HCQ shown work (help people survive get better slightly faster) certain populations certain severity illness. isn’t prophylactic.

But wearing masks thing started Plandemic video. People close jumped Q-Anon train awhile back saw Plandemic really fucking fun trying figure hell they’re even thinking anymore isn’t rational thought process.

Where conversations go seriously reminds dealing online trolls.

I hate universe. construction, little heavy lifting. 

Just says, need know use basic tools, Heath insurance contribution available, matched retirement contribution, must able work outside, overtime available, experience preferred required. Call details. 

It's healthy work place support many families. dozen current employees us least 2 years. We're growing, need get trucks road, need employees want grow company. little contact anyone except co workers. Perfect job stay away virus besides working home. 

Normally little trouble getting applicants.  entire interview complete dumpster fire. Know best part science is? adjusts views based evidence. Maybe could adjust bit more. enough money tell politicians let open up.

Probably help Florida state income tax, need figure somewhere get money, Disney tourism look mighty juicy. lot times it’s choice coming sick firing you. It’s bag dicks everyone getting laid. don’t get say act complete. That's risk pedophile leaders willing take! US, pedophile leaders going total peasant purge achievement. Found fantasy football player Black market sales poor can't afford $10k proper version cost USA.

Never mind birth defects Yep, entire US population hypothetically vaccinated November coronavirus would disappear news cycle two weeks. Trump would definitely benefit. I'll believe see it. Great idea! forget max people's credit cards based think dollar transaction. shouldn’t to. You’re right. that’s hand dealt. Always play hand we’re dealt. one wish had. That’s waste time, point, point comes risk death. worth it. Facts. tell 1% fuck put mask on? 100% agree, media reporting COVID-19 death autopsy he's already tested negative. frustrating, kids get sick die every day diseases infections. could false positive, know autopsy lazy reporting provides conclusion. reason skeptical everything read. Fauci March 8th: claim ""hE pReSeRvInG pPE"". say ""use cloth masks bandanas""? know though? Cloth masks shit. don't. Wear cloth mask go hang dry wall. particles 10-20 times *larger* coronavirus...and still end inside *approved* masks. (And even talked fact eyes susceptible avenue infection) Take that, boomers   keep deflecting every country world got virus China. single one responded poorly government. China started pandemic, leaders made crisis today. someone State relatively better yes, does. travel bans, rules quarantining traveling state inconsistent frankly country whole handling everything shame country. 

Also reporting outside US general world reporting world care Florida lot new cases Massachusetts US overall government failings. ALso whenever talking Covid multifaceted issue vs. states mask requirements problem country wide issue, state wide. slow anything pitiful relief citizens small businesses.  save time.

husband wife 2 kids... one test (**at lab**).. still 4 swabs.

&amp;#x200B;

it saves reagents. 

if 4 test negative, they're ""done""

They shown us make required whole damn country mask up. test many possible quarantine infected.

This definitely one history books. Yes. seeing correlate best given way need extrapolate data. Without Deaths properly related person Covid infected, person died complications Covid, data correlate, mortality rate higher told, honestly it’ll probably children children’s children know exact impact pandemic.

Minor inconvenience worst. “I don’t wear condom birth rate country low.” think pandemic propagates? won’t. Yeah pretty much. Even besides turning Corona party political issue culture war, incompetence US government truly staggering.

I suppose us already forgot it, also worst possible coordination federal government states procurement supplies. feds essentially said ""everyone themselves"" states outbid other. start cease parts supply deliveries literally caused states hijack deliveries hide secret locations. straight grotesque dystopian comedy. actually lot masks restrict breathing much. 

You look little find one.

Most masks perfect anyway. slightly looser one would stifle forward projected droplets better mask all.

-Aristotle Idk statistics you’re reading always believed best case scenario, encouraging see still discussed possibility far process. said, initial test came back negative, despite fever 103 tested followed 9 days fever, chills, aches, etc. told consider positive test given known produce false negative 1 3 times (I also received standard flu test came back negative). 

Not sure reliability tests, brain scratcher may actually accurate. Well one they’re free handouts, that’s money I’ve paying unemployment years. Florida cases minimal mid June. wasn’t issue all. Mandates put two weeks Florida started significant amount cases. 

We 11% overall positive test rating. NY testing 50% positive worst, lol. It’s war zone here. We’re wearing masks government instructs. sure else want. Easy say “lock down” it’s going lose everything lockdown. Ouch. seems real think lot countries said masks little effect worried supplies emergency workers beginning. 

But since studies shown could 85% reduction rate spreading wearing one encouraged much possible. difficult manufacture vaccine? pharmaceutical manufacturing plant relatively easily converted “instructions” shared? produced many facilities possible get ASAP. last school shooting? know talking about. Medical Doctors dont get PhDs... get MD...

PhD Latin philosophiae doctor.

Now MD could go get PhD like going school entire lives. (We call professional students, study forever never go actually apply said knowledge)

So cool. people call idiot dont even understand basic stuff like this. country highest per capita death rate today?

Chile. Sweden 18th.

Overall, Sweden 7th total deaths per capita, Chile number used propaganda purposes.

Not really... shows virus killing people right now. Sweden worst awhile, Chile is... Chile still long way go hits total per capita Sweden has... Chile's total per capita 20% lower Sweden's.

Keep justifying asshole, looks real good you. “First mask what’s next make us take vaccine” friend said day gave good laugh thought I’d share True story. 

People complacent day day shattered records even commenting news articles mentioning new heights “thats they’ve said every day week.”

And think everyone else sheep, it’s amazing. Probably also I’m going fly whatever country vaccine America sure hell won’t first round trip probably cheaper American pricing. Suggestion: Stay away Southern California, blatant disregard safety protocols getting worse, better. vacation wait. Nolan, sun rises falls Massive immediate cuts many programs way stop (or maybe significant wealth tax along measures).

You've got reversed. Driving debt deliberate attempt destroy social benefit programs. logical fix properly tax people wealth small countries. Canada would harm letting Americans in. tolerate racist fascist president using gestapo police force people oppose that??? cancer are, that’s you’ll get let in. Stay home folks! Wear mask!!! It’s simple! Reference news here, black lives matter Thank thought response. true, i'll mantain enough information know couple violated voluntary quarantine. threat force last resort, first thing go to. Hopefully come this. don’t want vaccine you’re fucking right?

No, that's understanding issue (although expert vaccines maybe one reading step offer more/better info). 

By understanding, eliminate disease population need high percentage people vaccinated. Meanwhile even vaccinated understanding mean 100% vaccinated longer get disease...in words vaccines always 100% effective. 

Furthermore, people legit allergy medical reasons vaccinated risk could vaccinate. 

tl;dr - Choosing vaccinate decision effects health. lol

My original comment joke. serious, let record show.  Plus feeling work saved lives helped humanity get back sense normalcy. welcomed friend almost anywhere world. can't wait cost $5000  RIP. true hero indeed. know whole lot vietnam, know US lose war Taliban... Even considering *2020*, I'd say that's ridiculous. Well done basement least that.
Edit: lol mean love downvotes cause well upset someone else basement hiding. want provide peer reviewed source notion New York simply ""burned out"" COVID-19 spread, I'm ears, something yet heard reliable source. Hell, even heard *hinted at* studies I've looked through. !RemindMe 1 hour simple issue me. circumstances schools forced open babysit children working parents.

Edit: realize 19 year old OP college age, I’m talking young children public schools. Hard say. Short term probably impact. Long term, recovery, see prices staying higher level goods.
Take food situation US. Pork, chicken, beef, seen price increases. drastic others Covid outbreaks plants demand issues. seen prices come back much since hike anticipate either time (if ever does).
Most problems stem much supply, enough demand.

I'm guessing stats look great days he's controls data. we'll get past this. us humans resilient adaptable creatures know he’s proponent free healthcare, seems like whatever popular. Train immune system lol. vaccine body naturally. Genius.... I'd bit nervous Mississippi vaccine. Call biased I'm sure I'd sign one :) organization vaccine/pharma agnostic could any. You’d likely know committing participate. Agreed, get part US procurement source vaccine. Astrazenca European company international scheme ensure fair spread across world one country buy supply. Unlike whole Remvisidar stuff, Trump can't control European companies supply EU labs. 

Just glad weakest world get fair shot first Nope Data participants received two doses (a booster 28 days first) showed good sustained neutralizing antibodies well strong T-cell response! good. 

Minimal expected side effects far, course need longer term immunogenicity data. Fatigue headache common. Also malaise, muscle aches, chills mild fever. commonly seen many (most?) vaccines. 

They currently Phase 3 expecting results fall year! much gonna cost me? asked throaway get it, like talking wall: ""They paid him!"" ""They want know that"" ""They harm people make product look bad!"" ""MMS gives oxygen body work better fixing itself""


Worst thing family believed him, bore show real videos make change mind.  TOTALLY redeems himself! go store voluntarily choosing enter, yet still act protest like petulant child. modified version already existing vaccine proven safe far fewer safety concerns compared vaccines hear lockdown didn’t really work out. Partly first lockdown early.  Yeah people refusing try get job right pay good. Thank you, yes! CTA rep recently told me, ""Do people remember thing called winter?"" Also, large campus definitely can't fit 800 students outside six feet apart providing adequate shade. competing sound systems teachers would require would make impossible hear instruction. Just, no, much no. Kids less likely show symptoms. mean virus asymptomatically mean capable spreading it. OP saying put situation spread around community yet. time read every one links, every kid community tested studies? Obviously there's less symptomatic cases children require sort medical attention even testing, mean can't spread others higher risks. I'm glad kids affected it, opening schools health affected, spread virus to. school day mass gathering links everyone community sends kid school. lot people. seen action yet, people worried. kids getting sick, virus spreading throughout community asymptomatically.   get COVID-19, will, they’re going hospitals. They’re going go home they’re going get it.”

We missing unavoidable side-effect ""But parents may not"", Mr. Governor working universal flu vaccine common cold vaccine. actually closer reality many think. 

The difficulty Flu/cold vaccines numerous viruses bacteria cause flu cold symptoms, universal idea little trickier compared coronavirus vaccine one causative agent: coronavirus 19. actually disproportionally affecting minorities urban voters typically lean Democrat.

IMO one main reasons GOP apparently trying spread virus faster. US get 300 million minus one Trump can’t get it? Even n95 people need proper precautions. Hand sanitizer, washing hands, touching face / mask. masks, social distancing still important previous things still apply. Cloth masks still help, excuse crowd areas, stop hand sanitizing, throw caution wind. husband needed go bathroom HD nearby can't justify whatever want using turgid pile gibberish it’s always Black man White man ? indian, asian, arab, mexican. 

Fuck hollywood racist selective bullshit. We're far uncharted territory stuff here... highly motivated.... knows what's possible. I'm expert matter, gleaned articles. went lockdown flatten curve keep hospitals getting overwhelmed, achieved. lockdown eradication. American individualistic attitudes fucking blight society. I'm sorry hear struggle. affects diabetics worse ... count? insurers, would loop? NYC warning unique case. spreading silently weeks blew up.  People thought cold, flu, whatever turned covid. started tests people already sick symptoms. 

Plus population density high NYC, spread crazy. saw start outbreak, late outbreak, given know came Europe (and US states, even) NYC.

So instead ensuring another NYC happen, people watching one build, like watching water pull beach tsunami, saying death rate staying low!

EDIT: Also, lot medical lessons learned NYC, Italy, England. better treatment protocols then. People likely less likely die. There's two things can't stand world: intolerance people's cultures. Dutch. probably healthy experience understand boredom cure yourself, honestly. Amen. wanna see friends, man.

Since March, I’ve lost job, moved back US gone year half, moved started new job, living myself. 

I go days without speaking another person sometimes. I’m super, super extroverted person, too. It’s tough. I’m tearing thinking light end tunnel. live UK, it’s manufactured UK company US involvement. accidental, UK government going way avoid US bullshit this.

Same UCL got crying, we're even. Well, except I'm work :) wonder Ducey likes state we’ve use surge capacity. neglects say AZ using adjoining states’ resources instead. you’re famous let it. Pretty sure america would agree get football basketball (all sports) back TV delays vaccines others couple days worth lol. really, continue regular careers 40s athletes that's rare buddy. Well seems general consensus. Many expressed there's denying feeling moment.

However would nice see events somehow miraculously bring everyone together higher powers overthrow them. Maybe usa well known asian country...only time tell... would make sense corona feeds sugars. Would explain it’s spreading well US. inb4 people ignoring guidelines say “sEe biG dEaL” it’s Well, call large sample size. would anyone listen take opinion seriously don’t even know name program you’re criticizing?  Enabling Act basically gave Hitler legislative power. Patriot Act not. Patriot Act definitely gave executive branch power (amending probable cause, secret searches / surveillance), amend constitution still bound it.

Of course step towards Fascism. argue pretty much act gives executive branch power step towards Fascism. Yeah anyone considering, keep mind volunteer ticket get vaccine first. might even work, might work temporarily, might side effects, it’s guinea pig benefit human race risk attached there’s reason test things first looking Fauci advising March opposite. meant comment bottom heart humanity’s gene pool day smidge. Maybe though virtuous need lecture steer away dick. Thank valued input. also pregnant, ass. can’t restrictive pregnant water retention much thing. majority people U.S. qualify overweight make things better.

I overweight, active, still concerned seen people affected illness. weird question, would order 34k tests people country? lot illegals theyre trying account for, planning distribute neighboring countries? recently given privledge, Chicago pulling back opening. different research groups working COVID19 vaccines. Placing ""an order 100 million doses"" one group reminds far much [ferry Wow one million!! enough top .01 percent. can’t wait first get untested vaccine hasn’t even proven work preventing COVID safe.  thing here. lax indeed, es bueno mi amigo, means skyrocket matter weeks. 

We'd better following New Zealand example ask me. 2-4 weeks everything right rain. care say back early February, shame I've 100% accuracy rate far. think that's first time ever I've right anything, so, know, little weird :) rural Missouri, one county mine, highly intelligent folks (/s) planning protest. Facebook post says ""Wear red shirts red hats, masks!"" plan burning masks. God help us all. kind long-term problems talking caused virus still body, vaccine help.

A bad viral infection lead issues like immune system over-reacting harming body, opportunistic bacterial infection. take long time recover from, even virus gone.

If helps, imagine virus like fire. someone sets fire, might injuries cause problems long time fire gets put out. but, freedoms stake! dare anyone try steal non-existent freedoms. Staying stupid joining mass rallies much fun. hahaha Stop propaganda. correctly informed positive numbers matter themselves. 

Why like this? 

How supposed learn better attitude? Say thanks modify behavior moving forward. 

Jesus. Texan taking seriously - I'm deeply sorry number Texans assholes acting pandemic exist. hope loved ones safe. ""large scale trials "" already started Except AstraZeneca (the Oxford vaccine company) 4% today (on day market largely up). Moderna also 12% today. Pfizer 25% ATH. Sooo....not exactly skyrocketing.  Yeah yeah, I'm lifelong American say fuck America too. that's discussion. spine see Chinese running effective disinformation demoralization campaign. doormat foreign political goals help. They've able piggyback Americans' general self-loathing horrible response control narrative beginning. People like you, mean offensive, called ""useful idiots"". really interesting. Thanks. probably win one. assume would logic applied applied Jonas Salk invent anything new. applying old techniques new virus. guys mRNA virus would probably win prove works though. suspect, ""news"" comes right AstraZenica released news vaccine. Imagine medical community hand't held hostage two months right wing media forcing study shitty malaria drug history anti-viral action could get looking actual modern anti-viral drugs live Cali.. shit mandatory since day 1.. area EVERYONE wears them.. USA big country people different.. makes pp hard Literally opposite article every comment far itt stated. mocking perspective expressed ITT.  There's actually scene like Star Trek Next Gen. adds one's depression. really option right south, Houston heat index 110+ two straight weeks guess he’s saying politically pragmatic point, put moderates swing voters. don’t believe would veto he’s president matter says now. That’s politics! already looked takes emigrate new zealand..? expect get easier- hit hard virus, ""brain drain"" own, need go begging citizenry. Haha totally accurate, anti-vaxers stupid “research” Facebook. anti-vax sister never vaccinated daughter, poor girl always sick, it’s terrible. price vaccine $5000 US. deductible. one hypotheses virus originated bat, mutated modern SARS-CoV-2 infecting single miner. necessary mutations happened single human being, remains virus frozen accidentally infect human 2019.

What understand is: different zoonotic hypothesis? words, takes bat virus completely adapt humans bat infect single human being, process taken place 2019 rather back 2012?

Edit: intended serious question, instead response got downvote. Get facebook shit here. time stop joining kinda stuff. Depending gullible one is, one might interested fish farm Iowa too. near Oxford know several people who've signed it. They're made EXTREMELY aware risks. It’s real life DLC. Haha commenting another post last night saying thing. Always wanted go New Zealand Australia I’d good both. can't wait get America unbelievably stupid reason. So... vaccine agree troll accounts often much sophisticated one. porque los dos? Less sophisticated accounts still useful part information warfare arsenal, they're cheaper, abundant, expendible. Sure, get called often, negate usefulness meantime.

Edit - unlikely professor smart azz state sponsored troll smartazz. doubt confusion end goal disinformation strategies. reason we're challenge trials vaccine candidates yet?

I get deliberately infecting people raises eyebrow come now. Every week process dragged out, tens/hundreds thousands new infections occur. We're choosing allow massive number organic infections avoid hundred deliberate ones? That... seem ethical me. Especially since hundred deliberate signed up. tremendously sad reflection today's world reading quote gave good chills. I'm truly shocked, best way, least ONE superintendent country making decision think realize supply logistics completely irrelevant. approved vaccine. made Phase III means nothing.  also rare minimum wage jobs even offer full time positions would need pay insurance. places cut 19.5 hours whatever legal threshold benefits state.

On top that, try work 2 part time jobs, lot minimum wage employers vary schedule weekly could end scheduled shifts make impossible juggle anything else. dose:  157 ELISA units \[EU\], 96–317; n=127  dose:  639 ELISA units \[EU\], 360–792; n=10

It looks like booster dose may recommended. thanks, really nice you. appreciated know &lt;3 I’m sure trump find way prevent shipped US unless put name Yee haw!

[^(Send ^(|) [^(Github - ^(|) [^(Github - Chrome point 25% positive rate RANDOM population. complete random, yes we'd wasting tests. 
However 2-3 people coming getting tested together (something think agree thats happening within friend circles).
Again maybe group 4 isnt perfect number. Maybe 3. random math works scenario.

My entire point batch testing better batch testing long calculate appropriate batch number. 

At end day, we're going ANYWHERE near Wuhan level efficiency high positive rates

Edit: I'll give example real possibility. 2 families 4 go get test. First family 0 positive. Second 2 positives. Thats 25% positive rate 8 people. Batch testing - 1 test first family, 5 tests second family. 6 tests total vs 8 needed individually. show positive tests much likely grouped together among clusters. much margin error think go 3 batch tests something.

Also cant batch test Texas/Arizona/PARTS CA mean start batch testing everywhere else. 1 part Hydroxychloroquine, 1 part bleach, 1 part sunlight. need stupid science men figure out. ELI5 “Russia stole vaccine research” mean anyway? one copy? spies break vials? beer battered gene tacos little ago. De.li.cious. won’t roll general public. Trump make sure Americans pay make friends even rich. Try KN95, seem less fog inducing even layers surgical mask. I’m though. I’d wear mask get flu too. sick sucks Wrong. US moderna Pfizer leading way. mRNA vaccines generated substantially better data oxford one, Pfizer best cell responses 3  produced US, produced AstraZeneca cost, cost either free cheap. No, UK vaccine likely need two doses data released today:

Single dose:

Booster dose:

median 639 ELISA units \[EU\], 360–792; n=10 Well article also 5 days old so..... Every time member GOP speaks, it’s another nail coffin. 

I feel sorry friends ‘think’ people right. 

Kemp Trump two badddddddd apples. realize even get vaccine 50% people infected, 1% fatality rate 1,650,000 people 20% 50% Americans need hospitalization

Only \~3% people COVID hospitalized. *Definitely* not...it mistake first time, gonna happen again. Yeah, Modi grand gestures. comes execution, falls ass backwards. Count USVI, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, St Barts, St, Vincent, St. Lucia, Barbados, Aruba. care anyone dies unless fetus politically useful them. That's gist, anyway. Dude protests good cause.It worth it.But visit grandmother murdered worse Hitler.At least thats people think.Whatever news say. Maybe fact actually reported several days ago. referring posted here, think overestimating much influence r/coronavirus markets. trial conducted double-blind placebo-controlled basis meaning neither researchers patients knew whether receiving SNG001 placebo. found number patients ended developing severe form disease - point required ventilation died - reduced 79% taking SNG001 compared placebo.

Not peer reviewed also trail vitro, actual patients. even that, common sense, everyone suffering together, basic care fellow man, wearing mask making huge fucking political problem Well Europe low birth rate replacement level. high taxation care retired people next 20-30 years going work long run unless increase immigration lot. learn anything horrific year 2020, please oh please, let this: 

It made ABUNDANTLY clear ills American society put public school system far long. Poverty needs another solution. Hunger, health, mental health, housing, childcare basic human needs, considered major issues ""the common welfare"" People. 

Just ""defunding police"" help lift horrific burdens police, jobs safely (and sanely) ""keep peace"", American public schools, public welfare system NEEDS restructured, schools focus QUALITY education youth, instead relying schools simply keep safe, fed, well-cared for. 

The pressure White House send students staff schools person sh*t-show made CRYSTAL CLEAR using schools simply boost economy. cost human life! BETTER!!! government ""leaders"" literally risking 6,000,000 American lives sake all-mighty dollar. That's mortality rate. ""ONLY"" 2% U.S. population. NOTHING keep us safe pandemic, let ""wash us"". Sorry wall-rant. 

TLDR: I'm effing scared angry current state Union, can't even see staight. Please vote. things get better we’ve got find different movie theater! is. red cross offering antibody testing blood donations now. positive follow plasma donation kids never attended forest school, get nature daily, even winter. collect worms, bugs, frogs. think lot exposed to, whether school out. Wish forest school readily available kids, least part school day, we’d many young people awareness actions impacting nature too. blame them. I've wishing Canada instead years now. Haha know right! It’s small world all!!  often wonder struggling isolation would handle actually getting sick. got sick mid-March. bad morning morning. woke wheezing pain. broke cried. remind positives. Although it’s slow going, I’m improving. I’m going avoid dishes instead get lost game Civ 6. Good old McAfee

Not quite source I’d using US going banned every country. really COVID19 control.  Yeah course.... it’s way find know - nothing done that. shame... oh well onwards upwards! Ish. Nope. I’m like morons you’re stereotyping thank much trying!

Edit. Maintenance home essential, done properly safely. ‘morons’ Home Depot entire quarantine bring family 5 buy potted plants mulch isn’t essential unsafe. Welp guess Virologist wife wrong

Only partially (or misunderstanding). saying correct influenza (to clear, fairly weak data there, that's certain, traditional consensus).

It appears true COVID-19 SARS-Cov-2 virus causes (again caution data still analyzed point final conclusions probably appear late year early next print). Why? really know yet, R-value observed places mandated masks addition measures (social distancing, contact tracing, etc.) appears reliably 1.

Early modeling results: Stutt, Richard OJH, et al. ""A modelling framework assess likely effectiveness facemasks combination ‘lock-down’in managing COVID-19 pandemic."" Proceedings Royal Society 476.2238 (2020): 20200376.

To quote one study, ""mask use decreases effective transmission rate nearly linear proportion product mask effectiveness (as fraction potentially infectious contacts blocked) coverage rate (as fraction general population), impact epidemiologic outcomes (death, hospitalizations) highly nonlinear, indicating masks could synergize non-pharmaceutical measures."" -- Eikenberry, Steffen E., et al. ""To mask mask: Modeling potential face mask use general public curtail COVID-19 pandemic."" Infectious Disease Modelling (2020). Sounds like right time help yourself... rising up, is. lot teachers nowadays actually hate thier job (especially HS Middle School teachers). know want live inside little happy positive bubble reality probably paid enough leave. choice (at least easy make be). 

Also let guess, think wearing mask choice "" Personal responsibility "". matter. biggest anti vaxxer hometown, goes every board ed meeting says telling kids vaccines helpful like teaching kids world flat, already webinars youtube studies flawed.  maga dipshit fucking destroying country. didnt like this. lot people could lives saved. People could also unified dealing virus leader idiot dictator.

He treating US like business nation supposed protect serve citizens country. America failing epically like shitty businesses. we're decreasing numbers. unlike NY lot states making masks mandatory worth. Yeah, wanted [controlled burn herd many cases short period time original goal. started pivot toward suppression / Test, Trace, Isolate late though. Sort of. complicated. another trump loving racist. Simple. today times easy educate yourself. Yeah ""vaporizing"" planes beside multi Camera angle crash tests example...

Watch Slowly surely, US isolating itself. Appeciate ideas. kind doing, people live hour away area spiking like entire state. one area takingbit seriously dont want expose anyone else since still work, everyone taking seriously there. sucks hopfully get good news soon. dont governments dont say airborne. even says airborne. would recommend outdoor classes Texas freaking August. Seriously. Kids might DIE. Kids tough fuck back then.

*When little boy New York City 1940s, swam Hudson River filled raw sewage. swam raw sewage. know… cool off. time, big fear polio; thousands kids died polio every year know something? neighbourhood, one ever got polio. one.

-George Carlin Twitter now. also “a friends grandparent’s death ruled covid didn’t covid can’t trust death count.” took entire company 24 hours get results back. July 14th. Florida.
It took 24 hours, 2 weeks prior July 2nd, get results back.
It took jobsite hours get laborers results back. least 40 people, 40 know got tested, within 24 hours Florida. Trump doesn’t know he’s doing. knows exactly he’s doing.

we know exactly he's doing:

losing You’re right. things need essential. States' rights rite. Yes, got test late last week told would take 7-10 days. know people waited 11 days results testing site. muh disney ! can't believe sell MAGA masks. could made bank, would safer. approval rating would higher... slam dunk. no. level outright malice complete disregard public health lead conclude *wants* tons people die, willing trade bunch guaranteed money ensure will... although maybe underestimate depth business ineptitude. said South rise again! guess meant rise corana cases.   People reporting wait 1-2 weeks test results. Also, demand well capacity, probably increasing. Add 1 week infection getting bad want tested see numbers beginning August. inflection point already passed, people see yet. EU accepts FDA clinical trials, accepted here, it’s accepted  shit ain't constant. ain't even linear. poster said, unfortunately requirement tell drug really works unexpected side-effects. one things sign agree trial new drug. Take JAK inhibitors instance. Even post-trial, found cause pulmonary embolism higher case Toficitinib, small chance dying take higher dosages (ie inflamatory bowel disease), appears safe lower dosages rheumatoid arthritis. way figure kind thing small trials volunteers handing everyone. fuck wrong you? Accurate sickly digest went 15k July 12th, so, you’re wrong. necessarily disagree. got maths wrong. billionaires need us, need them. Elon Musk going build self driving electric cars rockets, Jeff Bezos going able fill 20 million Amazon orders day personally.

We still know long term effects virus, non-zero probability death worst outcome COVID-19 infection. even die may unable work, complications. higher zero change millennials inherit earth, sooner, rather later.

Lastly grand scheme things, 100.000 dead people, refusing wear masks voluntarily taking gene pool, mind numbing stupidity ultimately boon universe.

Would better elected officials, support taxes, worked towards taking care us, rather profiting misery? Sure. that's administration got, vote November.

Until then, words Dr. Mike, stay healthy happy. definitely lines. Look [this right opened, I'd surprised much different now. 99.9999% time results stock prices going advertising. I've lived Missouri year gotten mail seen billboards signs staked road fanatics selling flags truck die hard Republic rhetoric. lot conservatives Florida town moved from, would still see stuff parties pop election years. hard vote someone never heard research always easy some. We're already going suffer, let's make sure suffer us else learn anything important fuck things everyone else. paradox tolerance here, there's fucking line they've crossed it. ""dibs"" vaccine believe I'm sure got first batch from.

Yeah gave billion dollars help fund it.  Strange people think GOP better stock market, stocks Democrats grown last 40 years, pretty much break even Republican administrations Well, see here, would left's strategy. Republicans never plan except exact opposite. really craving hands right now. state, like many states, required mandatory masks. couldnt 20 35 days.

Vaccine takes 28 days work designed UK spooky ha. Yeah. compelled go back office ""reopening phase"" basically timed awful possible, office opened 1/2 capacity. Seems absolutely nuts me.

I one people entire office literally cannot job remotely - physical things interact with...

I sat boss ask options available me, started talking reducing exposure another group operates building continuous airflow outside &amp; dramatically lower density people it. think shocked said office environment made uncomfortable seemed like recipe disaster.

Good news sent almost everyone back home soon - Bad news sore throat may going completely insane. It’s mandatory months NYS, there’s high compliance. like rest us. 😫 asymptomatic people wandering around breathing touching stuff 11 days?  [Translation](http://hoodmemorial.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/white-flag-std.jpg)

Until opinion validated, keep yourself.

See ya. 79% less likely require ventilation control group

So reduces odds dramatically Aw, it’s cute quaint tries think. Keep buddy, one day may able make cogent point! joke im getting? know root cause alone. Fauci way visible went 60 Minutes early March say ""Right United States, people walking around masks."" Even late March [recommending healthy people wear masks] 
 
There multiple failures comes mask wearing. Yup. lost credibility. mean that's ride range activities considering opposite nothing everything. Embrace misery, 2020 bye bye happy. Netherlands couple counties already contract 400 million doses. hard hoping work. People LA don’t wear cold weather gear they’re cold, wear can. It’s fashion thing. Great news Trump’s master never could Russia kill Americans without ever drop bomb get moron elected let brainwashed idiot supporters rest. That’s messed up.

Let's also ignore fact idea long retain antibodies. Fair enough. I'll delete it. classist neoliberal strikes would rest world base perspective

First, non-Americans right even vote American officials, say American politics. Non-Americans hands tied watching American policies wreck havoc internationally.

Secondly, America pretty much anti-mask Jan-May, meanwhile many countries turned masks solace--a means continuing daily lives wearing it. Americans shit masks months, come back say... oops *most* us pro-masks still continue politicize usage mask, wonder one American politicians

You constantly try downplay calling ""some"" voice/actions equal. equal (president); say vastly powerful known

No, safely say VAST majority non-Americans give load election process--just comes it. what’s point stating things are? We’re already aware things are, reads like poster wants distract fact don’t leader right matters most. help still trying fix leadership problem.

So tired us refusing try different ways. give bitcoin? Might make transaction faster. What's point?

There's people around thr globe think COVID hoax.

There's many led guy stoking fires. 

Mask wearing way fight pandemic, clearly country fighting well control rods.

The Dutch? quite well without masks thats worried arent wearing them.

If averaging 3 4 new cases day per million might able masks mandatory public transportation. serve great horned rat yes-yes.  get rid A/C. may need *re-engineer* it, though.

Single-pass air ideal minimize virus risk (ie, air never recirculated), proper filtration systems HVAC go long way towards enabling energy savings come recirculation reducing airborne virus spread. Modern hospitals use solutions keep air running. selfless humble society.
Now, where’s award selfless humble? supposed arrive 5 minutes ago! Let speak manager agree many state plates Florida right mostly NY/NJ/MA. people still vacationing pandemic? would come Florida late July? isn’t opinion. literally arrested real life real police officer criminally speed nearby city street.

Once threatening lives people around ignorance actions (or inaction - negligence also criminal allow people come harm death deliberate failure act), forfeited right autonomy. rightfully so.

That society functions. cannot simply anything like, physically it. going around maskless, potentially threatening lives hundreds even thousands people around you. 150,000 dead Americans, many would still alive people adopted universal mask use sooner. 

There nothing tyrannical wearing mask you’re shopping Walmart, standing around people public enclosed space. said, compassionate act. 

And even truly stood rather ignorant conviction yours... completely selfish actions... still want everyone wearing masks. get point nobody needs wear mask much, much faster everyone wears one peak pandemic. mask limits personal risk contracting virus spreading someone care about. complete sociopath would still want everyone wearing masks, situation public personal best interests completely align.

There literally logical argument make wearing mask twenty minutes buy cheesy poofs corner store. It’s trampling anyone’s rights expect member society take actions could deprive fellow citizens right LIVE.

There ethical argument universal mask use worst pandemic lifetime. definitions, airborne transmission depends size particles spread, aerosols, less five microns size, qualifying airborne. Particles larger five microns classified droplets, heavier drop ground faster. scientists say cutoff false dichotomy oversimplifies matter, many situations droplet also says aerosols cannot ruled means transmission.

They crushed spread. Period. way isn’t true somehow magically got much milder strain doesn’t kill force people hospital. 

It’s time change stance. isn’t matter opinion. It’s matter fact, you’re wrong according evidence. everyone wearing mask chances virus spread aerosols less negligible. Parts Texas also heavily stricken poverty etc. going doctor missing work bankrupt ya, do? Keep working, hope push through, maybe drop dead. know someone forced go back work door company Wisconsin. closed weeks, reopened, someone got sick. wife died couple months ago. So, choice refuse return job, lose unemployment, go bankrupt risk homelessness, lose family member death corona virus. choice. live consequences whatever decide? I’ve read, vaccine stronger antibody response people it. Wouldn’t help people have? “it doesn’t apply *me* one it” attitude exactly situation. You’re wrong large percentage reason parents want kids back school free babysitter.

I know case 100% cases, lot. could classes online, kid would home. (ie choice education person home. options...that provide babysitter.)

But, YES - hitting nail head. teaching kids think memorize facts. world changing skills required survive thrive changing...and schools...aren't. wording adds nothing value statement. commented: large time period infectious knowing infectious. Thus time pandemic endangering others wearing mask know infected. one indianewstv.com post. get good news somewhat annoying everyone thinks pandemic over. Michigan made masks law last week

Retailers begged 2 weeks ago make masks laws states vs enforce themselves

Now many retailers chosen enforce masks go alone without state fed help, like Target, Wal-Mart, Sams Club, Kohls... enough billionaires, then. We're good. know, that's mentioned parody part. resorting comments like blurs line fact fiction. heard internet Bill Gates creeping one lab desks sprinkle microchips there! What's everyone dying from, then? Excess mortality indicates subtract covid deaths still many deaths last year. nine ten leading causes death, caused by?  Believe government.. government soundbites inappropriate jokes

..but even entertain idea listening professor infection immunity?

This we're mess. People listen bumbling dickwads ignore scientists. can't say everywhere live contact tracing big thing stories read big thing places, article references NYC, says tracers can't ask they've protests ppl offer information imagine many so. New Yorkers realize there's whole big country much bigger NYC. 

I'm done thread, obviously agenda blame major rise positive Coronavirus cases protests multiple sources report that's case. Live whatever reality choose. Tldr: hoax. Charts go up. Flat...vertically flat. Said nothing sort. don’t deny masks. disgusting people, amazing. made fanta menace look bad calling press conference, I'd bet whatever Kemp pressured something that. Well fuck supposed get informed? 

Call you? 

Just ignore florida massive numbers? 

Why massive numbers people following mandates? 

I give shit random person says. I'm American I'm horrified. entire family severe underlying lung issues cannot completely isolate. I'm going lose someone end this. almost like calling shitty systems correct thing do. butthurt? hard really know accurate IFR based estimates.

Interesting they'd IFR Asymptomatic people high.

But, big guessing game:

Like I've read IFR estimates estimate test identify 1/5 1/6 actual infected. Meaning infections 6 times higher. state 1000 infections...they assume 5000-6000. Florida would 50000-60000 infections day. really lowers death rate estimate 6 times cases, amount deaths. I'm NJ, supposed travel Canada, Netherlands, bunch US National Parks summer. go anywhere. even traveled outside county since early March. I'm traveling anywhere there's vaccine.

Other countries right thing banning us. Americans whole proven cannot trusted nice things. Well fuck OSHA? smaller numbers used, also florida,etc positivity rate would high non suspicious people tested Finally good news! consequences really tragic whole situation ridiculous can’t help laugh it. find numerous articles around country say otherwise. Here's one Miami. Check mobility data Sweden, personally think tepid measures little late maybe shutdown bring infection burden control?

Since one wears masks testing n tracing limited, virus still spreading unabated, end game looks like either shutdown vaccine save Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* dispute still going although like before. hard part wrong right. suggested medical academic council shut entire city but, mayor president agreed country go full stop longer. People eat, work. right. also parts US, particularly near border, find this. Awesome results! :) make clear early days hopefull!  might kill time tell  Well that's kind point. Taking longer sort flattening exponential growth rate. subway probably much higher r0 extreme close interaction, enclosed spaces little ventilation, nearly impossible type tracing. 

That said, entirely possible I'm wrong. really need shut shit would say since basically new York worst (case per day wise anyway) new York already lockdown two weeks point. 

And anyone responds it...I know slightly false equivalence compare cases per day increase testing availability compared end March. just...honestly better metric yet. America turned society business forgot employees strike. sky news trash Australia, maybe better UK.  Yes main route infection seems inhaling particles unfavorable conditions reduces virus lifetime air well.

Teach it! Yet another instance fine tradition Swedish officials wildly overestimating population immunity (well, almost certainly case, definitely done many, many times past cases). country whose officials claim herd immunity never strategy, [despite many earlier claims actions support sure like exaggerate number population who's gotten disease. 

In contrast: Denmark, Norway Finland 40% capital disease would viewed huge failure suppression / Test, Trace, Isolate strategies. 

And I'm sure like times Stockholm ['close herd claim also hold water, described Norwegian researchers.

These people miracle circumstances caught break. Instead upset someone else catching deal, happy lot hardworking people completely fucked going like starve death. Covid normal situation never be

Yes, normal. Viruses existed way mankind continue exist long gone. 

Cars, hand, normal 200 years ago exist. 200 years ago 0 car crash fatalities entire world, today 1.35 million people die car crashes year REALLY going say even related drunk driving? Come on, really? Cars dangerous. There's doubt it. also necessary functioning modern day society way schools hospitals necessary.

Why allow cars exist? cost-benefit analysis, we, society, deemed 1.35 million car crash deaths year acceptable price pay benefits cars daily life.

Don't intellectually dishonest, please. 

Masks proven close 100% effective everyone wears them. efforts aimed equate masks seatbelts = sure, MIGHT still die wear seatbelt illogical never use seatbelt way illogical stay home never drive MIGHT still die even take precautions. heard Trump’s voice threw little mouth. already are. Pneumonia deaths year notoriously high likely drop back 2 years. true death count take years sort through. fellow Republicans trying censure Governor Abbott recent state GOP convention. actually right around corner? point medical leaders switch standard ""it's certain ever get vaccine"" line ""we're likely vaccine soon"", it'll look pretty funny vaccine actually here.  Here's hoping immunity somewhat long-lasting. Ontario’s case fatality ratio 4x Washington State, got hit early retirement homes

Why Ontario’s case fatality multiple WA’s? extremely pathetic. know ceremony really memorable people, hour two worth fun willing risk people care about's health. advanced much sciences. yet act ignorant.

Its fine want to, nobody forcing unless Trumps secret police starts getting super weird doubt anybody be, *are* safe conditions. still soon know enough offer protection \[...\] UK already ordered 100 million doses

I hope contract good cancellation clause trials fail.

We certainly funding research, sounds like soon placing orders. Especially orders 35 million doses British people.

EDIT: thanks /u/is-this-a-nick's reply

I guess strategy here, far enough research phase (and looking promising) start mass production case passes trial, theory, trial successful got 100 million doses ready go day trial completes Yes, guy telling go data results studies science denier, guy saying hey look politician said. Ok buddy. Plague mortality 20% estimated 100 million deaths, corona ~0.2% mortality 0.5 million far. Comparison make sense.  Paying big fine. That's France since today. 135€ (around $155) wear public enclosed place/space. People care money (and losing piece fabric), even complain like US (or everywhere else), wear it. Otherwise lot people wear them. shops refuse people without mask else _they_ pay fine customer without mask. called question one source... can’t apply information 1 source apply another isn’t strong enough link. That’s basic journalism. never called question ‘sources’, ‘vaccine researchers’ professors plural. Please don’t twist said. Cue conspiracy theorists going whine ^(assuming vaccine successful) come November, December, January, ^(after election, words) etc. people get vaccinated worry COVID-19 drops. ! truly depends are. I'm far north Phoenix/Scottsdale empty: tons snowbirds left. Grocery store volume regular, everyone except dad wearing MAGA hat two sons wearing masks. would say stores returned business usual respect social distancing employees/shoppers wearing masks. got emissions tested day usual experience, wearing masks purposely clean gloved hands right front you. Restaurants around (almost every restaurant AZ patio form outdoor dining) definitely less crowded people still going out. air longer panicked like March. either ""let's get this"" patriot tantrum. ton here, too. see commonly old men. things can't speak salons, golf, offices. hot (over 105 3 weeks now) lot people even outdoors anymore unless they're lake. 50/50 whether they'll packed not, perfect social distancing activity week. Edit add: us agreed traffic dropped April. seemed snowbirds office closures. many things remaining essential, small businesses landscaping, people roads whose offices closed. way closures allowed people get road ""errands."" important different matter entirely. US concentration camps outbreaks well prisons too. people gonna learn comes laws snd regulations *the US fucking France England*? governmental structure allow Trump order everybody wesr mask, allow Congress either. cases like US like 50 separate countries.  ""No latex dirty germ spreader""

Ok, going spread germs latex gloves admit two things.

1: germs.

2: germs spread hand/touch.

In world agree two things come conclusion hands touched anything dirtier gloves touched nothing? really found much info regarding sore throats, except sometimes listed one less common symptoms. sore throat lasted 5-6 days couple weeks ago, went urgent care facility, doctor gave strep test (negative), really ask questions possible contacts. sick work, time, colleague tested positive covid. find returned work.

I woke yesterday, sore throat, continuing today. fever. insurance, sure worth get test not. anyone tested positive throat symptoms? guess could allergies too, symptoms feel alarming now.

Never lifetimes seeing clearly. US, Brazil Mexico compared Korea, Taiwan New Zeland. sad, truly. Fatalistic say true. recognize people (Trump especially) muddying water issue￼￼, people convinced. anecdata mask wearing increased significantly Trump-friendly state. read tests used incomplete missing part state secured process using tests. much pay Dak? F.  Federal government two positive things.

1: Travel restrictions -- done haphazardly, little, late.

2: Dumping money people businesses. one actually supposed to! Now, let's see extend properly. 2nd wave COVID running unchecked right now.

Uh no, first wave.

Your ""red"" (aka moron states thats me) shutdown re-opened Virus even properly going. never shutdown.

This first wave. Moderna's vaccine works super easy scale production since mRNA vaccine. That's main advantage explain ""passaging"" unique situation six patients' lungs, rather usual lab-based effort. RaTG13 possibly coronavirus varieties patients' lungs breathing guano mine could repeatedly mixed way one would otherwise using animal cell samples. would happened 2012 samples collected, rather later Wuhan lab.

Of course work samples lab may happened, MMP theory actually required. least we’re still travel Mexico affordable pharmaceuticals I’m British well aware number people go America treatment How? Yeah, point tried make ""being 100% sure"" bit. think worded lot better did, though. Taking part clinical tried human guinea pig, make sure issues expected. Better one guy suffer millions ""well, worked mouse"" Still mad, huh? I’m going things article you’re commenting on. 300 mil doses dedicated U.S. feds financing production efficacy project warp speed. 

We're gonna need em lol article literally says ""it still soon know enough offer protection"" 

Imagine buying 100 million placebos.

I fully agree need *working* vaccine ASAP, think commit buying know work (we funding research, I'm convinced placing orders, especially volume, appropriate way funding them). Lots states requiring masks rn Trump talks lot, powerful enablers.

He's man words, stop talking. people may need higher doses dose might incorrectly injected wasted Oxfords (UK) results nothing Operation Warp Speed US, lol completely dependent age people infected. 

If they’re 45, you’re looking 3-6 deaths per 10,000 infections. 

That number rises quickly older people get infected. 

Basically, idea many deaths going come this. vast majority deaths US nursing homes. Florida successfully keeps nursing homes, deaths few. 

But that’s big if. rule Quebec (in province, like state) masks mandatory public interior spaces restaurant take seated table. many dead kids economy worth? 5? 10? Would 15 dead kids many, would decide schools closed? No, that's people refuse vaccine refuse wear masks, find contracting corona 10th time locks brain dead hunger state, anything moves want bite.

Would cruel want anti mask assholes get last? Since seem prone spreading it, think first ones get it. think ship third world countries people quarantined, people constantly wear masks, medical professionals across US. Make every Republican leader refused issue mask order wear mask six months allowed get one. believe half fuckers deserve shot deserve less everyone else. Thank you. good sign. Big B Big serve pleasure capital, hence maintained radio silence 43% American workers sent home work indefinitely despite reopen agenda.  may need stick small flat head screwdriver push small tab release blade mount wiper arm. Otherwise snap install it. Social pressure via making masks cultural norm. majority people wear masks, lot anti-maskers comply order avoid looking place. Generally speaking, people tend want conform. Indias covaxin supposed skip 2nd 3rd trial altogether roll august 15, idea shot safety precautions. theyre testing out, mean, vaccine = better right Scientology claims *Xenu, dictator ""Galactic Confederacy"" brought billions people Earth 75 million years ago, stacked around volcanoes, killed hydrogen bombs.*

It matter many times repeat assertion much want Sweden's policy herd immunity. Sweden's policy independent subjective opinions. read comments lot people dismissing deaths younger people ""well, pre-existing condition"". pre-existing conditions common manageable. People pre-existing conditions usually live fairly normal lifespans treatment monitoring. would survive flu, generally survive pneumonia too. pre-existing conditions making super fragile vulnerable, virus exceptionally dangerous. hear/read people use ""pre-existing conditions"" explanation victim already death's door contracting virus. that's true. leading normal lives common manageable medical conditions. even concerning. encourage test subjects disregard social distancing protocols? Doesn’t kind undermine data they’re given vaccine, sitting apartment 4 weeks, you’re claiming it’s success? tell go act without inhibition (no masks, hug people, shake hands)?  believe marshmallow test willpower rather motivation. lucky people born strong willpower rest need practice training strengthen it. 
The motivation somewhat different though. giving people good reason learn something. find lot adults say something along lines ""you need study make good living grown up"". that's distant abstract young kids. example, daughter really like word problems fractions. work, time questioning needs boring stuff. going started baking together. soon measure ingredients, came together. sudden, fractions became useful difficult. exactly Operation Warp speed US - spending billions promising vaccines. reason vaccinated September vaccine need go approvals logistics administering vaccine entire population. I'm Swedish US way better job Europe.

What's source completely made bullshit?

I love getting upvoted though literally lying - right wing Americans LOVE reading unverified bullshit confirms nonsensical beliefs. Probably fund research much. understand Oxford vacinne generic licence manufacturing break even. think research funds coming national governments etc probably collected shit ton enough slushing around new coffee machine ping pong table. state lockdown orders nobody really quarantined, every job except retail deemed essential tons people still around others everyday work. lockdowns strict enough, people would flipped literally forced stay home. Lousy Smarch weather coming years we'll see statistics total deaths versus expected deaths plus margin error much better estimation true death toll pandemic. opposite happening UK statistics show too.

&amp;#x200B;

This last month already knew 30-35k deaths standard expected deaths plus reported COVID deaths US. deaths added official number. I'm sure number 35-40k official tally. real COVID death toll sitting 177k - 182k. severe anxiety wearing mask, much managing anxiety therapy techniques medication isn’t effective enough, it’s probably best stay home time being. description can’t possibly describe huge chunk people. imagine doctors would willing prescribe limited amounts benzos people handle masks help controlling anxiety.

The problem fairly large set people looking magic phrase claim wear mask public, isn’t plausible many people severe treatment-resistant anxiety makes impossible wear masks doesn’t make afraid going public protection virus kill people. They’re screwing people actually problem making excuse seem like bullshit. accomplishment great create ""Oxford prize"" great accomplishments humanity. No, pay. Ignore people. Obamacare requires insurers pay cost sharing. uninsured new HEROES act bouncing around congress pay it...will signed within week two. people may pay bought short term Trumpcare plans- like 3 Million people. Awsering age old question ""Why here?"" 

Memes Ya it’s nice. went wedding it’s getting way better here. 

Economy basically completely back up. Definitely still missing service industry jobs due theatres less capacity restaurants Today, first time months Delhi saw less 1000 new infections. I’d train fat leave ""Europe"" lol. Like guys even trying anymore ""real"".  understand saying.

I  Sounds like bunch kids roaming streets day parents go work. Okay rant. Yes I'm based US watching news. just. Like countries locked down, testing, wear masks, social distance. able drag number cases low. US it?

If keep saying testing increases cases prevents reopening? like stop testing, virus still even know it? Thus making worse people scared getting virus, able work properly restart economy. People still flock restaurants, events etc.

Slowing testing like walking minefield blind without metal detector. can't see this???

EDIT: another point add on:

If America opened economic imbalance stuff since world rely import exports. industry America opened, nothing gets done. markets America opened due weakened income due unemployment, nothing gets bought.

So American problem anymore imo...  forever money. every time get subway footlong make sure slam sliced cucumbers bad boy that's probably i'll immune get virus. Ah yes, state young kids go home isolate without infecting parents. call secret intelligence. That's - SECRET.....intelligence. saying ""Ahhh let's get rid virus, like bad thing!"", said people.....slow social distancing please! Everybody else wants gone going - going - knew. already knew knew intelligent.....they say intelligent but......if secret nobody knows now, look phase three? us. US. America best.

EDIT: Forgot customary /s. “These kids got get back school.... get COVID-19, — go school — they’re going hospitals.... They’re going go home they’re going get it.” - Missouri Governor Mike Parson

Obviously great leader crazy thing even kind fuckery going numbers they're putting still wildly high. not? Oh wow. fucking idiot. left tin foil hat /r/conspiracy They’re going go home, infecting teachers infect family spread virus even more.

If thought numbers bad now, wait three weeks schools reopen. good portion? think overestimating size group people Like ppe masks Like said, incompetent governance. folks would this. . . want know guy smoking know never buy. There's gonna lot orphans US within year Misery. lovely state. 🤦 like insurance keep insurance, costs arm leg. scenario think maybe makes worthwhile covered individual treated serious condition cost would less medical bills. FUCK  Isn’t really bad sign? means younger people getting sicker. Tldr article

""The study, peer-reviewed, limited Europe""

There ya go folks, nothing see May ask source this. I'm researching video need exact paragraph says completed phase 2 says phase 3. agree 100%. think dude reading ill intent comment implied stated. That's major crash was. Virtually stock travel industry 50% since March. Even major indices almost 50% since March. OSHA literally recommend right fucking website mate.

Also SEVENTY scientific papers say work guess ""few OSHA employees"" know office cleaners something. Fuck China fuck government well. One doesn’t exclude other. got shit control domestically, said stands. Yes ans anti masker high school drop go hand hand, right? Nothing, Coronavirus exist hoax /s. wonder rrp then. 😂 thought March 2027? Damn. shitty confirmation bias antivaxx mom group  They're mandatory Massachusettes. Yeah, I’m shaking head this. Everyone saw play across world NY states yet didn’t plan? really want first group people take vaccine right available?

I'm engineer know wait version 2 side effects figured out.

EDIT: saying conspiracy. I'm afraid figured side effects. I’ve read two medical microbiology (same title, different authors) textbooks state corona viruses reinfections common immunity doesn’t persist. [Medical Microbiology 8th Edition, [Medical Microbiology 4th Edition, S. possible oxford vaccine engineered way bypass whatever blocking long term immunity? 

## Executive summary:

1. first months pandemic, scientific uncertainty usefulness public masking. Conflicting guidance given several official sources1–3.
2. convincing evidence multiple controlled experiments4–6 field observations7–11 wearing masks reduces transmission COVID-19 healthcare workers public. evidence COVID-19 specific emerged past months1,7.
3. Masks prevent infected people spreading virus others trapping respiratory droplets (tiny moisture particles) produced cough, speak, breath10,12,13. Cloth masks stop 90% dispersal droplets carrying virus12,14. evidence cloth masks also protect wearer infection7,8, though less certain.
4. Masks highly safe, minor uncommon side effects1,15,16. addition many medical studies, public masking proven safe among children, adults, elderly cultures practice long common10,17. However, sensitive individuals wear masks, compromised respiratory systems18 individuals cannot remove adjust masks (children 2 people severe disabilities)13.
5. Researchers hospitals, universities, private sector, government agencies concluded **masks could one powerful cost-effective tools stop COVID-19 accelerate economic recovery**1,4,5,9,10,17. universal agreement, however, masking alone enough stop pandemic. Masking effective combined physical distancing, frequent handwashing, rapid testing, coordinated contact tracing1,7,19. Indoor dining busy? pick up/delivery orders. week, [Governor Parson] signed bill cracked pressing problem of fake service animals.

Actually, applaud one. Electronic devices always unnecessary. Everything else, though? 100% correct. also leverage extra doses part humanitarian aid packages countries, contributing WHO, etc.  India, need 1.5 billion doses. Damn, would costly. much worse Cleveland. think due people non-compliant. They're ignorant maybe stupid. Tangentially television talking heads wearing masks adjust every ten seconds? walk around like camera lives? Might realize masks working perhaps need tinkering? Death certificates actually complicated. forms vary (I think state) list sequence events leading death, mechanism death, contributing factors comorbidites. someone died car accident also covid, could see (and blunt trauma, diabetes etc) listed somewhere form. everyone correctly choosing goes one section always straightforward requires training experience. I’d love someone ask Trump Barron going back school. ask non First Lady. joke strongly believe it’s mix locals tourists. Come christmas war go home. yeah going many years wearing masks public think catch it. massive segment population permanently scarred going forward. share saw May 2021 bit? May 2021 wedding planned (booked pre-COVID), causing extreme anxiety even though ways away banned r/ChinStraps ""In Phase 1 trials, goal determine any immediate adverse effects. done tests small number healthy people, generally fewer 100.""

The real question is, willing play Russian roulette number side effects? That’s crazy good news especially durability Nope, that’s deer hunters eating prions.

Pfizer moderna october-december well Ok rick grimes mind, absolutely get phase 3 trials going Florida/Arizona i’m atlanta, Kamala KLB even plot log. picked random points inon curve, pick cases/deaths half number, saw consistent 3-4 week gap matter part curve looked at. India massive country much noise averaging produced nice exponential function. Instead singleing USA consider looking states individually. 3/5's states requiring masks public places. Laugh states like Georgia, many well.  Billionaires president: want economy crash we'll open country.

They never thought long term consequences. That's crazy told thing company morning. Said returning work Jan earliest. It’s like this. 

I don’t see it= can’t relate

I don’t know anyone it= real?

News says don’t panic = shouldn’t panic

My sister Won’t wear mask. She’s compromised. She’s constantly parents. high risk. nurse one point trusted much medical judgement. lost backing this. 

The thing makes angriest need someone watch kid participate viral experiment reopening schools. one else turn parents wife’s parents work education. — also highly susceptible COVID-19 btw. can’t convince return need pay bills. choose lesser chance infection. It’s easier keep three people come contact 40 every hour hours day. 

So answer question depths heads ass. 

Yes. disinformation campaign thrown hard issue would make kgb blush. 

In penny—- someone makes mind something that’s it. People don’t like wrong. 

This virus new information keeps coming re-evaluate thought knew. people can’t years long campaign distrust thrown American people loads people cannot bothered new information. means previous info lie therefore nothing true. 

We terrible mess here. didnt occur playgrounds would tiny. work 4 schools yards massive. students outside recess multiple soccer pitches, track, football field, playground, forest. class time would easy. didnt think schools yard. Every school attended worker large yards.

That said, really hope students show expecting additional, near immediate explosion 2000-4000 cases first weeks town alone. goal save economy, adding fear mind people want shopping, keeping home shopping online instead, pretty damn counter intuitive. go anti-maskers economic cost had, US government would absolutely moronic foot bill get people vaccinated end crisis.

Granted existing leadership, put past try profit it. completely agree. wish people would realize they’re played like fiddles. Social media huge backdoor kinds foreign propaganda. used fly planes drop leaflets. anyone create account spread divisive demoralizing talking points. UK consistently punches weight. Look successful arts. Well seeing rest developed world seems shit together 4 years ago de facto leaders free world yeah pretty fascinating watch empire crumble real time fuckwitted morons deny science. American confirm many arguments like related called individual rights go time States. Think right bear arms. individuals health insurance mandate. part ramifications don’t directly affect individuals claim rights. Interestingly enough mask issue different sense choice wear mask serious direct health implications individuals holding position. know? country bio lab horseshoe bats? Visitors 110 countries Wuhan last 10 days October. first known Covid-19 patient Wuhan died November 17. now, 109 countries Covid-19. riots feds fuck rollout vaccine US. Everybody edge frustrated, watching rest world eat cake starve stupidity would cause mass riots. know I'd streets. lot people quite literally nothing else lose vaccine last hope getting back feet. 

Don't fuck desperation. company work nearly 200 confirmed cases last week alone. crazy.  DYSTOPIA! I'm sure phenomenal they're saying offers two months immunity most? seems really bad me. states raging dumpster fire stick ""for kids"" think things get better time.  maybe idk 2 years ago, thought like swiss cheese roast beef sammich september? possible? pass phase three trials? suspect FL exact death count 2 days row? Third world disguise. like term ""Florida Virus."" Way better racist names Trump keeps trying make popular. joseph, mary 12 disciples  Anxiety highly irrational though, anxiety attack body mind 100% focused perceived threat supposedly going kill right now. Even threat real. kind situation access guns arms guaranteed Constitution? I'm educator, aware consequences kid strong education. work underprivileged community. 

I've kids class die too. I've student who's parent passed away (while class) every year. 

Those lives cannot made up, education be. Furthermore, lack things like internet access lack technology legislative solution. Many cities tried build city-wide wi-fi network blocked states. 

WE address societal inequity, done education system. need stop asking educators fix it. Hotty toddy, bitches I’m sorry hear that. hope it’s cold, you’re well. Good luck blindly believing article completely discrediting ones saying September/October realistic lol. Astrazeneca said 90 million doses ready UK September, 300 million US. Please stop giving up.

We want people wear masks. got easy part problem. move onto hard problem.

Every additional person get wear mask big success now. managed get one person start wearing masks past week. us reading get one person next week same, real progress. called context. lost people like you. gave context. like schooled. Probably beginnings issues.

If wanted could turn back ask said exact words...but want look like moron, understand context trying add text. Even incorrectly adding it. mandatory Oregon well, anytime public. 

The horror stories friends service industry sad. anti-mask people absolute trash. Now? mandatory face masks March June... dad literally got telling back day, fog 5 times thicker pesticide trucks nowadays. Yikes... Depends batch area. many people talking per batch? Even 20 time definitely worth it. 

Can use hot spots? No. use places relatively low prevalence save much time resources. Okay least people would wear masks Halloween. *will* get it, right spreading Plague family members. RIP Grandma. forget vaccinations get prioritized. Healthcare workers military/national guard probably go first. might months Joe Blow working office ability get vaccinated. I'm hoping big chain stores making mandatory effect. Maybe smaller businesses entertainment venues follow suit. state governor this? know future stay fuck it. Lol comments used doom gloom bullshit, issue own, they’re completely ignorant uninformed comments. It’s one thing pessimistic, it’s quite another stupid. facilities testing using test developed US maximum capacity bringing test different makes sense. using methods increase number tests reduce time receive results. emailed last week received response. phone mailbox full can't leave message. Something tells say they're better people.  They're going go home, give families. Two things:

1. need two doses per person.

2. We're at-risk, meaning we're gonna pay hope data indicates works. We'd rather lose billion dollars instead many trillions dollars later economy continues shuttered.  Well that’s effing point. They’re kind themselves. reward bad behaviour? I’ve seen massive amount black folks wearing masks people refuse wear mask probably also refuse vaccine. 

Although, tbh, I'm leery vaccine tested extensively. history books (and shouldn't) view US positive light regards handled COVID-19. widely available.

They already producing it.  guess depends definition ""wide"" is. That’s absurd misinterpretation. Seen spot prices gold &amp; silver lately? metal ETFs?

Ya. There's reason that.  Nope. don’t count pneumonia deaths anyone pre-existing condition. FL well 10k+++ now.

Edit: considered old pre-existing condition coronavirus die form die old age - coronavirus.  ""Rare circumstances""

More million americans: rare circumstances. complaining job really selling me. imagine line hiring must miles long. knew someone loved job could put good word.... recent edit.. I’m surprised people don’t want connect you.. promise nothing depression. 

Get reddit get fucking help. continue sad excuse person thrives bring others down.. keep fucking self. Maybe they’re trying go full week One big mysteries COVID children get much lower rate adults. fact established long ago, areas like Wuhan France loads children exposed virus schools closed. 

The idea children largely spared exposure departs scientific consensus. know children affected SARS-2. think whatever want, side evidence. elaborate that? would think positivity rate measures rate spread, testing per capita tells effective testing itself. bad we’re far gone useful. Pool testing efficient % positive low.  head buried sand, perspective may correct. 

Unfortunately entire political party digging holes free. understand implying comment. please explain? they’ll refuse enforce “muh rights”. Amazingly police find constitution *they don’t want job*. We’ll see. Depends good are.  **CHAD**ox1 nCoV-19 [insert expletives here](http://Auto Idiot know everyone likes shit US. one things we've conquered though mass distribution. bring Jeff Bezos tell get shit hands consumers early possible will. government Trump particular massive interest getting many people possible quickly possible.

Clearly planning quarantine all. believe ""I want break quarantine go hospital"" line I've got lovely bridge sale discuss researchers said September... I'm high school teacher super frustrated. everyone forget needing flatten curve help hospitals opening schools flood hospitals. media isn’t really highlighting big positive Oxford vaccine news is. Still semi-apocalyptic headlines place.

It may time unsubscribe lot papers disconnect messed society fully. Sigh. Named Karen here. Wear mask. global pandemic contracted make dead, yes. Fucking retarded suggesting otherwise TLDR: batch testing representative sample talking children... can't wear masks properly. Fault #1 argument; teachers already hard enough time getting kids stay seated raise hand ask questions. know several teachers dealt chronic lickers. talking non-fully developed humans. already see hard time keeping masks properly stores. literal impossible task calling for.

As car scenario: something like happen. called DRUNK DRIVING. Everyone thought perfectly reasonable ban something involved driving safety public due circumstances increased yet manageable risk. issuing logical fallacies trying apply completely unrelated situations. car crash analogy strives make point normal situations; Covid normal situation never be. drunk driving normal situation never be. Stop trying act like Covid entirely normal situation, like driving car... really isn't. different. Trust.  prediction still one following probably going true early vaccine:

It 100% effective, percentage people getting partial immunity.

Any immunity gained temporary, requiring booster shots (which may difficult obtain, depending available supply).

There side effects prevent large number people able get vaccine.

None issues stop distribution vaccine, make realistic expectations. Keep mind, we're talking potential vaccine timeline that's four times faster vaccine history, anything we're able get monumental achievement, issues probably expected. Thankfully specific vaccine platform made MERS, didn’t cut safety testing corners. Really took huge financial bet this, due modern monetary theory, governments afford LOL Pardon ignorance, could potentially used allergies too? understand that, I'm talking terms inside body. I'm stating RNA based life form respond RNA test outside actively replicating, I'm considering specific test disease inside body. trying project articulating here. SENATE incorrect. AstraZeneca already work mass-producing vaccine. plan 2 billion doses READY September. likely continue ramping production light positive developments.  That's funny cause I'm NJ wife's test took 9 days come back. 2 weeks ago. again, you’re saying conspiracy, they’re lying deaths hospitalizations. 

Let clear: impossibility Japan crush hospitalization death curves also crushing infections curves. 

Yet you’re saying thing impossible actually happening. 

So two options: either you’re wrong don’t know you’re talking Japan lying death/hospitalization data. 

There possibility. say article, reputable article seen. literally says article specifically UK, widely available next year. money lobbies bill allowing sued. believe you! Jerome Adams made [irresponsible Februrary. blood thousands Americans hands. Nothing says redeem credibility. worst surgeon general history country. difficult believe flea following footsteps people like C. Everett Koop. He's shameful example someone put political pandering public health. always remembered ROOT CAUSE anti-mask crusade, nothing says undo damage caused beginning. early researchers poopooed lab origin, focused lab genetic engineered virus one passaged naturally coaxed. believe purely self-serving take part avoid harm career paths implication Research Lab released global pandemic virus. Phase 3 underway. results phase 1 report. Pretty much. Making safe vaccines follows old good-fast-cheap dilemma. Even removing “cheap” though, overlap good fast impossible predict something like virus (and type virus haven’t developed vaccine waaaay variable - unlike flu example).

This article nice job going general issues: Fuck, they've caught us. Quick everyone, back Palace. really hope vaccine news arriving September right.

Because otherwise lack good containment measures matter time virus takes full toll whole population.

Remember 330 million Americans x 0.4% fatality rate would mean 1.32 million deaths.

This US, assuming fatality rate higher due lack treatment, assuming one cannot catch second time...

I frightened hate dependent others wearing mask protect me, protect wearing one. Surely really think people protesting people authority institute fine? really ready jump blind multiple administrations Vaccine without confirming safe effective. mindless self-assured approach virus completely blown first place. make minimum wage, 30 dollars several house work likely full days pay.

Hey whatever I'm reliant government handout. Free rides time get creative ways survive instead sitting ass Yet hunchgut refuses put mask order place thinks disappear own. blocking CDC reporting numbers continue hide numbers keep people wearing masks.

I'm going go all, mom like 4 lung issues. scary good day. also medical needs cannot put receive treatment person. lives area people seldom wear masks general public, puts people healthcare higher risk getting giving it.

It's really hard watch people make stupid decisions high risk infringe upon safety others. Right...no one saying though...? genuinely idea you’re talking about. mass-producing vaccine, cost, when/if efficacy proven phase 3, won’t wait months initial production. one (other test participants) getting vaccine passes phase 3 (if does). Anyone know breakdown many days worth beds have? I'll double calling greedy fucking pig devil. Maybe even salt neutralize c-19? Sweden avoids lockdown, could check Swedish data Norway data.
Sweden deaths sums Denmark, Norway Finland.

However know ideology strong logic know disagree. entirety Europe 100million people us, currently 1/10th new cases per day

all different countries different policies people. Honestly.. country shit decades. pandemic trump shed light onto issues. Really, saying rednecks professionally licensed engineers? Good know :) remember people saying dumb Americans were? looks like american problem work museum...teachers parents lose shit tell can't eat lunches lobby go outside lovely grassy park 75° sunny nice breeze.

That said, live deep south outside school 102° heat index day 100% humidity sounds like nightmare. women legally topless NYC.

Full nude violation indecent exposure laws established enforced state New York, federal government. New York's Supreme Court ruled legal go topless 1992, amending Penal Law 245.01.

It's state law, legal consequences handled state. feels good true? None younger people (below 25) know care virus. 100% back normal life, going gyms, partying, visiting friends family etc. That's why.

Oh give people? .... man, problem, ain't nothing gonna happen me. great vaccine news lately also kind depressing. lot people died die many anti-maskers stupid selfish solution potentially right around corner. China won’t let another country/company news leading covid research without trying ride coattails That's meant.

I doubt apply US/UK supply chains. countries eligible deal/have access supply chain.

Since May, however, AstraZeneca secured supply chains e. g. CEPI, Gavi EU's IVA. batches covered 300 million doses deal would go principles institutions mentioned (especially IVA).

400 million doses vaccine produced Catalent Italy EU countries (as Germany, France, Italy Netherlands Spain join). 

I research locations institutions, likely work similarly.

I mean, great vaccine rolled almost simultaneosly pandemic global recession sooner. 

But still call ""dibs"". said think 100 million(where getting this?) vaccines available fall vaccinate elderly them. said vaccine available yet dependent late-stage trials. I'm sure personal plans hypothetical vaccine roll relevant. Sorry trouble buddy. managed turn political statement religious one.

Edit: omg. “The vaccine coming chip,” um, we're fucked. BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL UK stock 50% since March. penny stock massive amount. forget producing vaccine Government funded non profit project.  ChAd Ox1 vs virgi nCov-19

Brilliant Back May USA made huge bet Oxford vaccine something like 300 million doses (so enough 150 million people) lined initial batch available EOY. Missouri Yeah would interesting valuable actually - particular would interesting see reduce risk packed trains subways working upper limit people carriage, people back back, fan constantly blowing air keep things moving etc. may massively help us vaccine available.  expected blown time season started, pretty obvious beginning expected nothing successful solution. would amazing Rwanda, countries Africa, good handle this.

That would definitely change perception westerners towards continent.

1. immunity permanent, immunity k e year?
2. side effects? 
3. widely available, 2021? busted ass week ungrateful pieces shit took home $290 would cry. poor fucking people. doctor day told four phases vaccine: I, II, III, IV.

Majority vaccines coming along, fine (Oxford included), Phase III.  That's difficult phase vaccine successfully pass. does, ultimately go Phase IV rolled out. Oxford beginning Phase III line gets drawn. 

CanSino Chinese biotech vaccine company, paralleled Oxford vaccine, predecessor it. passed phases II ease still stuck III. One important hangups CanSino vaccine *did work well all* patients age 55 older. hangup Oxford vaccine there's evidence yet immune system learns vaccine long enough fight off. CanSino sorta stuck phase III using ingredients Oxford.  super positive, still encouraging developments nonetheless. asking buddy South absolve responsibility illnesses due COVD19, 5 years. side note, think 2 fronts; virus hoax, yet, want pass legislature protect companies, would want protect workers. 

Office work occur home - since March NYC. But, can't get office space leases - rage 3 10 years billions. 

So, next course action get sick / die nothing happens company, lose rent obligated pay contractually. 

These ghouls probably sublease office space we're dead. realize mostly tourists, right? means idiots country spreading covid.

Then go back home state... stuck too. family isolating since begining year. yep, turn frees ""normal"" tests dumpster fire states Sorry teachers, good luck! heard children can't get COVID anyway... yeah, went removed 15+. see more, please report :) thanks Texas. heat, outdoor classes probably even realistic October. probably unrealistic December latest. September kind wildcard usually still pretty damn hot month. agree - work pharma field able give doses general public september I'd gobsmacked. need complete Phase III trial, collate analyse data, publish results, request emergency approval regulators, agree governments around world distributed when, figure logistics providing vaccine general public....there's many steps involved project like this

To me, ""ready September"" means data authorities need decide emergency approval ready then, actual vaccine available local GP. Hopefully i'm wrong we'll see. Personally I'd prefer wait long-term (ideally 12 month) safety follow data Phase III trial approved general use, pressure regulators probably wont wait around kill lot older voters vote republican. research oxford vaccine Thanks calculated condescension, may apply US Brazil India, however Europe keep check via contact tracing easily kept many European first world countries. think herd immunity reached fast frankly, know wanna go rabbit hole either.

So yeah, premise US basically third world country hope keep virus contained way, response may appropriate. despite lead infinitely worse endings European country reasonably fear. 

But pandemic response team playbook previous administration. US 1st world nation. There's internationally recognized scientists saying something different. 

Honestly I'm happy live Germany day age. Look sub. Full censorship people intentionally spreading bullshit comments downplay downplayed.

What shitshow. part it, slinging shit left right.

But mostly right left. Lol op pushing political agenda, look username... trust trump though, right? Wow quicker thought Also Tories' friends families make enough money companies £300 assets government order enough product?? say - Jack Russell brewery 50 downtown Placerville great. good place burger beer making ascent Pollock Pines/Strawberry/Twin Bridges Echo Summit onto South Shore. believe God past years, attempt eat healthfully, family eating far less cooking home far more. even take-out much, maybe month.

Took shit tonne sacrifice get here. act like people never emmigrate. didnt say would easy. something want, ways.

But youre right, 10 years living countries dont know anything. Soooo....a confederacy 😂

We became confederate states America instead United styles America Quite opposite, 87. 

Quite opposite. don’t think anti-mask sentiment would bad without plandemic.

I think people would focused mark beast vaccine implant chip bit more.

It truly shame wearing mask become political statement. data anyone age 55. vaqueen

yass vaqueen slay rona fact putting piece cloth face even considered hard sad. *Not yet* 

When deal mRNA theoretical implications pretty numerous. *in theory* use mRNA siRNA silence protein transcription kind, problem ensuring it’s accurate appropriately targeted. sequencing becomes widespread next 20 years could *in theory* find ways combat various things like allergies many viruses specifically target specific protein transcriptions/translations. 

This long way it’s inching closer! obviously ton factors limit principle getting least! 2020 redemption arc maybe? it’ll good couple years? cruel want anti mask assholes get last? 

You already know anti-mask assholes also ones refusing get vaccinated vaccines contain Bill Gates’ nano-microchips makes susceptible Facial Recognition mind control via 5G cellular technology! Hell, it’ll probably even turn frogs gay. wildly hopeful beat thing science. also fully expecting anti science crowd royally fuck rest us. Read article, see bunch states increase new cases. Arizona happened drop. Often it’s another vaccine meningitis one. it’s win even control group. responded reply comment said ""People wearing masks going listen black man.

If comment post would agree you. Thank you. scaling 1077 person sample size 10k people UK, 30k US, another 7k countries, possible challenge trials deliberate infection. MUCH DIFFERENT BALLGAME. 

This subreddit turning Facebook whole group running along whatever story feels good scares day deeper investigation. would guess 25% population ""not going get vaccine"" group. yeah - we're fucked Empire, course. didn’t think Canada actually going stay it’s country, you? Tennessee so... kid got easy. Jesus told us pray quarantine.

Matthew 6:6 pray, go away yourself, shut door behind you, pray Father private. Father, sees everything, reward you. one said ""still"" vaccine implies they've still trying/failing develop one time frame, need get salty. Yes did- said need testing Everyone right cast vote according whatever ethos have. I'm really interested policing vote. you. 

This election especially difficult sucks position we're in. 

I either go third party abstain Biden's policies fatal people care understand situation universal. 

I wish option vote greater good alas options have. good news announced stimulates immune blursed news several countries handling COVID badly we'll least ample testing grounds efficacy (although admittedly, still rushed). least KaRenOx1. R/nottheonion going celebrate?

Hopefully bigly enough...Cali upped game, it'll tight win hold numba one position total # cases.... /s really.... would riots. Trump's handlers stupid.

He would get vaccine pretend funded made mean street value drugs Miami always high got first legal drug. NGL that’s worrying. almost died Neisseria meningiditis vaccine couple years ago. 106 degree temperature 5m. Thanks! Unless vaccine requires specific rare resources, chemical countries hand case right anyway, lot Asian countries holding majority medical manufacturing like tablets, pills, medicines It’s possible. 

But got 3 days one another Side effects include punching holes drywall skipping leg day. Free candy! Yet somehow hasn’t stopped essential workers thing making less people unemployment. Grocery stores etc hiring need help, it’s pretty hard find workers Government paying keep people home. 

Such perverse inventive structure, frankly economic effects money printing affect us hard coronavirus gotta look leap You’re telling planet don’t count lizard crab factions people?!?! fucking doubt. straw man attack something doesn’t exist, therefore strawman. I’m pointing it’s rednecks tinfoil hat people wearing masks. Lol surely troll... it’s taken long all, fact record breaking speed Came say something similar. schools close rains hard...im exaggerating. even closed one day last year wind advisory. I'm even old thought rediculous. think it’s notable “reinfection” reports individual doctors reporting one patients testing positive twice. That’s it. give half placebo half vaccine. likely tell go lives prior enrolling trial. compare control group experimental group.

It's helpful areas virus raging.

Let's walk 2 scenarios.

In scenario 1, enroll 10k participants in, say, Toronto, Canada. 5k get placebo 5k get good stuff. 4 week period (and I'm making numbers here), maybe 0.05% Toronto's population may expected get infected Toronto's really top things. end 4 weeks, 5 members control tested positive 2 members experimental group tested positive. Well, can't really draw conclusion outside vaccine 100% effective testing regimen (and vaccine is).

In scenario 2, thing Miami, FL. Well, Miami Florida general really top things 4 week period, expect 5% contract virus. control group comes 260 positives expimental group comes with...doesn't matter. 200 vaccine effective. 125 somewhat effective tremendously so. 20, vaccine tremendously effective. 0, created one effective vaccines human history likely screwed cheated trial process.

They'll also look groups compare larger population, whether higher number asymptomatic pauci-symptomatic nevertheless infected individuals, side effects safety issues, hospitalization rates, antibody titers, T-cell tests, etc. lot complicated scenarios laid hopefully get idea would work even lockdown-type scenario.

What see happen claim effectiveness reason claim effectiveness. guess results studies going widely, quickly, in-depth reviewed studies history, claiming efficacy none exists caught quickly.   one study doesn’t explain ICU beds occupied. read source copy/pasting cause someone told said 64-70%?

That information based *national* occupancy, individual hospitals averages are. name fucking lifesaver CHAD

Madlad help make potent anti bodies? oh wow, thats awesome. especially talk people getitng re-infected testing positive anti bodies months. I'm surprised something happened many nutjobs Ha. Plenty people know (Michigan) never got unemployment benefits. penny. Speak simple words. headline gave headache   Yeah, figured case. undoubtedly scientific, calling academic report would still quite stretch. come users like jabbatwenty dont ever respond back apologize diarrhea spews mouth constantly? Really? Still denialist bullshit? take guys concede? literally took test 7th almost 2 weeks ago got called today say it’s positive like I’ve whole time it’s late quarantine barely symptoms body's initial immune response effective enough, virus eliminated quickly tests catch. Older people less likely experience this, might parents get sick. I'm also assuming parents close contact less you. hazarding guess making spreads virus effectively. taxes go spending goes up. Like, all. Yeah, we’re pretty stupid deserve it, tbh muh profit motive!! So, raises number questions: 

1. guess kind unprecedented, vaccine licensed labs around world? 
2. expect one two vaccines quickly cross whatever regulatory finish line(s) others lose funding? 
3. see via NYT tracker (link below) already one vaccine approved China use, several others phase III. Moderna vaccine phase III next week, according reports. know parts world considering emergency use authorization healthcare workers? alluded Oxford vaccine, brief searching yield anything found said others already planning thing. mean, personally think schools stay closed. pretend valid reasons open ridiculous. 

The biggest “why” childcare expensive country many, most, average Americans rely public schools watch kids go work. area, full time childcare one kid costs least $1,000 month. many people extra $1,000 laying around *every month*? 2 kids...3? 

For many folks, schools opening really *their* option. everyone work home. everyone relatives watch kid(s) full time free. 

I absolutely understand people want, need, schools open fall. mean, many families rely schools feed kids two meals day. 

Should like this? No. reality.  we've seen time time again, death's door deniers become lucid common cold. Gov Missouri guilty planning deaths kids, family members, teachers school staff. fits description terrorist. Cuz assure you, lot parents teachers filled terror consequences policies. Rage Virus, day now.  would totally poopoo treatment comes second past December 31st 23:59:59 UTC. Anti-bodies remain month trial gives indication vaccine prevents infection. US: medical costs high best work new treatments! 

UK: vaccine goes brrr gonna one hell call regulators make. one hand they're pressure approve quickly possible, hand last thing want certain things skipped looked properly, vaccine given billions people, line large percentage start getting health problems.

I dont envy people making decisions all. work pharma field approvals based much longer studies diseases know much about. novel disease, fast development program, drug potentially going given billions people within \~1 year. dont think there's ever judgement call public health made scale before

If them, I'd probably err side caution rather approving soon efficacy proven. We're already learning lot treat virus prevent spread countries fairly good job moment (with obvious exceptions). able get month long term follow efficacy safety data following Phase III would useful giving final go ahead imo, even cover back signed morning. one main criteria reopening testing capacity far exceeds demand. “demand right now,” exponential demand. Basically, viruses protein coat containing antigens, stimulate immune response body. normal vaccine would injecting antigen. mRNA vaccine would instead contain mRNA sequence synthesize antigen body. So, mRNA enters cells, mRNA translated form antigen, antigen stimulates immune response. sure, can't really think 'hero humanity' award  thought Bill Gates already patented vaccine 2009.

Genuinely curious M4A program current Medicare basis argument strawman. M4A explicitly covers every necessary care item 100% ailments considered necessary care items.

Also, population highest healthcare costs already getting care Medicare. Costs go claim funding plan M4A, much revenue created program Medicare system currently accumulates.

Lastly, healthcare costs go since single payer system, costs calculated broadly distributed appropriately hospitals doctors offices without regular people getting price gouged $20/pill Tylenol.

Especially great results antibody treatments had. think we’ll somewhat normal Christmas well. think writer article ever experienced Midwest winter. coronababies shortage sitting stockpile drug ? fundamental ignorance science, willful, evil, amorality? u/tb0x saying enough doses cover vulnerable population, ease back restrictions (while keeping limits large gatherings ones place) get back sense normalcy.

You saying vaccine widely available every person point.

Both things true.

If personally interact anybody vaccine available you, that's call, restrictions place protect vulnerable populations. possible coronavirus vaccine proven effective end year, however, widely available. That’s net worth Even remotely works. fucking idiot. Makes fucking sense! set every classroom decent webcam kids connect zoom/Skype/Webex/ whatever ""attend"" full day school expectations deliverables turned timely online. FUCK doing? pretty simple implement.

Instead city choose either online send back released zero details online curriculum. complete lunacy know lot people spending lot money may get life lesson Oh, thank you! take look. that's really interesting.

(I spend way much time looking data though going solve something myself.) Joke's him, Democrats wearing masks Republicans. time November comes around, numbers finally enough convince everyone wear masks Republicans used precautions yet means they'll feel less safe Democrats enough experience knowing stay safe confident enough go vote.

Edit: know I'm downvoted, know southern states (conservative states) making biggest fuss forced wear masks. Cuomo made *significant* mistakes two jokers deniers. comparison eyes: Cuomo shut state down, enforced procedures slow contagion. History sort out. say like y'all move wherever want people receive open arms US.

You're either arrogant naive; take pick. definitely wrong. trial error looks like assume 25% rate optimal group size 3 end using 91K tests. reference rate 1% could batches 10 use 19K tests. itll go politicians ceos sports players etc  mindlessly proclaiming ""both sides"" without specific intelligent critique ""side"" playing make smart think appear nuanced opinion. Texan, mood since March. Ask priest/clergyman God everywhere, he/she say, 'yes'.

So can't easily pray home dangerous time? God hear prayers home, easily hear church temple.

Because clergy can't collect money you, stay home.

It's like George Carlin used say religion. ""God...He's seeing, he's knowing, he's powerful, needs money! He's terrible money!"" Kick ass, thanks! 5 years now: everyone received rushed vaccine dead. Virtually large city Asia higher density cities US mostly suburban sprawl (except older cities real solid cores like NYC, Chicago, San Francisco, Boston, Philadelphia etc.) Population density alone explain rate contagion population mostly cooperating taking precautions. Hong Kong, Tokyo, Seoul, Bangkok far better European North American cities. least US, large percentage population simply care. think virus dangerous them, even hoax, socializing bars, house parties, beaches, etc. now, multiple US states planning reopen schools. Urban density becomes irrelevant people choosing gather crowds. rest? topic Florida. No? Yeah gonna go well....  BS good control group It’s cdc It’s easier produce mass produce right? Couple tens millions one thing, billions something else don’t think mass production mRNA far along compared traditional vaccines. Maybe works get better. study, peer-reviewed, limited Europe""

Next step peer review it. think that's absolutely ridiculous, least US. People can't even save money, much less prepare pandemic. can't live nationwide tragedy going happen moment - shouldn't, should, people literally money. realistic. technically correct, real world practical sense. Thanks advice. significantly less that. part times even full time places pay min. Wage getting 30 hours week. Take taxes kind healthcare offered probably looking 180 week. Yeah hate taking online classes would rather spend extra hour day working notes/homework risk catching COVID NJ going back maskless students fall schools open least hybrid classes. We're making huge mistake sure. Here’s cause death decline per CDC 2 weeks

People literally give fuck. they've even got mask on, nose hanging out. Like walking around dick sticking fly. Cant read article becausr refuse subscribe aint bad teacher actually worry students job. great....

But also look state American populous.....


I double even 60% people would get vaccine goes science a-bailin' us again! Good thing go school taught children get school bus driven children return home live without parents grandparents household.

FFS, moron. Like ever go Iraq we're like let people die pandemic killed 140k implying? Research changed. often times dry run experimental therapies mostly safe hint efficaciousness, quietly drop real data pour in. life like getting therapy cancer. believe describe purely nationalism

As word goes, tomorrow mandatory masks again. mandatory April/may/June since July voluntarily, „we highly suggest wear them“.


Except transport vehicles (train, plane, bus,...). always mandatory there. Since last week even fine don’t wear it. Bus drivers refused transportation wear since March. know, train harder check.


Edit:
Forgot last part:


As people voluntarily wear masks, mandatory again. People plain idiots. RemindMe! 10 weeks. saw Facebook screenshots people saying ""my relative died pneumonia, covid wrote death certificate!"" Since infection lung covid cause pneumonia.  Pretty much make sure protect family. bet damn well get I'm dropping fucking mask around anti mask flock. Lol. Alabama folks often quoted saying “thank God Mississippi”. reason. Yea that's equivalent taking candy stranger. They've working alot longer year. What’s point? problem can't solved tax cut military, Republicans solution. vaccine too? link? I've seen quotes saying think right dosage could last longer. probably secretly relieved social security finally won’t run time soon, since people would probably die covid collect Supposably ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 engineered recombinant adenovirus, chimpanzee adenovirus, portion used previously side effects well charted. I'll believe see it. cant little cocaine beers without getting arrested SMH fatality rate (in layman terms, odds dying infected) currently 2.7%.

IF entire world infected, 2.7% world's population die based statistics currently available us.

That's high % consider around **9 million people** die hunger hunger-related diseases every year yet Government gives f\*\*\* solving world hunger realize Oxford vaccine prevent people contracting spreading images article enough get people listen.

The numbers recovered COVID-19 patients updated Monday, according Nirenberg. Friday, 10,284 recoveries reported.

Although 1,100 new COVID-19 cases confirmed San Antonio Bexar County Saturday, Bexar County Judge Nelson Wolff said interview KSAT shutting city.

If upward trend COVID-19 cases deaths continues, Wolff said would opt tighten restrictions currently place.

“I would shut city, would take 13 exceptions mass gatherings eliminate lot exceptions. know, run gamut sports fans, church services; number different gatherings taking place,” Wolff said.

## Abstract

**Background**

Social distancing stringent hygiene seem effective reducing number transmitted virus particles, therefore infectivity, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) could alter mode transmission disease. However, known practices change clinical course infected individuals.

**Methods**

We prospectively studied outbreak COVID-19 Switzerland among population 508 predominantly male soldiers median age 21 years. followed number infections two spatially separated cohorts almost identical baseline characteristics severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) implementation stringent social distancing.

**Results**

Of 354 soldiers infected prior implementation social distancing, 30% fell ill COVID-19. soldier group 154, infections appeared implementation social distancing, developed COVID-19 despite detection viral RNA nose virus-specific antibodies within group.

**Conclusions**

Social distancing slow spread SARS-CoV-2 cohort young, healthy adults also prevent outbreak COVID-19 still inducing immune response colonizing nasal passages. Viral inoculum infection mode transmission may key factors determining clinical course COVID-19. like grim reaper came burnt away lot stupid, husks deleted comments everywhere  I'll go arrest right now. gun bring, nerf gun supersoaker? Canadians too. rely WAY much US goods, including food. We're building little shelf-stable pantry well. Best case scenario, grocery shop much winter! forget dash microchip /s Vaccine turns people furries. Touché good safe normal produces immune reaction, opposite would unexpected. mean works. would really wait celebrate. Remind me! 6 weeks don’t know get news said basically safe there’s still long way go know works. Moderna, end sight, people, although still distance. PLEASE continue use masks, socially distance, ignorant this. Today good day good news r/thathappened long figure death toll spikes this? heard story almost verbatim caller cspan wj morning 78000 cases today.

edit: sources hard theorize.  Oh looks, one idiots We're making fun of. Gotcha one fallacy? immunogenicity ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 
vaccine SARS-CoV-2: preliminary report 
a phase 1/2, single-blind, randomised controlled trial  national problem presents itself, must united, better worse. I'm glad countries helping enforce handling internally. help us help world get faster. Exactly, snow rain things. parents supposed make work too? Also things like kindergarten far ideal kind bandaid It’s insight state. known long term cycle . watch ray dalio. understand mmt/keynesian idea short term thinking. r/thathappened Why’s seem like DeSantis following Zapp Brannigan’s kill-bot strategy sending wave wave people unit reaches limit Indeed. Ammunition free (and rather time premium matter).  r/thathappened term expired. freedom flu now. freedom virus. suits way better. mean lots people consider news item ""your governor wants kill people"".

Don't forget huge percentage people, especially fucking Missouri, get ""news"" exclusively network would never paint something like negative light.

Also keep mind voting right ~~klan~~ clan important electing someone kill citizens. People took weird joke president Dumptruck said could shoot someone 5th avenue go polls. Unfortunately chilling statement fact. republican leader kills non rich white person, somehow twisted good thing sick fucks.

Don't much faith people elected Trump react stupidity all. 58.6k last Sunday, 65.3k yesterday according Worldometer. Still looks pretty bad. look #1 Banana Republic. Way positive. Texan cousin-in-law continues post fake news. day posted doctor saying social distancing masks literally socialism. oh yeah, left ignoring science masks! (Apparently wearing masks nothing slow spread virus, gosh us liberals sure look dumb!) would think anti-maskers would start open eyes doubling this. Haha. Gold star you. cost vaccine without coverage? No? regular one works? take 2 years beurocracy also worthless rush job say america first bragging rights?  makes good stuff? Germans? Japan? Maybe one nice vaccines. geeze us michigan hate witmer trying move backwards re-opening process. People crazy. Ummm. Freedom stock market? considered things? expect rich people add smaller proportion wealth thisnyear last year? karen cook eat home? fuckig heartless. ... get tested again? Fuck noise. Chad Chemical Vs Virgin Virus m'rona. Sweden changing many recommendations already place see continued trend right now. still got make payments. also need reduce consumption want slow global warming. know never course, make sure aware excuse 20 years. clarified “free” mean insurance/government paying can’t figure actual reason people can’t wear them. It’s childish. die heparin complications, they’re COVID deaths don’t count. 

That counts win administration. Right lol don’t get wait. COVID test Toronto (negative). run overnight got results online 9am next. jam, logistics issue? enough PCR machines? don’t get problem can’t fixed throwing money it. sentiment, oh, maybe 60% sub hardily agree with. EVENTUALLY Here's tutorial become Lol imagine worried getting fever... Idiot.  Someone release Dick Butkus clones vault. Believe hate Trump ever used Nazi symbols? Generic Eagle thing people said looked like Nazi eagle eagles American well. 

Trump says plenty stupid shit, need stretch truth call out.

Or call I'm dumb missed something. turn furries into? Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said, sacrifice people economy

I see rushing nearby covid unit breath take one team - know good country. Britain bastion science innovation. God love country - *even government bit shit.* Nah there's nothing would stop getting infected. boost immune system somehow would mean infected body better able prevent virus hijacking cells making tons copies itself. things support immune system function though. Common sense stuff like exercising avoiding vitamin/mineral deficiencies.
   Agreed (that's saying). Masks? said virus widespread since March, it’s July now. immunity lasted 3-4 months, we’d starting see earliest possible re-infections. would really see happening now. don’t necessarily think lack seeing offers much comfort.

That said too, still think vaccine would game changer, even you’re immune 3-4 months, everyone immune *at time* theory virus hits brick wall destroyed maybe entire regions. Perhaps still eradicated together immunization pushed hard enough.

So there’s still reason feel hope. GOP leaders head White House ~~virus~~ election crisis deepens. 

**FTFY**. International agree, especially Norwegian. Swedish articles part parrots official FHM line. Even DN carries opinion piece researchers dare challenge FHM’s approach media ended making fun hair one researchers. surprised experience. Maybe type gotcha articles negativish (but nothing dare published Swedish strategy, FHM Tegnell), fluff pieces anyway impact.  beg works. I’ll suck vaccine. Given obviously pressing need vaccine, phase III trial go X number trials participants get covid, they’ll see difference get vaccine control

As long term data, one “wait see” situations Branson, Lake Ozarks, guess St. Louis arch? Dear Florida, keep you. Lol that's low estimate Florida. We're nowhere near bad get rate they're going. fair 'as early as' ton wiggle room. Missing September actually invalidate timeline. can't wait hear argument take vaccine whole wearing mask fiasco rich, politician, athlete...the fall sometime

If not, probably early 2021. Take Zinc EGCG. need info, provide it. Science rules!!! Human history* Damn, thank you, notice... Russia chad they're stealing vaccine [they already legally can. Phase 3 largely real-world efficacy means worse situation is, faster go.

If innoculate bunch people area low rate transmission, takes get high confidence interval one's getting sick anyway. area ravaged (US, Brazil, India, etc), one getting sick experimental group identified high confidence lot sooner. kind silver lining US Brazil stupid. siuuu fans back stadiums football , meeting friends , life hopefully gonna improve, 2020 second half comeback They’ve ordered French German vaccines too, well Imperial College vaccine multiple vaccines use different type technology. Multiple doses often required may need different, permanent vaccines Oxford one wears trial. isn’t trial. 

This quarantine. It’s guilt innocence. positive test results. It’s public health. Anybody thinks irrational honestly quite dumb.

I work hospital, we're kind swamped covid-19 patients right even probably wait small bit time taking vaccine (assuming job require take ASAP).

It almost certainly safe, would prefer wait see bit. Yep. That’s title says, “Sunday record.” People usually wait Monday, start work week, get tested. Maybe meant “The South rise again.” much speculation. anything, India way better mortality rates recovery rates. God, fucking hope so! Problem Americans looking magic bullet, example vaccines lockdown, instead little things improve situation little bit part improving situation others. start calling us control group. far great job proving masks help stop spread. urgent care think scam. exploitation poorer uninsured. Interesting 70% side effects. I'm trial, sister (we work London hospitals) neither us fever headache. Might control group meningitis jab supposed cause similar side effects vaccine Yeah, SCIENCE!! Pepperidge Farm remembers. old cell phone SIM card around apartment somewhere, work? order special one Microsoft? fair mom least 4 types cancer, said swimming river running pesticide trucks went city. kids used run pesticide spray cool down. article keeps saying shortness breath considered one main symptoms, sounds absurd me. feel like three main symptoms fever, cough, shortness breath. anecdotal part, theres limited evidence airborne (as compared larger droplets, regular masks protect against) except extreme situations like invasive airway procedures.

Source- taken care hundreds Covid patients simple mask (not n95 except special exceptions) 2 neg antibody tests, symptoms. Three 100 co workers confirmed infections similar circumstances. Conclusion- people arent adhering masking

Edit: suggestion rare constructive criticism I've changed post attempt clarify medical jargon. realise one wears mask Denmark, Norway Finland either right? seem affect countries use masks.

Not even going touch rest comment since nothing Sweden. Sweden's health agency always planned avoid waves countries start see open up. reducing Sweden's curve ""Just data trends downwards presently"" dishonest best. weeks MONTHS without change policy. me, story keep changing suit victim narrative they’re trying pull off? 

it obvious read-between-the-lines way first quoted statement read going attempt travel despite diagnosis sizable anti-American sentiment Ecuador...some justified, much. I've warning anyone avoid taking pleasure watching States get knocked peg. shit hits fan there, absolutely splatter zone. Hell...the Dollar currency 20 years. markets vital economy, never mind remittances immigrant labor. declining US demand global oil prices? flowers sold? Yes, many: one properly added list: 15min see slide says clearly mål = flockimmunitet

Which crystal clear: goal = herd immunity. Note SVT mic foreground. Oh good. It’s finally over. Surely happy medium somewhere “exploited” pampered air conditioning 24/7? know downvoted. right. Tourists? country even allowing international travel right now? can’t wait this!!! seems like conspiracy explain away evidence worldview virus wrong. though, normalized mask wearing flu season would help much. depends municipality. region live bylaw, person wearing mask gets fined, business doesn't. next county though public health order businesses make sure customers wear masks get fined. Doug Ford far refused make province wide mask order. dad local driver US, still goes several hours away different states often. He's religious mask hygiene, okay far.

He says worries people interact stops. get close enough people hand paperwork whatnot, they're rarely wearing masks. *still* gets lot weird looks incredulous ""Oh, bad there?"" really think without assistance government, established os happening big pie sky dream world. Disney recently purchased 20th Century Fox $71.3 Billion. time recoup money. Disney company reinvests profits keep company moving forward. Everyone top took paycuts, even forgoing pay year order pay longer anyone else did. continue support staff healthcare insanely expensive even best group discounts, continue offer college support (every single Disney CM access free college education). completely possible perfect world scenario dont perfect world. working continue implore government support anyone stay afloat safely possible.


Edit add: dont forget actually laws place publicly traded company shareholders wishes. even reinvest profits crazy money laying around CEO could shareholder approval would breaking law went them.


Edit clarify: Disney paid employees almost month stay home. company that, chose to. like said everyone top took paycuts forgoes pay fund this. wait, 10k cases 5 days 10k day 5 days surprised aren’t setting border swapping points truckers canada drive past border tyvek suit wear respirator drop trailer let us driver take back sterilizing trucks return looks like there'll one two early runners right? might see Oxford one October (UK) we're hoping give enough protection last 12 months ish. Soon following (early next year), we'll start see ICL vaccine used kind ""booster"", keep immunity up. 

I suppose issue going crazy mutations, stop developing adequate levels protection, hopefully years away treatments (see study UK today Protein treatment) virus small enough amount people control manage well. 

It really interesting case shining light onto world stage - people stood made country, professions wider society proud. others lied, cheated (hopefully) subject investigation / accountability future Wrong. Fauci still hypocrit fact right. part problem. good Trump gone soon :D study scheduled come today weeks also complaining Brazil, India, Russia, UK, you’re concerned numbers. that's scary. even everyone wearing masks? Dude...I can't even begin develop thought address comment video. Totally flabbergasted exactly. feel bad people forced back governors aren’t willing thumb nose federal government 7% budget. fucking boomer still good news green light progress larger trials early process. 🤦🏻 fun fall. time election season? many deaths? higher education institutions getting hammered COVID research hugely impacted Brexit.  


I'm sorry say, glory days over. Challenge trials happening far know, waiting ethical approval last heard think ways, starting what's going Portland right now...  insistence waiting government NGO make recommendations taking preventative measures ridiculous. Sure, maybe avoid spraying toxic chemicals everywhere sanitize space there's official word safety efficacy, working home? Wearing masks? Limiting people office? every single company taking relatively easy measures? ugly truth care anything bottom line. Yes. They’re supposed take public transport without notifying someone. read article. Seems entirely reasonable. 

And mention ambulance- people don’t hop randomly bus stops. call them. come house. *on phone* *again person* ask exposure. delay it. Nah what’s ordered UK UK. They’ve ordered French, German Imperial College vaccine well use boosters Oxford vaccine wears Wanna feel old? Jaws came 45 years ago. DeSantis 41 years old. Motherfucker never learned. I’m anti-vaxx means (fuck every single one people), vaccine going proper testing? hope it’s safe. didn’t want prioritize economy? makes depressed well, shittards keep posting wedding photos /r/aww I'm covid 19 survivor getting headaches 4 months since ""recovery"". One headache one fever avoid months seemingly unending illness cognitive distress... sounds like brainer. gosh Florida Man ruining things everywhere idea hospitals world, including staff janitors, conspiracy, make trump look bad, irrational hurts head,, especially considering hospitals hurting financially every incentive make covid look better is, worse. 

And, what's conspiracy? Completely fabricate global pandemic (or unleash virus world) wait trump act like trump? I'll fuck sonic hedgehog seems like fair trade Agreed. Vaccine good news. cells good news. #HUGE would mean accepting masks work

I’ve doubt there’s behind scenes shit they’ll make mint, probably revealed months cronies dumped money medicinal corporation PPE manufacturing firm made profit Money printer go brrrrrr Hydroxycloriquine ""approve use"" US.

It's approved long ago specific uses, totally valid uses, benefits outweight risks.

You seem confuse ""Trump spewing bullshit"" ""vaccine testing standards"".

Turns scientific community rigorous con man. would thunk. nice day.  US clinical There's broad range shit force employees health safety. 

That correct. lot laws regulations support ""broad range shit"", exist masks. 

Take something like seatbelts instance. regulations defines ""seatbelt"". scientific studies back seatbelt needs installed, tested, materials used, etc.. cannot use piece yarn claim seatbelt. 

Where masks? need treat wearing masks seriously wearing seatbelts. means passing actual laws specific mask use, mayor governor ""declaring"", ""suggesting"", ""urging"", bunch wishy-washy terms mask wearing. bigger cities probably really, know couple students countries speak German also got jobs, except elderly people pretty much everyone speaks least English. 
But personal quality life would likely improve drastically speak language least start taking courses there. 
I'm sure permanent residency though - know girl moved Vietnam mandatory reach certain language level took language integration courses here, also qualify highly skilled labourer. learned German crazy fast though, even first came wanted everyone talked German started course still living Vietnam. Sadly shocking me. think elite white house without masks staying healthy? always like always be. you’re saying wouldn’t chose work someone else unless forced threat austerity? watch much tv. shop Aldi they've pushing masks entire time Like miracle, disappear. Back know effective afraid that, not, could potentially cause cases people habit touching mask touching thing around. Back thats lockdowns mask policy. know effectiveness mask worth possibility someone touches touch things around. quote this, basically reason masks effectiveness revised professionnals didnt recommend masks back ""wrong"" per say since nothing supporting masks wearing back then. understanding virus evolved lot month. Oh no, thousands people dying every day people even able watch football that's happening? live south Texas I'm always surprised lot people seem little tolerance heat. Like, 95 there's shade, get it. lot people want AC blasted time. guess criticize given lack resistance cold. ""I contract already spent advance. least play even means wasting thousands tests. Football, America! Football, Money! Football, Freedom!"" say anything getting disinfectant powerful light inside body? getting downvoted this? can't many patients transferred New Mexico NM department health would kicking shitstorm were! 

Its important read articles. patients recorded New Mexico's hospital hidden all. likely actually, literally fewer people getting sick Arizona. Peak commercial activity three weeks ago! last guy one assume used steroids. seems like bad cases bodybuilder type guys. Steroids cause hypertension suppress immune system. I'm trying downplay virus think possible ""healthy-looking"" shape guys actually healthy. I'd like add demented ideology make harder pull bootstraps too. refuse increase minimum wage housing cost living goes up. actively making insurance expensive trying kill ACA without replacement. time giving rich tax breaks tax havens. 

Prove actually care AVERAGE Americans. NFL exactly famous caring players safety. fans die, what's them? They'll re-open optical measures place feign safety protocol. let nature course count cash. It’s still apart virus numbers, though. I’m creating conspiracy here, I’m genuinely wondering they’re counting numbers towards it’s still statistic count. wouldn’t NM’s number count case didn’t happen here. First off, purpose response?

From Wikipedia:

A known left-wing controlled easily edited website.

Wikipedia considered automatic failure considering providing source information papers many schools. 

If correct right-wing, would consider using expose situation public pressure action? exposed medical issues past. 

Perhaps could contact Wikipedia investigation. care exposes gets corrective action started. you? it’s permanent organ damage... bowed hours ago. Enjoy! Close Diseasny World probable side effects vaccines rarely harmful side effects?

Could also contender unexpected health concerns? much agree. can't blame party. country great advancements things really blame selves. eye opener better educating American people. pandemic shown lack education people dont believe covid. one man used advantage. Though climate change likely kill us all, wasnt referring it.

You're dissatisfied Biden's policies. I'm sure want go left right more, regardless he's want doing. sounds like like Trump either.

So going vote someone else, potentially left right, despite knowing win. matter, assume point give credibility parties potentially make progress future.

Except never happen Trump elected. never get changes want Trump wins second term. Democracy America dies moment parties forth irrelevant.

You voted nothing, achieved nothing, gotten nothing, never get anything again.

Because seriously dude, he's already rolling quasi secret police ignoring court orders. think happen he's given another 4 years corrupt system? Thanks! somehow missed that. 1,077 pretty good sample-size.  response instead sacrifice lives, ultimately kill suffocate economy anyway. high profile leaders still fail see can't healthy economy without healthy people! -\_\_\_\_\_\_- True, lot people also used inside AC blasted complain like, 80 degrees.  1077 believe Boring politics (and media, frankly) sounds wonderful. different time?

Look much struggle eradicate polio. turns science fairly easy (now, least), public health challenge actually getting people vaccinated remote, poor politically unstable areas world really difficult task now. Shout folks AstraZeneca also part collaboration Oxford. bullshit vaccine surely developed Europe Asia, open source manufactured little world... cost us $2k per dose something require 2 3 boosters.

This exactly Healthcare damn expensive US. People get it, clear. usually stagger recess. Everyone doesn’t go once. seem understand - would fit criteria Nobel would awarded.

A Peace Prize possible - one medicine would bit farce. feel way, suppose want people take seriously, come cost distorting facts. Good luck stay healthy! need flat-Earthers set! Wow make penis bigger too?  assuming resources could used develop working one instead

A valid concern. think (might wrong this) Oxford one one using adenovirus vector hopefully case issue.  U.S. already secured 300M doses though. age 9 must wear mask class everything except ""high intensity"" aerobic portions class

So preventions mean nothing virus stay air hours. That’s tooth. There’s ever one. Insurance companies charging copays covid treatment feds printed money give hospitals pay people without insurance. FYI.  Yes, take vaccine gets approved use US (like hydroxyclorquine was).  

I understand something arguing about. Roger Stone freed 6 months ahead schedule. Makes sense wait election, win lose. stone might made long US prison high risk age. course, people choose wear masks protect themselves, ones likely catch disease. Since mask-wearing become polarized, lot people seem one political persuasion. sure also reasons people choose wear masks. probably lead fewer conspiracy theories definitely fewer deaths US. Yet covid crisis seen staggering mind-blowingly horrific event, rather annoying boring endless drag. feels like frog mildly warm water? mean, perfectly warm water. mean slightly warm water. mean - oh wait! Vanessa Guillen promising it? think curve trending downward? without external force working it, curve go one direction. 

Did South Carolina something 2 weeks ago would flatten curve today? aware anything done there. 

Without concerted action human population, virus control. I'll probably end going route 'the lesser 2 evils', highly likely vaccine. I'll doubt feel relaxed extra data comes out, I'm sure available mass public. guess days least know ingredients pretty safe vaccines aren't, that's plus. 1. might need 2 doses/person spaced weeks apart provide best immunity.
2. Even need them, like 40 million extra doses go waste. Countries around world pay top dollar buy hands.
3. Contingency planning. know know, better need need it. turn flight mode soon loaded  Yeah...I know 'contain' thing. lockdown largely contained here, eased bam outbreaks.

In Germany, temperatures par Northern states. hottest states basically stay indoors summer getting hit. suspect areas really smart containing this.   think Global News English press. Vacuuming forests perhaps? im seriously waiting either unzip human mask reveal lizardman, hence malevolence mankind. Americans thank god isnt zombie apocalypse seem recall 30 million UK asap others come later, sure optimal dose, could different different ages im central florida next door neighbors got tested day. wife got results back pretty fast, tested negative then. spoke, husband received yet, though went time. symptoms. isolating now, wonder results actually come back  reports vaccine available early September work out, good. Also every single country world control, nobody it.

but yeah whole america pretty stupid... knew beforehand know joking, point winter better viruses.

Cold weather helps prevent degeneration RNA outside body. Therefore, surface contamination lasts significantly longer. Fair enough. mostly Sweden full brainlets. worried worried community,"" said. ""It’s like take one neighbor wear mask.""

Why start stupid fuck husband anti-mask months back, still posts disdain gone on, still hate masks. it’s aggravating me

Clear example even love one literally faces possible death urgent care, fucks still care. already started. Results expected sometime September PHASE 2 next yesss John McAfee quote (from - coinnewsspan?) subreddit pushed reddit quality content coronavirus news?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* people need hear going listen Companies take seriously s*** ton answer Nobel prize worthy, imo. call people wear mask's racist. [I virus, work) taking people like video. Sometimes hug worth thousand words. think serious video edit cause people thought serious. Look below. There’s already massive teacher shortage, way things now, doubt many rushing get teaching license get classroom. aware. would also assume 190m go Deparment International Development get vaccine places Africa even says airborne.

But, specifically state cannot ruled out. total utter bullshit.  


I promise hospitals making bank people covid, real fake. Aye, twisted bending laughing dumbfuckistanis still realising dumb are, even getting hit badly.

It's like watching dumb drunk drivers making jokes plummeting cliff. real prison fear, real freedom freedom fear. I’ve saying since first week March. Certain vaccines require one dose produce decent immunity. idea street value would Miami right now? Yeah. absolutely find abominable every level. Actually boost benefits would help stonks. they're shooting thing always. Land, residential housing, commercial real estate pennies dollar. Nobody noticed much insanely wealthy people got 2009 financial collapse. 

The best sources passive income are.... dividends, real estate, owning business. U.S. forget states act together. Sweden bit outlier regarding Covid Norway Denmark low infection rates due early effective restrictions, people following them. gradually re-open controlled way. think anyone's beat yet spikes happened places people thought gone before. COVID-related death, people trying explain can't anything ON/OFF brain, sit defending idiocy making. coronavirus vaccine developed University Oxford appears safe trains immune involving 1,077 people showed injection led making antibodies white blood cells fight findings hugely promising, still soon know enough offer protection larger trials UK already ordered 100 million doses vaccine.

Hot damn. This. New York buddy living life normal - mask. 

I get New York handled virus pretty well... almost every one neighbors not. Viruses spread. 🙃 Sorry hear it...

Stay safe. Rest peace dude :( Indoor dining here. Nebraska. One thing I'll always proud country quality higher education institutions nothing else bro-in-law talking infected. saying prevent getting infected first place. pesky problem 30%~ population braindead. DeSantis letting virus kill traditional Republican voters demographic. don’t understand isn’t save fellow Floridians, it’s really insane he’s doing. maybe, maybe, never COVID first place wording headline like intentional pretty shitty journalism. believe it’s peer reviewed That's because, I'd guess 60% population believes either hoax merely overhyped. reach numbers, outrage gonna happen. HAPPY GLORIOUS  Yep. sticking fingers ears screaming “fake news” brain power muster. I'm problems data match many state's site.

&amp;#x200B;

Here shows 9070 deaths P&amp;I Sept 29 - July 06

[Here final report 2018-2019 Sept 30 2018 - Sept 26 2019. shows 10020 deaths.

To give perspective close normal is, thru end July 2019 [9249 P&amp;I wonder latest data shift CDC WH anything it. Yup. tried state well. go quite well -- well, least get within hare's breadth holding governor gunpoint State police looked on. 

Without national testing strategy, state -- even decent plan-- fully absorb fallout stupidity states surrounding it. Unfortunately, getting national plan January 20, 2021, earliest. jobs going let stay home wait. It’s messed up. Fake news someone warned Ohio. Don’t know anywhere else, seem lot uninsured people here. record breaking?? weeks, convinced kill people live coasts.  tons old buildings filled retirees could torn land sold. Florida flooded rich Russians buying whole blocks beachfront property. isn’t much left old people giant condos, guess wasting it. land priceless.  Covid wiped large swaths could finally tear dinosaurs. killing voter base smart? Russians could probably hand presidency silver platter 2024. Or, maybe it’s cash transaction.  theory. egomaniac admit wrong matter what? I’m honestly surprised it’s higher US 4 million cases point deserve pity. voted governors, voted president, knowing unfit actual serious situation.

And are. president still acting like nothing happening. Sunday always falls.. talking about, euro trash? Oh get it, bad, seems way overblown 

From earlier thinking downplaying virus, bad. death rate still doesn’t look bad, that’s despite fact they’re attributing every possible death covid read ? didn’t COVID time everyone sure anything. easier judge retrospectively. post nothing US healthcare system? wildly accurate.

Even marketed postcard image 'Vermont town general stores' replaced dollar generals, walmart, mcdonalds.

I born 88' here, rural, country part state. call Vermonter, meant Vermonter dead point; culture gone, replaced /r/LateStageCapitalism desperate quiet poverty. natives(if call that) born 80's fled state desperation, parents cling little wealth able acquire children born.

The state paints pretty picture itself, every multi-million dollar estate Shelburne, Stowe, Charlotte, Addison, hundred broken cobbled homes 60's, nearly every town least one trailer park. talking different things. Israel opened universities high schools. closed Sweden would probably spread covid stayed open. UK said would vaccine September March, think anything would sidetrack unless get evidence really bad. That's sad Dear Americans, fucking **criminal**
get fucking head ass, start putting real criminals jail. (most GOP'ers) targeted harassment. Please stop. Nothing article states Covid time   something never happened (aside much smaller Obama payment) unusual, synonym strange. certain non-essential industries received unprecedented demand unable supply without delays, certainly abnormal. guess unusual, unprecedented abnormal strange 👍 different states set federal govt can’t easily mandate things federally. countries set differently Right gunshot wound go hospital full cancer patients die, ""cancer-related death"".

Sorry. seems stupid me. Ok? Man, obese, bordering morbidly obese absolutely thought moderately overweight never fat dad many men grew around. also kind crept me, definitely start fat, even actually pretty fit highschool even college. Eventually got point changes made kind continue autopilot. look, *really* easy fat really realize it, especially *everyone else around also fat*. Oh way New York’s population density 414 people per square mile Florida 404 👍🏽 Well, tbf Sweden's numbers show decline caseload last couple weeks, along decline test positive rate well. indicator truly declining burden infection. great! said, admit *fully* trust numbers anymore, there's many [lies many errors 

If decline real: could contributing disease primarily spreading younger cohorts go testing mild cases. Also, weather. Even though last couple weeks cooler May/June, still summery. Also Swedish summer holiday *sort of* like lockdown way: basically children school, many (maybe even most) adults work. cities empty people leave countries summer homes country side. goes around 3-4 weeks. vacations bit staggered, (I think) happen July. think probably biggest factor decline. 

I think declines real 'only' 100-900 cases per day, build Test, Trace, Isolate infrastructure could *potentially* keep situation somewhat control fall hits. They'll never shut imo; unless government collapses replaced imo FHM's top officials also fired replaced. *probably* introduce masks fall ever, much likely lockdown. mean it’s pretty much mandatory every know part US... Go SCIENCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! heaven exists guy earned ticket Probably local lockdown may needed. Atm, officials trying use tighter restrictions see reduce infections without lockdown. Cute fear mongering. Try use logic, actually think. People keep pointing CDC data match many states data. Texas's health portal shows around 10k die year pneumonia influenza season (which runs September thru September) Depends country likely, literally hundreds millions doses developed right now. idea if/when it’s approved it’s ready distribution immediately. Wide scale public, timeline January likely correct, lots folks getting earlier that. Again, based idea thst everything works perfectly out. would work south Texas September. Maybe even October. almost always get heat advisories. think northern states would similar, opposite problem winter months. Crappy headline - makes sound administration attempting defund (which surprise either). Defund White House. Good, put money working class people  Agreed So, less people line get vaccine ? Survival fittest ? Seems pretty good me. both? Get sick, go hospital, go home dead giant bill. Cries uninsured US love KLB, might ready. She’s never worked state federal level.

I’d prefer see run governor couple years, maybe run President, Senate, take VP spot. Exactly. masker friends co-workers. keep telling eventually likely find already loved ones close friends die feel pretty bad thinking maybe killed them. surprise me, honestly. We've already politicized kind car drive, kind exercise sport like do, kind foods eat, etc. seems logical wearing mask would receive similar treatment. mean, obviously bullshit. modern American way... What?

Health insurance companies benefit HEALTHY patients, pay premiums every month never high bills insurance company pay. People chronic illnesses cost lot money people without them. 

People dying COVID bought life insurance policies last year even earlier, COVID even heard of. 

The US population struggling dip, rise. People fewer children used to, more. Sweden still won. that’s case, sub better praise NY efforts seeing they’re worse Sweden department well. LOL. Lol logical world makes sense. reality billionaires, millionaires, athletes celebs get first, peasants they're lucky. Sad true. Sold $89M market cap around $37B. That's execs paying themselves, fleeing sinking ship. California median age 36.7. comparison, Italy 47.3. might play part success story, no?

And yes, UK fucked big time. think trying bring attention dangers laser-focus approach dealing covid could neglect patients different health problems.

From article: ""Research Health Data Research UK, national institute health data science, warned overwhelming focus Covid-19 likely cause 18,000 excess cancer deaths. said could almost double 35,000 worst-case scenario."" like guy died car accident reported die covid?? universal knowledge tat virus become politicized... asshole convention Tennessee last night:    AFAIK John Radcliffe hospital Oxford testing ground. sociopath?

A sociopath term used describe someone antisocial personality disorder (ASPD). People ASPD can’t understand others’ feelings. They’ll often break rules make impulsive decisions without feeling guilty harm cause.

People ASPD may also use “mind games” control friends, family members, co-workers, even strangers. may also perceived charismatic notice. Believe me, people company notice. usually locked room side somewhere, different building, even outsourced, don’t see thank person, believe say know good job, much appreciate it. Honestly, get it. everyone else keeps going back “well said this”. fucked up, sure, it’s reason keep condoning others continuing fuck up. dignity. don’t expect understand. obviously invested belief struggling splurging bullshit generally living wrong; makes feel deserving comfort. Hopefully never face various life circumstances would quickly show wrong join chorus “but everything right!” smug, well-fed assholes patronize spending. working whole time sign letting 50 dysfunctional countries inside bigger dysfunctional country. lol didnt start wintertime?  dude tell people saved would kill economy...  guess system built debt better keep feeding natural solution...

 Yea... $600 go toward dividend earning investment... best buy new phone complain broke time's get rough. 

The person conversations work little better reddit ones perceived personal attacks 99% time. mean “politics aside”? Politicians directly responsible conditions described. reality doesn’t mean it’s apolitical.  Worse. third world countries something akin handle this.  better reward reddit gold? I'm pretty sure HoH folks probably use sign language, alternate means, communicating HoH folks. that's purely uneducated supposition, honest. indoor dining still THING establishments.....What fuc serious question - go news covid? hate sub still follow sometimes feel like perpetual negativity balanced somewhat basis realism. able compete Apple Khaganate Free Internet's Republic Google. follow guidelines influenza wuhan coronavirus currently recommended everywhere? sure two article said side effects things like fever headaches bad side effects!  people really need taught exponentials watching prelude Legend Fair point I’ve read manufacturing vaccine could tune 100s millions doses short term (1 month). major fda approved facilities large capacities ready go. Yea, greatest shock. Seeing pro life friends church care.

Edit say, care, mean refuse wear mask people. I'm aware deployed, there's reason believe going wind like field hospitals hospital ship deployed New York never wound used months ago. Also, Ecuador issues bearing U.S. Yes, I’d like help US too! Hmu hear more, please? American, I'm surprised took world long realize that. Yeah thanks, I’m anti vaccine idea vaccine unknown long term effects doesn’t sit right me
Or maybe know long term side effects work began years ago? live Dallas seen actively enforced once. police, individual businesses. need something like r/coronavirusRIP, every death get obituary thread, people could post tributes ways person touched another's life, kind thing. I'm sorry. I'm weary EVERYTHING Donald Trump. Can't discussion wonderful news without ubiquitous Trump getting yet unwarrented attention? goes without saying Trump administration would better suited circus work. everyone Reddit feel compelled make damned day talking ad nauseam? Again, apologize. who's fed Trump; me. sister, generally good person, believed Facebook bullshit read, came it. poorly. refuses go hospital. declining rapidly.

I'm 200 miles away, wondering conversation last conversation her.

I can't even.... *laughs POTS/EDS*

Now they'll know pain.  Aw wish 18 sign Yeah seems legit 🙄 people notice. county commissioners cancelled meetings took 6 week hiatus need most. determine emergency CARES funding spent missing action. surly teens yell balcony going hospital, white coat, ""Flied (sic) rice steamed rice?""

I think yell back ""This Panda Express!"" ""In Earnest"" said 2 weeks vacation absolutely reason 6 figure salaries middle global meltdown... pardon - fuck no.  Whats 10 days people getting together drinking Pandemic... say masks work. I'm saying panacea people making be. may help, scientific studies showing this? panning numbers (masked countries vs unmasked generally overall). lumped young. Mainly im 30 want think old lol working powerfully Rawanda hope goes court this. seems like look numbers everybody else draw different conclusions based different biases ideal world competent leadership NY would worst provided every state data needed prepare state's response. Instead stuck fingers ears said ""lalalala hoax can't hear you!"" woefully unprepared. [official original paper want read.  China recommending masks.

When government officials telling us wear masks ""ineffective preventing spread Coronavirus,"" guess called bluff bought masks?

CHYYYYNA

Funny story, masks getting May/June, actually crossed Pacific Ocean three times. China US, back China Feb/Mar, back US May/June. sorry loss. ❤️

I say Facebook culling know real friends bit more. mean, he's right sense MAGAtards exactly core demographic applying passports go abroad. Unfortunately Governor Abbott around 3 months late mandate Texas. Previously told individual county could mandate masks public, realized aggressively cases spiking without mandate, eat words sign executive order mandating masks worn public. supported counties mandating masks needed beginning, Trump wanted guniea pig state see ""open"" summer would look like. read other's lips, they'll still problems communicating anyone wearing clear mask. really recommend companies get clear masks people working public facing positions like including cashiers. Everything we're experiencing right now, we're experiencing consent politicians.

We opposition party represents us.

And real recourse. know get state look like I'm Walton Bezsos.

I'm sorry going DMs open need someone talk to. phase 3. Safety determined need drawing like children’s book apparently. fucking shock feel reading someone considered friend show annoyance need continue ""dealing with"" this. even know respond, honestly. people post ""Wear mask everyone &lt;3"" publicly. 

 course say publicly, want look like assholes strangers. wealthy country modern medical care available. 

No different Middle Ages practice. hope friend's uncle right. Yikes can't imagine looking job NYC plus y'alls cost living seems high. I'm sure lot people still dealing aftermath big outbreak too. Sometimes takes week two covid patient die. Meanwhile staff exhausted enough PPE working endless shifts save lives! hospitals starting fill covid patients now, wait weeks math. called emergency preparedness. goal comes faking higher numbers would use enforce stricter lock down, showing interest doing. reason fake higher numbers lot interest faking lower numbers I’ll happy say it’s low cost free lie. heard this. going best times, specially last week, i've seen hospitals handling like champs. ICUs still available Cundinamarca (the state).
I'm Colombia. live pandemic day day since close relative taking care hospital move others hospitals tests exams (non related COVID. diabetic bad cut leg). also read everyday least 3 newspapers listen news radio every morning. Tell 16 year old girl California killed stress relating lockdown. Please tell changing often though tasks? cross contaminating. fun thing it'll never ruled out. length time keep getting longer. Found bar owner.  Like what? Prohormones? Non-medical face masks dont work hardly great people say do. Back March, said masks necessary CDC said medical grade, basically shit. Cloth masks (non-medical) sign compliance, true medical/health safeguard. bandaid solution there's true vaccine, shitty temporary antibody treatments Perfection!! Well..lets face it, many african american communities grandpas grandmas alive remember horrible things done medicine african americans. part distrust based that. Also, late adopter type makes sense hold off. see coming from. Want see safe. social distancing comes time carrying virus recover without infecting others. Pharmacists also **criminally** overlooked. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* God fucking sucks man. yeah get perspective. I've essential since started I'm tired. Tired stressed health stressed people doing. I'll hold breathe.  friend friend collapsed going run day. Brain dead life support now. healthy underlying conditions relatively mild illness March, 38 years old. real. lot excess mortality officially attributed COVID among people 45, many 13 every COVID death theory herd immunity come faster expected anti-mask Karens MAGAmen catch COVID, main spreaders. depends strong long-term immunity is, point suspect. Right really don’t know behave like flu shot...different strains what. care extent, she'll spread virus people actually able get vaccine. started vaccine decade ago SARS 1 Thank you. took benadryl see allergies. dont normally get seasonal allergies, im antibiotics rn though maybe immune system lacking. I'll try rinse see clears. Im really glad hear im one though. good thing established distribution systems CDC well funded. /s refer jab? That's 2nd article I've seen call that. get technically correct description seems technical given context articles Hindsight 20/20 say white students exempt. They’re selling profit anywhere. Price equivalent $2.80 uk eu awful what? people dying home, especially older people live alone. get scared go ER mild symptoms, gets bad quickly. always thinking clearly grip fever. Yeah think Nov we’d get vaccine health care workers. Probably January start seeing released public large French Vanilla, two bacon rolls shot pepper spray, please. Based governor Atlanta expand cannot charge recommended vaccines ACA I’m throwing something there, vaccine can’t developed herd immunity isn’t possible, expect get control get back semblance normal ever?
E.g. sporting events, weddings, parties, etc.? still blows mind confident people like nonsense spewing.  know, certainly huge safety issue try enforce it. ridiculous expect retail workers anything it. Oh! never thought like that. Brazil Iran face similar travel bans, students nations included U.S. exemptions.

Translation: white student can't carry virus still early. money hasnt become worthless yet. looking this. Gray bear, maybe. would think breathing problems chest pain. Low oxygen levels/high heart rate. Again? LA never ""full shutdown.""  Another white person cares checking in. Kemp definitely wants kill brown people—the ultimate voter purge. Give time position politician, private citizen. try learn difference. Politicians, acting politicians, rights. Walking face shield creates air pressure differential behind mask, creating air vortex sucking even air eyes upper mask.

Think aerodynamic drag vehicle smoke tunnel.  probably still use excuse november. definitely need amount guests invitations sent time determined it'll late change things. mean next Vice President? offer free mask still wear it. already least one mask stage game, basically outed anti-mask, selfish piece shit, prick. using webtv something?  Back March waited 3 weeks test IN. end wasn’t even worth it. part. gave list. look them?

Here's one example: carnivale event German town resulting superspreading virus loves crowds. assume much outdoors. people making ad hominem attacks instead addressing content post. 

I ask consider would happen US imposed forced sterilization marginalized ethnic minority today?

Genocide Uyghur people humanitarian crisis. 

The forced labor inmates US minimal wages violation basic human rights.

Both statements true without negating other. uh theres job go back still die. governments already bankrupt.   Could include grocery store workers? kinda can't quit job. I’m cool guinea pigs.  zero desire go eat virus control. think really depends person is. Yeah Biden stutter debate vote songt fuck again. vote South Park says everybody New Orleanian here. absolutely right. perfect, hes done better lot leaders faces loads opposition state. smacked AG Landry letter. Highly recommend anyone needing laugh read it. zero Ok sure, making piece plastic difficult able it. tell mayor L.A. already ""Stay Home Order"" effect. Well, never taste amazing cheese dip. Hope it’s worth  Actually, it’s accurately stated money life. politically-biased sub aims collect disseminate information supports cause {total re-open, herd immunity, etc}. Anything challenges idea removed threads could go direction get locked.

It's similar way anti-vaxx misinformation campaigns work bad studies promoted evidence contrary suppressed. Ding ding ding. 📈⛵️ 💵 📉 see finish line comes local transmissions. Imported cases though, thats probably going go while.. tracking daily deaths 3 p.m. since beginning . claim lie. statistical upward trend deaths. flat lie.  data JHU.

edit: quick vote. hide truth. condemn large gatherings. I’m waiting... better treating now. They’ve found drugs give people chance surviving. Hear out, I'm anti-vax Im probably getting vaccine tested actually work (or little) side affects. Maybe month, I've ...so mean people keep going church wearing masks? Ok. can't that! They're rich! Laws apply them! /s seems crazy me.. living Indiana 900 new cases today 800 yesterday. reasons vaccine take time create. testing. fast. bite us ass. Finally good news! hoping praying wtf mean left Florida. It’s definitely worst thing ever see. people fucking horrible Meanwhile, two labs twice week local CC starting month today. Yeah, let's see fast takes outbreak occur.  would think normal Christmas impossible. That's entire point, know. Considering anti-maskers regularly consume particular person's bullshit, think buttworms would disgust all. Everyone bad ass untill told put mask turn little bitches haven’t mentioned political part yet.   “Oh kids fine!!”

 sigh That's measurement taken hospital ambulance. days leading feeling nice buzz  Damn, look redeeming legitimately win all. rigged election. Think great college text book scam....I'm sure publishers salivating idea selling books K-12! know one fact，the model Chinese commercial housing versy similar, large real estate companies purchasing chunk land local governments build ""Loupan""（usually size block, exceptional large Loupan Tiantong Yuan Beijing home 500k people) sell citizens. urban area, communities similar other. meant lock every one inside, original purpose prevent none real estate owner messing community. turned helpful defend coronavirus though, pose strict control communities organize food delivery efficiently. Ok that’s great, child child transmission rates? child infant transmission rates? elderly often talked vulnerable infants? Studies also classified vulnerable. know decent amount children age 10 infant brother sisters? would one classify age group attend school shouldn’t? talking like simple problem science answers right that’s case.

Also lot data points many children asymptomatic major gap studies. chance there's reliable vaccine produced September. End 2020 Germany, France, Italy, Netherlands: well 15 times better US actually pretty BAD. took 11 days get results (Florida), test 6/30.  May ask authority is?  Red hat logic mysterious sang thing head saw redditor mixed haha Thank sooo much. asymptomatic slight cough stuffy nose. Thank really helped me. Thank you. roommate made grandiose statement many people “would rather die lose lives lose businesses fostered grew”.

Don’t get wrong: work local restaurant hate what’s happening, I’ve seen business owners absolutely floored what’s going on. can’t convince literally dying existing better losing business. Texans travel everywhere though. much spawl half population drives trucks get 10 miles gallon pretty frequent stops too. Literally article post lmao.

Riiiight. actual Colombian debunked. see article, article confirm triage story. reports something families, local media vice-president Colombian Medical Federation said Palermo Clinic capital denying ICU’s patients older 75 years old.

Several families said so? said ""the hospital killed grandpa! grandpa could lived!""? said? Good enough me!

And sure ""local media"" reporting ""several families"" said, right?

And *bet* vice-president referencing local media, reporting several families said.

And adds known ""an unconfirmed story"".

So *confirmed* examples triage find entire planet past 6 months?

I mean .. surely must *something* concrete .. right? know bad spot Italy select hospitals, outside dont think heard anything. Thank UK letting us know idiots reside America. Correct. do. country. government needs step in, people need demand change way running things decades. 

However, responsibility (again) falling upon schools, woefully underfunded, overcrowded, poorly equipped handle pandemic. ""it's much! quickly test less! testing less less cases!"" /s Red hat express idea whether that's case talking ass. literally like Jim Carrey Ace Ventura: Pet Detective right now, bent using hands pull cheeks apart talk ass.

The couple wherewithal get tested prior travel first place, evidence mindset. right thinking adult would reject ankle monitor, would taken one step permanent manner.  live Ohio work PA cross back forth alot seems people sides really lacking mask wearing. ive seen someone get yelled thrown store once. (Family Dollar) island make easier stop internal spread? Update: BS wake regimes get overthrown. Yeah that’s really dumb, that’s operate here, government puts responsibility businesses individuals, cuz they’re lazy don’t wanna work extra laws. Anyway guy video perfect example quebecers become rednecks Canada, even anti mask protests day, people really dumb. guy looking stir shit couldn’t handle annoying ass fat ass red neck girlfriend step in, good riddance. Go drive next time dick head. anything like army came help Quebec, medical stuff. come try help area's healthcare system cope extreme pressure. Quebec, long term care homes (elderly). getting ravaged army sent lot staff refused work peak covid situation (our peak 1k cases per day). situation old folks homes *dire*. confirmed infections still need go hospital

Depends testing availability demographics country/state.

In Israel currently 2.4% active confirmed cases hospitalized. 

Of course many undetected infections never end hospital. never really first wave Xinjiang. 100 total cases entire region, remote sparsely populated. likely infection imported central Asia. Go take relaxing long walk. It’s nice out! Give brain break doomscrolling. again. looked (bystander effect). First I've heard it, interesting. see mean now. Yeah matter number participants, takes certain amount time observe long-term effects vaccine. know effect vaccine year administered, actually wait year. There's reason vaccines take many years develop, fast-forwarding process fraught risks. believe call lamesteeam media Deaths deaths. People decide die there's reason weekend deaths lower weekday deaths. New cases maybe, deaths trending continuously. Also, death lag everyone saying coming? Price might crazy developed outside US, diplomatic bridges burned hard lately US may also exactly first line it. Inflating currency eliminate debt rich, make stock market numbers set new records? viruses spread online call freedom. rhymes dumb. Yes should. have. turns fraught legal challenges. Andrew Cuomo raised stink RI started stopping New Yorkers.  Question vaccines - say 50% people get vaccine comes out. still effective people? I’m trying research herd immunity don’t fully understand. thing around since, lingering shortness breath terrible cough. Now, smoke way much 40, figured irritation I'm beginning think back March fucked some


I'm really scared. insurance. would nice vaccines effective enough could provide certificate says don’t wear mask willing vaccinated. could hatred mask incentive cross anti-vaxx lines. pay people get vaccinated.  idea instructor *is* interactive, spend bulk time providing constructive feedback, meeting students appointments individually, etc... rather spending time focused creating tons hours long content reading slide decks 

The real rule thumb longer six minutes, engagement drops precipitously 8-9 minutes. read originally Darby’s book Small Teaching Online, believe it’s based study: http://up.csail.mit.edu/other-pubs/las2014-pguo-engagement.pdf

Online whole different ball game. People get easily bored distracted. 

I teach pretty “easy” area, hard 6 minutes less. complex topics take 3-4 videos written content thrown too. Nearly Central Florida depends traffic Disney. Disney absolutely essential business without it, many mouths eat, rent/mortgages go unpaid, layoffs closures supporting businesses. massive industry. alternate reality President Hillary Clinton providing funding schools meet administrations guidelines requirements in-person schooling. However, schools taken opportunity (and funding) modernize learning, empower low-income rural areas access highspeed broadband necessary equipment at-home schooling. 

President Clinton gave education facelift put teachers/students place succeed years come! People Texas hard time this... makes angry. true statements. Six weeks long time 76k infections day. share border country thousands undocumented people come annually. NEVER get 0 COVID cases. aren’t island. Even transmission 0, don’t know what’s brought across borders without us knowing. Hopefully vaccine gets control. not, it’s going play naturally. coming someone parents immunocompromised. know need find normalcy again. Effective vaccine letting play options. late. Republican party stood enabled mess. alternative presidential candidates: get votes. deadlines passed, even US willing throw rules window would argue earned salvation. made bed, lie hope wake new day. Stop mask shaming us. know leadership entirely comprised idiots current growth rate, confirmed cases look doubling every 16 days. Huge grain salt (because growth rate confirmed cases almost certainly going remain constant variety reasons), ~350,000 current confirmed cases, cases doubling every 16 days, total population 22 million, we’d looking little three months everyone Florida would confirmed case. national movement national leader  take numbers full face value imo. need wait 6 months see many heal. third one referring to, appears anecdotal. That's death tolls really telling full story. last Friday, UK pretty much opposite. reporting death COVID even bloke shot face. They're trying preserve freedoms. already said best way, wear masks wear masks. cases dropping y’all setting record cases literally every day? get advertisers directly companies site/youtube/podcast popular enough. Look podcasts manscape bluechew ad reads offensive content ad aggregate agree Seize means production? almost feel guilty much pandemic changed life better.  headlines getting chilling. shit Go, Keisha, go! count money bank hey, Disney World open! Maybe set beds Epcot Center. listened David Bowie. nah, here's order: super rich, top politicians, military, healthcare workers, 2nd tier rich, 2nd tier politicians, general public. reaching general conclusion that's wrong.

If there's 999 good people 1 bad person 100% good people die, right. However, virus doesnt discriminate, deaths pseudo random.

If there's 750 good 250 bad, 50% total population dies, see 375 good people die (who longer us) 125 bad people die.

So good people died there's still good people around  Finally, glimpse hope. really hope vaccine put end virus. Facial recognition tech would fantastic find breaking mask rules vaccine works would great blow dumbshit movement. Big wake call want vaccines Hey! Shut TN! 

But yea, TN sucks hard right now. read. Random guy reddit ""speaks authority.""

His desk. already ramping now, called risk production protected fallout vaccine doesnt pan government backing So, I've reading also hearing physicians recently yet solid indication well - and, long - immunity might effective someone gets COVID-19 infection. told earlier antibody tests positive showing negative patients, might issue T-cell response still enabled, etc. Essentially, point vaccine first comes out, need consistent followup testing determine effective seems possible duration - i.e., would need handled similar seasonal shots?

I'm curious companies working vaccines seeing testing. Cannons ready, shipmates! states pushed starting school person Labor Day. guess they'll get August push basically cleared up, would get us Sept/Oct timeframes. It'll interesting see effective actually is, long lasts kind side effects show up. sad political issue. Responding pandemic requires state direct allocate resources. inherently political issue, first foremost. thing sub “no political posts” extreme head sand silliness. We’ll use takers cover bases later. US looking like we’ll need almost 700 million doses overall early candidates seem need two doses. might call Sooner, like, shit yeah hope happens!! always liked idea bringing Smokey back “Only prevent killing old people” campaign  right. pressure push anything creates environment. could speculate. sources November would US intelligence (spies US countries) sources China December would doctors sharing concerns social media...and posts would deleted long ago Chinese government. Doctors could easily talking November Wuhan posts may gotten much attention also deleted. hope vaccine finalized election. Trump need credit this. 

Eat alive want, Trump reason rely vaccine get us mess. given credit developing vaccine watch. Good news, anti vaxxers gonna cause problems still covid free walk logic election change people get it? Nice 1) actions requiring military families torn apart, you’re patriot, piece shit.

2) keeping things open people random bullshit consumption putting cost action military non-patriotic gets

Fuck Abbott. Tell actor leg chopped off, hoping lung chance bots? Keeping bars closed problem. Keeping schools closed is. That's insane. country this? Nurses risk assistant assistants make 35k year nurses get 100k. one says shit assistants. ""Nurses undervalued underappreciated"" uhhh what. posted here. Check new posts Oh god reaction people start getting vaccinated end October beginning November everything reopens second Biden inaugurated. Kentucky West VA surprised me---so far, seemingly successfully handled covids. kind states expect conformity demands masks social distancing. Maybe large rural populations, one small input... kind mystery. Talk medical provider Israel OP, would pick vaccine lottery. located. AstraZeneca already begun making doses. US gave billion dollars towards production well countries. approved millions doses immediately available. Certainly take time everyone dosed near long saying one works. Trump idiot, fraud, asshole fucking monster.

That said, mildly self deprecating joke. Thank you!!! Realistically, multiple vaccines. first one made necessarily cheapest effective. bet Canada looking southward whole continent like fuck guys plan hope allow kids high school, large disabilities still attend school.

&amp;#x200B;

the kid person even though 13+ Still require adult supervision. Yea, that's really key here. certainly would nice work 100% time, even worked day, 80% time would make world difference since sliced trough infection chains. 50% might still good enough longer self-perpetuating that's splitting hairs. know reality works? vaccine approved September leaves almost zero percent chance vaccinated October, let alone ""before October."" Miserable fool. I’m really finding sanitizer months. I’ve kind gotten used wearing gloves now. go shopping every 3 weeks. kind makes want consider Satanism money partner! Illustrious\_warthog would make great name too. Spain massive issues testing, way infected ppl. know entire families one got tested. 6 told stay home. statistics.

Germany able test trace way better. Doctors dont get paid enough live.  boost income millions people currently work? gonna trust vaccine created quickly? Honestly... can’t wait government hike prices poor die say saved world. imagine Canada (where live) would position, informed topic, assumed so. give hope thanks appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* grocers. great alive, without robust supply chain reliable deliveries fresh food, alive long. get started toilet paper... Thats really bad wonder average hospital. Lot rural hospitals lot icu beds begin with. wish could see average looks like vs now. discussing interpretation Trump's point.

I discussing it. replied bud. keep getting hungup semantics understand actual points people make, maybe go back middle school. hard understand Trump talking about, unless learning disability. I'm Canada.  need 300+ million doses countries alone. BILLIONs open global economy. 18 24 months majority people North America access vaccine. super optimistic - also reality.

I understand leading candidates produced prior Phase 3 testing complete (Thank-you Bill). assuming Phase 3 OK - given. 

But scale production unlike anything done before. talk ""millions"" available fall. tens millions hundreds millions.  

I'll set reminder comment thread 18 months say told so. Yup far between. Luckily I’m much safer area now, glad it, Tennessee still really scaring bad handling this. Remind we’ve heard story Phase III involves thousands people - around 50,000 Oxford trial. Safety issue approved. God forbid stay informed. Stay ignorant people /s unemployment supposed be


Lol, oh boy, comes average means 900-1000 per week


I know kind averages would upper bound average. ridiculous, course. 'bizzare' all. issue entirely making. lied publicly masks necessary effective worried supply. 

What's saying, honesty best policy? That’s necessarily meaningful. It’s smart diversify holdings part portfolio jumps 5x it’s standard divest reduce risk. Also, don’t know anything Moderna many startups offer stock major part compensation instead high salaries, sales might people finally chance buy house boat whatever they’ve wanted. really can't imagine ever going back things like that, even I'm vaccinated COVID-19 referred past-tense. restaurant, event, even store since March, really think could go back sort life. mean downer what's difference flu vaccine exactly? Cause lot flu vaccines arguably worth getting low chance helping.

How vaccine game changing? Many parents never make child something want sustained period time. Brilliant insight. Thanks “Just” I’d love didn’t work lol. really would like believe countries willing pay kings ransom it, think manufacturers wont oblige? Still better nothing... :P like state’s racist, vote suppressing, ignorant governor though. boat. people profits one. power choose one things, would absolutely choose vaccine.

but hey, previous poster could both, would great! Bots go elect Trump 2016 thinking instead improving arguments trying respect positions recipe political disaster. I’m Tennessee lol, know well hard tennessee sucking. shop stores this. Vote cash. addition coronavirus vaccine top many syringes use year massive 6% increase, we've already using less due putting elective procedures. moderate ramp up, what's probably already stockpiled used, good. Dr. Bright's criticisms Trump administration total shit planning even thinking things like syringes rather condemnation ability get enough them."
