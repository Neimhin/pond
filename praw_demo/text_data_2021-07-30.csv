0,2021-07-30," isn‚Äôt doctor believe bright either. people I've known done walked claiming first dose insurance. vaccine free anyone, even without insurance, pharmacist never checked further.

Again, mileage risk may vary since 3rd dose officially approved. I'm simple person, I'll follow scientists smart people safe. someone gave solution stay alive adamantly choose it, die, you. That's nothing. Im going back 3 days week August, FT office September. Yeah people gross. Sad thing is, (And hate ruin weekend fact) dumb things actually makes dumb person. I‚Äôm going kill can‚Äôt deal longer outbreak infections hospitalizations among vaccinated

What percentage everyone vaccinated?

If room full 100 vaccinated people 1 unvaccinated COVID, exactly surprise majority get COVID vaccinated... Maskless too. gofundme go along it. Biden/the CDC limit testing? remember Trump shipping many first. ""DeSantis signs executive order kill citizens."" fair, every group people well-represented initial trials ‚Äî pregnant nursing women, example. 

But idea somebody like folks article would feel need wait whole year first (if truly waiting making excuse). Tell kids without telling Stop spreading misinformation. Please read little bit vaccines, obviously know anything even though think do. I'm talking anymore troll. one side always looking next wedge issue keep side enraged engaged, easy understand. 

It's still dumb move pick something public health related like though. shots feel indeed lot misinformation starting beginning made people lose trust. 

Fauci example said masks useless work. hate say probably caused deaths thousands people allowed virus spread accelerated fashion. lab leak theory came could even bring up, even remote possibility, without alt leftist vilify wanting discuss find true origin bloody virus. lab leak theory gained lot credibility based reports I‚Äôm reading intelligence community. Smh.. Slowpoke.jpg This. People forget mRNA vaccines sort trial basis since mid 2020. Even hospitals overrun children right now, I'm sure people like would find new excuse care. massively overpopulated Michigan, wouldnt bad thing (in case). DNR sanctioned deer culls time. point. recent spike cases hardly caused blip deaths: point everyone option fully vaccinated move open up. Hey don‚Äôt discriminate, Trump went Harvard too‚Ä¶ rest case. (Psst, cuz daddy bought way school doesn‚Äôt increase IQ). Literally one saying vaccines 100% effective. fact evidence demonstrates better reducing severity virus versus stopping right. Infact encourage research viral load may significant boat hundred people it. I'm thankful men women vaccinated less risk serious effects virus.

I guess sorry keeping feelings spreading toxic misinformation. Jesus moved back year, looked like going ok. Nope. delta variant scares me, especially grandma lives family. Might wear mask double layered. That‚Äôs argument that‚Äôs law‚Äôs ok go Reminds time barber. barber go goes deer hunting, one head mounts wearing mask. They‚Äôre busy skewing butt realize what‚Äôs going around them! NYC (whose greater sphere influence encompasses almost north Jersey) first major epicenter pandemic US. couple areas Washington beat us punch first infections, NYC/NJ/CT quickly surpassed that. fact saw COVID hitting hard firsthand FOX propaganda machine got fingers situation, fact folks know least one person died given death rates higher early effective treatment plans could worked out, even conservatives jumping board vaccinations. 

Notably, South Jersey much less way vaccine mask compliance, since farther away NYC.

Source, NJ. say again. people WILLINGLY CHOOSING continue spread mutate DEADLY virus vaccine world desperate get ahold of. many extras expiring people taking it. continue put us danger EVERY DAY weaken vaccine allowing virus mutate. people murderers.

Kick rocks plague spreader. moderna? Prove it! capecodtimes.com/story/news/2021/06/11/humpback-whale-catches-michael-packard-lobster-driver-mouth-proviencetown-cape-cod/7653838002/ Repostz Yeah, get it, seems like missing greater context saying much itself. lot people vaccinated since April larger base infect we've increase cases general due summer activity, particularly July 4th probably. would naturally expect breakthrough infections, infections, long circulating community. 10x lot? get family vaccinated vacation? Free quarters!

Oh, buddy...I got bad news you... NYT WaPo literally misinformation. guess favorite cash cow isn‚Äôt around anymore need milk covid fear long it‚Äôs possible. read comments sub. doomsaying cranked 11 last days you‚Äôre hopium addicted idiot don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre fucked. valid fear given went pre-vaccine era. I‚Äôm doctor public health expert honestly would think football stadium would say ‚Äúonly vaccinated persons allowed‚Äù well would bite revenue bullet shutdown. local municipal state governments likely relying businesses take tack rather reinstate full state shutdowns. months ago, told, ‚Äúthe end sight! Get vaccinated get back normal! Don‚Äôt suffer covid fatigue!‚Äù

Well, data came today, pretty much lost hope. fatigue point. wore masks year, kept young son world first year life, got vaccinated soon could. show it? could get even vaccinated, could get decently sick, hey, there‚Äôs good chance won‚Äôt end hospital die. I‚Äôm exhausted. I‚Äôm gonna put mask again, happy lockdowns restaurant limits whatnot re-instituted. harm good point. We‚Äôre covid mode long haul, we‚Äôre going hold ride. aren‚Äôt approved age group. Probably 85% infected male.  Vaccinated not, playing tonsil hockey someone, perfect recipe transmission. CDC trying extrapolate general population kind nuts. I'm sorry hear that. gotten better months? 

The specific reason got shot avoid brain fog people report getting COVID. feel lucky get brain fog side effect vaccine looks like lot people situation. would like know timing-I would asssume 6 months 2nd shot, less? There's plenty vaccines available right now, would nice know. I‚Äôm sure who‚Äôs downvoting me, immunity dark path people neglecting acknowledge. 

Herd immunity isn‚Äôt everyone mild cases getting days. ram hospitals people dying many people dying could survived. It‚Äôs running medication treatments. It‚Äôs grim path people aren‚Äôt real it. 

Then variant comes along it‚Äôs nothing. Great! let's make schools can't force children wear pesky clothes. Parents able decide whether children go nude!  white-tailed deer we're talking here. That's relief. really need define meaning ""was"" you? guess see point view. I've thinking since read comment started wondering numbers fudged, too--numbers took granted. ""We even gotten first one!"" - much world... flu vaccine known one least effective vaccines year year due variants. least deadly treated common counter medication.  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre making Christianity better, you‚Äôre making rock roll worse.‚Äù I'm getting vaccinated covid patients.

Can imagine outcome vaccinated.

Signed life away fight covid AZ another 3 months üôÉ I‚Äôm angry you. feel betrayed parent, American, human Republicans Democrats. don‚Äôt feel represented. nation messed up. don‚Äôt invest youth. indoctrinate fleece youth. send little 4 yr olds autism war zone invisible enemy. Wtf? America? point bunch vax'd unvax'd people got infected (I read 4 5) hospitalized vax'd. many times heard vax'd might still get infected, virtually hospitalized unvax'd. certainly true here. giving 3rd shots now? Anyone half brain knows vaccinated not, going tight space shitload people stupid idea. Vaccines 100% enough people vaccine herd immunity. Play stupid games... Everyone's mental health worse. pandemic. Right? 6 month old finally going go back forth interesting one virus killing host (voter base) spreading misinformation another virus. Thousands people phase three trials vaccinated July 27, 2020. It‚Äôs literally year hasn‚Äôt news widespread delayed effects test groups. fair, people know *reasonable* hesitant (not anti-vax) worried debilitating side effect wipe population. want data first, understandable ‚Äî particularly groups like pregnant women included vaccine trials, decision carries weight.

Of course virtually every scenario, getting severe covid would WAY worse potential vaccine side effect. perfectly fine getting booster shot. means get severely ill (assuming get all) protecting others, whatever need name public health. Thank you. Yeah personally want avoid ‚Äúreduction brain gray matter one‚Äù, since I‚Äôm engineer kinda need brain stay employed. know made think  Poor animals dying due stupidity hundreds millions around globe.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* thinks CDC grossly underestimating many Americans infected.  Yes. Exactly this. constant discussion herd immunity always leaving huge factor, variants. Herd immunity, per CDC data, something probably going looking at. need move away idea. There's reason prominent doctors discussing real option, not. thinks CDC grossly underestimating many Americans infected. Let's step back observe calling edgy ripping people seemingly satisfied death reason say ""told so"". 

Yeah sorry, go kick rocks too. Viruses never really stop mutating, we‚Äôre probably going getting COVID shots like seasonal flu shots unless everyone gets board make big push stomp COVID continent. said executive order masks inhibit breathing children, he's protecting kids disabilities medical conditions might harmed wearing masks. extremely high efficacy trials led many hope would case, may well read much press, absolutely goal vaccine designers. government constantly urged people jump conclusion anyway. Im sorry sad kids zero sympathy people like this.  mean honestly should‚Äôve wearing masks flu season along might gotten mess. think needs become social norm you‚Äôre sick wear mask even get whole thing. go Disney yearly aren‚Äôt wrong. Fully vaxxed Pfizer April holding booster shot get studies regarding 3rd shot. put everyone else risk around literally makes us safer. pretty deep way looking it. crazy sounds, soon someone gets vaccine, shed mask. lucky , delta variants infecting vaccinated allowing vaccine vaccine spread, perverse effect. Mask mandate cannot go away anywhere indoors work home must continue foreseeable future. Today first run-in family vaccine. Everyone vaccinated except one sister family. invited go vacation them, asked going found family coming too, declined. hell broke loose. over-reacting? I‚Äôm heavy, blood clots issues 65. throwing everything thing convince go. Change sentence ‚Äúall Africa underdeveloped countries‚Äù. That‚Äôs good way looking it. Thanks perspective. concern proved true vaccine? Let's pretend future unknowable vaccines. started development SARS crisis, tested thoroughly things shelves drug store. 

If requires booster first line (being healthcare professional offers opportunity). need boosters virus stops mutating. tools combat this? none effective vaccines. Man sad see people thread asking ""I'm young healthy fully vaxxed want go outdoor gathering ten people we're wearing masks stay home?""

CDC known going backwards guidance would make people think vaccines work. message right way convoluted nuanced average person understands first glance. technology create centralized online database generated easily accessible QR codes mobile device could quickly efficiently authenticated. 

Oh right, do! hate government actually, know, work us. say forever. till variants pose crazy risks like now. forever anytime soon unfortunately either. Yup, exactly I'll homeschooling year. still another 8.4 years go decade. Plenty time hyperinflation become dominant theme it. Imagine right solve COVID entire 2nd half 2020s hyperinflation &amp; world permanently switching away USD world reserve currency right 2029 out. Hmm... live NJ got vaccinated NY early due ""essential"" worker NYC time. NJ clinics keep calling emailing constantly asking get vaccine... maybe take it. Dude, yes.

I‚Äôve commented many times past whole pandemic could literally count one hand amount people wearing mask went grocery shopping anywhere needed run errands too, vast majority did.

The typical Florida covid stories seem outside Orlando, especially south. friend lives Miami says difference night day. definitely relief see many people taking seriously here.

It definitely seems lot open though ever since CDC change recommendation. Yes. headed Delta. Another Delta inevitable. effective vaccine, there‚Äôs good reason couldn‚Äôt defeat covid. eventually hit evolutionary brick wall speak. happened party local / small government letting people decide do? always said this, continue so. Republican talking points ""personal freedom"" ""responsibility"" nothing easily digestible buzzwords get votes. care either things, happily comprise personal gain. Lmfao support literally welding people homes, you‚Äôre authoritarian level people like Mao Stalin would relate to. 

That shit insane. vaccinations Covid mutations, ‚ÄúSelective pressure- force drives organism evolve‚Äù‚Ä¶great, guess people also don‚Äôt believe evolution Okay giving deserve.

Is stupid, evil? I'm leaning toward evil.

He knows he's putting people risk he's weighing things out...by way, love ""big boy brain"" comment above, made lol, let's admit that's liberal fantasy. enough voters actually die make difference, keeps pandering, I'm guessing he'll win political arena. I'm guessing he's guessing too? Yeah... looks like factors parsed... overall discouraging probably right word.

Anyways, found figured would interested since good thoughts. Yeah course think larger point western world demanding boosters already 26% world received shot Great question. assume actually (university system), ya never know.  bummed got fully vaccinated two weeks ago happy take mask off... end. Two travellers arrived Toronto United States fined providing fake COVID-19 proof vaccination documents lying pre-departure Public Health Agency Canada says travellers also comply requirements stay government-authorized hotel get tested upon agency says news release Friday travellers arrived last week handed four fines totalling $19,720 each.

That‚Äôs $15,814 US dollars. really think 3 week lockdown would take? know viruses work? Correction: insurance racket causes Americans grief. It‚Äôs awful &amp; us jealous Universal Health Care üò≠ Thank sharing me. I'm upset happening family. someone's rights make choices harm butt rights harm loved ones?! ADA standard always minimalization harms (remember whole: can't wear mask need shop ADA said right equal access services shop safely you, curbside cost, etc.). take get bullied, protect family! weirdly awful position navigate. 

Syllabi reasonable accommodation standards (and versed this) offer safe version like recording streaming courses. seen many needing service appreciated it, schools pretending speak experiences wrong never even asked them, used points. 

As public funded employee, protections supports. find that, go University heads, way top friend, immediately. I've worked system, know bread buttered, expect employees to. issue isn‚Äôt even unvaccinated US.

It‚Äôs countries like India simply don‚Äôt enough vaccines mutations like Delta occurring. 

Even reached 90% vaccination rate Delta could still serious issue here. Delta whatever comes next. live Walmart town figured would Walmart store staff corporate jerks. Well aged like milk.  Shocking....not Even Delta, breakthrough infections mild asymptomatic. Ohio's lottery cost: 5,000,000

Number people vaccinated Ohio (at least one dose): ~5,430,000

Cost 2500 stimulus many people: 13,575,000,000 Wait airlines start mandating vaccinations negative COVID tests. People run get vaccine. Indeed Read somewhere 1 Pfizer 3 J&amp;J India large numbers vaccinated people. LOL certainly good story tell I‚Äôm sure exactly. easy lock real sense easily stop people going pretty much iron fist. I‚Äôm - 14 month old new baby coming September (hopefully Vax antibodies). thing freak look numbers severe infant infections mortality. regard adjusting virulent is, mortality rate kids 0-17 less flu. &lt;400 kids 0-17 died since 2019 covid US. 

It‚Äôs comforting, gives perspective - - wouldn‚Äôt lock kids flu season maybe covid either. 

Kids *generally* safe severe illness due covid. includes delta V need authorize existing vaccines children ASAP. 48 million people, even half getting vaccinated would push us past herd immunity higher vax states. goal stamp COVID completely

At least, immediately. big problem lot public health agencies temper people's expectations quick go all-or-nothing approach. idea people would take vaccines COVID would drop face Earth within months bizarre idea I'm sure caught on, although seems mostly American idea. due fact FDA approved. current political situation politicization vaccine trump political zeitgeist. Without FDA approval backlash would real possibly radical going actions far right radicalists last 2 years. really suck that's main reason mandated yet CDC wait scientists hash though. said pretty definitively ""if vaccinated need masks cuz protected"" even unproven.

Meanwhile, countries like Taiwan lot patient skeptical. incoming travelers still required quarantine even vaccinated individuals, noting publicly data proven vaccinated people could could spread virus. (we know delta vaccinated people often carry viral load). officials communicated caution people, still required everyone wear masks crowded public settings,regardless vaccination status. 2020s seem well way hyperinflation well looking like every 6 months instead yearly though...that's concern company broke ground new corporate office beginning last year. never happen us. It‚Äôs scheduled done spring 2022 I‚Äôm sure point back office full time. 

Last heard scheduled start going back one day week September slowly build back up. Salaried non-union... park workers?  immunocompromised folks SOL point? I'm gonna buy bubble suit. I'm California. I'm saying I'm seeing difference. family North Carolina things restricted perhaps half were. they're lower rate per capita date. Florida basically threw covid party ended rather meager difference. Texas quite Florida level, pretty loose, barely statistical difference.

I'm Sonoma County. case rate pretty bad climbing (14/1000 new case rate, 5.4% positive rate) we're really stuff before. Maybe, *maybe* we'll end mask mandate again. I'm speculating they've realized public shutdowns particularly effective.

I'm saying shutdowns total waste, return worth cost. problem looking ER numbers shocking number people - primarily low income people - use ER visits standard care. Kid gets sick - go ER see doctor. coworkers take kids ER 10-12 times per year No, I'm not. I'm saying CDC identified 346 breakthrough positive cases 123 unvaccinated cases. 

If 3500 vaccinated people exposed 350 unvaccinated people (given demographics attended), even remarkable result. denominator matters, data exposures, we're looking outbreak one angle.

It's tricky part interpreting studies like this. realize herd immunity doesn‚Äôt mean everyone get virus? seems like you‚Äôre really understanding term. Herd immunity means virus can‚Äôt spread enough potential hosts around sort immunity fight quickly. can‚Äôt exist air long, virus die without infecting anyone else can‚Äôt jump another host. immunity achieved prior infection vaccination. nation herd immunity polio, example, everyone infected, it‚Äôs almost everyone polio vaccine. Thank you...me too! Stay safe wherever are, Texas. Delta variant currently putting kids respirators filling children's hospitals. dont give shit cuz political agenda push. primary concern people's long-term correlated health issues never acknowledged. assessed well enough, especially multiple boosters, never really implemented before. deeper assessments multiple boosters may impact body needed, they're properly undertaken. Yeah, refuse believe he's actually stupid. What's really scary must know he's putting lots children terrible risk...and what? MEAN LITERALLY WHAT

You hear people say things like ""I wonder sleeps night"" seriously...I wonder. Okay you‚Äôre suggesting original poster goes gets third shot aren‚Äôt even allowed get? degree privilege sub shows astounding. CDC authorized vaccines 12 yet? waiting safety trials still?

If even half 48 million fully vaccinated, would push fully vaccinated 210 million, 63% fully vaccinated nationally. it‚Äôs man. going target feel better isn‚Äôt anything lol Yes hospitalization data always lot accurate anyway since cases always underreported since many people asymptomatic and/or get tested salaried employees (mostly white colored) non union employees. Union negotiations underway know vaccinated people spread amongst themselves? likely became infected source (i.e. unvaccinated). myColorado app well. saw idea today immunized commingling unvaccinated causes *selection pressure* favor breakthrough mutations. Essentially, mutations occur virus access immunized, must escape immunity order fit enough propagate. effect training virus wearing masks. would Disney give shit politicians want. buy politicians favors give shit feelings. 

Disney wants.  Good thing people like won‚Äôt let biology trump politics /s .professionals virology/epidemiology field raised issue trail data peer reviewed supposed norm vaccine. data made available????

So 70+ percent 2x vaxx people getting covid showing infection count, getting symptoms, question well vaxx working?  Oh say, surely would died vaxx.... know fact? 

I'm selling tiger rocks one interested.... people claim they're waiting FDA approval going get anyway. either lie getting move goal posts. Oh gosh‚Ä¶.I‚Äôm sorry. wish would least mandate masks elementary schools. babies protection vaccinated teachers still get it. hope babies stay safe üíó So... GOP. like always got thinking... got first dose end March got cold mid-April. got COVID test negative. likely delta variant know time? got thinking... got first dose end March got cold mid-April. got COVID test negative. likely delta variant know time? got thinking... got first dose end March got cold mid-April. got COVID test negative. likely delta variant know time? get taken last night? deemed ""low value content"" whatever thought info. fascinating. part USDA report last night. Hope stays now. Hospitals vary course,. UCHealth (in Colorado got mine).. Hospital App includes Covid/Vaccination info (including QR codes). liked part vaccination data children available time testing commenced monkeys. Maybe time take meds again. soon announced, school dropped mask mandates children. ZERO sense. understand it.  got Moderna vaccine. second shot got 7AM. fine around 6pm. started getting chills. 8pm felt like truck hit me. Chills got really bad night. late morning mend fine noon. first started dating current partner, lax flu vaccine. got flu. gotten mine. ended caring him- pop place snacks fluids meds. brought masks. wear one room (picking trash, refilling humidifier such).

I catch flu. :) Duh! Aka... Assholes Identity politics.  actually believe that's achievable goal though? Downplayers furiously trying figure spin big deal. Provincetown cluster mostly residents Provincetown. 150 live particular town. rest live outside Provincetown. 

The county state 70% vaccination rates. guess problem remembering 1918 one WW1, Great Depression &amp; WW2 long afterwards. History class focused Prohibition &amp; Weimar hyperinflation 1920s themes. Vaccinated population also skews older vaccination rates older populations currently much higher younger populations Haha beat POG I'm sorry hate statistics. Asians Asian, Hispanics Hispanics. People bad situations look better ones. There's less white people illegally simply statistically desperate positions leading risk lives get often.

Perhaps worry less keyboard warrior issues drive people come illegally want help people. vaccine prevented hospitalizations, number hospitalized would lower percentage people vaccinated Massachusetts. think fault data lumping vaccines together J&amp;J may less effective delta. It‚Äôs still really concerning either way clear (because mangled edit) meant testing unvaxxed kiddo.

Mainly I'd feel bit better going back person school antibodies. No, almost vaccines, especially coronaviridae vaccines, average ten-year development testing schedule. one went Phase 3 five months. Add fact mRNA, even less testing.

They tested ""more thoroughly"". That's false. true testing longitudinal studies, means time.

Go want. act incorrect information, disseminate misunderstanding basic concepts around you, especially healthcare professional.
 
If understand rigorous testing based repeated re-assessments reactions longitudinal studies, think clear understanding vaccine development basic virology. people trust healthcare pro, responsibility give incorrect indicators. say recently.. line needs talk manager.  womb. wants dead mothers. Utah. 3 6 years old...and I'm pregnant. I'm teacher.

They're killing us  someone say ‚Äúsalt‚Äù?

Aiteeeeeeeee! Good. national requirement.  'higher ups' expose well? yes, tribal politics you. Unions included too. likely negotiate first. I'm guessing union employees given option tested every week mask indefinitely choose vaccinated.  Can't get Pfizer Moderna ones too?

You'd protected far know (2 Pfizer) Jab, Benny! Jab, Benny! really one second many, many, many people would already sick. example, simple cloth masks many people wearing 50% filtration, therefore sick healthy person wear them, exposure would take 4 seconds. would mean? Every single restaurant, every single airline flight, every elevator full people, every office, would already sick. That's quite happening yet, level. think like take CDC's original 10-15 min typical time get sick, probably 3-6 min contact get sick (just guess, actual data back up). right thing. Everyone got vaccine right thing. going make safer covid.

Don't feel guilty getting normal life back. biggest ""carrot"" attempted federally mandated PTO vaccine appointments vaccine related side effects. True, seems like stop vaccine center questions asked. 

Obviously trying selfish take away someone reality aren‚Äôt used Jail next? Weird thought conservatives believed small government ü§î got ride virus's. not? FDA seems focusing least mainly Pfizer right now. looked DeSantis' vaccine passport executive order, says businesses can't require proof vaccination patrons customers, word employees. think lot us you‚Ä¶the problem doctor tell get right No. forced sorts things. forced refrain sorts things. can't anything body hurt someone else (like assault). ingest sorts things (floride, etc) due government regulations.  

Again, like 14 year old read Atlas Shrugged experienced world. really get points making really bad pizza like decade realizing killing off? Extroversion self-centeredness powerfully associated personality statistics. happened personally prove disprove anything. Lots people never develop symptoms all, regardless vaccination. ‚Äúprove‚Äù covid isn‚Äôt serious? even bothering replying you, people believe whatever want believe.  can't mandate people want wear masks so.

8% better Texas, 2% worse North Carolina, **significantly** mandates regulatory intervention.

Fool's errand, incompetent leadership habe realized mistakes much sooner. Seems like finally have. Better late never guess. wonder date desantis back track? going nightmare.

Yikes. people get vaccinated, expect higher percentage hospitalizations vaccinated. doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs working.

Our goal 100% hospitalized people vaccinated, since would happen 100% population vaccinated. goal virus spread all? that's unrealistic

You know that's wrote. Stop moving goalposts suit argument.  It‚Äôs incredibly frustrating / stressful / scary situation around. still can‚Äôt get masks even political issue all, it‚Äôs absurd. Masks required school buses fall CDC mandate transportation CDC needs expand mandate schools, least schools serve children 12. it‚Äôs political fight worth picking, IMO.

Just move states community heavily vaccinated thinking getting extra protection vaccines aren‚Äôt used find really depressing people don‚Äôt seem care us need frequent healthcare services.

Be honest, much people care COVID? know, many Americans fighting better healthcare system? health repercussions getting third Pfizer dose? 

Just move states community heavily vaccinated thinking getting extra protection vaccines aren‚Äôt used  take studies grain salt. wanted point places reporting different efficacy reported US. Even UK reported 72% least one study. also tested positive, symptomatic % still something like 88% effective. I'm guessing true number much higher 40% reported Israel, 80%-88% see reported US. Either way still stop severe illness hospitalization high rate(90%+) part important IMO. 72% though I'm still masking up. Especially since live state still 40% fully vaccinated. hell saying 0 cases? Straw man, much? they... really need conduct survey know that? ü§î agree. teachers strike...

people quick tell though, illegal texas teachers strike, lose teaching certificates...which always sounds contrary me.. point strike use power numbers threat actual execution working fight benefits, easily suppressed saying ""if dont work wont let work""... heck state remove certifications majority teachers? answer fail. part terms strike include future protections right organize strike among covid demands have. info, gov require get vaccine pay fine. established case law. 

An employer can't fine you, I'm aware anyway... replace antivaxxer someone that's got common sense.  show illegal pretty sure means nothing.  government also makes stop stop signs driving, lessen chance hurt others. 

Again, thought saying most-shallow ""muh freedoms"" level. know herd immunity is, don‚Äôt need manslpaned. 

Polio wasn‚Äôt covid stretch. 

The truth covid don‚Äôt nearly enough vaccinated achieve you‚Äôre suggesting above. achieve herd immunity, would require removing masks eliminating social distancing point. lot people would get sick lot people would require medical treatment lot would die. 

It isn‚Äôt realistic. Bow mouse. runs shiz. sort ADA exception son? Seems like virtual would reasonable accommodation given circumstances. I‚Äôm going live fear longer.

I wish could like Israel UK require vaccine passports large events things like Lollapalooza call day.   vaccines 90% effective preventing Delta infection. That‚Äôs still 10% chance getting infected, albeit greatly reduced risk hospitalization death. I‚Äôm saying people vaccinated, less hosts virus able spread thus less spread. current wave US largely driven unvaccinated. look NYT hotspot map. hotspots areas low vaccination rates. ‚Äúoutbreaks‚Äù like one northeast tiny comparison, probably initiated unvaccinated out-of-towners came 4th July.

Sure, viral load vaccinated unvaccinated infected. unvaccinated *10 times* susceptible contracting delta, causing much spread. don‚Äôt understand people can‚Äôt grasp this.  KNOW HEARD TODAY DELTA SPREADING? 
HERE GO.
PEOPLE GOT VACCINATED ,THE VACCINE MUTATING INSIDE BODY, EVER COUGH SNEEZE TALK, SPREADING NEW DELTA VIRUS. MANY PEOPLE GETTING IT. 

I SWEAR CANT MAKE UP. CAME PERSON BUDDY , COOL DUDE. WANT VACCINATIONS. Stop ""both sides"" bullshit. making hypothetical scenario basis reality - why? going mad, mad things actually happening, stop contributing problem political polarization. Try contact lenses? know would worse? wait safety data lots ofnkids die vaccines
 Nobody would ever trust vaccines again. 

It needs done scientifically, even takes while. Good bot f u c k. u Dominant men less likely share wives. it‚Äôs another thing think matters, many people refuse existing vaccine. wait lambduh males enter mix structure whole society way life around protecting absurdly small fraction people would benefit vaccine? really need figure way expedite approval process new vaccines. current covid vaccine designed week took year get approved. That's long lead time stay ahead virus' evolution (anecdotally) confirm. Fully vaccinated, still wear mask stores expect indoor crowd. Interesting. long virus last sewage? many cases kids willing trade more-thorough process? definite cost disease *will* pay, reduce cost *may* pay vaccine. never well. busting it.  think misspelling Biden Definitely. also there's lots English media Taiwan, Japan, Korea. follow closely kept grounded last year - especially American media peers made feel crazy.

I follow YouTube channel, English. lot fluff pieces, covid related videos eye opening. instance video I'm linking one covid precautions university exams: announce cases Taiwan, keep person anonymous explain circumstances got virus also CT value PCR test, found interesting. (it apparently supposed roughly tell viral load, though always accurate indicative severity infection) humpback...but worries, whale spat wants plankton people. Diver happened area whale found plankton wanted eat. yeah, humpbacks huge. flu strains likely went extinct due measures took COVID. extroverted kinda self centered man feel personally called done Covid restrictions since vaxxed important.

We spend lot time talking fake/misleading news effect people, never talk news sources deceive readers/viewers *omitting* certain types stories.

imo actually far bigger problem, tends subtle even respected news sources it. mean, never really tried carrots. meaningful way least.

I would ideally like see us go balls wall carrots sticks.

Lastly, NYC, you‚Äôd know congested Subway gets 4~ pm every weekday. It‚Äôs packed point people sitting next other, enclosed AC cars. take route everyday opinion it‚Äôs much worse Disney‚Äôs condition

Essentially, outbreaks happen, vaccines control outbreaks also protecting vaccinated individuals due contract virus. transition period virus becoming endemic highly vaccinated areas. Cases eventually become white noise, we‚Äôre used vaccines dismantling rate, strong rise cases scary, vaccines provide strong barrier protection community level. *Surprised Pikachu face* least killing mostly voters. CDC idiotic. public doesn‚Äôt get nuance. I‚Äôve heard described choose adventure response pandemic instead firm guidelines.

The CDC knows fact way bring spread recommend masks worn everywhere. needs say so. anti vaxxers typically disclaim vaccinations smallpox polio, selective based deem hurt vaccinated what's problem? already one dose, country‚Äôs standards get second one 2 months. Im asking get 2 doses one. Isn‚Äôt 60 days much gap doses pfizer? Yep, friend Nova Scotia whose parents adamantly anti vaccine, anti mask despite things helping much, despite locally great numbers...

It seem crazy that, hard hit states, could really drive fraction antibodies next month. bad hard, deadly way.

For example, MO, 50% total population vaccinated. estimated ~33% US population already covid. Assuming uncorrelated vaccination, gets us 67% population antibodies. Everyone getting sick right driving number further. Plus, vaccinations ticked week (3M got first shot past 7 days--the highest number long time). also add. Well, bit tbh.

Im sorry personally think stupid thing make tests cost something.

As one said, ppl refuse pay tests places tests needed spread there. dunno. UK practically double vaccination rates areas, there's less population Delta rip through. Two points:

1) end, actually exceedingly little evidence Texas' restrictions anything (with suggestive evidence low compliance). Basically, [TX's reopening associated increased COVID flip side -- saying needed restore employment -- there's evidence reopening either.

2) unfair comparison natural immunity. NY's first wave, higher amounts natural immunity there, many vulnerable killed. pick random point time *after* first NY wave measure from, course TX higher cases/deaths! simply fewer people natural protection.

I'm claiming this. I'm saying infection transmission among fully vaxxed thing problem. Less severe problem infection transmission among non vaxxed? Maybe, still major problem.

Anyway, I'm seeing there's different symptoms vaccinated infected Delta variant. week ago, got rather sizeable rainstorm, noticed slightly funny feeling back throat, felt like post nasal drip. bit sinus headache too. 

Sudafed helped. 

At first, chalked rapid shift weather. now, knowing difference symptoms, I'm sure. study appears vaccinated making disproportionate percentage hospitalizations.

1 non vaccinated hospitalization
0.81% non-vaccinated hospitalization rate Maybe people actually supposed military intervention necessary know conservatives stupid ‚Äúglobal warming? Buts it‚Äôs 40 degrees outside!‚Äù thing? comment equal opposite. 

A quick little jab based simple comment sounds like it‚Äôs principally correct. Firstly literally can‚Äôt get 100% you‚Äôre right I‚Äôve mentioned there‚Äôs people actually can‚Äôt take vaccine due medical conditions allergies. survival rates way off, delta much deadlier 3-4% fatality rate even higher, people worried long Covid since don‚Äôt know much effects long term vaccines reduce risk, like we‚Äôre going move besides probable annual flu shot type thing combat future variants I‚Äôve said pandemics end eventually move on. Also example gave hesitancy, people likely get around trust means government needs convey best vaccines 39% effective according Israeli study. Chinese vaccines virtually useless variant. Pfizer vaccine applied approval China China approved begun mass production.  vaccines work lol. Even seem believe they're useless. Stop pedantic. ‚ÄúAny time something happens‚Äù? something happens every year 100 year pandemic. never vaccine second thrid year pandemic. look UK numbers, deaths January peak around 16 days cases peak. 59,417 cases peak translated 1,244 deaths 16 days later (peak). look todays 7 day rolling average deaths 72, count back 16 days cases 34,571.

Ah, clear - I'm definitely disputing efficacy vaccines now. previous comment removed, stated amongst vaccinated population, deaths hospitalizations exceedingly rare (I think like 1 death 3 hospitalizations per 100,000 amongst vaccinated individuals) given vaccines 100% effective, pleased that. manage get majority US (and world matter, pretty clear highly transmissible variants always end globetrotters), gradual downhill slide things.

My original comment implying since Delta highly transmissible, seems would also dramatically increase likelihood variant emerging escapes vaccine efficacy significantly altogether. Delta indication, seems like we're going wrong direction. vaccines rendered ineffective see variant transmissible severe, things would undoubtedly much worse before. solution scary (but plausible) *""what-ifs""* unvaccinated quickly get vaccinated large numbers.  censored downvoted sure fear reality. You‚Äôve done others responded similarly.

To three people read reflexively want downvote this, I'm pro mask vaccinated blah blah blah, facts facts. Follow science. scared shitless global pandemic totally reasonable, excuse ignore quantifiable data might help allay fears. god redditors going soak headline like  Gamma (and Lambda) decline South America.

I'm protecting 1) breakthrough infection 2) unvaccinated children say Political comment right here.... Guess username checks People gonna people Funny world run mostly worst people. news. News things ordinary, sort fine normalized egregious acts. guess [NY article quoting CDC report would do.

But I'm sure claim breakthrough infections rare. ongoing surge shows otherwise. Perhaps applies US places much vaccination also restrictions place. think brings bad PR product general COVAXIN expensive vaccine (~$40 2 shots) without EUL's peer reviews manufacturing nowhere good. already see people talking ""can trust COVAXIN?"" govt enough Job show ""This vaccine works par better others. deadly original according study, remains good research this.  Alpha+Beta+Gamma somewhere (but distinguish UK data (just looking page 19), vaccines prevent chance infection something like 9x chance death infected something like 3.5x. first direct effect CFR (though vaccinating elderly therefore lower CFR, vaccinating young raise it), second enough counter increase Delta.  cdc study showed vaccinated people transmit much non vaccinated.

Every first-generation VOI appeared fully-formed original strain (B.1 closely related lineage) probable ancestor. assumed evolved single long-term host, presumably immunocompromised person could fight virus continually mutated spread faster within body evade immune response. many mutations, work together make VOI behave efficiently.

We know vaccinated people much less genetic diversity (of COVID), therefore single-host mutation process less likely happen vaccination. lot world's immunocompromised people vaccinated recovered COVID now, perhaps second generation VOI's created way. is, know would look like.

A mutations pop repeatedly effective, E484K certain deletions. none ever behaved differently original strain. We've also seen (or speculated on) genetic exchange VOI's, Delta acquiring K417N (which ever seen Beta knowledge) sharing Bangladesh Beta. none measurably fit parent VOI.

If whole picture, selective pressure simply exist - rather, created immune system host VOI mutates within, society-wide vaccination. VOI spread host, evolution essentially done either spreads doesn't.

In particular, vaccinated unvaccinated mingling homogeneously optimally reduce spread reduce number new cases, therefore mutations, see. course, there's reason vaccinated people would want hang unvaccinated, practice really matter.

The idea vaccines cause new mutation happen hold water. idea vaccines cause new mutation spread holds water insomuch getting vaccinated lets us drop NPIs. weird one hand knew (the Yankees situation , e.g.) hand momentum behind thinking unvaccinated people pose extreme hazard infectivity, universities banning in-person classes them, federal agencies corporations demanding everone vaccinated etc. seems disconnect facts hand policies. vaccine passports large events things like Lollapalooza call day.

No need answer that, example ""nanny state""
If think curing preventable problems, tax payers money, irresponsible agree idea nanny state.  Since beginning CDC/broader public health authority trying tailor messaging nudge behavior. understandable, it‚Äôs hurt credibility many ways. Early masks deep cleaning/sanitization. told people buy masks keep HC workers overnight said everyone needs mask up. lead mask wars. slow admit deep cleaning pointless, lead bunch unsafe behaviors i.e. people thinking indoor dining safe wiped table extra. vaccines came along initially told newly vaccinated people new things could things people already doing. implemented ‚Äúhonor system‚Äù around masking thinking would encourage people get vaccinated. Knowing anti-vax/mask crowd 0 honor comes this. back say everyone mask again. they‚Äôre trying show vaccines work Delta really bad vaccines may effective preventing Delta infection. yet message half country hears ‚Äúvaccines don‚Äôt work, CDC full shit‚Äù. 

I understand science messy doesn‚Äôt always lend clean linear narrative. ‚Äúflip flops‚Äù reacting new data. However, theyre trying epidemiological body behavioral psych body they‚Äôve failing latter. Add sensationalist media thrives clicks you‚Äôve got recipe problems. 

I don‚Äôt solutions minimum need stop coddling anti-vaxers. empathy, ‚Äútrying understand meet people level‚Äù, ‚Äúeducating people science easing concerns‚Äù. time past. People haven‚Äôt vaccinated people would doubt sky blue CDC/government told them. aren‚Äôt going reach carefully crafted focus group messaging drive hole. need make strict guidelines mandates. need make abundantly clear thing stay difference flu like virus disability/death vaccination. need lay framework insurance companies charge unvaccinated kinds punitive measures.

Tl;dr CDC trying play epidemiologist behavioral psychologist, they‚Äôve sucking latter. need Read room recognize anti-Vaxers don‚Äôt give shit respond forceful measures targeted directly them. articles calling ""Bear Week"" Provincetown, month?

I guess ignore group people one wants criticize. massive number breakthrough cases it, report event ""activities"" happening would ideal transmission virus.

Instead pretend reasonable representation rest country use make fully vaccinated people wear masks That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ really bad idea. means unvaccinated people *also* refuse get tested. local wedding, travel (ie. my/our hometown, I'm visiting thought would last month WFH). Unless convince dangerous go, they're gonna go. want that, seeming like responsible thing do. would also mean go, got fucked closest friends. get saying though. people working Olympics tested frequently lots restrictions them. 2 Georgian athletes left Olympic village sightsee sent home (their events anyway leave, still). already feel like I'm going dessicate like end Saving Private Ryan turn 30. made plans 2022, international plans 2023. involve masks. absolutely 100% crossing border illegally.   offices mandatory vaccination lose staff/have trouble filling empty positions : people want feel safe work. feel safe surrounded 'pigpens' Hell saw people posting they'd answer door gun government showed vaccinate them. governors ones rails. Funny thing healthcare history private. go get jab tell absolutely one nobody except medical professionals would find out. 

They want vaxxed morons, social pressure. Alpha Chads unite! Lol  WTF CDC: 
""COVID-19 vaccines safe effective.


Millions people United States received COVID-19 vaccines intense safety monitoring U.S. Redditor I'm talking to: ""side effects vaccines dangerous prevalent disease. controversial. vaccines experimental. provide proof statement.""

Me: ""Ok, bye."" Everyone ignoring airborne, dealing reality would cost much money. still getting useless hygiene theater like ""deep cleaning"" surfaces, surface transmission well known non-issue point. I‚Äôm right now. think $10/hr third-party security looking give anything ‚Äúdoes say negative‚Äù, you‚Äôd wrong. 

It‚Äôs literally 2 second look it. name verification/ID check make sure it‚Äôs person. time check 72hrs. 

Overall. It‚Äôs gonna disaster. Bars jammed area around festival day. 1 10 masked. Basically best vaccine world , Pfizer, good enough return normal. offices, parties, gyms, etc.

The problem end rope. nothing else. rest world even worse AZ sinovac. I‚Äôm going, one time get free ticket place stay music festival it‚Äôs damn pandemic. Lol Well US, proportion breakthrough cases unvaccinated cases happens 1 / 88% think we're still good far. Mostly cuz it‚Äôs fully FDA approved yet. is,  Yes, people still die Covid getting vaccinated. According CDC, 161 million people considered ‚Äúfully vaccinated‚Äù 6000 hospitalized 900 died due Covid.

So, that‚Äôs 0.0037% vaccinated people hospitalized due Covid 0.00056% vaccinated people dying it. odds dying vehicle wreck 2019 1/8900 0.01%, vaccinated person likely die commuting work Covid. I‚Äôd say vaccines pretty damn good.

There always people refuse vaccine matter much convince them. accept fact people get die. like accept everyday people die car Grand Central Station them. literally walk right in, lines, waiting. think mean severe illness they‚Äôre talking hospitalization. 

But people gotten long Covid who‚Äôve symptoms didn‚Äôt require hospitalization. vaxxed people risk. may hospitalized get miserably sick land long Covid territory. feel unnecessary people listen either way? Massachusetts 60% fully vaxxed 70% first shot, since going end June.


That's big difference home state 40% fully vaccinated 45% one shot today.


The higher percentage people vaccinated, risk people protected.


If percentage vaccinated high enough cover one guy. probably would three vaxxed people hospitalized.


But three vaccinated outcome could much worse. worldometer reported 99,470 cases yesterday. Different websites reporting wildly different numbers due states changing report numbers. two weeks better protection mRNA vaccines get many vaccines used around world. Florda men Florida men. combination entitlement ignorance people living Florida points extreme issues education. terrifying / sad enough electorate FL, TX etc masks, vaccines, etc elected official go it... think general pattern similar, proportions &amp; timing different.

It take longer work UK &amp; Netherlands; individual states metro areas closely resemble UK Netherlands, peak time composite spike broader result.  think there's point where, cold enough, matter. I've gotten pointers thread here. phase 3 Pfizer clinical trials now. think key point is, Covid, surprisingly large proportion people *reduction* able UK Canada switched longer gap doses soon results better protection came though.

Israel stuck 3 weeks studies pointing possible waning, although selection bias results bad raw data would seem imply.  [At least 125,000 fully vaccinated Americans tested positive Covid 1,400 pedantic part? ü§£ waiting someone make connection!! countries peaked already, even asia wheres theres vaccine. fucking politicians overreacting acting like ‚Äúheroes‚Äù. also hate losers, anti vaxxx pro mask/lockdown baboons. what‚Äôs true lol reversal advice weeks ago, applies certain places meet certain technical criteria, likely change time.

Policies affect hundreds millions people, obsessively paying attention, others oblivious uncaring, cannot turn dime, think.

I work large company huge HR department conscientiously trying follow guidance. changed policy weeks back say vaccinated people inside buildings need masked. trying get 30,000 people board this. Yesterday, sent new policy countermanding that. Needless say, pretty chaotic even relatively controlled well-intentioned environment. Comply restrictions? staying home staying home cool. gentrified home. Vast majority politicians care health, care make sure infrastructure collapse people continue voting them.

So right vaccine freely available reason going back masks ensure healthcare collapse, covid patients ICU die.

The reason also hesitant require vaccination attend social activities sure voters support that. know Covid could make people fat

Maybe already fat? really don‚Äôt understand difference? Sports disabilities don‚Äôt spread grow exponentially, infecting millions people. Viruses do. One study nurses showed vaccine reduce rates long covid compared unvaxxed. 

... grand total sample size 7, yes. heard NPR today vaccinated person breakthrough case delta much virus nose unvaccinated person original covid. thresholds set beginning pandemic. need adjusted reflect huge reduction risk brought vaccines.  forget flair. ‚Ä¶. people lung damage. Didn‚Äôt know Covid could make people fat ones true ? lol CDC pretty slow things. took petition large group scientists finally change view aerosol main way virus spreading. four weeks ago stopped tasting coffee. Nothing else. stayed home week. could tested, see point. Love vaccine though.  Also flights open Florida Latin America. havw people know able get vaccinated yet traveling Florida since midway pandemic Mexico I'm seeing even people now. Miami receives people latam need negative test days flight nearly sufficient especially communities control spread, like Mexico city. hold magnet arm. 

Checkmate science. statement bullshit, meaningless best misleading worst. mean, probably factually correct, tell anything value.

It's similar ""XY% hospitalized people unvaccinated"" nonsense, include lot timeframe basically 0% people vaccinated. get dressed, tired time, can‚Äôt wait stairs‚Ä¶

Obese people? glasses end adjusting bit? Mine would fog first 5-10 min going somewhere good. Florida 20k day since Jan 1 (though it'll probably happen week) soon expected FDA approval? that's true virus contracted new Orleans. equally plausible (even plausible?) contracted home state, traveled symptoms took hold took spiral visiting. like spirit idea, think would probably lead shit ton domestic terror attacks. 18 I'm 20. Half college drain. Welp. Username checks out, guess. (I literally laughed loud saw it.) looked like pandemic pretty much behind us delta hit target got moved.

Sorry bought ‚Äúone done‚Äù advertising. Definitely marketing fail government hoping get everyone vaccinated they‚Äôre walk back.

If truly want ‚Äúdo part,‚Äù I‚Äôm sure do‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll follow science. recommends everyone masking high transmission areas (most US) world behind cause US horded vaccines even want public domain recently. Delta came countries control spread, saying there's nothing encourages spread thus allowing mutations. need vaccines, shut downs mask regulations need used we're seeing vaccinated also spreading virus, thus causing potential mutations. long cause new deadlier strain keep shit individualistic mentality have.  Masking exponentially protective everyone wears one  *desantis enters chat.* 55 new cases? anything delta spreads quickly true numbers 10-20x reported. tax payer want pay disability benefits next 50 years.

You tax payer also pay social security disability benefits people engage high risk sports get injured people smoke/abuse alcohol get ill drugs. got charged $200 shipping handling supplier indicated. Feels like fucking scam, work them? still haven‚Äôt given reason exclusionary language. talking pregnancy, need know someone uterus baby it. identify irrelevant. headline uses correct degree specificity situation.  worries! even noticed original mistake pointed Right held onto past March, per comment replied to.  know never going end right? Soon another variant another on. isn‚Äôt true. increasing number studies finding greater one quarter patients developed form long COVID. One study China found three quarters patients least one ongoing symptom six months discharge, another report, half infected healthcare workers reported ongoing symptoms seven eight months infection. See article   orgies grocery store daily. Netflix documentary coming soon. we‚Äôll compromised already dead NY first wave 

can‚Äôt rising death count already dead sincere question here. meant challenge anything.

Do reasons expect US go differently gone Netherlands UK respect Delta peaking quickly? I‚Äôm really thinking next strain point, Delta strain 4th big time strain we‚Äôve seen states? keep getting worse.  India produced Delta, logic UK produced Alpha.
Both correct there's way knowing actually produce variants. first detected regions, conclusive enough evidence state that's originated. 
I agree COVID needs controlled here, there's genuine chance variant popping India, calling Delta product India may fully correct. That's news reports include ""Delta, first detected India"" rather ""Delta, originating India"". feels like smearing. China perfect country, well covid situation. hunan changsha. got one case made classes students closed today. summer holidays schools open. many students still got classes, like boxing, dancing, language etc. shutdown government right now. adult, even student, still can't go dance classes now. one case. serious take things. still get vaccine. It'll free.

Getting poked arm free friendly people calm orderly fashion go through. They'll give sticker, card basically says way kicking covid nuts.

The alternative rushed hospital professionals collectively see hundreds thousands people die many permanently debilitated/injured. Think that. want see damn face.

Go get shots fucking proud yourself. Accurate. anxious? Vaccine doesn‚Äôt protect one bit delta variant, you‚Äôre likely die unvaccinated even likely transmit it/s. Well article says

About 57% eligible New Yorkers fully vaccinated, vaccination rates lowest rural counties well Bronx Brooklyn.

I assume ‚Äúeligible‚Äù means ‚Äúnot kids‚Äù genuinely read link better info. Also one shot isn‚Äôt gonna cut it. Using language communicate order specific vague. Steadily taking away language expanding include fallacies creates society based lies. 

There could ‚Äúmany‚Äù intersex trans individuals, relation rest world population. It‚Äôs actually small number, especially consider autism sometimes related transgender, mistaken identity people thinking trans, actually not. articles google relationship autism transgender. 
Also, de-transitioning mistake thinking trans real. numbers decline factor components. 

The reason ‚Äútying together pregnancy womanhood‚Äù pregnancy title article, discussion bc wording. 
Obviously, going agree, reading write strengthens points regardless unpopular current climate live in. c bajs üî≠ Effective mean fucking immune.

Get box n95s wear them. nitpicking? asked question. Sometimes difference PCR rapid antigen tests different regards cycle thresholds. Point being, might enough infectious viral RNA rapid test pick up. perhaps past infectious stage...  Masks *do* help catch though, they‚Äôre better preventing spreading it. Still, offer non-negligible amount protection contracting virus. problem places like Disney World setting requirement. they‚Äôre going allow thousands people park, think bear responsibility make sure isn‚Äôt virus outbreak (I think still responsibility even aren‚Äôt requiring vaccination).

So legitimately asking could verify customers vaccinated, excuse say shouldn‚Äôt bother. .85% think, google math done right, yeah?  Washington Post death toll week CDC research cited article suggests Covid19 could behave like chicken pox. congrats, live computers destroyed universe ends. Still 100 percent mortality rate. self check registers need vaxed though?  condescending ass? Among five Covid patients hospitalized, four fully vaccinated, according agency. deaths reported.  people? get flu vaccines? deal here! Husband got sick flu-like symptoms tested positive week ago. didn‚Äôt really isolate tried keep distance talk days worst symptoms. continued test negative gotten sick, amazingly. 10 days symptom onset, husband back normal despite sense smell diminished still :( Vaccines work, people!!! Eh, think picking people congregation calling individually spending time dwelling details them. read closely, direct mention congregation article briefly noting clapped cheered anti-mask remarks.

I think much different news year ago certain ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities New York refusing cancel in-person religious services (or weddings, yeshiva schools) high case rates COVID resulted neighborhoods. took intro stats class, know I‚Äôm talking about. Even worse; vaccinated people ended hospitalized potentially younger age group (20-70). compare chance developing serious side effects catching Covid? ""long term effects"" post covid typically would expect pre vaccination serious bout. Contrary misinformation media sub puts alarming frequency cant get small fever recover experience flare 6 months later. wont happen-dont worry.

The whole function vaccines turn disease mild illness prevent long term effects unfortunately worst vaccine stock. 

Incorrect. Sad lot people included saying ‚Äúf unvaccinated let die.‚Äù see article picture it‚Äôs actually really sad. Death death, gone forever. family grieving something avoidable. Please anyone reading get vaccinated don‚Äôt throw family away cult political affiliation. Sorry, sarcastically quoting side first statement. You‚Äôre brain dead blind realize, though. mother day 4 breakthrough case (double Pfizer jabbed, 2nd jab months ago).

She still high fever, shivers, chills, headaches smell. 

Logic tells she‚Äôll fine, she‚Äôs double jabbed. 

My anxiety tells diabetes getting really bad symptoms - worry worry worry. Unles unable get due age actual medical reasons I‚Äôm struggling feel anything point. 


And hate wife died Covid....that makes guy's decision making much worse. You‚Äôre fully vaccinated‚Ä¶roommate‚Äôs unvaccinated‚Ä¶ contract COVID‚Ä¶ gives 30 days vacate? valid reason she‚Äôs provided? Sounds unreasonable me. missing something?  People trash people getting vaxed still feel bad happens.

Thar said think gov go door door gun point vax people. CDC 100% knows. stupid. issue really news organizations missed point here. Ptown point. point internal modeling CDC based studies Delta's R0 vaccine's effectiveness preventing infection. See slides 20-21 CDC presentation reporting based on. slides show effectively curb spread delta interventions besides vaccines need reach 90%+ vaccination coverage much higher levels natural immunity. CDC can't push harder already vaccines next best option add additional intervention, case masks.

Ptown simply demonstration model effect. Even high vaccine coverage outbreaks Delta due high R0. Especially situations many exposures short period time like Ptown 4th. vaccines likely worked well anywhere Shush supposed talk that. sample take sample mean, estimate population mean. estimate gets better higher sample number, also depends true difference population means, well sample variance

Try Wikipedia, students t-test Spanish flu worse year two year one. Granted vaccine. statistics folks really brain dead blind. keep saying point we'll let virus circulate naturally among population like cold viruses now. can't mask take precautions forever. Oh makes feel good predictable outcomes. Keep stories coming. can‚Äôt wait ‚ÄúI‚Äôm double vaxxed, I‚Äôve done part I‚Äôm wearing mask‚Äù remorse stories start they‚Äôve transmitted covid unvaccinated child refused wear mask indoor public spaces despite abundance information since June actively fought mask mandates. Keep up! human race absolute garbage proving everyday! time think children busy owning l!bs. Yes was. it‚Äôs even worse now. Thanks don‚Äôt go. wording around poor far seen couple different reports saying something like that. think it‚Äôs worded wrong. think vaccinated carrying enough virus spread others. DeSantis's Plan Working...

He's taking money Big Covid. Actually quite people expect vaccine perfect defense. 7% high, need booster. First cases goes up. around 2 weeks hospitalizations starts rise finally 2 weeks see deaths goes up. So, need wait little know sure happen NYC. looks like China pace finish vaccinating bulk population fall, starting fall start giving boosters, either third dose inactivated shots, use mRNA shots booster.

The government target 70% population end year. vaccination process going slowdown due large rural population (urbanization rate around 60%) distribution effective cities.

Agree last part though - definitely going bad e.g. Indonesia pretty much rest SEA. Plus still active contact tracing trying isolate cases, hence going additionally disrupt transmission speed. us really hard time wearing masks? us perfectly comfortable them, like people. work mask on, see half time glasses fogged much exerted bit increase breathing rate.

Also, can't expect people wear masks forever. People need see people's faces; we're social species. Please link studies population means included review. Thanks. Sorry, typo areas seen case decline week? Interesting, thanks much taking time explain! Finna  get virus spread virus previously prevented spreading virus‚Ä¶ wouldn‚Äôt less effective? get virus spread virus previously prevented spreading virus‚Ä¶ wouldn‚Äôt less effective? kids school division putting vote, input experts, CDC, etc. mask schools. There‚Äôs also Change petition bunch anti maskers demanding school district remove mask requirements general‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. 

You can‚Äôt fix stupidity. places eat drink allow remove them. 

Yes, pretty much ineffective wearing mask 5% stay inside place. unless places like locked again, make sense mask mandate true hot hot outside, hand, places wear air conditioning. 

This true people who's workplaces require wear mask entire shift, regardless inside outside, like could said clothing. Yet one complains wash clothes. new thing people hard time adjusting. 

The effective masks create firm seal around nose mouth, like N95. feel least slight difference breathing wearing mask, probably effective.

I'm anti-mask, act wearing article clothing true.  Yes definitely stated original vaccine statistics, Delta certainly changed that. 

Look man, think good intentions idea talking overall hostility. pro-mask, pro-vax, done right things continue so. think vaccines still extremely effective clearly helped prevent worse outcomes outbreak, time ability vaccine prevent Delta infection clearly good previous variants. possible things true. Stay safe take care prevents symptoms, infections, high efficiency. take flu vaccines every year much less effective, still effective enough, key. one expects vaccine perfect defense. ....yeah gonna say. scan back mine, even returning shit store.  Yeah Florida's messing numbers again. around 400 week actually... lag around 3 weeks.  Number deaths go still goes initial data vaccine 98-99% effective preventing hospitalization

No - efficacy preventing hospitalization supposed compared unvaccinated people, point would hold 100% unvaccinated people get covid hospitalized - clearly true extremely pro-vaccine. seriously concerns me. rate vaccination infected hospitalized similar general population. casts doubt efficacy vaccine Delta variant. data needed bad news sure. Finally Wally World something right! Drum roll. vaccine offers protection variants. degree protection seems less delta. Nothing ‚Äúmoot‚Äù getting vaccinated, especially regards hospitalization death. unvaxxed people died either. can't believe many experts Twitter pointing deaths vaxxed people study proof vaccine works. proof anything deaths. (We studies that) far know, second. Actor's Equity Union requires six feet distance performers audience.

However we're going adjusting re-evaluating policies like situation develops next weeks.

But understand hesitancy sure counted breakthroughs resulted hospitalization. today CDC guidance vaxxed don‚Äôt need tested exposure. 

So numbers low. Way lower eventually find out. understanding dogs usually fair ok. Cats ACE2 common likely lethal them. know would‚Äôve actually really increased rates? stimulus got vaccines fucking lottery terrible odds. thousands breakthrough cases recent weeks, VA closer 100? 

I expertise here, one datapoint: [reports 389,426 last 14 days. Given population 6.9 million people, that's 403 tests per 100k people per day

VA reports average 9600 tests per day (pulled [this using figures last 7 days). Give population 8.5 million, that's 113 tests per 100k people per day.

So one potential confounder appears testing 3.5x many people VA per-capita basis. doubt would explain entire discrepancy, seems worth noting me. Judge much? Maybe wife died COVID. don‚Äôt know. got mine 3 months last infusion. üò≠ article:

According Walmart spokesperson, applies home office management level associates travel within United States. apply associates work stores, clubs, fulfillment centers distribution centers.

So non news. clickbait, please. believe said wanted week. Smoking reckless driving *are* indeed dangerous others, near level contagious danger viral outbreak. affected them, believe me, I'm letting h@lf-wits refuse vaccine kill off. that's works.

No sympathy me, full stop. Correct wrong, goal getting people vaccinated eventually make Covid less severe? certainly leader push one. got second shot 2 weeks Ocrevus infusion. I‚Äôm talking doctor booster shot without guidance CDC, sure go getting it.

Tho say he‚Äôd give order get found anywhere go. Thank you. hero need! killing [This fear-mongering. are? You‚Äôd live bubble entire life. didn‚Äôt even send kids daycare still like 5 colds kindergarten. Ugh. want move next town alone. Doubles annual property tax bill there, changes neighbors drastically. know that's true. I'd love nurses go Ratched assholes, that's sure! vaccinated, relax. Statistical independence nothing significance, without considering population means variances.

Better take stats classes again.  Forget sticks, need Chainsword. absolutely hate revel stupidity others, makes unimaginably excited think people still anti-vaxx ones majorly risk point.

I feel bad people whatever medical reason can‚Äôt get - rest them, fills little happiness. healthy person quarantined basement fiancee walking around upstairs? Interesting situation.  care anything hospitalization/death?

Should goal virus spread all? that's unrealistic, unless want live restrictions perpetuity. Daaaaamn! Accurate like sniper round temple! Dude. haven‚Äôt actively sub months. Came back, there‚Äôs whole lot fatalism negativity. less ‚Äúwe‚Äôre together‚Äù attitude amd ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs point?‚Äù Sad see. Provincetown, 90%+ adult population vaccinated outbreak occurred festival wouldn‚Äôt expect high amount unvaccinated people attend.

There vaccinated people infect, course overwhelming majority people infected vaccinated. get news article explains 5,000+ would infected similar outbreak occurred non-vaccinated community.

7 hospitalizations 0 deaths Provincetown positivity rate already fallen 15% 4.8%. vaccine supposed to. reminds bunch people said last year cats died covid üòø statistic hammered constantly. Tired shitty sensationalist headlines breakthrough infections. main goal prevent hospitalization death. best way getting vaccinated. Point understood. joined hip thing. still (vaxxed) best overall interest protect others catching it. also find reaffirming. also loved story nurse told ppl ‚Äúit‚Äôs late‚Äù became extremely ill begged vaccinated. would say sarcastically saccharine tone could muster. recommendation based higher increase breakthrough infections general well much higher R0.

This giant cluster outlier definitely something note figure out. think saying sample size cases small.

I'm saying sample size hospitalizations small. 

They different sample sizes (350 cases, 4 hospitalizations). think got excited vaccines original efficacy rates raised bar high started rolling out. Cases plummeted places like Israel thought vaccinates would end thing completely. Vaccines don‚Äôt add force field around individual repel virus altogether, train immune system fight disease contract naturally severity disease decreases. beginning, looked like viral loads diminished quickly immune system vaccination made far less likely spread virus others. isn‚Äôt case seems. despite fear mongering vaccines still keeping people protected serious disease. Pretty much every report showing hospitalizations almost exclusively unvaccinated folks severely immunocompromised. Plus, hear ‚Äúsymptomatic‚Äù infection breakthrough cases, conveniently never mentions severe symptoms are. runny nose fever 24 hours symptoms really cares end day. 

Covid likely around forever, build immunity it‚Äôs another cold it. We‚Äôll likely need boosters fine, however research seems indicate vaccinations give long lasting immunity severe illness (although prevention infection seem wane time).

My opinion get damn shots live life. don‚Äôt shots sorry made bed enjoy lying it. I‚Äôm going live fear longer. I've paying closer attention experts saying countries act together. envy Biden, started presidency real mess, would liked see CDC many things differently. poor judgement. pretty transparent number-fudging tactic led unwise policy decisions. mention, don‚Äôt win skeptics deception‚Äîyou embolden them.  wait whattt Yeah, Reddit headline deceiving article title even clearly states it‚Äôs employees: ‚ÄúWalmart require associates vaccinated October 4‚Äù 5th person unvaccinated.  claim question ""spreads easily vaccinated people"", portion people exposed outbreak vaccinated? cases general state demographics, vaccination status population present outbreak? Agreed. started eating restaurants say staff fully vaccinated. airline came statement, I‚Äôd fly them. I‚Äôm t-cell study. blood taken yesterday. develop antibodies vax (Pfizer) numbers plummeted weeks following. sure today keep joining studies condition. won‚Äôt get individual t-cell data hopefully there‚Äôs paper sooner later. blood first taken spring first antibody check early pre-print came last week. actual hell?

Reckless feels intentional. day scuba diver got swallowed whale

say fuckin' **WHAT** Yes still reduction. Asymptomatic individuals tend carry less viral load. Thus less likely pass statistically. Well say AP Disneyland went time. first time ever went Disney world got yelled immediately trashy lady trying get coffee lmao said taking precautions. take allll precautions wondering PrEP might play role potentially bigger spread.

Of course, many choices .... activities Provicetown would involve breaking social distancing many ways. Especially 1.5 years lockdown. often heard 97-99% *hospitalizations* unvaccinated, heard anywhere 99% cases were. don‚Äôt sympathy choice know consequences. Sucks family way too. dad included uncle/aunt even small kids teens. Hoping doesn‚Äôt happen man, annoyed rediculousness free vaccine.

They listened local pastor, news trust, ended ICU graveyard. 
they completely different informational diet. 
if announce vaccinated friends think going ""shedding disease"" (that's apparently latest crazy conspiracy) might it. 
it's just... think lot people fail understand: attack. united states population heavy disinformation attack going kill tens thousands people. Russia, China, reason big part Republican establishment helping population get crazier, paranoid, hating big parts america. 
These people read news, proclaiming proudly they'll never vaccinate - victims, perpetrators. encourage idiots anti-vaxxers. Remember Americans seriously considered injecting cleaning solutions one point. exactly decided it. goes wrong, we're screwed anyways.  Absolutely, fear release CDC attempt drive vaccination also universal mask-wearing will, looks worrying vaccine efficacy (by making look like zero effect) drive antivax movement general fear among general public (as CDC leaked slides mention) 'vaccines longer work'. pretty wild, Key West vibe, lots good restaurants funky art galleries. day scuba diver got swallowed whale, everyone talking it. mean matter weeks guy ICU begging people get vaccinated right? Seems trend people. large states, strict pandemic rules performed well cases better laissez-faire counterparts. California‚Äôs GDP shrunk less Texas Florida 2020, outperformed United States whole. Washington, strictest pandemic restrictions country, lowest GDP loss among large states. Thank you! I‚Äôll look this, use Roche 6800 every day :) lost taste smell 3 weeks. 6 months later, smell poop rotting meat, get random whiffs cigarette smoke, there's clearly nobody around smoking. Yeah, agree. people crazy covid fake bros. That‚Äôs slippery slope!  1000x contagious different 1000x higher viral load. Delta seems like 4x contagious.

If really 1000x contagious would infect everyone world like week. nuts bro. species faced far far worse gone fine. Malaria hammering developing nations since antiquity. It‚Äôs killed 150-300 million 20th century alone still wipes 500k yearly. Covid seems short term problem comparatively. Yep inevitable highly vaccinated population, numerically cases manage happen vaccinated people, even 100% unvaccinated people also infected. 'Christian rock singer' Fortunately Florida doesn‚Äôt lot old obese people , things could get bad /s welcome see pathetic, powerless victim people's deceit wish.

I specifically said case. Fuck fuck fuck fuck Sure thing. 

Point is, it‚Äôs available months. sooner people get vaccinated, fewer people get sick. I'm Fortune 50 company expecting update COVID guidance next week, response events week. 

In small group within larger company, supposed go back sometime September. Well, I'm permanent telecommute, others offices were. I'm sure changed. 'no mask vaccinated' rules change. articles stop stressing ‚ÄúmRNA need‚Äù. 

It‚Äôs type fuel fire conspiracy theories. probably could convince fence people take traditional traditional types vaccines. DNA altering theories floating around though makes people perceive agenda. Actually, goes complete way. People rural communities tend closely knit urbanites. seems people around person daily basis, less empathy feel them. One more: hospitals area filling up. hospitals building surge capacity maybe area lock down. I‚Äôm one those. Let mouth breathers fucking kill other. imbeciles vote, they‚Äôre making world better place round fashion. Please read article. It‚Äôs higher-level Walmart employees. doesn‚Äôt apply anyone would see working floor local Walmart. I‚Äôm surprised haven‚Äôt seen discussion it. fungal spread. vaccinated wore masks enough enough.

We‚Äôre fucked. can‚Äôt wait ‚ÄúI‚Äôm double vaxxed, ""I‚Äôve done part I‚Äôm wearing mask‚Äù remorse stories start they‚Äôve transmitted covid unvaccinated child

There's something wrong you... protect vaccinated folks too. let panic headlines fool you. Assuming immunocompromised anything, vaccine still effective keeping getting sick extremely effective keeping hospital.

Basically comfortable risk now, probably never go many things world equally likely hurt you. I‚Äôd like know well. Ya point, CDC director's answer vague could mean anything. info far know vaccines help dealing worst it, guess could still mean ""you safe"", fact vague there's many people know believe. 

The news anchor even said WHO's stance continue wearing masks. Yeah son 11 twin girls. Three years later simultaneously teaching shaving potty training. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I'm pretty sure true. know cave trolls voting us cannot wait get kids vaccinated. one less anxiety take list anxieties. prevent infection, least detectable replication transmissibility, matters. Even study referenced article vaccination prevented ~80% Delta detectable infections.

Delta replicates faster, people serum antibodies slower viral replication, least early stage infection. I'd fine saying using study proof vaccine works crazy. guess they're afraid fueling anti-vaxxers point they'll misrepresent studies require 4 weeks first second dose, 2 weeks second dose considered fully vaccinated.

So Oct 4 would 9 weeks Monday. essentially 3 weeks leeway.



Granted, many Walmarts vaccinating people. got mine one. day realized eligible. online registration screwed up, took anyway. I'm guessing worked would easier. schedule shot shift, day two off. wonder vaccinated We're also going overtake UK first doses next days (currently 88% UK 87% here) 8 week gap nothing I've read story (but different words) many times, I'm getting numb it. wrong. Oh sure, Facebook's report system utterly useless. reported racist comment ad featuring Indian woman Facebook said enough grounds removed

The comment almost verbatim ""Go back country"", btw duty require masks vaccines employees can't jobs home. Oh gosh kid awesome, good job mom/dad! DeSantis always private companies free want - besides vaccine passports, apparently. 

Honestly I'd love Disney vaccine passports see DeSantis tries do. Disney single largest employer state see wanting pick fight. Good post 6-12 months one way (vaccination Delta ripping unvaxxed creating natural resistance) pandemic completely dead see CDC blundering way week satirized every work crops up

Mark words Personally, like accurate timely information center is, know, disease control. know country lot idiots all, I'm certain idiots know CDC is, possibly think communists something. think they'd get vaccinated either way. word care. curse word involving ones anus. (Don't want get flagged) chickenpox analogy describe long COVID though. illustrate contagious is. significant portion people deny mask effectiveness. Let preface saying always wear they‚Äôre required

But find masks needlessly creepy depressing. take away much interacting people. Everyone feels like robot on. also can‚Äôt stand wearing heat trouble understand anything people say. They‚Äôre frustrating  temp usually lower side average, see 99 abnormal temp. vaccinated? Good analysis. think big obstacle Herd Immunity is... let us call it, stubbornness.  There's part herd want contribute. wasn‚Äôt delta, vaccines would enough end pandemic entirely west now. However delta fucked game us unfortunately asleep. close back square one. mind saw happened Israel Chile

The vaccinated dying en masse Israel, people think happening there? data indicates percentage fully vaccinated individuals experience breakthrough cases significant symptoms like you‚Äôve mentioned? way happens USA

Even summer Delta surge upcoming Winter surge Eventually legislation force kids vaccinated school. Delta affected younger people. stage state right protect kids parents won't. Quarters magnetic, bro. Make sandwiches moist delicious awesome mayo clinics workshop, duh! ‚ÄúCovid 19 likely long term symptoms beyond regular post viral syndromes‚Äù ‚ÄúCovid 19 hide cells reactivate‚Äù claims need sourcing. That‚Äôs absolutely useless age range looking health data. That‚Äôs pretty important distinction thing think would make worse ADE (antibody dependent enhancement)

From confirmed reinfections proven showing person contracting different strain later on, people got worse second time (right dying), mild case second time, similar effects time. 

There bunch possible reasons, could mix reasons. example, one people died reinfection started chemotherapy two infections, example. could also initial viral dose infection, reasons. read 3rd booster gives 100X antibody increase certainly incredible maybe enough stop even horrible delta tracks. 

However tough slog even get 2 vaccines peoples arms. Let alone 3. think need vaccine passports mandatory vaccinations enough uptake 3rd shot (and yes know equity considerations much world hasn‚Äôt even gotten 1 dose however give months world vaccine glut). Eventually legislation force kids vaccinated school. Delta affected younger people. stage state right protect kids parents won't.  place employment Georgia like 20% workforce COVID would expected hospitalization rate group based statistics entire group unvaccinated? think US large surges people knowingly went work sick Covid couldn‚Äôt afford stay home. _No one_ said vaccines make immune COVID, _do_ lower risk level flu common viral diseases. reduce 100-fold risk death, massive achievement.

For lot people, reasonable risk profile able catch friends activities elevated risk level. We're going back normal, might getting piece life back essentially risk level handling diseases. It‚Äôd nice vaccinate rest world first Ah yes, noticed uptick discussion illegal aliens, vaccinations COVID. latest talking point? looks like you‚Äôre New Jersey pretty strict rules guidelines, lead lower numbers hospitals weren‚Äôt overrun. reason lockdowns. 

For herd immunity, remove restrictions let virus play out, would run hospital medical facilities number infected would increase exponentially. 

I‚Äôm CA months November January hospitals overran pretty heavily strict lockdowns closures. 

This issue people don‚Äôt get, experience doesn‚Äôt equal everyone else‚Äôs. I‚Äôm glad hospitals weren‚Äôt ran, isn‚Äôt case herd immunity.   too, nice lasted üòû That's kind right now. Tired, associated socializing work lately. Woke almost like beginnings conjunctivitis. Little bit runny nose. Test results come back tomorrow, we'll see haha. did, yes. severe. crazy nasal congestion loss taste smell 12 days rich I'd put billboards around country. whole situation screwed up. Next time something like comes up, hopefully never, I'm seriously considering hiding employer working it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I two days left sick leave, obviously cover ten days. company vacation days either. hoping use vacation able now. feeling part rational one political party probably good financial sense allow older, sicker people die since reduces disability payments social security. However, since older people also vote particular way means voter base reduced. 
I also felt loss people strongly favor wearing masks overlapping heavily Venn diagram people also like guns. 
Thus see could paradigm shift government policy domestically also internationally. conflicts somewhat given China's expansionist policies. fair recommendation based original strain effect children much delta. Deltas fucking kids up. wearing KF94 masks work 8 hour shifts‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm vaccinated, don‚Äôt want get Delta variant unknowingly spread unvaxxed child work. Im getting anxiety dread covid going fall/winter. Seems like nightmare far over. fkn pissed adults choosing get vaccinated moronic. ""Learned"" bestest. Covfefe!1 Less likely =/= never

Again, case variants Delta. Even so, vaccinated person still less likely catch Delta unvaccinated person. I'd rather take chances vaccine. DEER GOD! know part. hear say close end pandemic. Well puzzling honestly. 50% state vaccinated, add % already got virus aren‚Äôt close herd immunity? That‚Äôs something don‚Äôt understand. understand difference covid positive hospitalized? weapon Tabletop game called Warhammer 40,000. basically Chainsaw Sword used various factions. one guys made real life. Michigan wolves. I'm fully vaccinated (Moderna) weather right now. symptoms mild flu, since need leave house I'm bothering test.  might Covid, may not; exactly wanted vaccine. vaccine didn‚Äôt keep anyone catching hospitalized

Um... no. study mention anywhere total amount people there. got tested. That's going give pretty jaded view. Literally got h1n1 2018. remember misdiagnosed sinus infection started getting worse antibiotics remember googling ‚Äúis dying feels like‚Äù; ended hospital basically could treat fever give fluids. never ever want experience again. 28 year old boxer(sport dog lol), honestly thought going die. 

I definitely want meet Covid-19 fucking form. know we're fucked lying us buy N95s full face respirators available?

Is wise entertain notion aren‚Äôt?  You‚Äôre excited?? You‚Äôre excited people dying? You‚Äôre sick Might something fact can't rely vaccinated people create Herd Immunity? move goal post back. Good don‚Äôt understand wanting fucking snack Broadway play.  hold stuffing face involved show.  It‚Äôs Marvel AMC Yea know get this. I‚Äôm really fucking tired travel Oregon week Florida next week. I‚Äôm definitely gonna catch it. Oh look edgy guy here.

Plenty anti Vaxxers Europe. 

With current developments clearly need 90% vaccinated won‚Äôt get Europe. Yeah Chise welcomed source balanced info. Definitely follow them. Great. California closed strict lockdowns Florida open, Florida going gangbusters. wasn't. preventing spread pandemic ""the damaging approach"". FL HEAVILY lied COVID numbers. FLs numbers actually way worse reported Scotland they‚Äôre not. Everyone know tried go earlier 8 weeks turned away.  don‚Äôt think ever tried all, remember school shootings? New free black middle class first Asian Hispanic communities invent rock basically gotten piled history since 1950

Stay strong people hell chainsword word make want one much? People dug camps. Anti-Vax/No Mask assholes going change. going disturbing watch. 

Hospitals filling JAX almost completely ICU beds. old obese dying. 

Restaurants already struggling staff getting hit Covid. worked biz, know people regularly work sick.  

It's gonna shit show. nihilist excited. father grandfather concerned newborn grandson. rest family vaxed. fear might become impossible protect him. P-Town predominantly affluent gay men. affluent gay men know vaccinated months ago, know anyone friend group (90% demographic) isn't, Massachusetts, one highest vaxxed states country.

You can't discuss numerator without looking denominator. ‚ÄúI keep running mailboxes crashing things‚Äù  

Uhh, perhaps maybe look ahead general direction forward trajectory instead rear view mirror‚Ä¶.? Phew. second scared going stop inundating 350 Facebook followers cute pictures cat. tiny bit worried I'd suddenly overcome urge believe science continued looks like I'm safe. husband's great aunt able continue say ""how cute"" every single cat photo post. never comments dog photos though. people really cat people. well killed predators.

Wolves, bob cats mountain lions ? know coyotes around go young deer, much grown ones.  Huh? able set small homeschooling pod husband goes back work? heard 3/4 sets parents pooling money hire private teacher group kids beginning pandemic. It‚Äôs cheap option it‚Äôs safer. Hope get chosen vaccine trial soon, especially son since can‚Äôt wear mask :( Great take. Thank you. people ‚Äúlet vaccinated get sick die, cares, I‚Äôm never anything pretending it‚Äôs 2019 ever again‚Äù camp find shit luck. outbreak began city 9 million people. way hell China getting control anytime soon. 1000x infectious Scott G. Estimating 1M infections USA every day - means missing reporting 900,000 - CCP cannot track prevent Delta ravaging country. Take numbers truck full salt apply 10x multiplier closer picture reality. Scary stuff. Australian scientists reporting expect yearly covid vaccines. flu varies year year virulence perhaps covid. never thought I‚Äôd take advice furry scientist, yet lol.

That well said, thanks information! Two reasons:

1 Even though vaxxed person might contagious w/ Covid unvaxxed person, unvaxxed population still receptive COVID infection said infected person due basically 0% protections it. 

So it‚Äôs kind #s game: let‚Äôs say vaccines 20% effective stopping Covid &amp; it‚Äôs variants outright... still 20% less people infected person likely spread to, whether infected person vaxxed not. Less infected people means less potential spreaders. 

When virus spreads, it‚Äôs like multiplier, &amp; decreasing amount potential spreaders, decreasing multiple hits low # longer ‚Äúpandemic.‚Äù

2 vaccines proven highly effective curbing hospitalizations, means pandemic becomes far less burden fully vaxxed population. important healthcare system overburdened, effectiveness health care system suffers significantly &amp; people die due lack resources proper medical treatment. 


So yeah, it‚Äôs big picture type stuff need think big picture b/c way ever going beat pandemic. runny nose fever, it'd fine, enough reports there, including vaccinated, show long COVID haulers (brain fog, difficulty breathing months, etc.) makes particularly worrisome Disney wants spend money food souvenirs. GF's family well Disney passes (Disney away Rona believe). used go multiple times year spend much money hotels park. get it, they're much Disney wants parks. course welcome dollar, know primary base. people visit year spend lot money stuff, events, special membership stuff. Triple crown vaccinations .. deer ticks, always present deer hang out. ticks vector transmit deer ? TL;DR Take one day time buddy. can‚Äôt snap fingers wish away. appears CDC want track breakthroughs.....because lot them. testing stopped, reporting said testing. fair, last couple days found vaxxed people spread virus. Checkmate atheists think unschooling? getting popular parents especially nuerodiverse children. gathered data 35 states identified 111,748 vaccine breakthrough cases end July, 10 times CDC‚Äôs end-of-April tally.""

It's useless fucking statistic drive clicks.

End April 30% US fully vaccinated Delta widespread.

Compare 58% fully vaccinated Delta dominant strain.

Obviously much larger amount breakthrough cases people vaccinated virus much contagious. Hope made covid-free. Thanks friend, need luck reminds much early covid days everything confusing conflicting Ah, okay. narrative (before today) usually opposite: ""even catch COVID, overwhelmingly likely asymptomatic"". there's never anything supporting narrative. n=450 data Massachusetts today seems slightly inconsistent, easily explained confounding factors (I assume young people partying ultra-high-exposure environment without age risk factors). T.i.l!! I'm going this. Thanks mean I've Provincetown before. plenty gay makes nowhere close 98% Vaccines need designed administration use, can‚Äôt take existing vaccines turn nasal mist oral vaccine. small number vaccine candidates ever designed route none fleet-footed companies use right now. I‚Äôm sorry family situation - parents using kids weapons despicable. glimmer hope kids get ill, chances kids fact fine. Texas school employee school age children. districts‚Äô hands tied pulling students send message reduce funding hurts schools. Abbott would happy withhold funds punish publicly funded schools low attendance. means keep kids home can, many parents state don‚Äôt privilege. point many others praying CDC steps mask mandate schools. seeing made feel better. 

Thank you. 6 months data mandated.they can't full approval June end. Ask know learned everything know politics twelve year olds pcm That's personal bet happens - yearly vaccine flu-level concern. 

But think really lot know, lot uncertainty future.  suspect contact human sewage, discharged untreated minimally treated local waterways. monitor Covid sewerage systems cities/universities. Seems probable route. would interesting also sample mammals vicinity (especially wild cats seems particularly susceptible virus). Fascinating stuff. Scary virus. Like 10 nurses work past month lol would able sign papers fast enough reversing Disney demanded going herd immunity. According CDC study there's ~84% (I forget exactly) chance asymptomatic numbers keep hearing news 97-99% hospitalizations unvaccinated. IDK much delta variant specifically. Either way vaccines work. think shows vaccinated mainly protected hospitalization could get sick vaccinated unvaccinated person. 

Because study sadly know % percentage original attendees vaccinated unvaccinated still know likely either group getting sick. Seriously, pulling overtime shifts get done. slowness costing lives. agency putting resources full review moment EUA granted UK seem country ""goes away itself"", ignore 90% first dose rate limited data far. ""It's interesting people die""

\- Henley, *Dirty Laundry* saying anyone votes democrat unconfident meek lmao Still doesnt make us better. obviously tell let patriarchy stand way actually forming opinions based facts even logical thinking. E.g. explaining someone shoots 5 people shooting 3 people doesn‚Äôt make better person 

Idiot Go vote authoritarians then. change want see world. 

Keep mind though, level auth even exist American political spectrum, maybe go live one party system China instead. Cases going Israel 7 day death average last couple weeks 0-2 really interesting. Thank explanation. I‚Äôm looking glimmer hope days. 

The world sucks right now. think risk high enough, many people wear masks forever certain higher risk scenarios.

I use sun screen lot situations simply reduce risk skin cancer. 

Places like Japan use masks certain high risk scenarios help manage disease risk. 

So, think congroversial think risk COVID stays certain level forever, continue see risk averse people using masks certain situations forever Yes Ah yes, basement dwellers true heroes virtuous. never said US citizens. may Canadians reside US. order get quarantine exemption, Canadian fully vaccinated, need special exemption. know ArriveCan app even requests vaccination documentation Canadian. I'm vaccination sets bad precedent business requires inject something.

Pretty sure illegal get tried court. started following American politics Covid, thought Florida sunshine state lots beaches fun theme parks. realize full complete morons headed Dr. Evil.

Things get better

My kids start start school month, friends 8 year old son died recently delta variant underlying conditions. I'll calm families safety hand bunch anti vaxx idiots (less 50% school district vaccinated). truly one dumbest takes I‚Äôve ever seen Reddit try going literally subreddit, people talking vaccinated infectious unvaccinated thousands upon thousands breakthrough cases. CDC fucked messaging media helped either. close square one. vaccines never provided complete immunity everyone likely take them, especially globally, always likely become endemic. bad PR CDC media misinterpreting data/sensationalizing it. interesting point. bronchitis feb-april shocked came back negative covid. figure ton people won‚Äôt even get tested they‚Äôre vaccinated, everyone know allergies (including dog) saying summer worst.

Where still lock down? talking lockdown? You‚Äôre putting strawman argument. It‚Äôs actually different. J&amp;J stabilizing protein. also continually increases antibody count least 8 months, [and works look vaccination rate Massachusetts, it‚Äôs 67%. average holds pretty true, except number vaccinated people caught actually higher  IE there‚Äôs much take away story without knowing many vaccinated people exposed total vs vaccinated people infected. also one died. ""74% residents Barnstable County Cape Cod received least one shot COVID-19 vaccine 67% fully vaccinated.""

This residents, including ineligible ones. percentage unvaccinated start matter less? hope feels better soon! Glad hear vaccinated, got amazing stuff working her. Yes, stated study older strains, vaccine efficacy around 95% preventing transmission. Redo math Delta efficacy rate, anywhere 16%-88% depending timeframe/study looking at. Combine nearly 100% chance exposure Delta something even contagious next year...

Yes, number still small (10%? Maybe less...) that's big gamble one's health... Oh, I'm sure remember. new, novel aspects event. Mainly use social media spread misinformation. mean, lots anti-vax propaganda traced back Russia. Think it. price FaceBook memes paid shills, Russia able turn America's thinking-challenged individuals dangerous bioweapons kill thousands thousands. single bomb bullet needed.

Yes Philly may 40% white, it‚Äôs around 50% white Philadelphians haven‚Äôt vaccinated. PLENTY Republicans certain pockets city, even though majority city voters registered Democrats. wait, really?

edit: holy shit, TIL us? go get third shot? issues arranging get getting paid etc? Reinfectuons lower vaccine efficacy infections, plus really high R0 delta. What. people rewriting history. Biden administration, main stream media without doubt led American public believe Vaccine would prevent getting Covid, would provide herd immunity got certain percentage. none true narrative changing people trying rewrite history. Christ sake Biden recently town hall still saying it. concerned able sit restaurant eat, rather restaurant workers safe? That's pretty callous. 

Here California, restaurants never shut down. take out/delivery only. ate ton take 2020.

It's pandemic. course impacts daily life. Act like adult suck up. you. Cdc totally reservation. Delta taken cases outher countries. Cases spike bit drop off. Delta another wave. Covid never going away. dont need wear mask fully vaxd. trying save people basically playing russian roulette. thanks. Get vaxd. live bubble people responded pandemic responsibility live high vaccination rate area.

It's incredibly hard believe actual people, internet trolls, honestly perspective take vaccine EUA would get vaccine soon full approval. think people voicing vaccines available EUA real intention take case, ""not EUA"" valid talking point use academically criticized for.

I believe seeing ""not long EUA"" rhetoric incredibly recently. months vaccine available general public. exactly thought. bad case influenza 12. scariest, miserable two weeks life. Bedridden, aching, unable move, could barely breathe, felt like death warmed over. absolutely nothing like even worst colds I've ever had. Completely different league. 

The thing even close misery got E. coli, even nearly scary (it really, really, really sucked though). 

My influenza experience part I've taken covid seriously. know feels like destroyed respiratory virus, covid-19 way worse had. I‚Äôm vaccinated tested positive week. didn‚Äôt even ask got test I‚Äôve vaccinated. tested positive, email follow call.

These stats inaccurate. one tracking. feel bad hospital workers. put bullcrap selfish people God wish people would stop holding NZ bastion covid. They're island, low population density minimal public transit. apt comparison 90% world lives (in metro areas) first time china deal delta, last outbreak Shenzhen dealt fairly quickly. take longer time, contact tracing still good right line drawing saying unvaccinated people likely stay home masked? Pretty different narrative lately.  Covid eradication still essential goal. see events past days, living virus comfortable situation. striving reach zero covid long term goal. can‚Äôt see us ever reaching place ignore covid, unless real ground breaking therapeutic along widely distributed delta-specific vaccine comes out. Right hospitalization rate still untenable Lol hope enjoyed trip You‚Äôll waiting rest life 1/3 number idiots voted Trump wanted to... but, dead, dying, prohibited voting states undermining voting... welp, that's way goes. Remember fever 102 6 straight days. Never missed flu shot that. thank you. Seems kinda greedy considering vaccination rates next door...

Yes, everyone wearing masks successful first thing people enter restaurant, go movies, visit bar club remove masks. You‚Äôre blind idiot. nuke hurricane! People freaking 3/4 900 sample size vaccinated.

For example, I've seen health experts offhandly say study shows vaccines work vaccinated person died it. unvaccinated person died either. *this study* tells us nothing efficacy death. really disagree point?

Where comment say anything think vaccines make immune covid? feel like going random anti-anti-vaxxer spiel, making specific point. sorry call BS.

a.) school districts need protect children. would say need stand require masks regardless ludacris executive orders, force hand school districts. frustrating districts around arent even recommending masks. say masks arent required allowed wear one want to. hide behind executive order site county health offices. county health offices recommend masking. fucking stulid.

b.) parents withdraw kids keep home either private virtual program homeschool ABSOLUTELY should. parents would hurting schools. falls back governor, TEA school districts failing kids providing safe options kids. sorry keeping kids home hurts schools doesnt fall parents.

Where right Delta, none applies national level. 

We enough information say masks work, mask mandate would tool used first, that's states.

The states rampant infections need flatten curve likely ones outlaws mask mandates, certainly lockdown.

Vaccines readily available anyone 12+ wants them, nothing gained lockdown front.

I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs significant part new cases people 40 though. never much doubt people 40 could test positive, word less likely seriously symptomatic hospitalized. Yes, yes are. Floridian here.. Hello, i'm asking here, asked searched everywhere no-one seems know.

I got vaccinated Pfizer got covid family member day. vaccines country really scarce, register soon can, no-one tell get it.

should get vaccinated soon can? wait weeks infected?

should get 2 doses 1 already one 2 weeks ago(and got covid that)?

please someone studies legit advice, really would appreciate it!  vaccines make safer death flu even get flu vaccine. safer drive get vaccine dying COVID. Sure could happen, vaccinated worried worried flu. pandemic unvaccinated, endemic vaccinated, live COVID point get boosters needed. would nice data supported opinion, doesn't.

We population slightly 328 million people, 35 million contracted covid around 614K died. That's little 10%. Meanwhile, 56% population least one vaccination. There's obviously crossover approximately 35mil who've gotten sick 56% vaccinated. Based alone, we've even scathed 70% herd immunity. over, data suggests rely previous covid infections immunity partially vaccinated immune Delta strain, sinking final percentage even lower. 

Yes, insane transmissibility Delta presumably add overall immunity, time virus enters cells hosts replicates, mutations inevitably occur, per nature viruses. Although likely little typos utterly useless, there's still chance one be. takes one, that's ended first place. essentially rapid-fire evolution, Delta *could* indicator direction virus evolving. happen night, we've gone something transmissibility comparable common cold something easily caught chickenpox short period time. 

I find pretty intellectually dishonest liken covid-19 coronaviruses past magnitude occurring today. Sure, possible common cold started coronavirus pandemic distant past, time, people (or even whatever iteration human could time) ability step plane go anywhere world. Mass globalization adds seriousness disease deeply changed dynamics virus recently become one transmissible diseases we've ever known. vaccines tuned Delta? companies applying authorize those?

Right now, though, Delta rampage, really seem like good time masks. Every little bit helps. Think want get vaccinated, hence mandated vaccines. Didn‚Äôt someone ask scientific research brushed off. W/truck nuts huge flags üòÇ sad eventually get forced join experiment tbh.

Ill gladly get vaccinated mid late 2022 wish would leave dont want experimented alone. Ill gladly wear mask keep distance, get tested go public ill even gladly give hospital spot someone get vaccinated. getting forced take vaccine gets new horrifying side effects added every month gross. one really refute argument sadly. blind downvotes people going wild.

You might thinking yourself, least thinking. hospital serves 10 counties. one Austin Copy pasted, classic. virus spreads 10x fast kills percentage people, kill significantly people, people infected. deadly sheer numbers alone.

Look Ebola. many people killed US? certainly deadly Delta variant. City Austin 70% ages 12+ least 1 shot, that's better Boston. Small government local control! overreach!

I've literally seen people claiming vaccine CAUSING emergence new variants - ""stop vaccinating virus stop mutating"". I've lost sympathy people. time make unvaccinated can't find work, get health insurance, travel public transportation, set foot government property, etc. one paywalled get enough keywords find open access article. seem stable going up, account reporting dips always happen certain days. July 19th reopening also starting affect number cases overall stability still pretty good result given still decent number second doses give out, first doses increasing bit due announcements restrictions, relatively high number cases filter increasing herd immunity. term ‚Äúall pregnant people‚Äù inclusionary. It‚Äôs excluding she/her way. also use they/them encompass unknown multiple genders language everyday. Good lord. school systems mandatory vaccines though, right? shits going years, doubt asking proof Covid vaccination HIPAA violation. Hell, even enroll classes campus UCF send immunization records. Funny

One crowd says problem 

Another denies it.

Great parallel know people u.s. say pelosi wants power making vaccine seems worse is. Covid ‚âà common cold.
Therefore vaccines needed.

Screw people, I‚Äôll take 3rd possible. Amen, anti mask stuff baffles me. gives? deer go wet market eat bat‚Ä¶. pcr positivity rate dropping following case numbers, testing rate still 8 times higher us example per capita Lmao, used virus busters (and advertised/put forward such), Delta goalposts moved purely preventing ‚Äúworst outcomes‚Äù. ""Say goodbye loved ones?"" None people Bear Week outbreak died. That‚Äôs interesting. Canada everything linked health card it‚Äôs checked basically anywhere go. 
Thanks insights! 
And yea mixed Pfizer Modena Canada well we‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs least effective double vaccine. downsides far we‚Äôve heard P Town gays call  Yep. Another way look is‚Ä¶

If 70% population vaccinated vaccines absolutely nothing, you‚Äôd expect 70% covid hospitalized people vaccinated.

So less 70% vaccinated hospitalizations means it‚Äôs working. Agree, doses going waste expiring. agree messaging horrible frustrating, right. wear mask, I'll it. Many employers healthcare industry required vaccines decades. know CDC counts it, controlled studies UK Canada showing almost 90% protection two shot vaccines.

As well, many states keep track vaccinated vs. unvaccinated positive tests. usually show least 80% difference.

Also, consider exceedingly rare occurrence severe symptoms vaccinated people. willing keep isolating avoid potentially sick couple weeks? Especially considering future treatments horizon, absolutely must avoid chance getting all, going long time.

It's make personal health decisions. make sure look big picture consider aspects physical mental health. here, fill paper form basic data get jab sit 15 mins, ""background check"" per say. I'm also thinking getting Pfizer shot, got Moderna doses back Jan/Feb read interesting study higher antibody levels mixes vaccines. Yeah you‚Äôre right fact antibodies don‚Äôt last forever, also add antibodies aren‚Äôt factor immunity. think could‚Äôve phrased little better. However theories (I think Pfizer brought up) efficacy wanes overtime (without factoring variants). could Pfizer trying make money think Israel raised possibility issue. think lot people would keep semi-annual shots there‚Äôs probably lot wouldn‚Äôt. said annual minimum that‚Äôs often you‚Äôre supposed get flu shot people don‚Äôt seem problem  teacher I'd say everyone else household student vaccinated necessitate another year home.

I say taught remotely last year honest God think hardly educated anyone year.

The main difference last year every adult able get vaccinated. still worry health students young get vaccine primary concern kids bringing home well definitely ways abating that. Curious would work?
Wouldn‚Äôt check records see last dose was, insure aren‚Äôt getting soon, realize you‚Äôve already 2 turn away?   sure. I'm definitely looking forward onslaught common colds post pandemic, whenever is. interesting get better understanding usual ailments knowing likely rule common colds. You‚Äôre dealing thing too? know still required wear masks, don‚Äôt faith people using, never nose‚Ä¶

But yeah, least kids able get vaxxed, masks absolute must right now. I‚Äôm glad point choice, I‚Äôm going make safe one. they‚Äôre insanely busy expensive I‚Äôm thinking buying N95s. studies immunity taking 2 sinopharm vaccine doses extra pfizer dose. immunity better took 2 pfizer doses?   hard time trying figure do. live California local numbers down.. don‚Äôt want put kids risk.   vaccine hesitant rejecting Australia around 25%

So 70 80%?

Tough target. impossible, doubt within capacity ScoMo within reasonable timeframe sneak food Disney Parks. bring food want. Heck yeah. Hopefully corporations follow suit company.  definitely ""yes"" extroverted dude. saying ""less likely"" lists several contributing traits. Obviously extroverted person less likely comply restrictions introverted person, restrictions much line introverted person's regular lifestyle. I‚Äôd whatever asked me. It‚Äôs hard go clinic. time, pretty bad second dose reaction. Hope avoid again. 

As waning antibodies, happens every disease. think chickenpox antibodies floating blood right now? FDA approval? assume approve vaccine low efficacy dominant strains. Numbers never lie, lie numbers. Every 6-month COVID shot turns breakthrough infection Standard Issue Cold 1d3-1 days sore arm feeling vaguely crappy: Sign up!

Every 6-month COVID shot turns breakthrough infection Standard Issue Cold 1d6-1 days sore arm + ""flu-like symptoms"": OK. Fine. :sigh: that's win case, it.

It‚Äôs also end world get Covid. wanna change perception. Austin ..and guests? CDC says around 30k vaxxed per week getting covid, makes sense. Temper that, course, estimated 300k unvaxxed getting infected (and wouldn‚Äôt know, leads 88% protection vaccines use numbers calculate. unvaccinated people otherwise strongly compliant vaccinated people (e.g. socially distance more, meet smaller groups, wear masks more) still case unvacc bigger risk transmission? situation country, vacc allowed venues without distancing mask requirements. moronic take. Right. Someone mentioned day that, city, 10% COVID patients hospital vaccinated. sounds bad, 70% city vaccinated. back envelope calculation based 70% population vaccinated 95% efficacy rate vaccine(for preventing serious illness), would expect 10% patients vaccinated. 

Let‚Äôs say 90 unvaccinated COVID patients. vaccine nothing all, would expect 210 vaccinated patients, 7 vaccinated people every 3 unvaccinated people. But, say 95% vaccinated people would protected needing hospitalization, would expect 10.5 vaccinated people hospital instead 210. 90 unvaccinated people 10.5 vaccinated people, would 10%. Abbott busy trying find responsible power grid failures. I‚Äôd go far say he‚Äôs charlatan.

Same principle: mask protects patients. no, doctors dont particular mask fetish: find uncomfortable u do. dont wash hands gives us pleasure. 

We dont exercise hard enjoy muscle fatigue. comment user name fitting match given situation.  FT September, we‚Äôve already started going back it‚Äôs mess. Every week get notice employee tested positive Covid (unclear it‚Äôs breakthrough not). Yet nothing‚Äôs even shut day clean. There‚Äôs data contact tracing leads us believe vaccinated person gets sick infect others, masking recommended again.

But vaccinated people less likely get sick unvaccinated people first place. comparison, every unvaccinated person much likely catch spread covid, well need hospitalization, straining burnt healthcare workers possibly taking beds people need medical procedures important immediately life-threatening. Wuhan city world outbreak bad enough cause large number oxygen desaturated people faint streets. really bad city worse Wuhan did, state media's admission. good! Wearing mask hold back society.

Unfortunately every state/county reports every day may encounter issue place big glass dome Alberta?

The populations occurred likely substantially higher vaccination percentage. Yes Americans really lucky. People elsewhere queuing vaccines. Good question. Answer? Mutations.

Covid mutations (like DELTA) happen widespread contagion.

While China laughed India's suffering (on social media), rather help more... look happened! ignored exploding spread next door end Delta, new version that's far infectious.

Mask up. not.

This particular virus thus far evolved spread faster. Delta slightly deadly OG Wuhan most, data isn‚Äôt obvious. expect suddenly become 10x 100x deadly.

We‚Äôre cusp total population immunity. Vaccine + natural immunity get us Thanksgiving. Delta spreading crazy fast, thanks vaccines cases serious.

So odds virus evolve defeat vaccines and/or become radically deadly? one knows.

Humans dealt coronaviruses since forever. Every often one explodes, kills bunch people, fades background. expect one like others. Except time vaccines radically successful. champion. wonder efficacy rates would imply FDA approval People kids squeezing vacation school starts. August busy month theme parks despite weather hell coughing deer?  moment lifted mask recommendations goal reached lost Android OS suck though preggo women identify women? Agreed - though reading article sounds like talking 'reported' side effects (i.e., side effects doctors submitting agencies review), reduce scope 'side effects' discussed here.  Yet another groundbreaking story pages medical journal, DUH think overreacting. think right thing. think overreacting. think right thing. breakthroughs greater percentage part mild. Sure severe cases it‚Äôs far fewer. Many get breakthrough get something akin allergies, cold flu. 

The whole mask mandates larger issue hand. large swaths population unvaccinated. say vaccinated gets little sinus drip thinks nothing it. It‚Äôs delta variant. go Wal-Mart Target shopping. almost guarantee lot vaccine holdouts unmasked don‚Äôt believe Covid expose 30-40 people. They‚Äôve got protection they‚Äôre ones ending ICUs, flooding hospitals, even higher viral loads spread even people. That‚Äôs real issue hand here. CDC isn‚Äôt concerned percentages breakthroughs ending hospitalized. They‚Äôre worried large swaths vaccinated asymptomatic carriers don‚Äôt even know they‚Äôve got anything outside allergies seasonal colds. 

Another factor mildly symptomatic vaccinated person presenting cold like symptoms sneezing they‚Äôll spreading place. Abbott doubled banning mask mandates schools... Including public elementary schools single child vaccinated come first day school...

We 7 year old honestly, terrifying time we've spent last 16 months everything could keep kid safe. TLDR: article based modified SIR-model. authors vaccine resistant strains likely emerge subsequently grow populations where

* individuals vaccinated
* individuals infected.

So partially vaccinated population ideal breeding ground vaccine resistant strains. authors obviously support vaccinations, also give following One simple specific recommendation keep transmission low even large fraction population vaccinated implementing acute non-pharmaceutical interventions (i.e. strict adherence social distancing) reasonable period time, allow emergent lineages resistant strains go extinct stochastic genetic drift. implementation non-pharmaceutical measures time high vaccination also help reduce infectivity efficacy vaccines perfect69. Additional factors may make measures even effective are: (1) increased widespread testing, (2) rigorous contact tracing, (3) high rate viral sequencing positive cases58,70 (4) travel restrictions. Finally, model formally considers one homogenous population, data also suggest delays vaccination countries relative others make global emergence vaccine-resistant strain likely. Without global coordination, vaccine resistant strains may eliminated populations could persist others. Thus, truly global vaccination effort may necessary reduce chances global spread resistant strain. I'm curious. opinions Dr. Eric Feigl-Ding sub informs opinions? Thanks pointing out!

There's also constant misinformation conflicting information masks work all.

I think way US government handled entire pandemic resulted lot people caring say anymore getting answers ""right wrong"" sources. 

I think comes trust government way many politicians constant scandals, lies manipulation, can't really blame people trust them.  correct sober take situation. 

As much anger feel hearing takes ppl wanting complete totalitarian government .... Empathy important.

It matter person antivaxxer someone thinks ppl without vaccine permanent house arrest. ever change anyone's opinion strong issues least empathic ended way. Mental health clearly sacrificed last year sub good example it.

Keeping six feet apart little nothing, especially indoors still air. eyeballing world case graph Bing Covid graph, looks like current rate increase steepest ever been.  
The last worldwide wave September March brought Delta variant.  
Chances new variant concern already brewing come global wave entering right now. 

As evidenced article though, sure much way real options here. 
The 70% mid 2022 referenced means another year could fully uncontrolled growth affected countries. 
The world hasn‚Äôt even seen vaccination rate hit 15% look @ stats individuals fully vaccinated. 

I‚Äôm happy couple / months relative low activity summer, fear overwhelming sense (at least America) past premature. far I‚Äôm concerned trying cross border illegally.

The irony. tactical plan misses strategic consequences.

If mask high transmission rate, leave areas catch up. Again, worried *everyone* unvaccinated?

When say ‚Äúworry more‚Äù one group another, sending message it‚Äôs important everyone vaccinated. showing restrictions me.

Regardless, Delta variant information, focusing story vaccinated 29 year old resident went back pre-pandemic activities, socializing, bar hopping, sorts indoor activities lots people, unmasked, developed covid-19, sick couple weeks various symptoms.

Even delta variant, vaccinated never meant immune. meant reduced chance getting sick, reduced severity symptoms, reduced morality rates.

All holding up.

Some places telling false story get vaccinated go back life usual. live bay area think ever told story. 

But pandemic single-person problem, thinking got vaccinated meant could resume carefree lifestyle pretty ignorant perspective. consistent rhetoric going longer-term issue, even stories delta variant started circulating. sucks CDC flip-flopped messaging handled information regarding delta variant effectively. seriously doubt it. vaccine basically gives dose covid spike proteins way harmless you. let's immune system build antibodies defend future infection.

If already infected, would loads spike proteins (attached virus) floating around body detecting making antibodies anyways. Adding spike protein help anything. love this. Make bleed Lamar Jackson got again.  think take Reddit massive grain salt. First - anyone make personal stories. Second - ones posting always going experience. Third - Reddit, large community, albeit vacuum particular sub, seeing 50+ posts literally thousands daily users sub. 

Personally, don‚Äôt know anyone vaccinated tested positive, therefore don‚Äôt post about. Stay healthy best wishes! deaths current year vaccines. facts presented; *‚ÄùHuh? What? never said that!*‚Äù 

When fact , u/Maeby78 say that. October 13, 1971 plan explaining myself. 

Each time speak mask policy, there's least people sincerely can't believe small group adults capable behaving like level headed adults. 

Honestly says lot staff. Dating sucks matter hat‚Äôs you. believe CDC best practices around dating activities sex may want go looking those.

Beyond that, there‚Äôs certainly complicated risk calculus here. Pretend date chicken pox. willing catch chicken pox? willing able quarantine get tested dates get sick? Further, contact unvaccinated persons (children, immune compromised) therefore willing able quarantine date? heart willing make different ethical choice next couple months go outdoor dates also vaccinated?

And beyond you‚Äôre date indoors wear mask.

Some people may tell that‚Äôs overkill I‚Äôm highly risk averse YMMV. Hey, wear masks less problem. vaccinated wear masks. OP hurt 

A couple recently caught forging vaccine papers. charged 40K fines. 

Its extremely stupid thing talking tests get sick, ones used enter certain activities like indoor dining events. must know Israel well think would ever entertain listening anyone else anything. many health 18 month olds died covid. 18 month old likely flu. idea requiring masks though. makes sense. think researchers research internet points validation hopes random online ""news"" company make clickbait article research? I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre talking ‚Äúrefusing‚Äù (of course state mandated I‚Äôd it) wear mask people refusing get vaccinated union employees already paid getting vaccinated, they're talks unions requiring I'd surprised offer more. virus spreading causing death/severe illness requires hospitalization.

Holy shit, sub really full Covid deniers downplayers. hospitals across Florida, Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana right COVID hospitalizations record high, even higher winter. stop spreading misinformation virus causing death severe illness. delta tends severe.

Second all, personal risk analysis community risk analysis. Obviously, place like Vermont vaccination rates high, virus low, vaccinated, lot less worry about. Let's get way.

But I'm talking places. I'm talking generally, country, yet. okay living country many hospitals overrun? Missouri hospitals full, okay that? know affects quality care, go hospital, right? get car accident ER local hospital full, okay that? Covid would done already lockdowns. 

Due constant lockdowns destroying people's lives, jobs, economy forced suffer longer longer covid. Polling form research. one would personally ever use favorite read studies form research same. People enjoy face covered seeing people‚Äôs faces interactions? exactly rocket science  Good them. Every company require since people shown they're incapable making common sense decisions themselves. I'm seeing ton users posting know (insert rather large number) people suffering symptomatic breakthrough cases. one know single person got Covid vaccination?

I rather large social circle involves many high risk individuals. Healthcare, police, elderly, families kids,etc. taking little preventative measures like staying home, masking out. 

Obviously, understand personal anecdotes are, well anecdotes. find hard believe *so* many users know people breakthrough cases. seriousness, would vaccine dose infection anything? vaccine rate people 50? Maybe got fake vaccines something absolutely working delta Canada. folly rely solely vaccine eliminate virus. multiple tools disposal. 

The anti-vax movement largely foolish, responsibility populace determine course virus. Everyone watch Florida, petri test dish. Governor actively wants kill base, Mayor's breaking laws trying save people, mask mandates schools. fall going cause much heartache unreal.

He's really 100% population vaccinated course 100% new cases would also. Even allegation true, doubt that, still support conclusion without information. 

The vaccines safe effective preventing disease death. 100% effective - vaccine that, particularly type virus. safe effective enough helpful 1,000 times. Far effective hoped pursuit vaccine undertaken.

The effectiveness preventing spread virus less, working understanding much less order determine essential masks and/or respirators slowing spread *in addition vaccination*. bearing whether people get jab. Everyone medically able get vaccination soon available. lockdowns months. Everything open. Indoor dining included. months now. 

Canada big place. Cases much higher provinces compared us. really vaccines + masks. upset something? mean insult, state fact. 

You truly idea talking about. risk someone dying COVID (not accounting health, age, factors) estimated 0.4-0.6%. 1/25 .024%. That's 3/12,500. That's odds take Also Canadian here. think anyone say sure, expect anything like lockdown going forward; think border likely remain closed unvaccinated, though. promising HOWEVER study period doesn‚Äôt seem like takes account Delta unfortunately. Looks like delta raise base breakthrough infection rate. would essentially mean vaccinated people around 98% protected real life studies ‚ÄúDemographic don‚Äôt like, find stupid, aggregating study finds also doesn‚Äôt wear masks‚Äù 

I feel like keep seeing demographics depicted like  I've heard numerous stories people hardcore lockdown still catching neighbor. could possible perfect conditions covid carried breeze quite distance.

Also, hospitals lose millions millions dollars due cancelled surgeries. Take grain salt, P-town huge tourist town leans *hard* left.

Well choosing either vaccination disease.

The disease sucks. Ask anyone, especially /r/hermancainaward former. Bats Civets humans big jump, big. feel way. kids young get vaccinated one immune compromised. I'm vaccinated course, keep masking distancing, stew rage people damn thing stop virus.  want people refuse vaccine die unable pay hospital bills? 

Why advocate murdering outright? stopping willing go far? already advocating something disgusting is.  That's need vaccination passports. stand corrected... home PCR Parents would complain, and? Someone said well one comments here: ""many schools issue enforcing school uniforms"", lot simpler justified. Nah, hard enforce. simple easy enforce. say main difficulty enforcing ""parents would complain"" really problem all. Sorry that. could see thought talking you. responding poster lot see people saying threads. :) physics smoke particles viral particles air pretty much identical, understand.

US, people started willing wear seatbelts insurance company told wouldn‚Äôt cover accident didn‚Äôt seat belts on. 

Same thing motorcycle helmets. 

The really important downside, though, people go get Covid test pay it, they‚Äôll walk around spewing virus everywhere. already people don‚Äôt go get test don‚Äôt want quarantine it‚Äôs positive. Exactly. Delta overwhelms antibodies people 1000x number viruses upper airway. antibodies needed defeat that- necessarily different specific ones. Also one thing studies fail take account people show mild symptoms vaccinated much likely get tested unvaccinated group. Many unvaccinated group either don‚Äôt believe Covid real, and/or believe test results made part conspiracy, and/or believe it‚Äôs like flu don‚Äôt get tested get flu. Plus testing positive often admission wrong past 2 years. People go extreme lengths make appear weren‚Äôt wrong blathering Facebook 2 years. So, many times, see positives people they‚Äôre hospitalized. Unless take group people half vaccinated half test every week whether symptoms can‚Äôt infer anything really likely get you‚Äôre vaccinated vs not. crazy me. statistical odds true one trillion, I'm forced conclude someone lying family members dying, fuck that? guy friend actually tested positive Covid vaccination, he‚Äôs know has. want avoid getting sick high level neutralizing antibodies paramount. B cells great fighting infection takes hold antibodies prevent virus getting foothold first place. long people take vaccine,

Sure, point yet. point, I'd agree 100%. unfortunately at. That's spread still concern. people throughout world want still gotten it. Japan, example, like ~20% fully vaccinated something like that? US 50%. imagine concerned virus spreading.

Yes, personally might fine fully vaccinated. personal risk != community risk. Take look hospitals family go regularly sick injured. okay idea 100% capacity might get bed emergency room get sick? personally not. Oh... great way make unvaccinated not... get vaccinated. shittiest paper cards imagine US. Maybe 120lb paper best, 3""x4"", larger credit card fits nowhere comfortably. worst design could imagined get. Exactly. used live San Diego speak truth! say let's both. mandate one thing left individual's discretion ? Massachusetts, hospitals absolutely overwhelmed.

And yet highly vaccinated counties flagged unvaccinated counties parts country. school board voted make masks optional, even among unvaccinated. peak redditor know it‚Äôs like probably politically correct say there‚Äôs decent chance that‚Äôs case lol parent two kids 12 extemely keen seeing data. statistics healthy kids 12 bad outcomes covid large. statistics adverse event vaccine better statistically significant benefit, data lie, think prudent see data first assuming outcome. trying force simply acknowledging ""hey people psychological makeup tend behave way""? know would really help see things, actually read article actually complained mean complain about. pretend issue methodology issue actually subject matter? think would sound like legitimate complaint? I'm honestly curious know reason behind behavior. mean helpful ? Studies studies shown people low vitamin d, diabetes obesity shown worse symptoms ? public health messaging fit healthy also voluntarily take vaccination added measure ? Night time awesome.

I‚Äôm Disney planning group question ‚Äúhow pay trip‚Äù comes occasionally ‚Äútax refund‚Äù always number one answer. biggest (most recent) mistake made reversing mask guidelines/mandates begin with. let cat bag soon. Getting back now‚Ä¶ we‚Äôll let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs cat covered coconut oil. Canadian, wish fine more. feel entitled enter country break rules. Relying covid tests seems like failed strategy me. covid test shows *were*, *are*. like trying drive looking car's back window.

For matter, relying people vaccinated also seems obsolete thinking Delta variant era. starting look like vaccinated people unvaccinated people getting spreading Delta roughly rate. Fortunately, vaccinated people seem getting sick.

Large numbers people died normal flu. Extraordinary steps limit people's freedom destroy economy never taken flu, even bad years. 

If care lives lost support forcing people exercise eat right? Assuming could that, would save far lives anything covid.  CDC far failed shout roof tops. preliminary, yet headlines like :

BREAKING: CDC CONFIRMS VACCINATED PEOPLE SPREAD DELTA RATE UNVACCINATED

This ridiculous caused many people believe vaccines work actually really effective according data! CDC cites 75-85 percent effectiveness infection seen single headline say yet. Whats worse headlines influencing local governments implementing restrictions. What‚Äôs objection calling women people? saying women aren‚Äôt people? That‚Äôs less .0006% children US. Hardly number even remotely consider forcing millions children wear masks. see, mistake then. Good continuing wear mask. I'm seeing way many people say done clearly good reasons so. Children spread covid people risk said yesterday, news conference, he's seriously considering new mask mandate. expect announced Monday latest. It‚Äôs reported state immunization registry. two kids 12,love wearing masks stretch. get complaints, without issue. Florida, CVS wants $139 PCR test. seems COVID become cash flow operation. They‚Äôre Hemorrage even extended lockdowns took seriously wouldn‚Äôt issue. long covid confirmed delta breakthroughs, won‚Äôt surprised vaccines longer work. I‚Äôm expecting another lockdown don‚Äôt see pandemic ending probably two years. Yes, think devolving decision-making lower level jurisdictions turning badly. situation changing rapidly, people getting information media national scope. know what's happening Missouri what's happening state.

Instead consistent long-term set policies followed everywhere, people throwing hands. Yeah, finally someone says this. People scared lashing fear CDC one targets. group responsible messaging agonizes wording weeks know important be, say science indicates. one getting public health money rather want help, yet reward months months agency-wide deployments details end sight public abuse. read two conflicting articles. One said 4 5 hospitalized people vax'd (hence 80%). said hospitalizations 4 vax'd people. going first. true. data variant causes fewer deaths even less severe illness. Data UK actually shows increased hospitalization rate. Fewer deaths wave due older population vaccinated, better informstuon caring critically ill (oxygen management, steroids). Also lot vulnerable already died. opinion get damn shots live life. don‚Äôt shots sorry made bed enjoy lying it. I‚Äôm going live fear longer.

Except ‚Äúmild‚Äù covid means ‚Äúnot hospital.‚Äù data 2 dose mRNA prevents long covid. Delta vaccinated people produce infectious viral load unlike it‚Äôs performance previous infections puts children (delta severe cases younger) unable (not unwilling) vaccinated risk. Also 12% state‚Äôs hospitalizations vaccinated delta predominant variant. That‚Äôs insignificant. Boosters vaccine mandates would easily stop delta tracks. taking ‚ÄúI got mine‚Äù attitude unsustainable long run especially holidays right around corner. really important study. We've waiting while. hang little longer needed common good.

Upper middle class ~~white~~ people. fixed you. ""Study finds 98% people killed injured skydiving wearing parachute"" strain healthcare system long-term long-covid neurological complications caused even mildest covid infections shows bad idea. what?

In ideal world, I‚Äôd rather see public policy messages sound like ‚Äúvaccinated people, what‚Äôs happening, need protect yourselves.‚Äù Basically stop addressing unvaccinated don‚Äôt exist don‚Äôt matter anymore. subtext being, ‚Äúit‚Äôs ok lose you.‚Äù know would inhumane adopted public policy, that‚Äôs would like see. I‚Äôm sensing certain current hesitancy starting develop past week. delta news starting raise people‚Äôs caution levels slightly.

And account cases severe side effects affect children rest lives. 

You shocked know kids died wearing mask. Wait, Disney pass getting $30 month?! want one! Lol I‚Äôm sucker, apparently - cause I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm paying way more. boosters happen, likely once.

""breakthrough"" infections *way* mild unvaccinated people. Texas, every person since grid went Feb... Maybe stop paying unvaccinated hospitalizations. longer anti-vaxxers refuse shot, longer rest us continue pay costs covid. plenty states seeing increases hospitalization rival last winter summer.

Plenty states don't, well, see check NY, NJ CA. latter two seem indicate upwards trajectory they're nowhere near last winter. course, time tell characteristics current wave are.  absolutely incentives like this. Require proof vaccination venue exempt mask mandates. CDC include guidance mind-boggling.  i‚Äôm curious getting 3rd dose, help us delta? antibodies means protection? Conservatives nations always embraced cancel culture. 

Look I'm sorry tell but, psychology shown us frequently, people similar attitudes beliefs behave similar ways. Sometimes helpful figure attitudes beliefs associated behaviors. feeling personally attacked actions correlated certain psychological makeup, think issue might you... opinion becoming dangerous, governments politicians, woke mob able tolerate different opinions.

Ah see gunning ""cancel culture"" stuff trying use word. I'm going beat around bush here. obvious another conservative engineer know anything people thinks knowledge engineering means sort *extra* knowledge science. see TIME. want tell you, bottom heart, wrong. one cancels culture like conservatives. research showing certain personality traits linked certain behaviors cancel culture. Getting man fired simply gay certainly cancel culture. ""woke"" crowd that. I'm honestly disheartened dishonesty. You, me, everyone else alive KNOWS conservatives readily embrace cancel culture make dangerous express opinions. opinions ""black people equal"" ""gay people allowed get married"", conservatives cancelling people views centuries. cancelling, mean murdering. Stop acting like equivalent THAT. work government people think works. 

The reality lockdown ever lifted, masks social distancing required doors, large gatherings outdoors indoors. disagree. correcting potential misstatement Provincetown study. comments There's life outside US. Get know it. None said ""we benefit kids' contribution herd immunuty."" Sounds though we're agreement, friend. talking about? There's ton Austin, especially like outside. There‚Äôs whole lotta serious illness lasting implications death. It‚Äôs enough survive thing. deaths, also hospitalizations ""long-haulers"" well. goal point continue push vaccinations, let virus run course, ensure hospitals don‚Äôt get overwhelmed.

""It's also complicated fact may even distribution immunity,"" Meyers says. herd immunity threshold usually presented single, overall percentage population. given city, ""you may hear numbers like 50% population immunized. really 50% every single neighborhood? pockets high levels immunity pockets low levels immunity?""

The distinction matters. east side city immunized west side isn't, outbreak could still spread quickly unimmunized area overwhelm hospitals.‚Äù  need follow this.  July 30th Iowa rather low rate cases. 

Cases: 333 average

Hospitalized: 232 (14 day average 133%)

Deaths: 2 They‚Äôve clearly never surveyed Manchester then. It‚Äôs 95% mask since Freedom Day round here. It‚Äôs like light switch flipped. great idea. Let's make harder people likely disease get tested.

These population. I'm talking people masked whole time, anti mask crowd. missing entire point article. NYC massive early outbreak employed measures effectively decreased cases deaths. Texas didn‚Äôt early outbreak, didn‚Äôt follow measures deaths state. Texas could limited prevented deaths using effective measures like NYC.

There really excuse Texas learned lessons limiting transmission saved lives. I'm Canadian - 100,000 surgical cases backlogged province, diagnostic services delayed, people died cardiac issues waiting care - health care system swamped.

Universal healthcare mean anything capacity used COVID patients. hell looking at? see getting steeper steeper downward last data point. Doesn‚Äôt matter (but no). argument holds true. states balance voters one looks (I‚Äôm sure outliers). That‚Äôs said ‚Äúmore politics‚Äù - gotta read whole thing friend.

Generally articles like simply lying, counting every death happened vaccine without definitive explanation caused vaccine. Unless sure argument made good faith, would ignore it.

Safety COVID vaccines remains significant concern, especially may forced choose vaccination infection under-12s. achieve herd immunity Delta need 83% whole population vaccinated 100% effective vaccine.. doesn‚Äôt exist.   ridiculous amount Pfizer vaccines (100m so) available weren‚Äôt exactly struggling supply office mandating employees return full-time September, show intention changing plans. also requiring proof vaccination masks, terribly reckless.

Unfortunately lot Americans share childish view. need listen stories. Listen, pretend listen get point in. article actually gives split well. 68% unvaccinated 30% one dose EU vaccination program might slow start, purchase enough Pfizer doses give everyone 2 boosters per year end 2023. understand correctly boosters made Ireland, completely separate supply chain impact deliveries pf Pfizer vaccines countries. never vaccine second thrid year pandemic. look UK numbers, deaths January peak around 16 days cases peak. 59,417 cases peak translated 1,244 deaths 16 days later (peak). look todays 7 day rolling average deaths 72, count back 16 days cases 34,571.

I hope never go hospital wish family members could smile intubated. Who's Pizza Anyways came conclusion early pandemic, control behavior. protect yourself, try persuade dummies, drive even away truth. figure themselves, usually late. Unfortunately, us pay price.  Lol dumb. Everything use likely made China. cookware , utensils everything. I‚Äôm frustrated don‚Äôt know think.

CDC hasn‚Äôt given context Provincetown seems uninterested so. afraid talk Bear Week something?

But then, experts saying study shows ‚Äúvaccines work‚Äù. think vaccines work (because studies) study proof all, considering well unvaccinated relative vaccinated people (no deaths either, lower hospitalization % per confirmed infection). Pointing out, example, vaccinated people died study tells us NOTHING efficacy unvaccinated people died either. may turn study makes sense data (like vaccination % people study, maybe unvaccinated younger, etc.) don‚Äôt yet neither experts.

So feels like way make sense study Reddit accounts people ptown random speculation see thread. scientific frustratingly, it‚Äôs better info we‚Äôre getting CDC public health experts. great. BIG lol voters. Probably true. Fewer republicans deep south it‚Äôs running rampant likely vaccinated. still get sick, infect someone else well. Similar Illinois.

6.4 million fully vaccinated, 644 breakthrough infections resulted hospitalization. Good VA. places entirely different experience political, basic science  Shithole states shitholes. Chief Executive Doug McMillon said retailer's ***corporate workers managers*** must vaccinated, according memo obtained CNBC.

How, exactly, help? like 1.6 million people work Walmart? clearly mis-understood. didnt get tested November 2019 tests exist. Ive gotten 3 pcr 1 antigen since. reduces chance infected symptomatic 60 90% (depending study). 

Reducing symptoms decreases chance transmitting virus daughter. 100% like previously thought, still lot better nothing. 

Also, vaccines also reduces recovery time get sick. booster increase immunity, understand want get shot increase protection daughter? India second highest daily cases reported 41K today; that's incidence rate 3.2 new cases per 100K...

In USA, talking incidence rate 60.37 per 100K today (195K new cases). That's obscenely high... People 18 times likely get covid-19 July 31st 2021 USA people India. experts certainly agree

That‚Äôs case things related pandemic. defer CDC Guidelines. Currently, CDC Guidelines got J&amp;J, fully vaccinated, seek another dose vaccine.

The study linked small study isn‚Äôt peer reviewed either case. Yawn lol. Lol probably. bigger lol im downvoted. sub ridiculous sometimes. think disconnect vaccinated still significantly less likely infected unvaccinated. 

If case, make difference. Provincetown break like 70% fully vaxxed.

About link, sniffles fully vaxxed last month would get tested? wouldn't. data bad. Garbage in, garbage out.

The vaccines work way think populations. already talking differently. shame stupid medical profession writ large be. Thank clarification, dumb self read Bear Week thought, ""Like Shark Week bears???"" Agreed. Hopefully pull agreeing decisions needlessly killed lot people, since kill *most* people, means actually good decisions? Jack's complete lack surprise 12-year old got vaccine already, honestly, could made pass 16, would get vaccine earlier. risk tolerance may higher average, see vaccines may directly protect kids harm caused virus, reduce chance spreading community, provide peace mind it‚Äôs done. things worth taking small risks for. gonna real fun either variant higher death rate next pandemic rolls around states laws books prevent reacting public health crisis. broad portions population who've done everything power learn basic techniques protect families' health. basically ensuring there's way US able react time contain new pandemic.

Thanks proving point. want say? like guidance. Half people agreeing also complaining cdc keeps changing guidance. something stay place future years come. Wear mask area goes wave future. Nice rural comment :)   Except new variant appears spreadable, breakthrough numbers still air.

I completely agree schools mandatory vaccinations. FDA months get approved schools started, sure wasn‚Äôt case. Treating people like they're stupid glazing inconvenient truths erodes public trust. gone, CDC much harder time convincing people (even pro-science) follow directives. 

This second time CDC obfuscated truth. first downplayed importance masks; credibility yet recover misjudgment. Since can‚Äôt eradicate else do? severely ill worse common flu, seems achievable high vaccination rate areas, can‚Äôt simply lock forever it‚Äôs detrimental economy. accept people going get going end hospitalized possibly die. idea get rate sustainable minimum. mean areas, like around 70% vaccinated. breakthrough cases largely mild really isn‚Äôt reason open.

I think things scaled back FDA approval vaccines young groups happens see reason restrict stuff. Probably not. union member getting negotiations closed affect negotiations.

Sad numbers could‚Äôve kept low politics didn‚Äôt get involved 1) CFR delta much lower variants

Case fatality rate delta UK lower previous variants, that's true. that's due vaccination campaign rather biology delta. Prior variants went wholly unvaccinated population including elderly. elderly largely vaccinated, delta infections found younger unvaccinated people, they've better outcomes older/sicker people. 

It's misleading say CFR lower, suggests delta less harmful much substantiated. Lol want newborn getting Covid flu. There's also issues dying. fed line reasoning. deflecting situation that's happening going back something happened beginning pandemic. study CDC used unconfirmed issues need straightened first.

No, use provide 95% immunity. don‚Äôt. Let‚Äôs pretend things haven‚Äôt changed/gotten worse. think signaling way is. People starting mask anyway spots technically red. nice guideline people start looking get back normal downswing wave month two. saying masks 10/100,000 cases may saying masks forever assumption going away.

The cdc doesn‚Äôt want change guidance universal masking reverse course yet things improve.

Every attendee forced quarantine. I'd agree except delta variant proven problematic even young kids.

I 7-year old believe understand social implications, considering we've gone long far, could limit in-person schooling months vaccine approved children well? like see end tunnel. need little patience. sad, U.S this, majority Americans care hear it. Delta change this.    Yeah, running totals change. Delta started taking off.

And that's neglecting bad testing guidance Well actually took time read study CDC, realize accounted breakthrough infections. Back rent starting April 2020 due March 1st 2022. almost 2 years pay backrent.

source? Depends province. Ontario cautious re-opening Alberta wide open. 

Where live (Alberta), zero restrictions later August longer require isolation positive cases. also slowing testing close August 18. 

People generally trust vaccines. Alberta, conservative province, 75% people 12+ one dose 65% two doses Yeah don‚Äôt know people act like democrats gods greatest gift humanity.   cannot, ever, stop people could cause harm.

TL;DR: science sound, whether choose believe not... completely opposite Israel then? Got source claim, making daring others prove you? work school system saw ways. kids really thrived. tanked. one running analyzing STAR 360 (like MAP) scores saw loses math reading, especially 4-5 grade. kids made growth expected.

Meaning, there's one answer. heart matter news media's focus breakthrough  
infections, CDC said rare. instances, poorly  
framed headlines cable news chyrons wrongly suggested  
vaccinated Americans likely spread disease  
unvaccinated Americans. quite case. Vaccinated  
Americans still far lower chance becoming infected  
coronavirus and, thus, responsible far less spread  
disease.

Something people lost sight past couple days. People reacting alarmist headlines instead actually reading information. it? seen places Delta surged: India, UK, Netherlands. fast high peak almost fast going well YeAh VaCcinE SaFE!? thinking. tried looking online ppl work thought different. planned getting booster I've heard typical scenario. Guns kill people, schools kill people.
Did get right? yet... arguing think arguing. said ""X"" document mean ""X"" human right. implying use ""unapproved"" vaccines discouraged document somewhere, would agree fine? implying since _not_ appear, therefore _must_ human right? use two examples, freedom slavery freedom sexual identity mentioned human rights. Thus logic... _not_ be? ü§î There's lot free-time activities demand negative test else can't them, they'll probably either test vaccinate  so? Young school-age kids eligible vaccines yet. would offering in-person schooling good idea opposed offering choice?  begins :-) soon fees everything covid related standard everywhere Same. Oh dear god that? Thanks sharing. gallows humor take humor.

Something needed.

Stuck head tho... today vaccine mandate customers difficult governments would rather force everyone homes instead testing, contact tracing, quarantining. Almost every country stuck testing tracing come top COVID. Eli5 works? expressing *political opinion* enough science done justify implementation policy. He's entitled opinion citizen is.

As scientist though, offers plan recommendation science done, bypasses urgent question policies implemented meantime *given* data yet collected, address real-world concern collecting data insists necessary would require let people control groups die solely count them.

The irony saying need fewer pundits scientists actually made laugh. video 100% punditry 0% science. dumpster fire. guess want kids isolated THIRD school year I'm literally murderer. Nevermind studies showing safe, they're clearly wrong. Rogan misinformed, one worst podcasts seen.    Fake ones people allergic authorized classes vaccines? 50% entire country vaccinated something would consider ""hardly vaccinated"" thought Singapore pretty line original Pfizer protocol? know much extended by? thought maybe 4 weeks align moderna? Goddamn hope so! yeah can't try majoritarian strategies ""individual protection"" less nothing situation, covid zero bust. One thing wonder unvaccinated people end handling Delta fairly easily might asymptomatic infection last year even know about. would helped body fight Delta effectively virus longer ""novel"".  They're interested facts, critical thinking, checking sources information. kind things known years, like study analysis indicated Sao2 level, sensor type, skin color, gender predictive errors Spo2 estimates low Sao2 levels. data suggest clinically important bias considered monitoring patients saturations 80%, especially darkly pigmented skin; study needed confirm observations relevant populations.

Dark skin decreases accuracy pulse oximeters low oxygen saturation: effects oximeter probe type medical field weird notions minorities, even among new medical students... comment thread really healthy echo chamber.  Exact one I'm obviously suggesting lie anyone ""massage"" statistics. misleading cite percent vaccinated people infected without also citing vaccination rate among population.

I think pretty obvious vaccines quite effective Delta variant previously believed, provide good protection. nitpick ""very effective"" means terms numbers, simple fact vaccine greatly reduces chance 1) catching COVID begin with; 2) severe symptoms catch it.

Maybe research see COVID hospitalizations *extremely* rare among vaccinated. one hospitalization rate among fully vaccinated people COVID-19 ranged effectively zero (0.00%) California, Delaware, D.C., Indiana, New Jersey, New Mexico, Vermont, Virginia 0.06% Arkansas. (Note: Hospitalization may may due rates death among fully vaccinated people COVID-19 even lower, effectively zero (0.00%) two reporting states, Arkansas Michigan 0.01%. (Note: Deaths may may due Almost (more 9 10) COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, deaths occurred among people unvaccinated yet fully vaccinated, states reporting breakthrough data.

You're spreading misinformation, plain simple. vaccines work extremely effective. always tell people. Listen, 300 million vaccinated world. long term effect, world would doomed anyways 1/3 population would wiped out. morons tend outside major cities, typically reasonable. example, mayors Orlando Miami recently reinstated form mask mandate despite governor threatening throw temper tantrum. 

The problem state big. People Tallahassee, relatively unscathed COVID, making decisions people Miami, COVID epicenter. cities nearly 500 miles apart.   buy way Uni, can't buy grades easily. Yes, great see reasonable companies standing values allowing employees refuse wear required PPE site. Yes, 1/25 likely, used 1 23 chance. means 1 575 infections, about, end hospitalized. People living sweet government checks. people would killed Jesus spot despite claiming followers. CDC blaming kids? Arizona?  Sorry dear. estimate average deaths per day US New Year's Day 2022? dumbass governor 50% problem. charge manslaughter. Fucking twat wants nation's leader. Lol remember George Carlin said- ""Imagine stupid average person is- realize half stupider that"" leaked internalndocument said 1/25th delta. March delta. Thanks! 

‚ÄúA major worry right Delta, highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 virus strain, first identified India December. swept rapidly country Great Britain reaching U.S., dominant variant. ‚Äú sadly perfect example badly CDC rolled recent recommendations. Even pro vaxx people spouting antivaxx rhetoric. literally led fewer deaths better economy/big surplus. 

The problem. reality according twisted beliefs trying deny reality instead reevaluating beliefs. might really breaks spirit healthcare workers Herculean work past year half; Nearly people admitting ICU COVID opportunity get vaccine passed. Looking Target now. Surprised Walmart beat chase this. Whelp. awesome response ever. respect much. Thank you. wish could like this. begs differ unvaccinated people coddling -- whether bloggers YouTubers folks media even elected office. share blame.  begs differ greatly reduce likelihood vaxxed person spread covid

The new requirement vaxxed wear masks precisely saying incorrect.

Vaxxed people still spread get covid. catastrophic failure vaccine bridge discredit successful vaccines. Good! What's average age Lollapalooza attendee? I'd expect hospitalization even unvaxxed. Here's information have

What want say? simply wrong saying people think I'm poor pay 20k extra time visit another country? vaccinated. Anyone get vaccinated selfish moron.

I think lie them. reduce chances bad outcomes LOT, think counter-productive lie efficacy. give ammunition stupid anti-vacxers. point, ALL. FOR. STICKS. one caveat ... also must address actual obstacles access, as:

- Access workers whose employers refuse permit time getting jabs and/or recovery side effects. (Poke employers stick.)

- Access housebound.

- Access folks remote areas, suburban/urban areas access requires extensive travel point hardship. New info shows vaccinated people get covid spread even sick. I'd rather play safe friend's little kids since interact fairly regularly. School starts month anyway. We'll see happens then. point, I'm really afraid getting covid personal health, want pass vaccinated like myself. understand.

But least keep mind Information changes comes possibility adjust accordingly, especially ongoing pandemic variants emerging. wish simple ‚Äúwe know everything there‚Äôs nothing left anticipate, guidelines won‚Äôt change.‚Äù

That's matters That's populations makeup though. example, vaccinated side way elderly people proportionately (which likely), higher hospitalization conclusively comparison vaccination status.  make impact, think outrageous moderators locking certain threads 'political.' issue we're facing Covid become political one, benefits one pretend otherwise. Username checks out. Get vaccinated. Grow pair. live life. Or, know, meanwhile could also half-dozen things also help, like masking, instead forbidding them? would leave Canada, clear customs fine attached names?

Customs officer: ""Have anything declare?"" 
Americans: ""Nothing"" 50% what, week ago? entire US jumped 50% time period. Ah, thankfully I'm extroverted also extremely neurotic time, balance completely inaccurate. 

Vaccines greatly reduce likelihood vaxxed person spread covid. eliminate completely.  seen Israel's numbers? necessary. wish! would like free college plus paying back everybody actually paid college loans. never gone restaurant? never eaten something grocery store?

And yoy keep ignoring everything else I'm saying (because answer). drive? punch someone possibility consequences? fredom endager others think have. Call hyperbole, let's pretend people treating rise cases among vaccinated like March 2020 clearly isn't. CDC committed grave error connecting lifting restrictions vaccination rates instead choosing rescind haphazard way. lost sight fact getting herd immunity always going take least 70% vaccinated state country reached number; CDC needs actually focus raising vaccination rates instead whatever else they've clearly working.

The CDC one public health agencies come admitted COVID going away that

 1. NEED high vaccination rates lessen impact 

2. COVID endemic mean can't get back normalcy astoundingly dense. correct, boss sets tone/mood company ultimately. People follow leader, whether leadership deserved clearly another conversation. [That really got hand tax assholes yet what? Wow smart idea. Put passion position cannot legally verify third dose *actually* need get one. 


Not hogging vaccines unethical counterproductive, even clear necessary yet. Hi friend, seeing covid less deadly children flu would concerned social educational stunting due covid assume due province Canadian. wonder delta seems less threat Canada due rapid recent mass vaccination been. Due limited initial supply, people Canada finished second dose past 2 months, US peak vaccination surge winding April. possible vaccines highly effective Delta freshly vaccinated still high circulating antibodies, less fade. Yeah every guy loves drinking bars hitting anything moves. 

They need life. Aside Chinese military, Walmart largest employer earth. Still even reduced efficacy asymptomatic transmission that‚Äôs still cutting 70% hosts population fully vaccinated. great deal slow spread. Similarly appears it‚Äôs still 90% effective symptomatic disease. vaccines less effective preventing infection delta original covid strain, still effective see greatly reduced covid rates vaccinated areas vs. unvaccinated. P-town outbreak got control rather quickly compared south Midwest largely unvaccinated sustained outbreaks. get rid cases entirely we‚Äôd need well 90% population vaccinated don‚Äôt think ever happen. either wear masks stay inside rest lives learn live virus protection vaccine provides us.

I also looked recent case numbers Singapore looks like outbreak you‚Äôre small compared earlier 2020 outbreaks. also seems like Singapore‚Äôs standards ‚Äúlarge outbreak‚Äù lot higher USA‚Äôs lol. guys 2 infections per 100k people day, good gets here. like 8-10 per 100k state (2nd highly vaccinated state) 200 per 100k per day hardest-hit unvaccinated areas right now. We've sent people moon still use forgeable paper currency. solution crypto Thanks. Fully vaccinated here. gonna wear mask. didn‚Äôt get vaccinated.. that‚Äôs you.

Yeah, that‚Äôs right, European pharmaceutical companies make profits United States, is. Exactly. Good luck reimposing full blown mask mandate. Remember CDC said masks necessary vaccinated individuals almost retailers responded within 24-48 hours dropping mask mandates? Look response recent updated guidance. Many retailers ongoing ""emergency meetings"" blowback they'll likely face reverse course.  check Florida Coronavirus sub. Lota data posted there. 

I hate living here.   shit advertised ‚Äújust fine‚Äù like 3 weeks ago. seems like vaccinated much responsible spread virus creation new variants non-vaccinated point.

""Vaccination alone stop rise new variants fact could push evolution strains evade protection, researchers warned Friday."" Hope family move Yes. Science disregarded results disagree think results be.  Australia get vaccinated age group recently. AZ get special medical exception get young. advice access changed last month. 

So young problem! anything problem old politicians order enough Pfizer older Australians vaccinated wanting open things they're safe!  seems like statistical numbers, instead anything actually scientific(with statistics statistics, actual proof anything) Yeah never chicken pox kid grew prior vaccine ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Delta variant may cause severe disease Alpha ancestral strains: Published evidence

That‚Äôs I‚Äôm saying!!! many state plates FL NY, NJ, MA, would vacation August? Dumb dumb dumb People keep forgetting long Covid Thank half population (those fully vaxxed) responsible 20% cases, vaccine better 50% preventing infection.

How getting number? I'm calculating efficacy correctly, think math off. using [the formula vaccine 54% population accounts 20% cases, efficacy works 80% efficacy:

* LA County 2,553 cases per day average; 1 5 (510.6 cases) vaccinated individuals, 4 5 (2,042.4 cases) unvaccinated people.

* 54% county fully vaccinated. 2019 estimated population LA County shade 10 million; therefore 5.4 million fully vaccinated, 4.6 million either unvaccinated one dose.

Using relative risk formula: 

* 510.6 breakthrough cases/5.4 million vaccinated people = 0.00009456 

* 2,042.4 unvaccinated cases/4.6 million people fully vaccinated = .00044391

* Efficacy = 1 - (.00009456/.00044391) * 100% = **78.7% efficacy** study doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúsay opposite,‚Äù study indicated bubbles testing, students weren‚Äôt likely major source spread, partly didn‚Äôt seem efficiently spread family members even caught school, partly bubbles testing helped break transmission chains.

That‚Äôs ‚Äúthe opposite‚Äù all. Also: study conducted delta don‚Äôt data things might change. still think number people taking upon get boosters small. Hopefully delta variant enough wake jackasses up. right, seen stupid belief going around. let reword comment. 

It true vaccinated people dying, think simply ignore 500 unvaxxed deaths per day. appetite lockdowns, keeping kids school, avoiding friends anymore. However, think first comment dismissing new cases per day meaningless vaxxed die appropriate. nothing else, unvaxxed need reminded personal risk doubling every couple weeks. I'm saying would lie, could pull whole HIPPA thing, point mandatory, tell Disney none business.

Personally, think good idea wear masks indoors US right now, except maybe indoor dining. places need restrictions right unless local hospitals close capacity. mandatory.

You somehow need balance public interests. believe nobody forced vaccinated. image alone forcibly injecting someone something simply intolerable, especially Germany.

But time public interest kept mind. option found safe due diligence expected. free it'll allow take part public life. choose take option, detriment health around you, face restrictions protect others. Society obligation allow full control body, obligation guarantee full access public life.

These tests quite expensive. Testing every second day, far unreasonable number, costs roughly much welfare benefits adult. testing. unlike welfare, need tested survive. 

You end situation anytime want meantime access public life, bear cost. may like like pay cost, cost cost ignorance. cause cost, responsibility. society's responsibility. Seems like you‚Äôre grasping straws here‚Ä¶the vaccine spreading like wildfire throughout nation. Masking needed. Maybe cancelling large events too. essentially using numbers‚Ä¶ 48.8 vs 50 basically depend source use. CDC states don‚Äôt even agree within margin.

For delta, two doses counts. Single dose efficacy ~30% (from 90% alpha).

48.8% vs 57% 17% difference. huge. Tell American without saying American. Protip: trim nails. trying analyze trends may involve human behaviors.

Fine hospital deciding treat people, fine analyzing trends vaccine hesitancy I'm American, hate market based healthcare system revolves around insurance pay for.

That said, might well make work us that's system have. Insurances companies would LOVE start denying coverage uncaxxed people, think let them. Medicare insurance companies already patients discharge hospital AMA. assholes continue assholes. Got it. Meanwhile US pays people vaccinated yet. thats exactly point. Tests save even save vaccine. knowledge people vaccinated still infect people. people tested negatively infect people ? Doubt Yes, according Israeli data, want completely avoid infection/long-haul.

No, care getting hospitalized dying. Edit. ""Should"" never lockdown Florida. wild plague west day one. next months interesting.

I pictured hundreds hunters walking line forest hunt bears.. headlines misleading. It‚Äôs vaccinated people break infections. last pet pretty important. 

You still less likely spreading virus vaccinated. less likely get infected. mention much lower risk severe disease.  Long haul symptoms joke, plus know whether virus may mutate something lethal. Again, tired virus too, need stop spread. easy say, ""I'm going live life, I'm vaccinated!"" get breakthrough infection get long haul symptoms like ""Wish took precautions"". Maybe feel need don't. limit personal concern? worried possibility, unknown, worried proven yet. That's valid concern entitled without significant evidence support reality see argument imposing restrictions others concern. Vaccination rate per age group:

**60+ years**  
at least one time: 85,1 % (some J&amp;J vaccinations included)  
completely: 79,1 %  

**18 - 59 years**  
at least one time: 61,7 % (some J&amp;J vaccinations included)  
completely: 51,7 %  
 
**12 - 17 years**  
at least one time: 19,7 %  
completely: 9,3 %   

The official vaccination commission recommending far vaccination 12 - 15 years old. might slow vaccinations age group younger teens also get vaccinated pediatrician recently also bit complicated. Nowadays special times vaccination centers though. 

First time vaccinations overall gone lot last weeks. really doubt 18 - 59 years old age group get 80 % vaccinated like older people getting forced bit. 

At least clear majority adults gotten vaccinated least one time. think political parties still afraid announce harder measures non vaccinated people next election.  reflected graph posted state website? detailed rebuttal everything laid out, response is:

What? test protect virus. test tells infected not. (Even then, perfect--false positives, knowledge people vaccinated still infect people.

True. vaccine perfect. vaccine perfect. they're extremely effective preventing infection. upon infection, they're extremely likely prevent hospitalization people tested negatively infect people ? Doubt it

False negatives exist, even rare. Either way, even someone unvaccinated tests negative, accurate reading, still prone infection spread eventually since Delta keeps ramping up. mention variants keep mutating unvaccinated people spreading them.

Right now, unvaccinated, probably going end getting infected. infection rate Delta double infection rate original virus. IIRC, someone infected spread virus least 5 people. That's huge rate spread. source that? That's recent data I've seen vaccines zero effectiveness large portion population refuses take them, can't take approved 12. Furthermore, best vaccine 95% effective, meaning 20 times less likely infected exposed, however Delta variant maybe 3 times infectious original, safety factor 7. put room full unvaccinated, infected people, nobody wearing mask including you, voila, stacked odds favor virus.

TL;DR: vaccines prevent neither infection death, reduce risk. work unvaccinated.

I'm good. need anyone's luck...you though chose dependants nuts. .08% vaccinated people. bullshit media Rt measures fast cases increasing. infected person infects 10 people Rt 10. without looking raw number cases Rt meaningful. Rt 1 going cause increase cases. So, 66 Floridians test positive today Florida Rt 1.41, infect 92 people total 158 cases. 20 Californians test positive today, Rt 1.74 adds 39 cases 59 total. 

Obviously neither situation ideal, would argue Florida worse spot since numbers already high mitigations would less effective. 

Also, Rt drops quickly virus burns new hosts spread to. likely accounts Florida's Rt dropping. California may never get peak Florida depending mitigations vaccines.  consolation, think would happened vaccinated?

Perhaps same. cannot know that. might also vaccine turns effective would expect be.

Also sucks wearing facial hair. Working mask absolutely blows. hate able read facial expressions. around uncomfortable IMO often worn wrong anyways.

It‚Äôs stupid restriction. want wear mask, fine. I‚Äôm vaxxed don‚Äôt make wear one. think data ""downplays"" seriousness covid/delta/our current situation popular here.  always something ""wait see"" takes three years wipe virus they'll wait then. Basically keep making shit vaccine longer necessary pat back nothing. I'm Missouri expect whole state likely peek Mid-August.

But see school starting right Crap one told supposed goats month case, population 70% vaccinated 75% hospitalizations vaccinated, NEGATIVE efficacy. 

The sample size waaay low matter, though. county monitors this. get rough idea  cases area go people start getting tested. I'll honest, fine coexisting Covid. want get severely ill get someone else severely ill. won‚Äôt be. Really? find reaffirming, glad know vaccines indeed working well. Hopefully eligible un-vaccinated people hurry get shot get way. We're getting ahead pandemic 70% population vaccinated, even means population thinned out, we'll get sooner later. institute safety measures like mask mandates. glad left pit Arkansas. coverage among eligible Massachusetts residents 69%. Approximately three quarters (346; 74%) cases occurred fully vaccinated persons (those completed 2-dose course mRNA vaccine

This similar data coming Israel day. fraction cases almost exactly matched fraction people vaccinated. interpret mean vaccines little nothing prevent getting infected covid. Maybe interpretation missing.

The important question, obviously symptomatology differed vaccinated unvaccinated cases. people masking? NPIs masking explicitely ruled out; indeed almost opposite. comments make appear CDC clearly proposing concrete plan involving masking. plan put forward document. I'm 100% sure intentions stellar, misrepresenting text, quote put incorrect context, inference afterwards. People actually look document get incorrect understanding conclusions. here. Hang friend. I‚Äôm depressed kids masked separated normal activities. Local News commenters dumbest dumb.  thought long before...but American way divide....,fucking dumbasses like you. mean, kind goes back said sample size small, told wrong :)

It's good, opinion matters extremely reassuring. Massachusetts barely cases per capita compared places like Florida.

If 100% hospitalized patients vaccinated, one, I'd ecstatic.  post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Still working home gone couple events, including small birthday get together last weekend somebody later tested positive. week later tested positive. I‚Äôve laying around house feeling like crap, smell taste. vaccine didn‚Äôt protect like thought would. I‚Äôm starting see stories case. vaccine effective delta variant advertised. trying scare anyone, realistic. They'll problem vaccinating vast majority rural population, ask live close proximity major transport links inactivated vaccines China using need specialized cold chain infrastructure. 

My uncle lives village Shanxi, one poorest China's interior, yet he's second shot months ago. remember briefly living house 80s even indoor plumbing, he's got wifi house. 

If anything might uppity Chinese urbanites get shot holding waiting Biontech mRNA get approved might slow vaccination drive. think rural folks likely willing line get shots local health officials come calling. Correct. That‚Äôs saying adjustment increasing positivity rate. Timeline? Well, timeline free care traveling. would able differentiate antibodies came from? think Ig tests capability. Unfortunately figure new vaccine boosters needed vaccine going relieve health system stop transmission - meaning either need ramp testing wait see virus decides stop mutating‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm depressed honestly. June glorious July completely turned around. notice leaving part vaccinated people much smaller chance contracting covid first place. Same! coronavirus less deadly there? sure anything with. 24M infections 66k deaths seasonal flu territory 26 years Conservative media like Fox Limbaugh followed Trump, Kellyanne Conway etc taught lot people believe whatever ""alternative facts"" want to.

It‚Äôs good question, honestly think making penalty forgery severe would lot good. ""Are excited get life saving vaccine?"" ""No, two weeks get $20 scratcher get second shot, got going me.""

I'm paraphrasing. friend ask tell effects vaccine. 
I explained later (after initially refused offer get early opportunity get jab) real effects would be.
If get vaccinated, could potentially DIE sure hell would never see again. 
She fully vaccinated - glad count win converts! Mass. like 70 % + vaccinated? something like 87% male? mostly gay type event I'm mistaken. that's perfectly ok anyone thinks otherwise. people vaxxed, breakthroughs we're gonna have. That's expected. seems like major party type event people close together prolonged periods time. Add vast amounts alcohol inhibitions disappear. Tons viral RNA thrown around. Wonder viral doses overwhelming inmate immune system kick time. mention, alcohol dampens immune system anyway. immunocompromised individuals well. 6% HIV positive. might mean anything though. think boils massive viral dose duration exposure. That's probably sustainable spikes going Florida, Alabama, Louisiana, etc. getting downvoted? What's CFR delta variant cases looking like compared variants it? data unvaccinated CFR two? agree. also need close borders state travelers. many people NY, NJ right it‚Äôs crazy. Stay home safe lives! It‚Äôs amazing anti freedom alt leftist sub are. Smh us favor make August 4th well said. Remember COVID deniers pointing Florida major success? Wonder right now.

Get vaccines, people. Death rate much higher Covid flu (approx 18 5). dont let facts get way berating people wanting kids stay alive healthy. definitely good way prevent infection. Certainly significantly effective vaccinated. Delta may result breakthrough cases fully vaxxed people still way less likely infected. honestly hate people's reactions mention climate change.  ""Oh weather years, natural cycle earth""..... mean, ok, people reducing emissions? Maybe cleaner air breath, cleaner water drink, fresher water swim in. mean, there's really downside reducing emissions/ pollution.  Yes, takes money, jobs lost pretro-chemical industry, perfect.

Especially since mask mandates coming back lot fingers pointed big part cause. Good luck, stay safe. would guess organ damage long term effects really unlikely immune system already primed pretty well fight disease -- especially since getting better already. go nicely AstraZeneca Moderna shots. full set end year. low numbers could fluke number health experts saying shows vaccine worked bc vaxxed hospitalized none died (when fewer unvaxxed hospitalized unvaxxed died) concerns me.

Well no.

Efficacy rate vaccinated compared unvaccinated. 

It hospitalization rate vaccinated people.

Here, 70% population vaccinated, 75% hospitalizations. 

The sample (4 total hospitalizations) far small determine efficacy, tiny sample, efficacy would negatives (as in, vaccines made likely hospitalized, obviously nonsense). Hopefully help least some, types stories comments turned tend filled comments like ""fake post!"" ""this lie!"" crap. really makes lose faith humanity. Hey seriously you‚Äôre going get this! We‚Äôre together least. know hard things seem depressing, made 2020 you‚Äôve got 2021. vigilant safety precautions, N95 masks bees knees, strong, you‚Äôve definitely got this!!! üí™üèª effective mask mandates? would argue potentially effective seatbelt laws. 

You don‚Äôt need make arguments. enormous amount data last year showing public health outcomes areas kept mask mandates away them, results probably surprising (no correlation) Yep! like flu shot - prevent infection necessarily, meant massively eliminate lethality significantly reduce highly severe symptoms. gets point‚Ä¶ antivaxxers ruining everything us. They‚Äôre literally biological weapons. 70%+ inoculation yes, pandemic vaccinated.

I know anyone thinks 70% kind important threshold, especially virulent Delta variant. Mostly read 90 95% needed drive cases meaningful way.

More importantly:

* starting see vaccinated people rather freely get transmit virus (that is, vaccines sterilizing), though apparently symptoms greatly reduced, good. obvious means comes cutting case rates. Breakthrough infections still cases.

* Coronavirus vaccines lose effectiveness somewhere six months eighteen months out, trying achieve particular vaccination threshold going require constant effort, something complete one day. Obviously, much harder context global population.

My guess going find need strategies vaccines get back kind low level cases. US least, seem anyone's radar, gone all-in vaccine idea.  sentenced life prison without possibility parole. can't Florida, governor made illegal. He's Disney's pocket though, hopefully they'll put pressure reverse it. made bad? ""It's Democratic hoax folks!""...and that's took. get shots Pfizer Moderna vaccines, would better shots one vaccine alone?

Or combination two vaccines big three (Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J).

I literally physical today wish I'd thought ask doc time, publicly reveal ignorance things work. Yes, like said vaccine came vaccine fix problems, need read thought otherwise. GM virus following genetic models regarding mutation types, mutation rates, etc naturally occurring. Never virus ever mutated fast progressively virulent strains within single season entirely new animal never previously seen nature. currenty believe Delta+ strain evade vaccines knows happen that. gentically modified virus telling thing previously uncharted waters. hope keep putting information hope people start reading reputable peer reviewed medical journals get facts order keep us safe. ‚ÄúVaccines don‚Äôt prevent catching COVID‚Äù nonsense.  one Pfizer first dose Moderna second.  (Ontario, Canada). eagerly awaiting data method provides better protection compared 2 doses one manufacturer. They're imagining quick, convenient death; getting shot head etc Well makes ya sleep better night neighbor got moderna vaccine died covid 2 weeks ago. nobody fully safe. Nobody wants hear true thanks, would prefer pfizer booster. 

Developing countries sinovac, posters assured definitely inferior garbage. Since sinovac great, poor countries stick it.  definitely possible could false negative tested early. not, sometimes diseases give different symptoms may normally get. 20, got sick scratchy throat also extreme fatigue could hardly get bed. symptoms. strange. understanding. vaccinated, antibodies fight virus introduced system, would reduce viral load much virus replicates inside body. Therefore, vaccine, virus likely replicate inside one‚Äôs system bc immune system takes longer catch on, causing symptoms increasing viral load spread. Idk I‚Äôm 100 mark here, feel like I‚Äôm close. It‚Äôs viral load. vaccinated person theoretically carry smaller viral load exposed bc immune system quicker kill virus. Less viral load equal less spread. 

Vaccines magical force field shield someone getting infected something. However, vaccinated population, spread go bc bodies quicker fight off, reducing total amount viral load collectively boys PTown definitely offering meat Delta ate!!! study whether got sick died, though. mean, fact COVID implies died.

[As May 1, 2021, CDC transitioned monitoring reported vaccine breakthrough cases focus identifying investigating hospitalized fatal cases due cause. shift help maximize quality data collected cases greatest clinical public health last EUAs took like 2 weeks. I'm sure top it.

I mean, people live US already know. people outside, they'll google/Wikipedia it, suppose. time Delta maybe, could help next variant. chances need better fitting mask. Getting good fit fix that, especially around nose metal band. get tie mask leave bottom one littler looser top air goes up.

The Pfizer/Moderna/JJ vaccines tout 100% effective stopping infection yet messaging White House made seem like 100% effective.

People still catch COVID symptomatic. risk hospitalization/death significantly lower.

Realistically, current low global vaccination rate, risk catching COVID never zero. vaccines significantly reduce risk. based on? source? Yeah unfortunately statement target. Even masks requirement, difficult enforce.
I know answer is, cannot get enough vaccinated, Delta variants continue run rampant, going deep shit. beatings continue vaccinations improve. Saw post fit, 30, American South America. caught covid said like bad cold. Second time caught delta knocked around. Vaccines short supply South America. advised perhaps fly back US get vaccinated.

No.

Vaccinated people still significantly less likely get infected Delta first place. vaccinated person still significantly less likely transmit virus would get infected first.

Do think know COVID getting vaccine? 
I think anecdotal, seems rough reaction first vaccine previously sick disease. 
For me, don‚Äôt believe ever illness, first shot mildly sore arm. 
The second shot hit rather hard, quite tired / achy / horribly sore arm / headache / elevated HR second day. 
With that, I‚Äôd expect get another shot would probably fine experience anything go of! 
Then again, spread #2 &amp; #3 quite shorter. thank you! agreed - i‚Äôm glad vaccinated got covid Right Pfizer vaccine said 88% effective(symptomatic) Delta variant. Assuming people exposed got Pfizer(which already know case since admit got Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J). 10 000 people went exposed virus, means still 1200 people symptomatic breakthrough infections. yeah know many exposed people vaccinated. trying downplay significance vaccinated peoples coming disease supposedly prevented vaccine. Thank updates.  I'm curious even matters... found million two million ten million asymptomatic cases, would render vaccine useless? I'm curious changes anything, 330 million Americans vaccinated overnight found 120 million breakthrough infection within six months extraordinary testing tracking program even many 500k hospitalized (and, lets say, half pre-existing conditions)... that's still pretty damn amazing vaccine considering we're against, it? I'd take chances vaccine sure, like 'took chances' Moderna vaccine. 

I think tracking giving headlines total asymptomatic cases zero context recipe one thing - fewer people getting vaccinated, fewer people getting boosters, and, result, WAY people clogging hospitals dying future. 

This headline exactly what's wrong messaging. handful miracle vaccines less year news we're getting amplification tiny, tiny, tiny # breakthrough cases versus VAST majority people either get got symptoms. 

The goal stamp COVID completely, literally billions unvaccinated people around world, that's impossible without months total worldwide lockdowns vaccines administered. 

It's basically destined become another endemic virus get handle vaccines form treatment blunt effects infection. like flu common cold. Yep, agree still masking public well. unfortunate thing messaging going harmful effect told get vaccine, things return normal.

Third, demographics cases likely reflect attendees public gatherings, events marketed adult male participants; study underway identify population characteristics among cases, additional demographic characteristics underlying health conditions including immunocompromising conditions.""  involve leopards? well‚Ä¶

If anything, I'd enjoy news unknowingly Covid months ago, would mean (1) symptoms (2) better immunity now.

EDIT - Nevermind saw post. Half nurses get vaccinated. Satan South Park played better. think vaccines work effectiveness might diminish time. stuff we'll understand time probably.  think recent news regarding Delta transmissions vaccinated people, breakthrough cases, renewed mask mandates, making people feel like we've come full circle. many people felt like finally returning normal going places without mask, offices reopening, etc., looks like we're moving backwards. frustrating part 30-40% country simply refuses take safe, free solution vaccine. 

So deal renewed stress pandemic end sight despite weeks optimism, also constantly think many selfish assholes get vaccine they're ignorant stubborn. There's real feeling helplessness realize nearly half humanity gleefully lead us path destruction there's absolutely nothing it. We've seeing years climate change, harder ignore mask weeks clear.

The funny thing completely agree here.

And yet much sounds like media using small, extremely biased sample size extrapolate rest country.

Even fucking CDC seems using cluster dictate policy rest country. Yep.

It also means cases go 25X higher (which already happened), vaccinated people hospitalized/dead case unvaccinated people cases jumped up.

We decent end game awhile. Get vaccinated lose mask get back life. 

Now CDC sunk ship new data shows significant transmission vaccinated people plan 6 months, two years, etc?

Literally one rural state cares anymore, frankly don‚Äôt either. I‚Äôm fully immunized, CDC said removing masks fine suddenly back hole go. I‚Äôm done stuff proven otherwise. spent months song dance, wearing masks, isolating, getting vaccine finished. I‚Äôm giving family friend time. I‚Äôm giving dwindling years life this.

A significant reason study took place socially sexually charged area. 
The vaccines percent chance making 100% invulnerable virus -- make difficult get virus. However, vaccinated person get sick they're exposed high levels virus immune system already actively fighting it.  
If were, say, making infected person, virus enter body higher levels breathed little bit air infected person.

The existing sites Belgium Germany enough complete EU orders. joke? babies are, lol. Every baby different. Fecal incontinence! Bright yellow poop!! (Which completely normal babies) made day! Hilarious!  close herd immunity?

Hopefully yes, are. 

Look happened UK. scientific background take grain salt, purely mathematically speaking, looks much like herd immunity, lost it, again. 

It's commonly theorized herd immunity covid pre-Delta may somewhere around 70%. vaccination natural infection, UK almost surely hovering around number April/May. new surge started June, ~4-5 week climb peak, probably roughly 8% country caught covid (around 1.3 million infections logged time, commonly estimated developed nations 1 4 5 actual covid infections tested logged, giving 5+ million ""true"" infections). also fully vaccinated another 1% population time. roughly speaking, time Delta surging UK, went something like 10% population immunity. cases absolutely nosediving (almost 50% single week) zero intervention restrictions anything.

To me, looks LOT like Delta variant requires ~10% herd immunity. think likely Florida (and rest country) fact hit herd immunity, Delta simply came moved equation, sit around wait knock another 10% population. Florida probably little different travel snowbirds everything cycling out, I'm willing bet inside 2 weeks way even nothing. are, fact, close herd immunity. hope.  whole article doesn‚Äôt mention cases crossing border Texas single time. going pretend isn‚Äôt happening? infrastructure behind EU level, right it‚Äôs individual countries use it, not. works Denmark need green CoronaPas go indoor bar, resturents, gyms etc. get green pad vaccination, recent test previous infection.  I'm statistician, think fortune teller realistically speculate thing. believe number contingent upon many variables solid conclusion. vaccination rates continue decline? people readjust behavior way limits spread? another varian, perhaps severe variantt? Along vaccines, could discover therapeutic treatment options covid? hospitals overburdened, almost certainly impact covid non-covid deaths.

I would assume lucky see even severe variant evades vaccine efficacy, vaccinated population mostly fine. vaccines ***highly*** successful, even slight decline efficacy Delta. Per CDC statistics vaccinated population around 3 hospitalizations 1 death per 100,000 people. understanding, lot vaccinated people succumb covid hospitalized typically preexisting health concerns, like immunocompromised. biggest fear promising outlook could dashed pieces new variant.

It would surprise see startling amount deaths amongst unvaccinated. hospitals nearing capacity, know things looking good, we've even began deal colder months holidays. come via Narita Haneda. locals work events. one densely packed cities planet. take much things spread like wildfire. Sadly, downvoted comment removed ""antivax."" both. Welcome reality. OP, but-- healthcare system already huge disgrace. low vaccination rate, inviting competitors coaches countries received single dose. clear May games canceled Thats enough. vaccinated must also contact unvaccinated.

Train Busan zombie strain started deer. still know care virus spreading causing death/severe illness requires hospitalization. Maybe, probably not. Keep weather eye government corporations digging ever personal life.  That‚Äôs true, many it, many exposed simply don‚Äôt get it, get symptoms.

Fitter, happier, productive.  people leading antimask antivax groups community predominantly woman would describe ""Karens."" Already happening cyprus UK spaced dosing 12 weeks good results.

Plus COVID endemic, everyone going exposed eventually, masks not. therapist described ""compassion fatigue,"" think apt description. cared well-being even care mine. Now, fucks left give. read projection virus allowed spread among unvaccinated vaccinated, continue mutate vaccine resistant strains. Therefore, need continue non-pharmaceutical interventions avoid scenario. bars packed early April went masks seen anywhere. never Austin much except go huge bars.   Depending current wave goes, memory cell immunity may good enough people. memory cell immunity 4 circulating corona viruses time we‚Äôre years old, give us mild colds adults. expect one going settle pattern eventually.

Unless unvaccinated plan spend good amount time close unmasked conversation indoors deer, worried. quite true.

Considering 70,000 Americans testing positive per day, panic vaccinated person because? China gave world playbook March 2020 end pandemic 2 months less. Yet couldn‚Äôt get done. Australia New Zealand China continually kicking covid ass despite occasional rare flare ups. Austin early April couple weeks second shot. wall wall people stuff bar bar. Never seen many bars life one city. It‚Äôs rehashing Trump‚Äôs strategy deflecting blame China finding scapegoat anything keep people dying. Wow, don‚Äôt understand votes here! live country pollen levels high wear masks. got N95 masks year made incredible difference. Best thing ever. Wearing masks distancing made huge differences community - flu pneumonias almost non-existent (I‚Äôm Canada). 

Personally, Flu season, go public transit cities wear N95. Whenever go clinic, see doctor go hospital wear mask. absolutely wear mask going someplace chance getting cold high. not? 

Your mom right. mentioned wife immune compromised glad hear taking care family. Yeah,Everyone got check up,especially vaccinated,makes safer hospitals. Same. heart really goes nurses doctors whose patients refused accept covid till last breath.  Mask annoyance level:

* store: 10%
* public transit: 15%
* day work: 40%
* social events: 100%

That last one big one. Masking totally ruins gatherings whole point share laughs smiles people communicate deep emotional level. lot nightclubs concert halls theaters close mandates one wants things wearing mask, fun.

I feel like proponents mask mandates older folks house family settled life, anti-social types like going out. think purely functional perspective like, ""I still *do* everything need wearing mask, accomplish tasks support myself, fine.""

But younger extroverts trying make friends find love create meaningful human experiences, makes everything feel sad empty. Like we're surviving instead living. know, I've wondering Florida. Covid still finding tens thousands people infect every day. Given 5x 10x theories number vaccinated seems strange Herd Immunity reached.

I sort wonder asymptomatic vanilla-covid people catching Delta. Thoughts? Paywall  That‚Äôs normal poop babies get team scientists investigate means? would unlikely. hope Abbott able hang office. None would possible without commitment killing Texans. ""new deadly side effects"" rare disease still much much worse.

It choose want take risk. That's lottery want participate in, even though chances might low. Yes do. believe invading army attacking ones village - even members village terrified war fighting need protect community part social contract rather nothing letting others make sacrifices still demanding community benefits.

A virus spread kindof thing take life let live approach whether people want protect community. shocked! Not. ‚ÄúAs July 28, 43.5% Texas‚Äô 29 million people fully vaccinated.‚Äù 

‚ÄúOf 8,787 people died Texas due COVID-19 since early February, least 43 fully vaccinated, Texas Department State Health Services said.

That means 99.5% people died due COVID-19 Texas Feb. 8 July 14 unvaccinated, 0.5% result ‚Äúbreakthrough infections,‚Äù DSHS defines people contracted virus two weeks fully vaccinated.‚Äù

Wonder anything deaths. it‚Äôs lot easier blame migrants let‚Äôs go that. assume J&amp;J? guess, way really matters. Another hundred thousand people spread across country hopefully improved immunity week now, vast majority resistant hospitalized better part two months, get second shots. Meanwhile, went ahead hundred thousand new cases today.

My state sitting 250 cases day two weeks ago we‚Äôre posting daily 1000s now. would ecstatic every antivaxxer state, country I‚Äôm fantasizing stuff, went got poked tomorrow. would incredibly good, still wouldn‚Äôt prevent what‚Äôs already happening. says 117 people ICU I‚Äôm assuming 133 total beds? conclusion 100 cases due facts wearing masks I'd rethink that. closed borders number real hard lockdowns might something that. Perhaps ask Australia? 

R Canada 1: vaccines **always** reducing chances dying Covid, catching/becoming ill it.

My mask stays on, continue ""driving defensively"" amongst folk supermarkets etc time risk really negligible courtesy science ... whether that's next year 5 years.

Lockdowns work people comply. many people don't. That's many nations facing, face, waves. someone coughing/sneezing mask-less crowded area I'm convinced sociopath Also, lockdowns effective way stop spread, we're supposed talk possibility anymore, unfortunately. extroverted self centered man follow covid restrictions. thank you, know try keep limber!üòú   Yeah, unfolding pretty much exactly expected. Heroic. right here. started telling us along trials showed less actual death. I'm ok that. People expect perfect realize want make people hysterical- said, new, know lot, may change recommendations data comes in, let's work together. Probably something like Delaware parking fines. states won‚Äôt arrest paying parking fine Delaware parking fine summons don‚Äôt pay failure appear summons issue arrest warrant that. Hey guys , wondering someone could help understand something. partner currently isolating tested positive via PCR test last week Sunday 25th, tested negatively 3 times previously via lateral flow. 

She took another lateral flow test yesterday line faint. Almost visible. 

Today symptoms started strong undeniable dark line lateral flow. 

Does mean tested positive virus‚Äô incubation period via PCR need wary symptoms today‚Äôs lateral flow strongly positive? asking I‚Äôm bit concerned her! 
Thanks much husband qualify olympics mental gymnastics you‚Äôre doing.  legend born diapers on. Something like 6 people exposed Ebola. applicable example. work big 4 firm made decision stand original guidance requiring masks office unvaccinated individuals. 

Of course don‚Äôt know isn‚Äôt vaccinated company it‚Äôs medical advisors believe protocols place sufficient keeping us safe. 

There isn‚Äôt always one right way. CDC made clear they‚Äôre untrustworthy I‚Äôm proud work somewhere that‚Äôs looking org end-all, be-all.  I'm introvert male I'm getting tests required certain activities, checked entry. reason anyone ever got tested test sites anyways.

If want yourself, buy one &lt; 1‚Ç¨ supermarket, much easier booking appointment test site. No. even see CDC said yet. find anything I'll reply back here. Thanks!  recovered Covid infection, clear get second dose soon it‚Äôs offered. Yes, vaccinated follow precautions, denominator misleading aren‚Äôt randomly testing vaccinated people Provincetown.


The recent NJEM study reported 12% vaccinated people Pfizer developed symptomatic infection. son's camp summer masks. kids issues them.  Ew. Fucking hell. literally personal hell.  Per capita numbers important, time death rates like reflective current situation. north east deaths happened March/April last year one idea treat it, vaccine, remdesivir, getting hold ventilators like Hunger Games.

Current death rates highest NV, AK, LA, FL, MO, WY. taking consideration fact vaccinated people get covid worse, easily asymptomatic spread others.

But could still right. Nearly unvaxxed person likely exposed next two months. Children going back school happen people racing get vaxxed protection. understand ads aren‚Äôt reflection reality‚Ä¶ right? enjoying no-mask life 18 months Europe, feels great. Yeah, large swinger place totally shut down. large freight company bought building revamping it. would go large outdoor event, two I'm planning go probably cancel. I'd still wear mask many people, although crowds venues can't compete bear festival. I'm fully vaccinated, partner say I'm glad trust fund set me. I've already steeled worst. can't change anyone's thinking twisting arm. However got vaccinated, lived tell tale, three people know too. Minimal restrictions? Lmao perpetual lockdown sorry. heart breaking parents young children put impossible spot. mom too...please tell thank sane people, actually they‚Äôre vaccinated guess won‚Äôt meet her. saw redditor claimes ICU nurse say majority patients vaccinated....is validity this? They're claiming vaccines dont work delta period, transmission symptom reduction acute COVID, yes, proactive/protective measure. COVID vaccine ""cures"" COVID it.

In case acute COVID, early stages, may give monoclonal antibody treatment (e.g., Trump got Regeneron, one MAB treatment). Monoclonal antibodies manufactured antibodies similar body would produce weeks vaccination. would injected body fight COVID, body made antibodies. Note early stages, virus that's causing problems. early stages, body generally fought virus, immune response seems go haywire, causes severe COVID. point, MAB treatments useful, since meaningful amount virus fight anywmore.

In case Long COVID, studies suggest dose mRNA vaccine helps Long COVID symptoms. seems case people, everyone. know causes Long COVID (it may ""bucket"" diagnosis, bunch different causes look terms symptoms). may waking body's immune system vaccination helps cases, apparently everytime. One thing consider HiV positive people strong immune systems viral suppressants use control virus.  chance could forbidden challenged court? Eg name freedum? That‚Äôs we‚Äôll visit. Guilt, blame shame emotions virus have. models mathematical constructs also take account people feel process.

Feelings important communicating people, modifying behavior. would future step applying learning model avoid expected negative outcome. That's models do. models say ""if this, get that."" behavior occurs also irrelevant model. relevant model many people engaged activity applies selection pressure, affects probability successful escape mutation. Naturally US small fraction global population makes less likely, precluded, successful mutations would arise here. that's relevant model obviously live connected world successful mutation travel India US completely take pandemic months, Delta did. Maybe people might want get enough confidence vaccine wear mask get it. Forcing people mask vaccinated exactly make fucking sense. fair, austin done very, well measures cases cannot understand hell masks makes wearing difficult. know comfortable thing wearing longer period time quite annoying see anything cause frustration, irritation anger. even usa, ive seen shit countries too.

What masks? Really? fair - look Disney‚Äôs salaried/executive ranks, white colored speak students, lot thrived remote school initial lockdown. teach gifted students (so kids are, part, little advanced) enjoyed able self-pace time pursue non-academic interests. getting many emails pictures art projects videos dances made siblings drafts short stories- things next time classroom. Word. three two year olds love wearing masks much fun (while lasts - doesn‚Äôt long). Luckily us we‚Äôre Australia it‚Äôs big deal toddlers try kids age (notwithstanding genuine reasons not) I'll start looking. mind? find posted anywhere, I‚Äôd like see it. looking, haven‚Äôt found yet. happen know reporting, whose show segment on? Let tell something, even begun peak. peak, know. I'm gonna peak hard everybody Earth's gonna feel it. Lots others periphery too. family consult Walmart, employed Walmart outside marketing/market research firms. one cousin engineer works Walmart's buildings' climate control systems..  anybody know within surge hospitalizations covid recently--what percentage fully vaccinated? hearing frequently people vaccinated still catching variant. Im sure news isnt going report would sway people away getting vaccinated. August 9th doesn‚Äôt even apply Americans. vaccine card won‚Äôt even help right unless Canadian. It‚Äôs likely either Canadian citizens permanent residents. Surface transmission question long live outside body, increased transmissibility people based much virus person carrying. Delta fragility previous variants, surfaces still safe. 

But, surface hand hygiene protect us *a whole lot more* corona virus, keeping habit isn‚Äôt bad idea case. Hope sticks. paste whole article? Paywall. Ugh. want move! It‚Äôs crazytown here. ""new deadly side effects"" rare disease still much much worse.

Have watch ""peanut butter"" video linked above.

CDC *not* ""forcing"" anyone anything. new ""recommendation"" masking.

The vaccines remarkably effective keeping people hospitalized dying. great explanation. Thanks. FDA approval red herring. soon approved they‚Äôll find fault approval process nonsense. self-taught don‚Äôt know least far Asymptomatic times seems. I‚Äôm talking symptomatic reinfected. expose chicken pox 1000 times would rest positive every time. doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs hurting anything Oh yeah, hospital staff, first aid helpers, psychologists, real self centered extroverts. selflessly helping people there‚Äôs plenty introverts sitting arse nothing help anyone

Excuse me, I‚Äôm plenty introverted, bullshit theory. lacking compassion puts risk well  Democrat office doubt it. parents Ga. fully vaxxed, retired able stay home. go try go early less people milling always double masked. unvaxxed pregnant neice baby shower today, inside venue, 100 people attendance (the crowd solidly anti-vax). kills mom, say can't go, wants part baby's life. hope shower harm niece attendance. Covid BAD Ga. people stupid. Throughout pandemic people charge future. 

I hope vaxxed Kansas gotten latest news spread also become breakthru case. Viral load two individuals hospitalized symptomatic infection, vaccinated not. That‚Äôs really surprising since hospitalization usually means immune system dropped ball infection running wild. 

But vaccinated person ‚Äúinfected‚Äù never develops symptoms? going viral load infectivity someone hospital dying thing. even read thing. Someone comments said online poll. seem like serious research. Perhaps researches think biggest issue world received funding someone thinks that. guardian paid ""researchers"" ""research"" made profit? Perhaps even paid little extra make results fit agenda? longer goes risk vaccine less effective. We're together. strange. understand anti-vaxxers recognise three-pronged approach essentially saying ""you're stupid get vaccinated, vaccines work work"" going convince get jabbed. love idea. People like pandemic end. 

I'm team mandate vaccine mask mandates hit 80% pop fully vaccinated. 

You're gonna vaccinate way this. not. vaccines + NPIs. selfish folk think \*you\* that's problem. worst pandemic United States probably behind us. vaccines now. That‚Äôs game changer. vaccines work wonderfully preventing death serious hospitalizations. mean pandemic over. means it‚Äôs unlikely see new wave deadly last winter‚Äôs. Agree 100%.

But anti-vaxxers using Provincetown news say ""Gee bother getting vaccinated protect getting infected."" point would draw conclusion Provincetown stats alone. right conditions, cigarette smoke travel 20-30 metres, little wind. gasoline fumes. wonder distances would still enough catch virus? That's funny true. DeSantis literally can't shit piss Disney Disney literally made Florida, lot power people realize. suggesting lie people instead? Vaccines protect hospitalisation death way masks obviously don't. Britain's SAGE scientists want [sustained long-term behavioural even though vaccine uptake is, what, around 90% UK? stretch assume attitude prevalent among scientists everywhere yeah, there's light end tunnel anywhere - Delta latest excuse go backwards. year write-off next year probably point we'll far removed normal going back possible. breathing deer ... thats 20,000 dollar question . many got sick require hospitalization and/or dyed though? low number. important media creating fear necessary. Positivity measure needs go away. Hospitalization fatality rates relied upon solely instead. know‚Ä¶like every disease. think reading wrong.

If 80% population vaccinated, **four times more** vaccinated people unvaccinated.

So, population 100,000, case 80,000 would vaccinated 20,000 unvaccinated.

Now, let's assume unvaccinated people twice likely get infected. Due much larger group vaccinated people, vaccinated group would still infections.

Basically, vacinated group much larger, can't compare smaller group unvaccinated

These headlines ridiculously harmful people understand them. They're trying get clicks, misrepresenting vaccines. since June 2020 Texas 50,000 Covid19 deaths.


And New York less 25,000 Covid19 deaths.




It's almost like one state learned happened earlier year, could protect citizens. state said screw it, fought every effort protect citizens. Bless heart deaths 4 hospitalizations connected Provincetown study. Breakthrough infections resulting death remain exceedingly rare. many ways considerable improvement pandemic situation. government officials dumb ability work solutions needed bring back normalcy. Yeah that‚Äôs unrealistic. Good luck that. Even US locked completely everyone wore masks, you‚Äôre forgetting rest world. 

The message passing bad anti vaxxers except opposite side spectrum. Nationwide = 0%. CA, OR, major cities ( outside places expressly forbidden governors/ state leg‚Äô) ? don‚Äôt want say definitely feels like definitely think theres word them.... asshole thats it!! oh deer Huh, everyone told whole time I'm overreacting newborn get sick it. Chinese Military can‚Äôt beat prices. Okay. Got countries confused. locked loaded, ready roll  You‚Äôre expecting accountability powerful lol bad many spineless buffoons (conservatives) power. They're collectively yanking wheel left steering entire ship cliff. Incredible allow people level immaturity make substantial decisions affect health wellbeing millions. rate (25.1%) 

Stop using term mortality rate. That's number referring to. confused. Guardian published news article scientific journal article. news article presented guardian generates guardian money people click it. true scientific journal article author's get money based views. I've outlines situation, I'll tell confusion. seems think RESEARCHERS scientific journal article, KNEW friends GUARDIAN would able write news article generate clicks. think good idea help friends guardian out, people provided researchers funding, also went along it. summarizing position correctly? I‚Äôve said bad reports Covid vaccinated subreddit. People nothing say typically gonna go post positive experiences. get vaccine forget move on. virus killed 4 million year defeated lockdowns, masks, isolation vaccines, evolution virus that's transmissible.

This thing IQ 0. even alive. kicking behinds. ‚ÄúI would definitely say thought pandemic over, least firmly rearview mirror,‚Äù Johnston said home Castro, he‚Äôs still recuperating. ‚ÄúI knew possibility getting COVID vaccinated, didn‚Äôt think would happen me.‚Äù

This dude like poster boy whole reported 140 coronavirus cases among staff 35,000 since mid June ‚Äî **80% infections among full vaccinated people**. ... Friday‚Äôs report Centers Disease Control Prevention focused 469 cases associated gatherings one Massachusetts county; **three-quarters cases fully vaccinated people**, 79% symptomatic illness.

These kinds results wild, completely odds led expect. 

We need make major adjustments collective thinking. rate (25.1%) 

Before anyone sees panics, increase reported deaths last week. mean virus 25.1% mortality rate. Nah there‚Äôs good list exemptions people allowed Canada aren‚Äôt citizens/PR. Evolution ‚Äúgoal‚Äù fit propagate.

Usually doesn‚Äôt kill host, let‚Äôs host continue living make more. truly random, sometimes killing many hosts, flourishing many others, well. correct. CDC guidance test vaxxed person unless they‚Äôre hospital, true numbers catching (asymptomatic mild) unknown time. believe they‚Äôre revising given new news week. want know real stats, I‚Äôve lot reading studies overseas coming since seem testing everyone more. trust chances hospitalized death low, I‚Äôm high risk personally trying avoid covid period I‚Äôd like know real numbers are.  Well, let's put aside caring unvaccinated. also people various immune compromising conditions vaccines work nearly well, all. Since know vaccinated people spread virus much unvaccinated, could put people danger wearing mask. 

There's also issue Hospitals potentially filling up, main problem whole time. hospital full Covid patients, people need treatment hospital may able get it. Even think unvaccinated end deserve it, vaccinated man heart attack can't get treatment soon enough nearest hospitals full? contributing spread virus situations like even vaccinated person due Delta Variant, unless mask up.

All even touching fact breakthrough cases fact thing. vaccine %100, including these. vaccinated people still get sick, hospitalized, even die. latter two still very, rare, thankfully, happen? Yes, could fault without ever knowing wear mask. 

Also, Delta Variant came result mutation viral spread, spreads, chances variant undermines precious protection still have. outright stop mutations virus masking, especially many parts world widespread access vaccines, much vaccine hesitancy mask refusal there? No, us mask potentially slow down, every infection avoided (or least lessened due reduced viral load mask wearing) could improve chances avoiding scenario. Omega Variant (or whatever want call it) nullify vaccines comes someone infected want mask up?

It known spread virus vaccinated person efficiently unvaccinated person, contributing spread wearing mask. That's CDC guidance changed, even us vaccinated wear mask. parents would complain staff would give in. Guardian writes headlines Facebook Reddit point. Good, scare them.. I'm fully vaxxed still scared get one unable vaxxed yet kids get it. need either fully vaccinated cough negative COVID test stuff. Right kind lax cases low (i.e. eat outside restaurant go store without proof test/vaccine) cases hit certain mark... able go bathroom public without COVID test showing vaccination certificate. That's cheap. 25 US 2 pack good, PS. Loved it! Japan became strange country compared kid.

How so? lived Japan 90s seem stranger back long time. BioNTech already produced mRNA delta trial going start August i‚Äôm sure 3rd regular dose booster thing

It's ""regular"" 3rd dose also expected increase protection delta. uptick death rates shouldn‚Äôt case active cases downward trend‚Ä¶

Deaths lag cases 2-3 weeks. look earlier peaks see typical gap dates cases deaths reported. It‚Äôs Guardian. It‚Äôs do. Well, asshole, last year half? Let guess: Louisiana Governor wants ban mask mandates makes think legit research? silly online poll news sites make money reddit woke culture. days enough put white men headline cause outrage take profit clicks comments. would serious scientist even consider making research? society benefit even full fledged research involving thousands participants? would anyone care ""this type white cis males responsible covid outbreaks""? don‚Äôt know buddy, I‚Äôm rando internet speaking piece like you. Kids 12 vaccinated. Kids 12 probably shouldn‚Äôt go go wear mask. kid sure shit wouldn‚Äôt take crowded amusement park pandemic types rationalize risk away forcing adhere strict vaccination mandate (and yes probably mask mandate kids) lot safer letting everyone honor system. safer experience would better everyone probably better business long run Disney going full YOLO counting money. big topic lately Provincetown outbreak 800 people infected, 74% vaccinated. Total 5 hospitalized, zero deaths. 5 4 vaccinated 1 unvaccinated.

My question is, numbers pretty similar hospitalization rate 800 unvaccinated? Something numbers seems concerning me. still 99% hospitalizations US unvaccinated? Get vaccinated, wedding planned :) (and make sure guests vaccinated well!)  joke. thought obvious joke. Thanks.

Love little (perhaps partially immune?) Baby, perfect, yellow poop all. current vaccines largely work Delta it‚Äôs viral load higher. efforts speed it‚Äôs probably effective get 3rd shot wait rollout delta booster. really get resistance masks either. really feel wear day work reasons.

You get resistance yet understand others affected you?

Your vaccination rate likely biggest contributing factor success. Places northeast US rates low seventies okay without masks. article mention many 4000+ cases athletes support staffs?

I place finger 90,000 new arrivals first city 14 million. I'm confused think honest.

That vaccines very, effective, variants going take us back early 2020.

Despite frankly bizarre passion media people sub try stoke fear vaccine inefficacy variants, even case Delta vaccines give serious protection symptomatic infection, high protection hostpitalisation even higher protection death. possible that's non factor. think enough data make caution prudent. I'd rather wrong wear mask ineffective wrong part chain infection someone dies. vaccinated individuals increase chance mild asymptomatic cases

This premise wrong. Vaccinated people less likely get covid. Makes sense, want shut down. Film sets lot stuff done mandated, even want risk costly delays even indefinite shutdowns. Agreed. Hopefully people learn take precautions seriously seeing results highly vaccinated populations.  don‚Äôt disagree. questionable public policy decision, clawing back makes lose credibility.

There always going another wave. Reintroduction large gathering events, bars returning 150% occupancy, festivals, concerts, sporting events, etc. 

Cases needs stop used metric, official thinks going eradicate virus delusional. Hospitalizations/severe disease/death need main drivers policy. original hope vaccine.

Vaccination drops likelihood hospitalization *if* get breakthrough infection lower hospitalization rate seasonal influenza. big win. joke everyone missed. Honestly, comments thread boggle mind. government narrative literally ""pandemic unvaccinated."" Thank you! couldn‚Äôt even throw ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù. I‚Äôd say ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs vaccines work‚Äù. HISD social distancing anymore, either. Lunch back cafeteria, school closures covid cases, etc. 2020 one best years I‚Äôve while. summer already much less enjoyable. Yeah people talked last night impression old obese getting seriously ill. seems like generalization Local toy shop life sized Elsa. Wears mask. vaccine freely available, what‚Äôs end goal comes reducing spread?

Masks don‚Äôt stop spread 100%.

We could 0 cases US still exposed new cases people traveling internationally.

The goal point continue push vaccinations, let virus run course, ensure hospitals don‚Äôt get overwhelmed. I'd like offer blase attitude people kids ICU spoken place immense privilege. vast majority country (not mention world) cannot afford this. minority public enough scientific knowledge worry them, enough reassure them, always prone making bad health decisions.

This perfect statement anti-vax people, would also apply suffer health anxiety. plan economic fallout would occur lockdown? 24 hours Moderna shot, wasn‚Äôt bad 2nd Pfizer. site pain super sore back / neck, otherwise minor headache much else. second Pfizer dose tolerable, weird prickly scalp sensations day didn‚Äôt care all. even large percent population vaccinated, still infections, vaccinations deaths among vaccinated. appears must continue social distancing, remote work home schooling virus completely eradicated. 11 year old incredibly excited finally go back school mother struggling even letting go back can't even enforcing mask usage classrooms.

Our household done everything right since beginning nonsense, live Texas sure seems like effort going nothing. Keeping social distancing forever realistic. Even unlikely event thing would mandated, we're social species people stop complying while. CDC fucked misinformation spreading internet? Maybe look elected officials media organizations amplifying misinformation? Yes, last year state policies much clear language ""public"". Something like ""establishments open general public"" excluding pretty much non-retail businesses. CDC language vague pandemic committee legal department trying figure mean. Cool want another economic disaster take None said ""speed along."" also previously said sucks wait long, important get dosage everything right. teach preschool, would say care great deal small children. likely drive Dodge Ram 1500 also... mean there's entire major US political party part platform ban gay marriage sure, woke crowd making mountains mole hills. 

Look I'm sorry tell but, psychology shown us frequently, people similar attitudes beliefs behave similar ways. Sometimes helpful figure attitudes beliefs associated behaviors. feeling personally attacked actions correlated certain psychological makeup, think issue might you... opinion becoming dangerous, governments politicians, woke mob able tolerate different opinions.

Ah see gunning ""cancel culture"" stuff trying use word. I'm going beat around bush here. obvious another conservative engineer know anything people thinks knowledge engineering means sort *extra* knowledge science. see TIME. want tell you, bottom heart, wrong. one cancels culture like conservatives. research showing certain personality traits linked certain behaviors cancel culture. Getting man fired simply gay certainly cancel culture. ""woke"" crowd that. I'm honestly disheartened dishonesty. You, me, everyone else alive KNOWS conservatives readily embrace cancel culture make dangerous express opinions. opinions ""black people equal"" ""gay people allowed get married"", conservatives cancelling people views centuries. cancelling, mean murdering. Stop acting like equivalent THAT. many studies need show narcissists like told even other's lives stake? went last year layoffs. talking one maintenance workers. genuinely upset lost friends, many known years. employees treated well. guess many already vaccinated. None said ""speed along."" also previously said sucks wait long, important get dosage everything right.  think studied well vaccine efficacy, idea masks reduce severity disease good theory it, good case studies. environments people fully masked, asymptomatic infection seemed much likely symptomatic. masks reducing viral load. 

Vaccines help body ramp attack faster, masks make virus's attack slower due starting lower numbers one right mind would vaccinate healthy child something likely catch likely asymptomatic from. That's lot Disney customers go. Disney toooo smart require customers No, prople diet, exercise, vitamin way pandemic. talk Covid minimizers commonly tried distraction. Ignore it. True. alpha variant, 95% effective severe illness something like 90% effective getting all

Feta still 91% effective severe illness 35% effective getting illness. 

Which CDC ting vaccinated people mask again. Risk severe infection went risk infection went way up. 

Many people say ‚Äúscrew unvaccinated, chance‚Äù people blindly forgetting every kid 12 can‚Äôt even get vaccinated yet. large percent cases hospitals right kids. odds convincing adult get vaccinated haven‚Äôt gotten already slim, tens millions kids risk still. Yeah direct contact eating/ licking leaves people touched No. subs political content. go there. year half that‚Äôs basically nothing. know many died cancer, diseases, car crashes? You‚Äôd shocked. Boston 75% 14+ fully vaccinated Yes, CDC needs lot disciplined messages delivering. need say things know true several months rather 180 every weeks.

E.g.:

""We long-term battle global virus, require sustained persistent effort everyone's part beat back. something weeks months, possible long-term changes society may needed.

Toward end, observing precautionary principle guidance going forward. realize may turn overly conservative cases, important goals nation preserve life health, spirit inform thinking agency best formulate recommendations country."" SW Missouri unvaxxed listen.

It going suck kids going hospital fall There‚Äôs shocker Less Cuomo, Murphy, Whitmer, Wolf. This. COVID outbreak event almost 100% people vaccinated 95% effective vaccine result majority infections vaccinated people. Vaccines works, lowes risk death, internation also virus' spread. sucks Ann Richards alive/in charge Texas always said Disney company high ethical standards!  100% sure think so. something targeting receptors mucosal lining course circulatory system doesnt anything. stop blaming florida spike neighbors coming here. wanna see football game person anything, breakthrough case data it‚Äôs real pretty concerning Concentrated larger cities, sure, also larger apartments, yards, cars ability keep distance.

I'm new yorker family Texas I'm fucking pissed happening. to. I‚Äôve lived Houston, Dallas, Austin. density cities counting compared New York. little public transit sidewalks empty. We‚Äôve squandered advantage thanks incompetent political leadership. Millions dead sick Americans bigger economic impact lockdowns.  400 children dead US fron covid last month. Tell families wonder many vaccinated people hospital actually vaccinated. mean could easily lie avoid guilt shame. ""Pregnant People"" it‚Äôs mask represents. vaccinated person largely protected. got taste freedom they‚Äôre pulling rug end sight. People like say ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs temporary‚Äù comes absolutely measures increase vaccination rates. unvaccinated still going wear masks never did. I‚Äôm punished *real* gain. 

What‚Äôs end goal here? know people say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt get people don‚Äôt like masks‚Äù probably end goal masking forever. us someday want go back normal, that? Mask efficacy increases parties wearing mask. Harder, better, faster, stronger. lot Black vaccinated ( 30% eligible vaccinated) lot Hispanic vaccinated (under 40% eligible vaccinated).  


The far right useful idiots fell victim Russian disinformation campaign targeting messages ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù take vaccine. people loudest social media get attention. Blacks Hispanics quietly vaccinated. No, I'm saying can't draw conclusions paper all. lacking essential data. idea I'm right, fact there's uncertainty problem. took ones refused get vaccinated would give damn, let die want. effects everyone around even people got vaccinated still get sick, family, healthcare pisses most. Something posted yesterday think everyone needs see perspective. actual Ct values obtained SARS-CoV-2 qualitative RT-PCR  
diagnostic tests might provide crude correlation amount  
virus present sample also affected factors 
 viral load.‚Ä†‚Ä†‚Ä† Although assay used investigation  
validated provide quantitative results, significant  
difference Ct values samples collected breakthrough  
cases cases. might mean viral load  
vaccinated unvaccinated persons infected SARS-CoV-2 also  
similar. However, microbiological studies required confirm  
findings.

Notice use may might quite bit? Also notice last sentence? zero reason act like findings 100 percent confirmed like media others doing. Vaccinated people MAY transmit extent one knows sure. Even studys author listed problems study. understand CDC cautious messaging lately given anti vaxxers lot ammo. never asked anyone wear mask.

For immunocompromised, protection better none. expect follow medical provider's advice live life.  Seriousely. crazy give vaccine young children without going appropriate trials. people must kids. Well less was. read account back Cruise industry CDC.. courts sided Wish another award give. Well put. Correct. misleading title, know percentage *adult men* circulating P-town unvaccinated. Knowing mindset, guess majority vaccinated. detail kinda requires resetting title, majority unvaccinated, many would required hospital stay.

The vaccines working intended, designed *alpha strain*. Delta strain came along vaccines distributed, surprisingly, less effective. vaccines are, high degree, keeping vaccinated people requiring hospital admittance, perfect shield Delta strain. sure standards honest. know shared database amongst EU countries. Luxembourg show get places, dependent group size. know anything spoofed sure going see mass movement that. 

Especially since authorities taking seriously (the vaccination rate 70% adults pretty moot stands). question many vaccinated would hopistalized and/or die. Probably many.

Completely eradicating virus feasible. delta different antigens? might need different vaccine, not. kind doubt case anymore. HIV concentrated urban rural areas IV drug use prevalent. It‚Äôs awful many gay men era addressed article dead caught back then. Perhaps kind camps set ""unvaccinated"". that? Japanese could probably again. Edwards probably best governor state ever had. He‚Äôs anything like southern governors. He‚Äôs tended follow science COVID since beginning. make life inconvenient people. Americans, better worse, fight mandates told do. hand, fold like house cards inconvenienced.

Don't mandate vaccine work. Make unvaccinated people get tested twice week deduct $15/test paycheck. couple weeks q-tip shoved nose, they'll get fed get vaccinated. want bet they‚Äôre Florida Texas governor says ignore it. Agreed. I‚Äôm sick hearing ‚Äúbut fogs reading glasses‚Äù like that‚Äôs awful thing. mention, easy solutions eyeglass wearers, people lazy seek out.    Probably going hit harder faster wave last winter. Less dead overall since vulnerable vaccinated, still significant numbers death.

But, it'll violently fast it'll recede pretty quickly too. That's easier deal ways.

Lockdowns? targeted measures probably enough prevent that, local stuff really hard hit places could happen. That's political question. knows? comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  It‚Äôs answer. much population willing get vaccinated, realistic option mass infection. need people antibodies. they‚Äôre going get vaccinated going force it, infection alternative.  Yes, anyone says it, people die. Yes, there‚Äôs chance mutate, chance still exists everyone masks up. possible, concern Florida rolled welcome mat tourists. Cruises beginning, weather great, beaches theme parks open, lot large events (sporting/music) taking place people attend combine quick weekend trip week-long holiday. leave, risk bringing Covid back home states increasing cases there.  So, let burn Florida (or states even trying anymore), cause flare-ups states outbreaks control. know CDC counts it, controlled studies UK Canada showing almost 90% protection two shot vaccines.

Those countries also longer intervals shots Israel US, may help increase effectiveness vaccine countries compared others 3-4 week intervals shots. So.... narcissists.   Exactly gay festival friendly. would take nothing this.

Was probably orgy people 60, everyone. I'm sure part confusing you.

This really get resistance masks either.

You seem get someone wear day like mandate, apply store. think it, really.

140 cases 35,000 low. That‚Äôs. .4%. I‚Äôm assuming vast majority 35000 vaccinated, fact numbers skew towards vaccinated people infected isn‚Äôt surprising.

Also, cape cod stuff similar scenario. highly vaccinated population.

When you‚Äôre measuring cases populations mostly vaccinated, breakthrough cases could outnumber non-vaccinated cases lower amounts non-vaccinated people. Trauma Service Area covers 11 counties 2.3 million people. They‚Äôre like 98% icu bed capacity whole region. Covid, heart attack, car accident, etc. someone J&amp;J doesn‚Äôt reassure all, terrifies me. think non-essential businesses cases surging (basically US right now) require customers show proof vaccination negative COVID test within past 2 days.

Most people go non-essential places go every week even frequently. Getting test *each every* time want go really, really, really sucks, people still want go fun things spontaneously choose get one/two vaccine doses done it.

People can‚Äôt get vaccine due religious health reasons still option testing, one discriminated/left out.

People still option stop going non-essential places don‚Äôt want tested vaccinated. Food locations, pet stores, parks, post offices, essential businesses won‚Äôt require tests vaccines.

This policy
- Increases vaccination rates since vaccination convenient option get non-essential businesses.
- Increases testing rates accurate case tracking &amp; contact tracing.
- Makes people feel safer going non-essential businesses (good customer business).
- Reduces COVID cases, hospitalizations, deaths.
- Allows people enjoy experiences non-essential businesses without many unvaccinated/anti-mask/untested people around them.
- without discriminating people can‚Äôt get vaccinated reason - still test able go out. sounds like easily tolerated sacrifice though, midst pandemic.  Happy hear you. 
My decision send kids back person learning weighing day. 
We still low enough cases mostly going lives past couple months. 
We simply reinstated full masking, even outdoors around people. 

Fast forward weeks school starts, doubt still lucky. 
At state level cases doubled yesterday‚Äôs reporting. 
As immediate (walkable distance) community super high vaccination rates county still gathering steam, I‚Äôm full March 2020 mode yet. 

Ahh well, need procrastinate Reddit. 
I guess shift starting look @ online school options. 
Worst case unnecessary research, things get bad, I‚Äôll glad informed need potentially pull trigger. 

Good luck, stay safe!  serious? seems absurdly high‚Ä¶ 20 800 would **2.5%**. high IFR covid-19 is? I‚Äôve told it‚Äôs much lower. don‚Äôt know. mechanic work Triumphs?

Some states going realize extra hard way, countries right now. extra sting 'free' shield would've saved loved one's life, listened idiots.   psychology. pointless shit meant push woke agenda men masculinity. There's enough stupid people believe shit mob people following rules. Mobbing becoming real western world habits traditions labeled racist homophobic antisemitic something else banned. Expressing opinion becoming dangerous, governments politicians, woke mob able tolerate different opinions. That's things middle ages different mob. Yes, plus 3) doctors nurses treat sick. densely populated cities, Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, name few. However ever driven across Texas know mostly empty. population concentrated large cities. It‚Äôs almost doesn‚Äôt really matter. *Men penis size complexes* - FTFY thought meant ejaculate extreme displeasure. ... ignored. ‚ÄúAfter all, governor prohibited every state entity ‚Äî including employer, University Texas ‚Äî imposing mask mandates. Thursday, signed new executive order bans entity receiving state funds requiring Covid vaccinations employees customers, also prohibits local governments taking additional suppression measures even hospitalization rates pass 15 percent.‚Äù

Everything self inflicted they‚Äôre trying pin blame elsewhere. forgot ""libertarian"" still wearing mask, that's good. say Immunocompromised people take vaccine, work well them.  say ""stay home"" either, said wear mask, also CDC saying, gave reasons asked someone to. know Pfizer boosters given Israel aged 60+ original vaccine updated Delta focused vaccine? Imagine dying bc dumb.  Hi. husband feeling? side effects? Even medical insurance, people get $100k medical bills time. hard differentiate. spend couple hundred month car insurance, little easier understand. ordering food homes.

Grocery shopping bound tests (at least Austria), folks spread way stores back.

Also working office mandates it, companies really 3G checks.

3G ask?

Getestet (tested, obviously)

Geimpft (vaccinated)

Genesen (recovered) Vaccinated people wear masks indoors public. don‚Äôt know exact percentage people contract covid vaccinated definitely much higher original strains. transmissibility much higher vaccinated person gets infected, seem able spread covid. original strain R0 (transmissibility rate) R2, meaning one infected person would typically infect two people. Delta variant R0 8 9!! event Provincetown saw 800 infections 75% among vaccinated people concerning everyone. knew 6 people fully vaccinated. 6 returned home infected covid showing symptoms. still don‚Äôt know whether people develop long covid also. real reason concern vaccinated people. delta variant new virus game changed now. virus fought past year half. really changed. using tools last year. They're best, hit miss. I'm going lake Travis week.

Note, saying vaccine worse taking. I'm saying can't possibly know every possible side efrdct  New York state 20m. probably comparing population New York City. sucks learn hard way.

The suck everyone else stuck paying bill less. understand that, statement lockdowns Canada months correct providences strict restrictions. leave province, even see wife. brother (medical doctor) works clinic owner purchased test/diagnostic machine (idk they're technically called) long ago, iirc said cost around 150 000 NOK, presumably they're making decent profit considering low initial investment.

That‚Äôs clicked put together breakthrough infections P-Town Bear Week. think shit going bound outbreaks reason kids wear masks help protect older people want protect themselves. force millions kids wear masks save bunch idiots want help makes zero sense. Let non vaccinated non mask wearers get covid let's get actually educating kids. kids start school 3 weeks.

I‚Äôll take bet. number pandemic deaths next 12 months United States likely lower number number pandemic deaths last 12 months United States. 

Now ‚Äúremind me‚Äù thing always see people doing? believe include elective travel. always political horse really can't turn back. started Trump refused wear mask media it. US remember talks social distance, washing hands, NYC started disinfect subway cars night, every single one them... changes days. 

I'm happy live country never lockdown, face mask requirement, schools open whole pandemic (I'm sure children thank us tomorrow) - vaccines available protected elderly first. able take beer day (Yes period bars closed 8 PM, yes table serving, yes social distancing open) Oklahomans worse boat. pediatric ICUs past capacity they're sending patients Texas care. South mess. trying defend Texas, [if sort deaths population Texas US Sure, exist well although furthers point conclusions based data misrepresented. still believe (not all) people vaccinated informed enough hear 95% efficacy initial vaccine data. people smart enough know 95% equal 100%. percentages widely discussed early days vaccine many didn‚Äôt want J&amp;J less effective. may tuned know efficacy certain strains, efficacy rates really preventing serious illness may know everything. rarely met people believed vaccine meant 0% chance get Covid case. Also it‚Äôs something unvaccinated shouting every social media platform loud (that still get vaccine) it‚Äôs really hard imagine significant portion still believe that, sure, lot. Cuomo recently found fault nursing home deaths Attorney General doesn‚Äôt care pisses off. yeah aren‚Äôt going believe that.

You obviously don‚Äôt understand trajectory Covid. hit ny hard early long vaccines anyone knew control it. came NY three major international airports dense population. Honestly people NY pretty happy way Cuomo handled it, state 75 percent first vaccine. 

Now states severe outbreaks zero excuses. didn‚Äôt want take plentiful vaccine, didn‚Äôt want wear masks. blaming Democratic Governors somehow distracts abject failure Texas Florida, enjoy. COVID quickly became mostly cashflow operation. initial scare 2020 ""care health"" turned great selling point. delta floating around, getting one shot like heading putting one shoe 19%.

It 19% 3% vaccinated medical workers breakthrough infections, puts overall risk vaccinated person getting long haul symptoms upon covid exposure 0.57%. Layers protection what‚Äôs important. virus evolved yes, efficacy vaccine isn‚Äôt was. still protective, like bullet proof vest. wear bullet proof vest I‚Äôm going encourage people shoot me. Wishful thinking next variant shows up.  whole framing ‚Äúwearing mask impedes freedoms‚Äù flawed. actual places ppl dont freedoms wd laugh u.

We wear masks help save fellow human front us‚Ä¶. you‚Äôre suggesting canceling this, upcoming college football/NFL, concerts, gatherings, on.  
I think people picking Lolla particular it‚Äôs huge event city country, lot coming. Get vaccinated enjoy responsibly follow UK's trend, yes.  means nothing. it‚Äôs fully approved antivaxxer community move onto another excuse. won't. They're corrupt governing body accountable anyone. contagious severe variant virus now. would business lost? would people starve? Lockdowns equate things. poor execution initial one led us point, lockdown itself. Where? could let adult daughter make decisions. raised person, let her.  got free vaccine negligible side effects greatly lowers chances getting sick, chances getting seriously sick even more, pretty much brings chances dying 0. Even little bit less impressive thought weeks ago, remember Dec 2020, world would absolutely killed vaccine effective today. long infectious spread death host, COVID get much lethal without affecting ability propagate. everyone wants (including children) get vaccinated virus longer threat. goal keep hospitals overburdened. Buying health insurance vs. many Medicaid / Medicare debate me. abusing system right thing, vaccinating / masking / distancing . know, basic precautions. ? toll it‚Äôs taking country‚Äôs resources going cost us. cost healthcare already becoming / issue.  science denying? answer question, believe we're going eradicate thing?

I also never stated things prevent covid. purposely making problems? 

90% Americans DIDNT get covid, you‚Äôre saying TRUE. lying, literally. Sf Bay Area incredibly well right now. person job fully vaccinated contracted virus. hospitalized 3 weeks severe symptoms. vaccine minimize symptoms! That‚Äôs cute, let scientists look future variants let everyone else focus variants actually causing damage. saw headlines bought hook, line, sinker. 

Their data lambda it‚Äôs bad delta beta (for various reasons), time stop posting it. never said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt watchful upcoming variants‚Äù, data comes stating there‚Äôs variants higher concern - reason constantly post ‚ÄúLambda‚Ä¶‚Äù. Again, saw headline said ‚Äúomg‚Ä¶‚Äù, didn‚Äôt use critical thinking skills look studies/preprints. So‚Ä¶you‚Äôre still wrong . understanding virus becoming less lethal time.  future variants may even less potent transmission mortality.  heading towards COVID endemic like common cold?

It seems virus many tricks sleeve evolutionary perspective already played hand. I've also heard, anecdotally mind you, lot cases hospitals right mild. people get sniffles, test positive COVID, go hospital fear they're going die. wonder widespread much due current messaging. anecdote couple ICU nurses Florida. CDC says 610k Covid deaths far. 330 million people country. Covid deaths per 100k population country 185.

New Jersey - 299
New York - 276
Pennsylvania - 217
Michigan - 212

Florida - 180

So, made 185 baseline, Florida better national average. That‚Äôs I‚Äôm worried about

Even r naught value low 6 previous estimate; still puts everyone risk exposed delta variant point within next year!

If haven‚Äôt already, please get vaccinated! Nice know I'm exception Science denier probably watching lawsuit filled NCL cruise company FL law Covid tests free European countries? literally cannot rebuild lost businesses people starving often becoming homeless. AFAIK expanding candidate pool isn‚Äôt supposed impact timeline release. believe Pfizer Moderna said would still releasing data along originally proposed dates‚Äî specifically recall Pfizer saying would still apply EUA kids September. you. don‚Äôt want get tested, don‚Äôt.

I'd get tested outbreak, worried last month. Sorry ambiguous don‚Äôt make risk profile assumptions rest us.

The majority people going grumble masking bad messaging increasingly questionable assumptions works together.

If want infect relatives, start masking time visit them. forced test basically activities Germany Potential extreme opinion here. refuse get vaccinated get covid get benefits state medical system tax payers aid related like sick pay, rent aid etc. think waiting longer lot. let us learn long term damage covid spread like neurological damage. let us expand plans deal delta (a 3rd booster discussed). many non-republicans Deep South tho. Democrats non affiliated people. Yup. need long, uncomfortable conversations societal vs. individual risk, respond crises. 

Unfortunately, crisis time that, happen certain level ‚Äúdone.‚Äù  Still take weeks benefit bunch fucking selfish idiots. Antivaxxers get tested forced anyway, shed virus around. 

If anything, they‚Äôd fake test certificates. Texas used successful measure NYC did, would saved people.

[Actually, there's pretty strong evidence TX's restrictions really helping time TX's reopening associated increased COVID cases 5 weeks later (on flip side, ""reopening"" lead increased employment sure people think NYC killed vulnerable high exposure levels

Nowhere claim that. However, dramatic number people infected first surge New York -- [one study suggested 20% infected Nov. (before winter's wave). also know extremely high levels infections/deaths nursing homes first wave. 

My point nothing beyond expect place higher levels natural immunity lower amounts spread/death disease place lower levels natural immunity Yeah, think need recommend simple policy stay it, try ride ups downs spike (which effect exacerbating spike).

I assume winter going bad last winter, least case numbers, given summer turning worse last summer. Although countries digital vaccine passport. Surely that's secure q vaccination card? read post pissed. could overlook this??? local governments deciding policy without information. Thank you. concern. said evidence review valid asked mechanism would render masks *ineffective*, said R0. study invalid simply R0 variant strain higher. transmission general, simply R0 higher, there's reason think masks still provide benefit. 

Also, R0 higher mean need less virus infected, Delta, infected people shed virus. good news vaccine rates amongst 12+ age group (since newborns) literally go up. There's way change mind un-vaxx. Either vaccinations death unvaccinated numbers go slowly surely. Yeah expected better guardian usually hold high standard. said, take word interested arguing numbers.

What I'm trying understand two things -

Do agree OPs implication governors ""kill"" people policy?

If so, believe governors accountable people kill, long average percentage state's population? like even get hold vaccination card first place photocopy?. guess people got vaccinated photocopying cards selling something. like easier cheaper actually get vaccine? limits much deference fellow man owes you, particularly country provides little individual. It‚Äôs 18 months. rich able go UK best example Anybody else sitting waiting new vaccine targeted Delta variant supposed able made turn page?

The technology - there's much fucking red tape matter fast vaccine altered. infuriating... Social distancing default me. evidence that? variant much infectious. means much easier anyone unvaccinated get infected. people infected strain original strains. going get much worse! original strain transmissibility rate (R0) 2. means every infected person would infect 2 people average. delta variant R0 8 9. person infected spread average 8 9 people. Get vaccinated wear mask. not, alternative spreading now? Either get vaccine get virus. stay home hide it, wear masks, see friends family, can't control everyone never matter long still going outside waiting you. fact life need accept. Even somehow, unfathomable way, could get 100% US comply still entire rest world contend with. Positivity rate dropping well. People getting paid this‚Ä¶ doubt, also factor loads unvaccinated tourists come here, spread germs, leave. sense, lot ""population"" vaccinated. done via survey, demographic comply also less likely tell truth complying. anything study states, Self-centered men likely say complying restrictions. Events like went Provincetown happen time. mean, Lollapalooza still happening Chicago weekend, expect thousands music fans together tight quarters zero masks. 

It's good representative study happens crowd bunch people together. Sex sex. article title 100 percent shitposting hilarious Yeah sports comparison good. Sports political identification instances tribalism.. us vs them. fucking hate tribalism. Yes - eat less exercise more.

That‚Äôs billions dollars jobs levels income ladder.

You‚Äôre right gathering large groups isn‚Äôt best public health standpoint right now, situation evolved beyond what‚Äôs best public health standpoint. economy can‚Äôt handle another shut down, country tolerate it. We‚Äôre already dealing inflation hampers stimulus efforts. virus endemic, anti-vax sentiment. virus threat never going away. Unless locked entire globe, vaccinated 100% human population once, kept everything locked global cases single digits months, kept rigorous global testing tracing regiment place years after. Vaccines largely keep hospital. may still get it, may even get really sick, got vaccinated likely fine long run. point need accept life dangerous used there‚Äôs much it. Vaccine passports personal risk tolerance way forward. Ok dude. Let's ignore 99% others think awesome restrictions whatsoever, selectively focus ones complaining. Confirmation bias much?

I know like 4-5 groups people went Florida. None give shit pandemic never taking seriously all. loved fact shit Florida regards precautions. type people criticizing Florida. yeah, anecdotal stories anecdotal stories. Lots companies, least tech space, still WFH. Current guidance work reassessment early next year. I'm sure ""allowing get overwhelmed"" means. charge new cases supposed hold magic wand stop new cases happening?

Hospitals reactive mode like everyone else. serious cases happen area, get overwhelmed whether like not.  Unfortunately, hospital admissions usually reflect transmission events happened couple weeks previously, kind tail whip.

You need get vaccinated apply you. US regulatory framework setup wartime medicine. Yes sir, reddit police. fuckin tool, get life. That's number found icu beds aph. another number? Sorry, thought pointing apparent peak cases, realize makes sense pointing ""vaccinated vs. unvaccinated"" thing. Still half country unvaccinated there's still plenty people fill hospitals shut everything New York one, excelsior. Remains seen whether used theaters That‚Äôs works. shown delta variant, virus become lethal transmissible. affecting younger people children more. also significantly transmissible. time goes on, lucky enough survive infection develop natural immunity (and possibly long covid). This, along people vaccinated, slow spread. slowing spread, reduce chances variants develop. nothing say even lethal strain couldn‚Äôt develop. Also, Millions survive infection. fact, already 3.5 million deaths worldwide officially probably several times that.  Ditto that. can't / want make vaccine mandatory. also difficult so. fine possible. Read article :) train wreck be. know levels normally (even inaccurate) notice change even raw numbers slightly New York State country it'd sixth highest death rate per capita world, bit weird use comparison. tests required certain activities, checked entry

Now makes sense  want pay smokers, people drink alcohol fat eating habits... would work. go far study either bad neutral news time. bad take stats face value. neutral think many confounding factors can't take face value.

It good news *unconfound* factors (starting knowing vaccination rate cohort study one huge key) results look fine. We're speculating try (if vaccination rate 90%+, results look fine), speculation.

To see experts spin good news vaccines without unconfounding anything disappointing scary. depend experts figure stuff out. Like many experts saying Israeli data bunk. There's way lay person figure stuff out, need expert. Read article commenting problem people wanting get vaccinated even though walk local CVS get one. thankfulness able move Florida hits year second thankfulness able get vaccinated March. husband works lot. tiny fraction lot employees belong union.

Is ensure vaccine safe kids. Apparently not. concerned convincing hesitant parents get kids vaccinated moving quickly full approval flyer EUA. us would get kids vaccinated wait. FDA used two month data criteria adults kids would vaccinating 5 11 year olds right every kid would opportunity vaccinated school starts. 

Screw bureaucratic holes. also likely wrong. people vaccine hesitant going moved trial six months data opposed two. Knowing large number people kids vaccinated fine going far effective giving assurance. happens start vaccinations.

Here information FDA‚Äôs thinking news article.

‚Äú FDA's rationale behind collecting safety data extended period time, according NBC, speed process getting vaccines fully approved kids 12. Collecting six months follow-up data would significant that's minimum length time drugmakers must monitor clinical trial participants adverse effects (like long-term side effects breakthrough infections) order receive full FDA approval vaccine. hope swiftly issuing full approval EUA would boost vaccination rates kids 12 making hesitant parents feel reassured vaccine safe children, FDA official said.‚Äù Using logic, family feel fine driving opposite direction freeway. 

Sorry. sucks. heard vaccine becoming completely useless? Maybe stay internet while. state? OK AR rough spot, TX too. Since Delta variant extremely contagious spreading insane levels, many people talking cases starting decrease weeks. proof anywhere happened happening US? This, much. always wavering deleting mine, pandemic final straw. I've able handle life much better since. missed word ""almost"". 98% people vaccinated 95% effective vaccine, 70% infections would vaccinated people. Like people play video games 40 hours week gorge chicken tenders every night aren‚Äôt self-centered‚Ä¶. way. really. usually say yoy qre vaccinated. things usually enforced.

There way know sure small town Texas school care not. No.

If spend 15+ minutes area 6 feet away someone Covid, means certainly exposed are, relatively speaking, likely get sick.

It's kind exposure event, kind used baseline level unacceptable risk population level spread Covid. 6 feet away spend less 15 minutes room Covid, nonzero risk contracting Covid. Thank Canada looked aph number beds ICU. said 24. Unless u different info? Regardless whether news positive negative, analyse articles find criticisms. certainly make feel better, often criticisms make feel worse.

This whole point critical thinking - assessing whether information provided worth taking seriously.

For academia, would back points data studies, however Reddit, 'common sense' criticisms fine. yes, unvaccinated people almost certainly less likely get feel like many people used saying ‚Äúof course % infected vaccinated goes people vaccinated‚Äù haven‚Äôt looked numbers case.

I actually looked numbers case. something like 78% cases vaccinated, 72% people fully vaccinated.

As people vaccinated unvaccinated, point makes sense. case, there's going on, people often forget vaccinated group much bigger (in case 28% vs 72%, almost 3 times size).

I felt like layman take account stuff. Commenting help others effectively analyse study judge credible results are.

Also, many places results unvaccinated people over-represented cases. study looked one area vaccinated people represented cases, flawed sense area may results due random chance.

I could pick random towns check cases vaccinated vs unvaccinated, eventually I'd find town vaccinated people overrepresented. warrant worrying article?

I think entirely flawed, fear mongering, useless information. Taking staff materials + depreciation account. I'd guess something like 20-25% margin end. think daylight robbery they're kindness hearts either. thing apply become junkie abuser? line get drawn mean infections vaccinated people, right? sample unvaccinated people.

Maybe emphasis fact despite know things might change quickly adapt try find new way out. quite sure nobody ever thought variants would like quite sure nobody wanted things end like this. 

I personally want believe information long covid, many people get kind symptoms have, alongside vaccination monitoring variants outbreaks find way return way used live. guardian world class reporting mental.  


To get vaccine personal choice. vaccines FDA approved next year. Large trials done ‚Äòemergency use‚Äô designated. Yes Yes. are.

Personally know single person (vaccinated otherwise) thought pandemic over.

Seriously? explain Mexico then? statements prove dishonest twat. flu never leading cause death United States century.

As someone travelled lot business conferences, I‚Äôve prove pretty much every boarder guard every country I‚Äôve materials I‚Äôm bringing purposes meetings, materials sold. Yes us smart ones mandates kept everyone safe back - shot peeps fuck (obvs kids cannot get shot) I'm sorry public health workers put still going pandemic. truly shameful. Similar election workers states results ""didn't turn right"" enduring. enough make want leave country, lunatics could ""win"", whatever means. Fair enough... seems we're lot behind thing media social narratives suggest. Cyprus starting tomorrow require one every 72 h go work shop, indoors outdoors.

Fair indicate comparison total population measure UK still beats US.

Schools definitely many recorded outbreaks logically contribute spread. past year half torture me, I'll going trip NYC september, I'm really scared there'll restrictions, already even paid Yankees Jets tickets, nice timing part guess 201 listed serious/critical according Worldometer country 9 million.

Yep - can't expect nurse's blur education likely even cover devices instilled tidbit information among brain holes. again. Symptomatic reinfection. happening large scale. recruits mandatory testing. way caught. not, never would known. certainly help!

I think though people talk excessive alcohol consumption, mean chronically? [as opposed party weekend]

If still want send info point direction, I'm certainly willing give look. Sounds like could useful line work. Gestorben (dead)

Gehirnschaden (brain-damage) You‚Äôre absolutely right. 

My school (small US private middle school, grades 5-8) in-person year last year masks, cohorts, semi-adherence distancing ventilation (depending faculty member charge given situation). Frequent testing never discussed option. 

From understand, lot private schools around us. public schools around also fully virtual lot year - think gradual return in-person spring, I‚Äôm sure exactly policies were. Really? I've different experience. times tests actually checked. 

I'd fully support mandatory vaccinations btw. Good really incredible. Unfortunately also advanced spreading insane conspiracy theories. link study? really? Eg US peak daily infections 300k January peak daily vaccines administered 5 million, meanwhile 7-day average daily vaccines around 600k. Last year vaccine. people protect getting vaccinated, mask mandates end punishing people right thing got shots.

Unvaccinated people, children, etc. wear masks. choose to, irresponsibility.

Vaccinated people still afraid catching wear masks too.

No one forced, though, unless like said, hospitals might get overwhelmed. autistic 4 year old zero issue wearing school taking eat. impede learning language catching speech. 

Makes uneasy think fall going like. I‚Äôm worried, considering husband cancer clue vaccine got back January worked due immunosuppressive meds. know gonna sound stupid hear out. said multiple times mask mandates stay mask mandates. usually evolve voluntary soft lockdowns even required local governments big issue people them. Well found proof this.

Check safety protocols two Dave Busters locations see see difference. One mask mandate local government, mask mandate, one one LA one another part California mask one mask mandate mask mandate, games closed etc sounds like boring experience. private business either, used Dave Busters quick example.  Hopefully mutates something resembling common cold data misleading. clearly released suppress negative media around vaccinations calm people vaccinated feel lied to. poor job one. ""breakthrough cases"" getting media attention, low numbers show pandemic mostly threat unvaccinated numbers: 99% vaccinated infected, per 0.004% hospitalized virus. 

The numbers shown comparing total infections take account new delta variant. although claim may true one point, valid context delta wave far infectious actively infecting large portions vaccinated population. conclusion pandemic threat unvaccinated population simply true more. 

99% vaccinated infected, 0.004% vaccinated hospitalized - yeah data acquired delta around.  relative general population cases deaths relative vaccinated unvaccinated population. might late too. easiest J&amp;J, one shot, 2 weeks kick in. vaccines need 4 weeks jabs, plus 2 weeks fully effective. guess 1 shot better nothing, chances still getting high. Jeese that's shocking. know 32 36 year old died last week. Unvaccinated , UK. know long covid sufferer 22. Long short get vac 18+ sure

now thats 5 Gs remote learning, in-person classes. masks social distancing required buildings. Dude, would make much easier keep track keys! I'm extrovert I'm going back full-on isolation. sick internet telling deserve die love lockdown. Tell belong r/CovIdiots without telling belong r/CovIdiots. doubt booster needed sooner later. question really is: new vaccine formulation that's optimized variants? going start production quantities? correct proof long term issues covid far none vaccine? Lol anything completely wrong. There's reason North Yorks best yorks lol. yeah Lots people still wearing masks town North Yorks happy say least. Come September vaccine shots boosters start elderly looking like Christmas might normal one us.  Sorry skepticism, source reporting this? googled found OK hospitals reporting worrying PICU utilization attributed RSV spiking, can't find anything OK hospitals diverting PICU pts Texas Everyone hates manufacturers granted immunity lawsuits damages vaccine, that‚Äôs exactly it. 

Efficiency would telling companies enroll extra kids trials began, supposed end. youre that, stop covid? Make ""overweight"" tax give credit fit people. passed 1k stimulus check get take vaccine. 50% x 1.14 = 57%.

That means 57% 14% larger 50%.

I know might look/sound silly, correct way look numbers.

It equivalent saying two towns, one 25% vaccinated one 50% vaccinated, town 50% vaccinated *double* (meaning 100% more) vaccination rate town 25% vaccinated. would want say vaccination rate 25% higher. 100% higher.

Make sense? EEOC already cleared mandates EUA. Wow. Okay, week then. source updated today yet looked.

Woo-hoo! New yearly record! Social media companies (facebook) taking upon limit spread disinformation. much better chance countering stopping spread misinformation lies since apply AI algorithms back end scan filter billions posts day. contributions US intelligence community would drop bucket comparison. flaw penalizing anti-vaxxers huge fines would suddenly radicalized pocket population heavily armed, feel persecuted beliefs also feel like nothing left lose. 

The outcome policy like spotted miles away that's one power considering something like capacity. Hope canada goes revenge extradition streak made seize chinese businesswoman political prisoner sham charges get trade war leverage. got two canadians seized china retaliation  rich country talking US, need worry poorer nations creating new deadly variants we're perfectly capable states 40% vaccination. import new deadly variants create home? LOL it/a lot RSV. mask mandates lifted kids interacting first time year, winter virus going around summer ADDITION COVID. Well I'm shocked. NOT! messaging confusing sure. specifically doesn‚Äôt help ‚Äòget vaccinated‚Äô campaign. FTFY- Ronny Ron FunQy Bunch I‚Äôm sorry hear loss. üôè One dose vaccination expected provide much protection compared two dose, 54% LA county -- massaging statistics implying single dose provide meaningful protection. half population (those fully vaxxed) responsible 20% cases, vaccine better 50% preventing infection. Sorry, that's ""very effective"" messaging pre-Delta suggesting 95% effectiveness preventing infection older strains. problem ""understanding statistics"" -- vaccine simply offer 95% protection virtually implied (and correctly so) CDC others older strains.

So, vaccine that's half good used preventing infection, coupled strain that's twice transmissible. leave us never worried dying going hospital, want protect long covid, since we've seen (firsthand cases) young healthy?

I'm going lie people sugar coat proper numbers feeds group people illogical they're unlikely get vaccinated someone close dies. someone going see fact let feed whatever narrative want, that's them. denying vaccine anywhere near good thought would be, however, maybe one convinces vaxxed person something unsafe would hurt loved one -- refuse participate that. Introverted, reddit virgins upset real men getting lives. two things! speak perspective UK. vaccines licensed 18s. think maybe 8 12 weeks front Delta variant exposure. Prior kids finishing summer half year group confirmed close contact. said mortality 18s tiny. I'd surprised one 30 million. said kids starting present hospital, albeit recover quickly cases. government still sitting fence regarding vaccinating 18s. seeing shortages shelves due app telling people isolate. changes 15th people double jabbed ignore this. short low risk 18s Delta see it. 98% dominant here. last... people thinking going lead tidal wave evictions...

Back rent starting April **2020** due March 1st **2022**. almost *2 years* pay backrent.

Wow Nokia all! (/s) percent eligible adults important, covid check infecting, total percentage population applicable. 

There number studies schools big contributors spread. want CDC approve children vaccines asap, I'm even ok masks school when/where outbreaks higher, many people gloss incredible value in-person school average child.

We already see sharp increase developmental &amp; learning issues youth last year, cannot increased another year. Modern science allowed us bloat population numbers carry water lot idiots. Pre-industrial age, world fucking slog survive couldn‚Äôt muck you‚Äôd dead would genepool. don‚Äôt kids, huh? Honestly think saying (barring implication private individuals actual ""duty"" educate) laudable. I've indeed saying (on website, elsewhere) policy focus promoting vaccine whatever ways get needles arms.

Regarding original post thread responded. Delta spreading vaccines available. entirely possible catch (perhaps unknowingly) spread it. willfully unvaccinated individual line event may catch die (directly another carrier). Obviously want happen. I'm driving want someone jump front car get injured, that's always possibility. (assuming fault, morally legally), health outcome ""my problem""? not. still drive daily basis. (I live NYC / car reality let's assume example.)

Similarly, personally change behavior detriment service negligent (the willfully unvaccinated). felt safety safety negligent (the vaccinated) risk, would take reasonable precautions. willfully unvaccinated person catches COVID bad health outcome, much morally responsible. least, one else bears moral responsibility.

Don't mistake lack empathy, however. Negligence frequently leads genuine tragedies, whether talking COVID anything else. empathize recognizing society large responsible every bad outcome. certainly educate people things proven reduce health risks (vaccines case). ultimately much failure part everyone accept message. Oh yea, look comments! old r/Coronavirus remember haha!

Ignore science facts lead emotion ideology! like 80 euros test getting downvoted? data Israel considered represent real world results Delta hope someone answer this. booster shot identical vaccine first 2 shots? Forget it, German legal system allow kind bs. Seems fair. state county minimum wage standards supersede Federal rates.

And yeah sucks even live society requires money survive. Seriously society made money way separate not.

I'm sorry 14% come from? also way ‚Äúopen‚Äù February traffic anything go by.   study conducted university researchers published good quality scientific journals. real research. *Alberta entered chat* 

We removed restrictions eliminated much monitoring. don‚Äôt much virus infectious. chance infection depends viral load. good article early explaining this. delta amount virus expelled much higher. get masks travel higher distances. One way another either strong immunity vaccines past infections get strong immunity catch delta variant. Nothing sort total isolation medical PPE avoid this. Im saying charge extra test going disincentivize people get tested. means less testing meaning harder track breaks. 9% people vaccinated US (and yes know article US). need tools get defeat new variant. way would backfire dramatically. thought pretty simple policy. don‚Äôt know would simplify further. Jacked dualies around here, never carry kind load bed.  You‚Äôre missing large group people permanent quality life reductions - hard get dressed, tired time, can‚Äôt wait stairs‚Ä¶ agree lockdowns definitely tough small businesses, I'm curious impact public sector jobs. several relatives public librarians complaint heard go back work person felt safe. maybe similar private sector businesses large library systems good funding alright smaller libraries less funding struggled. Rethink how? sounds like proposing longer large gatherings together (but lots small ones still okay?). 

I'll go back original question, what's end game point get everyone vaccinated infected attain endemic status? thing see really choice long takes happen. speculation (not yet confirmed study) myocarditis risk reduced longer interval doses. Speaking train wreaks anyone heard anything 2nd annual bikers covid festival Sturgis? Assuming still since gritty Gov Noem still us. Less 1,200 fully vaccinated Americans died. I'd say great job.  % United Kingdom least one vaccine dose: 88.5% Missouri &amp; Florida least one vaccine dose: &amp; think they're exactly comparable. Americans brightest humans planet, clearly. win Small Brain Award day   They've already rolled Israel Fauci made comments day make pretty obvious eventually coming USA. 

I went today received 3rd dose Pfizer. Might well shots readily available. Best time plant tree‚Ä¶ million tourists coming Florida every week. pandemic daily headlines hospitals capacity soaring infection rates.

My kids focused scored better tests ever before. also super tight siblings.

That's like saying big TV's wealthy, yet drive trailer park 70"" every living room. would imagine demographic chillin Provincetown \*is\* vaccinated. Ya, really want people die even get really sick they're currently making bad decision. want change mind get vaccinated asap. Masks much virus infectious. wonders flu (R0 1.2). Thanks thoughtful reply. disagree.

As others pointed out, actual cases far 10%. Far far more. Last summer seroprevalence studies measured 30% numerous hard hit cities.

If delta indicator *could* happen it‚Äôs indicator spread quickly easily. There‚Äôs indicator turn less deadly. There‚Äôs chance, there‚Äôs always chance.

Finally, Spanish Flu says hi. burned bright, killed lot people, disappeared reasons one understands. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs intellectually dishonest think coronavirus share many, all, properties coronaviruses.

After unvaccinated died course ... God. Months what? There's neurological effects possible lots common illnesses, common possible? 

I actually neurological effects 10, 11 years later bronchitis infection, severely impacted life sucks preventing anything fear could happen again. mean numbers going go up, state fair state fair think unfortunate thing masks there‚Äôs almost emphasis effective masks (KF94, KN95, NIOSH N95/N100). height pandemic there‚Äôs shortage right walk Home Depot find wall NIOSH disposable respirators $1 piece. Especially given transmissible Delta appears be, think messaging around good masks needs improve. 


But Regeneron definitely great move. acts almost instantly, provides several weeks prophylaxis per treatment too. Heck kind instant response deal anti vaxxers suddenly regret getting sick. It‚Äôs sad people exist also putting everyone risk.  Man I'd impressed DIDNT get covid event would suitable epidemiological scale. per-person-false-positive rate would pose problem, less people actually infected - would scenario aiming for! I'm Canada. data showing something like sub 5% breakthrough cases vaccinated individuals last checked. right, data place. gate crashed. Yes are.

My ex father law 39yr, healthy, vaccinated got sick week ago( itchy throat slight cough), tested positive covid-19. Thought nothing it, 24 hours ago woke breathing challenges middle night, went hospital ambulance vented right little chance making 8t weekend.

I'm gathering children right summer custody mother coming get let know Grandpa Thomas dying.....39 healthy active guy takes vitamins vaccinated.

All vaccinated. solution ü§î US intelligence community consider utilizing social media disrupt misinformation disinformation targeting anti-vaxxers positive information vaccines.

The pandemic prolonged nature virus yet come terms fact moving pandemic phase endemic phase (in retrospect, entirely inevitable outcome). eradicate virus (it circulates animals that's impossible), spread unbounded fashion whenever population totally locked down. Fortunately, vaccination prevents health civic duty help understand civic responsibility get heads ""personal responsibility"" butts

Otherwise people may think prior high 4,052? Yeah reality check, rapid tests, incidence-10-per-100k-per-week setting, test day 0.2% false-positive rate (which have), 6% chance per month self-isolate 10 days. I'm family 4, that's like 20%.

The probability positive result wrong 98.5% setting. 200 people self-isolating, 197 would reason all.

This strategy works. tests answer question ""is person symptomps ill COVID something else"". suitable screening. though? 10x pretty significant millions people getting covid. pick worst numbers possibly find going worried. IIRC even week pretty significant immune response recorded. 100%, something think people exaggerating protection hospitalization bit infected.

Yes, fretting many people died last year without vaccines talking vaccine efficacy ridiculous. Delta could severity, vaccinated younger people getting infected, they're milder case it, means think might cold something else get tested. think article said seeing many young people coming hospital extrapolating estimate based that. think that‚Äôs good enough.

Seeing many people world actually want vaccinated, really case. Furthermore, problem US government coddling people instead rewarding vaccinated, basically they've summer. supermarket day father two young daughters walking around store time. three masks on, kids lively chatty would without them.

Shame many people use kids hide insecurities paranoia masking up. changes mind week two Israel....

Masks longer needed says CDC, israel cautious... Oops, masks needed indoors again...

Booster shot needed says CDC today, I'll see week two one.... probably weren‚Äôt enough COVID cases placebo group kids don‚Äôt catch easily, would make sense expand pool patients even true, Florida still worse states considered pretty bad, one paying attention numbers anymore.

Now everyone's actually paying attention they're like ""Oh Florida's shitty"" that's change. Sure, stated Australia, America - Yeah I'd 100% narc someone  Bases numbers 1/4 unvax got infected 1/5 unvax went hospital unvax 4 would gone hospital zero would died Might make decent pro-vaccine ads: ""Hey, communists Vietnam trying keep people getting vaccinated!

Also, covid-19 invisible easily spreads covertly since manifests cold nothing significant portion population. Smallpox obvious symptoms asymptomatic spread. rash = contagious. get smallpox, *you get smallpox.* much easier quarantine. 

Also, even idiots took smallpox seriously outrageously deadly. Like wipe entire families destroy villages deadly. Covid-19 deadly disruptive overall fast spreads, vast majority people still survive it, lot harder get everyone board eradicating (as we're seeing).

We're still muddling along along edges life expectancy plummets. US government totally ineffectual. Came say this. Correct sir. school districts website says follow CDC recommended AAP guidelines, hyperlinked guidelines. Basically telling students wear masks without saying wear mask.

**SIGH** Please, try understand science here.

After weeks second injection, **no physical substance** - literally substance, atoms sort meaningful configuration related vaccine inside body.

How, then, would side effect happen, mechanistically?

Please, think this.

The Pfizer vaccine 4 fats, 4 salts, 1 sugar, mRNA.

Within days, 4 fats, 4 salts, 1 sugar mRNA used fallen apart. caused proteins created, body destroys immune response.

Once process done - what, conceivable, possible thing exists body, cause side effect?

Like physical substance, please, point out.

With hormones above, **constant** physical presence inside body.

With smoking, due constant usage caused issue (think - smoke ONE cigarette, one cigarette entire life, going get emphysema that)

It due accumulation effect, physical substance.

With vaccine, **is physical substance** days.

You've got secondary effects afterwards last weeks, mostly related immune system.

And done? There's nothing. Literally nothing might cause problem.

Again, think mechanistically. Let's say got second dose Pfizer today.

What possible, conceivable substance inside body year could cause side effect? Like really, think - EXISTS inside could that?

Nothing. Literally nothing.

Every example given far substance take time, accumulation damage (or side effect). None ""taken twice, 3 years later massive side effect showed up"" - happen.

Ever.

It impossible, physically, happen.

It would literally disprove physics happen you. Anything else would stupid. feel people can‚Äôt vaccinated real medical reasons, I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôll way make exception always since start?

Most people think people giving 'correct' answer reality saying see 50% wearing masks. mean ‚Äúasymptomatic transmission‚Äù?

What definitely isn‚Äôt true? science isn‚Äôt understood - is, way, number studies vaccines‚Äô efficacy delta - hardly justify taking strong stance, you? Also kissing asses base forget many people died snow storm. Look bud, spend bunch time counting duckets worrying becoming vegetable Canada. America made choice going back regular life come hell high water. fellow nerds North you. great weekend.   need wear mask seals better around nose. I‚Äôve worn mask glasses 8 hours day every work day pretty much entire last year I‚Äôve never bad fogging issue New Orleans pediatric ICUs full. know past serious hospitalization risk rare, 'pediatric ICUs full' sound like 'rare' anymore.

The leaked CDC report says vaxxed adults getting sick covid likely spread it. end hospitals. whole mask ban nonsense states stupid. mean, getting 20K fine forced quarantine GTFO seems like would prevent people unless there's kink travel plans cancelled border may lead people postponing decision hospitalize oxygenate could contribute worse outcomes. wouldn‚Äôt see effect immediately. Oh, worries understand then. wish right hope graph SOON is. 1k cases day months hit 1K cases day last 4 days week. I'm thankful state fairly highly vaxxed Governor leaving masks personal choice. LPT healthcare worker. Get mask metal rigid plastic reinforcement top. seals well around nose get fogging glasses. thank vaccinated. damn! thanks sharing article. Probably. I‚Äôm still hiding youngest gets vaccinated. He‚Äôs jealous older sibling. NYC hit even functional tests available yet. 7-day moving average already slowed sharply terms daily percent change. lot things federal government could well states run GOP shitheads wouldn‚Äôt able get way of. vax gets full FDA approval, institute mandatory vaccinations federal employees &amp; contractors. Require enter military base airport.

There certainly financial carrots sticks, disallowing people luxury employment air travel twist arms properly. someone else worried, wear N95! That‚Äôs I‚Äôm saying. get tested roughly every 6 weeks, symptoms. I‚Äôm it. I‚Äôm vaccinated. I‚Äôm healthy. you‚Äôre worried, risk, wear N95? Leave though, can‚Äôt work mask on, I‚Äôll seriously get heat exhaustion rules travelers broke I'm pretty sure even apply Americans yet

That's irrelevant considering broke Canadian law Canadian soil. know they're American, they're exempt Canadian law Hiking, swimming, paddle boarding, wineries, mountain bike trails, rock climbing, disc golf, golf, live music, tons events, capital (since big buildings history seems thing). I'm saying cities do, Austin plenty besides bars. guess really lack churches look at. tweet supposed looking there?

I worried hospitalization, worried long covid, something like ~10% infections (depending define it). One study nurses showed vaccine reduce rates long covid compared unvaxxed. different study today suggested vaccine halves chance long covid. No, it‚Äôs emotions. I‚Äôm telling straight out, want hear thought process behind every governor‚Äôs decision making. want know much knew time, even reality. 45 tape talking lot things people came know late summer. Mask mandates never meant prevent transmission. reduce it. virus going spread regardless policies put place. 

This nothing emotion. bias? Yeah, absolutely, I‚Äôm willing admit that. governors intent behind factors great deal accessing situation. 

You mold facts, numbers, perspectives mean anything right argument. doesn‚Äôt mean don‚Äôt matter, do. Covid affects areas people differently. It‚Äôs completely unpredictable. 

There‚Äôs many layers this. 

But that‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs answer. wanted give one. *this* summer, agree OP No, definitely isn‚Äôt true, especially asymptotic transmission isn‚Äôt actively measured. science difficult understand, listen experts rather trying form opinions. Boo$ter $hot$ renters need pay back payments, government? makes sweet that? People like surprised Pikachu nothing limit spread end deadlier mutations OG vaccine can't handle. read claim earlier today. dumbfounded. Ignorance side racism. Dangerous. could cause someone else become sick, reason suspect someone else could cause become sick, yes. going around general, no. wear glasses, ambient temperature cool enough inside places they'll fog up. went Chrysanthemum Festival October last year wipe lenses every five minutes.

And (more pressingly) already waited year half vaccine. everything right. going back lockdown mode people can't bothered help pisses off. I'll throw mask I'm around children they're defenseless this. sympathy adults though. family member house vaccinated, others aren't, kids can't get vaccinated yet even risk factors vaccinated people autoimmune issues. fully vaccinated family member house recently came home sick (quite symptomatic) delta variant believe described reckless behavior, that's ok. think that's hardest part.....it's respectful, considerate, etc. treated poorly want kid distance pandemic feel safe home since started others care bring home.

Otherwise agree you. long callousness conspiracy theories play. People different perspectives risk tolerance yes there's lot nuance that. referring groups though...those truly believe pandemic (was?) conspiracies various kinds. sure downvoted, legitimate conversation legitimate concern. It‚Äôs pretty much ironclad, universal consensus among experts actually. 

Except small number loonies there. Meanwhile, town Massachusetts nearly 900 cases outbreak seven people hospitalized. administration offered door door campaign states trouble weeks ago governors refused. can't help want helped. Supermarkets near today 90 would estimate Masks seem protect colds stomach bugs Doubt it. People likely self quarantining wearing masks. Plus may spreading fast temporarily burned path. think downward trend continue. think trend back UK. may end seeing zig zag upward keeps burning path forward. even need test things Germany right now? looked example homepage big cinema chain lot cinemas Germany. handful require vaccinated, tested recently recovered Covid moment. 

All federal states different rules rules vary also many people currently coronavirus. 

In NRW example, populous federal state Germany, test obligation unvaccinated restaurants corona numbers low restaurants keep tables apart. 

So short live really comfortable right unvaccinated person places Germany infection numbers still low enough though rising. 

Making tests cost something useful pressure people get vaccinated, corona numbers higher. Otherwise unvaccinated people often get tested. spent way long reading first Austrian word realizing English. Dumb American brain moment haha. vaccinated person giving good career opportunities Covid fears. Fights low-spread environments even vaccines. Oh. do.

Shit. 3 weeks Delta, rose 6 weeks UK starting fall.

Do think falling 6 weeks? Well dont vaccination rate Uk so...

If arent older risk factors wear N95, low-mid risk. less severe. politician actively blocking science, political. Science says wear mask governor using executive order block suing. Agreed, really need stop stigmatizing people late vaccination party. beed encourage dissuade. go get vaccine whenever available them?


No one needs know. probably matter anyway. Disney wants 90%+ vaccinated brag potential guests, 40-60% already vaccinated matter. still would want rest vaccinated. Oh dear What's wrong wearing mask? know uncomfortable, yes personally would prefer wear one is.   bummed! worried. outdoor venue, know we're probably gonna get sick. 

I think Delta Variant dangerous vaccinated people need feel way. problem (as understand it) still easily transmissible unvaccinated people vaccinated people way Original Flavor COVID didn't. vaccinated people significantly less likely catch Delta, significantly less likely spread whole. It‚Äôs particularly difficult interpret. 

Think may arguing position never took. don‚Äôt anything vaccine mandates. I‚Äôm enormously pro-vaccine. Japan's vaccination rate super low though. 1/4 adults fully vaccinated. Assuming survived ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs how‚Äù Republican state. check UK data. you‚Äôre vaccinated- you‚Äôre incredibly transition period virus becoming endemic highly vaccinated areas. Cases become white noise soon enough hospitals overwhelmed. Especially vaccinated that‚Äôs number matters Losers. Big TV's expensive anymore.

CDC told vaccinated test asymptomatic. would backfire usa people would stop getting tested.  None talk spread‚Ä¶seems like you‚Äôre hard time interpreting science. vaccines offer functional rather sterilizing immunity, viral spread cannot stopped herd immunity reached. COVID-19 seems part class viruses. Vaccine mandates way out. booked flight Chicago three weeks ago September. pretty much hope going go through, museums tickets let us without masks.

Shhh ok, I'm sorry. going safe... reason worry. listen cdc says stay fuzzy warm happy place (: Yeah makes sense actually, put like that. Getting doses October means people need start getting shots next weeks, unless procrastinate get J&amp;J. mRNA I'd wager. people‚Äôs responsibility make RIGHT decision? choices impact people around us. Whether someone chooses right thing could potentially difference whether another person lives dies. don‚Äôt know you‚Äôve gone year half pandemic isn‚Äôt clear yet. Upper-middle class white people? Which, believe, group higher vaccination rates. understand pandemic started one infection right? over. ebbs flows. Luckily live expanded Medicaid state. definitely something I'm afraid of. 

When younger significant life-threatening heart problems, afford lose employment health insurance comprehensive, know job incredibly stressing exacerbated problem much more. thought every day time going pass away could find another job get there. unfortunately reality many. I've back June last year. appears opposite. nearly 10-fold less likely catch it, severity reduced small factor. sympathize kids, necessarily father. unfortunate, fact ground vaccinated people mostly protected, vectors killing vaccinated people.

bloodless civil war. I'd really need laminated vaccine card something paper. water, rain, sweat, etc day Disney brings want risk destroying paper.

I really wish better system easily provide proof vaccination. UK donating AZ vaccines. Great headline, guess, unfortunately worst vaccine stock. 

The 8 weeks turned sweet spot long UK decided stretch interval shots, people could get first shot (which seemed work OK Delta came along). shortage Pfizer vaccines forced hand, basically. 

The UK gambled got lucky times, lucky occasions. spin trying put unnecessary.  It‚Äôs stumbling block. Faking IDs simple enough do, still require one buy alcohol. Many people won‚Äôt undertake effort break rules rule place. media headlines really make sound way. (Clicks! need clicks!) 

The NYT headline Twitter morning *awful.* worse news half Israelis want booster. Imagine % usa countries. work implemented mask mandate boss still comes around fucking touches peoples thing. Also people! hair! Pats shoulder etc. get you‚Äôre friendly must touch people laugh it‚Äôs covid. Also outbreak 3rd floor office building. whole floor sent home. Everyone else stay- even though al share break room, bathrooms etc 3rd floor. Also people visit office! Remember vaccinated people nearly 90% less likely infected. get vaccine useless? Lol yeah, *soo* good lol Passing around viral loads seems. Iam double vexed still wears mask stores people starting give funny looks. even know why? much small subset. amount time effort people sub spent trying diminish rightful concerns others, shaming us wearing masks concerned... scary shit. Florida man keeps claiming know doing, sure seem like does. position topic breakthrough cases inseparable topic whether vaccines ""excellent preventing death/hospitalization/severe covid"". welcome disagree please accuse deliberately unintentionally obfuscating. Korona-Mart add counter point this, put situations could make get infected. Death &amp; Hospitalization outcome COVID-19. countless long-term impacts we're recently starting scratch surface of.

e.g. try avoid getting sick much possible. However get sick, keep calm stressed. feel bad family left behind, that‚Äôs extent it. downvotes prove point exactly

Since point there's downside living CA NY compared Texas, votes Reddit fact nothing point. I'm inclined agree based what's report. Maybe could reduce immunity enough susceptible breakthroughs, reduced enough significantly increase risk hospitalization/death. 

So many unknowns still. Looking forward additional research this, since PrEP increasingly common treatment prescribed people risk contracting HIV. recently started treatment well! think realistically masks forever? Actually, great news. Pfizer 96% effective hospitalisations two doses. Irish strategy focused this. vaccinated associating vaccinated, vaccine passports becoming popular countries.  Sheesh. going watch town halls. torn whether commend condemn governor, saying. saying week even vaccine level virus unvaccinated person.

They said since day 1, vaccinated people necessarily unable transmit/shed virus.

Just pay attention media covering more, mean information widely available pulled J&amp;J one

Stop ""they."" Read tests studies done vaccines, instead 2nd/3rd hand accounts them. brush statistics. likely die lightning strike WEEK die J&amp;J important get shot

To help MITIGATE spread, lowering % chance dumb ass winding hospital burdens society, lowering % chance virus mutates strain can't stop wipes f get Covid level unvaxxed person, benefit pertains stopping spread?

Ok, again, brush statistics.

If wear seat belt, still get dismembered much someone without seat belt.

The point play large numbers, say country 350 million people, DRASTICALLY reduce spread, severe disease, chance mutation.

So yes, might still die COVID (though likelyhood still significantly lower unvaxxed), mean rest population will.

Beyond shadow doubt, population 100 vaccinated people vs unvaccinated people, know facts:

- Significantly fewer deaths/disease among vaxxed
- Less spread among vaxxed
- asymptomatic cases among vaxxed
- Fewer instances ""long covid"" among vaxxed

These indisputable facts.

Note point ""they"" claim vaccinated guarantees covid, ever, circumstance.

FFS vaccines came gate running ""94% effective best, questionable efficacy possible need boosters comes variants.""

Even back April 2020, discussing reality vaccine. got China stopping it. bad, really bad live area high vaccine uptake. province, 0.7% cases among fully vaccinated people. Overall vax rates taken account. higher uptake lower overall spread Israel UK allowing vaccinated populations gain sense normalcy vaccine passports less restrictions vaccinated, US seems hellbent letting willfully unvaccinated operate however please.

If that's US keeps choosing handle this, yes, screwed. UK testing massively widely available, including instant tests free order online. Pick pharmacy, given employers. Many people take vaccinated, want isolate. think behaviours changing move forward too. guess deaths way see going moving forward mom works Walmart. They‚Äôre converting store ‚Äúwarehouse‚Äù store anticipation pickup delivery future. People still come inside, apparently thought longer default. 

I‚Äôm sure loss leader concept dead. Pickup/delivery still allows chucking extra stuff cart via app/site surfacing recommended items things ordered past. They‚Äôve certainly gotten way.

Honestly services gotten shop Walmart far often used to, crazy parking lot massive crowded store anxiety-inducing me. parking lot someone drops stuff trunk. still prefer get fresh fruits, veg meats elsewhere, it‚Äôs great stock everything else savings means shop local organic grocery fresh items instead regular grocery store, pricey great quality. know... hell expectation completely change? thought we'd ""lucky"" shown prevent transmission? According [town almost entire population Provincetown 12 years old vaccinated.

Sounds like maybe it‚Äôs hard around yourself. 

Best luck. Herman Cain did! died twitter account continued tweet covid denial crap. interpreting poster said quite different ways. 
I actually even asking sympathy - fact, nothing bad even happened aside tough decision spot like many others. 
I understand digging worst potential outcome one look statistics unlikely. 
However, unlikely mean impossible. 
I think quite harsh callous say ‚Äúnot many kids die / affected rest lives.‚Äù 

If letting ‚Äúfear‚Äù control I‚Äôd told kids today new case figures released would giving camp. 
Instead attend, although cases doubled, specific county / tract still quite well point shutting things down. 
A month today certainly different place though. Florida. ""70% COVID-19 infections Mecklenburg County (NC) fully vaccinated people"" title really different? another dumb ""template"" news media everywhere now. dumb pointless ""44 Percent California's New Coronavirus Cases People 35"" Oh high male infection nothing worried It‚Äôs sounding like it. articles saying vaccinated people carry viral load infectious non-vaccinated. vaccinated people less severe symptoms infected. Oh daaaaaaamn. one hurt way LA. Ohio, also reporting ‚Äúduty‚Äù. Red, white, stupid. pretty big difference versus alpha (where viral load 75-95% lower within 2 weeks first dose), mRNA vaccines still prevent nearly 90% infections. Yes. residents 100% vaccination rate. Agreed, rest country needs agree it‚Äôs right thing it.  Black people... thought republicans supposed pissed at.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  i‚Äôm currently breakthrough covid case. posted different social media site symptoms much worse may without vaccine. encouraged people go get first dose today! hate covid, i‚Äôm glad experience vaccinated actually helped people decide get vaccinated! Numbers like ""19% vaccinated people developing long term symptoms"" sound really alarming, base rate people even getting COVID quite small. 

I much agree remember data January April. pre-Delta, weekly talk news about. 3% consistent ""97% efficacy"" linked PHE. Breakthrough clusters among vaccinated people really thing pre-Delta. 
 
But breakthrough clusters thing. main point above, Rt near 1 among vaccinated people, time start thinking severity disease among vaccinated people. even concern *hard* vaccinated people got previously, case rate vaccinated people low. That's point here. 
But know vaccine entirely stop spread own, look kind damage bodies. 
 
Further thet attitude younger people relax fine thing say, often suggests young people worry virus *and go whatever want do*. know saying lack concern nearly equivalent exposure. attitude lot anti-maskers saying start: ""young people hurt basically - let er rip!"" 
Which, statistically mostly true still ignores point young people vectors perpetuating virus. 
 
There two main reasons want contract disease: 1) health 2a) give others 2b) gave give others give others give others ultimately infect hundreds thousands people months later. responsible infected ""patient zero"". 
That 2) really matter vaccinated effectively stopping chain transmission ~97% efficacy. Rt ~1, that's something need worry about. Africa entire continent, country. cape cod situation, majority vaxxed individuals symptoms. That's definition 'vaccine hesitant.' Yep cdc getting worse worse this. news nowadays onslaught. really try understand bad things happen good people. 



But there‚Äôs point culling needs happen. bring people say. feel bad finding sympathy, holy shit‚Ä¶.



You listen easily posted conspiracy theories without digging deeper funded science I‚Äôm sorry (and families) bad luck. Can‚Äôt feel much else campaign advisors telling Presidential campaign? Risk lives educated professionals? Awesome! grew upstate area visited western NY lot. get nice weather summer rest year find hard take. Love people though! work get insurance, get covid sick long longer employed lose insurance? what? I'm serious, think do? 

If asymptomatic people successfully spreading delta everyone come contact nobody getting sick enough go hospital, I'm sure options masking and/or locking forever think pretty clear endemic virus. 

There's billions unvaccinated people world continue many years. them? Keep away vaccinated? 

To me, important things right U.S. 1) Track give hard numbers breakthrough cases lead hospitalization. granular better people anti-vax areas take one look county go, ""Holy shit, 90% people hospitalized vaccinated. Maybe I'll take chances J&amp;J single dose mRNA vaccine."" know small chance, better chance constantly flashing ""Vaccines mean squat, still mask distance cause VARIANTS."" 

Anyone thinks five seconds realize going YEARS, lifetime dealing variants. 

The 2nd important thing watch #'s unvaccinated children becoming hospitalized infection. would pretty good indicator mutation, especially occurs areas high vaccination rates. 

We need look-out signs booster needed (which we're getting now) signs masks schools even remote schooling option kids become vaccinated. 

Other that, I'm sure else country get people vaccinated, stay right side fo messaging (you way less likely DIE, example, headline afterthought end every article), also help poorer countries get dosed. engage multiple fronts really care variants, people getting dosed everywhere matter. Boosters reason tracking breakthroughs, overall positive #'s. vaccines, high positive #'s tell us nothing without context. agree sad story. Needless, pointless death misery never happy. 

As individual, welcome see pathetic, powerless victim people's deceit wish. true. Even knew that--his text wife (""I gotten damn vaccine"" whatever was) failure, failures others. Math little Rt trends....

If precautions vaccinations CA RIGHT vs. situation FL RIGHT mattered great deal, CA Rt 1.74 rising FL Rt 1.41 falling? 

Infection level function Rt. Rt obviously higher past get case rate Florida. Rt lower past achieve case rate CA. I'm sure masses unvaccinated people abiding honor system also help

CDC made horrible decision anyone could foreseen Walmart, largest U.S. employer, simply eat anti-vaxers? Nope. MRNA fairly new. isn‚Äôt studies compare traditional vs MRNA, already know this. common sense. regularly update MRNA, think update patch notes new variants. young, also might diagnosed something aware of. every condition symptoms. Lots diabetes type II people ignorant of. biggest takeaway rise delta variant vaccinated people far less likely hospitalized. really understand logic behind anti-vaxers anti-maskers celebrating fact vaccinated people also transmit virus sort ""win"". means people risk ever.

I fully vaccinated since March unborn child. believe vaccines importance.

BUT really understand anyone thinks way convince someone vaccine-hesitant using curse words, spewing vitriol, claiming they're reason new variants (this complete lie). makes people hesitant get vaccinated. 

The behavior mind boggingly childish sometimes wonder reddit filled bunch teenagers. Exactly. ‚ÄúOld normal‚Äù little away. Lots downvoters little salty that. 

I too, face reality. didn‚Äôt test passengers, don‚Äôt know many asymptomatic cases among vaccinated.

Rigid masks like N95 KN95 touch skin smaller area cloth surgical masks. Someone please give reason despair might sound kinda dumb maybe there's less vaccinated people stated. know I'm guessing. Lose weight thought too, chart lists something like ""breakthroughs reported"" bottom, also tiny number. reading whole webpage there, ""Each vaccine breakthrough case reviewed subject matter expert matched vaccination data Virginia Immunization Information System. takes extra time may delay reporting cases dashboard.""

Maybe many VA people actually vaccinated DC MD? expect number high though, could wrong. Yeah agree. much despise anti-vaxxers, CDC favors admitting lied beginning masks wouldn‚Äôt hoarded whatever. really fucked credibility, IMO. seems like me, though don‚Äôt know ulterior motive yet. every time happens gives antivaxxers confirmation bias. Agree said, think issue something like /r/politics utter cesspool 1-sided opinions it‚Äôs close impossible political debate. Plus, comments posted post (which, post part, upvoted says sort pandering topic) don‚Äôt even comment anything article says disagreeing. legal standpoint sue-happy society, companies, private colleges, etc. infinitely easier time defending court mandate fully approved vaccine versus one approved EUA. number firms specializing corporate law advising companies wait issuing mandates vaccines undergo final approval. 

I completely agree we‚Äôre well past point vaccines considered experimental. vaccines safe, they‚Äôre extremely studied, personally think FDA needs get asses approve them. insurance standpoint legal standpoint, vaccine drug reaches final approval, they‚Äôre still classed experimental. tested positive covid. can't work 10 days now. suppose go get paid? live California.

I think earlier counties may hopefully coming down. Linn outbreak. Taney peak. interesting....didnt know sk that, thx sharing. Based wider CDC study seems like outlier though. really concerned?  Delta don‚Äôt care 1/1250, curious. One thing consider given high prevalence vaccination higher likelihood asymptomatic, numbers 'breakthrough' infections actually reported people know get tested. Also % people hospitalized could stated vaccination group similar reason. pool asymptomatic vaccinated individuals may really big know. Great observation!

Since clearly testing, different rate breakthrough infections VA, means either they're 1) picking asymptomatic infections via mandated testing work/school; 2) people willing get tested blue-er state like sniffles; 3) cases symptomatic. 

(3) Seems unlikely. (2) I'm sure about, know many seropositive people came ""with cold"" think get tested they're vaxxed following old CDC guideines.

Hopefully, third dose booster, able curb transmission well. likely possibility. But, can‚Äôt get third dose haven‚Äôt first second dose.

More importantly, getting vaccinated *does* protect people around you, even doesn‚Äôt effectively curb transmission. less people hospitalized, less strain healthcare institutions, less burnout among healthcare workers, less cancelling ‚Äúelective‚Äù medical procedures like cardiology appointments cancer screenings, etc. anyone aware studies whether previously infected people also carry much virus? wondering would compare figures.  matters means potentially millions people spreading thinking safe around vulnerable. god choosing doesn‚Äôt get covid ? based offerings church , sins something else make sense health perspective make staff wear masks, customers. business perspective makes sense, health perspective.

They'll put lot abuse work low wages job offers insurance, even crappy. People stay horrible jobs rock boat kids support. We've witnessed it. Hell, describes half people know!

And powers want it. us Texas! babies start school soon ‚Ä¶7 8 years old I‚Äôm terrified! Vaccine mandates much useful never ending mask mandates Thank answering question! feel bad them. didn‚Äôt before. However it‚Äôs fault, fed misinformation misinformation. education system sucks can‚Äôt fault taking information trusting person sounded smart. Plus half elected officials country reinforcing creating misinformation. long term impacts still researched.

Correct, data suggest Covid19 behave like respiratory virus known coronavirus. Thank answering question! Hah J&amp;J people better sneezing immunity point.  Ummm
 floridahhhh lead red tide ron disaster Florida Man thing sure took dark turn. realize head office right, people working stores warehouses etc....? hurricanes, flooding, fires, burst water pipes, stableish energy grid. sound like much nightmare compared staying.

I guess could freeze death decide sleep outside winter, that'd choice. dropped /s always chance cases falling substantially well. Umatilla County Jackson County cases Multnomah county fractions size Multnomah County. scary. Thats whole point. tested willing take right now. high risk take it.

But we'll need atleast one year tested. Thanks pointing out. seems obvious , even think massive amounts people asymptomatic mildly ill. vaccinated people? vaccines also major blockade severe illness, far likely result long-term effects, well death. saw that! makes sense whatsoever me, I‚Äôm willing put faith luck nowadays don‚Äôt much else going us. Poor medical workers especially need damn break. I‚Äôm worried health care workforce going hit breaking point push another winter like this. 60% vaccinated. UK India started dropping within around 6 weeks uptick. UK case study one go of, Missouri dropping within next week two.

Many people (Inc. OP) pointing UK example say delta work. Missouri show that's true not. True. think they‚Äôre still town long enough positive case recorded New Orleans hospitalized there?

Yes, it‚Äôs possible least extent. Six trips cross country New Orleans, never less week, Delta‚Äôs symptoms typically showing 4 days exposure. moves faster original virus. agree cases brought outside area likely spreading locals, tourists end hospitalized back home.

Horrifying see happening (again) one favorite places world. really immunologist? furry profile picture? That‚Äôs still significant difference. Expect MO FL worse right? Thankfully you‚Äôre asking won‚Äôt happen. abrupt, blunt-force measures resolve this. acceptance general public catching Covid point. get vaccinated you‚Äôre risk, stay cautious you‚Äôre vulnerable, stay positive, all. Sort dark thing say, point EMS workers, nurses, doctors start throwing hands air start saying longer make non-vaccinated people priority? going burn already there. know caring, basic human instincts dictate help fellow man matter what, it‚Äôs got completely frustrating constantly responding people made decision get vaccinated. feel men women tirelessly work help ignored reality. Oh alright, well dad poor health perhaps traveling regardless. go super worried Covid. vaccinated, remember that. cases ""less likely"" might mean intimidated so. true! didn‚Äôt consider that. seen study alone, vaccines keeping people dying. want stop people dying all, going stop transmission lot things COVID. stupid humans probably didn‚Äôt make far beginning. Sabre tooth tigers all. However‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶the smart decent humans developed mechanisms let stupid live longer. Therefore stupid humans able reproduce. 

And smart decent humans kept inventing ways keep stupid humans alive. 

And are. I‚Äôve Reading last two weeks mask use disappeared pretty much overnight well freedom day came around. doesn‚Äôt surprise people refused wear masks start mandated.  bode well highly vaccinated populations though. Compared lowly vaccinated ones struggling hospital capacity. Could add 2 Gs make 5G really piss conspiracy people? fallacy headline:
1. ""some"" equal ""all"" 
2. ""can"" equal ""do"" 
3. Even ""do"" equal ""with infectious viability."" 

Great thread epidemiologist cited response 

Can vaccinated people get COVID? yes, knew day heard ""95%"" Alpha. pass COVID on? Yes, course. subset infected, vaccinated people infect forward frequently effectively unvaccinated people? Unlikely. average, get sick? No. pandemic over? No. Delta mean back March 2020? No. Even - - future escape variant evolves, knowledge infrastructure around mRNA vaccines forever different. 

Personally I've started masking public, think that's prudent. But, study (with N 127 vaxed) says - ""data report insufficient draw conclusions effectiveness COVID-19 vaccines SARS-CoV-2, including Delta variant, outbreak."" Source: True - state make hard conclusively say CFR observed UK delta outbreak reflective actual CFR variant. 

But let‚Äôs look India - delta outbreak (which first COVID wave country - benefit ppl infected natural antibody) CFR 1.3% - similar UK figures, drastically lower alpha original strains. mention India doesn‚Äôt exactly best medical services.

I‚Äôm saying take seriously media seems conveniently ignoring causing everyone panic Yes...vaccinated individuals, *in unlikely event get breakthrough infections,* carry similar viral loads unvaccinated individuals. doesn‚Äôt contradict said lmao. believe I‚Äôve already said thread. 

On whole, vaccinated individuals remain less likely transmit disease less likely catch first place. catch it, likely transmit largely hinges whether individuals around vaccinated.

Be little less smug others‚Äô abilities interpret data it‚Äôs something seem struggle mightily with.

By way, source I‚Äôm quoting **is July 27th update** source refers. True, amout protection still robust 6 months make difference  really. You‚Äôre talking circles judging politicians strictly COVID outcomes strictly lens NPIs (which conclusive scientific evidence establishing efficacy) ignoring population level observational data said NPIs show effective. There‚Äôs nothing else say besides that. 1. actual infection rate higher, covid-19 infection necessarily promise immunity - seems Delta reinfect people previous infections relative ease. There's absolutely statistical data outwardly states nearing threshold, lot recent sources seem express doubt herd immunity even achievable.
2. Spanish Flu coronavirus. DNA RNA viruses quite different, even amongst RNA viruses, coronaviruses pretty unique unto themselves. actually looked differences prior coronavirus pandemics current one, pretty evident covid-19 unlike predecessors -- disimilar enough say likely vanish. yeah, I'd say intellectually dishonest. Ligma balls mean altogether pointless limit mega gatherings though short local hospital capacity issue. get vaccinated infected today, time future, end going happen one way advantage delaying it? think lower uptake would weight tilt balance direction. agree not, honest I‚Äôm sure would react vote given choice. 

I value privacy also value expectations common good. issue draw line draws line hidden agenda well lifted privacy and‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs privacy. 

It‚Äôs sensitive subject. Obviously they're exempt Canadian law. sure saying me. People referring American citizens. point necessarily.  makes perfect sense considering vaccines still effective prevent hospitalization death. fuck We‚Äôre two metrics justification Cuomo ‚Äúgood job‚Äù? Ah ok. thought additional ones official test sites coat something. Could perhaps adjustment wavelengths used improve accuracy? EU, entrance events requires vaccination testing. don‚Äôt get tested don‚Äôt go crowded public places.. much good news town (if it‚Äôs even true), it‚Äôs indicative what‚Äôs going country large. Can‚Äôt explained though NY strong restrictions fall, really‚Ä¶isn‚Äôt? **At least** one test per week free according Bundestestverordnung. take one every day test capacities permit it. ""The findings come continuation large clinical trial began last summer, include period delta variant emerged become dominant."" would honestly love that- works multiple ways- 1, makes people get vaccine want go places, 2, keeps people refuse get vaccinated places. starting finally anxiety pandemic it‚Äôs mounting again. Maybe unvaccinated spending much time close proximity others vaccinated were. 

Big difference exposure level hooking half hour one person, compared orgy goes hours dozen people.  last year's school season go Florida? in-school learning then, too, right? Depends get vaccine 'antigen fragment' vaccine shit, hardly tested, seems randomly substituted sometimes. Studies UK Canada showed great protection time frame two Pfizer shots.

Can't tell sure long lasts government keeping track that, let us know dad needs booster shot. 80 - 90% North Yorkshire I've seen. Clearly compliance varies pretty hugely region. well put. still met anyone refuses vaccinated hope I'd able explain things way ever do. soon fully approved, I'm going require employees get it.  We're already 86% vaccinated, I've got good, long-time people unvaccinated group.  Ah well.  ""I'd hate lose you, get vaccine get fuck out."" 
 
I'm fucking tired unvaccinated assholes fucking rest us. They‚Äôve literally blocked vaccines shipments getting Palestine. I‚Äôm willing honest conversation you. Want private chat? Nah, info old.

See Rochelle Walensky‚Äôs statement yesterday: July 27th, CDC updated guidance fully vaccinated people, recommending everyone wear mask indoor public settings areas substantial high transmission, regardless vaccination status. decision made data science available CDC time, including valuable public health partnership resulting rapid receipt review unpublished data published CDC‚Äôs Morbidity Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), demonstrating Delta infection resulted similarly high SARS-CoV-2 viral loads vaccinated unvaccinated people. High viral loads suggest increased risk transmission raised concern that, unlike variants, vaccinated people infected Delta transmit virus. finding concerning pivotal discovery leading CDC‚Äôs updated mask recommendation. masking recommendation updated ensure vaccinated public would unknowingly transmit virus others, including unvaccinated immunocompromised loved Fairness wouldnt imagine changes much ripping schools months. clarify maybe ""fear mongering"" bad expression:

The CDC announcement likely good motivate people get vaccination

However, leave large variable unlike people experience USA daily even lifetime basis. I‚Äôm boosters approved emergency use! Gonna let clinical trials play first haha got anti-fog spray cheap Amazon works surprisingly well. reference, would run (I training marathon time) 15 milers mask entire time. Sure mask got little wet, would replace it, glasses remained fog-free! Highly recommend, brand called Fog-Away. respectful, considerate, etc. treated poorly want kid distance pandemic feel safe home since started others care bring home.

Well indeed problem. share roof otherwise ""social bubble"" people completely different risk assessments problematic. treated poorly course goes without saying. Regardless risk tolerance, everyone treat respect. Moratorium means delay, rent isn‚Äôt forgiven anything. choices negotiate landlord, pay back rent move hope don‚Äôt get sued. least restrictive way possible wear mask say big deal wear mask suggest immunocompromised protect themselves. Covid endemic. least restrictive way wear mask instead everyone else always wearing mask offer debt holiday mortgages bundled MBS backed CDS learn since 2008. Yeah. England go onto NHS website ask lateral flow tests posted house. box 7 tests inside come next day use whenever like (Lateral flow tests ones put dropper onto pregnancy test looking thing get result 30mins) positive book PCR test get confirmation. 

If suspect covid symptoms lateral flow test positive, book PCR test via NHS website get one posted door. post back get results day later. (PCR test go lab analysis accurate lateral flow tests) 
Or book walk PCR test go local testing site, test get results texted day later. This. X 100 Archive link: one worth reading get individual stories people waited drove get now. level stupidity beyond reason confirm first hand. Misleading headline. 95% bring mask use POINT whilst out.

I example wear masks shops busy trains. hypothetical concern there's significant risk it. said neurological conditions seen common infections far they're technically possible, one myself, one proposing go outside society known. Reason poor spelling? cross tend get highest scrutiny infection. agree 100%

But read one PTOWN Vaccinated Positive Cases someone posted another thread. It‚Äôs funny make specific statement answer something different. easy say, ""I'm going live life, I'm vaccinated!"" get breakthrough infection get long haul symptoms like ""Wish took precautions""

Well would fault then. really concern. Hang thought removing mask mandates would cause death us all?

Could moving goalposts right call. Thousands die year covid, sadly life now. However UK proven categorically shit over. careful month ago, less careful year ago. I‚Äôm staying parents right now, that‚Äôs think shouldn‚Äôt go shouldn‚Äôt either curve steepness observed India found also similar UK two major case samples issue normal lot these.

This would fine except ~10 million immunocompromised people US alone good options here. also missing large group people got Covid, asymptomatic vaccinated fine, got virus remember it, vaccinated and/or fine. 

""Long Covid"" patients rare ones die- people survived well, that's something celebrate. agree high uptake makes less important know people‚Äôs vaccination status, imagine uptake much lower? Nah. get thing happening post daily thread pro-masks lockdowns.

Its way 6 months.

Normal posts sub seem opposite.

Its interesting phenomenon. avoiding word ‚Äúlock down‚Äù lock relatively brief work home era long was/is winding up. office returned work end May. NOW, aren‚Äôt cases high ‚Äúwork home‚Äù era? So‚Ä¶. Logically going back work home till case drop back low early May? (Though saying disagree comments lockdown) Sturgis!  ain't fraid Covid, got sanitize consolation, similar models UK peaked incredibly quickly comparison previous waves. hope guys experience. Yep. people deny covid even loved one dies it. see want go, European countries similar privacy laws. Unfortunately too, getting sick provides body somewhere 20-40% effective resistance it. effective one half two dose vaccine, far damage obviously.

So like hello options get sick multiple times hope die time, and/or lifelong complications related brain, lungs, heart, kidneys, gi, reproductive system etc, go get vaccine full dose mask prevent loss vaccination effectiveness.

I know black white thinker try see nuance difference examining new data come literally fully vaccinated people minute ago, vs. Eternity.

Please try understand levels right second eternity things don‚Äôt happen right second doesn‚Äôt mean result us eternity.

What *can* done? Well, know vaccine save life, *know* laying facts people change minds. That's things work, know that, would deny science assuming we've done know ineffective? know empathy, relationships, understanding ways help people change minds change behavior. things explicitly *not* mindset ""I got mine, get that's you!

No. giant winter wave October-January. giant spring wave March-May. Google covid graphs world meters covid graphs shows new global waves trends basically right line those. 

Stop trying scare people. way already happening. Yes, useful creating strategies encouraging compliance public health measures. Anti-speeding campaigns often targetted young men example , likely speed. Likewise study found men less likely comply covid measures advertising also target men. funny Antivaxers i've met women Even true, still another way cut transmission little. Also seem ignore fact people still refusing get vaxxed aren‚Äôt covid tests tracing purposes regardless fact free not. it‚Äôs absolutely mandatory something else want many deaths hospitalization vaccinated people though.

Hardly any. you? lockdown? Midwest South US even lockdown last time. northeast west coast half assed version Europe's lockdown Europe's lockdown half assed version countries Asia Pacific did. Nah fine, take proper precautions fine actually. context lockdowns, restrictions, masks: no, there‚Äôs currently scientific evidence effective.

How define ""effective"" here? saying fail contain pandemic spread practical level many people disregard them, many exceptions, enforced strongly enough, etc.?

Fine, stay inside. means fair expect everyone shut life scared anymore. Really pocketbook politicians need focused on. making unvacinated pay medical treatment emphasizes personally responsibility shifts liability exclusively. 

It's one area media smart publicly narrate; I've seen many news cases speaking what's right, really showcased several individuals economically devastated go hospital would end debate. Bills way influencing decisions... forget excess deaths. California still number 1 though. unironically Nah global wave would‚Äôve died holiday Laura. ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶and context matters  Masks commonplace Asia generally. This, combined increasing breakthrough movie infections US, suggests Delta variant extremely contagious, better resistant available vaccines. Social fatigue economic strain features pandemic outset, challenges positive set exacerbate global struggle.

Next wave incoming.  get it, scream 'it doesnt work! got vaccinated still got it,' conveniently leaving fact A. vaccinated one shot far, B. didnt wait full 10 days second shot yoloing. tests effective detecting low rates infection people. means someone within first 1-2 days infection higher probability testing negative positive.

Yes that's true, good thing low rate infections means even tests administered every child, every day classrooms, still likely child room covid-positive child 2 full school days detection.

No that's right. test everyday, chance missing someone shedding enough virus infect others effectively zero. Remember home tests results 20 we're talking months vaccines made available age group, lifetime isolation here.

You're ignoring long take administer approval. We're talking missing school year. 3 shots price 2! could make religion this. sub massively Twitter, even still ‚Äúexperts‚Äù like feigl-ding, isn‚Äôt particularly surprising I‚Äôd expect least peddle straight misinformation. Dead link Well since media spread means to. sure share information everyone know people see spreading misinformation. provide link. say everybody I?

I'll buy booster shot becomes available.

I addicted 5G connectivity. almost always case natural infection vaccination. 

Influenza - know compromised immune systems perform worse challenged new exposures.

It‚Äôs really sad see there‚Äôs almost conversation helping people improve health possibly prevent hospitalization death, improve efficacy vaccines, increase antibodies improve immune responses virus future viruses.

We could invested health promotion sadly don‚Äôt see much change area. least don‚Äôt hear heads CDC encouraging people improve health supporting evidence based practices like diet lifestyle interventions weight loss. risk death age group less 0.5%. Hospitalization far off. Fuck hesitant take vaccine fast tracked costs disease know existed 18 months ago. first authorized vaccine kind that. one 2 major manufacturers never successfully brought drug market. (Moderna) CDC recommends vaccinated wear masks area high transmission around medically compromised person. 

It‚Äôs blanket recommendation like paint makes Nearly three-quarters people infected Massachusetts COVID-19 outbreak vaccinated,

Do mean fully-vaccinated? two doses required period afterwards? 

Could link study please?  Well goes theory :( 

Sucks hear‚Ä¶  Kids catching spreading covid schools delta, delta perhaps contribute that. policies cited preventing school spread linked followed schools school year DEFINITELY contribute spread. 500 vaccinated people day dying US due covid . Educate Oh like that. So...hospitals still risk overcrowding yes? That‚Äôs argument see another lockdown. I‚Äôve seen lot talk Reddit twitter people getting (‚Äúillicit‚Äù) third doses (or second j&amp;j first). certainly don‚Äôt think makes majority increases, wonder much might contributing counts since would put ‚Äúfirst dose‚Äù column. they're American realistic choice.  yes too. 
but would make much sense. dont wanna that. America risk acquiring transmitting virus cannot eliminated.

Correct. risk acquiring virus, requiring hospital admittance, substantially reduced fully vaccinated. message spread enough. First FDA needs authorize boosters. Yes large segment population - e.g. Children 12, people allergic it, sick get - *can't* get vaccinated. want condem death too? Well they‚Äôre still liable insurance would pick otherwise like places someone isn‚Äôt insured. Yo, parents friends/colleagues sharing study fro, freaking out.

This I'm skeptical alarmist studies like one. studies distorted, like one Provincetown outbreak (it actually took place week-long gay party sorts, sexual intercourse all, therefore representative entire population. it‚Äôs masks solving root problem. know - rather, - problem. Mandating masks without mandating vaccines like grabbing mop flood burst pipe ignored. pretty immediate questions conclusions. pandemic everything new things move fast it‚Äôs definitely best wait bit different experts look data see come similar conclusion. I'd think would way around.  Sorry, genuinely mean offend you. think we'll productive conversation since tone already adversarial, let's leave there. tidbits first thing googled really prove anything. 

That's beauty referencing obscure points history people familiar with; criticize attempt get caught make valid retort.

You say contradict OP's link study saying opposite... guidance alpha variant. Delta changed things. Yeah. Asymptomatic Covid making Israel look worse be. see graph Delta landed American soil Rapid tests effective detecting low rates infection people. means someone within first 1-2 days infection higher probability testing negative positive.

This means even tests administered every child, every day classrooms, still likely child room covid-positive child 2 full school days detection.

Again, we're talking months vaccines made available age group, lifetime isolation here. Until, [because unbalanced vaccine variant comes along learned evade vaccine.

Until, [because vaccine perfect vaccines already showing decreased someone know becomes statistic.

Vaccines work, magic. reporting throughout. ‚ÄúKids don‚Äôt spread it, doesn‚Äôt spread schools! Though kids tend asymptomatic don‚Äôt test much don‚Äôt always contact trace well schools. teachers seem filing lot workers comp cases due covid infection‚Ä¶ surely means TEACHERS ones bringing schools spreading it!‚Äù know exactly asking do, right? rely naturally acquired immunity get life. That‚Äôs realistic solution.

Apparently, people building stopped paying rent last year got word eviction moratorium. afford it, fixed income, thought great opportunity spend extra on... whatever (mostly drugs, look place). I'm curious people actually going get kicked out, they'll saved $200 million Oregon set aside help people pay rent. seven day moving average increased greatly week last four weeks. I'm hearing Pfizer adding volunteers youth trial something like that, authorization ages 5-11 looms even horizon??

Ugh, point I'm going masked rest high school. Yep it‚Äôs still blasted sub daily posters saying vaccines don‚Äôt work need restriction that. 

I saw information someone posted daily thread day. fact Ministry Health Israel hasn‚Äôt screaming rooftops travesty. still haven‚Äôt able find articles either. 

The cats already bag it‚Äôs disgraceful. stop testing it. Can't find ain't looking for. talk like idiot -- extremely familiar COVID19 literature, studied written articles since March 2020. read hundreds academic articles since COVID.

Why rudely suggesting research told interested hospitalization rates? awesome vaccines still holding there, that's I, unvaccinated young people we're trying convince get vaxxed care [for record doubly vaxxed eagerly awaiting booster]. could convince take long covid seriously, opinion would go lot group quite frankly others well yoloing whole time think hospital place would ever end up...and average, they're wrong. concerned getting people get vaxxed, convince long covid meaningful risk them, stop obsessing hospitalization rates never entered minds...

You can't label fact misinformation fit narrative. reason cite fully vaxxed rate LA county assumed common knowledge thread half country average. I'll go edit thread makes fell better...but still means efficacy vaccine preventing infection dropped near 100% half that...which accuse feeding fear-mongering state it. drop large ""a little less effective"" (and neither 95% 65% whatever precise number might be). literal fudging, silencing, diminishing exactly sort concern (""a little less effective,"" ""nitpick"") exactly lose people's trust. agree point must move accept still cases, think achieved everyone wants dose, dose (I.e children 12). happens, take libertarian view situation. then, parents fully vaccinated still transmit kids - we‚Äôve recently learned full vaccinated spread virus much unvaccinated individual.  Good know, thank this. Yeah i'm thinking too, many waited around long somehow holdout month, dodging covid states often take significant measures, case Florida actively sabotaging effort slow spread. researcher describes well article.

Basically spherical shape, spike protein attach direction allowing body recognize differing spike protein shapes. 
   
He says bit like velcro, one loop sticks bit, ton loops, sneakers stay on. Numbers definitely trickling downwards feel. they‚Äôre rising. wonder constant trend coming years. Government already knows vaccinated isn't. add stupid tax refuse vaccinate pay regardless get tested not.  Israeli data showing likely well 50% effectiveness (95% CI large) symptomatic disease second doses Pfizer February, considered normal. Hopefully alright. I'm totally sick rolling dice life really want get infected see happens heh. Plus unvaccinated toddler. 80% 16's 80% 80% population, 64% total population overall.

There definitely 36% Australias population refuse COVID vaccine, especially exempts lockdowns enables international travel.  test, tell action. black white like that.

Some experts fall squarely middle, like Scott Gottlieb.

And experts like Anthony Fauci periodically jump one extreme other. Happens time, lots things (reckless driving, alcohol/drugs, etc.). Unfortunately lack intelligence tends go hand hand lack safety precautions. Darwin approves. Meh. People want return normal life, CDC guidance currently recommends vaccinated people continue wearing masks protect Delta spread. obviously case everything fine vaccinated. Maybe government concerned presenting information‚Äîthe good bad‚Äîin measured fashion came out, rather choosing whatever angle seemed likely appeal vaccine hesitant, wild swings opinion.

Yes, pandemic still ongoing. Yes, caution still required. Yes, we'll probably need boosters. end world, pretty sudden change ""everything fine"" messaging past months. dramatic change government messaging scientific knowledge. Personally, waiting game see FDA approval + subsequent vaccine mandates help drop numbers booster specifically targets Delta + variants

By then, we'd hope numbers trickle downwards instead climbing exponentially ""Fully vaccinated"" thing ""fully immune"" - measures partial immunity, makes sense talk percentage population least one shot. Reddit don‚Äôt honor antibodies natural infections it‚Äôs vaccine nothing. states hospitals overrun. comment read earlier said Oklahoma hospitals full they're sending people Texas. vaccinated unvaccinated viral load Delta? ""Such cases rare, monitoring help reveal likely vaccinated person infect others, well vaccines work time emerging Covid-19 variants""

Which rocket scientist understand. know what's going CDC, making remarkably poor choices days comes COVID. 

And public health interests aside, every single one us right data, make decisions conduct lives. I'm fully vaxxed last several weeks venturing bit, going store, etc. might well change mind rate symptomatic infections vaccinated rises. CDC works us; obligation collect disseminate data public. Better chance dying bee sting 34% efficacy preventing infection February Israel remember correctly Dr Campbells video. 19% January. Seems delta made Israel US numbers could higher efficacy US. Though hard know it‚Äôs arrival delays variant waning antibodies, probably bit both. 

The Us also isn‚Äôt really recording covid vaccinated people Gotleib said sure they‚Äôve changed decision. Schools broken mandatory testing twice week üëç noticed correct use percentages comment, upvote right away.

It's shame people unaware % sign works. Combine medical staff saying ‚ÄúFuck This‚Äù walking away, got whole lot entirely natural ramifications deliberately stupid dangerous actions. society decide reserve half ICUs non Covid patients? It‚Äôs monstrous sick people crowded reckless &amp; feckless. brother law lost phone *mosh pit* lollapalooza. remembered covid cases.  think difference immunity? basis assumption scientists don‚Äôt seem agree. ones ended hospitalization death. 

Plenty long COVID haulers miserably high fevers gasping breath breakthrough cases. ‚ÄúIntroverts true heroes-‚Äú *gunshots* testing centers around never busy Yes! area &lt;40% eligible adults fully vaccinated. 5% adults big box stores wear masks. take genius see going. promising news

hopefully rates keep like bit everyone remember Israeli study people convinced vaccines longer effective, couple weeks back? Yeah admitted got Sorry blunt, silly. ""Fully vaccinated"" thing ""fully immune"" - measures partial immunity, makes sense talk percentages population least one shot. would someone mild symptoms admitted ICU? Thank this.

I feel like many people still aiming zero Covid world‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt gonna happen.

We‚Äôve gotta accept risks lives. end day, vaccines turn horrible disease something much manageable. Vaccination way according law practice get tested multiple times per day want free Germany government pay completed test person testing, incentive advertise test centers get people come even free customer Ahh, yeah. Makes sense. finally starting feel relieved June/July... worth, USPS receive taxpayer dollars. Heres source. (vaccinated cases) 469 (mass residents)

So looks close 1/3rd 882. far data Israel. know what's going rest non mass. Cases... get 882. spouse won‚Äôt get I‚Äôm vaccinated (we‚Äôre early 40‚Äôs school age kids). don‚Äôt understand either. spouse highly educated, masters electrical engineering, companies fight tech skills. trust medical community, doesn‚Äôt believe vaccines won‚Äôt get it. I‚Äôve come accept it‚Äôs life wants take chance it. would wish is. two week period back like march people posting ""Florida removed restrictions look great they're doing""

What happened posters 5/900 0.55% cases hospitalized. I‚Äôm pretty liberal Christian open accepting lots interpretations Bible reality. guy objectively making decisions career message mission Jesus. I‚Äôm science teacher accept evolution Big Bang climate change vaccines election outcomes fact, are. I‚Äôve evaluated claims risen Christ think legit merit well. came church late much reflection reading didn‚Äôt grow it. sorry experience wasn‚Äôt good hope someday come back denomination. Best you. absolute worst Desantis. think actually evil. Never underestimate people's stupidity. made announcement inside restaurant packed shoulder shoulder anti-maskers. got infected, he'd go hiding we'd never know. Im vaccinated really selfish side. hoping beat get back right track football season starts. Please excuse ignorance, afraid heading toward limited zero capacity again. vaccine now, seems much different still seeing huge crowds. expect crowds stay? number would push that?  people can‚Äôt vaccinated though immune system can‚Äôt handle it. Ya don‚Äôt say. Good. birthday August 2nd. I‚Äôd love see country reach 70% like, tomorrow, I‚Äôd take 70% nice birthday gift‚Ä¶. Tyranny sucks true, important.

However data, everything need, *something* valuable data inspect nonetheless. fuckin Texas.. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

It worke, end of. got us Kent(Alpha) variant, time Delta appeared vast majority elderly/vulnerable fully vaccinated. hospitals nowhere near stretched been(with covid patients). daily deaths still low(although one death still one death many imo). Brexit bigger concern right now.  Red Tide Ron again. people praising him! understanding guideline ""substantial"" transmission county level map:  40% error data processing. point, take Israeli data grain salt provide actual dataset. Gottlieb say? thought said nearer end Delta surge pandemic. people actively spreading mutating deadly disease vaccine offered 96% doctors country took 3.76 billion doses worldwide. victims edgy.  That's Disneyworld 346 (vaccinated) 469 (from wager: going see watershed shift public health messaging next three six months regarding breakthrough infections.

Anyone keeping close eye (for example, data coming Israel number in-vitro studies neutralization) saw coming - breakthrough infections ""extremely rare"" occurrence. We're starting see beginnings domestic shift ""official"" position U.S.

My specific wager messaging (and supporting data) shift ""breakthrough infections extremely rare"" ""breakthrough infections expected still relatively rare"" (where we're almost now) ""breakthrough infections common, still reduced risk hospitalization"" move late fall winter. underfunded schools infrastructure come crashing down. Attracting businesses starving tax funding losing game. Nothing wrong taking time

And actually easy sounds I‚Äôm vaccinated got breakthrough case. also lot severe first time got it! wouldn‚Äôt think would see shutdowns much see vaccine requirements mandates. necessary tools protect people time around (the vaccine). kids vaccines boosters approved even better shape. Here's question. talked (Kinney's) pharmacy anonymously.

He said hinges insurance. Even though national registry, insurance information given (and insurance billed) shots. know third. pharmacy checks beforehand like prescriptions. covered (and 3rd shots be) there's shot given. EUA status, CANNOT self-pay vaccine.

So anyone actually gotten 3rd shot successfully themselves? (not hearsay) it?

I'd love easy ""walking in"" look like it. Goddammit. thread closed politics, Abbott post is? That‚Äôs misinformation. Delta variant produced similar amounts virus unvaccinated vaccinated per new CDC study. Smh.. U.s. case rates already exceeded numbers last July seem still rising fast.

On hand, hospitalization death rates seem much lower, believe. Though also lagging indicator. outdoor weddings fully vaccinated guests resulted breakthrough cases even deaths. get vaccine helps would cases without it, vaccine isn‚Äôt giving level protection seemingly pre-delta. means fucking nothing. humans unmasked store means fucking nothing like 10% humans building wear mask. Intelligence 100.  mother old daughter ü§î way around. anti-vaccine goofy.  tf release Friday nobody paying attention? Yes, old school Drs used ask 'how bowl movements '? Whereas NHS webpages dumb downed talk terms 'poo' reach masses. general practice US seems wait huge crisis upon us taking appropriate action.

God forbid try get ahead crisis. sister works park thinks vaccines plot big-pharma make immune systems weaker. It‚Äôs upsetting mother old daughter ü§î article:

‚Äú‚Ä¶what necessary reduce (spread) vaccinate many people possible fast possible across globe.‚Äù

According source, giving government authority inject people probably best way stop vaccine resistant strains.  Abbott‚Äôs one trick pony. always fucks cities especially Austin give base something cheer about. 

If cities want it, Abbott wants ratfuck it; base hates city folk. think Christianity supposed make immune troubles world going bad time. kind symptoms low numbers means numbers simply useless. extrapolating non-data. first sentence encapsulates everything I've ever known Christians meet quit parents church 18. 

Every Christian chooses interpretation fit already firmly held beliefs something. Even contradicts bible general human decency. 

And there's drastic example like Roy Moore Falwells, come claim ""He's real Christian.""

Reality, every Christian I've interacted acts behaves degree hypocrisy delusion ""knowing look"" others failing. 

And come say ""This are!""

No. is. truly different. outlier. wondering thing looked EO. says businesses can't require vaccines ""patrons customers"" say anything employees. 

I also curious Orange County requiring vaccines employees, EO basically says local governments can't issue vaccine passports. 

So guess legal... now. He's going fight Mouse great they're setting precedent. Taken r/COVID19 (with 74% attendees vaccinated 74% infections vaccinated people, vaccine would relative risk reduction 0%. 
If 84% attendees vaccinated 74% infections vaccinated people, vaccine would 45-50% protective. 
If 94% attendees vaccinated 74% infections vaccinated people, vaccine would 80% protective.  
So, really isn‚Äôt helpful without knowing ***level vaccination event***. Except survivors smell taste nearly year later. talk actual people read info Reddit? aged badly. Yes sir, think ppl tought covid vaccines would kill virus would somehow drop 0... like bruv, chicken pox existed 100s years took literal decades vacine kill it, ppl tought 1 year could eradicate advanced virus covid... Refukinglax, use mask,distance public much , still live life minor inconviniances  may enjoy article: I'm vaccinated waiting effect appear.

CDC lifted mask requirements vaccine shown effective spreading it. masks coming back Delta changed that. much turnover become every employee short amount time mean, Florida mostly open whole time done 17% worse California heavily regulated business shutdowns, mask mandates, event closures, etc well year. 

At point start wondering what's damaging approach. Yep important.. people population vaccinated people area catch people. unvaccinated people would cases period would make higher % Thank saying this. anxiety terrible. think right think India decided stop counting. brings numbers every time. sure what's Britain. someone chooses vaccinated. protect them, won‚Äôt protect themselves. lockdowns return hospitals fill up.

Hospitals filling happening places poor vaccination rates, see Florida, Missouri, India, on. UK Israel, infections rose hospitalizations deaths not, significant rate. 

Also, hope effective policy people actually need protected. I'm sure forcing mask mandates okay people need protected, vaccine mandates passports step far. 5 900 people total very, good Actually, starting go way. Note infections hospitalizations among vaccinated. fact 80% hospitalizations vax'd. Could report BS came Similar thing acquaintances know. One girl attended school went got first shot today. posted Instagram story shortly saying got close contact two people tested positive, one ended hospital told ‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting shot COVID sucks‚Äù. urged people also go get it. 

So, stories regret mouths didn‚Äôt listen SOMETHING, least. Yea know meaning notices. also looking VA data -- ""Percent cases people fully vaccinated"" 99.24% -- really hate kind fudging. using cases way back January almost nobody vaccinated anyway, cases sky high winter surge. overestimates effectiveness vaccines. (if nobody vaccinated, can't breakthrough, there?) often glossed over. report showed initial COVID antibody test showed tested positive covid-19 antibodies. tested positive ‚Äúsupplemental antibody test determine antibodies specifically exposure COVID-19 virus.‚Äù  tested negative that.

The part quotes directly stated report Eh I‚Äôm rn I‚Äôm super concerned know plenty people get revaccinated shots fine. Getting repeatedly vaccinated titrations show don‚Äôt proper immunity standard practice medical field. think worst case probably doesn‚Äôt anything, best case I‚Äôm immune compromised boosts efficacy (which I‚Äôm worried didn‚Äôt strong reaction shots). countries weren‚Äôt already starting issue 3rd doses people like I‚Äôd think more. cases spike, blame anti-maskers make us fight amongst suffer break rules laugh us really think enough Republicans going die change balance power? 

Do think poorer dem voting minority groups also vaccine resistant may also dying? 

Do realize vaccine uptake among senior citizens much higher population at-large? at-risk population mostly vaccinated, large percentage potential mortality COVID obviated. seniors much likely vote Republican.

What I‚Äôm getting is:

1.) doubt mortality statistics going politically skewed enough change balance power

2.) frustrated, angry, morbid, engaging dark humor okay. Cheering Darwinism mass death Republican voters comes awfully close sort attitude got us mess. looked like Dem areas getting hit hardest Kushner Trump said, ‚Äúeh fuck it, let ‚Äòem die.‚Äù don‚Äôt think behavior want replicate.

3.) Fuck Republican Party deepest circle hell. won‚Äôt die save us themselves. save vigilance, voter turnout, action. Movements poo UK, damn thought funny. still dragging heels approving vaccinations children? fact children access vaccine literally reason wear godawful mask anymore... anyone adult refused vaccination deal consequences actions, let get life. Daily infections lower, Imperial College random testing showing increases.

I assume that's vaccines working. People catching covid, getting symptoms therefore getting tested. Official figures show increases, random testing catching asymptomatic people. agree person learning important vaccine available December - wait another months get least first shot put back school? Huh, know could tell difference initial COVID antibody test showed tested positive covid-19 antibodies. tested positive ‚Äúsupplemental antibody test determine antibodies specifically exposure COVID-19 virus.‚Äù  tested negative that. 

The part quotes directly stated report relevant wanna put money 17month old isnt really wife's kid grandkid. know we're fucked lying us buy N95s full face respirators available?

Your tinfoil hat's tight. starting see vaccinated people rather freely get transmit virus (that is, vaccines sterilizing)

It's still much lower numbers without vaccine. whole point curb spread. Even 10% reduction worth it, that's 10% reduction mutation variance. buys us time, desperately Coronavirus vaccines lose effectiveness somewhere six months eighteen months out

All existing studies experts disagree this. know yet.

And even matter everyone medically able get vaccine, got one.

Even needed annual boosters, we'd guess going find need strategies vaccines get back kind low level cases. US least, seem anyone's radar, gone all-in vaccine idea.

Vaccines step 1, especially since US masks seen kind civil rights violation.

Obviously works tandem. vaccinated mean time lick toilet seats jump pile syringes local hospital dumpster.

Step 1 reducing vectors spread, vaccines effective that.

Don't conflate ""you still spread covid vaccine"" ""vaccinated people spread covid much unvaccinated people do.""

You still wear seatbelt even might still get killed car accident. technology efficiency rate. Goalposts always shifting suit them. Thank you. certainly will. people feel better punished unvaccinated people. 

The important goal.  vaccinated, assume get it. safest group seems ones already OG covid. argued already engaged domestic bioterrorism. Russia thrilled disinformation successfully launched bioterror war without every needing fire single shot. activate secret weapon american stupidity. include stranding citizens around world giving shit manage can't come home? Saugatuck, Michigan (another gaycation spot) called ""Suck-and-Fuck"" lol  This.

Feels like need shout ""it's covid!"" afterwards. flip side is, delaying results, probably peak flu cold season done, ensured thousands children get infected return school. Masks distancing simply reduce spread Delta variant enough prevent outbreaks in-person schools. Look recent data Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar, masking never divisive issue.

I surprised fully half children get virus next January vaccine approved early fall. Sure, major problem vast majority them, plenty get sick, plenty spread homes communities.

If feds really believe ‚Äúthe war changed,‚Äù need start actually acting like we‚Äôre war, allow families make choices usually wouldn‚Äôt allow, explicit acknowledgment imperfect information, mandate get children vaccinated, choice available parents. sure joking, but:

a. 57% UK's population fully vaccinated, less number US states. 

b. US schools closed moment, still summer vacation essentially everywhere Yellow easy see color! /s wanted politically correct ;) Covid aside, city hardly police staffing it.  true though? 

I know two breakthrough cases live separate households (who don‚Äôt personally know other). that‚Äôs folks went got tested. Plenty people complaining sudden allergies colds, never get vaccinated told months rare contract covid. wonder too!! never said would vanish. said worst behind us. 

I think US face another wave results death serious cases winter wave. reference winter wave roughly 10x daily deaths present time.

Do think surpass 4000 daily deaths future? sure hell don't. Would like provide different definition ""worst behind us""? 

This virus endemic. us forever. never going away. failed defeat it. learn live it.

Natural immunity perfect. Neither vaccines. pretty damn good. Good enough comfortable predicting worst behind us.

Predictions worst behind us purely speculative. current trajectories support thesis. Delta w/ Vaccines less deadly Wuhan/Alpha without vaccines. Anyone believes worst behind us asserting virus evolve significantly escape vaccines/natural immunity and/or evolve lethal. That's certainly possible. Anything possible. bulk comes vaccines though imagine vastly different picture. think vulnerable people actually least infected group people. tried hardest infected. young people never really damn. never lockdown Florida

Then Universal Disney closed months? live Orlando, city basically closed March August. get qr code scan official app prove vaccination. enter event, even restaurant current restrictions require it, show qr code id. What? weird article.

It said kids sent home ‚Äúin class bubbles‚Äù
(???) we‚Äôre unlikely spread parents.

But hitting pay wall also says daily testing effective quarantining. That‚Äôs pretty important distinction. Seatbelts, helmets vaccinations easy comply with. Stopping smoking alcohol addiction, even maintaining balanced diet, psychologically much harder since means trading short term rewards long term rewards. tried stricter punishments drug war stop people taking drugs.

Surely there's something right numbers including single dose? talking fully vaccinated folks. YEAH SHIT, EXPERTS First day Reddit? site absolutely loves uneducated people speaking absolutes, regardless direction people Florida achieved levels ignorance entitlement never thought possible. Keep breaking records Florida! can't 'as contagious chicken pox' 'schools spread COVID.'. One wrong. said, agree sentiments fully. unfortunately, think inkling easy answer. misinformation helping either.

on plus side, longer living florida, there's that. stay safe. believe nobody forced vaccinated. image alone forcibly injecting someone something simply intolerable, especially Germany. time public interest kept mind.

I think captured dilemma nicely. 

Forcing people let government inject something bodies seems like going lead anywhere good. think issue politicized now, imagine that. Refusing vaccine would become heroic act resistance martyrdom, rather dumb personal choice. think government manpower facilities actually compel tens millions people, even police troops could somehow compelled hold people give shot day long months.

There also practical matter determining whether someone already vaccinated. childishly easy fake vaccine certificate moment, least US, technicians found squirt vaccine floor issue certificate normally. Setting infrastructure would harder fake probably years-long project.

I hold hope achieve good vaccination rates convincing people good thing do. know that's getting first, think give up. ""Guns kill people...something something something."" Regeneron way less effective later strains. 5 covid cases LA county breakthrough infections, example.

That‚Äôs incredibly misleading without also citing vaccination rates. exaggerated example, population 99.99% vaccinated, you‚Äôd expect around 100% recorded cases among vaccinated, doesn‚Äôt say anything efficacy vaccines.

LA County 16+-year-olds around 71% vaccinated least one dose (86% among seniors). Considering 15-30% population 4x reported cases 70+% population, it‚Äôs pretty clear vaccines effective even using example. (Also, point young people vaccinated, young people rarely symptoms cases probably severely underreported.)

All data shows vaccines effective preventing infection COVID, including Delta strain, preventing severe symptoms catch it.

People spreading fear really poor understanding statistics. I‚Äôve seen many horribly misleading statistics Delta variant. You‚Äôre feeding directly anti-vaxxer narrative. people sub think going like UK start declining cases get experts making statements like these? Love it! could go quarantine hotel somewhere else awhile. 5 tests per week 2ish months, got shots, free.

It mainly looking whether people needed multiple doses vaccine even infection virus, common talking point unvaccinated (skipping altogether even). found second dose little add top first, post infection, recommend skipping now. basically said infection counted half vaccine dose two step. course schools spread it. people schools spread it. Nice try deflect blame. party ""personal responsibility,"" GOP seem love blaming democratic government citizens' failings convenient. people want vaccines threatened shoot anyone came door offering vaccinate. believe virus even real ffs. Every CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, supermarket pharmacy offering walk-up vaccines cost, time. much easier freakin' get people? 


Admit it, dummies taking gene pool, can't say feel sorry point. feel bad collateral damage selfish morons take way - sadly, shitty antivaxxers don't. ""me me"" per article, people saying, ""If knew *I'd* feel bad, I'd vaccinated!"" never, ""Oh god, many people expose virus kill stupid, self-centered, paranoid asshole?""

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Also look % population COVID date (tested positive), three sitting roughly 10% respective populations.

All things equal, suspect UK's testing rate vastly exceeds Florida Missouri though, surprised true case count states date far higher.

Overall, shock true vaccinated + infected figures would push FL MO closer UK's overall figure. Maybe quite there, getting there. least, really, really, really hope sakes. state level ya, possible like FL peaks drops like UK TX spikes nationally drop FL would US effectively much better 50%, far know, Japan large segment population thinks conspiracy. Said conspiracy group US's vaccination rate struggle improve, regardless Delta. I'm sure Japan's vaccination rate give comfort folks US, anywhere really.

 Delta variant, we're beginning globally reap effects noncompliance populations. many silver linings pull here. no! robust studies world UK, Singapore, etc‚Ä¶. show vaccines provide great protection Delta. dying advantage. Alright bubble boy. There's whole lot money stake they'll try keep going, knows.

Sounds terrible can't believe men power feel need control woman's vagina. personally effected life? hard understand sometimes I'd like reddit hear experience. empathy better. Humans acting humane. rate let's go version, sample size fine. see deaf blind it? think assuming things opinion incorrect fucking time. Let's keep vaccine mandate rolling. CDC recommends masks region indoors time regardless vaccination status others. explicitly call ""all indoor places"", exclude college campuses. would suggest look stylish KN95 masks, plain KN95 masks designer cloth mask top. going wear mask might wear one actually works course want look good.

Others campus advise got jab good go. CDC recommends. expect negative peer pressure place. That's likely influence practice anything read Reddit. 

Are going die get breakthrough? Almost certainly not. low probability. could turn positive miss two weeks feeling small effects none. might pass along someone else, someone give might die. That's neither compassionate socially responsible. probably get away it, sort person care. true light Provincetown many cases vaccinated spreading other? People sitting close quarters two hours. Personally, feel safe. Four days ago--yes. know now. guess we'll find soon. really try understand bad things happen good people.

Good people? understand mostly infectiousness far however think hoping could surpress cases without needing approve 12 things looking July percentage positive tests also increasing. Well places eat drink allow remove them. eat drink grocery big box store. 

But true hot hot outside, hand, places wear air conditioning. pointless wear outside. Today, nice cool day could almost forget wearing one. they're uncomfortable somewhere hot sweating, either repeatedly wash buy new ones. 

The could said clothing. Yet one complains wash clothes. 
It's new thing people hard time adjusting. 

I hear difficulty hearing people, definite drawback. I've lots people trouble understanding mask. find hard understand people well. grand scheme things, big deal. worry. Voting normally comes percent. Pretty sure many die Spoiler alert: is. far sounds like mild cold/flu. catastrophize long covid know, get it.  COVID vaccine passport verifier/scanner apps EU countries recognize vaccine certificates EU countries? example, Scanner app CoronaCheck Netherlands recognize/validate certificate someone got vaccinated France? Yes way. wear mask required put sometimes even required get sketchy vibe place people fucking time. Hope vaccine mandate keeps chugging along. high transmission rates it‚Äôll burn fast. Blah blah think that's necessarily accurate number though. look [actual reports](http://ww11.doh.state.fl.us/comm/_partners/covid19_report_archive/covid19-data/) math, cumulative total goes lot that:

July 9: 38,157 
July 16: 38,388 (+231) 
July 23: 38,670 (+282) 
July 30: 39,079 (+409) 

My guess there's lag reporting deaths, 108 ones occurred last week 301 happened earlier weeks. obviously means last week's number grow significantly. Among persons breakthrough infection, four (1.2%) hospitalized, deaths reported.

Among 4, 3 J&amp;J, two underlying condtions

(info comes footnotes)

Don't forget 6% HIV immune suppressants(although none 4 hospilzed HIV) think meaning argue someone else you, friend try ignore politics enjoy great things. Yup, vaccines exactly designed do. access one, please take it. Yep absolutely guess least saw side effects getting Wait year what? see people become magnetic? kids daycare. Cases still low am, upswing. I‚Äôm terrified fall.  Nope. Grow pair mandate vaccine. Plenty precedent supports it‚Äôs way actually crush pandemic. fucking around masks people don‚Äôt wear correctly anyway. Don‚Äôt give pressure rush much. Pfizer won‚Äôt finish submitting final data September. Reviewing data submitted fine way speed things approval October would lead many doubters never getting vaccinated. timely approval would probably reduce doubters 20 30% compared rushed one.  still herd immunity general rule, transmissible virus gets higher threshold herd immunity.

The initial reproduction number (R0) refers number people, average, someone virus infect unprotected population. current reproduction number (Rt) refers number observed population, gradually becomes protected natural immunity vaccines. spread slow down, Rt value needs 1, since means average infected person passing virus less 1 person. 

The R0 value previous Covid variants estimated around 2 3, Rt value less 1, somewhere 50-70% population would need protected. average person passes Covid 3 people, 70% people protected, 2 3 people would infect already protected, bringing Rt value 1.

The new CDC report estimates R0 Delta variant probably 5 9.5, threshold herd immunity somewhere 4 every 5 people (80%) 8.5 every 9.5 (\~90%) need protected. So, herd immunity still possible, threshold much higher.

This probably oversimplification since reproduction number always best way measure spread virus, invite anyone knows correct me. bottom line though, herd immunity still possible, require either lot people get vaccinated lot people get infected. I‚Äôll blunt, can‚Äôt ‚Äúdo want, mask!‚Äù can‚Äôt justify entering restaurant mask greet hostess, fine maskless front waiter wearing mask. hypocrisy makes uncomfortable point don‚Äôt want go out, want stay home. mask became permanent society (that‚Äôs hyperbole, people 100% seriously ask this), I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôd able socially adjust. People take stupid risks prove fatal profound impact family friends. enough intelligence learn mistake. don‚Äôt die become impaired. That‚Äôs evolution.

I've seeing closer 150k extra deaths official numbers though hard tell covid. Pretty sure change mind clear isn‚Äôt good sample population. Sweet, trolling allowed, calling isnt ?

Figured I'd share store.

I know questions - male young 30s. workout 5 times week eat religiously health diet. bit health nut - get vitamins tested - Vitamin perfect blah blah.

I almost feel ashamed got COVID. 1.5 years needed get infected. decided go CDC guidance follow suggestions. hindsight - bit cautious. probably got COVID eating weekend group friends.

Either way - started sneezing 4/5 days ago.. turned ""twinge"" feeling get throat feel cold coming on. Two nights ago started feeling crazy run down, bad headache, chills really bad. thought - way COVID. Took rapid test next day - sure enough it.

I really bummed - really concerned long term COVID effects. upset lax worry paying organ damage things now. 

I live Florida (of course) - careful smart. I'm feeling bit better fever high 100.9 - trending around 100 high 99's. GF thankfully (but i'm bit jealous) tested negative totally fine. also Pfizer vax exact time.  Thank much sharing sorry hear son suffering Kawasaki disease. 
May ask located current case situation factored approach interactions?  

Certainly think people watched unfolded India paying attention since 2019 understood Delta bring new challenges. 
I glad doctors paid attention helped family adapt! 
Take care. think do? started pandemic feeling like unreasonable person wanting air travel US shut down, US government pay hotel rooms indefinitely overseas Americans could repatriated. friends called alarmist thought would soon. solution would cheaper saved lives.

Now care seeming like alarmist. military line borders prevent access. date set Americans return US, international air travel closed indefinitely. take smaller economic hit Fortress America cutting trillion dollar checks PPP loans every 3 months. Ships carrying international goods American shores permitted disembark.

No school openings child vaccinations (data vaccinating children done last year). Mandatory masks nationwide facility federal government legally require. Mandatory vaccinations every single person government legally force get vaccinated. Mandatory WFH employee require physical presence office. Tax breaks companies instituting mandatory masking vaccination requirements, tax penalties companies fail pay pointless deaths sickness cause. company individual violating laws would face draconian penalties, including prison sentences ruinous fines. Hundreds billions annual funding incentivize development treatments covid, unlimited fast track work visas granted medical scientist willing come America develop assist research/vaccine production. 

Only extreme measures hope getting us back normal life. don't, live pandemic restrictions years decades. People tire this, civility go window, conflict vaccinated unvaccinated tear country apart socially politically. Assuming virus mutate something infectious comfortably carry 10% death rate. would catastrophic. Exactly am, discussions popping keeping restrictions like masks social distancing forever scare much actual virus  Nope. Doesn‚Äôt mean all. 50% country adding vaccine induced herd immunity I‚Äôm sure think abstaining part solution power move. 

The increased unfettered spread unvaccinated primary reason much circulating virus, circulating virus people (unvaxxed, vaxxed) get sick. vaccinated people may spread someone else, less likely so, less likely infected, numbers grow less circulating virus.

Or, could take root reason thinking gambling infection novel virus know little documented exponentially higher risks complications vaccines smarter option. Real big smart guy energy there.  sucks I‚Äôve read data need wear masks go back social distancing. Nope.

Yes, delta viral load vaccinated essentially identical delta viral load unvaccinated--this per Fauci Walenski. noted mental health kids real issue pandemic, even kids school every day. hear then. yet cant tell strain Covid positive test? weird. Game man?? It‚Äôs experimental now. experiments done. That‚Äôs misinformation anti- vax grifters victims propaganda. papers published subjects biologic product history. EUA form approval full bureaucratic process occurs, involves reviewing case records every subject trials. trials done data submitted BLA. makes heck lot sense. use vaccination rate 75% vaccine efficacy would ridiculously small. Looking northeast, liberal affluent subpopulation, could absolutely get 90%+ vaccination rates, numbers efficacy would consistent rest world.

Question is, CDC know they're basing new mask guidance case study gaycation spot? Seems like skews data drastically compared uniform cross section population. ICU bed, ehh, what's doc? HOSPITALIZATION RATE? That's important pertinent data FFS What's nib? Propaganda fit small core belief lack understanding take seed proper gate lie Except that's 100% false. 100%. that's problem. People running around believing less likely catch vaccine. they're wrong.

And that's transmitted.

And mild case Covid still brutal. virus system getting organs. Comparing early stages pandemic everyone vulnerable breakthrough cases infitesmal amount vaccinated people simply make sense Rand Paul former certified opthalmologist claimed approaching herd immunity last September. saying one last reasons getting vaccine also moot now? matter lot breakthrough #'s taken percentage total number people vaccinated time?

Cause 330 million Americans vaccinated heard 220k breakthrough cases, would stop getting vaccine? I'm sorry, I'm quite understanding calculus here. seems like getting still amounts pretty much cornucopia miracle vaccines record time mad they're 100% effective stopping transmission. never thought they'd stop transmission much definitely think they'd effective stopping severe infections. 

Someone correct I'm wrong, vaccines still WAY effective average seasonal flu vaccine? rate, take lot death among vaccinated equal number flu deaths seem shrug off?  [DeSantis sign executive order mask wants solidify lead, make sure _nobody_, mean **nobody**, say beating Florida COVID infections hospitalizations. fuckin loser. wife said plan wait year came get see side effects first people year burn hell, along rest morons. honestly feel vaccine helped you? day's delay things would much different you. sure vaccine love coming from. would AZ? It‚Äôs exactly J&amp;J lol. Depending adjustment R0 related high test positivity rate, might good news appears R0 declining. continues next week, Florida may swing like UK (and Missouri Arkansas). Every pandemic human history ended overwhelmingly majority happened advent modern vaccine. long hit variant high immune escape potential immunity lasts long enough reach point vaccinted infected disease receede. Remember ton anti-vaxxers engaging COVID-courting behariors like eschewing masks going parties surges lot already, asymptomatically not, gives similar immunity vaccinations. closer version herd immunity stop spread know.  can't eat drink mask, they're uncomfortable somewhere hot sweating, either repeatedly wash buy new ones. 

For hard understand people saying I'm hard hearing usually read people's lips. I'm always ask people repeat say, sucks. swear never going fucking end rate‚Ä¶

Feels like isn‚Äôt anyway. people though. Thats moot point youre attempting make. know that. poster (who comment removed) claimed pediatric death rate going skyrocket. There‚Äôs evidence happening posted entire article, one top comments. story hit local news site, comments Facebook were‚Ä¶.not great September delta exponential growth full rage mode, barring lockdown, I'm sure change mind [This accurate. confusing presymptomatic asymptomatic:



In cluster COVID-19 cases, little transmission occurred asymptomatic case-patients. Presymptomatic transmission frequent symptomatic transmission. serial interval short; short intervals occurred.

The fact detect laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 transmission asymptomatic case-patients line multiple studies (9‚Äì11). However, Oran et al. speculated asymptomatic cases contribute rapid progression pandemic (12). studies may prone misclassify presymptomatic cases asymptomatic, leading heterogeneous reporting SAR asymptomatic cases, different case definitions differential duration follow-up. study used sensitive case definition symptomatic cases require specific symptoms (e.g. fever) present. Also, timing study would enabled detection late onset symptoms, gives us confidence classification exposure groups. That's viral load measured nose/ throat swab.

Unfortunately, broncho-alveolar lavage test done routinely check load lungs. 
I'd bet left nut ""load"" would lot higher unvaccinated versus vaccinated lungs. 74% detected cases vaccinated, 3 4 hospitalized patients vaccinated. seems concerning? deaths need careful about. Sprint review 12s data, homies ffs. absolute hell would CDC anyone use data then! ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è absolute disaster vaccine rollout! Got second test said positive. doctor said one false negative. 12-yr-old kid got second shot pfizer trial end June. researchers said canceling kids scheduled first shots time though, Pfizer stop enrollment weeks add myocarditis risk factor update paperwork, consents, etc. get approval IRB continuing. Information limited, pause continued enrollment giving first shots 5-11 yr olds least weeks, I'm sure automatically push October? hope that's case. I'm sure specific requirements move forward present data get EUA younger kids. That‚Äôs painfully stupid comment. Many/most vaccines require booster certain age. anti-virus software. Yep. would help level panic, think. 

I'm interested community spread numbers too. parts Florida, positive test rates.have jumped 4% 31%. immunocompromised person, use numbers gauge okay go world hide basement. know one, she‚Äôs pastor. Mega-awful. Jeez‚Ä¶ feel like we‚Äôve already. Could animals think way act it‚Äôs Delta Florida agree point despite lot fear, getting vaccinated still provides great protection even delta variant context severe illness. 4% whatever percentage covid patients end hospitalized extremely low. I‚Äôm saying let‚Äôs worry take precautions, saying vaccinations still effective far best method lessen severity pandemic. Arkansas many deer chronic wasting disease. It‚Äôs like disease-a-palooza days. Disney Florida wants, Florida Disney says. posters failed understand riskiest behavior Florida happening among tourists would go get infected Florida count towards case count home state. probably animals. COVID infections mink, cats, etc.  idea, lol. great time certainly learning experience. kids live rocks, lot take once, hehe. There's nothing important Family....or contagious. feel like post Bloomberg employee get new subscriptions. 
If not, thanks posting link directly paywall, jackass.  really bad earlier week (~150 Tuesday so), badish right. Intranasal vaccination Delta related variants primary supplementary level protection future fight virus, prevents virus gaining foothold neuters primary route transmission. serve ensure COVID burn like wildfire population again.

This stamp COVID, however. virus stay, likely brush lives much like chickenpox due interconnectedness global society via supply chains, lack uniform vaccine uptake, virus‚Äô unique transmission dynamics‚Äîit highly transmissible long prior symptomatic presentation case. Intranasal boosters, however, prevent widespread outbreaks/reduce symptomatic severity point another cold like coronavirus brethren.

Reinfection symptomatic rare. I‚Äôm seeing numbers showing previously Covid symptomatic people getting again. Reddit seems agree idea bribes lottery, guy gets it.

If guaranteed stimulus of, say $2,500 something, bet number people got shots would increased dramatically.

I'll honest, shots (not going explain situation, ask - downvote want) even would stop give money real thought. (I still get shots, would wonder reason stopping could worked around...) sick COVID-19? UK? US, think that's still premature. n=1,000,000 data UK says opposite. much less likely catch it, somewhat less likely severe outcome do, course ""can"" spread others infected know exactly much. always heard using mouthwash extra important cold flu season kills bugaboos hanging mouth...makes sense would also apply covid-19.

Earlier infection. 
That mean 1000x contagious. 

No one done studies see that's increase infectious virus. 
More investigation needed. 

The one thing delta may true, shorter incubation period.

Our Current testing regime may slow find infected people isolate infect others.

Looks like work home policy (allowing 1 day week trial basis) might get generous keeps up. 4 vaccinated hospitalizations, ZERO deaths (vaccinated not). wear masks now? understand DeSantis. He's encouraging people get vaccine: different stance masks ? only

If only... school districts even thinking allowing in-person classes? 

If kids already getting sick even going back school, imagine first two weeks school bring. Kids eventually go remote, end sick. nihilist excited.

Interesting point. feel same. witnessing one rare times history taught centuries come unfold us real time. can't change it, may well fascinated it. You‚Äôve apparently never heard voter suppression. You‚Äôre fucking tool lmao.

I'm surprised Operation Warp Speed 2.0 develop pan coronavirus vaccine highest priority. never going rate. Even Pfizer Moderna push tweaked version vaccine, matter time new variant escapes it. brainer ...

And true ... sustainable model society pandemic dominates. yeah time, can't ignore things.

Would loved play one around unable talk friends it. We've never eliminated diseases animal reservoirs. chance achieving peace earth eliminating COVID. vaccines include create virus ""spike"" ""S"" protein body produces antibodies part virus. 

Natural immunity infection also produces antibodies parts virus, notably including ""nucleocapsid"" ""N"" protein.

If test (or pair tests) sees N antibodies, assume natural infection; see S, assume vaccination. Yeah say. Meanwhile plenty countries around world, vulnerable patiently waiting vaccine. 

3rd dose fine helps, hope people trying see global problem prioritizing accordingly. Automatically thinks scare tactic article. Clicks link. Need sign read. Confirmed. I've seen, evidence antibodies waning, immunity not. 

Which actually completely normal vaccines. 

It's shortsighted selfish. CDC stopped counting breakthroughs unless resulted hospitalization death back May I'm trying needlessly pessimistic, think important match pitch tone reality here, unfortunately, reality tells us likely worst pandemic behind us. Historically, second sometimes even third year pandemics far deadlier first. I'm relying data influenza pandemics, given nature viruses we're seeing Delta variant, seems shoe might fit.  


It makes ashamed angry. best vaccines world. They're free accessible. people around world far less fortunate situations would ANYTHING take them, people self-important morons, we're collectively starring barrel gun. Again. Exactly. Nailed it.

This obviously going inflate number, fuck data whole thing. 
 
The CDC probably ""approve"" 3rd booster shot stem tide, least people honest they're track it. Otherwise going see inflated numbers like OP might wrongly implying something else.

I really wish Israel would listen this.  Everytime state company mandates vaccines like this, get one step closer fucking bullshit over. course vaccine available like 4 months ago hey, I'll take can.  replying every comment thread post (multiple posts well) trying dissuade people vaccines... means cant stop it, live it.

Wow ‚Ä¶. numbers going much better look poop find headline  *collar Relax, posted thing another thread really. know dude extrovert self centred come. one jolt Covid-19 parents covid compliant me. even lined get 1st day 1st shot available area. don‚Äôt see rude, time, guarantee could find quotes, ads, words news conferences every day CDC saying vaccines work. CDC dealing wildfire keeps changing, made missteps, remarkably consistent need get everyone vaccinated. delta even accelerated tbaf messaging. Yes, I‚Äôm paying attention. saying, probably small draw conclusions, possibility worth considering, ""obviously nonsense"". 

There situations primed immune system actually worsen outcomes. E.g. cytokinin storms. One main treatments hospitals covid actually steroids actually suppress immune system, often immune response/inflammation damage actual virus.

We absolutely need bigger studies, someone vaccinated I'm bit concerned possibility here. Maybe US 50% fully vaccinated, could also enjoying trend. could schools broke around time freedom day happened. Children unvaccinated, schools would obviously transmission risk.

Additionally, suspicion lot people caught virus going friends' houses watch football Euro 2020. That's longer factor now. UK also put 8 weeks between. think point lot (a LOT) people impression great reducing transmission reducing severity symptoms infected, confusion seems coming from. love idea. many people emergencies sent home immediately surgery due lack beds FL, end back ER readmitted different hospital. think vaccinated get priority care, sure. don‚Äôt know why, many times immune system see spike protein vaccine recognize it? ‚ÄúMore shots better‚Äù doesn‚Äôt take account B cells remember pathogen. vaccine body already recognizes doesn‚Äôt make lot sense  innocent people work living do. can‚Äôt easily WFH, change jobs, relocate. affected. could vaccinated people vs. unvaccinated area?

The point government making things, government breaking boundaries consent bodily autonomy broken before. countries used different vaccination strategies. UK 8 week period doses, countries pushed long 3 months. theory get many people least first dose protection. US stuck 3-4 weeks period vaccine trials. lof people countries first dose fully vaccinated, additionally significantly less research available long spacing doses could likely simply less effective way. wouldn‚Äôt trust pet hamster Abbott include ESPN, Marvel, etc? realize company owner set tone employees consciously not. started wearing mask guarantee couple weeks would one. Likely employee two wants mask afraid looking odd front boss (you).

Also delta wearing mask simply good business decision - less likely employees two plus weeks sick quarantining also less likely employee pass Covid another employee young kids immunocompromised family members.

Basically whether like set standard whether realize lots people wondering even bothered getting vaccinated group people justifying point getting vaccinated.

Hey Shooter, holes way üëâüèΩ Nah people saying past year half everything still shit. It‚Äôs getting fucking better. FYI, end study, findings report subject least four limitations. First, data report insufficient draw conclusions effectiveness COVID-19 vaccines SARS-CoV-2, including Delta variant, outbreak. population-level vaccination coverage increases, vaccinated persons likely represent larger proportion COVID-19 cases. Second, asymptomatic breakthrough infections might underrepresented detection bias. Third, demographics cases likely reflect attendees public gatherings, events marketed adult male participants; study underway identify population characteristics among cases, additional demographic characteristics underlying health conditions including immunocompromising Population density? probably going people concentrated cities VA may throughout state? crazy super powers

We start rumors get super powers... :-) need spread around Facebook armchair statisticians read. noticed too. Like wtf?

7, first real number , 8-12 day say thats admissions overall covid cases (or overall kids hospital). Also says 8 12 range even though there's 7

With covid? say

What?

*""Dunbar said children's hospitals summer, especially south, also busy RSV, Respiratory Syncytial Virus.""*

And what's driving hospitalizations?


As former journalist ... good editor hack piece shit writing paragraph  shame writer front rest staff.

Its bad news UK least. Republican governors going block mask mandates schools, provide free N95s every student/teacher wants one. correct PPE expensive. inexpensive cloth surgical mask provide sufficient protection significant portion people wearing one.

DING DING DING! winner! 

Everything place I've lost confidence it. I'm done taking coronovirus seriously, reluctantly got J&amp;J shot there's chance hell I'm willingly taking vaccine confidence restored, essentially impossible point. unvaccinated problem? Really? long flip flop stance too? know they're using unvaccinated scapegoat failure ""miracle drugs?"" people telling people allowed forcibly give vaccines? insane? 

I'm fucking done. probably let unvaccinated students register classes (or stay dorms) like schools every mandated vaccine. So, least one deer less 6 feet human 15 minutes get COVID spread it. correct statement? many school districts choosing make masks optional. 

I don‚Äôt blame parents mask-optional districts wanting remote learning option.  They're going infect kids blame Biden. That's best guess come with. kids going infect parents grandparents lead deaths blamed Lack education. least educated areas country rural inner city communities ones getting vaccinated. Educated black folks getting vaccinated move elsewhere. 

Honestly COVID isn‚Äôt going anywhere consider location higher vaccination rates better policy. Best luck I‚Äôm sorry deal bullshit.

Good point, reminder may useful expect delta trajectory states mirror countries universal health care generous sick leave policies. Yeah, get it, wanted turn something positive. not? Fortunately Delta still doesn‚Äôt kill young healthy people. /s Yep, courtesy Fox News. Delta variant infects vaccinated people breakthrough infections. it‚Äôs infections chicken pox. 1000-1200x much COVID upper respiratory original.

Desantis monster. true villain. red meat throwing base made people. We're still waiting solid data, know people get fewer total symptoms (regardless get them) less good spreading virus compared people symptoms.

Vaccines reduce symptoms, probably reduce spread compared unvaccinated.

If know exposed infected person, choose one vaccinated. Maybe close evidently yet. Delta certainly seems raised bar. extent vaccinated states far avoided huge surge less vaccinated states think shows vaccination far effective past infection. difference 50% fully vaccinated 60% fully vaccinated looks pretty large. Good. Never liked food Bingo! great gay men option express party like safe welcoming environment yea recipe viral spread even vaccine. Making certainly would spread viral load. died covid Exactly. Thinking lot people never pleasure experiencing bad case influenza. saw someone post knowing person post friend lost unvaccinated friend 41 day. thing bad weather, bad clothing. Nordics leading users outdoor education. legitimately laughed. needed thank you! think sticks coming big companies coming mandates day. It‚Äôs matter time funny. Serves right. lancet article predates Delta. I'm willing believe trend carries forward, really know proportion. question ProvinceTown outbreak everyone talking about, 800 people infected, 74% vaccinated‚Ä¶ 5 total hospitalized (4 vaccinated, 1 unvaccinated) zero deaths.

My question based statistics have, 800 infections unvaccinated different would hospitalization death numbers be? Damn straight. That‚Äôs good question. It‚Äôs honestly complex confuses too. I‚Äôve taken basic microbiology course. Theoretically, previous infections help herd immunity. honestly think going like influenza going get vax every year. could go tomorrow would cool. doubt that‚Äôs going happen. I‚Äôm bad guy guess risk life hang people stupid get vaccinated. Every time there's wave, cases go down. peaks goes down. 

Since multiple waves places, probably something like changes behavior response waves main driver drops peaks. Don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs down-voting 100% right UK 1.6% CFR vaccinated over-50s, 5.6% CFR unvaccinated over-50s, vaguely implying something like 3.5x level protection. That's page 19 say vaguely, controlling age (aside factors there.

This top 9x level protection (according 88% efficacy 12-week gap) infection numbers show. Combined that'd 30x lower risk.

Unfortunately &lt;50 data entirely confounded they've vaccinated people age 30-50 almost nobody 18. Under-50 CFRs extremely low groups, 0.03% range. hope tell everyone country ‚Äúif want job receive health insurance, need vaccinated‚Äù. average person can‚Äôt figure four clear bullet points, doomed regardless. Satan again! ""Did get completely asymptomatic case?"" 

""uh, no? guess know would know. I'm vaccinated though."" 

""Didn't get tested every day?"" 

""uh, no? would that?"" 

""So know many asymptomatic infections vaccinated people, dolt!"" Hey explain contact would happen Gay men one events? assume kissing/sharing drinks common. straight dude want make many assumptions. 

Like straight dude find dancing like 3 women ( sad panda ) gay dude would find dancing 3 men? 

I feel like, said, likely close contact situation.  Missouri wants shot title winter surge UK cases peaked around January 10, deaths peaked January 24. 

The current surge seems peaked July 21. follows pattern, won‚Äôt see peak deaths August 4th. 

I read article said hospitalizations still increasing UK. We‚Äôll wait see plays out. Bravo!  need every University same‚Ä¶  pandemic proven people literally ignore reality front eyes doesn‚Äôt suit want. People want life go back normal people say covid-19 fake hoax.

No one seems abide precautionary principle, did, would ended pandemic months ago. so.... we've heard last 15 months? happened Israel study last month. lot vaccinated infected vs unvaccinated turns area super high vaccination rate wasn‚Äôt enough unvaccinated infected yet show vaccine working. retracted alarm bells vaccine. initial outbreaks happen international travelers going wealthier thus likely vaccinated. feasible everywhere though. live cold, snowy winters. Seriously this. votes... Probably interests boot. Ditto CDC tied mask guidance hospitalizations deaths would lot comfortable. long focus cases, never ends. Introverted self-centered men would also less likely comply ever left house. Note study says ""vaccination coverage among eligible Massachusetts residents 69%"" life insurance industry vested interest stopping pandemic, deep pockets. vaccinations now. 

and anyway, natural herd immunity work virus spreads lot, people change behaviors. Waves peak go down. Preface saying work healthcare company. work remote employee many counterparts not. (CA)

-	Forced back work full-time end last month. 
-	Allowed work remotely 1-2 days week
-	Masks still 100% required indoors whether you‚Äôre masked unmasked.
-	Social distancing still required maintained
-	Zero exposures (at least, aware of)

Still lots unhappy co-workers company trying force everyone back office. 

We seeing people start check it‚Äôs almost like they‚Äôve realized remote work provides better quality life‚Ä¶even done forcibly so. Two critical members teams gave notice last week another week. found remote gigs. Totally underrated comment; thanks much LOL moment gave me! Yes, vaccinated, well grandpa, also near end life COPD. Imagine males trying get antlers. Yes, one bathroom That's enough wasting money proving water wet.  mom vaccinated, immunosuppressive medicine rendered ineffective mosquitoes? Oh fucks sake clearly isn‚Äôt Tuskegee experiments. People need get grip. delta Safety trials submitted sometime fall. Approval 2 older expected end year, November. I've also heard couple sources might wait approve 2 older time 6 months older trials occuring time, 6 months older end iirc 2 weeks 6 older data. never finalized application; FDA can't grant something formally asked for.

FDA wanted lots detail EUA expecting file regular approval end year, they're also weighing whether vaccine business strategic course lay blame vaccinated wearing masks instead unvaccinated getting vaccinated.

Also, bad variants far come countries. 5% world population matter much US selective pressure. want schools open open schools. Many European countries schools open last winter saw little increase spread almost increase hospitalization it. Ouch.  adults vaccinated, better protected children be. 

Which one reasons frustrating CDC failing message vaccines fucking *work* seems business obligation retain follow company wide directives. jobs require background checks, physicals, lie detector tests etc. price admission. study says ""vaccination coverage among eligible Massachusetts residents 69%."" would compassion someone deliberately refuses get vaccine? protecting idiocy? frank I‚Äôm sure virus completely vaccine resistant (that would also mean can‚Äôt recover it, since vaccination basically imitation infection)... I‚Äôm expert biology. 

If return march 2020 permanently, would something we‚Äôd need live get used to, unfortunately. Humans survive. 100% employees fully vaxxed, I'm letting people whatever feel comfortable with. rules simply dick anyone wearing/ wearing mask. far, one chosen wear one that's fine me. Look uk variants concern reports I'm study says ""vaccination coverage among eligible Massachusetts residents 69%."" gotta look long Covid defined whatever source reading. average person means ""I able work rest life."" medical literature means ""I lingering cough slight fatigue six weeks."" wyte men rare. tiny sub-percentage population irrelevant. can't put lives hold 0.0001% people. Sounds good me. remain fairly unworried.  like Nah right work control measures place prevent overreach. don‚Äôt understand people want ‚Äúget get it‚Äù‚Ä¶. already ‚Äúlong haulers‚Äù, earth would someone want chance see happens them? T.i.l!! I'm going this. Thanks Hopefully true. India rising cases. delta doesn‚Äôt seem one done. like Big Bang. Crash. growth (maybe second Big Bang know). Well shit one immediate family gotten vaccinated. live CT generally liberal, couple work healthcare. It‚Äôs infuriating. guess parents would rather miss major life events get life-saving vaccine. feel you. feel fiiiiiiiiiiine... coworker refuses vax went. apparently husband's niece, whose kids we're watching weekend, vaccinated. go? wedding Florida. mother, died last month, COVID listed one causes death.  cancer great COVID stole months/a year her.  

I'm tired trying get people.  wife already did. Go local pharmacy first, Kroger might check state database whereas local pharmacies play little fast loose. 

3rd shot reactions us mild compared second. Oh, would take opportunity laugh laugh... curious, hear places requiring proof vaccination? wondering info might floating around somewhere exact reason. Wow sub soft baby shit. Guess who‚Äôs going Disney Parks? unvaccinated, unmasked COVID deniers, that‚Äôs who! CDC yesterday said delta variant one contagious pathogens existence spreading among vaccinated well unvaccinated . seems logical assume mutate render vaccines ineffective. I‚Äôm really growing frustrated though. I‚Äôm fully vaxxed don‚Äôt want expose older father Delta may mask again. Argggg Canada pretty unique position terms vaccinated population lack covid general. Kind depends badly Alberta messes things us. leaving States, that's going well. Politicians making decisions instead public health officials. think they, people, would able say, ‚Äúyeah, isn‚Äôt good,‚Äù pushing find ways correct whatever broken.

Hopefully doesn‚Äôt happen, things fine.  Well points made sure You‚Äôre supposed think it. You‚Äôre supposed panic comply truly hope hold beds breakthrough infections people vaccinated may need gets bad. post great resource, thanks keeping current. needs TLDR section top list 5-10 bullet points important things know.
- vaccine percent effectiveness: 1) infection; 2) hospitalization 
- Top reasons get vaccinated.
- reasons worry side effects
- etc.

Then give link anti-vaxxers quickly dis-spell bad information claims floating around. wife got third Pfizer jabs. 

Reaction actually better 2nd shots. please link information side effects? pro vaccination, trouble understanding thought process behind lot people also pro vaccination. mattered

How say straight face apprehensions alone reached 1 million June year, that‚Äôs people actually intercepted released. real number naturally much higher. know data taken border unvaccinated, many infected. 

It seems strange people vocal lockdowns, masks, vaccinations completely silent someone mentions hundreds thousands infectious cases streaming Texas, distributed throughout country. God forbid someone mention might partially Texas showing lot cases. 

Nobody even mentioning jabbing come door. would think guys would least insist foreign nationals vaccinated. matter American citizens vaccinate?

The messaging importance vaccines masks seems depend agenda. get it, nobody really wants discuss border political leaning, can‚Äôt ignore fact Covid aspect needs addressed. spending time expressing dealing Covid *most important* thing world.

People right hear tell wear masks even vaccinated. completely ignore hundreds thousands unvaccinated people pouring country, really takes lot urgency message. people getting booster shots? got initial shots April/May Hell, even vaccinated Palestinians yet Travis county voted around 80-20 dem November one? 50 percent society fat hillbillies trailer parks Alabama. 
Ironically I‚Äôm sure even define skilled labor anymore Blue collar trades much harder find nowadays College educated b2b salespeople. 
But I‚Äôm blue state get (CT) 60 folks varying levels underneath. least skilled/HS educated contact center agents certainly 100% vaccinated. percentage moves move up.  Walmart way, shape, form ‚Äúgood guy.‚Äù Hi australians, enjoying 393737th lockdown? Lmao Oh! joke, again!  sure you‚Äôre downvoted. Truth hurts guess Well, many countries real lockdowns. Meaning ticketed police (or worse) even left house. Even get mail wrong time. Yeah, August 9th doesn‚Äôt even apply Americans. vaccine card won‚Äôt even help right unless Canadian. It‚Äôs likely either Canadian citizens permanent residents. saying exactly, CDC lying 75% efficacy rate vaccines dont work period? unvaxxed start getting vaxxed September protected. 

And time vaxxed unvaxxed people give covid. think people want get vaccine deserve able buy health insurance? That's fucked. mixed messaging really benefited antivaxx movement (who either willfully naively misinterpreting say). Every time see news article info CDC they're force spreading misinformation discrediting CDC. Considering large number people even read beyond headlines read comments instead surprising are. years building mistrust MSM also helped things. Since Delta mutation variation supposed transmissable, wonder variant transmissible surface contact prior variants. Seems surface cleaning hand sanitizer use diminished. Anyone free wear n95 mask they‚Äôre afraid getting sick, no? Wish could send unvaccinated back. awesome here, low case numbers, everything open, life back 100% normal. unvaxxed people come vacation. must young something. covid largest group anti-vaxxxers granola eating hippies. Basically Austin‚Äôs bread butter. White chicks dreadlocks refusing get young child‚Äôs vaccines. Yes. called Covid related shennanigans parks breeding hazards virus.
Fuck everyone supports garbage company. Yes, evidence suggests original formula works well delta, people may need ‚Äútopping off‚Äù (boost), particularly it‚Äôs since first vaccinated. companies could make delta targeted vaccine fairly quickly easily, nothing easier churning one already are. long original continues good activity variants, wouldn‚Äôt expect see variant specific boosters. needlessly would likely gum works cause confusion. Oh shit making Ireland that‚Äôs sick. live didn‚Äôt know Yeah either furiously producing already building stock crock. 
I imagine able make (Delta tuned vaccine) already want get base original vaccine uptake higher first, dissuade people saying ‚Äúsee, vaccine doesn‚Äôt work!‚Äù 
Not saying agree all, best guess happening. Donning fucking mask throwing 10,000 fucking cases 115* warehouse goddamn heat dome right now. Doesn‚Äôt matter I‚Äôm vaccinated nowhere near people.

Fuck shit. That‚Äôs asking warehouse laborer get heatstroke. Except real research. based online poll...

Thanks, didn‚Äôt make effort get paywall. Lol.  started vaccinations December, would love know infected gotten 6 months ago relatively recent vaccinations. 

The consideration P-town, known party town. wonder level contact (bars, etc) could contribute getting higher levels exposure. 

It‚Äôs going interesting case study. say new? ‚Äúsky falling‚Äù, repeat family work lost 9 year old Delta. sky collapsed them. lady blew wife knows lost Dad‚Ä¶and husband 3 weeks later. 

People don‚Äôt need live fear lackadaisical attitude precisely got us start with. month Pfizer did. Probably behaviors rather genetic reason. bunch vaccinated men see need take precautions cooped year. Ok understand. great resource. hope mods keep pinned.

After CDC disclosed latest Delta variant yesterday, seems confusion. Anti-vaxxers claiming CDC admitted vaccinated people get infected easily non-vaccinated. that's excuse getting vax. links squash line BS? ^(maybe meant got exemption via vaccination proof exemption valid supposed didn't.) responding lurkers.

Vitamins, spices, etc. prevent Covid severity. evidence assertions. 

If want real immune booster get vax. vax helps rally bodies immune soldiers quickly exposed prevent infection and/or severe cases Covid. Giving body recipe Covid vax shows fighter cells look patrol gives virus less time multiply unnoticed.

Save yourself. Follow science Facebook shares. They're possible. situation evolving. Ideal would plan early detection containment escaped China annual Chinese New Year exodus. system dismantled months outbreak.

Next best would permanent team plan, staged resources, established channels throughout whole government quicky assimilate disseminate information resources. team plan, discarded year outbreak.

Those things put back certainly last novel virus emerge world. hindsight little help now.

Now must muddle best can, aware we're global event historic proportions course going disruptions inconveniences. last count 4 million officially among dead, many died without benefit counted indeterminate. Let's glad we're them. vaccinated spread same! understood recent CDC report correctly, they're infected happen. vaccinated still less likely contract (and therefore spread) virus also protected. something say makes insecure basement dweller feel better themselves. Yep. I'm worried immune system toddler born spring 2020 isolated whole life. pediatrician says immune system still challenged putting everything mouth, dread onslaught illness finally starts playing kids. again, plenty kids stayed home early life ""catch up"" eventually went school, COVID isolation much extreme. get tested basically activities germany.  We‚Äôre already mass spread. Can‚Äôt mass are. Germany going full American, see. Haha! Good them. exactly that! U.S. needs come something make people get vaccinated. basically makes like inconvenient unvaccinated. Right requirement entry normal indoor life like gyms, restaurants, bars, etc show proof complete vaccination, recovery covid last six months, recent test. Making unvaccinated pay tests pressure go anywhere. way less restricted life vaccination.  I‚Äôm saying don‚Äôt know long term effects yet common neurological damage infections yet, occur. don‚Äôt want encourage unchecked spread understand better risk factors.

We also already coming plans respond better delta (a delta focused booster example).

We cusp 4th wave last wave basic restrictions it. think COVID-19 deadly, ironically, wouldn‚Äôt divided actually got lower death count overall. division precisely young healthy-ish, is, average, terrible.

Note disagree think let rip young sheltering old infirm, society interconnected shut one group, time, could see coming from. 30% people 3X.

Still, Texas average deaths per capita New York second point standa. argument made learning live includes gathering festival atmospheres time being. I‚Äôm judging kids right now, thinking loud. party ‚ÄúI take responsibility whatsoever‚Äù back! Like trend blood oxygen going what?    live mind asking. Airborne waste probably think context missing. talking tests required non-essential social activities like restaurants, bars, cinemas etc. Yeah none live county steady 1 0 cases per day. Vaccine rates super high it‚Äôs rural. There's two groups anti mask vax people here.

The first group feels vaccines promised end restrictions. people even equate masks quarantines.

The second group feels wear masks vaccinated discouraging people getting vaccinated. often people feel government messaging tailored facts, rather tailored policy get best action people. ‚ÄúAs far know fine corona.‚Äù 

That‚Äôs blatant falsehood. documented side effects, statistically significant unlike you‚Äôre talking about. Get nonsense. agree, seen suggestions - medical bills covered insurance, etc., they‚Äôre consciously choosing get vaccinated. feel pocketbook thing may actually get people. ?? It‚Äôs both. 

The best brightest tend go US, world brain drain. Freedom, $ accept essentially races cultures.  


Example: 1/2 Silicon Valley $1b+ companies started immigrants.

Top US tech companies market cap, CEOs, ethnically diverse.

Top Chinese tech companies, Chinese men. see greater context. long we're protected symptoms severe reactions seems good enough me.

At point virus going endemic either get vaccine get virus. Outside hospital capacity concerns whether fully spread 2 months 6 years seems arbitrary. 

It's like ripping bandaid off. feel like people arguing masks, lockdowns, etc outside context hospital capacity equivalent telling me, ""but hurts, pulling hairs, etc."" Yeah, that's pulling bandaid does. fast get wait weeks fall off, either way temporary measure. shocking, believe evolution modern day Republicans work hard drive extinction.  Anecdote: also dont know anyone got Covid post vaccination 80-90% friends family vaccinated (this % include children age 12) Exponential growth happens fast‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Oh, I'm relying entirely calculations here, sake argument I'm willing take granted they're precise correct.

My question challenge data itself, question clarify trying imply given data, concluded DeSantis must making ""right"" decisions, based solely fact kill *fewer* people decisions made governors. fair interpretation trying say? think even difficult stuff changes quickly. couple months ago general consensus constituted ‚Äúgood plan‚Äù tie restrictions vaccination numbers. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll lift restrictions 75% pop vaccinated‚Äù. turns they‚Äôd never reach point ‚Äúoops, actually vaccinated spread new one much unvaccinated‚Äù are. don‚Äôt think matters saying ‚Äúwe need 0 COVID cases‚Äù, also know can‚Äôt wait hospitals completely fill something People likely post experiences related COVID sub dedicated COVID. Plus unusual and/or vivd experiences likely posted ""nothing happened."" 330 million people America alone. get biased view. saw one 80‚Ç¨ here, germany. yeah, one cheaper. doctors got paid 15‚Ç¨ per antigen test initially, 8‚Ç¨ IIRC. Mayors requiring masks defiance state-level ban mask mandates, assume. Bad idea... testing go lot way telling covid actually spreading. Stupid fuckers, serves right Hm. think I'll keep one work.

I similar conversation lady getting first dose went get second. said kids thought crazy getting they'd seen videos TikTok. laughed said ""They want put magnets get home."" told absolutely let try. Hopefully kids vaxxed school. Yes sticking heads sand *exactly* right move.

Your attitude exactly things even gotten point has. Covid? Shut up. UK variant? Shut up. Delta? Shut up. 

People downplaying pandemic variants get-go gotten world? saying ‚ÄúShut up‚Äù *anything wanting ignore information wanting live state denial. 

Its people like said ‚ÄúShut up‚Äù anout Delta time people realized something concerned about, everyone caught off-guard. Expressing concern Lambda next variants puts healthy amount emphasis important getting everyone vaccinated actually suppose shutting getting done masking much also. Florida , Texas many southern states going get slammed. gets crazy hot everyone flocks inside heat. Nice cool , circulating air conditioning. eventually chainswords jam collected gore heretics. power sword, hand‚Ä¶ never gone party gotten cold flu before? People really forgotten life like 2020.  kind fake panic porn this? Seriously, height pandemic didn‚Äôt get bad. still get vaccinations Spanish flu. pandemic started 1919. deal mutations every year. answer present issues is, probably. law state FL ask anyone proof vaccination, mayor's allowing companies require proof nationally continue practices even though huge fine per occurrence state. Mayor's waiving fines. Cities requiring workers get vaccinated, ""law"" FL. then, experts saying study shows ‚Äúvaccines work‚Äù.

I really like write think real reason doubt vaccines work well practice. possibility broadcasted vaxxing decrease risk infecting others motivation many central idea ""herd immunity."" policy people ran ahead knowledge. I‚Äôll explain one time you. smoking doesn‚Äôt spread family. isn‚Äôt cigarette gets lit mouth smoke somewhere.

When get covid likely infect family. really read it, trying show concern unfounded, quite literally impossible. Like would upend literally scientific knowledge true level impossible.

And yeah, bot pretty strict. I've ban posts I've made safety data. would way better way putting info you. don‚Äôt want get tested, don‚Äôt. don‚Äôt make risk profile assumptions rest us.

And yes, makes difference. It‚Äôs non-zero chance vaccinated pass unvaccinated kids immunocompromised parents vaccine efficacy lower. 

That matters world. R&amp;D went product paramount.

Manufacturing moving Asian countries labour costs increase tensions rise Asia due Xi.  going work Disney? don‚Äôt remember claims right thing given space. like governors trying one absolutely regressive regard public health. 

Which one going outright ban masks schools? Y'all laugh, would really surprise?    granted, totally respect sentiment coming from. one issue certain people immune compromised, like mother instance, contraindicated vaccine. stayed isolated waiting heard immunity...

but everyone else around different idea. spent three days icu. one take bipap thursday.  last two minutes. sooo.... that.

on plus site, another room available considered deserving.... medical ethics easy. need considerate issues. Cool story bro. hospital full?  Even 6 ft guidance first announced, many people would get it. give shit clueless, continue hamper desire normal. (Although majority 2 groups mentioned, always normal)  lot trash thinks slick.

You even understand medicine science, think fool govt? Exactly, that's problem. medical expertise. trials report every single medical issue people report taking vaccine. that, go back compare placebo vs actual vaccine see presence symptoms actually higher people vaccine. person died may died something totally unrelated. need wait see results study.  gonna keep posting overblown story different site every hour? Hospital strain creeping quickly. There's plenty stories Florida Missouri regarding delaying surgeries. well-vaccinated metropolitan county running ICU spaces. vaccinated worry hospitalization CV19, I'm concerned needing ICU beds ""normal"" extreme medical emergencies like heart attacks car accidents. full range motion sore least 24hrs. felt bruised like someone punched arm. Given 70%+ infections detected vaccinated, vaccination rate group WAY 80% efficacy numbers make sense. feel like many people used saying ‚Äúof course % infected vaccinated goes people vaccinated‚Äù haven‚Äôt looked numbers case.

And sure, perhaps vaccinated people likely get tested, that‚Äôs speculation without studies. I‚Äôm open arguments sample size small, actual data saying vaccinated people likely get tested respond contact tracing, etc. know we‚Äôre making sorts assumptions make feel better without data? ongoing observational data large population significantly credible anecdotes point-in-time data specific subpopulations make covid tax give credit vaccine proof real doctor can't get it.

Virology citation needed.

&amp;#x200B;

If mention Toyota going say Lada? Apple vs sone Russian junk? Yup, people get supply chains work. Many vaccines US pretty much either ""locked"" either used going waste. Last year, virtually states mask mandate private business big box stores required masks customers. year, look case. places bring mask mandates back need set real goals end ""grass greener"" effect going hit hard year. unvaccinated states get mask free go concerts, responsible ones going masked even dressing rooms open. see keep months time

The reason happen last year like 11 states mask mandate, even Texas Mississippi one! Plus big box stores required customers wear masks etc. Already Walmart said customer mask mandate Kroger recommending even employees. understand mask mandates hospitals overwhelmed like seeing cities approve them, need sort exit strategy point. live NY several (very stubborn) friends refuse get vaccinated. believe they‚Äôll fine get COVID vaccine BS. It‚Äôs beyond frustrating. inability control transmission virus here.

Inability? Texas government seemed level best prevent people taking precautions. Saying unable UNWILLING helluva stretch. wish would focus getting stranded aussies home. yes, always possibility new variant could deadly transmissible delta headline real headline.

How real headline? 40 60 infection concerning though fact know vaccinated people spread Covid easily. conclusion is; take risky vaccine else might get even worse? 

A health profesional tell outweigh risks per individual case. case healthy 40- yo always better risk experimental meds. far know fine corona. Sure rare cases cases rare already proven side effects. 


I dont good point cant refute it. Interesting logic Texas 3x population New York, they're passing New York? Sounds like Texas done good job honestly... people vaccine, cases breakthrough infections. Think way: 100 percent people vaccinate, every infection would breakthrough infection, would still many, many less overall infections no-one vaccinated. Anybody else feel like wave going burn rather quickly? Fun fact: first shot sputnik V basically J&amp;J shot, people see sputnik disgust respect J&amp;J... that's sad 400 70 million child covid deaths. That‚Äôs lower flu.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* really think holding longer anything? Vaccinate learn live this, thats point. Per capita deaths nursing home deaths governors ordered Covid positive patients back into.

What‚Äôs measure? every COVID death attributable governors kind baseline number? Like, could tell shot hours, wasn‚Äôt sore inflamed anything. Total range motion using like normal. 

I swam day second dose lol That‚Äôs newborn probably wouldn‚Äôt get sick it. that‚Äôs certainty. That‚Äôs whole point article. rather take risk, mask careful. folly rely solely vaccine eliminate virus. multiple tools disposal. 

I hope starts become accepted wisdom. magical thinking around vaccines last year turned badly misplaced probably never realistic first place.

I hasten say I'm people getting vaccinated, everyone should, vaccines first step need think beyond develop additional strategies. wish would stop studies healthcare workers. ultimate convenience sample. However, really representative sample general population. ain't much, honest work. IDK, seemed month ago. Case rates low areas. Remember natural infection contribute immunity.

Though agree *lasting* herd immunity, cases drop zero come back, happen due nature virus. needed study this? Basically, vaccinated, still guard. I've relaxed bit personally, still never go shop place w/o mask on. last days i've noticed people masking again. whole delta wave everyone peak ""c'moooooooooooooon man"" territory. 
Also, side note: finally got siblings get first shots last week. I'm like ""What hell waiting for? spend $$$$$$$$$ hospital visit lifelong damage? go get free pair shots piece mind."" 
Essentially extra lazy, knock sense them. Ha! Love  No. ICU care disease trauma even without Covid. hasn‚Äôt gone away. Adding 117 Covid patients usual load creates crisis. realize fears come emotional level, science/stats won‚Äôt necessarily help, I‚Äôll give try. UK completed significant study effects COVID children 12. found that, last year, approx. 10M healthy children 12 UK, two died COVID. children died time period lightning strikes, vending machine accidents, choking, drowning, I‚Äôll stop REALLY long list. Looking kids, including kids serious medical conditions (not like asthma, like inpatient care type stuff), death rate spikes 2 per million (vs. 2 per 10 million healthy kids). So, literally one-in-a-million shot one kids die COVID.  Hopefully Hvac filters upgraded everywhere especially nursing homes, folks pay lot money abuse receive places. don‚Äôt hear enough filtration time covid. 
You shouldn‚Äôt downvoted simple fact. answer. I'm tired living here. really am. could would move. getting worse people care. use standards Qu√©bec, anyone scan qr code. jwks encoded it. decoded mine easily online tools. reddit thread /r/programming it. I'm glad posted this. sort writing article aggravating reasons list. article read recently reported stat infection rates something like 50% area, went state original infection level small begin with. Somewhat akin going 1 2 reporting 100% increase. 

Regarding hospital numbers, 9 month old daughter RSV couple months back ended ER Sunday (Dr offices closed here) urgent care clinic feel comfortable treating her. daughter anywhere near sick enough need ER visit, agreed UC clinic would best checked rather wait Monday. assume similar scenarios play time COVID illnesses skew numbers somewhat.

I'm trying downplay increase cases, think reporting needs pretty clear what's happening use concrete language. Thankfully, even though live Central TN (where Governor recently fired head medical doctor audacity reach 16-35 encourage vaccinations recommend mandate masks Broadway...the local school district fairly progressive developed full online curriculum upcoming year.

So elected that, mostly due local area complete shit-storm anti-vax, gov't conspiracies ( tons radio/podcast hosts here) general complacency plus tourists.

I'm thankful option. Yeah, at-home-tests allowed legal restrictions, usually require test testing site vaccination - would cost yet known, think tests &lt;5‚Ç¨. Abit ironic immediatly chose lock hundreds badly ventilated small room.

Ah, freedom, stupid get. First I'm American, I'm talking situation U.S. specifically.

I'm also saying virus causing death severe illness places world atm. course, (and strongly linked who's vaccinated not).

But long people take vaccine, infection rates matter. agree? lot people seem afraid virus spreading general, we're protected death severe illness (which vaccines highly effective at) infection rates matter? TiL people identify women people? vaccine must shown beneficial kids. would contrary mission, immoral, approve vaccine dangerous kids virus is, dangerous kids certain situations. believe case, job determine this. 4 1 way small numbers draw conclusions from. reasons study good indicator vaccine efficacy - see discussion comments below.

The thing CDC concluded study vaccinated people *with symptoms* potentially spread Covid. Apparently shocking them. economic disaster caused lockdowns, were. economic disaster caused raging viral epidemic made people (rightfully) fearful going things.

Having roaring pandemic ignoring nothing consistent booming economy. introverted work hospital really. People need better understanding effectiveness actually means, vaccines attenuate severe disease. don‚Äôt magically block infection, especially ‚Äúgay bear week‚Äù larger gay men (if ‚Äúbear‚Äù accurate) lot fun close quarters thousands (MA county case study). US even central DB vaccinated people issue digital certificates validated? expensive rims Go prison instead fine every time they'll stop it. short answer yes we've known along. 

While rare, early cases talking people apartment complex connection one another, many floors apart catching it. thing common ventilation.

Researchers knew look potential link thing happened SARS.

Both SARS original lineage Covid far less transmissible Delta. vaccine showed seriously strong efficacy making preventing contracting original version. phenomenal efficacy preventing severe disease. still phenomenal effective preventing disease delta, need obfuscate worse preventing contracting  I'm sure part confusing you. everyone wear masks day. fact think point made even obvious part chose quote specifically mentioned wearing go store.

We OK. Delta even taken main variant province. Provincetown? Would absolutely packed July 4 weekend. It‚Äôs tiny little town, tens thousands people would probably weekend Let's say true. vaccines masks make like 90%+ less impactful? Pretty sure American's making decisions. agree. don‚Äôt know realistically open schools CDC saying virus contagious chickenpox dangerous younger people. topic studied, methods. Got it. researches bring us back middle ages

I see lot. actually mean. think studying human psychology trying understand human behavior send us back feudalism? next month hard, sure. need restrictions, people get vaccinated white thing ends.

I really see problem can't solved, think hard wear mask till numbers subside.

Feel bad nice folks staffed hospitals, sky falling. infectious it'll fine months again, barring mutations. But, reasonable take precautions much stomach people advocate pretending nothing happening.

Meh adopted Asian woman Caucasian parents, dad mistaken husband wife since teenager. Usually, simple ""laugh off"" situation. Occasionally, there's awkward moment. 

To fair, thought, dad accompanied (bio) mother doctor's appointment. time, probably 90 years old, means 55. Office staff mistook spouse. guess sometimes, people just....wrong? family collectively knows multiple cases covid six covid deaths. One 30 something yrs. old. Everything really bigger Texas, even assholes We're process getting 2nd shots soon even makes nervous even knowing we're vaccinated. son breathing issues (surgery done currently possible) gets it...the thought sends chills spine.

I totally get saying feel safer home, long possible. know read?  Cases rising India. It‚Äôs gonna burn quickly. dude like poster boy whole country

Hmm maybe non hesitant vaccinated America, half couldnt different. fairness made lies  suggest read post get bit context. Sure. Except that's exactly still-recovering alcoholic going high list liver transplant. ruin new one too. no, care provided equally. provided patients best chance success - case that's people vaccinated. rather chocked death virus though Yeah. county grew 7.8% vaccinated. is. research tensile strength certain composite materials automation. Researches like brought society now. Woke researches bring us back middle ages. Stop pretending shit science. Centers Disease Control Prevention recommending fully vaccinated Americans wear masks indoors they‚Äôre area substantial high coronavirus transmission.

The CDC, institutions, seems repeatedly missing point here. goal wearing masks prevention strategies keep ""area"" *becoming* area high coronavirus transmission. keep head planted sand *already* area high coronavirus transmission, failed.

They basically saying, ""if horse already run away, sure lock barn door.""

Making people wear mask nation's highest priority right now. key data points infections hospitalization ond deaths amoung vaccinated.

there outliers mostly elderly comprise vaccinated population given zip code, seems one obese elderly/underlying medical conditions still need try stay fuck home unfortunately:( parents moved Florida, CT, kid. turned great move. still visit family Florida, way would live there, worse raise kids there. much people sub seem weird fetish this, that's going happen anywhere world, regardless vaccination rates. primary hosts adult ticks terrifying varying collection diseases.

So really, large reduction deer population would upsides. commenting preferences value judgments. correcting potential misstatement relating breakthrough deaths. read yesterday areas already black levels Florida. press briefing last night one big healthcare providers there.

You‚Äôre seeing kids get sick? haven‚Äôt seen much news it‚Ä¶ Mississippi‚Ä¶ Messaging entire pandemic hot mess. here's problem: first thing say thing people listen to. Changing minds later extremely difficult. fucking outset, communication bungled.

There needs intermediary body specialized information management &amp; dissemination works global Disease Control authorities address incomprehensible disjointed communication average people been. there's anything needs unified that, can't trusted make decisions unilaterally. Taiwan desperately sending swaths data beginning, urging institute mask mandates, ignored. coalition virologists epidemiologists understood &amp; communicated early 'six feet apart' meant nothing (based tuberculosis guidelines LOL) performance theatre surface sanitizing distraction focusing limiting indoor time others, increasing filtration air circulation. 

The given much data virus dragged feet making sort effective proclamations caused much confusion reticence. masking second heard respiratory. made recommendations roommate refused unless store mandated it. kept telling ""virologists epidemiologists recommending wear masks especially indoors"" response straight ""well said need won't"". People listen them. need someone give weight professional insight medical bodies &amp; experts since proven can't trusted to. *11 counties case new mutation branch.

Delta beta people, less density huge starting advantage. managed squander every advantage had. far evidence suggests delta variant significantly lower CFR strains Hope survives, treasure look face comes back work comes face face previously mocked. think mean ""spurn"" means reject disdain contempt. Lifted truck bros guys fish motorcycle profile pic me.  Unfortunately city Austin also support surrounding areas comes providing hospital beds. Thank you! We're ones know street gleefully awaiting everything magically 'normal' get kids sent school rush office. Just...no.

Personally know 3 co-workers (out 12) refuse get vaccinated. *why* forced go brand new shiny shoulder-level cubes next people? Makes mad...I dreading it. They're also type make fun wearing mask so, it'll fun I'm sure.

I feel sad trapped. truth. per capita rate still lower, it‚Äôs arguably worse considering timeline outbreaks occurred. populace leaders better informed time Texas got hit, republican leaders media figures (and even liberal media lesser extent) wanted spin masks/lockdowns/vaccines yet another culture war signifier instead common sense solutions. 

At end lower classes society still main victims virus population never give shit unless it‚Äôs right face Since posting anecdotes here, know single person ever Covid. know around dozen service industry folk breakthrough cases, none ever even considered needed hospital visit, thats still huge difference. Small gov't! Unless hurt someone! \*A\* problem unvaccinated. bigger problem Delta. grip Epsilon Lambda yet. Remember Massachusetts outbreak was/is mostly among vaccinated people. wearing mask sucks especially you‚Äôre working. never said going wear mask -- essentially, give shits people care others.

As far understand it, people [who really can't take COVID-19 kids 12, people allergies. [ingredients mRNA briefly read crossed common allergic reactions severities, see anything commonly causes reactions. I'm wrong, please let know. 

Yes, breakthrough cases, severe sickness, deaths [are right. 

The compelling thing said likelihood new mutation, even vaccinated unvaccinated person. consider that, believe far likely new variant probably likely appear unvaccinated dipshits me.

I wish mitigate hospital capacity problem, folks show ER unvaccinated gasping air sent home taken care there. way gets ahead someone everything right heart attack. Hell -- get first priority mess stupidity unvaccinated. 

I'm staying home anymore.  mentioned deaths. That‚Äôs really good thing. well, read somewhere 3 vaxxed hospitalized J J. can‚Äôt verify one, someone said yesterday fourth one Immunocompromised. PEW online polling... exactly terrible thing. people never published research think quite literally know better. I'm really sure think qualify scientific research considering scientist researcher, think matters much. get political yet? guys going admit directly connected politics? occur - risk it? Seems like simple choice some. people Cape call it. low risks take every day exist. drive, go airplanes, eat processed foods, eat beef known carcinogen.

We also know side effects Covid, many statistically significant. One death. Another respiratory complications. week we‚Äôre beginning see link Covid dementia, leading Alzheimer‚Äôs.

The nation war footing. get back go daily lives, vaccines likely required. know said waiting information, hear many people highly doubt ever find good enough. Yet go lives eating fast food, chugging soda, avoiding exercise.  Big dumb assholes likely big dumb things. 11. Odd flex. Australia rocks I‚Äôll wish well.  Travis county 60% fully vaccinated context here. trouble viewing people getting exactly asked deserve ""unethical"" way, shape, form. letting Karma job. I'm worried vanishingly small outlier data, I'm worried killing 73-year-old dad. 

Get vaccine. depressing. feel safe going anymore knowledge severe illness hospitalization reduced mean damn thing end permanent lung organ damage. 0 deaths

without vaccine would around 20-30 people dead dying headline makes sound really bad, truth number consistent throughout past years even covid. 70% population Travis Williamson County vaccinated, doubt see hospital flowing data saw last year long people feel they've done part time move on. worked company 18 months 15ish those, wear mask, wild me. barely ever saw coworkers actual faces able read actual emotions vast majority time working there. Right left, hit 100% stopped masking, per cdc guidelines. really nice. mean Texas always going illegals, people seeking asylum crossing border well people currently Texas. It‚Äôs much smaller percentage problem compared normal population Texas.

Vaccinations work ppl, don‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre fully protected getting infected. Esp you‚Äôre contact unvaccinated, contagious double shot. i‚Äôve seeing breakthroughs vaccinated people US. isn‚Äôt clamoring Pfizer Moderna come Delta booster. aren‚Äôt feds pushing it? barely seen anything delta booster (i‚Äôm sure 3rd regular dose booster thing) don‚Äôt know anyone said covid all. Pfizer/Moderna even allowed sell 3rd doses Isreal many others world still waiting 1st dose. Spread who? unvaxxed? /r/nottheonion side effects? second Pfizer kicked tail even though first easy. I‚Äôm frustrated lack guidance boosters I‚Äôm really considering taking hands looking Moderna shot, definitely 6 month mark mid Sept, better preparations/plan guidance place I‚Äôd willing hold till mid December. wondering prepare terms side effects third shot. talk herd immunity via vaccines. reason won‚Äôt happen unvaccinated tend live zip codes population unvaccinated. hang unvaccinated people. Work unvaccinated people. live state around 60 percent totally vaccinated. zip codes 20 percent vaccinated.  high vaccinated population Source ""horrible"" side effects? sore arm 12 hours maybe (but unlikely) needing take Tylenol PM bed one time count. think there‚Äôs disappointment frustration, even though, most, minor anticipated setback. felt really good state reporting weekly case numbers instead daily low, going even slightly direction feels like letdown.

But think overall picture hasn‚Äôt changed part basically knew last hurrah virus coming point. Hopefully people‚Äôs predictions last big wave it‚Äôll fizzle quickly accurate, tend think so. I‚Äôm expert. quit wearing mask started socializing again. Goddamn Delta enablers hell.

Even super liberal north east governors education departments refusing mandate masks schools. even elementary level. want kid stay home another year, all, can't depend adults running show responsible I'm going choice.

Wearing fucking mask big deal. I'm sick crybaby assholes brought us point. many point fingers antivaxers demonize them. antimaskers bad. People aren‚Äôt going flock Reddit post people know haven‚Äôt Covid, definitely tell people know catch it. study appears conducted Delta became dominant variant. you‚Äôre mentally unwell  Wake guys Yeah really zip code zip code situation. state zip codes 80 percent vaccinated others less 30 percent. rage. *Equivalent 600K positive test results per day.

UK office national statistics regular infection surveys consistently suggested 3x many people covid get tested positive. Presumably mostly asymptomatic low symptoms cases people realize infected.

600K positive tests day would therefore like 1.8 million actually cases day. pre ious infection continues give immunity, would burn way country month. doubt we'll see level infection. 

Also, entire UK got infected current vaccine efficacy serious disease, expect another 50K deaths, compared 130K far. Begun, delta wars Oh it‚Äôs definitely solution. I‚Äôm frustrated too. I‚Äôm glad one charge hospital even hinted this.  random family members I've told about, dont know single person directly speak regularly gotten *covid* let alone breakthrough case.

That doesnt mean real dangerous I'm saying never pay attention peoples anecdotes comes this. Someone Facebook comment (I know know) claimed knew 3 people family died **from** vaccine. Always skeptical peoples bullshit anecdotes. think corps finally starting realize vaccination may actually good bottom line. ah yeah! totally true, didn‚Äôt think that. think would great way handling it. people don‚Äôt deserve access. Well national level definitely true, something like 97% hospitalizations unvaccinated. could true one area chance, vaccination numbers. elderly area vaccinated hardly young could see that, since elderly much likely end hospital first place.

It could also lie. highly vaccinated group gathers course infected vaccinated.

Delta must work There's evidence people getting breakthrough cases. take look one top posts sub, delta variant appears give much fuck vaccine. 

There absolutely chance even well intentioned already vaccinated individuals keep coming get another booster every 6 months feel like shit several days time. People done it. see comments around reddit people saying much, evil anti-vaxxers like real good obedient folks got jab ASAP, starting see there's something amiss. Duh. Fair enough. suppose say ""an uncontrolled online poll research making wide sweeping conclusions writing articles about"". You‚Äôre thinking critically, you?

I super excited get vaccine got soon possible, frustrating constantly hear even vaccine turning completely useless (or will, next variant).

Also, allergies really bad-double duty masks win! Masking isn‚Äôt big deal me. I‚Äôve worked health care, parents immunocompromised pandemic. We‚Äôve worn masks while.

But bigger point I‚Äôm hearing tendency bash vaccine vaccines do. provide level protection infection; provide greater level protection severe illness; provide still greater protection death.

The fact vaccine holds well highly contagious variant swept country months vaccination efforts began testament vaccine, criticism.

And people thought going magic bullet didn‚Äôt count number folks resistant getting vaccine whatever reason. point, regardless CDC‚Äôs messaging (which hasn‚Äôt stellar) people need say loudly number unvaccinated biggest problem.

My county also 17% positivity rate past week.
Other parts state higher, hospital network already cancelled ""non emergency"" surgeries. major staff shortages beds filling day. Children hospitalized higher rate ""height pandemic"". nowhere near peak pandemic people get vaccinated. 


I hope loved ones safe many people's not. family 2 non optional surgeries week sick stomache might get serius COVID case recovery fucking moron thinks know better.


The pandemic over. people get vaccinated height pandemic. Viruses love mutate.


Just affected yet mean happening happen loved ones. 


Vaccines, masks sanitizer vitally important still. Germany one test per week free atm test site (you use acitities like getting hair cut etc). difficult right now, low infection rates need test. propably soon, numbers rise. 
Of course symptoms doctor recommends also free.
And need test work employer provide fast tests, get reimbursed government.

As far understand government's plans want make people pay tests go cinema / barber etc. can't say much might cost. Maybe 15 euros per test test site?  one Reddit responsible pushing vaccine mandates, try contacting Congressman instead. article deceptive. breakthrough cases rare vaccinated people, rate going rise dramatically overall cases rise dramatically. people yet exposed delta variant. people exposed, infection rates increasing, increase among vaccinated too. agree vaccinated people much better protected delta variant unvaccinated. Hi World. best vaccine world great efficacy variants. great, please share data? No, don't, trust me. started wondering today people who‚Äôve hospitalized huge medical debt.  definitely continue socialize--just follow CDC guidance masks.

Everything much, much safer last year. Western propaganda hell drug side effects have? Pfizer? Thanks! I'm nearly 60 hotspot. I'm seriously considering this. pay close attention experts Israel recommend. hit 6 month mark September hope know then. Iowa, officials encouraged people get vaccinated, state's Republican-majority legislature governor blocked local governments imposing vaccination mask requirements, limits attend fair event begins 11-day run Aug. current leadership turned back science turned back what‚Äôs available us fight pandemic leaving Iowans struggling could prevented,‚Äù said Dr. Megan Srinivas, Iowa-based infectious disease physician nationally recognized research, includes said people misconception outdoors ensures safety, virus actually spread large dense crowds state fairs large concert see large congregation people especially mixed vaccination status, we‚Äôre going see high risk transmission increases transmission,‚Äù addition, delta variant two three times transmissible prior virus strains, creating additional risk among fairgoers stand line food, share condiment dispensers hop carnival rides, Srinivas said.

‚Ä¶ US, EU UK policies clearly reflect accepting virus endemic. countries elimination still attempted great we'll see long lasts (Australia South East Asia).

Good point transparent metrics implementing policies though. Doesn‚Äôt Florida also lead nation average IQ residents? Oh goodness written exactly two sentences can't decide stupidest change. Texas Mississippi. 

Vaccination rates cities fairly high overall state 51% receiving one dose vaccine (One dose still protects hospitalization/death). elderly/immunocompromised particularly well covered. 

The recipe sustain mass death there. 1.	People aren‚Äôt going vaccinated unless it‚Äôs mandated, probably won‚Äôt be, that‚Äôs whole problem. 
2.	That‚Äôs said first round vaccines around corner, again, won‚Äôt force people vaccinated, going keep happening. Yes wear mask frankly that‚Äôs bandaid. going keep happening. ‚ÄúRare‚Äù terms not, originally said true.

Yeah that‚Äôs I‚Äôm lookin right now. I‚Äôm fully vaccinated, healthy, etc.

Just last time hard get ticket due reduced capacity may actually airport thing immigration thing. perhaps bridge deal, bridge toll. PCR tests significantly expensive rapid antigen tests talking here. 469 people studied outbreak. 74% vaccinated 347.6.

4 people 347.6 1.15% 

So little 1 hospitalization per 100 cases vaccinated people.

11 hospitalizations per 1,000 vaccinated getting infected 

110 hospitalizations per 10,000 vaccinated getting Covid-19.

Now imagine potential places lower vaccination rates.

Granted, read article, information age ranges, pre-existing conditions, etc..

But think people fail realize impact 100 people hospitalized Covid-19 local Healthcare systems places.

Can't leave coworkers hanging, though, they'd never forgive me. Good. Fuck antivaxxers. even better strategy would increase vaccinations COVID becomes endemic, idea still scares people. It‚Äôs misleading. It‚Äôs clear data seem dismiss living fear become addictive. 1. delta wave way first wave.

2. much younger population makes comparison useless.

3. deaths massively undercounted, making comparison even difficult. Millions died. Best way I've handled step outside restroom get with, drink water, try avoid talking eating get home. Sometimes throat gets really dry allergies whatever.  Alright then. Remember: number comes China fabricated. wedding? Like area? high community spread? Worldometer, almost 100k Nationwide separated cases day Florida, dont think would case. Yeah. course virus care eligible. üòâ 

Nationally, u.s. slightly 50% fully vaccinated. 50 million people 12 under, that's huge group. published pay publish journal lol PLOS One okay, fact published says far journal says research. 92 million people quarter population, almost third eligible. Including kids 12, 42% entire population shot.

If similar percentage kids 12 get vaccinated, that'd 32 million still 16 million kids getting it. 

We need 2/3 population vaccinated herd immunity. I've never encountered shop restaurant actually checked QR-code test (German here). People photoshop date onto old test result.

I think pointless, make COVID vaccinations mandatory done it. Amazing delta! article though, clear strain sounds like isn't.
Is data % delta? Delta variant came India, yet people seem concerned getting third booster raising overall vaccination rates. evidence less period February June 2021 one initial wild-type SARS-CoV-2 strains supplanted Ontario, Canada, first variants concern (VOC) N501Y mutation (Alpha/B1.1.17, Beta/B.1.351 Gamma/P.1 variants), Delta/B.1.617 variant. increased transmissibility VOCs documented data increased virulence limited. used Ontario COVID-19 case data evaluate virulence VOCs compared non-VOC SARS-CoV-2 infections, measured risk hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, death. Methods: created retrospective cohort people Ontarios testing positive SARS-CoV-2 screened VOCs, dates test report February 7 June 22, 2021 (n=211,197). constructed mixed effects logistic regression models hospitalization, ICU admission, death outcome variables. Models adjusted age, sex, time, comorbidities, pregnancy status. Health units included random intercepts. Results: Compared non-VOC SARS-CoV-2 strains, adjusted elevation risk associated N501Y-positive variants 59% (49-69%) hospitalization; 105% (82-134%) ICU admission; 61% (40-87%) death. **Increases Delta variant pronounced: 120% (93-153%) hospitalization; 287% (198-399%) ICU admission; 137% (50-230%) death.

I know anyone could read wrote come away idea think infection better vaccination. not. way worse.

But point, going happen, (for part) people getting infected *chose* so, rather getting vaccinated.

It is.

FWIW, support employer vaccine mandates vaccine passports, way actually make this. Masks temporary measure going get us herd immunity. True. think they‚Äôre still town long enough positive case recorded New Orleans hospitalized there? 

I guess maybe many tourists coming could infected pass non-vaccinated local population, well rare circumstances pass vaccinated locals develop breakthrough cases question. limited number acute care beds, Trump didn‚Äôt give warning impending crisis. takes time spin build facilities place people in. supposed do? Keep nursing home patients tying beds hospitals limited capacity? it‚Äôs needed patients? There‚Äôs limited staff, supplies. shortage test, ppe, ventilators beginning.

Again, don‚Äôt really know anything, thinking it‚Ä¶ classic case deliberately looking something, celebrating finding it.

Hopefully CDC reverse orders collect data breakthrough infections. confirmed PHAC Canadians. I'm watching Missouris cases closely. first get whacked Delta, average vaccination rate. 

They appear rounding corner, St. Louis mask mandate might impactful thing here. I'm disappointed apparently data CDC one outbreak happened track. much there. can't say anything 1 unvaccinated hospitalization make comparison unvaccinated vs vaccinated rates this. may vaccinated skewed older/more high risk. good data Israel across cases, one outbreak hospitalizations, still shows average 88% effectiveness severe COVID (severe = need hospital). actually dramatic reduction 99+% original variants. way 50% residents got infected. LA county 10% population confirmed cases. I‚Äôm pretty sure wouldn‚Äôt 33% total infected. Also, herd immunity would require way 50% even 50%, LA tourist area people US traveling bring infection someone leaving LA returning bring infection. Wait 2 weeks. It‚Äôs going much much more. R0 original strain 2-3 we‚Äôre looking 7-9. Precautionary principle. followed whole pandemic may even covid spreading right now. 2 months show 1 10 people get infected lifelong neurological damage - important information consider response.

Many countries taxes used cover additional costs healthcare related use tobacco alcohol though, countries eating habits too. Similarly countries high fuel taxes go towards healthcare costs etc. Also India literally 3 months ago makes headline number bit meaningless imagine. Yet track hospitalization death also mentioned article quite low. Wow, Florida‚Äôs population 21.5 million?

We literally fully vaccinated people studies neurological effects ongoing. need information come flying blind right now. literally talking months here. Theres around 40 left US apparently.  douchebag billionaire killed Sears destroyed Kmart too. Well that's alarming. Natural infection faster vaccinations cost human life percentage Americans think infected last months? Guess what? immunity faded large daily cases again.

While fading immunity might play role--and still debated--a much larger effect delta variant contagious.

For R0=4 (alpha), herd immunity threshold 1-(1/4)= 75%.

For R0=8 (delta), herd immunity threshold 1-(1/8)=87.5%.

LA nowhere near threshold (nowhere US really is), course cases going grow rapidly. read news Barcelona opened re-education center men toxic masculinity. feel that's good idea could help stop spread covid?

Many people experiencing long term Covid, known. RemindMe! 1 Month would think definition ‚Äúlocked down‚Äù extends beyond amusement parks closed. reality is, US never really ‚Äúlocked down.‚Äù FL vaccination rates UK relied on. UK also required masks indoors week ago. UK proved anything, vaccines working. FL's healthcare system already overburdened, hospitalization deaths lag cases weeks. even cases start falling, plenty dead Floridians. decline seen India, took many lives it. FL perform better India portion state vaccinated, perform worse UK.  change count come number want. CDC specifically tell vaccinated people get tested count non-hospitalized vaccinated brake cases.

Dressings rooms closed theaters open weekends. removed mandate went away back normal completely. Anecdotal, understand heard many similar experiences.  Right I‚Äôm de-facto socially distanced nature rural Wisconsin life. go big wedding. I‚Äôm saying responsible thing none us go Since virus mutates replicates, vaccines work limiting virus's ability replicate body, mean virus fewer chances mutate vaccinated people? This. Last week visited restaurant neighbor country everything normal. masks. markings floor. Nothing. showed certificate vaccine could enter. Everything normal, q-nut people want. refuse either get tested vaccinated thus get back normal. Cat bag, unfortunately. Messaging pendulum issues straight-up confusing others. 


Doubt many go back lot CoVid guidelines spring.  Ooh good point Friend mine got covid even though he's vaccinated. friend (also vaccinated) hung day lunch (outdoors). vaccinated, chances catch it? know fine, testing positive mess plans coming week. covid test CVS detect go tomorrow? least that's argument Jalisco, Mexico. Oh, totally makes sense. think that's really good way express it. 
Thanks clarifying. Show numbers voter's. anti-vaxers making decisions, though. That's problem. They've outsourced thinking politician corporation manipulative entity. Even outside contingent, people want think research. knew something Provincetown. I've delaying reaction alarmist news lately bc I've learned past two years much headlines media really skew story. I've wearing mask got vaccinated. I've also followed whatever social distancing guidelines implemented. Beyond things, I've getting life without issue.

Meanwhile, people preoccupied scared mask. complaining non-stop follow guidelines protect community health. people probably spend significant amount time complaining needing get vaccinated.

But yeah, spending much effort selfish totally getting lives, lmao. That‚Äôs everyone vaccinated telling vaccinated folks need wear masks putting media stories breakthrough infections makes sound common counterproductive approaches evil votes?


I run company I've built rather large nothing. Along way learned always call is. numbers good good, bad bad.

I believe vaccines. Greatest medical accomplishment amongst mankind book. Mrna could even so.


BUT NUMBERS LIE.

I'm OK truth. vote cannot handle truth. Put kool-aid sides join fight FIX problem. HUMAN problem, side. That's division break us see happening here. assholes spread around anyways never get tested unless to. I'm tired subsidizing stupid, want vaccine, foot bill spew plague everywhere. ad hominem attack &amp; ""knowledgeable"" information though...

How ad Hominem attack. *did* cherrypick point context. Moreover, Ben Shipero famous exactly that, insinuating fan pretty reasonable assumption. CDC's pretty slow things since beginning, hate say. advice sometimes wrong vague less useful one would hope. UK might gotten past delta surge hospitalizations came near January peaks even cases high. 

Hopefully US trends same, again, past us vaccination rate. And? You‚Äôve provided one example. Perhaps many others same. maybe 30% business. Idk. It‚Äôs private business feel right. Go there. Don‚Äôt go there. Flying South Louisiana. Flights dirt cheap, that‚Äôs it. Staying Grand Floridian, 8 nights. That‚Äôs like $9k total think. Park tickets another $1,500 $2,000. add another $2k $4k food, drinks, wine, misc charges. reservations diner mostly fine dining. Sure, trip could done cheaper. shit, it‚Äôs vacation. Lol good thing air travel masks required enforced everywhere. you‚Äôre vaxxed, risk worse traveling getting sick prior COVID. NYTimes provides graph region US terms cases/capita compares state highest rates them. awhile Arkansas. Louisiana line basically straight air. Don‚Äôt try make hero. exposed covid cautious? sounds pretty expensive top tbh. proven deadly, last saw pretty inconclusive. Imagine show someone (who never seen ball before) baseball tell ‚Äúball.‚Äù next time see baseball, recognize say ‚Äúball.‚Äù

This ""we think happen"" level, like example mention above, ""this literally physically impossible"" level.

See, side effect talking hormone therapy, requires frequent usage, **over period time**. There's constant physical substance.

That's case vaccine.

The vaccine reagents used within days (perhaps even hours) injection.

The immune response done within weeks.

At point, there's literally nothing inside body capable giving side effect.

Think - would work, mechanistically?

You get say, two Pfizer injections. 3 weeks since final injection. There's literally substance vaccine left inside body. side effect coming from?

3 months?

3 years?

How would work? appearing via magic?

For claiming true, mean group particular scientists wrong, like hormone therapy, would mean biology chemistry physics wrong.

It's totally different standard evidence. huge gamble right Oh shit r/watercoolerwednesday leaking logic care anything kills less people cancer, obesity car crashes. like 3 biggest causes death country... Reynolds attended town hall Heber Springs. vaccinated, meeting sway her. ""They treat like dumb make good decisions family,"" says. ** ""How many people see laying around sidewalks yards dying COVID? Nowhere.""**

If that's threshold accept vaccine, indeed dumb make decisions family. talk like we‚Äôre ‚Äúfirst world‚Äù there‚Äôs lot medieval vibes going covers. 

Sauce: states looking trend.  that's driving factor, first areas they'd be, counties closest border, cases are?

And, matter, showing uniformly states along Mexican border? recently got second dose (Pfizer) buyers remorse honest, I‚Äôm young male health issues, vaccines suppose stop spread latest news seems isn‚Äôt case. case present unvaccinated friends besides vaccine lessen symptoms. Thanks! would great. would even save us money. universal care country much wasted save people killing another months, elderly built society rotting away, often able get bed entire day enoufh funding enough nurses help get every day vaccinated, months we're not. dealing Delta infection now. pretty bad healthy 25m 150 pound individual left bed-ridden close week now. slowly starting feel normal... Tested positive Tuesday.. minor cough chills, testing positive fever, severe stomach pain, cold like symptoms. whatever want, official guidance (and according many actual experts - need now). could option fall. see.  That‚Äôs incredibly optimistic.

I also don‚Äôt agree. think get bad, likely worse before. is, many things dangerous dangerous covid. many people dying disease directly caused smoking obesity? Totally preventable too. 80% population attending festivities would really low estimate. would suspect demographics people attending Bear Week least 90% vaccinated.

The real story event likely would resulted 5000+ infections year ago likely dozen deaths resulted handful severe infections. Depending live well assess want based current spread/vaccination rate. But, since see lots people, may able vaccinated yet/have low response like kids immunocompromised folks, doesn‚Äôt hurt till gets better. wouldn‚Äôt worry health, though. okay get covid. party small government states rights, unless power, case tell do. comparison something like pandemics modern medicine, manageable crisis. agree vaccine mandates fastest way out. Corporate America agrees. might take couple tries, think we'll get there. yeah, diseases serious business deadly consequences. demand respect.

I'm saying easy. abandon hope pretty lame response. disease infectious is, going look lot like chicken pox. Everyone gets eventually, also people gotten infection becomes rare.

Vaccines help mitigate it. could eradicated political mass vaccination N95 on, fine, lol.. I‚Äôm healthy, vaccinated. move Florida California. Wearing mask 90 degrees working hangar absolutely miserable. I‚Äôd rather risk getting mild sickness, personally

Your mild sickness get someone else seriously sick.

I imagine wearing mask hangar must suck. least covid testing /temperature checks work?

I could understand masking work everyone testing daily. one public idea. pulse oximeter result also inaccurate condition like Raynaud‚Äôs.  someone gets covid unvaccinated, die, longer consider problem. point people take responsibility actions. Covid loves places like Arkansas. feel healthcare workers. think biggest annoyance point uncertainty. Pretty much none experts regular people parroting say stuff like ""keep wearing masks even vaccinated!"" offer timetable stop. could offer herd immunity percentage test positivity rate hospitalization rate satisfying enough, I'd much content renewed restrictions.

You want part society, follow rules. excuse bad behavior way, though. fact information vaccines easily accessible. Anyone still refusing get vaccine selfishness cruelty. Like not, point people become responsible actions. 

Also, consider anti-vaxxers primary ones driving COVID deaths US. aren‚Äôt victims. They‚Äôre perpetrators.

Very good news vaccines working intended. assuming future trend based backward looking number ignoring current situation is. would different conversation Florida Rt 1. case things would improving. Rt 1, things yet started improving Florida currently still real bad.

Fundamentally, case study valid random sample makes difficult draw firm conclusions. 125k breakthroughs since what? January?


We've 95k positive cases today, alone. Probably 93k unvaccinated.

Jan 19th 187k new cases alone, one day. 2,700 people dead. Again, unvaccinated, probably 99% point. Right! I'm sick that. Even stupid phrase true, half country overweight. Critics agency like former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, said federal officials failing capture overall scope infection Covid cases. Gottlieb told CNBC Friday, ""I suspect probably one 10 infections actually getting reported."" much much lower chance getting seriously ill. right thing family. Thank you! Thank you!

The fuck? thought point vaccines stop spread?

Nope, point vaccines stop people dying and/or facing severe illness. Sterilizing immunity never trait COVID vaccines, data showed transmission *less* likely occur among vaccinated still case. 

That vaccines reduced transmission well SARS II strains miracle, given fact. Studies show wrong delta. matter read study vaccinated might fueling spread masking symptomatic died day declared endemic Seattle, whatever. need look inward. I've never liked immaturity, childlike nature anything. Also, selfish require much time care another person way. 

I'll never understand people would want crying snivelling shitting snot nosed symbiote around them. get dog. I'm sure big deal, thanks contribution science. knows, maybe study saves lives? hoping CDC would better Biden. may gotten worse. response time anything regarding Delta awful. months data months seeing countries. do??? Removed social distancing masking. waited fucking week bring back half assed please wear mask Delta entrenched every corner country. response time expect CDC going forward future variants may worse Delta FUCKED. audience hardly known empathy realization bad things also happen them. I‚Äôd like think minds change, remain pessimistic. Thanks sharing. Glad you‚Äôre okay. mean, know that? 

How many people get infected every year?  
How many times expect get COVID lifetime, percent chance dying COVID society says that's high? 

I think anyone knows society 100% acquired immunity looks like trying live life normally. Maybe COVID gone -- maybe COVID infects people low rate year spikes winter, due fading immunity, remains low risk overall. Maybe COVID reinfect people quickly year-round fully open society viable. Maybe instead add mask requirements subway indoor gatherings 100, that's takes keep cases exploding. 

I think good idea damaging would allow COVID spread uncontrolled people immunity already, could range anywhere harmless catastrophic. I'm refraining making guesses future, aside ""Booster vaccines happening"", personally! links studies medical journals cite, showing LA/IA vaccines effective mRNA vaccines? iphone Android? Freedom phone? Blame Federal Government low wages federal government determines minimum wages are.

Dont blame employer following law.  rampant population unvaccinated abided mask requirements Couldn‚Äôt even children That's hope well would assume goal vaccines along. hope eradicate covid dangerous narrative needs addressed quickly. great, bob  Equally, inactions consequences. governor override fed, mean mayors override governor? balance power work here? one article said ‚Äúconfirms‚Äù ‚ÄúMay‚Äù sentence. can't expunged bankruptcy lmao.

If get business loan, probably learn much would college. Bank can't repossess knowledge either.

The monetary value college actual degree itself, since knowledge non-quantifiable.

So want make argument, make perspective ""they can't repossess degree.""

So say, let's that. 17 year old got duped 100k loan shitter degree pan out, let file bankruptcy lose degree.

""But degree value bank.""

Neither 99% repossess bankruptcy. 

Furthermore, allowing student loans expunged bankruptcy adds high downside risk giving out.

That means far fewer loans, much lower amounts.

Means college prices plummet.

Loans &amp; insurance general harmful comes medicine, education housing. drive prices exponentially especially they're made widely available. interpretation 30 HIV+ individuals tested positive COVID medications make HIV undetectable. None 30 hospitalized result COVID infection. 

More info undetectable HIV status here: research done topic, could promising sign HIV pre post exposure medications reduce immune response COVID (assuming 30 vaccinated).

Or could completely misreading footnote! Makes ZERO sense!!! We've always war Eastasia. People say every time cases go down. hope right, need see evidence quick reply needing IRS money chat.

Here‚Äôs quote CDC‚Äôs growing body evidence indicates people fully vaccinated mRNA vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna) *less likely* unvaccinated persons *acquire* SARS-CoV-2 transmit others. However, risk SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection fully vaccinated people cannot completely eliminated long continued community transmission virus.

Less likely acquire. Straightforward. Easy understand. studies deal spread well symptoms. positive rapid tests always followed far specific PCR test. need self-isolate two weeks positive rapid test.

We're vaccinated, fact wear masks indoors. going stop living life. said ""go big weddings"". people already postponed weddings nearly 2 years. continue so? blaming personal risk assessment. perfectly valid one obviously fits well. someone different risk assessment make feel pandemic over. see sentiment time Reddit.

Japanese gladly give Texas Gold. wait, DOJ declined proceed, he‚Äôs longer responsible? logic, DeSantis isn‚Äôt responsible anything since DOJ hasn‚Äôt opened investigation handling Covid, right? 

Wow, political tribalism insane here.

You ZERO idea efficacy NPIs like rest scientific flat comparing California Florida? Pretty similar per capita death rates. Different median age population (especially we‚Äôre talking highly age stratified virus) along vastly different NPIs. continue nonsense trying reach pre determined conclusion making every excuse sun states performed differently.

That immunized it. 
50 odd years ago without measures protect spread infection, 10-12. 
As usual CDC failed messaging. taking case peak hospitalization, 2 weeks cases month away. (not particularly educated) instinct probably next summer small numbers people remain totally immunologically naive covid, close everybody either previously infected vaccinated. Covid still around prevalence vary, mostly infect small children, small subset previously exposed, people protection previous infection vaccine. don‚Äôt blame you! hoping might bit grace time.

Yeah generally agree you. Negative efficacy unlikely there's likely stuff going here.

I think base rate fallacy case see argument parroted time. Usually *is* case high % infected/hospitalized/dead vaccinated, case based know.

It COULD ever untangle stuff going (like perhaps sky high vaccination rate well 72% attendees) though. Young stupid apparently. plus anger shouldnt people would arnt vaccinated algorithms social media uses generate ad revenue. 18-49 way big age group... distinction New York New Jersey first places US get hammered, back spring 2020 one knew anything keep transmission control. summer 2020, though, clear masks social restrictions kept people alive, winter 2020-2021, clear vaccinations kept people alive. NY NJ, people died one knew handle situation. Texas, people died people knew handle situation, chose it. Yes. That‚Äôs precisely think everyone exposed immunity one way another.

There‚Äôs gonna another wave CASES school starts. Thankfully current wave cases significantly fewer hospitalizations deaths winter wave. zero, way fewer.

The vulnerable population largely vaccinated. idiots refused vaccines number idiots die idiocy. 

Children can‚Äôt get vaccinated. unvaccinated child probably lower risk vaccinated 50 year old. worried children. Children lower risk Covid seasonal influenza. Children high-risk specific reasons stay home vaccine eligible. won‚Äôt long it‚Äôs small category. can't one breath blame Trump entire crisis immediately absolve governor direct executor decisions made oversight. hypocrisy ludicrous.

As today, Yea, much better adults. lethal replicates much quickly older variants did. Imagine fighting 100 invaders versus 1,000 invaders castle ramparts defenses. Oh, happening. there. fun. Still got it. mention outlying parishes. I'm saying make painful choose stupid. hold veto-proof majority. Close quite.  Like casinos Vegas making employees pay $15 test per week remain unvaccinated, get vaccinated reason get tested weekly hence charge. Basically it‚Äôs saying get vaccinated! point even 50% infected (unlikely) outbreaks could still happen way low herd immunity. article linked places 50% higher end estimates likely much less that. also mentions could certain areas high immunity others much lower meaning plenty opportunities virus spread. would people found it. positive note, could resolve urgent threat national security. long held religious beliefs among minority people don‚Äôt believe penalize.

I doctor personal experience data published government, would say spread among kids still serious them, thankfully You‚Äôre wrong assumption. don‚Äôt know believe everyone NYC antibodies already died? Oh actually, Singapore extended dosing 6-8 weeks May 18. study released July 7, can't included many/any people dosing schedule: way article describes article, says vaccine 69% effective Delta infection 80%-90% symptomatic infection. Unclear second number covering delta though. mean America Looks like made mistake. edited comment. legislation passed specifically state nationally. That‚Äôs exactly article exploring. Good point. mutations probably come fruition spread enough survive

Delta reigned supreme Yup...I think lot unvaccinated thought protected many around vaccinated. 

The CDC can't get even basic notions human psychology right considering they've quite non-subtly trying manipulate view situation encourage vaccination stupidest way possible. No, difference PCR tests (which cost around ~60‚Ç¨ insurances germany ) antigen tests currently around 12‚Ç¨ less including material labor. actually mandated since Monday (at least NRW), work testing center we've much since last Sunday. Sundays evenings rather slow last weeks everybody needs get tested want eat inside restaurants (if eat patio need test right now) we've people come get tested  600,000 Americans dead still big 'Nope'. Now, though.... Maybe anti vax opinions strong footing? quote said 80% population. correct?  That's quite way implemented U.S.

Since companies able mandate vaccinations FDA busy jerking staring shoes officially approve them, companies said employee vaccinated, get tested twice week recognized testing facility **at expense**, show negative results within three days test continue working there. Failure result dismissal.

Currently, Covid test many places runs $100-$150 dollars, that's $200-$300 week tests. 

Lawsuits filed, course, go nowhere, especially 'right work' states Republicans strange reason low income voters worship like Mecca. states, get fired reason all, reason.

I guess we'll see anti-vaxxers deal development.

Between March, 1 July, 21, 95 percent COVID-19 cases Kentucky among unvaccinated 91 percent hospitalizations unvaccinated.
The deaths COVID-19 88 percent unvaccinated Kentucky. Around country, states seeing 97 99 percent COVID-19 deaths unvaccinated.

I'm doctor medical advice. heard correctly. concern get delta variant apparently transmit still. difference (if vaccinated) much much lower chance long term harm health. 

I'm expecting worst case scenario majority vaccinated individuals could get feels like whoopass cold miss couple days work.

Wearing mask addition fully vaccinated lower risk becoming infected, also lower risk transmitting get infected. risk acquiring transmitting virus cannot eliminated. herd immunity vaccination point. going endemic, need accept adapt. I'm sorry loss. Obviously immunocompromised can't get get full care, I'm sorry clearer. parroting tidbits first thing googled really prove anything.

The fact is, minimum wage tied inflation, workers took advantage that. even. many suburban areas US dense deer population quite habituated unafraid remain within feet human daytime activity. secret life deer think name documentary watch prime highlights this. Really? school kids get tested twice per week? That's amazing! We've pattern live, we've close schools, testing school age kids drops dramatically parent wants subject kid uncomfortable nose swab, real incentive already home. However, open school back up, cases sort take quickly expected. Remember Dr. DeFascist Dr. Abbott cured covid, fun times. Great music? lineup mostly trash year. Excluding time NY biggest global hotspot, left large portion population immune natural infection, fair comparison. Thats okay voted Biden‚Ä¶ higher percentage people vaccinated, risk people protected.

This assumption less warranted. Vaxxed people high virus counts presumably spread non vaccinated. That's CDC says mask up.

In words, vaxxing protects vaxxed. Remember number see reduction probability, compared unvaccinated person similar circumstances. 90% efficacy means vaccine could probability infection 20% 2% (if location raging epidemic behaving carefully) 1% 0.1% (if location cases control). 

With 8 16 week gap doses, Pfizer efficacy almost 90%. small penalty using less effective 3 week gap, know exactly big is. Israel data shows 40%, given selection bias study, treated lower bound - likely pretty close 90%, absolute worst case scenario 40%.  better optimist pessimist together truth probably middle. Feigl-Ding predicted Delta going big problem earlier Topol. know fact grid outside Texas stronger resilient. [That‚Äôs matter public interesting. far I'm concerned long hospitals okay cases better, unfortunate sign progress people refuse get vaccinated.

This encourages future variants reset progress zero worse. Herd immunity infection never achieved. God damn right. People refuse *free* vaccine hook every dime medical expenses (not if) get covid. becomes simple choice free prevention financial ruin. Plus studies showing antibodies delta decrease high risk people Manufacture says resolved issues.  


Still waiting final inspection. ""The present report published line paragraph 5.2.3 EUL Procedure

Here‚Äôs key takeaway: wear mask. 

‚ÄúThe CDC study found vaccinated individuals similar amount virus presence unvaccinated, suggesting that, unlike variants, vaccinated people infected Delta variant could transmit virus, CDC said.

CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said ""pivotal discovery"" leading CDC's recommendation week masks worn areas cases surging precaution possible transmission fully vaccinated people.‚Äù They‚Äôre using mRNA technology create treatment remyelination MS patients. üëèüèªüëèüèª Yep. mom absorbed stuff. doesn‚Äôt watch much news since dad tv large parts day picks rhetoric. keep telling even factor pandemic it‚Äôs puny comparison number American citizens spreading bit own.

I truly hate network. made rage profitable business model it‚Äôs festering like cancer. Funny, article went different headline regarding yet peer reviewed study. article 18 months vaccine effectiveness drops 50%. arguing boosters. want tell protect family's health that's completely right choice so, seem bit overkill want check family's O2 levels. 

If vaccinated, doubly protected; highly unlikely catch corona, even one unlucky enough, vaccine also protects severe cases. believe vaccinated, especially continue wear masks, risk severe illness corona becomes negligible. I'd worried risk driving car highway point. 

But again, harm gaining peace mind. Even so, want protect family, think would better making sure continue following necessary precautions mask wearing good hygiene. wish best :) Masks tricky FL, stores allowed mask policies, rarely enforced, county says masks optional school says full mask policy, parents going fucking nuts. target one stores actually enforced masks point around me, (FL one states soany fist fights masks stores say ""for safety employees enforce mask policy"" fucking backwards sounds happened here,) Publix (grocery store) made efforts always maskless people store. would guess schools mask mandates rarely enforced, counties nothing.

Pre-delta least Point vaccine help keep dying.. stop sick contagious. know experience mysterious is. COVID last month, wife, slept bed two weeks positive never COVID. even possible everything tell us COVID fills room? 3 colleagues got COVID none wives partners even though slept bed didnt isolate other. I'm scientist everything I've told COVID real life experience COVID.

I believe conspiracy scientists lying. believe virus bit difficult handle told. downvoted? like chapter 1 statistics 101 vaccinated still gives 75% reduction chances infection. That‚Äôs 97% study data, beats flu shot significant amount. 

And do, it‚Äôll milder less dangerous. 

My parents age yours. mom got it. She‚Äôs recovered now, mildly sick. Dad didn‚Äôt catch it. agree you. Options need everyone situations same. employers give damn though  apartment complex making us wear masks now. Gotta love protect anti vaxxers! never cold ?? Yes Europe coming towards end vaccination campaign, pfizers become available. doubt UK 10 million Pfizer stock 6 weeks ago.. Yeah, likely bit lower year, PTown wildly different group people average, even average. highly liberal gay summer party (small!) town. people going PTown going chill beach - they're going party.

It would surprise 95% vaccinated overall tens thousands people exposed, resulting kind ridiculously amazing efficacy vs delta.

The problem data many people exposed, everything looks scary. Even cell tower pings could give us ballpark many people there. Good thing vax 90-95% effective preventing infections. CDC says ‚Äúcount‚Äù‚Ä¶. equally susceptible catching it?

No. fully vaccinated person least 80% less likely develop symptomatic case covid compared unvaccinated person. then, get sick, much less likely go hospital. survival rate goes 99 99.9 get less symptoms thought more...MAYBE population density? VA big city like Boston. Similarly, San Francisco, one highest vaccination rates US, cases exploding (like really bad). VA mostly non-urban, NoVa dense, little state overall truly urban.

MA also horrible outbreaks previous spikes, SF -- perhaps SF imploding right despite high vax rates -- immunity previous infection might keep Delta wave lower overall? Coupled almost one SF afford live alone given housing market? Yep, going convince people vaccines don‚Äôt work  Yep. reason think died kids.

These idiots get culled one way another, love see it. idiots. Uh, corresponds cases ~4 weeks ago, 1/6 now. CFR dropped 1-2% (assuming we're testing less) IFR could dropped even further, deaths always going percentage cases. Indeed! üòÇ FWIW they're 32 21 great relationship despite big gap. Hang there! Though percent substantially rising due Delta. Literally anything touching face causes reaction, masks fit tightly inorder work. Like scarves always issue, turtlenecks, etc. things go like UK Netherlands, states nearing peak. I've spoken online person four people gotten first vaccine shot past week two. asked question: ""Why suddenly now?"" One thing common Delta variant everything heard weighed lot decision.

So think stories getting some. GoFundMe.

You're Deep Shit.  people fucking insane, I'm scared unvaccinated twat, that's coming someone 2 doses. Frankly, smart. you‚Äôre motivated tad clever, absolutely secure third shot given current mechanics shots distributed US.

Nope, that's perfectly valid way test.

Nasopharyngeal tests, long swab stuck deep nose, preferred earlier pandemic based early research.

They've generally replaced nasal tests studies found shallow swab nostril good detecting disease much less invasive.

Example study showing good agreement: can't say possibility knowing long-term side effects vaccines they've around months. that's huge issue.

My worry they'll keep creating booster booster even know impacting people's bodies time, there's definitive way attribute particular health issue specifically vaccine. always say ""well, health issues could attributed number things."" love armchair moral crusaders typing ""Good. Actions consequences"" fat fingers using people's demise sort weird self serving vindication. 

Go heat insta mac n cheese u losers. Yeah kind funny one major confounder.

It happened ""Bear Week"". US 49% fully vaccinated, UK 56%. much better. place I'm paying attention right UK, given sudden rise fall wave there. Looks like numbers might going back up, unfortunately, weird one. Bill Gates never even knew location! Yeah- kids getting vaccinated within months. Makes sense conservative little longer. case pre-Delta. Delta different ancenstral strains many ways. true  **Is information adjuvants used various vaccines?**

A friend child responded badly previous (non-covid) vaccine, avoiding vaccine family.

I would like provide real information risk associated adjuvants COVID-19 vaccines. Especially mRNA ones, favorites. even kids thought makes stomach hurt. Even goofy? anti vaccine doses storage believed 5-10m Pfizer 1m Moderna, Pfizer delivery rate sufficient needs. agree, Biden used strategy Trump testing. I've heard via [This Week FDA grant full approval vaccines without something like two years efficacy data; come context people really understanding ""full FDA approval"" really means. safety data continue collected vaccines main phase 3 clinical trials done, sounds like primary purpose current waiting *efficacy* data, *safety* data. (And FDA revoke either Emergency Use Authorization full approval risks drug/vaccine turns riskier implied clinical trials. See happened non-vaccine examples latter.)

Note: re-watched [the TWiV episode somebody knows approval drugs, vaccines, diagnostic tests (her hour-long interview starts 39:20 overall pretty interesting) particular question addressed notice it. Well, 94.7% everything Florida sort scam, surprised. yet four hospitalizations

These partying tourists. many would hospitalized died vaccinated all? Four hospitalizations like 1% nearly total. Sounds good ü§∑ grocery store, woman told nervous getting vaccine rumor internet make magnetic. ""I said, really believe that? said, 'Well, I'm sure.'""

JFC! causing major displacements anywhere variants? actual data comes that‚Äôs it‚Äôs evasive delta beta need shut up. Focus actually spreading worldwide (as fit). Yes whether like not. unvaccinated people get it, likely virus mutates something bypass vaccines. Delta already half-way point. Explain calculation attributing deaths Governors.

Are blaming every single COVID death baseline? terms per capita deaths, Florida well Governor‚Äôs listed states. Mayor's breaking laws trying save people

I'm OOTL. about?  Texas decision ban mask mandates made basis polling data topics relevant Republican primary voters. that's great should. arm even get sore? Okey made answer seems banned incivility saying read everything based strawman heck downvotes promoting others get vaccinated wear masks? don‚Äôt get sub sometimes. think lot us feel sad trapped. do. love lost faith people decent right thing. WRT kids - brilliant people worked never gone college home schooled. Florida never goes Blue. Look Inslee Seattle done. He's pissed Boeing they've considering pulling WA long time now. Seattle socialist caused Amazon move partial operations Bellevue.
Either one leaves state entirely cripple WA long time. Boeing already started. moved 787 production SC. 

Florida least understands money comes acts accordingly. Washington eggs one basket constantly rattles basket. hope time tell, appreciate information although article bit dated doesn‚Äôt include new CDC report. It‚Äôs tough battle whole vaccine campaign built ‚Äústopping spread‚Äù giving vulnerable population great chance living, second statement definitely true. stopping spread sure anymore. seems need let thing run course vaccinated not. 

Then bullshit vaccines potentially help mutate virus multiple times grow complex time. What. The. Fuck workplaces schools united states require certain vaccines. care health, no. Yeah, that's fact life accept. believe alternative? still believe we're going eradicate thing? Somewhere 40 60 infection, somewhere 70-80s symptoms. Leave fabricate protected class unvaccinated-by-choice. directed consumer protection, others FL ban requirement, extending employees well. personal believe based on?? Please cite evidence. law enforcement! maybe (park ranger)daughter get vaccinated stop worrying her. Comfortable, drinking much, regular exercise gym According it‚Äôs hoax flu much worse, also deadly virus created lab China sent undocumented immigrants Democratic Party ü§ö me. Pro-tip, won‚Äôt. % immunity provide now? full faith India‚Äôs data completely accurate reporting /s They'll probably everything online, yeah first thing makes sense speculation. Vaccinated people, prior study coming out, might less likely get tested believe they‚Äôre bulletproof vaccine assume symptoms common cold allergies. make kind speculation ways. really need data CDC others make sense study guess CDC uninterested so. delta seems 1-3% ive read, original strain read anywhere .1 2% depending region Think way. Let‚Äôs say study workers hospital vaccinated.

If say breakthrough cases population 100% vaccinated people would sound bad didn‚Äôt know 100% vaccinated. 

See mean? interesting read timely reminder can‚Äôt take things granted different populations. Ottawa one city. rules situation different every province. Ontario delta, not. never really took here, cases spreading here. everything open months. Ottawa 2 hour drive too, distance thing. Wtf talking about? Texas still fewer covid deaths per capita New York. Maybe don‚Äôt blindly believe clickbait titles Florida resident lol - pass definitely blackout dates. used called ‚Äúseasonal‚Äù think it‚Äôs called something else - Silver maybe? Maybe $30 month - seems like way though. ‚Äúcrisis standards care‚Äù implemented happen. vents. ARDS COVID patient proned likely going make it. pull vent trauma case comes intervention promising survival. Lord help us get point (luckily avoided initial 2020 surge). might need transplant eventually, said.

Much like drinkers need liver transplant, unvaccinated people last line organs. entirely preventable necessary personal choices. Cigarette smoking responsible 480,000 deaths per year USA. 600k covid deaths USA. force people get vaccine can't force smoke? agree too. Right there's areas real concern though yet seems like we're pushing policy national level across areas. 

Frankly think CDC confusing public media happy help. seems like lot people still illusion eradicate thing something. 

I think would go long way CDC would come say actual plan is/what future holds. path forward see, I've accepted this. 

IDK CDC concerned public backlash say this, maybe they're going slow boil will, maybe much internal direction (kinda looks like unfortunately). Ofc I'm expert, maybe see something don't, sure wish would share it. absence better knowledge we're left work available. guess telling endgame they're trying achieve would good start. imagining coronavirus lowering risk like flu? want 0 cases deaths period weeks? think people imagine post-pandemic world leads they're telling others do. person wants one die virus anymore likely chastise vaccinated people unmask, ibstance. Yeah lot holding sometimes feel obligated wait everyone else look like asshole who‚Äôs team player. said, I‚Äôm still happy union always pro union. customer service good time place might tell 1, 2 people; bad time tell EVERYONE. 

I like think every person saying know breakout case, there's 99 posting know one. Control shit India produce another variant stronger delta country Europe never mask mandates? really hope ca officials sensible dont institute lockdown instead require businesses choose remain open requires customers/staff prove vaccination status negative tests every 72 hrs. Yes. feeling still think polling online type males complying covid rules research treated scientific work. ICU doctors ability tell this. We‚Äôve seen reports claiming similar things thoughtojt last several months every new strain every time turns overhyped cause ICU workers see severe cases large scale data. Delta definitely worse vaccines still highly effective reducing transmission severe covid. that's longer enough

It's hard say anything ever ""enough"", theory there's always could (like say could lockdown forever that's practical). However, vaccinations huge impact deaths (and people dying, rather getting infected, ultimtely anyone cares covid). know one. Father friend. gentleman retirement age. did, democrats sure going lose 2024 election. much politics public health. 

300,000 people die obesity every year CDC , elected officials media jack shit it. article:

""The CDC study found vaccinated individuals similar amount virus presence unvaccinated, suggesting that, unlike variants, vaccinated people infected Delta variant could transmit virus, CDC said.
CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said ""pivotal discovery"" leading CDC's recommendation week masks worn areas cases surging precaution possible transmission fully vaccinated people.""

It also 79% vaccinated people got Covid-19 study, symptoms, 4 hospitalized.

I recommend reading whole article. think said studied 469 people outbreak? statement true. ""normal"" vaccine, sure getting info. primes pump. US, 97% hospitalisations unvaccinated 99.5% deaths. people wonder prefer living (high cost living) state...

It looks like employer going allow permanent WFH I'm contemplating moving VHCOL area HCOL area. Since ~30% coworkers antivax tiptoe carefully around answering the, ""Why move South Dakota Oklahoma Kentucky? That'd like 100% raise!!"" question. scenario, 5-10% raise 100% raise long-term quality life. Mandates  Good. Kids rightfully shouldn‚Äôt forced wear masks. zero risk covid. don‚Äôt like quit !!!! pay shit anyways!!  way public health officials encourage better eating habits, mandating workout regimes minimum dosage vitamin people things would better. No, opposite fact, start telling truth. COVID long haul feeling never done research, idea done, never published, never written grant application, never deal grant compliance officers. correct feeling? interested vax worth nice, simple explanation: involved explanation: safe friends! save turmeric favorite curry recipe! many people wander though woods touching leaves? receptor virus uses enter cells, ACE2, conserved (similar) across mammalian species, enough interspecies similarity allow viral infection.  Sounds like good idea! Good luck job, hope everything goes alright. Lmao that‚Äôs cute think companies aren‚Äôt going lay people furlough rent going cancelled stimulus checks going get time. country incapable supporting everyone event lockdown. We‚Äôre talking disapproving daughter‚Äôs college major here. daughter could get hurt die, kill someone. Dew Higher penalty please!!!!!  I'm double vaxxed (Canadian) way hell would go Florida right now. waited year half live music return, followed rules, got vaccine soon possible. Breakthrough cases rare, I'm done sacrificing seeing friends family seeing music, two loves life, behalf unvaccinated covid deniers. I'll continue exercise caution can, heart goes healthcare workers deal shit.  friend, height pandemic. RemindMe! 10 Days Better late never. Would preferred got months ago. implicit equalization vaccines masks. One lot important other. Ah see, makes lot sense then.  thing start happen Missouri Florida 2 weeks peak everyone shocked cause mask mandate restrictions. CDC report leaked showed Delta variant far infections ancestral slightly deadly. infectious similar capacity chicken pox whereas ancestral infectious similar th common cold.

That's problem, people get infected require direct care (intubation, beds, monitoring, etc) deaths increase services longer provided readily. want know looks like, check videos India month ago families stood lines outside hours loved one died gurneys arms. see dispair hospital workers, families people working funeral pyres around clock.

Gov Abbott looking strong race bottom exactly 90%, many confounding factors, age main one. use country's 69% infection 90% symptoms, already around 75% first dose 60% second dose (similar UK numbers). Despite numbers, we're facing quite large outbreak past month. Teachers unions don‚Äôt bargaining power Texas. lose jobs attempting strike.

Living Alberta, confirm don‚Äôt give fuck Covid. opinion it‚Äôs fucking anti vaxxers going cause problems. ‚ÄúWhat Muh freedoms!‚Äù ‚Äúthere‚Äôs gonna deaths vaccine watch!‚Äù attitude 1/5 us. 

Personally I‚Äôm pretty disgusted selfish society.  close back square one.

Only let get complacent way Australia did. ""Who cares fast people getting vaccinated? Cases low right everything's fine!""

The end goal always getting many people vaccinated possible, knew needed *at least* 70% eligible population fully vaccinated getting herd immunity. Delta, cases dropping, vaccinations stalling people instead still fretting wearing masks caring US raising nationwide vaccination rates. Basically, lost sight forest trees came back bite us rear. Bachelorettes gonna bachelorette. pedal carts pedal themselves.  Right chomo. always wondered Russians spell it. do, they‚Äôre currently negotiating unions. It‚Äôll probably happen soon. guess legal... now.

Federal law says employers require vaccinations. yeah. 100% we're keeping kids home upcoming school year. Everyone else thinks we're overreacting. That's fine. Good luck bring Covid home all. wish would. agree, absolutely blame parent choosing return school. many vulnerable students don‚Äôt choice need CDC state government unwilling to. higher income districts funding virtual learning programs means. union bargaining power Texas, would picket line. know 12 people breakthrough covid  Nashville. bars stay open, tourists yuppies go droves. teach on? Honest question I‚Äôm worried teachers. 72% come from? vaccination rate Percent cases vaccinated higher vaccination rate terrible news face value. I'm open (desperate for, actually) arguments take face value, outlier, etc., talk base rate fallacy whatever case percent cases vaccinated HIGHER vaccination rate? face value implies negative efficacy.

That's thing; negative efficacy unlikely. So, else going on?

This may outlier - social norms may different state. Let's say clubs, bars, events etc allow fully vaccinated individuals. case number low (\~400) could super spreader event two vaccine-only venues result number cases.

I'm saying impossible there's something *bad* happening here, I'm stating much likely there's another explanation results. example, unvaccinated people much less likely take covid test. Try think terms probability. What's probability less sinister explanation? would say, stands, probability high. Unless see many studies different places data similar this, worth stressing about. That‚Äôs inalienable rights work friend. one right put others danger. Additionally, people disabled protections law says right part society least restrictive way possible. obligation stop danger lies people behaving dangerously. Stop victim blaming shaming. too. tickets Bonnaroo going absolutely crushed gets cancelled. Manchester good shot giving us another variant. Touch√© Trying find next Tucker Carlson talking point July 50 7500‚Ä¶ Every time someone says ""stop spread"" need replace ""slightly slow spread."" We're obviously going stop thing. Lockdowns stop last winter, less contagious variant.

So ask yourself, purpose, point time, slightly slowing spread? give time vaccines developed distributed. goal now? 

I'm saying there's good answer question, need answer it. Spanish Flu part deux Gotta feeling won‚Äôt sex every night average festival lol context lockdowns, restrictions, masks: no, there‚Äôs currently scientific evidence effective.

In context sending infected patients back nursing homes: probably yes.

If argue opposite you‚Äôd use baseline like said somehow make absurd statement ‚Äúevery COVID death global pandemic directly attributable Governor state‚Äù. visiting beaches packed right now. Restaurants too. hour wait get table first night reservations fully booked week. Lmao, already know people ""secondhand directly"" doctored vaccination records get What's onion?

Is though? someone deserve *die* made poor selfish decision, based massive misinformation campaign victims? There's much difference ""I got mine, forget you"" mindset proliferate here.

The whole reason pandemic prolonged people thinking mindset ""personal responsibility"". need recognize interdependence rather fetishizing independence. We, vaccinated, cannot get pandemic without help unvaccinated. much fact needing vaccine first place. gotten vaccine, civic duty help understand civic responsibility get heads ""personal responsibility"" butts. need find ways empathize help make decisions help end pandemic.

Empathy harder getting vaccine, yes, necessary save lives. Article: one dose Pfizer/BioNTech jab offering 36% protection symptomatic disease

My takeaway would you‚Äôre likely get heart problems Covid vaccine. year half life completing standing still, finally taking vacation two weeks. Kind feels like worst timing ever (everything groovy booked) can‚Äôt waste another year life. I‚Äôm vaxxed plan mask indoors. Anyone else boat? Gunna feel weird getting plane sure. 180 people g-g-g-g-g-GADOOSHED RemindMe! 3 Weeks Yeah guess real way know vaccination status people potentially exposed virus outbreak. They'd figure identifies every resident (this study covered residents) attended events vaccination status. Hotel airbnb records would go far.

At least feel better case CDC knows want tell us. gonna even think new lock down.

The lockdown work. 

Cancel large events, require masking public transit, masking public general, close schools large local outbreaks. That's enough. ""lockdown."" cases dropped 33% testing dropped 14%, means cases dropping simply due less testing. positivity rate dropping also backs up. Still: PERFECT setting easy way get tested would result self-quarantine fewer cases stop spreading.

Risks dont outweigh consequences 40- yo proven statistics THUSFAR.  Netherlands vaccinated half million people dancing janssen thing initially seemed like flop hindsight looks like may helped 163M vaccinated people. Among vaccinated people little less 6600 reported hospitalizations deaths, 75% persons 65.

*Right now* 10,000 hospitalized COVID patients Florida alone, 2000 ICU. There‚Äôs almost 6300 Texas alone. Louisiana: 1750. Georgia: 2200. Tennessee Arkansas thousand each.

Compared states 70% vaccinated:

Connecticut: 120; Massachusetts: 200; New Jersey: 520. You‚Äôd end nurse ICU bed too.    vacation Florida beaches packed. anything, people average visiting right now. We're year 2 ""wait next summer"". something cannot perpetuated long period time. finite time life continuing expect people sacrifice happiness years unrealistic. That's even taking account millions people work industries rely money made pay bills. methods available protect something interested. also free shelter place feel comfortable reintroducing society. data clear point risk, risk factors are, virus spread, maintain healthy lifestyle protect virus encounter. Humans lived world risks point, one virus dismantle line thinking.  guess little confused saying ""at hospital"" since seem refer one hospital. [The release article referring says 117 ICU beds filled 7/30 16 left, meaning 133 88% capacity. Particularly alarming since case numbers seem leveling anytime soon we've seen hospitalizations lag behind cases.

Can't personally comment ""want"" 85% filled, info handy? quick google tells ICUs consider 85% capacity ""functionally full"" can't really handle keep beds open sudden-event emergency patients like trauma heart attack. 100% agree. make joke. It‚Äôs point  wrong. know common. 

For example, 20% reinfection within 6 months healthy young Respectfully disagree. dunno, rapid test topic seems one biggest failures response crisis.

It serves exactly two purposes: politicians talk kind ""fairness"" everyone vaccinated, resourceful people opening test sites earn truckload money really quickly, without anything all. Israel high vaccination rate people still ending hospital.  see tsunami unvaccinated clogging healthcare system bad places people WANT medical care can‚Äôt get it. 

I‚Äôd pissed I‚Äôm taking care knuckleheads people suffer die waiting ambulance even preventative care. LA County, herd immunity earlier year everyone got infected (50% residents). 

Guess what? immunity faded large daily cases again. super dumb idea. might well say going stop testing unvaccinated. ever charged vaccine wouldnt fucking pay it. Let fix 2021:

Vaccinated men less likely comply Covid restrictions find punishing part, study suggests. got mine, told Tylenol combat symptoms post vaccine fine disagree, they're committing fraud state knowingly putting others danger. Honestly fines I've seen (1500 euros one article) dissuasive enough either. believe life choices, ...this hand ? infection rate vaccinated unvaccinated people Massachusetts? Holy shit looks like found blue haired loser wild lmao Im fully vaccinated know I‚Äôm risk delta variant. I‚Äôm pissed morons refuse vaccine. Honestly, don‚Äôt care happens them. care kids high risk. Best friends grandchild diagnosed cancer. He‚Äôs 4 can‚Äôt take vaccine. Neither twin brother 10 year old brother. idiot run around infecting kids go school covid infect 10 others. true American what‚Äôs best country himself. true, vaccinated person privilege entitlement go outside live life. feel privilege entitlement tell to? free stay inside limit movement want, concern me. work couple home schooled folks, would strongly disagree 'no ' issues. Mind sharing source? far found research immigration level exit fee. news, study confirmed water wet. clue role rna is, you? 

This ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù first kind. no, it‚Äôs normal like 40 vaccines. 

It‚Äôs mistaken works. point you‚Äôve called deliberately spreading dangerous false information. Exactly. Masks eliminate virus. get immunized one way other. still wear masks places. cant enter without masks.  start wearing mask work Monday feel fucking defeated. Fully vaxxed month loving everything returning normal, completely crushed this. CDC sending wrong message fully vaxxed people mask up, exactly anti vaxxers want see. gives validation skepticism regarding vaccine ""well vaxxed people still get sick/spread covid mask up, get it?"". Where's incentive encourage people get now?

I everything fucking right entire year. always wore mask whenever required, see friends 6 months peak pandemic, got vaccinated soon could. I'm done point can't help start think virus controlling people. I've followed every fucking rule supposed allow return back normal life seems nowhere sight. Somehow 48th 50 education unforeseen consequences. There‚Äôs legit study (I‚Äôll see find link) concludes chance dying jumping airplane without parachute. 

The kicker method: plane ground even running.  here- lucky enough single family member friend (knowingly) get COVID. curiosity, vaccinated caught it? happy catch it. luck, pandemic guys shots immunity.

Edit: judgment wasn't, curiosity. one direction. 
Also, looked up, there's apparently much larger fee leave air, build price airline ticket never see it. According statistica, Texas pop density 39.54 people per square mile. New York 410.32. 

The combined population (2019 estimate) Houston 2,320,268, San Antonio 1,327,407, Dallas 1,1,343,573, Austin 978,908, 5,970,156. population New York City 8.3 million. (estimated numbers lazy sources) UK hospitalization rate 1 100k Delta versus 35 100k last winter outbreak Pfizer Moderna similar enough roughly interchangeable.

4 shots mRNA vaccines would massive overkill. new study showed getting third mRNA dose 6 months second beneficial. mean necessary, mean third dose 3 weeks later beneficial. Delays important vaccinating.

Combining different types vaccines often effective either alone, could true combining J&amp;J mRNA. However, tested.

Your safest option 2 doses mRNA, well demonstrated highly effective.

From UK, know gap 8-12 weeks gives better long term immunity. 3 (Pfizer) 4 (Moderna) week gap gives better short term immunity getting second dose faster, officially recommended US. would go 3 4 week gap, since case counts currently high boosters probably available later needed. See! lived. whole thing overblown. assholes **laughs Schizoid** Could sweet spot terms age, 2 y/o kind wants whatever do. wear mask, wants one. She‚Äôs got bunch fun dinosaur masks.  Took long enough. lot good info vaccine safe effective. Thanks. What‚Äôs different last year? place see death rates changed related vaccine distribution ventilator use? friend says people killed ventilators, decrease usage ventilators largely responsible drop deaths COVID. course. Community spread really limited much vaccine, even though still prevents serious illness. Look happened Provincetown, - lots positives sick people, even among 74% vaccinated group people. 74%, 79% symptoms. However, seven hospitalizations deaths thus far. means vaccinated people still spread virus even get sick well, mild symptoms. 

Distancing masking tools know work given absence vaccinations creating herd immunity. Close 161m people refused vaccine consequence that. can't wash hands situation got vaccinated, would put us risk well.  would consequences UK similar beginning pandemic new vaccines developed rolled also noted increased concern regarding Beta Gamma variants virus given ability ‚Äòreinfect people efficiently‚Äô therefore increase potential new variants emerge among people already contracted group went recommend steps reduce chance either scenario including UK continuing support rollout current vaccines worldwide, reducing transmission All-Party Parliamentary Group on¬†Coronavirus, report originally published start week made public UK government today one eleven reports coronavirus government parliament Philippa Whitford MP, Vice-Chair group said:¬†‚ÄúThis report, sent shock waves UK Government, instead quietly snuck among glut reports parliamentary comments made SAGE bring home simple reality - yet ‚Äòdefeated‚Äô UK donated first vaccine doses internationally week and, unless rapid increase global production, sharing knowledge technology, simply possible vaccinate the¬†world¬†and bring pandemic stricter border control measures risk importing vaccine-resistant variants uncontrolled spread could lead yet another UK government mustn‚Äôt stick head sand run risk un-doing progress made past eighteen Martin McKee CBE, London School Hygiene Tropical Medicine Independent SAGE added:¬†‚ÄúThese stark words Government‚Äôs advisors underlines many us warning confirms still obstacles government can‚Äôt complacent, must continue support development next generation vaccines prioritise reduction infections home reduce possibility another domestic variant emerging.‚Äù
¬† Yeah I‚Äôm trying take kid risky places avoid she‚Äôs nearly 3 happily enough wear mask asked. Kids understand quite bit young age - explain it‚Äôs safe near people, mask too. Children can‚Äôt, however, wear surgical cloth mask protection bit limited. Same. son supposed start preschool August 10th. pretty obvious ? \- Sweden

\- Norway 

\- Denmark 

\- Finland

There recommendations wear mask certain situations, like using public transports. Best knowledge never enforced law (but could wrong) - Sweden recommended masks public transports, periods day regions short period time, nothing else (i.e. shopping, eating, walking public spaces always possible without wearing mask) 

It works social distance place 15 months. Sorry, someone else practically accused saying it, clear meant all. Perfect evolutionary conditions forthcoming Epsilon variant. think autobot misfired one, triggered keyword context. Name one state doesn‚Äôt immunization registry. Even Texas immunization registry. Reading comments thinking DIY third shot American thing ever. I'll likely Oct-Nov tbh. That‚Äôs good fuck Disney. R value 7? jesus. Ah. Bridge toll. *really* think danger posed Delta understated. Telling truth may hurt vaccine messaging, sure, stretching truth serve public‚Äôs best interest going destroy credibility breed loony conspiracy theories. learn nothing first mask debacle lied protect medical PPE access? 

Vaccines still offer personal protection, even outward protection potentially limited now.

We fully vaccinated household, 3 us currently symptomatic breakthrough infection. fourth getting tested. cases serious.

I almost admitted last night. feel like without vaccine I‚Äôd goner. 

I know I‚Äôll look like dork, household, wearing masks. men get pregnant too. exclude them? Reading comment section article puts dark &amp; scary place. come Nordics seeing common defiance science many western countries alarming. really cannot afford superstitious populists anymore critical global problems facing moment diseases environment. think that's better analogy vaccine (though still great).

The mask like ""everyone needs stop sex might sleep someone might sleep someone wear want wear condom."" think Florida pretty decently maybe mid September well. It‚Äôs delta wave infectious antivax antimask crowd probably enough natural immunity rates drop. look hit India burned couple months.

In meantime vaccinated deaths. enjoy dead, personally.

Edit: happy cake day! Yeah, also fat people shouldnt receive health care cause enormous cost society self inflicted health issues  Can‚Äôt get brain damage don‚Äôt brain‚Ä¶ interesting figure percentage cases vaccinated versus unvaccinated people. example, half people vaccinated half cases among vaccinated people, vaccine nothing prevent cases.

Of course, going case counts, also interested severity, seems much lower among vaccinated people, good thing. Alright I'll bite. downvoted? Joe Rogan get vaccinated yet? lives Austin he's propagating kinds anti-vax shit. zip codes state low vaccination rate seem either Democrat Republican. don‚Äôt think political party thing regards vaccination. mask mandates sure vaccination. UK study showed two things; 1) CFR delta much lower variants. 2) length delta outbreak much short lived variants (approximately 36 day peak another 36 trough) Vaccination added measure? No. Vaccination primary measure. Masking public secondary measure. Everything else control low list almost irrelevant.

Millions non-obese, non-diabetic people India died disease. Italy supposedly eat ‚Äúhealthy Mediterranea diet‚Äù largest death rate Europe. Water ""wet"". ""Wet"" property water bestows things. frustrating. teacher father 7 month old daughter, happy eager get vaccine. still stayed away indoor gatherings tried go stores still wear mask. I'm pissed. Getting vaccine never me. daughter. delta going TEAR schools im going get exposed potentially bring home infect daughter. sucks makes feel like saying fuck it. Im done fighting thing. Whatever happens, happens. Im getting booster every 4 months new variant comes breaks through. going happen. names indeed included? It‚Äôs weird people mentioning politics, ‚ÄúTexas learned, gov stupid people didn‚Äôt‚Äù. forgot California similar pattern waves cases, different political voting pattern. comes politics I‚Äôm afraid. 

Also, go worldometer look charts. Eerily, many places current wave hitting almost exact spots 1st wave now. found observation interesting (visually, perfect didn‚Äôt scroll individual days phone). many extroverted people comply Covid restrictions. 

I think likely combo ""self-centred ignorant"" did. know sounds dumb Disneyland one higher paying entry jobs here. paying $15 target walmart still $12/13 post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Don't shit. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:
  
[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* bizarre people still this. People cheering Texas Florida approach last year posts agedlikemilk ghoulish ""yeah look much fewer deaths unlike NYC haw haw"" like cheering deaths fellow Americans football game something. *Fox News entered chat* 2 groups people:
- locals live community, pay taxes, address, easy find, speak English know hundreds thousands Americans died something get vaccine refuse vaccinate mask freedom!
- unknown number migrants, don‚Äôt know are, can‚Äôt easily get vaccine may already vaccinated (yes keep assuming they‚Äôre don‚Äôt actually know that)

Which group make sense focus on?
The whole ‚Äúwho cares Texans refuse vaccinate push laws masking illegal immigrants may vaccinated too‚Äù silly. Next time see illegal immigrant claiming vaccines mind control scheme bill gates government government right ask us take basic precautions help protect fellow citizens let know! Kill. Your. Self. California QR code. also option upload directly Google Pay card. check see state anything similar. agree. nationally, right last year lead holiday surge. surge high higher Jan/Feb 21 peak. think question long take. models showing burn peak next 60 days. Yikes. awesome. Thank blessed wonderful day!  New York stopped counting long time ago.  Exactly. Old folks still old, people still ride motorcycles without helmets, people still accidents get shot, people even talk back grandma. Lots ways end ICU adding Covid mix. r/redditmoment one dose vaccine, J&amp;J not, seem give full protection. like J&amp;J different AZ, decided test one dose original strain since enough back then.

I think time stop calling one dose J&amp;J full vaccination, really isn't: It‚Äôs funny foster care take TB test came back positive get chest X-ray. doctor says exposed it. Korea. said everyone comes positive tb test there. 20 years ago old might case Korea anymore. Great excuses. doesnt refute anything said. 

Why take extra risks dont to? wait till know more.

If Obese (or high risk covid disease) old take it. risk getting covid suffering indeed high. healthy 40- yo theres valid reason take yet. Like stated above. 

""Yea imma take high risk vaccine cause car ride kill aswell"".

Such shit take unreal.. wearing mask much issue extremely privileged.  I‚Äôve read elsewhere Reddit false. stopped tracking/following breakthroughs they‚Äôre still counting even without hospitalization.  reduces chance getting infected, reduces chance bring home daughter. course not, headline sensationalized make appear Texas fuck state terms dealing COVID actually better average juncture. Look San Francisco....highest vaccinated rate USA currently high hospital occupancy positive rates going fast.

We need realize black white, vaccinated versus unvaccinated, humans together. sorry excuse leaders (here TEXAS) almost everywhere hurting us. Show human rights document says this. problem is, CDC ""guidance"" honor system, Americans far honorable. Ventilation...

Please keep mind extremely rare apartment buildings central air serving multiple apartments. even central air split system implemented, it‚Äôs usually providing multiple zones circulation within single apartment; that‚Äôs practically opposite sharing air apartments, let alone floors.

Older buildings (1960s older) may common exhaust chase kitchen bathrooms might provide uniform negative pressure times. case, really see infections spread lower upper floors. someone thats vaxxed healthy portion friends either,none us believe anything posted. friends get pre-vaccine personally felt like got November 2019(was sick). distanced wore masks got tested close felt sick. frankly gotten shot, yet. Overall annoyed assumed sick (especially ones got confirmed positive cases cause know positive felt like) also sitting back watching yall call us sorts names frankly pushing us getting faster. Keep spreading false assumptions group im sure take notice listen you... Wait till deadly global viral outbreak occurs. Think something like 20-30% lethality.

Rabies 100% lethal. don‚Äôt get vaccine bitten rabid animal, RIP. exaggeration. rate children died (at least US) extremely, extremely low (&lt;0.001%). naturally immune and, get it, mostly feel like got cold flu. Guilting OP like wearing masks life death necessary. union good it‚Äôs members. used work there, it‚Äôs pretty useless union, employees aren‚Äôt involved. don‚Äôt attend meetings even read/vote new contracts come up. think union supposed simply ‚Äúdo‚Äù things without realizing collective employees real power. Seriously? Wow, obsession masks US seems even ridiculous. bad since people bother flu shot unfortunately much contagious yet still care...

I also always get flu shot. Everyone family since immunocompromised family member. many people flu think herd immunity either.

And people lazy. Annual COVID shots probably abysmal usage. know ""U"" EUA stands for?  CFR delta much lower variants.

Can explain means? Yeah fear vaccine caused real fear

Not really.

People worried ""long term side effects"" appearing years upon years upon years later, despite fact that's absolutely impossible based knowledge biology chemistry (all vaccine side effects throughout history appeared within 2 months vaccination - side effect requires physical substance cause it. Even COVID side effects - like blood clots - maximum time appear 44 days).

So no, people, there's ""real fear"" vaccine. There's pseudoscientific definition medical side effects work bunch laymen strong STEM background convinced of. Thanks explanation! really. test centers every corner free test document result. document valid short period time. enter public places it. second round vaccination finishes remains? Anti vaccines. Government interest providing many test centers free tests them. want enter certain places either pay document time simply choose vaccine timeless document (digital physical). though. socially contagious acccording Harvard study also noticed myself, periods around fat people let go more, allow become fatter felt normal ok. obviously normal. fact 4% deaths world due overweight issues. way bigger epidemic Corona. one that's getting worse evert year. Yet acceptance overweight keep rising people fight right self harm fucked Florida little capital really dumb people? Oh okay. Well, feel better know me, consider especially clever. I'm educated enough understand software developer, qualified make claims. you? Belgium PCR tests access certain events travel cost 50 55 euro I'm mistaken. 2 tests offered free (yes, know, taxes) refuse vaccine. official antigen test around 30 euro.  I‚Äôve (from Europe) didn‚Äôt go five days. Maybe that‚Äôs locals five days seems excessive theme park. 2k+2-5k still isn‚Äôt upper middle class expensive holiday. Pricey sure impossible. care transmission data. vaccines protect hospitalization transmission thats say fuck it. completed dual Doctor Science doctoral program epidemiology doctoral program nutrition Harvard University 2007.

Another Harvard grad gone crazy train... enforcement thing bullshit though. They'll send girls office spaghetti straps, hands tied comes masks? Give break. mean data Israel clearly showed this, especially elderly. One doctor. Really curious him. Boise, Idaho think it‚Äôs safe assume unvaccinated think hospitals dumb enough see signs wall allow get overwhelmed, idea tell you.

If Massachusetts hospitals dealing crisis, alarm bells would ringing like last year. alarms rung right now. Texas Florida, Alabama, many GOP led states showing trends line Texas? data line claim. think family split pretty evenly Pfizer Moderna. I‚Äôm NovaVax clinical trial. J&amp;J though.

I think one representative vaccine currently bed duty (of course anecdotal stuff). Exactly hospitals based medical need. need someone differentiate based risk taking, that's insurance companies business doing. 

Allow insurance companies collect vaccination status (and regulate treat medical exemptions vaccinated). That's free market way things. 

People allowed choose bodies long accept consequences put cost consequences everybody else. 

The unvaccinated costing us, paying insurance cover it. sure really extrapolate like single study limited sample size. statistician, feels like leap.

Your conclusion appears assume number exposures number cases vaccinated unvaccinated people. back person up, L.A. County cross-references patients CAIR database, according footnotes table list vaccinated got last weekend least 5 others event. fully vaccinated. last time anyone know tested positive last year. real gain spreading virus. People saying *well let unvaccinated get sick,* time family go ER receive care staff handle non-covid cases, wearing mask seem like minimal burden.

Is life really wrapped wearing mask public? I'd rather functioning hospital system take need it. ER couple months ago, us hallway. situation going get better. seriously nothing gain public health? joke. Whats scary teachers unvaccinated also use masks. can‚Äôt fathom it. I‚Äôm teacher. PCR 119-179$ Sweden. They‚Äôre expensive think Oh yes definitely agree, making target. deaths *accelerating* stage pandemic. problem comes vaccine reduce hospitalization death nothing transmission. Im worried myself. Im worried daughter.  going get vaccinated?  Yes diabetes overweight risk factors severe Covid disease. everyone gone diet five years ago, perhaps would slightly fewer hospitalization death Covid. everyone went diet today would measurable effect Covid. Vaccination orders magnitude effect risk reduction severe Covid anything you‚Äôre talking about. spreading misinformation. J&amp;J stabilizing protein AZ doesn‚Äôt have. hard data J&amp;J causes steady, continual increase antibody titers time lasting least 8 months. words antibody count month 8 higher month 7. month 7, it‚Äôs higher month 6, etc.

On top that, real world data shown [it‚Äôs highly effective delta.] research date links higher rate breakthrough cases hospitalizations one particular vaccine.

If CDC Changes guidelines it. right got J&amp;J vaccine indeed fully vaccinated substantial protection coronavirus. make pay full cost treatment instead! *laughs healthcare worker* first time? vaccinated people well. together. ***excerpt***

**What unanswered questions Sputnik V?**


There number outstanding issues vaccine.

Of particular importance question whether it‚Äôs associated rare blood clotting condition that‚Äôs linked AstraZeneca Johnson Johnson vaccines, also use adenovirus vectors.

Gamaleya claims reports occurring individuals given Sputnik V. Analysis following administration 2.8 million doses Sputnik V Argentina supports this. results, announced via press release Argentine health ministry, reported deaths associated vaccination showed mostly mild adverse events.

And indication association Sputnik V condition clinical trials.

However, hasn‚Äôt enough published real world data completely confident researchers would able pick condition emerge.

It‚Äôs also unclear well Sputnik performs rapidly spreading variants concern, Delta. variants partially able escape immune response generated COVID vaccines.

Research published July examined antibodies blood people vaccinated Sputnik V see performed Alpha, Beta, Gamma Delta variants. found reduction ability antibodies block infection. It‚Äôs unclear reduction would impact vaccine‚Äôs effectiveness hospitalisation death, we‚Äôre still waiting see published real world data this.

We need studies directly compare blood samples people vaccinated different vaccines Sputnik‚Äôs claims highly effective variants confirmed. We‚Äôll also need see real world analysis effectiveness variants, performed Pfizer AstraZeneca. talk bible? like austin. they‚Äôre right‚Ä¶ compared dallas, houston, SA. Austin nothing. museums, bar life weaker cities. really mainly government/college city.   Oh look, people government RIGHT THING denying spread viral outbreak!

I've never wanted live now."
