It’s like dick anything, he’s like “yeah we’re trying get sick one will” people acted like entitled go around breathing band. entirely fair comparison, non-hispanic white Americans part covid-denial political party also one likely vaxxed groups. Lumping covid deniers dilutes data. true, flip side also true. Many low income communities don’t work, wouldn’t issue. we’re talking elephants room, notice many working age adults communities magically weekdays BLM protest last summer. I’d love see vax rates protesters. isn’t black versus right democrat vs Republican issue. It’s education level issue. don’t classify Republican, I’m Deep South probably 95% people know interact personally work are. can’t count unvaccinated people know personally single hand, circle mostly affluent, college educated, professional types. Almost Republicans. 

We need stop making fucking excuses communities won’t get damn shots. Easy free access universal. Enough enough. Darwin eventually take over. Yeah, is. Missouri counts. That's true, would like links? “Third wave” first one end? dont quote this, it, survived, prob doesnt need first get vax (however still get it) afraid! afraid! Go house lock door never leave!

I read something day claimed clinic/pharmacy hood $65 shot one wealthier part town free, like first assumption haven’t really done digging it. 

But everywhere go, travel bit work, vaccines free snd available without appointment. 

I think misinformation campaign real cause facts remain poor people tend uneducated, thus leading getting vaccine. show cards. think non issue.  actually huge issue taxis town weren’t carrying insurance someone badly injured lobbied retaliation get Uber/Lyft finally allowed taxis dangerous. Classic St. Louis. awwwwww mean 'thoughts prayers' little 'god' didnt shit keep safe? 

&amp;#x200B;

mind blown. lol choice send kids…and teachers.

I’m concerned kids can’t vaccinated. teachers least choice decent level protection vaccine.  prob :) carpet world people  family member federal worker someone knowingly came work sick weeks ago started outbreak. told rumor worker could fired existing COVID policy seems like might actually try push back. LA doctors lick balls I...I appreciate youths found platform fun on. 

Not bag, good them. judgement. Yes, give liberty safety deserve neither. owe people nothing. views extremely entitled. Yeah, figure 4 also spells pretty clearly aggregate. say assuming original comment conservative white Americans vs overall black Americans, neither sources address that.

I currently sibling breakthrough case, thankfully mild. Yep. part many people forget about: even vaccine means you’re unlikely need care due covid, still face usual risks living world we’ve always faced… vaccine uptake Romania small? Thank  actually believe right decline vaccine EUA.

Every legal expert I've seen subject thus far said think refusal would supported courts company government mandates vaccination service.

What right CURRENTLY varies state federal government anything force it. believe government tied funding vaccine mandates, states would fall line.

Except Texas, Texas run window lickers.  Russia going totally collapse **cease exist?** Germany Scorpio Gemini variants gonna rough. Looking figures 3 4 appear opposite GP. Black Americans appear significantly vaccinated states vs demographics. makes sense religion based ostracizing people almost-random would good pivoting ways, too. society care productive, funds subsidize addicts. numbers back # deaths higher. say less likely vaccinated. I’m guessing lot deaths pre-vaccination-widely-available

I remember reading article stating political leaning biggest predictor whether vaccinated not. race, education socioeconomic status. Can’t find though.  We'll never get Lambda 3. Gabe Newell's laziness saved us I’m still naming variant politician encourages people wear masks.

Trump variant, DeSantis variant, MGB variant, etc. etc.  difference is, people scenario chose take job. free quit anytime free take job smoke, take job chose vaccinate

I fully support private business's right require masks every person choice whether go there

But mask mandate takes choice it. requires people something will. never get board something like that

I also add sucks people taking virus seriously hopefully people Florida realize dangerous Covid be. Dragon Con cap although they're saying is. They're expecting 50% 2019's numbers around 40,000 people. Galaxycon Raleigh last week MegaCon Orlando next weekend. question great one answer complicated. Typically cancer survivors good blood counts considered immunocompromised. stays complicated there. Blood cancer survivors, like lymphoma, worse outcomes disease. studies still trying find why. consider less high risk getting high risk dying it. add lung issues. lung fibrosis bleomycin lymphoma treatments. doctors said could put higher risk getting higher risk dying, emphasis could. finally comes vaccination issue. People blood cancers less chance producing antibodies vaccination general population. right it’s also looking like we’re retaining long. I’m study exact topic. expect members study invited booster study nothing promised. I’m antibody t-cell portions study. 

At time, don’t seek boosters general guidance I’ve seen far offered, we’re going wanting get them. living we’re healthy people vaccine instead double/n95 masking household members behaving aren’t vaccinated me, husband never dropped mask protect me. Also, dad known exposure positive person, likely meets new guidance receiving convalescent plasma treatments even positive test. It’s treatment shown work especially improve outcomes blood cancer survivors make sure everyone care team knows this. I’m 16 year lymphoma survivor NCCS advocate I’m medical professional. attend programs put doctors help encourage people talk doctors also know doctors behind times since focused protecting active treatment.

That's one example. kinds people pensioners office workers holiday Manchester. consider rational smart people already got think that's fairly reasonable? 

Maybe guess  Wish US  Look Figure 3 link shows % vaccinated race per state. surrounding areas trump loving antivax antimask freaks lol. Yeehaw reasonable people realize become endemic. California online system verify really got it. fake card online version it’s provided state. verifying everyone. card make sure matches online. easy pull Less white conservatives long shot.

This false. might true early pandemic, data month ago, [Blacks ahead last month, blacks hispanics outpacing whites terms % vaccinated per day. racial gap disappearing least bit surprised whites last racial category (with conservative whites even lower) get full approval CDC wave mandates businesses, etc. Right move. Still would need bunch corrupt vax technicians makes much much difficult forge piece paper. system 100% secure, it’s major improvement compared paper cards. afraid doesn’t mean shouldn’t take seriously. could still get covid one wants sick. point live life take reasonable precautions can. I'm also Brevard county, though work hospital, teach health sciences college though. Thanks hard work.

 several past grads friends colleagues work various hospitals facilities county nuts. can't stand many folks around still acting like pandemic happening/serious. 

I hate governor. Like, unaware vaccines already required healthcare workers? Like flu hep b mmr varicella? (With exemptions solid reasons course).

 hate clueless folks try act like know wtf actually going on. Ugh ties rigorous studies put protection infection 60 - 80% completely wrong No. addressing travel started dystopian fantasy you’re fighting system selling diapers someone doesn’t imaginary ID card, that’s gets roll it. rule Diaper Games.  mentioning github, read pretty obvious actually trying make accurate.

Masks vaccines go together concord. One prevents spread prevents infection.  makes people feel like it’s “post apocalypse” even it’s literally that’s depressing. wonder DeSantis’ t-shirt sales doing?

It’s easy far cry shortages experienced months ago argument would valid. There’s also $100 recently instated bonus getting shot fantastic incentives low income individuals. “The fear misinterpreted numbers cause vaccination rates go down” says Seattle Times put misinterpreted statistic goddamn headline.

As vaccination rates go up, cases breakthrough. isn’t news anyone three functioning brain cells. least tried spread word, guess. I'm starting feel sorry anti-vaxxors - really stupidity point lack education majority cases ultimately ignorance could kill them. know nothing person died particular certainly case majority people remaining vaccinated. lied manipulated. Multiple doctors office really encouraged it. office also works closely university known medical programs. think trust makes sense, faith vaccines work.  wish completely wrong reopening read anything would give hope unvaccinated. need vaccinations, including kids.

The school friend works seems going motions. think interested getting funding. classes size before. kids, heard, free mingle classes. know last year segregation proposed help isolate outbreaks apparently happening. Bad bot.    come straight school daycare side visit friends Canada.  Awards best pizza? Eh. disagree. hear, people getting paid like crap treated like crap want return, especially deal vile anti-maskers. Else pretty much everyone else I've talked want get back work, want level work-life balance. They've working whole bunch home used to, seem burnt out. 

I'm boat, like face time team, current state affairs 30% population sabotaging recovery causing surges every months. Safety First. I'd rather team focus work, worry getting vaccine ineligible / immunocompromised family members infected.  Kids arent unvaccinated choice tho &lt;rubs hands together licks there's least one major manufacturer using serum kids adults, make huge difference.

Unless mutates complete vaccine disregard. Then... Well fuck.  I'm 38/m north Texas currently quarantine home delta variant breakthrough infection. vaccinated May/June moderna. still wore masks anytime public seem help, still got infected people want vaccinate thus breed new mutations.. bloody hell.. think we'll ever get   false assumption held incorrectly many people “Trump voters ones getting vaxxed”.. fact highest percentage non vaccinated populations compared total populations Black Hispanic groups. White Asian race groups rates expected. maximum gap doses 12 weeks? Perhaps title changed ""People 65, got single dose March restart regimen Monday""? true 50 crowd fear dismissing danger younger people contributed stupidity we're seeing anit-vaxx crowd. Everyone get vaccinated needs get vaccine. Even 1% younger people get sick die way know 99% 1%. Imagine game Russian roulette 1/6 chance death, 4/6 chance flesh wound, fun times Breakthrough leading hospitalization around 1 25,000 certainly rare enough use word, go off. return normalcy hospitals able elective surgery pretty big win. Florida winning exactly? feel sorry mods thread; fingers get blisters deleting celebrations.

The sad thing like 30-40% _entire world's population_ anti-vaxx. easily fixable problem.  Los Angeles we're known restrictions, clubs open far know. hear loud music buildings going home work. city thinking requiring proof vaccination things like restaurants clubs nothing's final. Private businesses require want know many would bother unless to. thing mask mandate. Yea free legally required stuff save popular opinion.  many ended hospital (That vacinated)?

Some great studies, well current research available topic presented thread. valuable. means, go whatever last 24 hour direct care center tells you.

No, don't. Anyone go get tested time. Masks **not** punishment.

They’ve done part past year want back what? exposed onslaught purposely unvaccinated COVID patients? overwork bunch hostile people zero appreciation? anyone experience rapid result tests coming back negative Delta, symptoms?

 Last Saturday, family car broke family get ride back home. husband called MIL agreed pick us up. antivaxx believe covid husband confirmed sick going anywhere. lied. Two days later husband called check coughing uncontrollably, difficulty breathing, food tastes weird, etc. words ""no fever, I'm sure I'm fine"". progressively gotten worse. daughter, husband, started showing symptoms Wednesday (husband vaccinated, daughter young) rapid test Friday. came back negative. symptoms varying three us. Daughter low fever headache better now, husband coughing, I'm coughing, headache, low fever, chest tightness, fatigue. quarantined case, really feel like result wrong.

Since 2 week schedule legal requirement? recently, company store level workweeks start Saturday end sunday. Employees got schedules next week Tuesday before. Hours kept 35 costs shifts would shortened instead extra days off. We'd rarely 2 consecutive days (grocery store) [Fucking China  mean don’t see it? see people saying vaccines “don’t prevent infections much”. agree vaccines perfect act like don’t prevent majority infections misinformation. know that, don’t get wrong, others definitely are.   I'm starting erasmus next month Finland. course, I'm fully vaccinated (got 2nd Pfizer shot 2 days ago). hope things normal enough enjoy experience!  “How let socialism take poor church?” - Floridian, probably. Oh jeez guess delta getting crazy we're take figures face value, vaccine currently 60% effective. Someone correct math I'm wrong. I'm thinking 100% effective, breakthrough cases would 0% cases. vaccine effect, breakthrough cases would 50% cases. 20% cases would translate 40% ineffective, thus 60% effectiveness.

The vaccines intital studies around 90% effective, correct? picture seems deteriorating. Speaking breakthrough cases, seventeen year old son found mother I've friends tested positive. entire family vaccinated. rest getting tested today. thought too. state leadership needs step first. Running slander job cheap political points… causing hundreds deaths months economic devastation.

Worth it! like sure like Spanish flu Ebola terms lethality. think scenario may take longer happen, like years. meantime science rest vaccines updates. Andromeda Strain many vaccinated people died Covid? many even infected outdoors? Lol long would take feel comfortable effects mRNA? 

What reasoning taking j&amp;j? mRNA, pfizer, forced anyone.


 making feel forced? havebt gotten yet sounds like whatever feel forcing isnt currently forcing you, worried forced future somehow? get non-mrna vaccine crybaby bad Abbott won’t step protect Texans virus I'll grab 🍿  I've seen. double moderna/pfizer vaccination best bet atm.

We want scenario covid endemic kept removing protective measures actually achieved elimination. Tuesday, average 192 children Covid-19 admitted US hospitals every day past week, CDC data shows.

Here's state's experience, pretty tried keep class instruction much anyone thinks it'll easy okay. be. drink bleach put UV light butt though? I've heard good things. Province Town study “confirm” anything issues author even admitted to. one bear week (a sex orgy basically) two: 

The findings report subject least four limitations. First, data report insufficient draw conclusions effectiveness COVID-19 vaccines SARS-CoV-2, including Delta variant, outbreak. population-level vaccination coverage increases, vaccinated persons likely represent larger proportion COVID-19 cases. Second, asymptomatic breakthrough infections might underrepresented detection bias. Third, demographics cases likely reflect attendees public gatherings, events marketed adult male participants; study underway identify population characteristics among cases, additional demographic characteristics underlying health conditions including immunocompromising conditions.*** DPH, CDC, affected jurisdictions collaborating response; DPH conducting additional case investigations, obtaining samples genomic sequencing, linking case information laboratory data vaccination history. Finally, Ct values obtained SARS-CoV-2 qualitative RT-PCR diagnostic tests might provide crude correlation amount virus present sample also affected factors viral load.††† Although assay used investigation validated provide quantitative results, significant difference Ct values samples collected breakthrough cases cases. might mean viral load vaccinated unvaccinated persons infected SARS-CoV-2 also similar. However, microbiological studies required confirm Province Towns study author said issues. Also even study CDC still said vaccines 75-85 percent effective stopping White House agrees vaccines prevent infection well reportedly frustrated media making seem like Unfortunately, cases, outreach efforts might occurred late. New York Times, instance, tweeted early Friday morning, ""The Delta variant contagious chickenpox may spread vaccinated people easily unvaccinated, internal C.D.C. report said."" Ben Wakana, member White House's rapid response team, responded bluntly: ""VACCINATED PEOPLE TRANSMIT VIRUS RATE UNVACCINATED PEOPLE FAIL INCLUDE CONTEXT WRONG."" Times ultimately added context tweet Chicken pox measles universal diseases, means pretty much everyone (who isn’t vaccinated) eventually gets them. Usually children. 

COVID equal chicken pox qualifies universal disease. Applying advanced logic, implies pretty much every child catch it. 

Reflect that: 100m children COVID. doubt vast majority won’t get even get sick, small proportion die. may lot children. 

Worse, don’t know long COVID affect children. Maybe 5 years we’ll faced devastating neurological disease across whole generation. Probably likely - it’s possible. many unknowns. 

What gamble we’re taking. they’re punishing majority people vaccinated minority chose to? Governors higher kill count serial killers [something similar Czechia](http://www.covdata.cz). looks better IMO even information Europe! even compare countries clicking map. also Czech though, sadly. I’m comment don’t like *was  [Here wanted add caption actual video posts title resisted -
**Unvaccinated man FL fights life ICU ventilator** feel like depends location. supermarket, almost everyone wearing mask, example went bike shop weeks ago, closer like 50-60%. it’s late. I’m sure, though, thread know ignorant people sadly still delusion “naturally” safe “nothing” virus. person knew finally reality hit changed tunes. Even feels futile, hopefully others get similar, ignorant people worst happens. vaccines are. general rule line continues change time, lines lockdowns failing things fully properly prevented goals originate had, shifted goals. wish pretend never initial goals elimination. 

For herd immunity effective vaccines need prevent cases well serious outcomes. vaccines provide immunity mutations occur render vaccines less effective. huge portion unvaccinated people, vaccine provide strong immunity, that's serious problem.

You're correct initial worst vaccines would allowed used provided 50-60% overall immunity. never hope, bare minimum bar qualify. However, variants seen studies showing 30-50% immunity. something concerned about.

It mean vaccines bad, arent. Everyone needs get vaccinated get worse. cannot lie give false sense over-security. one point would setting goal scenario 20% cases breakthrough cases. bad. shows virus getting worse shows place remove protective measures meant limit spread. 

And, drive point home, said wearing masks others right? That's said start. Well, 30-50% immune virus that's huge chance spreader virus vigilant keep mind vaccines perfect virus changing quickly due series unfortunate conditions. ECMO machines rare everywhere. many covid patients ECMO lived?

To honest would rather give accident victim unvaccinated covid patient. ""Breakthrough"" also positive connotations. 

As in: ""Wow! I've working 5 months incredible breakthrough!"" 

Or: ""Kevin cried first time sex. think important breakthrough relationship."" please elaborate Fair, yet post implies things common. people really think things going cancel en masse mistaken. reason stopped virus specifically, restrictions prevented happening. Restrictions come back play again. likely go hospitals doctors better healthcare. always saved apocalypse level things would actually end human civilization, mentally. This. ""but variants"" argument damn bad argument vaccines, overused. Stop fucking saying it. could vaccinate 100.00% adult population hit zero daily cases continental United States would make almost difference risk worse variants developing. unvaccinated perpetuated disease country months now.

So, extent, does. WHO's strategy, vaccine wasted, current reality, millions vaccines wasted.

I think pretty clear COVAX strategy would people vaccinated now. would concerned Florida Texas Missouri Arkansas, states hospitals can’t keep up.  Fear real virus. Fear real *vaccine*. Show us data then? CDC lying?  Ill take source that, im sure little bit complex old bed... He's already lost 40,000. margin victory less that. Lol hostile!  covid ever go away, matter drastic lockdowns are.  worked contact tracer last year. 

Basically, one answers phone. 

Contact tracing near impossible. *Especially* group people think Covid hoax government shouldn’t exist, much less phoning them. Lmao Health experts one Mississippi’s largest hospitals warning healthcare system rapidly approaching breaking point hospitalizations continue increase along rise Delta variant. 94 COVID-19 patients, University Mississippi Medical Center currently over-capacity healthcare system fights staff shortages. health system, health system—I think safely say health systems around us city state—is breaking point. finite resources. break, close…and think we’re rapidly heading direction,” Dr. Alan Jones, associate vice chancellor clinical affairs said. loss staff throughout course pandemic outbreaks within system, Dr. Jones told reporters Wednesday afternoon units hospital empty cannot staff them.

Omitting withholding accurate realistic scientific information order get people comply behave certain way kind conspiracy idea that's anti vaxxers love. That's great analogy! much typed, said basically nothing. Good work.   Thanks. boosters might better strategy ? data-set insufficient. making incorrect, assumptive correlations. End story.   Strangely enough no, US Government charged responsibility. 

The question there's war on. vaccinated played part eagerly ready help fight. Even though *less* improve situation, *some* gladly will. force sit bench watch, let can?

Obviously would side ""in crisis decline help matter small."" that's good info feel like Delta new seems worse I'm sure first link still applicable. understand stuff I'm hearing anecdotal though.

We'll seeing least one person who's vaccinated, possibly two (but they'll masked up). worry even folks who've vaccinated spread degree now, fact we'll need bring baby airplane (and therefore airport) he'll surrounded ton folks might spread it.

This feels like we're back start pandemic there's new thing (Delta) we're learning day goes on. Masks going save children covid, vaccines, maybe, masks South aren't. Hospitals beds staff treat heart attacks, car accidents, etc. 11 month old girl Covid flown helicopter 150 miles find facility room, Houston medical - largest medical complex Earth, space patients. He's gone all-in gamble COVID would go away could claim hoax. vaccine doesn’t help “those assholes” transmit virus less. “Those assholes” going forced staffing collapse right. Say goodbye standard care healthcare workers tired called “assholes” hero year ago course everyone get vaccinated..... headline cheating little.

As article states down, 600 deaths April 1.

Since vaccination rate third, would honest compare 600/2 non-vax deaths 26 vax deaths.

So vaccines perfect, **are 11.4 times better** (600 / 2\*26) vaccinated.

(of course vaccine rolled time older patients got first rough estimate. next month going interesting good way.) would hopefully steer people direction home schooling seeing public schools nothing scams teach next life skills. expect them, winter? listened work yesterday morning… surrounded unvaccinated. Get head checked, mate. likely tax poor. Pretty sure we're widespread Delta hospitalization right US, I'm quite sure point is.

We're uptick States, number vaccinated hcws coming COVID worrisome. little early go ""wrong"" we're b Sturgis, summer concert does, kids back school yet.

Including I’m from...in Ohio. 🤦‍♂️  Extra unemployment benefit first week September. week we’ll probably get Pfizer approval. approved like vaccines though say education. said understanding.

You say grandma fed kids healthy diet. Maybe that's time grandma kids, processed foods really exist, sugar expensive, food-industrial complex barely infancy, simple diets meat vegetables actually affordable?

Fruit Juice actually terrible you. sugar water. may contain traces vitamins minerals without fat, fiber, protein actual food, cause insulin spike bloodstream like drinking regular coke will. people know this, though, I'll tell why: lobbying. food pyramid learned school (and may well) based neutral sources, based research conducted biased industry sources. sugar lobby *huge* we're coming realize many decades bad public health policy influenced lobbying. (e.g. heart disease caused excess *sugar* intake, excess fat/cholesterol intake)

And sort gets root problem: Information. carry pocket device allows access entire limitless wealth human knowledge expertise. know source information trust, though? doctor listen diet: one says meat bad, one says meat good? know right? people trust one, people trust another, regardless source trust **will** find information support position.

Almost every single kid vaccinated building. could normal school year, something rising Juniors never had. people won’t get vaccinated we’re back masks likely large school evens. Yep, JUNIORS normal school year. sucks. I’m 3rd year teaching haven’t normal school year yet.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* they’re people, right? Understand done like 80 percent vaccinated 

Then mandates

Expecting everyone comply seems strange

If people goal. work like bacterial resistance, viruses need hosts replicate. Vaccinated people (normally) quickly eliminate virus systems.

Mutation happens randomly, numbers game ""how many covid viruses there""? viruses means chances randomly mutate, chances mutate way makes contagious, deadly, evasive (regarding vaccines).

The WHOs strategy long-term efficacy current vaccines widely understood yet, best strategy bring total number cases worldwide vaccinating many people possible. reduces rate mutations rate beneficial mutations much greater rate booster unknown efficacy. Masks aren’t required Anaheim, hospitalizations deaths almost nonexistent right now. Disneyland requires masks. I’d say Disneyland safer Disneyworld moment Covid wise. Faking vaccine card contracting dying covid biggest self-own world. get jab Yes odds lower delta variant much contagious we’ve already seen examples vaccinated, outdoor events causing infection can’t really argue spread isn’t going happen events like anymore even vaccinated individuals, argue “it’s worth it” you. says variants showing resistant current vaccines caused it.

That’s going happen either way vaxxed persons immune system kill virus faster gives less time mutate even idea die spreads.

Contrast unvaxed person doesn’t strong immune response, virus lives longer body, chances mutate, increases odds spreads another person. Vaxed unvaxed potential cause variant it’s 100 times likely unvaxed person. I’m still wearing masks public eating there’s enough space practice level physical distancing. 

I need find work soon I’m probably gonna start cutting back outings know I’m gonna start passing Covid tests regularly. 

I don’t want risk losing 10-14 days pay let guard got somehow. sinovac. got chance get Astra, took it. identify test new varients? NY State health care provider administering vaccines, they're ones access database. basically NYS resident Excelsior Pass work.

If coming state, need bring CDC card, least photo it.

Take look [the NYC proof vaccine assuming coming NYC. going elsewhere, look local rules. rules still worked out, though. mind ease recommended Even Darth Vader masked up. Darth Vader it, you. I've got ticket see Tame Impala live concert month now. odds actually happen? really sad come people. 

We need education reform instruction critical thinking. I’ve heard people get shots Pfizer, also get shots Moderna. safe? good idea? think 95+% drive behavior. Thanks mansplaining vaccine does! would idea otherwise!

Is 26% majority? weekend-dip. Usually dips 10% weekend. Good, need people like you. I'm neighborhood everyone take seriously I'm biding time shit hits fan (and half people boomers). northeast disgusting know bunch people vaccinated. One reason go outside talk neighbors anymore except one retired nurse. violated every order governor gave last year. I'm 100% cool that. holding breath kids point.  Huh? unvaccinated people admitted?

Well would still show negative ""hundreds"" unvaccinated people waited line thousands people slowly worked way front, finally turned away?

They checked papers gate Michigan ave. Huge lines really form there, gets backed farther security checks. bit confused. grown azz adults? really need official order either state, fed, cdc actually wear mask? Seriously, need one take dump?

Just man-up, mask-up, wash-up...you need mommy tell that....

Seriously folks, wake up!!! would shame families….held church accountable. least US, conversation government immunocompromised individuals (cancer, organ transplant, autoimmune, etc) likely failed seroconvert 2 doses much better chances 3. That's small portion overall population. There's conversation elderly (65+) potentially needing well.

I seen argument general population needs booster shots aka Feds paid it. got mutations getting even meaner things here:

1) I’m saying 100% vaccination required, we’re hovering around 50%, that’s low. one assuming would 100% vaccination - don’t need complete vaccination help stave virus spread, need high enough levels virus won’t find sufficiently sized susceptible population within grow/evolve.

2) much done development standpoint ensure future immunity currently unknown variants. often done (and case here) target regions virus expected critical least capable heavily altered without compromising ability virus propagate. foolproof still intended function background actually getting high amounts population vaccinated. So, basically, select portion expected hardest mutate escape significantly cut population susceptible people give virus much less time/ability foster new variants. supposed go hand hand. agree, I've taken college level critical thinking classes, let tell you...when teacher actually understand critical thinking...those classes teach anyone actually needs skill. Depends mean pandemic guess? Bullshit. never talent band. flu chickenpox foot/mouth disease rates ""normal"" year I'm fairly certain adults state would show far concern. fact brush unconscionable. areas starting giving second doses Pfizer/Moderna people received J&amp;J.

J&amp;J similar AZ; research study found AZ followed Pfizer Moderna produces better immunity metrics either 2*AZ 2*mRNA.  One would assume similar studies published J&amp;J+mRNA combos..  friend tragedy *freedom* made choice. Vaccinate people! Bill Gates give shit go world round.....well exactly round flat vaccines work.
If phone *they* already know find *they* want. Yeah ... height stupidity recklessness. get people. Maybe zoom services ... maybe venture crowded spaces unvaccinated. shitbaggery uniquely American.  deaths stopped doubling UK. Hopefully August 7th peak wait see. tied 1st place. /s can’t stop it. He’s like Trump, failed wanna dictator. They’re based town Pacific, 45 minutes southwest St. Louis. Lots anti-vax idiots area.  would bad news - we've society operating idea food-borne transmission basically happen. Last Thursday (Aug 5), bare void deck Block 132 Lorong Ah Soo transformed hour mobile vaccination site. next day, ready administer vaccine doses mobile vaccination team stationed Sunday, returning weeks later administer second Medical Group's Dr Ng said: ""It lot easier (seniors) able come (homes) place provide vaccination vicinity. ""And members public walk past, bandwidth address concerns.""

This sounds like really good approach, pop-up vaccination sites serve local neighborhood, return later administer second shots. Makes good use vaccination personnel, makes easy local residents. Staying spot days great idea, providing time word spread locally.

Clever imaginative. stupid lot reasons. First deaths vaccinated people. It’s rare, rarer dying COVID without vax, happen.

We’re taking death. end (or loved ones) life. You’ll never see again.  Choosing roll dice readily available, free, safe solution reckless everyone around you.

Second much likely still pass bug onto vaxed person don’t die still get sick. don’t want get sick, sucks.

A vaccine isn’t bullet proof shield prevents harm. It’s one many protections take minimize spread sake EVERYONE. Either know you’re intellectually dishonest you’re ignorant work stop talking things don’t know anything about.

And finally, people CANT get vaxed legitimate medical reasons. Antivaxers putting people danger.

Eventually, people always going stop caring, sake mental health. nonsense infuriates me. expected vitus calm many people got vaccinated, apparently worse ever? How?

Supposedly Delta contagious. recently read Delta produces 1000x viral particles nose throat patients original covid. infects far people. 

Having said that, I'm confused too. 

The CDC said real infection rate 3-4 times official rate. may 35 million positive infections done via tests, probably closer 120 million Americans already covid (that figure pre delta variant). top 70% Americans age 12 least one shot. Something like almost 170 Americans fully vaccinated. 

Theres obviously overlap two groups, still I'd assume maybe (as guess) 250 million Americans either fully vaccinated virus (if assume 1/3 people got vaccinated already covid). leave lot people get disease. confusing too. 

I know vaccinated people get Delta, think infection rate 3x lower vs unvaccinated. We've learned last year social safety net available catch people would work making significantly less imposing restrictions- there's obviously side protecting ""profits"" gov't ability support us need lock again. definitely eye-opening much government fails us.

Beyond that, vaccines available Americans aged 12+, true (partial non-ubiquitous) lockdowns past.

The *only* way see new lockdowns happening variant emerges least contagious deadly Delta, also escapes vaccines plus available boosters.

Chances zero, moment they're pretty darn low. decide need get vaccine selfish POS drunk driver look start restricting basic access employment vacation status? Eric Feigl Ding 1) infectious disease epidemiologist (he nutrition)! 2) insanely alarmist everything entire pandemic. seriously thinks farting spreads covid. Thank much ❤️  I’m fine it, least figure decent vaccine common cold  Explain  1. Mink get respiratory viruses humans do, even used model animal infections treatment.

2. Mink eat bats, e.g. bats fall ceiling cave dying coronavirus infection. origin SARS virus, evidenced several years SARS epidemic

3. fur industry breeds mink millions. large, globally connected population mink allows respiratory viruses spread mutate. Viruses jump captive wild animals.

4. Urban sprawl reduces habitat ensures frequent encounters humans animals.

So blame COVID probably go people eating bats, people living sprawling suburbs consumers industrial livestock, case especially wear fur clothes. It’s bit lazy blame use masks. real issue many people aren’t vaccinated bad policy like leaving places open large numbers people gather. places Europe people don’t wear masks, capacity restaurants remains limited, nightclubs closed, festivals banned - basically risk groups vaccinated. Masks certainly help, solution. Typically mandates exceptions, like allergies vaccine components, prior adverse reactions.

The goal get every man, woman, child vaccinated, get like 95%+ vaccinated.  many many breakthrough cases. vaccine stop virus moment spreading help way less problem Covid-19 itself. sorry country, plethora morons every single country around world. luxury problem country Europa etc., world a.k.a. third world proper medical support vaccines.  discriminate someone literally anything. you’re referring illegal discrimination, sense - you’re right. However, lots people legally discriminate. don’t like socialize anti vaxxers. That’s discrimination they’re protected class. 

Anyway, definitely interesting. Claiming “illegal discrimination” anti vaxxers like claiming illegal discrimination Backstreet Boys fans lol.

Maybe people went liberal brainwashing camps call schools would know work numbers real world values, that's like opinion, man. Immunity lasts ~6 months, especially severe outcomes + highly infectious virus requires vaccines we’ll able administer + reduction transmission infected. Yeah, it’s nightmare scenario, ones could reasonably predicted worst. Nah new n vaccinated staying home soon won’t allowed anywhere. scared shot? get stay home now.  actually. know you’re bad one. yea 2019 one got infected...

This truly shocking! tragic loss life. really possible think breaktrough cases vaccinated people also got infect people. 

Even science paper stated vaccine : effect strains mutate eridicate host (virus) weakens it/ergo better time it. like vaccination measles = one shot measles.

Because this, harder strains appear jab kill virus. Report devs here: make account go Issues, see someone else reported first (in case add comment issue), create not.

I'm watching Malta moment... they've vaccinated almost 90 percent population, cases dropping. bounce back would seem wide transmission never going stop. Might covid end like flu, then? Unavoidable widespread cases? 
 
Not it'd end world obviously vaccines good job preventing serious illness, healthcare systems overwhelmed new case waves highly vaccinated countries. I'm curious actual herd immunity even possible honest.

Also likely 0nly advise stick mrna prior 2 were.   everyone heading Disney World Florida 100% open. wonder bad could come this... majority breakthroughs sniffles.

Actually, least (and probably significantly than) 26% breakthroughs asymptomatic -- so, less sniffles.

We’re going run Greek alphabet pretty quickly. need start naming variants like hurricanes. List names work them.

🥴🥴🥴 But, wrItEs (sic)! F UdonT lEt In, U gOAnnA fridge mysE lIbArtEE! I’m fine course fox line ridiculous. 

But I’m getting worldometer Mexico has, per million people, confirmed cases 20% US, tests done 4% US, deaths roughly equal US. 

With numbers they’re definitely confirming many cases exist. Medical care might worse median age ten years younger US. two may balance enough say death rate Mexico probably provides accurate estimate Covid’s prevalence number confirmed cases. Sure it’s homegrown…by Nanogen Pharmaceutical Biotechnology JSC several different vaccine types, differs bit, really ""getting COVID"" all. vaccines exposing spike protein (the part sticks sphere ever see artist representation Coronavirus) whole virus itself. spike protein cannot reproduce really anything harm you. body know though sees threat ramps immune response learn destroy prime body case ever sees again. vaccines (mostly Chinese origin, also one India) actually grow full virus, 'kill' include injection, actually result getting infected either. 

No matter what, COVID vaccine result infected contagious. sucks. Poor guy. Blah blah blah put pile recycled crap knew going happen knew going said pink cabs show outside door, lock wait whoever got go away. think tigers banned general public? guess faith problematic demographic conservatives. best make Florida uninhabitable it’s working.   death? vaccine makes cells produce harmless protein covid-19. may side effects body builds antibodies covid-19 protein. infecting you. suggest read FAQ CDC website go depth. idea FDA approval works, you?

Normally, test virus 10 studies must show safe selected standard participants (basically, less people die/get sick before). pay ~1million review. Failing study means back drawing board try later. need pass 10 studies get FDA approval.

To emergency authorization, TEN TIME. 10million table, lose one studies fails. must still pass TEN get emergency approval. still number cases studied, number people side effects studied... fucking same.

That is, ALREADY fucking oversight accountability vaccine currently fully approved. semantic bureaucracy say approved, showing complete ignorance subject bared world. difference seriously pure pedantry technicality. Vaccinate people! I'm old smallpox vaccine scars arm prove it. little vaccine available live minute everyone lines up. son US lost best friend yesterday, 36 year old antivaxxer Covid.

Needless say went mental him, anti vax complacent. went next day fully vaccinated, 14 people got Covid first funeral family still believe Vaccine hope hold second one.
Don't selfish, Vaccinate! Literally last thing we'd want military get crippled *preventable* illness. Tetanus usually every 10 years anyway.

Fun fact - studies Tetanus went 5 years. We're pretty sure protection lasts *FOURTY* years, one's done comprehensive study cheaper research (and also profitable doses used) keep giving vaccine every 5. Thanks link. Fascinating  saw. Thanks!

Although might ethical moral thing species, national governments created seek better human species overall. exist sake people specific nation. Therefore predict fall deaf ears. NYC app, state already one? That's actual study, summary paper given mechanism, without providing links anything showing consensus vaccine's protection greater prior exposure.

I'm saying n95 scarcity over, arguments regarding efficacy cloth makes pointless. people still idea, continue use (as well vilify people using) cloth masks. rational person, frustrating. doesn’t actual reason. made mind without reason can’t change reason No, end either enough people develop enough immunity becomes endemic pandemic, like flu, enough people made immune simultaneously gets totally eradicated, like smallpox...

The point is, even vaccinated, better cavalier risk getting infected. single case probably big deal, _everyone_ population takes many risks, increases chances things get worse.

Seems like church cared beginning. Darwinism work. Nah, keep waiting cos dont explain decision you. Every business policy long 14 day quarantine rules necessary. Sioux tribes state embraced vaccines, started elders communities save language cultural history spread there. lovely Governor refused mandate masks close towns counties COVID hotspots tribes closed roads reservations started check points. refused allow people passage live reservations set temperature checks. Kristi's, Governor, response threaten sue tribes....for trying save people.

This stopped hot spots popping reservations. One projects stops every three weeks new person popped COVID positive.

The tribes wanted halt spread COVID people Kristi give damn sucked deeply Trump's ""COVID false"" well. flying Florida pandemic Florida hot spot nation. woman going run reelection 2022 President 2024. Please vote COVID denying twit.

Kristi also one okayed ""Meth. We're it."" campaign. Delta thanks problem corona deadly enough scare antivaxxers. underestimate risk, agree huge even Delta. deadly original SARS they'd cutting line get shot.  hear huge sample pool fat never helped anything except jiggle/reverb crying sleep self soothing. Thanks reminding Florida state southern US never stepped foot in. really see reason to, you’re entertaining way California are! take one factor consideration.

I already made mind up. Keep mind said original reply decision period. controversial? Yeah are. Even though fair share antivax sentiment, least whole vaccine/no vaccine thing political (yet). Let's get almost everyone vaccinated happens. Thank advice. Sound like good first step. doctor two years. might make appointment see maybe tell best hospital go to. told higher percent chance vaccinated people becoming infected thought. First 97% protected, delta 93% data saying 80% least recognize tallied two comments completely ignore points put move goalposts? 

You refused answer how, based messages behavior, political party would greatly changed fortunes US. get increasingly vague, asking (rhetorically) 'done better' overall, post top states death rates, move talking republicans masks/vaccinations. single republican position things, asked, evidence action results things would different different president? ""Email"" wall. Bs fear bunch bills keeps poor blacks doctors offices. Let folks get sick going hospital Nice rebuttle, shines light intelligence level.

""Yeah, well, dumb!!"" LMAO child wrong, something tells Sturgis demographic part vaccinated majority. don’t kids, feel like parents know school open. Virtual schooling didn’t seem work many kids everything I’ve heard past year 

And I’m northeast people took Covid pretty seriously first thought well. Cases already climbing…. course lagging, vaccines available here. almost vaccines requirement vaccinating people. I'm literally surrounded hundred different opinions it. recommend TikTok, hundreds thousands average Americans/people across globe speak freely (also proving they're bot paid content creators, proven exist) true personal opinions sides. Also, actually ask neighbors/friends/schoolmates. mean literally them. 

I think realize Reddit hates TikTok much 😂 I'm doctor feel 100% comfortable saying doctor giving goal think realistically hit, ideal weight. average height 5'9"", around 150-160 lbs wiggle room either side. need take word it, absolute ton information online. actually ask doctor next time go too. ""hey, I've made lot progress since last here. ideal bodyweight me?"" guarantee they're going say 200 200. 25 lbs muscle also extremely large amount muscle gain, would take multiple years strength training, ever put kind lean muscle weight long distance cardio. 

Look, I'm trying minimize progress, I'm happy working way fitness goals. Maybe original post could gentler tone. want making decisions based best information possible? rocking 26 BMI 200 lbs think ideal got lot muscle mass long-distance cycling, operating lot bad assumptions catch eventually. decide based good information good enough you, that's totally fine. want make informed decision? mean? mean sterile covid germs? Surface transmission really thing. one looking forward buying one many cheap pre owned bikes market month two now. Good pastor there, one running Florida could pull head out, maybe CDC see Florida possibly ground zero new, dangerous Covid strain outbreak.

No joke, Texas Florida watched CDC, former seen place next enhanced Delta variant likely originate. You’re idiot. I’m Durham. Haven’t come across single person complaining wearing mask entire pandemic. mask mandate removed rarely saw people stores without one. Durham little bit bubble North Carolina. Jingoism funny. great deal know breakthrough cases. vaccinated, could early vaccine adopters dealing diminished protection? vaccine get? Could one vaccines increased rates breakthrough cases? Yes outcomes breakthrough cases tend better, data may end proving 3rd booster necessary. data likely breakthrough case spread others? Thanks. think correct year election ton debate this. said know VA NJ talking lot mail voting Governor races. I’ll call Biden Monday get sorted 😊 else anybody say obvious? Yup, he's clearly trying CYA avoid lawsuits. Step one, pretend always vaccine. Step two, circulate claim one infected church jesus, case closed. Step three, enjoy congregation think blame has/will befall them. mixed messaging CDC media isn’t helping. one hand, “vaccinated individuals spread Covid easily unvaccinated ones” (the weasel word “can”) hand “get vaccinated protect community”. Cool story, tell us long term side effects every last chemical product body ingested entire life. Come on, we're waiting. caught H2N3 (or H3N2) years ago.

That's flu correct?

And symptoms that?  Unfortunately standards apply politicians  parents fault? Can’t vaccinated people still spread covid? assuming parents weren’t vaccinated? Yes, it’s exactly go know it’s stupid put that. Funny thing never feared vaccines before. sick time constantly make sure shots date. Never gave much thought before. It’s probably due side effect medicines. high blood medications years one day could fill due pulled market found contained cancer causing agent. yes say could anything. put trust medicine helps get better sicker. What’s sucks even person get cancer taking medicine would probably never correlated medicine, truthfully nobody would know unless causes specific type cancer. guess fear medicine comes from. finding medicine don’t take nothing blood pressure. Stupid know, fear strong. know bite long run. Please know I’m really thinking I’m scared. unvaxxed people aren’t wearing masks unconcerned covid, likely exposed covid either got sick asymptomatic. It’s like year half. Doesn’t mean they’re “immune”, viruses mutate quickly. That’s there’s different flu vaccine every year. district left Florida - mandating masks teachers students opt note parents. Good luck. I'm sorry happened. Yeah, problem vaccination stop spread delta. stops serious infections.

A good proven way stop infections masks.

It’s really simple. Bull City guy here. Mayor top things start also Vaccine Pandemic research facilities Duke campus. adjacent Orange County (home UNC-Chapel Hill) really worked hard keep residents safe. vaccine manufacturers recommending boosters, even Pfizer. Make will. Wut? responding comment, obviously fucking incorrect. course, silly me.  local hospital systems seem that, perhaps take look area see. mine running 95% unvaccinated hospital clear, indication sort vaccine failure. Quite cases expected. State data still suggests unvaccinated people nearly five times likely infected inoculated. almost hospitalizations deaths among unvaccinated people. Vaccines remain important tool fighting rising proportion breakthrough cases suggests even people vaccinated potentially significant spreaders coronavirus, especially delta variant. reinforces vaccinated people also wear masks public settings. ...at moment. Austin supposed predict delta surge? 5 months ago vaccination efforts looked like put pandemic behind us. skip cancer? would make things really awkward. That’s pretty amazing considering  Covid infection getting vaccine.  Meanwhile Florida, grandchildren start school Monday. unvaccinated friends ""afraid"". everything make sure get shot.

My cousin's daughter (Covid nurse) three young people die hospital. One 28. well.  specifically vaccination rate, wrote comment sources covid deaths demographic.  need source pretty much source I've seen suggests overweight obesity big factor covid19 severity.

I realize people especially athletes BMI wrong ideal overweight range let's kid thinking BMI good indicator health average american. Nice! Hit ‘greatest hits’! Ma'am, Wendy's Pretty sure hypertension common comorbidity covid hypertension highly correlated obesity...

Not sure getting from. That's good point compare cases vs. vaccination % per county, damn that'd lot work lol

It seems like common sense start collecting data....which may already case. get Coronavirus mutates 20% fast influenza, difference many people simultaneously gets many chances roll dice mutate. don’t like watched. nice feet though. government evil allowed watch feet Hell young kid minor cough he's getting tested mother right now. probably allergies (moderate levels pollen here) we're taking chance. test comes back positive we'll isolate bit sure. huge uptick positive cases people UNvaccinated, I'm going continue give fuck.

Well big deal moment sudden heart issue appendicitis, find hospitals full. leaky boat puts us danger. breakthroughs mean Sad hear deaths, truly wonder pastors definition healthy is. people recognIze obesity legitimate, scary health concern. Curious 4 obese. got downvoted saying day. sure why.

It's Reddit .. That's People either get vaccinated sick. Life continue normal. 

I already get yearly flu shot. yearly Covid shot doesn’t bother me. What’s right stubbornly refusing get vaccinated protect us all? So...you like watched? Kinky!! 

What thoughts feet? non-hispanic white Americans may loudest covid deniers (dominate top political party, influence media) largest overall population (largest demographic block giving largest raw death numbers), per capita dying least vs demographics. Unless pre existing health conditions mean higher risk, no.

Most likely got would either notice suffer mild symptoms. really unlucky MIGHT confined bed day two. Idiots exist everywhere yes. 47 million least one dose vaccine tho thats ecouraging. Oh did? Restaurants helping government track people covid? thought places wanted number let know table ready delta much contagious, much higher death rate original?

I'm curious knowing higher death rate change minds vaccine anxious Major cities US already this. live, people keep QR vaccine cards Apple/Google wallet. definitely driven behavior. people shifted ""learning live COVID"". Even though initial scare Delta, that's largely gone away too. People age dragging us again. base absolutely praising this, literally donning hero freedom choices.

But keep mind, something us too, ARENT getting news are, base isn’t getting articles titled “covid records broken X amount days,” no, they’re getting “DeSantis proves liberals wrong ____” Everything that’s mentioned twisted way “DeSantis proves health experts/scientists/liberals wrong” makes seem though he’s fantastic midst this.  % reported King County, WA. 65% total population vaccinated. 35% population getting 81% cases is... wild. Imagine uninformed really like pensions cause social security taxed me, interesting thing 20% cases vaccinated people. seems broadly line seen elsewhere Delta era.  Minerals next 🙋 Backing comment pictures (figures 2 3a/b)

tl;dr adjusted overall population size/age hispanic non-hispanic black Americans dying covid. great experience concert back 2012 

It's always cool shit Limp Bizkit shitty music, dammit, let people enjoy like hurting someone else.    meant Disney world. I'm Canadian. Disney Disney. Except poor even much! Masks distancing heavy lifting last year. transmissible strain plus removal almost mitigation measures put us position despite vaccines.  Huh? I’m already far paid salary cut would incentive working remotely. 

Unfortunately that’s likely would happen, maybe first long term would likely bring corporate America closer meritocracy time eliminates bull shitting politicking way top. immediately, eventually output start matter more. might true, however able type name , bday CA state website found vaccine history fast…I card phone. depends state really need name bday Well yeah, basically can't retire CalPers CalSters early. pension full benefits 67 20 years service, 62/20. Public pensions they're made be, especially see much contribution fund every month 😳  46% population that's unvaccinated make 81% cases.

Specific individuals may able take it, oncologist's lack recommendation immunocompromised people general, find new one. consensus people prioritized, ignored. 

The evidence far take handful tragic anecdotes could coincidental. issue aren’t eligible locals vaccinated? get negative cases? e.g. ""Your infinitesimal knowledge/understanding pandemic breakthrough events somehow stop making tall sweeping claims internet"". case knowledge actually small insignificant use ""infinitesimal"" warranted. Breakthrough odds hand quite significant ceratinly ""infinitesimal"". Yeah except nobody find those, what?  semi-enforced Hawaii July 14 August 1.  Whatever base thinks sticking libs. Everyone lose access guns, never drive, always wear masks take point logical extreme.

Instead, logically, businesses, schools etc dictate people inside wear masks/be tested/are vaccinated, probably should.

If people want vaccinated government can't (or rather shouldn't) force them. ""right"" feel risk right. sucks literally likely paying poor response years collectively, can't stretch definitions convenient you. avoid people, let places control, etc, nothing tells bodies government. right bodily autonomy one claim value human rights would state opposition towards.

I also want point right public safety, particularly others vaccinated bullshit argument. extremely small chance dying (as far see vaccines damn near zero) low chance seriously ill. Vaccines far tell, least effective ones, make symptoms covid flu like worst, argument already one built purely exceptions.

The real argument cost us money future, probably true variants booster shots, thats still worried safety, get boosters/pay that.

Imagining position authority state started school yet, seeing states start school effectively create entire caves dead canaries, go ""Nope, gonna change thing, doooo."" hard work pay bills yet also stay home young children. people can't afford stay home virtual schooling. helps college obligation hold like 5 key players team. Everyone else replaceable. giant money contracts, guaranteed time.

You get vaccine, team. Go waste months career transferring school hopefully mandate simultaneously good program. looked account see troll account. curious get this? like laugh friends thing, lack attention real life completes you? 

I wonder why?  mean lost “all roads private”. even work? you’re saying stretch road 25th 45th street might owned one group one set rules 45th 65th owned someone else potentially different rules drivers know different rules stretch potentially route completely way avoid “drunk road”? see would bring transit supply chains knees basically make impossible get anywhere? happens someone decides private stretch interstate usable them? You’d fine driving 100 miles way every day get work?

I’m sorry society depend survive doesn’t work way and, bringing back topic, sometimes personal freedoms need sacrificed good society depend on.

I don’t know anything taxi monopolies isn’t point thread. point unless think function without society (which means doctors, medicine, public roads, grocery stores, etc) part living society sacrificing individual freedoms good everyone.

Lastly I’m done isn’t going anywhere … every unvaccinated person chooses be. girlfriends mother health issues doesn’t feel comfortable getting it. People choose unvaxed put danger basically force permanently home bound it’s risky go anywhere everyone turning political personal freedom thing. Anitvaxers essentially taking freedom away think personal freedom ultimate goal everyone (or you?) also problem family member could find position day.

There reason anarchist semi anarchist state survives long it’s people wanted follow rules. It’s everyone else would constant danger rules didn’t exist recognize need.

Edit: say “your GFs mom still free go out” … choice dying dying isn’t “choice” people forced make don’t want to. Perhaps invite DeSantis funerals tell families proud loved one gave his/her life rights. Onion? let you. could ramp manufacturing capability across globe, since chances last time we're going need quickly roll vaccine something serious, probably use technology ""annoyance"" class diseases meantime. Yeah money tho (not take, see happening).  According Bloomberg yesterday passed 4.4 Billion worldwide doses!

Days from:

0-400M: 94 days

400-800M: 27 days (April 13th)

800M-1.2B: 22 days (May 5th)

1.2- 1.6B: 16 days (May 21st)

1.6B- 2B: 13 days (June 3rd)

3.6 - 4B: 11 days (July 29th)

4 - 4.4B: 9 days (August 7th)

Great stuff! Current 7 day worldwide average 42.6M/day, close peak 43.2M/day, China vaccinating teens gave significant boost, also, Japan close vaccinating 1.5% population day, great stuff despite hate got hosting SUCCESFUL olympics. Insightful comment. “vaccinated individuals spread Covid easily unvaccinated ones”

Which everyone, including vaxxed, wearing masks. Masks primarily capture exhale. Masks part layered approach.  Narrator: “They won’t.”

If don’t care health… probably won’t care neighbors either. Racism soft expectations. brave can’t imagine would feeling without vaccinated. 

Yeah, keep hearing answer usually seems “exactly felt, went typical unvaccinated Covid last dose April 4th, 4 months, wondering makes difference.

Possible yeah. That's good, I'm glad. I'm still curious though areas US healthcare created kind relationship, can't imagine avoiding doctors buying new meds I'm afraid debt, job/marriage could influence insurance relating basic healthcare. imagine side effects mentality patient vs healthcare system.  That's great hear! Definitely write updates get it.

I talked family members nervous well (like panic attacks leave, etc.) decided ready, literally felt nothing either dose. end, said worrying worse actual vaccine, super happy done. protected, longer think it.

My advice get it: eat well, drink tons water, relax. anxiety, write feel *beforehand* compare feel afterwards. really helps lot separate things like that, anxiety often physical well.

You'll fine :) someone lives Durham, 100% this. I'd really like understand path mask mandate looks like without vaccination mandate. we're gonna sit mask mandate months without requiring vaccines, we're treading water. progressive, first state make vaccines required things like DPAC, restaurants, etc. Uncontrolled high blood pressure much, much, much likely kill vaccine, including ones Covid. also makes extremely vulnerable severe Covid infected. need get taken care ASAP.

But meanwhile, need run walk nearest clinic get vaccine. still confronting original virus, precautions could enough protect you. Delta, much contagious, precautions nearly effective.

PLEASE. go. today, right now. everything everyone told you, still can’t force yourself, least go get n95 masks seal well face. Double masking often causes gaps rather improving fit mask, gaps let virus in. Cloth masks surgical masks don’t provide anywhere near protection well fitted n95 unless absolutely everyone around wearing too.   much different situation COVID last year. didn’t 3 effective vaccines widely available last year. Capacity limits even tougher sell people get shots.  bad take. Saban done reduce vaccine hesitancy college football coaches. Got people come talk mRNA vaccines disease. Asking people concept humanity beyond really laughable part That's family always said terms broad statistics like this, nah, pretty good. Like, number people much muscle makes obese EXTREMELY rare. Body builders enhanced athletes shit. besides, lot health risks fat purely sheer size heart lungs support, amount food need maintain huge muscle mass make susceptible things like high blood pressure cholesterol  Asymptomatic cases never estimated 500% like suggesting. 20-40% yes, like one case every 2 symptomatic cases. Hispanic refers people speak Spanish, actual language call Spanish. Good! gtfo outta here. solution get shots.

What done boost vaccine manufacturing?

Literally successful thing US focus manufacturing. leading producer vaccines prior pandemic, one reason country often left alone early vaccine deals. one thought US would producing vaccines level originally. key increase number doses instead wasting time fighting allocations. Yeah Im sure kids equally burnt can’t imagine would feeling without vaccinated. last dose April 4th, 4 months, wondering makes difference. Yuuup  like inside covid-infected persons lung. Well done keep up. May vaccines might well give country like Bhutan third shot. Oh didn’t know that. Thanks Ty. Needless. 

God, people stubborn lied to.  possible vaccinated people spread deadly variants kill antivaxxers higher rate vaccinated mild symtoms. anyone keep close eye this, things get serious get cold 70f. So, many places me. much affordable moved here.

Son graduate HS 5 years, think going somewhere else. Moderna makes mRNA vaccine. mRNA detrimental effect since body already makes make proteins. carrier agent, PEG actually tons stuff basis number laxatives (as also used excipient many pharmaceutical products.

Like Tylenol basis many skin creams (as cetomacrogol) personal lubricants (frequently combined used number main ingredient paint (known ""fill"") paintballs.

And I've eaten plenty last one time playing paintball. Considering 30 years ago... yeah problems probably would manifested every person that's played paintball. No, never them. According unvaccinated father Fauci “quack”. Fauci politicized much masks were. I’m kinda you. Hesitancy isn’t wrong. said, people vaccine 18 months (study participants) tsunami information reputable sources explaining safety efficacy. time hesitancy over. present ID mine Michigan  I'm tryin'. :) need flu shot now!

With pretty nasty asthma lack masking/low vaxx rates feels like I'm living war zone. Also lack CDC guidance mandates public gatherings I'm harder time avoiding crowds winter. lot community service elderly want put risk either. Lol that’s source? 100% guarantee either lied you, lying us. story doesn’t even make sense. Mobile phones already location tracking, government doesn’t need assistance cooperation restaurants. 

From perspective, methodology would inefficient tracking people can’t possibly true. Thanks laugh opinion got it. Likely according  Basically patient estate cannot pay, state winds picking bill. 100% people vaccinated 100% cases breakthrough. sure useful metric. guys worse evangelicals. 😂 It’s like religion all.  federal contractor south, doubt people job site lie. got memo this, everyone else did. point conventional narrative been, ""once vaccinated pandemic party without masks."" Well-intentioned people overpromised get people take vaccine. couldn’t headline say “81% CA COVID cases among unvaccinated” hope too. think fall school going absolute shitshow way vaccines now. Kids missed much school now, we’re going year 3 school peril basically. searched specific mortality rate figures, couldn’t find good source quickly. intentionally left part vague, saying “roughly about”.

No matter mortality rate is, 600,000 Americans process described above. 

I edit comment remove specific rate. point still stands. [Ha ha true, always attach reason pointing out. People color historically abused neglected American healthcare system. given good reason trust us. hear sales numbers really killing it. Hey now, can’t forget Abbott here. He’s worked really hard jackass hate. wonder vaccinated not. people valued science religion conspiracy theory invested education decades ago. get hospitalized covid also refuse experimental drugs using save covid patients lives? different story then? That's ambiguous nearly anything. Wish knew earlier... looking found whites blacks Hispanics 5-10% varying state. different rhetoric I’ve heard. real MVP Asian groups always 10-20% everybody else. right. employers right fire decline hire them. job gives credits toward health insurance. basically, let’s say get 100 credits. could use 75 expensive health insurance skip dental, example. could opt cheapest plans spend rest days off, etc.

There’s rumors receiving “credits” get vaccinated  can't fathom people needed vaccinated church state telling else there? feel sorry church obviously cares. Well wont. Yes, think soon vaccination available children 12.

And nothing base on, really won’t vulnerable people longer. shouldn’t people get vaccinated. % low? enough access vaccines hesitant?  don’t even care keep ignorance; don’t believe works get fuckin’ thing please like time Juggalos smarter people cancelled juggalo thing. Makes everyone else look bad Limp Biskit making wiser choices many.  road trip south. I’m vaccinated, job back hybrid model. I’ll back home 8/15. Wfh 8/16, office 8/17. respect coworkers - vaccinated friends kids I’ll seeing following weekend, I’d like get tested going back office - even I’m showing symptoms (is necessary?)

Will good getting tested 8/16? soon? Maybe wait till Tuesday? Good luck completely clogging course frivolous libel cases “liberal media” protein subunit vaccines like Novavax get EUA - hopefully happen soon - MAYBE convince small percentage antivaxxers get 'tried tested technology' (same flu vaccines existed decades) we’d used emergency status throw money really fast something worked  vast, vast majority cases unvaccinated people

Masks primarily intended capture exhale. Think operating room. surgeons RNs masked. masks protect person operated on, protect surgeons RNs. need wear masks. African Americans diligent wearing masks tho, least community live. UK vaccinated CFR under-50s 0.035%. deaths would mostly people 40s I'm sure; under-30s risk prior vaccination already level that. research saying vaccinated people [recover long COVID (most likely) concern either. legit concerned spreading others (over-50 breakthrough CFR 1%), afraid yourself. Nah it’s perfectly usable average person regardless race. It’s really good athletes bodybuilder types since muscle throws off. that’s also readily apparent looking someone  Ironic called Impact Church, believe virus IMPACTed church directly.  vaccines paid USA ? vaccines hard get USA? kinda them.

Here Europe regions turbo low vaccination rates vaccines free widely available people don’t get elect death gamble. can’t much people purposefully skewing information. matter clear CDC is, people twist it. handle factual data.

Pardon me, _met_ us?? Elderly people under-represented trials over-represented current environment vaccine efficacy.

“After second vaccination, 31.3 % elderly detectable neutralizing antibodies contrast younger group, 2.2% detectable neutralizing antibodies.”

We likely expect 60-70% population protected neutralizing antibodies.
No neutralizing antibodies means protected infection, although doesn’t suggest protection severe disease.

Source: terms change seroprevalence vaccine trials now. trials year ago 5% people recovered Covid-19. Right number closer 30%. Natural infection offers similar protection vaccination. Doesn’t hurt. got tested day known exposure mild symptoms came back negative. Tested 2 days later positive, worse symptoms well even though pretty mild. change reality. Ok, could explain badly, could instead look digital signatures. I'm sure must tons videos YouTube concerned attention given so-called “breakthrough” infections may helping fuel vaccine resistance — even though people vaccinated far less likely suffer serious illness.



No shit. Especially headlines. Even biblical apocalypse outright kill ""most"" people once. Though eventually universe ended that's kind story is, nothing humans nothing happens earth end universe. course want extremely pedantic literal nothing apocalyptic never use word again. colloquial English means extreme bad devastating outcome. want literal, covid death tolls made 10x worse could well literally decimate global population ends. would certainly enough decimate become infected. Possibly decimate many times over.

If covid 10x deadlier would meant 6+ million deaths US 43 million globally now. AIDS since global outbreak really took 1980. fatality rate 10-30% enormously high, disease highly communicable covid that's pretty apocalyptic. Right US averaging 100k+ cases per day. would mean 10-30k people getting death sentence every single day. 

In US average 2.7-3 million people generally die year. talking doubling total number annual deaths, top normal number deaths. combine huge increase preventable deaths due enormous strain health systems, number people would take lives scenario. 

Our leading cause death US heart disease, kills 650k people year. disease pop kill ten times number single year could well described apocalyptic. 

If add vaccine resistance meaning even slow down? Yeah that's great. 

I understand people go lengths convince feel emotional stable, confident, comfortable despite ongoing extremely deadly pandemic. bridge far say making ten times worse taking away vaccines would ""suck."" Something kill 51% people described apocalyptic. say 'person gets covid' '1/50' chance death disingenuous COVID mortality starts low ages 20 (order magnitude 1/10000) goes exponentially age ca 15% age. said, even young ages dangers long term sequelae ('Long Covid') real, getting vaccinated makes perfect rational sense young people well. Colorado data (from governor health department recent press conference) indicates vaccinated people 80% less likely test positive 90%+ less likely hospitalized die. course, latter understates vaccine protective effects, since vulnerable vaccinated. Imagine that! That’s said, though. Can’t much low-information people make life death decisions without bothering actually inform themselves. guess I'm wondering computer/coding smart someone generate static QR code says ""signed authority"" QR reader. worked really really fast vaccine frustrating part subreddit throughout last year. People absolutely shitting teachers sides, regardless political affiliation, without regard health teachers students. Yes, numbers low kids. large part kids sheltered COVID general. seeing could potentially happened (at lesser scale due lesser virulent nature previous variants) took zero mitigations regards children.

Mind you, right now, currently vaccines available. opened full stop last year vaccine UK variant running rampant know would happened. offering opinion whether lot little; point actually provides meaningful number reader make assessment themselves. Saying something like ""19% cases among vaccinated people"" really tell anything, know percentage population vaccinated order interpret it. extreme, 100% population vaccinated, 100% cases would vaccinated people, tells us absolutely nothing.  90% adults Scotland first dose, can’t wait 90% fully vaccinated next months hopefully really safely move forwards Thanks repeating said post. mean, that’s specified depends risk factor. You’re higher risk, yes, would want adjust life around stay safer. Even then, unless severe issues, you’re probably still fine, though that’s risk that’s understandable want take.

As far know, haven’t seen much long covid vaccinated folks, though I’m sure still happens. said, vaccinated folks likely asymptomatic covid, makes long covid less likely.

The school aspect part think concerning. Though, everyone could vaccinated children masked up, wouldn’t major issue. signed bit important factor. information, signed authority Right, even undersells effective vaccines are, significant fraction unvaccinated recovered COVID protection that's factored in. can't possibly aware every cancellation everywhere. know city live in,.. big free music festival typically happens August (a couple days ago) cancelled. (even already started pre-positioning ""Street closure"" signs Apartment building already gotten communication ""reserved parking"" us 3 4 blocks away (since Festival, streets around building usually closed)). I'm honestly bit relieved hear this.. 3 days noise drama I'd rather without,. know many local businesses depend tourism. 

The New Orleans Jazz Festival also cancelled: sure there's probably small time local festivals cancelled,. observed,. there's way aware them. One thing world badly getting sophisticated different kinds masks. 

We conducting wartime level N95 mask production since early last year, made goal produce 9 billion N95 masks distribute world's population.

Instead, farting around surgical masks, cloth masks, t-shirts nose mouth, whatever weird thing someone could dream up. existing technological solution could actually put use. least trying something; least sort hoop parents must get through. Yeah elementary schools podded also secondary alternating pod schedules masks worked really good. It’s England masks longer mandated. Scotland away social distancing tomorrow ‘in situations’. big spike recently people cautious since but…. Whhhadddaaaabbbbouuttttt this?  Novavax supposed making 600M doses month starting April. 4 months later AFAIK still large-scale production.

It super weird US Europe working approve zero-side effect vaccines (protein subunit inactivated), especially kids. could ideal boosters, possibly part annual flu shot package.  Pretty scary phone dies haha. shut society would walk home. expecting many variants? Yeah, that's really stupid way measure. California would 100% vaccination rate 100% COVID cases would breakthrough.

And breakthrough anticipated, otherwise efficacy would 100%.  Good luck Godspeed. took 2 years feel normal mono worry long covid reason. Shh call mandate. Schools can't ""mandates"" thanks Governor Asshole. really, breakthrough mean die. could cold like symptom. Could tested positive even though idea sick. Basically things people masks saying normal covid was. “Oh shit, actually starting affect personally…” please share see “top five”? Don’t Asians really high vaccination rates too?   According [singapore study significantly different vaccinated vs unvaccinated. 14 days seems high end vaccinated. (Note 0 point graph symptom onset possibly first positive test, infection/exposure.) delta probably can't guarantee unvaccinated. +100. wife’s company requires masks pre-Covid?! nuts. mean, they’re probably right it’s “just flu” terms prognosis. It’s given year don’t get kids catching flu. Spend time looking mask efficacy data online may conclude none exists. reasonable conclusion mask efficacy results low fit current narrative, aka can't handle truth.

No back baseless talking points. Reasonable conclusions generated ""said so"".

These declarations updated many times. Efficacy data verified independent testing lab year ago masks, even started using them. carry CE UL markings.

[Manufacturer index page](http://powecom.com/index.html)

 [EU Declarations Conformity](http://powecom.com/eng_Declaraton_of_Conformity.html)

The shape size virus change. Therefore masks become less efficient, Delta variant virus shed infected individuals higher concentrations, shed vaccinated individuals, factors renewed mask recommendations/mandates areas.

The efficacy masks reducing transmission question. tenacity anti-mask/anti-vax sentiment US causing people needlessly harmed killed, exactly arbitrarily claim un-supported/non peer-reviewed *feelings* masks taken seriously.

If convince someone willing wear mask stop wearing it, get infected, could spread virus many others. Take care say. can’t live life forever covid.

This depressingly common take. basically saying ""I going ignore reality situation reasons.""

If ""living life"" means ""doing things make pandemic worse,"" get all. Extremely EXTREMELY rough! don’t know one person area that’s vaccinated. It’s sad - it’s coming pretty fast huge carnival downtown yesterday . around 50% population vaccinated fully California atm Third possibility variant exhibits ADE, kills vaccinated. possible, though pharma experts claim unlikely. think roughly translates this, bit plainer english:

If compare vaccine trials real-world situation today, differences. Vaccination rate increases age, look vaccinated population, heavily skews older. Plus unvaccinated population longer low immunity compared mid last year. two things going make vaccine efficacy look relatively lower even nothing vaccine changed (such decreased efficacy time, decreased efficacy vs variant); older vaccinated population going vulnerable tested, unvaccinated population become less vulnerable it. ratio vaccinated unvaccinated cases get warped negative direction compared expect trials. You’re right, people needed hear currently ER/ICU. mutates vaccines ineffective? want know symptoms. want hear much possible fully vaccinated people’s covid symptoms ease fully vaxxed friend currently covid said like bad head cold shortness breath. Today feeling sneezy. 

Sounds little unique Delta variant original virus infected Wuhan spread everywhere else. Fever cough common previously (on average anyway far people symptomatic concerned, vary person person). Delta seems give people sinus, runny nose, cold-like symptoms saw before. fair excuse POC? Wonderful news. Yep.

From tell dude's grifting white supremacist. genuinely don’t understand DeSantis’s strategy killing base. want trust politicians... ffs dont try get medical information politician, far realm expertise (in cases). 

Wtf approval rating ever bs stat threw even comment posted too.  No, meant it, compass? implying piece trash morals one point. heroin. idea! Genuinely curious could considered fraud way (particularly lying saying health insurance order get third dose). 

I think ought illegal gov everything support vaccinations cases. ""because republicans"" damn causing Germany's covid peaks, Indian variant.

Trump sure didnt help, we'd shit matter  not. looking get help research declined.  I'm sure cases could apply covid vaccines, vaccines general. there's fact times basically Middle Ages medicine compared Moderna almost like getting 6 doses Pfizer. works. law. insurance companies totally refuse cover treatment unvaccinated covid cases, least jack fees. Something financial ruin clears shit brain.  Amen post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:
  
[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  must living rock think that. nurse friend went celebrate engagement, knowing cases time high 2020. vaccinated.

My friends repeatedly turning hanging good year, would constantly rag us one worse comes exposure. even went fucking Florida cases worst 2020. came unscathed, unfortunately made smugger it. logic, driving drunk legal too. bad, thank you! didn’t say neither side deserves blame disagreed ridiculous notion Biden Harris turned anyone vaccine. don’t think Trump either. Wouldn’t say meaningless I’ve got handful friends dealing pretty crappy residual stuff covid cases.  hospitalization death.  people 30s annoying crap deal with.  initials JP chance? article linked thread:

*""Nationwide least 540 COVID-19 deaths children age 17 younger since start pandemic""*

I'm dismissing deaths, context important. US 630,000+ deaths, number, 540 17 younger.

Is Delta hitting kids harder Beta original COVID? surprised, think keep facts ground mind.  line certainly harmful actions directly affect parties detrimental way. DeSantis also misleading public. He's telling issue. hospitals fine. He's obscuring data collection. Meanwhile approval rating slipping. Currently around 43%. fucking conspiracy man's words. God go watch damn interviews talks it. ""according firm's chief executive"" Looking back history really obvious religion created purpose initially anyway.

A smart person realized could unite people purpose pretense rules created called higher being. body ready. Makes wonder happen everyone vaccinated. spread stop new mutations run population again? lawsuit early 1900s said could already that. Nothings happened yet.  Side effects death Delta… Essentially, bunch losers conspiracy nnn convinced country shutting next week.

From tell source alt right grifter/qnut claims ""sources Harris administration"". love you. Florida insane right now, Covid case rates surpassing already last January’s peak currently increasing looks like exponentially, death rates catching up, unvaccinated Florida meet head hard objective reality, protect kids! say ""broken"", lol. Even Republicans change tone medical services become unavailable. last year.  Yea buy basically I'm saying. Everyone thinks right side things, gives justification wrong things like stifle people's individual liberty. believe everyone side increased government authority good person good intentions. That's I'm always told, think extremely unlikely true.

This comment basic markers ideology. First, place side good, use justify actions support. Also convenient enemy blame everything that's going wrong pandemic implied last sentence. short, good someone place blame on. Ideology. saying I'm immune line thinking btw, probably time. But, best recognize simplifying things much, also good idea question motivations really are. lot people good claim. give right forcibly inject something, gives right fine refuse vaccine. fine you. like jail cut finger - go fear mongering acting could punishment fine. precedent 116 years, notion government could start punishing however please ridiculous. even possible would would mean Judicial branch government fallen. would coup possible.


In scenario compulsory vaccine free refuse simply pay fine (something still looks *very* unlikely happen). Meanwhile even allowed (refuse without exemption) school vaccinations must medical exemption. 2002, federal district court find exemption mandatory vaccinations laws “sincerely held religious beliefs” fundamental right parents make decisions concerning medical procedures children.




Freedom ‘self-government,’ self-government requires responsibility. one freedom infringe another person’s freedoms/rights. reason governments &amp; Justice systems created, police departments needed. 


Human rights give people right protected harm. Covid poses major public health risk - people unvaccinated choice, cannot yet get vaccinated, children age 12 people allergic vaccine ingredients immunocompromised.

The Delta variant one infectious respiratory diseases ever known could overwhelm healthcare system even worse first time, would prevent people treated diseases injuries. infectious eventually two groups: vaccinated infected (the infected infected simultaneously course).

Even legal precedent almost certainly impose blanket compulsory vaccination covid. let's honest, comparing vaccination Equilibrium forced sterilization like saying ""worst case scenario taxation everyone becoming *literal* slaves government."" really stretching. Jizz moppets rich tradition vaccination promoted well located major intersection town one stoplight, gas station, family dollar, liquor store, library, elementary school located. saw advertised neighborhood social media (FB &amp; ND), 3 pro-vaccine comments hundred anti-vaccine comments. extremely disappointing. Unsurprisingly, anti comments primarily elderly people certain political persuasion. Parents used chicken pox parties kids get immunity. 

I see anti vax mommies Covid parties policy. keeping protocols last year. Last first year get sick anything. plan keeping streak going long possible. seems like either read wrote, understand it. appologies misunderstood, clarify: I'm huge fan vaccines, believe mandated.

I'm stating obvious anti-vaxxers wil, nature behavior, significantly likely reinfected rest us. That's literally correlation causation. crazy thing returning normal. Everyone going back work, school, etc. smart ones says ""this nuts"" forced to. drove East Coast Texas back week, assure you: regardless data show, pandemic South.  Absolutely. misinformation. vaccine reduces chance severe disease / death ~half. Like influenza vaccine does. Pretty common. 
But combine reduced chance even *getting* virus, really help block transmission, that's get 95% numbers we've seen.  
 
 [The data shows protection mortality Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine even higher – around 69% – confirmed cases second dose least 7 days prior positive 
 [When combined estimated protection becoming case, equivalent estimated 97% protection mortality individuals vaccinated 2 doses Pfizer-BioNTech 
 
 
Keep mind numbers pre-Delta.  
 
There still compelling reason want get infected vaccinated. There's lot stories vaccinated people getting, mild even symptoms. lot attributed vaccine reducing effects disease, remember virus ever 10% hospitalization rate begin with.  
 
It's kind like climate change, hard pin one hurricane global warming not. 
 
The point vaccine *only* reducing severity disease get it. originally meant *mostly* transmission blocking that's way better way things. Let's move goal post. 
 
We get vaccinated slow spread save people's lives. tool required beat pandemic. still need wear masks avoid risky places. can't go totally back pre-pandemic behavior got shot. city didn’t many good jobs. We’re military town. It’s service industry town army money injected economy. unless you’re medical field, job likely shit job shit pay. 10% city isn’t military makes good money get vaxxed employer mandates. everyone else could give shit jobs. town, you’re either old money, military, working poor little between. people FB claimed side effects long. skeptical, knows? way know sure going parents get tested. Idk let people make decisions, florida survives tourism past year rough them. risk/reward... still easy get vaccinations anywhere usa. Tell go get tested. Absolutely agree you. Christian myself, hate people use “God protect me” excuse. Jesus *specifically * talks this:

“And took Jerusalem set pinnacle temple said him, “If Son God, throw here, written, “‘He command angels concerning you, guard you,’ “‘On hands bear up, lest strike foot stone.’” Jesus answered him, “It said, ‘You shall put Lord God test.’”
‭‭-Luke‬ ‭4:9-12‬

To walk around needlessly viable protection testing God. like equate driving car without seatbelt. Bingo - calculating risk. Desantis also making hard possible get accurate information COVID - daily data, per-hospital data, hospitals forbidden disclose information. 

So game rigged, 1% Florida actively infected, that's problem.

And wait till bills start coming hospitalized dead... ""Steep rise hospitalizations statewide, vaccine distribution also rising."" Lesser mean transmitting. still transmit many people think ""I vaccinated fck social distanciation hand washing"" since damn government said cannot transmitted vaccinated (yes yes say 💀). point vaccinated people thinking immune going dangerous non vaccinated people still respecting rules social distancing wearing masks lol.

And say person fully vaccinated.

Also guess policemen politician transmit Covid 19 cause heavenly beings then. 

You can't ask people believe they've lied much. Wait minute. Who’s weirdo sentence? linked separate post thread. must get lot, almost nobody thinks it’s government hoax. Blame selfish people refused vaccinate, social distance, wear masks.    hate bearer bad news, long nearly half country refuses vaccinate, way people know vaccinated, masks practical solution.

I sympathize that's inconvenient you, much like seat belt condom bit inconvenience, reality situation we're mild inconvenience one tools disposal reduce impacts current health crisis speed return normalcy. Shit got it, took week off, got paid it. I'm super excited know. Gotta others Government protecting citizens goes brrr extent line... I'm surgeon I'm free ""choose"" smoke wear gloves wash hands. logic think LTC nurse able choose get vaccinated (for example). would never work. They’d start new civil war blood would run streets anyone let get forcibly injected government.  No. reason consider invalid. 

Health professionals, parents, consider perfectly valid.  Bye. company, smallish ~1200 employees contractors, mandating vaccines employment want building attend company events need vaccinated.

We pretty robust WFH culture though major thing pandemic too, team 60% week. terms responsible pandemic leadership, Governor equivalent DeSantis throwing cinderblocks highway overpass?  Yes, sense mission purpose harder capture medical staff miced feelings. Plus patients putting staff staff families risk covid vaccine refusal. Individuals could get vaccinated medical reasons generate anger. patients especially vulnerable severe covid thru health issues like transplant, immune disorders, etc    rebutted point though. data shows correlation? We've going back forth hours yet provide any. mandates worked, would correlation. Where's correlation? say broad statement. Hurting could mean physically, emotionally, financially, mentally etc…so yes want make decision could theoretically put risk things doesn’t affect anyone else think able make choice

DeSantis imposing things constituents actions, lack thereof still early tell. data incomplete science always changing. number vaccinated hospitalizations nil couple months ago exploded since then. numbers go up. ignore numbers like Trump did. fact currently happening cause alarm. Covid hospitalizations low beginning too. vaccine performing intended purpose. good do? encourages people get vaccinated! JFC. kind question this? Fine.

Just don’t complain/grieve someone know ends *not* able “live it”. Lot people saying said, think it’s happening *them.*  would illegal? I'm happy say we're zero reported cases! world population received least one dose COVID-19 vaccine. far over, next decades, particularly bad variants going pop up.

I’m talking US. poll Americans cited, poll world. cares? technically correct assume baseline underestimate progress. cares? arguing this?

It’s absurd people think worst ahead us US 70 % adults least one dose. I’d like welcome civilized society. first time taking part? act like getting people sick hardship shouldn’t endure social expectation thousands years. Yeah, surely trust government one. lie us like crysis, right? Lol what? Explain study says saying. looked like vaccine antibodies good mutations, fucking causing them. gathered, article linked mostly talks efficacy vaccine vs newer strains. quote specific part proves you’re saying?    people put health risk, turn put risk. 

They're putting health risk. Restrictions sake unvaccinated people want anyway dumb wastes time. restrictions I'm okay prevent many simultaneous hospitalizations.  Go Gators! “everyone” knew this, wouldn’t responding someone clearly *doesn’t* know this… suspect got Zostavax (the old shingles vaccine), years later Shingrix came got better vaccine. guess (and guess) maybe immune system primed Zostavax reacted strongly Shingrix vaccination. day fever illness Shingrix shots.

Still recommend getting vaccine getting shingles, though! past Spring masks still mandatory district students faculty (when approved locally, vaccinated faculty allowed remove masks students left building). least half students classroom refused wear masks correctly masks would continuously slip noses “they don’t fit”. offered walk adjusting/tightening masks sent nurse’s office child size mask show next day another ill-fitting mask excuse parent threw new mask away. 

Less month school starts I’d lying said looking forward it. Glad hear it!  ironic people dragging whole thing ones refuse get vaccinated. can't believe almost 2022 we're still living covid life point. There’s two problems that.

First: America corporation, truth determined dollar value.

Two: people would take facts twist bias, Facebook pages heartbeat. Leaving situation worse. way topic, Queen Bhutan beautiful woman planet. Google her. people get vaccinated, leave. Meaning crazies remain.

Muahahaha!  think need boosters point agree countries like India need vaccines much. India billion people need ton vaccines. current vaccines still work - even good extent Delta

Also, need require everyone returning coming US vaccinated entering flying question. think enough republican voters/supporters rob learn horrible experience infected covid(having severe symptoms/hospitalization) would shift people voting democrats governor? I’ve never needed provide vaccination history visitor US. Different story Greencard document vaccinations don’t HIV (presumably discriminate gay immigrants) amongst things. law Texas says hospital's must protect patients infectious disease. Florida one?  Don’t DeSanitize Florida  unlikely enough people meet criteria even one sees this.

The people got covid got vaccinated group highest level antibodies. ask buses were? mean, people walking Texas Florida. think someone would noticed convoy buses filled illegal immigrants, lol.    ton people unable get vaccine d/t things like organ transplants, chemotherapy, compromised immune system, maybe they're hospitalized already illness, etc. Unvaccinated people go public drunk drivers, self centered ""I care myself"" go again. sucks what's alternative? Let's assume allowed 11.9 year olds get vaccine, question raised 11.8 year olds forth.

You boundary somewhere. Well going take weeks newly vaccinated people fully vaccinated.   gotta admit though kind weird job starts enforce ""healthy behavior"". Already see jobs giving $100 bonuses people download health apps log exercising. like company regulating health pay less employee health insurance. grimy fuck sort invasive. authorities Austin, Texas, warned public Saturday city’s Covid-19 situation grown desperate, surge cases driven Delta variant swamped hospitals city officials prevented issuing mandates masks vaccinations order state’s governor, Greg alert sent via text, phone call, email, social media channels people area Saturday, city authorities said: “The Covid-19 situation Austin dire.

I'd think least dystopian way would get vaccinated. That's beat smallpox, beat polio, reduced measles minor threat. Etc. People suddenly deciding vaccines somehow threat personal freedom little idea human history. Average lifespans used absurdly short due endemic diseases eliminated pushed margins vaccination.

I've vaccinated kinds diseases, worry them. I've vaccinated covid, I'm worried. state, however, mandate protect citizens, even they're fucking stupid protect themselves. 

A vaccine mandate place long time kids going school, works. covid vaccine mandate makes kinds sense. fuck, NY you? Im lower westchester, 2 schools already mandating masks, district better well.

But want avoid catching Covid, want see virus reduce spread, concerning 25% we're fully vaccinated. Japanese government finding “Do say, do” effective COVID-19 strategy. wearing seat belt hurt people though.

The point stands. Immunocompromised people always increased risk infections. COVID obviously gotten worse think people realizing tenuous health/existence is. species survive plague plague plague (ie Black Death, smallpox, HIV/AIDS, malaria, Ebola, rubella, Scarlett fever, pneumonia, Spanish flu, etc) make point. immune system amazing defense system. pathogens depend upon defeating survival thus always adapting evolving sicken us. I’d say best defense immunocompromised people follow advice doctors, wash hands religiously, wear mask public, limit exposure sick people, limit time spent crowds/traveling, eat healthy, get good sleep, etc. end though life full risks individual weigh risks/rewards make personal choice. don’t believe society afford lock again. collateral damage : decreased mental health via isolation, economic hardship, failure education children vital professions (think med students learn online versus person real patients), loss trust government/institutions outweighs benefits (data still unclear extend harm reduction vs remaining “open” mitigation measures (ie masking, limited capacity, etc). putting real fear “unvaccinated assholes” start denying health coverage COVID-19 related treatment anti-vaxers?

I get sentiment, slowly drowning death lung fluid alone ICU families waiting crowded lobby catching covid scare them, health insurance going either. don’t buy brains aren’t built Spanish flu gone even longer

Whilst 1918 influenza epidemic lasted longer total, measures combat often lasted months, arriving worse spells fading away after, even though disease still present.

a) people made fear vaccine worse disease

b) people feel need prove bravery. see battle disease. underestimated opponent. See story something like 700k bikers going SD unvaccinated. US vaccine program stalled around 1960 due, part, vaccine hesitancy lack access among urban blacks, rural everyone, Native Americans. like everything old new (exc. Native American part time).

Chapter 11. probably also reject driver's licenses car insurance. u  Ew! You’re probably right. Lol youre mad little child. hope lockdowns never end waste entire life getting booster shots crying reddit No, won’t wear mask get vaccine make tiny bit safer.

The vaccine absolutely makes people safer. However school setting. Common mask usage going effective. Masks effective limiting spread short time exposure situations. Meeting someone minutes (like delivery driver). Incredibly effective, especially paired open air conditions.

 classroom setting shared air 4-6 hour period. TBH Delta, zero percent worth it. Mandate vaccines teachers, mandate vaccines students old enough. Isolate students young pods one teacher dedicated pod, mandate vaccine soon becomes available K+ ages.

Mask mandates schools wrong hill die on. saving ammo vaccination mandates.  Congrats, know serious articles hard follow. surprising. keep number articles history philosophy.

I care ""need"". Institutions fallible. akin Wire West Wing, know that. perfectly understandable distrust government fact countless opportunities taking situation gain power.

I tribalist whore, going hate people disagree things. actually respect anti-vax group speaking serious issues. vaxxed, feel home wackos actually think live world government trusted (well, blue team charge, course. Y'all anti-vaxers last fall red team charge).

Oh, learn reading. context post specific user's comment nothing vaccine. context mandates.  close right, still quite right.

If get infected, initial viral load approximately unvaccinated person. clear virus much rapidly, though, would spread disease much less time. decreases likelihood spreading it.

Papers tried make argument made (""initial viral load = chance spreading disease"") make past peer review. we're trying stop virus, trying get zero covid cases, that's impossible reasonable person ever said that's goal vaccinations, we're trying make endemic issue constantly infecting large swathes people resulting death/long covid get back type normal.

The time stopped virus 2019, longer possible. conflict wanting get many people vaccinated possible.

everything said seasonal likely going case yes. guess majority US count disabled within next 5-20 years, huh? Looking ugly Texas. Stay safe everyone. Doctors nurses work 110% long… never abolish COVID. got live it. long hospitals aren’t full good   Mermexican

Except literally back right made comment explaining logical conclusion said. obviously point logical conclusion something extrapolating person said. quite literally point so.

The literal point point problem argument, missed downplayed public health issue later comment, surge hospitalizations clearly relevant that.

This seems like non sequitur terms following. like sure reply went back previous comment address different point.

Whats more? point literally logic argument already rebutted.

It also completely ignores alternatives yet assuming reason deletion, even though reposting reply contradicts it.

I literally explained based previous occurrences, yet talking hypocritical thing say even addressed point.

??? point make literally point expect different result ???

This simply waste time point. Unless next comment brings track, there's way reasonably expect continue.

Make honest points, stop simply repeating points addressed simply move on. Extrapolating public policy decisions various ends useful way explore try identify negative outcomes externalities. course welcome continue say happening, particularly relevant though. Lambda 2:Electric Bugaloo? Florida gotten way redder since then. purple anymore like Ohio.  post reminds old quote- paraphrase- ""One death tragedy. million statistic."" completely messed someone whose mom killed surgery nutjob surgeon, sometimes think maybe laws protect marginalized groups hurt surgeons would otherwise refused operate them, backwards sounds.

We're talking like 15 minutes room ""alpha"" bad idea, delta brings minute similar risk. k Actually, majority Americans did.

51.3% (or 81,284,000 / 7,063,000 voted Trump).

So actually minority, way around. Thank encouraging others get it. think immunities fight other, cancel out. dad twice doctor made sure got ASAP (after 2nd negative test.) Anecdotal, medical advice, please consider consulting doctor it. 

Also accepting advice convince hold-outs say things like ""vaccinated people get spread know point is."" don’t rhetoric. Medical journals scientific studies extremely dense information, use extremely specific unusual vocabulary anyone science field. I’m said field, trust friends pharmacists (people know drugs interact body, help treat Covid patients administer vaccine), medical doctors deal stuff day day basis, spent 4 years learning vocab digest said information. 

Again, even standing dissenters saying might point stupid. said think institutions fallable, saying context Covid vaccine dumb fosters distrust system that’s need point. say J&amp;J vaccine bad? study seems bit dubious also. say ""not one 1359  
previously infected subjects remained unvaccinated SARS-CoV-2  
infection duration study"", currently  
flood reports contrary. personal position: research 
 needed; err side caution. Sorry, employers fire people accused crimes time.

The entire #metoo movement saw many many firings based accusations alone, convictions.

You don’t right innocent proven guilty private relationships contracts. That’s government. choose live somewhere mandate vaccine well guess logic. become hermit.  commenting thread got 12-year-old vaccinated side effects got creepy DM someone saying ""tell happens kid years."" cancelled? Oh god, hope niece's life turns ok. 

Her life could really rough developmental delay lasts. :(   that?  find another reason, I'm afraid. agree last points. problem vaccine benefit employee employer. 

If Subway machine store .3% employees used died, adding plastic guard, reduced .003%, would need add guard. case vaccine. know that's simplification, there's literally reason get vaccine millions adult babies can't own, either decide society let die make get vaccinated using tools have, employer government mandated vaccines.

I know pretty, one things local hospital pointed today 2100 people ICU, 94% unvaccinated. simple math, would 20. (That math, think number would like 100). Instead, expect 15 people dead week two, count ones get turned away. 

We running options take care people.  Ooh, good know. shingles shot yet (nor rabies, anticipate offered it.) mean, plan, combined ""don't mind bodies floor"" approach. Honestly? Cause numbers probably alarming they’re committed locking again. comment equally (if more) feel-good unproductive. FL's curve like SpaceX launch Daniel Patrick Moynihan famously said, everyone entitled opinion, facts. guess vaccine lose it’s efficacy get around forcing people submit. Anti vaxxers pro death born people. Ah dang. Humanity really lost good one....yeah ok sounds bit like 1949-52 polio pandemic me. 

How many people going end long-term disabled systemically shut society future due COVID like long-term disabled polio survivors been? told correct interpretation pointing want risk stopped. sad needs explained you. doesnt seem address all

You downplayed public health issue later comment, surge hospitalizations clearly relevant that. assumption

You're assuming reason deletion, even though reposting reply contradicts it. aggressive decreasing depth. 

That's hypocritical thing say even addressed point. Sigh. I'm sure doctors nurses thinking thing right now. Different day, story, another person dying something completely preventable. 

Again, child, young child, enough make anyone want put odds favor survive live pandemic. nope. 

They'll stories like everyday now. Whether they're published social media press, story going repeat again. Natural selection it? I'm Cambodia soon AZ booster.  None. got sick, though know details.  Yes days second joint si joint flared up. usually results spasm difficulty moving / bending over. osteo suspects side effect caused inflammation. Bs! Yes OFC, this? running kind experiment something? tempted fate manner power guess. vaccinated? partner vaccinated? Polio vaccine stopped getting spreading  genuinely understand logic. vaccine-resistant strain likely develop place that's partially vaccinated, virus still spreading rapidly, like United States? United States currently new daily cases, per capita basis, unvaccinated places mentioned article. Lowering death rate prevent variants virus still spreading. nonstarter honestly. There's chance majority people wearing masks next year. fatigue real, especially flipflopping. think propaganda susceptible it. doesn’t matter smart are. lived life antiva probably would also anti-vax tickets October show featuring Testament, Exodus Death Angel (which amazing lineup metal fan). I'm wondering I'll seeing show in, oh, June 2022. bands actually Europe last year Covid-19 first emerged various members three acts got sick. Death Angel's drummer even coma days, though he's apparently made full recovery. 

Needless say, tour suspect quickly postpone cancel delta variant continues get worse. [Link Ochsner also seen uptick pediatric COVID-19 cases. According Ochsner, average age pediatric child admitted hospital COVID-19 5 years old.

Get facts straight bloviating matters expertise even credible knowledge. Honestly, what’s little turnover? actually happening Oregon (which article about). result seeing faster spike ever before, leaders afraid reinstate kind mandate. state, Oregon Health Authority, Multnomah County, many businesses ""strongly recommending"" people wear masks, none instate new mandates (except schools). Making things worse people Multnomah County (the county Portland in) largely pro-mask compliant. Without mandate, though, lot people assume there's real need.

Anyway, folks starting see it, vaccination rates starting go up. I'm sure still core people never change minds, they're going see consequences one way another.  refuse ever get vax, two week lockdown them? Prolong inevitable? I’m stunned one see this.

Anti-vaxxers deserve civility. kidding think Supreme Court gives fuck precedent one might mental illness doesn’t necessarily mean lack common sense anti-vaxer. 

Anti-vax stupid whole different spectrum.  Yeah perfect example scared desperate people answers buy without vents. states anti lockdown majority. I‘m US, I‘d interested knowing situation clubs is. open states? access restricted (testing, proof vaccination)? Germany barely started open Delta hit closed again. doesn‘t look like plans change time soon, frustrating considering could least open vaxxed people. really needed financial incentives got vaccinated instead stimulus check everyone. mask mandates shouldn’t lifted certain percentage people vaccinated state.  People want stoke fear lockdowns reason point question gets posted every hour so. lockdowns happened protection available time, know anything virus, barely even lockdowns. effect people hunkering initiative.

Life complex, sure. pandemic certainly made things increasingly difficult. 

I suppose live city high vaccination rate world class healthcare, I’m observant what’s going areas country may things. liked Jim Acosta's idea, name GOP Governors. watched guy Offspring voice reason pandemic?! underestimated them. said NJ that's live. school districts Chicago, Atlanta, DC, entire state California, almost every place reimplemented mask mandate also never announced plans revisit decision.

In addition, heard there's law saying school districts obey CDC guidance could lose federal funding. I'm sure whether policy applies state Virginia, entire US. accounted vaccines development? would think would never expect 100% able get shot even best case. fully agree something bothered well.

I heard countless times *other party care human lives; want get re-elected matter many people die.

Americans dumb comes vaccines. sometimes think invisible forcefield, virus still enters body, immune system prepared take over. Dang might wanna get everybody two first. Totally agree boosters going name game I'll put way,
I'm fully vaccinated, preplanning past week 100+ faculty, 3 us wearing masks (me included) Already booked appointment proper COVID test plan isolate anyway! I’m really trying part problem much possible.  realized reading weird article sourced anecdotes studies early 2020, long time ago covid years. 

I'm sure relevant point, published now. clear, wrong. spreading disinformation. everything changes ignore laws, reality deal facts, false headlines. Honest question, flu worse kids covid? Name change “Liberty Taxi”, “Freedom Cab” “1776” 3…2…1 Agree 12+, even realistically they'll mandate masks year.

But can't younger children still catch transmit virus? IMHO still wear masks matter what, receive vaccination. Wrong flair. Japan east Asia agree social media problem. original point government counter that? I'd lying said considered it, actually covid vaccinated, L452Q F490S mutations seen lamba variant, along documented changes spike protein, feel safe wait tweaked version vaccine new variants maximum effectiveness. Personal risk assessment... still spread kids immunocompromised. I'm making choice me, others. Execute Order 66 got vaccine keep healthy.

But it’s money, 10k won’t change life much. I’ll bit less debt. win 1mm, sock index funds live 4% year, means never work / live middle class forever. It’s “never work again” lottery. flu worse children covid? Yeah trying give away beer lot… easier get vaccine. places aren’t NJ. Another sides moron. Non-American here. talk American work colleague know. get shot, get recorded national database? thought said no. giving someone card seems lazy, could forged, copied, lost...etc.. you? Ha. Gonna check out. Ty He's back now, played Lolla show Chicago. Also working new album together. Nice. Accuse person disagree selfish rather try listen saying. surely win people point view.

I think wise \*refuse\* local high risk population booster shots already infrastructure place get easily relatively cheaply. Roads biggest problem regarding distribution mRNA vaccines. Refrigerated shipping 100% consistent, large scale, long-term storage -60-80c much are. get away regular refrigerated temperatures 31 days, gives fairly small window opportunity actually get people's arms that's also storing last mile distribution.

So instead accusing selfish, maybe offer ideas solve refrigeration problem. perhaps think ship vaccines easier storage requirements countries? so, would using mRNA vaccines help local high risk population? big story spring images men cow dung. world. people aren’t scared anymore, labeled Spring Summer “low risk”, current willing venture out, wouldn’t surprised behavior playing role. 

Cases always gonna go degree majority people stopped “staying home much possible”, necessarily unexpected.

The main people still hunkering point two groups: a) parents kids 12, b)immunocompromised people people immunocompromised relatives household. Giving others freedom harms despite lack ""freedom to"" absolutely baffles governments companies STILL PREPARED respond pandemic living last 20 months. said worse last year.

I appreciate optimism, cannot deny reality. N95 KN95-related government policy exceed recommendation level.

If hypothetically speaking, sorts masks deemed valid, everybody acted like good folks followed mandate unanimously, would make big difference? Yes, doubt that. However, since we're enough trouble enforcing compliance regular mask mandates, N95 KN95 mandate going definitely even worse.  sound like rush, would schedule appointment. opening tomorrow great, get with. pneumonia treated like nothing really have. got worse instead getting better. prior point, pneumonia nothing get over, couple days' rest bed fine think anything it. talked well another day, it'll start getting better. day, well it'll get better eventually. worst enemy, gone little winded walking stairs, sign right something seriously wrong.

As 5-11 approval, FDA already said getting EUA science support instead get approved full approval vaccine, likely later year.

I realize emotional topic situation children needs put perspective. 349 children total died Covid since pandemic started. 349 633,000 total deaths.  That's less 0.06% deaths despite children making around 20% population. study done last August showed ZERO child deaths point someone without significant co-morbidity, two common leukemia obesity. matter nice though, new variants bypass vaccines completely develop poorer nations specifically west care rest world would suffer. he's calling charity, preventative measure cover ass long term. Two shots enough almost completely rule death enough.

Antivaxers way normalcy, pass sanitaire necessary keep put public space (i.e hospitals) it. 

Sincerly 75% population. Americans weird relationship word, im aware.  Gainesville. students wear masks campus.

I'm honestly surprised assaulted yet. honestly surprised people moving Florida droves.   less 1% population. Source every anecdotal report people it. made claim first. Show study, delta breakthroughs, indicating get sniffles. We. even get people wear something mouths. Good luck trying get control them. wish could get son vaccinated school starts. He's 11 1/2 taller adults. Yet, spend half school year unvaccinated delta spreads. Want search internet you? analysis change quickly, better prepared it. Delta changed lot analyses example. 6, 2021 | Updated: Aug. 7, 2021 2:08 p.m. 
  fourth wave pandemic probably peak Bay Area late month early next, quickly drop September, almost certainly come close causing deadly chaos last winter’s surge. That’s health experts’ best guess, based local national models take account now-dominant delta variant raged countries well vaccines holding it. 
  experts predict peak could arrive couple weeks. Others grim: One San Francisco model suggests surge could peak Sept. 3 336 people hospitalized COVID-19 city — almost 100 patients worst day winter surge — 237 additional deaths. even variables well defined, infectious disease models reliable weather forecasts, say aren’t great looking beyond week two. many variables remain poorly understood delta. 
    critical containing virus finding way coexist — remains unchallenged. variant infectious delta, probably won’t enough stamp COVID-19 entirely. That’s tough lesson past weeks across Bay Area, vaccination rates higher parts country many people assumed would prevent, sharply curtail, another surge. 
  irony surge perhaps best proof yet vaccines holding strong worst outcomes COVID, preventing severe disease leads hospitalization death. That’s summer shouldn’t deadly earlier waves. mean Bay Area make wave — ones almost certainly follow fall winter — far less economic social impact before. 
  surge also demonstrates coronavirus won’t easily shaken off. “The goalposts changed,” said Stephen Shortell, former dean UC Berkeley School Public Health. “We thought 10-yard line it’s 30 yards. It’s frustrating, that’s reality.” 
  increased urgency get people vaccinated, led vaccine mandates. Multiple cities counties California requiring government workers vaccinated — places risk losing jobs. Thursday, state ordered health care workers settings vaccinated end September. Many businesses also ordering employees, cases customers, get week, eight nine Bay Area counties issued new mask mandates everyone, regardless vaccination status, large part due risk transmission vaccinated. That’s reasonable, many health experts said, even acknowledged like many aspects pandemic, post-vaccination transmission still poorly understood, it’s clear much it’s contributing delta taught us know today useful decision-making today, things change quickly,” said Dr. Robert Wachter, chair department medicine UCSF. “Six weeks ago, thought sitting pretty. And, within course month, delta went blip dominant virus country, came understand came realize different two-thirds Bay Area residents fully vaccinated, though rates vary among counties — low 50% Solano 75% Marin. puts region well overall vaccination rates state country, 54% 50%, despite generally high vaccination rates, Bay Area hit hard delta since reopening June 15. Cases climbed far faster higher predicted. region surpassed last summer’s surge cases hospitalizations. 800 people hospitalized nine-county region Friday — fourfold increase since July saw predictions month ago state suggesting hospitals would peak similar last summer,” said Dr. Chris Farnitano, Contra Costa County health officer. “Well, last summer 110 patients hospital (in Contra Costa County), last week we’ve 140, 150. already blew summer surge numbers we’re still experts like Farnitano hoped even cases increased state reopened, high vaccination rates would translate far fewer hospitalizations — refer “decoupling” cases hospitalizations deaths. far hasn’t case hospital Francisco’s hospital forecast especially concerning. Dr. Grant Colfax, director Department Public Health, said 336-patient prediction assumes vaccination rates don’t increase, doesn’t factor new mask mandate measures people might take protect themselves. also assumes delta variant causes serious disease, still plausible scenario given reasonable scientific assumptions. it’s inevitable,” Colfax said. 
     projection comes fruition, “we’re much better place last winter,” Colfax said, noting models last December predicted San Francisco could well 1,000 people hospitalized once; actual peak 259. “Hundreds hospitalizations prevented hundreds lives saved vaccines,” said. 
  hopeful signs community-level immunity protective. Fully vaccinated people, though may infected delta higher rates previously expected, rarely hospitalized even less likely die. “What would really worry would surge hospitalizations immunized,” said Dr. Steven Goodman, Stanford epidemiologist. “That would indicate protection serious disease weakening.” 
  stands, people vaccinated make 80% 95% hospitalizations throughout California. Fully vaccinated people end hospital almost always age 80 one underlying health problem. 
  patients hospitalized tend younger healthier received hospital care earlier pandemic. Farnitano said slightly lower percentage hospitalized patients ending intensive care — 20% now, compared 25% 35% last summer winter. 
  far, COVID deaths climbing nearly pace cases hospitalizations, experts believe continue. Currently, Bay Area reporting five COVID deaths day — fifth last summer’s peak, less tenth winter peak. 
  surge unsettling, important reasons hope, many health experts said. notably, least Bay Area current situation proving enough people vaccinated it’s possible resume near-normal activities without causing widespread severe illness death. 
  hospitalizations may surpassed last summer — last summer everyone wearing masks, indoors out, months, businesses still largely operating capacity limits. Large gatherings banned. Fans weren’t allowed baseball games concerts forbidden. People navigating small social bubbles didn’t know they’d next get hug grandparents at-risk loved ones. 
  though mask mandates back many people feeling timid around crowds, absolute restrictions. state largely open since June 15, one’s talking locking again. Reopening schools full-time, in-person education become priority, experts don’t anticipate district-wide shutdowns previous 18 months, though schools may experience temporary closures outbreaks occur. 
  current Bay Area surge end next four six weeks due natural course virus — delta particular tended spike fast, drop quickly countries. Experts hope uptick vaccinations people cautious — wearing masks avoiding large gatherings — speed process. 
  what’s happened summer “should make us realize future waves close vaccination gap,” said Dr. Abraar Karan, infectious disease expert Stanford. “And even then, may need tap defenses like masks intermittently.” 
  fall winter present new challenges, could another surge end year. Children back school college students back campus. Flu season arrive, cold weather drive people indoors people gather major holidays. 
  immunity may waning then, — yet another variable scientists trying understand. could another new variant contend with. 
  said though he’s dark moments, also appreciate much better everyone year ago.

I’m sure that’s true anti covid vaxxers large numbers. It’s mostly rural white people urban minorities. Well, certainly advice experts.

Imagine far gone even listen health advice doctors virologists. think mandate masks vaccinate kids. don’t understand common sense would hill die on. Yes something SAVE life pfizered March, I'm asking question asked me, explaining personally believe true.   many “Don’t Fauci Florida” shirts sold ? wonder graphs comparable case rates. 

I wonder whats mortality rate buyers year  Well I’m gonna answer indivually solved shot we’ve already invented yes give fuck. lost sense taste Friday bad flu-like symptoms left work soon realized might covid.  I've fully vaccinated months now. 

I got tested Saturday morning soon could self-isolating continue test results. 

I thought COVID supposed dry? sneezing, runny nose, dry bad cough?  

This started typical colds flus started getting flu shots years ago. First seemed like bad allergies--sneezing/runny nose, morphed sinus infection (sputum discoloration), start getting flu-like symptoms (body aches, malaise). time, worse. Night sweats, fever dreams, weird pains. 

And soon up, bam, loss taste. 

I'm pretty much expecting positive test Sunday/Monday. Work guidelines I'll touch them, wondering seems like potential COVID infection like everything I've ever heard previous COVID infections. maybe coinfection headcold weakened immune system making susceptible COVID?    Chapter 666 Nobody's fucking going door door going door door. What's going happen they're going get vaccinated fired.

Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, SAIC, etc design weapons. contract support projects staff technical positions. I've done work three contractor base. strange base that's staffed military personnel. I've never heard place. stocks Commissary shelves? civilians working base contractors GS positions required vaccinated get tested regularly. None people going roll places employment start shooting. they'll get put down.  source close claiming decided run again. forget though. Saw news yesterday. someone received J&amp;J shot April, thought this…

Then walked nearest Costco it.

I completely trust Janssen jab alone would kept hospital. 95+% chance that. totally believe one shot alone would kept odds testing positive 1/3. great, it’s mild fully asymptomatic, that’s fine me.

However, LOT outcomes quick, mild infection hospitalization. virus break J&amp;J vaccine cause heart damage? Brain fog? Lung scarring? There’s enough data know. one could tell whether one-shot vaccine, quickest one could get, one travelled 30 miles away wait four-hour line could protect outcomes. 

So got shot Moderna.

Had sore arm swollen lymph node armpit days. 

I don’t feel great did, least know could protect health time/place vaccines plentiful consequences breakthrough infection uncertain.  comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

India claimed 60% population showing antibodies back Jan-Feb Delta reinfected everyone. People treat FDA approval like it’s God. all-knowing correct entity. It’s not. I’m sick person can’t even count number non-FDA approved blood tests guided treatment. Almost Mayo Clinic.  point there’s nothing say won’t get banned. county 15 percent vaccination rate. local clinic trying bribe folks Chick-fil-A gift cards today, already thinking getting booster since garbage immune system. 🤔 god's will, nothing gone wrong here. amen School district California son everything TK learning experience eight-ten kids class desks socially distance ninja masks required. HIPAA filters every class. would use Ford's models. Escape variant, Focus variant.... anyone fully vaccinated gotten covid anyway experienced lot SNEEZING? woke morning mildly scratchy throat, runny nose, sneezing like crazy. Normally would say allergies took allegra didn’t help. everything I’ve read online says sneezing common symptom all? Cant get testing appointment days. Hope it’s mild cold. hated fiddling loose cloth masks. KN95's fit great wear extended periods without fuss. Black person :) answer question actually yes. Many people anti-vax also *very* hesitant certain medical treatments. I’ve observed, hesitant elderly, uneducated middle aged, young people close them. However, hesitancy isn’t ideological- talked it, slowly surely. Unlike many white anti-vaxxers, they’re unlikely done “research” fully immersed misinformation, skepticism hint it. think churches getting board community leaders (locals, big names) helpful. I’ve peeled family antivax bandwagon sharing basic facts guinea pig. I’ve found helpful share vaccine ingredients (the elderly example bewildered readily available read), actually works, research covid vaccines largely already existed isn’t new experiment. Apophes, Wormwood, … basically infantilize entire races people. long critical mass herd immunity.... Yeah. Bad news ""willful"" anti-vaxxers, though, there's much room consider medically unable vaccinated.

Honestly, point, I'm comfortable claiming willful anti-vaxxers manslaughterers, indirectly responsible thousands unnecessary deaths. Legal punishments come that, side-eyes general ostracism fine me.  think loved ones get long Covid lose someone, start think little harder lies let believe, come conclusion politicians lie, though sort epiphany already know level.

I think already happening households across country. worst suffering generation parents' generation around Christmas last year. election.

I think facts statistics sway anyone either party. Stories examples do. understand issue way brings home. suspect lot people looking accountability 2022 beyond. someone opportunity get vaccinated, chooses to, dies covid… sympathy. 100% fault, deserve choosing endanger lives others. Nah they'll go back ""99.9% survival rate"" argument. Someone comment sourced vaccines administered 4.4bil times (financial times). 

If that’s good enough someone, nothing be. I’m pretty sure medication ever tested 2.2 bil+ individuals before. One day sick day. Problem solved. They've 6 months figure out.  normal guys start early? year different usually school Texas would start 16th.

Though, even year start 12. ( graduated uni starts 23rd, yay deal much nonvaxxed people) BinaxNOW $23, includes two tests. $11.50 test (before tax). Almost there. I'm Midwest suburb, seen every pharmacy go to. lol sweet summer child study found vaccine less effective (78% symptomatic infection) Mesa County, Delta variant widespread, compared counties (89% effective) Delta variant may prevalent yet. I'm concerned general practitioners researchers. E.g. person goes Doctor feeling terrible vaccine. Could bad luck, actual side effect. reported GP. Social distancing come back (at least USA) hurts economy way masking due capacity limits things like events, restaurants, etc. I’m BIPOC you’re basically correct. infantilizing argument implicitly racist. Particularly said demographic ‘*never*’ fault. That’s less implying diminished inferior mental intellectual capacity… 90% now? ain't gonna happen... That's point I'm going assess personal risk live life. False. Even get days off. limousine liberal would think otherwise due knowing others live. Healthy people dying vaccine. dad high blood pressure too, heart problems, prostate cancer two years ago. Took doses like nothing, even without secondary effects.

An aunt diabetes obesity got shots got infected mont. Without vaccine would death recovered fine.

Vaccines save lives, please take shot 🙏🏽 C-O-V-I-D, want see! GOOOOO COVID. 

/s What's latest long covid young children? i'm actually going give legitimacy. can't vouch physicians documenting information. major health systems systems place that. even twenty years ago, fastest way receive medical care part research study. question many physicians think lagging compared staying connected? question volume. every single thing needs reported get idea whats going on. would venture say impossibility get information correct, great pool draw on. 

and true medications pulled regularly. time goes on, learn more. going take couple years, may take decades really understand.

that said, may take decades truly understand damage covid causes. morbidly interesting. reviewed information nothing little risk analysis. determination one orders magnitude less risky other.

on note, nothing 100% safe 100% effective. always outliers. ~~can't~~ refuse see 65th square, run serious problems... baby thrown bathwater, information becomes propaganda, people start spouting lines favorite pundits middle school boys listening rappers. people die. struggle availability. got Sinovac May, months trying find open slot. job supposed provide shots, registrations opened April lot coworkers couldn’t get 1st dose till last month. still haven’t gotten 1st dose. youre saying anyi vaxxers werenfewer numbers would ok anti vaxxer? mean, *is* historical precedence God telling everyone stay inside s/he sending plague, according bible. 71% world wide? Symptoms last single day maximum. Get shot Saturday rest Sunday. Nobody America works 7 days week every single week zero sick days, even poorest people country. terrible excuse valid even slightly.

Suggestions? CDC data also show recent vaccinations reaching larger shares Hispanic, Asian, Black populations compared overall vaccinations. Twenty-six percent vaccines administered past 14 days gone Hispanic people, 4% Asian people, 15% Black people (Figure 1). recent patterns suggest narrowing racial gaps vaccinations national level, particularly Hispanic Black people, account larger share recent vaccinations compared share total population (26% vs. 17% 15% vs. 12%, respectively). data provide helpful insights national level, date, CDC publicly reporting state-level data racial/ethnic composition people vaccinated.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* brain dead others wrong side 19% recent documented COVID-19 cases California breakthroughs, state data shows fully vaccinated account increasing portion positive tests.
The number, contradicts repeated public portrayal breakthrough cases negligible, easily misinterpreted. clear, indication sort vaccine failure. Quite contrary.

Breakthrough cases expected. State data still suggests unvaccinated people nearly five times likely infected inoculated. almost hospitalizations deaths among unvaccinated people. Vaccines remain important tool fighting pandemic.
Rather, rising proportion breakthrough cases suggests even people vaccinated potentially significant spreaders coronavirus, especially delta variant. reinforces vaccinated people also wear masks public settings.

Breakthrough case rates sensitive topic, one health officials trying avoid sparked lot handwringing media report it.

The fear misinterpretation numbers dissuade people getting vaccinated. But, without data, important push everyone wear masks weakened.

Although vaccinated people well-protected serious illness, can, infected even they’re showing symptoms, spread virus others. Indeed, people breakthrough infections delta variant might contagious unvaccinated people, although science continues evolving point.

The call vaccinated people masks protection. “It’s you, it’s everybody,” says Contra Costa County Health Officer Chris Farnitano. “It’s keeping cases down.”

But, make point, it’s critical supporting data.

Unfortunately, U.S. Centers Disease Control Prevention stopped tracking breakthrough cases May 1, focusing patients hospitalized die. thinking apparently risk transmission breakthrough cases negligible. know, delta variant, that’s longer case.

This past week, much media attention misleadingly focused Kaiser Family Foundation survey breakthrough data 24 states tracking breakthrough cases. found cumulative infection rate vaccinated people since start year well 1% reporting states. Thus, narrative downplayed breakthrough cases.

But cumulative 2021 data helpful information confronting current surge driven relatively new delta variant. daily breakthrough case rates important.
To credit, California many county health officials tracking new COVID-19 cases cross-checking state vaccination lists determine infection rates vaccinated unvaccinated.

Thus, week July 31, statewide average daily rate vaccinated people 7 per 100,000, double two weeks earlier, unvaccinated 33 per 100,000.

But, amazingly, state health officials won’t say portion new cases involve vaccinated people. It’s rocket science. know portion population vaccinated. numbers state already released, rest calculation simple math.

Officials Santa Clara, Alameda Contra Costa counties, track data jurisdictions, confirmed calculations provided own. state, three days past week, refused either.

In Contra Costa County, seven-day average July 28 showed 23% new cases breakthroughs fully vaccinated people. Santa Clara County time period, portion 16%. Alameda County estimates 19% new cases month July breakthroughs. And, math, portion California 19% July 31, 15% two weeks earlier.

State officials note correctly portion breakthrough cases would expected increase people getting vaccinated. increase outpacing rate newly vaccinated.
To sure, data, like COVID-19 case data have, limited relies test results. Thus, probably underrepresents breakthrough cases infected vaccinated people likely unvaccinated asymptomatic consequently less likely seek testing.
Randomized testing needed understand prevalence breakthrough cases accurately. surpassed 10,000 daily cases California, it’s longer insignificant roughly one five already completed shots.

Maybe wanted sent Ireland Oh, dear. mother kids who’ve pneumonia freaking common cold, would rather risked AZ delta variant. must frightening time lot people. agree education system needs serious changes educated, run ""successful"" business, hold Phd still little empathy. massive social/cultural structure issues contributing behavior. Education part puzzle, yes, sadly lot pieces need work well. I’m testing don’t quarantine another week work it’s positive case. job WFH difficult since I’m on-site support need get back on-site.

So health life probably OK since vaccinated, quality life dinged this. need wrap up. Endorsing political candidates (Biden) obvious agenda, Scientific American went actual science political garbage. reliable sources providing COVID statistics based vaccination status?

If huge uptick positive cases people UNvaccinated, I'm going continue give fuck. not, people vaccinated getting COVID, that's huge issue. least husband get divorce find real wife next time Thank clarifying this. 

Can make rule even going misleading title like put details description immediately something like that? That’s fan base, Ole Miss’s. Trauma response rarely based logic. fault they're apprehensive. sucks want everyone vaxxed, fear deep go away. Why? church keep people getting vaccinated? Sounds like idiots met consequences poor choices. interested, there's detailed data Italy. think comprehensive dashboard I've seen country, bad italian fairly obscure/not publicized.

As well vaccines, sections ton data cases, ICU admissions etc, often available region well.  Lol. Try sometime. sound like pent up. Release evil government body!! rock! employer tried ""back office collaborating"" bullshit. proven focused productive home putting unwelcomed chatter interruptions office. need Collab anyone get job done. managers work remotely well many engineering teams. one figure want worker bees back office setting. maddening. true! It’s unfortunate underpaid worked teachers are. really, really need focus education more. Exactly this. people posting month ago saying pandemic fully vaccinated spreading virus. Despite reply got here, saw infectious disease doctor news show past couple days argue similar saying:

That normally, would argue vaccinating rest world first, US particular, large number vaccinated unvaccinated people around other, undergoing rampant spread virus mitigation measures place, perfect breeding ground ground vaccine-resistant variant, selective pressure *does exist* virus situation, let happen new strain became widespread, much effort put vaccinating rest world would naught.

Hopefully first second shot rates continue increase US that's something balance somewhat near future, hopefully, maybe. go trouble face stiff consequences vaccine literally free? 26% number meaningless. See posts why. LOL, yes.

and pandemic taught us people selfish...

'nuff said Yeah, don’t teach... whatever... school?

The answer always good job teaching math well. need smaller classrooms. That’s it. whole education system almost fixes classrooms smaller classrooms.  Well, US ""America"", EU ""Europe"". Yes, thank you, I'll edit. Yep pick pack 7 lateral flow tests free charge pharmacies UK. need later, go back pick more. Looking cheap bike month so.  Maybe. I’m hoping if-and-when recommend boosters, enough people already gotten unauthorized ones guidance us. it’s going paperwork issue won’t considered fully vaccinated without official booster, I’ll get third shot. I’m state giving third shots without craziness. walked asked pharmacy put line gave jab signed card. original two Pfizer pharmacy told advised give third whatever first two mix doses Pfizer Moderna. probably want stay mRNA boosters ignore J&amp;J boosters, aren’t sure talk doctor pharmacist.  Covid+Rabbies=Time zombie apocalypse 😂 numbers OP posted insanely misleading. source says 20% died tracking people went hospital got tested. understand acceptance point. I'm personally impacted anti-vaxers, know many people personally impacted. hospitals available unvaccinated family 30 people likely going able handle surge area. kids normal life yet. So, yeah, may acceptance parts I'm still thick it. Alpha nothing compared Delta, family underlying conditions anti-mask live place 35% vaccination rate may leave family wake grief, financial difficulty never recover from. Further, what's actually infuriating people take healthcare workers granted, always won't. Nurses quitting.
You stay acceptance mode stress healthy. Squeeze much joy short life. Pastor saw revenue dropping. comes comments butthurt westerners can't conceive non first world country things better calling DeSantis resign. single-handedly responsible devastating wave been. done criminal. That‘s legitimate question. think certainty comes recent publications efficacy. recent study Pfizer/Biontech 40,000 people shows efficacy decreases time, high initially decreases average 6 % every two months. UK also great monitoring system, publish vaccine updates every week confirm efficacy still good. know Canada also released data efficacy weeks ago found same. don‘t doubt say true, strongly suspect it‘s rare event. Yep. Barely two months ago making plans, bought concert tickets show November...what optimistic fool am. known better. attending show November. Fucking ridiculous idiots choosing get vaccinated endanger loved ones, prolong overall pandemic, possibly even incubate new variant undoes hard work went treatments vaccines past 1.5 years.   federal government needs mandate vaccines everyone. Line people national guard standing by. Anyone resists arrested forcibly vaccinated restrained. I’m absolutely fucking done this. Oh first shot got days ago? Stupidity reported spreading rapidly. last election 32,000 votes. perspective. go military, get lot vaccines including smallpox mandatory. suspect COVID added list soon too. want people die regardless whos fault it?  people still vote him. wouldn’t surprise first line get vaccinated.  Low probability events happen. greater population vaccines effective. I’m guessing family members ventilators ICU? would probably attributed protection vaccines.  world archives semblance heard immunity unfortunately  military, airlines, international travel. go door door people soon much fewer options workplaces require it. I'm baffled COVID tests still covered unvaccinated. 

It's fuckin lifetime event people would probably support insurance companies reducing coverage lol.  bible bs. individual's intense support still one vote.  Sounds like lot anxiety medical system could cause pass outs. putting real fear “unvaccinated assholes” start denying health coverage COVID-19 related treatment anti-vaxers?

Let take “personal responsibility” clamor let demonstrate like it. THANK YOU! people get that, unfortunately. Basically saying virus become endemic need take vaccines every year people still think means living post apocalyptic zombie plague. Go figure.  already! polio vaccine? requiring school employment somehow overstep well? cater selfish assholes. thinknof community individual. fastest way get people vaccinated would airlines mandate passengers show proof vaccination fly. people complain, bet really push people get vaccine. know hard think physically present school vaccinate.

this stuff hard talk without people antivaxx complex. may symptomless transmission among vaxxed even mentioned. rate could get jail prison vaccinated well. fuel conspiratorial side lack trust authorities leaders. Much lack trust unfortunately well deserved point. need turn around. Cringe Ooh, know, it’s keep scrolling google find rehosted geocities blog sells “unflitered full moon water” agrees you, right?

Either way, comparing airborne virus available vaccine someone HIV who, weird fantasy, willingly accepts help open wound someone protection. Even im case, Yes, sure.

Also, take at-home tests get PCR show up, vaxxed people think allergies.

I suspect though would true unvaxxed group? seeing numbers case rates vaccinated unvaccinated people quite similar. 

Of course, never quite presented full information, present situation half population fully vaccinated, pretty easy make estimates.

Obviously needs study ASAP.  hospitals filled (by large) unvaccinated people. feel healthcare workers, kids, immunocompromised. business requires mask going crowded area/in close contact people know, put one on. 

But end day, I'm vaccinated know protected. putting life hold longer year+ locking waiting vaccine. authority so? businesses Florida right refuse service? I'm familiar Florida law, find hard believe mandate private business decisions (requiring vaccines workers, proof vaccination customers). basically prefer devil know xx.xx% chance long covid ""mind fog"" whatever versus xx.xx% chance unknown.

heck, know odds developing turning incredible hulk whatever negative side effect think vaccine causes can't understand possible understood. Republicans act react, thoughtlessly. whole brand. Good point. takeaway vaccine best choice everyone, previously infected not.  Isn’t everyone got vaccine? vaccine hesitant simply afraid vaccine covid, covid worsening vaccine hasn’t issues, balance shifting afraid covid. want something feel better? something unwarranted causes problems?

Also, he's one prominent advocates keeping US schools closed indefinitely - yet moved family Europe fairly early pandemic kid could attend in-person school masks.  He's hypocrite.   Wasnt polio vaccine made fda existed stated day one get pass along, I'm still seeing articles breakthrough infection extremely rare (it's not), absolutely pushed vaccinated people would spreading virus. 
There's lot retroactive changes narrative past couple weeks. course pro-vaccine, got mine soon could, people saying info always vaccine going stop infection spread lie. something we've learning recently CDC still adapting messaging it. know ""It always like this"" types saying cope come on. Please quit justifying anything. Even Roe court held right privacy absolute, must balanced government's interests protecting women's health protecting prenatal life.

Here's another (and quite simpler site is…but common cold likely deadly, hasn’t economic incentive vaccine produced. future, Covid vaccine could perhaps two-fer knock cold covid season. Nope. Lol also didn’t address concerns commented on…. whole issue statement basis freedom; world described “freedom choose” freedom choose whatsoever. You’re commenting post regarding making mandated vaccines covid you’re taking account key ideas think creating legislation. include extreme cases thinking writing legislation creating laws else circumstances arise laws can’t dictate happen correctly. case isn’t cherry picking one idea, obligated think extreme circumstances laws would apply contexts. reason laws aren’t “Murder illegal” they’re 80+ page books potential circumstances apply law applies circumstance. poster aren’t “concerned” infringement freedom mandate implies either apparently, lack medical privacy implies employers access information, etc. say example employers require proof vaccination, autoimmune disorder prevents getting it. MUST disclose this, may illegal discriminate people autoimmune diseases may fall ill die easily others, it’s mind hiring managers company 100% influence decisions. It’s reason single mothers don’t willingly disclose potential employers. consider situations creating laws this, certainly feels like majority people aren’t that. Go ahead keep saying I’m cherry picking situations, family member ever find unique situation laws aren’t complete thorough end disadvantaged it, don’t complain. post exactly wish ignore feature real life. people opinions worth validating. It’s much illegal something goes wrong, you’re vulnerable position. almost enough make hope Trump runs 2024. think Trump live long he's unwell, run lose again. DeSantis I'm less sure about.

Boris Break day 2020 death count **whole country**? could wrong link glorious leader saying please?

Exactly!! Thank you. forced. math really difficult, site provided analysis months ago. 

i think there's lot reason think answer clear cut portray least starting point trying sort Jesus, days 2020 death count **whole country** keep saying: sake civilization vaccination mandatory people medically inappropriate, zero exceptions draconian penalties punishments failure comply. 

Your freedom ends point put people's lives jeopardy.  It’s probably vasovagal passing three times concerning I’d see doctor him.

But deal necessary serves greater good, foundation even functional society people debate enjoy rights.

Anyone who's raised kids would know sometimes make people things good. Anti-vaxxers are, mentally behaviorally, much different petty children, think. seeing display would hate live florida...

GTFO soon can. That's big difference right there, besides level anti-vaxxers think see quick drop cases like have. 

I feel like everyone lost damn minds. *Kids* getting hospitalized much higher numbers hardly anyone cares anymore.  get condition employment.

FWIW, know someone works employment attorney said they're getting slammed calls people whining possibly getting fired get vaccine. takes great pleasure telling ""well, yeah, employer that.""  next heavily mutated variant less likely get injured/ die seatbelt on. vaccine.   “Vaccine” qualifiers would work fine. Anything “lawful”. requires law makers make law. question be. government mandate medical procedure, outlaw medical procedures too. symptoms? know it?  Lol there's conspiracy comment, I'm talking human nature people good righteous preach are. also mentioned easy adopt ideological simplistic worldview that's used justify things.

What looks like maybe I've struck nerve you, name calling already evidence good claim. call names, trying discussion. even used latest ideological term ""conspiracy"", used dismiss, did. Textbook example. caught covid vaccinated? like? It’s going around kids daycare ear temp read 100.2.  See ya, morons is, whoever supports lose. It’s going cause spontaneous miscarriage en masse result you’re looking for. clear, US mandate vaccine condition using public (or private) services.

Wrong. apply EUAs. Different US Code. Right decline mandate proof vaccination condition attending public school.

Wrong again. differs state. many states completely opt vaccination program still attend public school. states back previous point. may case approved vaccines, EUAs.   we're looking roundabout ways violate people right make decisions make them.

And guys call Republicans authoritarian honestly hilarious 

Everyone right want basis country. I'm fully vaccinated, would support lockdown now? argument get vaccinated go back normal.

I'm willing risk tiny chance breakthrough infection even miniscule chance hospitalized vaccinated get back normal life. suffer forever dying choice easily prevent covid vaccinated yet continually chose risk lives? still explained they're going use 2nd Amendment rights get jobs back. we're talking mandates discussed article.

Calling idiot change that. Social media doubt shaped people's opinions climate change income equality. been? second dose information pretty hard come by. seems bit better, marginally. DoD whatever wants. Doesn’t change fact town comprised civilians. military service members keep economy afloat, hence mentioned them.  sounds horrible, sorry :( something else focus right now? Something keep mind busy while? I‘m sure family members receiving excellent care well-trained professionals. since vaccinated, chances really good. Even protection infection fails, vaccines second line defense: improving progression disease. Take time focus something else moment, it‘s easy get drawn frightening train thoughts Oh damn. 

I wonder many 32k six feet now? Yeah please remove Kentucky list. governor play southern games covid. Here's good summary findings, pg. 12 linked pdf first full school-year onset COVID-19 pandemic, enrollment U.S. public schools fell dramatically (i.e., decline 1.1 million students 2 percent prior K-12 enrollment). enrollment decline important leading indicator educational impact pandemic. particular, existence magnitude enrollment decline implies myriad potential consequences schools students. include likely fiscal strain public schools declining enrollment well diverse developmental implications students related underlying behaviors driving enrollment declines kindergarten skipping redshirting, school switching, truancy, dropping out. Arguably, major policy lever relevant enrollment decisions (and continues be) instructional mode states districts choose schools (i.e., in-person, remote-only, hybrid). fall 2020, policymakers confronted exceptionally difficult choice reopen schools; one required balance public-health risks students communities educational economic harm remote instruction. 
  study, rely several unique data sources construct quasi-experimental evidence fall 2020 reopening decisions influenced disenrollment phenomenon. results suggest decision offer remote-only instruction last fall contributed meaningfully disenrollment public schools. Specifically, estimates suggest offering remote-only instruction increased disenrollment 42 percent (i.e., change 2.6 3.7 percent) relative in-person instruction hybrid instruction small statistically insignificant effects. frame effect sizes national decline public school enrollment, note public schools previously enrolled roughly 49 million students roughly 57 percent students faced remote-only instruction November 2020 (Henderson, Peterson, West, 2021). additional enrollment decline remote-only districts (i.e., 1.1 percentage points) implies public schools lost roughly 300,000 K-12 students result decisions (i.e., 49 million ⨉ 0.57 ⨉ 0.011). implies widespread adoption remote-only instruction explains roughly quarter disenrollment public schools. Notably, also find evidence effects remote-only instruction decline public-school enrollment particularly concentrated kindergarten elementary school grades. great info  LOL...well, I'm psychic I'm pretty confident saying get vaccine chances dead 10 years significantly higher would otherwise. CDC page showing [admissions age (select Jurisdiction Age. pick Florida).

As see, things ramped - nurses docs wwho post regularly. ER/ICU folks seem ragged edge :( gave dad year 2 years died 8 months. What’s point? dumbest shit I’ve heard today. mean stage 4 lung cancer patients don’t exactly last long either. That’s tends go, nosedive. Lung mechanics, suppose so. fat cells biologically active give hormones interfere things. 

But I've honestly never looked sleep/ respiratory physiology huge body builders can't really comment intelligently patient group.   job government protect citizens. Yeah, OP clearly says skimmed lazy so.... that. Martha Washington terrified inoculation. told straight would able visit winter camp unless got it. realized patriotic duty position required get matter afraid was. got knew husband dead serious.  biggest problem IMO almost one gives shit long covid. did, could finally meaningful conversations ""taboo"" facts, would also 1) mean antivaxxers would stop antivaxx start everything power catch 2) vaxxed people would stop pretending life fully back normal safe vaxxed.

It's safe say unvaxxed-by-choice point never cared/imagined hospitalized covid, yet keep pushing great vaccines preventing hospitalization...on deaf ears.

Instead, could finally get messaging long covid, maybe everyone would start taking seriously. However, long covid also basically ""taboo subject"" among vaxxers, want think get shot ""the virus can't hurt you."" 

For record, doubly vaxxed eagerly awaiting booster. You’re fucking idiot. literally said vaccinated. Far read recently, 12.9 billion vaccines donated globally, maint problem exportation. said bunch strict rules bureaucracies may compromise part delivery jabs. Let's hope semester things turn better estimated. Last week State, 58% TOTAL population immunized.

Vaccinated cases: 467

Unvaccinated cases: 2169

Hospitalizations - vaccinated skew older sicker:

Vaccinated admissions: 123

Unvaccinated admissions: 17

Deaths:

Vaccinated: 10

Unvaccinated: 0 Okay. You’re clearly idiot. guess I’m done trying explain crazy people you. 

I’m currently restaurant bartender literally calling vaccine “socialism”. 

Just kill messenger. Okay man. I’m gonna go back forth you. I’m vaxxed, vote blue, live south. 

I’m telling people rockers keep asking “but how? why?” 

You’re either ideologically pure dumb cannot understand people irrational. two month business trip even require visa many countries - gets onerous long term immigrant visas allow live work. children thing that's protected? instance can't deny someone housing based baby. choice (in states). friend passes every time gets vaccine. always lay wherever gets vaccine. laid Walmart floor got Covid vaccine. friend needs booster would best get doctors office probably. Agreed Friend works lab Ohio said saw lambda.  Maybe miss recalled reported yet  also seems like Chicago hasn’t surge yet, long keep kinda events vaccine mandatory able “hot vax summer”.   point even largely unvaccinated ending ICU, *that's still lot people*. They're jamming hospitals, cascades affecting even vaccinated. 

That's mention allows breeding ground virus mutate maybe even strain actually defeat vaccine. what? 

It may come really clamp down. pleasant anyone.  understand pediatric Pfizer trial, investigating lower doses. 

BNT162b2 10mcg
BNT162b2 20mcg
BNT162b2 30mcg

30 mcg adult dose. means likely using concentration adults. use vials adults teenagers, get doses per vial (if lower dose shown optimal younger children). Ok, fine, let's dig little deeper that.

Why would another lockdown effective one already had?

How long lockdown last?

What evidence course action best?

Why would matter United States locks point Covid global, Delta variant even originate US?

I respect science. Science said vaccines effective, get vaccinated.

I'd like see evidence new lockdown scientifically proven effective, especially given we've already one failed contain Covid. need worry that, follow science. clear catastrophic breakthrough scenario many dreading.  I'm thinking next flu season going really bad strains since nobody wearing mask anymore. 

Whatever strains made going explode doubt they'll ones we're prepared like usual. Kids need quarantine can't attend daycares schools.  State governments, yes. Federal government, no. know least 20 people visited FL past month, half past week half.  good thing Japan hosting unnecessary event people world. Abbot fucking helping one bit...BIG surprise. Fucking crippled asshole. playing peoples lives. COVID, right dickhole. anybody keeping list high profile anti-van people dying , seems adding up?  antivax loonies claim hesitant lack FDA approval better get now…. that’s doubtful. always move goal post. government forcing get vaccine. would wrong. want share space strangers public lot places welcome go, especially indoor spaces. see problem COVID. future virus worried fabricated/made up, well shall cross bridge come it? Selfish crybabies keep crying matter deal consequences actions. I'm talking social media tug war. actual statistics.The reduced deaths \_are\_ positive thing bring discussion infection spread among vaccinated brought up...instead one side yelling ""Breakthroughs extremely rare!"" says ""Vaccines never supposed stop infection spread, nobody ever said were!"" know people say word boog? lay bed dream about.

Don't give good reason boog. Charlie Kirk post mistook 350m distributed doses 350m vaccinated americans     Lot poor minorities also trust vaccine surprisingly. do! Honestly, I’m going too. it’s good hypothesis I’m fairly sure *is* reason behind people’s general mistrust apprehension, **but** I’m also extremely confident I’m *also* right, people conflating non-drug consumer products FDA-approved medications. 

Have good weekend mate :) anyone confused title, COVAX vaccine. effort distribute vaccines countries less access. Freedom without responsibility immaturity. people mentally mature. act like big children. Ego. already 'picked team' stick matter wrong  wanna get fingerpointing data defs something worry whichever side on. Pretty sure, statistically, youngest still less risk vaccinated adults. Yes absolutely appears true. south typically deal summer months. Underrated comment 😂 Valuing input random strangers reddit actual doctors person seems foolish, wish best luck.  Literally cant get selfish that. can't blame them.  Darwinism used opposite, CDC backpedalled. Basically every state US ""at-will"" employment: certainly won’t vote him.

I vote island tho. Also, data specifically “typical” bed occupancy. I’ve seen, they’re type beg covid vaccine right they’re intubated. really, nether got tested anything get Visa (business trip 2 months USA) many people claimed got info friend works White House (aka saw fake screenshot everyone else claiming this) kids need schools cannot get vaccinated yet. propose try without coming budget infrastructure outdoor classrooms? Florida department health???

They give fuck health, let alone others. Visiting thread always fills dread Na na na na love state fuck wrong people it? mean technically everyone access vaccine 6 months. yet either kid, can't get pre existing conditions asshole. assholes want freedom virus let em it.  already vaccine mandate public school military. part either vaxxed. totally agree sentiment shouldn’t said this. fuel conspirators..:::   Yep here. mother, sister, brother refuse vaccine, wear masks, believe covid real solely get news telegram groups Facebook. went apeshit found 96 year old grandfather got vaccinated, tried convince get vaccinated well, sending dozens bogus “articles” videos hosted random websites. sister sure would die received second Pfizer dose 4 months ago. Fucking idiots hope get covid. Fuck people. It’s like patriot act. let pass fear terrorists it’s ultimately used spy us pass keep going it’s always going thing something made 21 years ago can’t give government inch never move back. It’s still mind boggling people aren’t held accountable misinformation.

The classic example hear “you can’t yell fire crowded movie theatre.”

But we’re gonna anything yelling hoax pandemic?

I get leaving social media crowd it, politicians whose jobs put constituents first? say want children murdered assault rifles. lot shorter.  Yes it’s interesting see talking point spun multiple people. example “illegals bringing virus” suddenly popped certain spaces Wear two masks get 4 vaccine shots obviously  Y'all understand saying

""Y’all understand saying “wow america stupid. fucked up” won’t change things right""

Won't change things right?  Replace government ""Democrat government"" correct. Republicans never shyed away imposing businesses individuals.

As seen Florida Texas. doesn’t Israeli U.K. data show opposite?  violates modern EUA thoughts prayers go man's family anyone voluntarily vaccinated. Bless hearts! I'm prayin' y'all!! actually think roughly 96.5% Americans public school?????????? Maybe hack fact vaccinated age group?  wouldn’t call 200,000 100 million “exploded”.

“The vaccine preforming intended purpose”

Where said vaccinated wont get Covid? get Covid vaccinated never go hospital. wanted say impressed civil discussion thread is. sensitive topic and, part, everyone appears sharing view receptive others input. Seriously, far impressive way humanity portrayed lately. discussion awesome. clickbait.  Roe holds state legitimate interest fetal life prior first trimester justify violating right privacy woman. afterwards does. Preventing spread contagious disease could legitimate interest perfectly fine Roe.  According republicans, businesses, states right whatever want long want aligns republican ideals. Otherwise obviously government mandate republican ideals others prevent companies exercising non republican ideals. gods plan  Thanks cogent response.  Oh honey, lol free country... never lived free country. Bless heart. Fox acting like illegal immigration causing spike... know ask? Well, father seems love DeSantis told political hit job actually illegals shipped Florida Texas. think hurt feelings laughed said this. It’s DeSantis variant I'm talking %. Saying effects children severely % raw numbers. Yes, absolutely agree raw number children hospitalized likely greater alpha variants mean severe. severe means larger % end worse outcomes before. debating larger chance infection larger R value equal severe children. *dis gon gud* signed law stating Cruise lines refuse people vaccinated.



Many Cruise lines want limit access vaccinated people. people take cruises want vaccinated cruises


MoRon one fighting that. age brackets vaccination drug dosing based things, size/weight actually important. Infants, children, adolescents differing metabolism rates well differing immune system responses, can't treat mini adults (or treat babies mini kids).

These studies designed target, school demographics factor design   changes DOEd wills evidence breakthrough Covid case lead death? people unironically want  Ok made plan. What's evidence work? American kids, yes anything recent? article May last year. Fuck, needed think outside box.    Ahaha wasn’t directed them. It’s measure bad delta is. 

They’re worried enough operations they’re taking steps. actually kinda scary bc obviously don’t care employees warehouses - that’s given.  I'm going plane October. best mask buy protected? US.   That’s really shitty considering wouldn’t recognize original shots. Delta something fuck around with. older ~~50~~ **12** vaccinated preexisting conditions immunocompromised encourage get vaccinated ASAP delta get die.

FTFY (and yes, understand much less likely, *can* *does* happen. reason get shot.) “We hold truths self-evident, men created equal, endowed Creator certain unalienable Rights, among Life, Liberty pursuit Happiness.” No, rights given government. train thought, you’d better living different country USA. I’m MN… don’t think chicken pox vaccine id mandated schools here?

I don’t disagree though- would like mandate covid vaccine wherever possible. people don’t want it, let stay home work, school, public places &amp; leave living rest us.  public health perspective actually worst case scenario post vaccine world. wait flu season. worse.😥 We’re learning right now, real time, vaccinations primarily protect individual severe illness general transmission. 

With knowledge, can’t bothered try stem transmission risks protect young infirm arguably deserve anger groups caretakers. you’re going selfish, results it.    re-read PDF above. According that, hospitalization rate hasn’t 1% since December 2020. 

It seems like rates based cumulative numbers though, react slowly spikes hospitalizations. Vote sewage human Blame someone else using war authorization act manufacture lot oxygen needed. argument lacks common sense. Refusing vaccination personal matter, people right public safety. certainly possibility new strain likely going happen. mental health take refuge right safe. Enjoy small wins. 50 make 5% deaths far. 30,000 people. percentage increase people 50 get vaccinated.


And death common thing worry about.


Besides wants get sick, possibly pass friends, family, coworkers, etc... title little misleading. news page, second death chart, see 12 deaths Aug 7. 10 new cases 12 deaths unbalanced numbers, sign either under-testing undetected outbreak(like saw WA's nursing home last Feb). Didn’t take insult certainly condescending. Enjoy day. Bye evidence is... Pfizer vaccine possibly linked 10 deaths elderly extremely frail? suppressing anything? Lmao  Everyday  knowingly give 3rd. Oh, simple. 10 day 2 week lockdown. tell everyone 4 days prepare (no run toilet paper). would let current infectious round stall, new infections. rocket science - well, unless politician fact everyone thinks would lose exactly would win. could 2016 again.   Oh please. You’re mandated million things every day without question ONE thing actually bigger individual freedoms (and thus arguably important) bridge far?

This means vaccines showing efficacy 79%. That's really good. think never read articles? statement self-contradictory. 

If poll showing vaccinated worried covid, would imply also better taking precautions covid hence smaller rate infections even without vaccine. This, turn, would make information breakthrough infections even important.

The number need vaccinated increases strain gets transmissible.

The ancestral strain R0 around 3. Lacking changes behavior, need 67% population immune herd immunity even causes number cases start dropping rather increasing.

Delta strain estimated R0 5-8. may need much 88% population immune cases start dropping instead increasing. percent population needs vaccinated also increases based effective vaccine preventing transmission, never everyone comply seems strange

That's idea behind mandate. Make easy possible completely free get vaccine, spread much education possible minimize hesitancy; also make difficult expensive go life without vaccinated, enough overcome hesitancy remains. hit 100% people? course not, definitely gotta get better 80%. It’s nice breath fresh air around here, things read concerning.

I’m 15. everyone family vaxxed up, went beach first time years last week. great escape, it’s first sign life coming back us.

We live highly vaccinated state Northeast, soon wave ends hope lift final restrictions assuming safe so. really don’t want lose another year high school. free, couple months walk ins available. 15 minutes out. really excuse point.  Whole long discussion daily stormer emigres pretending care black vaccination rates. (rightly) assume people currently vaxxed, could be, change minds affects someone close, think (sadly) spot on. exactly ""breakthrough"" ? 

How many vaccinated breakthroughs result serious illness versus typical seasonal flu symptoms? Maybe Trump told repub conspiracy theorist follower take Covfefe vaccine would change heart? best I've seen Pierce: FDA needs approve shit already, getting real old.  right now, classes person starting two weeks tomorrow. reinstated mask mandate, including vaccinated people. old you? Lol satisfied getting information headlines big problem misinformation today  necessarily. takes one outbreak. Yeah, bad strain flu.

Symptoms bad cough, ripping sore throat, headache, stuffed nose, bad fever sweats, exhaustion like I’ve never felt life. Standing get tea kitchen needed three-hour nap afterward. summer wear three sweaters outside. two weeks lingering cough three months.

So yeah, quite bad. Unfortunately, qualifies “mild” Covid, I’m watching closely see “most vaccinated breakthrough infections mild!” really means. isn’t mixed messaging. takes actually paying attention saying. get sick vaccinated (which LESS likely) spread easily unvaccinated. It’s hard understand, CDC media able give facts like transmissibility without people black white going “then vaccines?!” It’s like people say “if masks work, vaccines?” It’s child-like levels critical thinking. appreciate civility. I’m sorry respect point view. don’t hate wish ill will. SRNE (probably?) say jest, knew guy said this, something something insurance. normally never buckled up, like ""being told do"".  choice effects me, family, friends,

Hopefully didn’t get vaccines well kid, actually put virus you. 

MRNA vaccines body less 48 hours. make body immune response, nothing nothing less. 

If end hospital covid, hope refuse drugs care. They’re emergency approved label use COVID, WAY toxic risk drugs vaccine. 

Bet bet you’d never that. It’s shame see people like selfish, good luck! It’s “a warzone” don’t people know delta variant far less dangerous? realize matter anyone else Internet says many others like.

However, would make recommendation, speak Primary Care Physician concerns may vaccine, maybe research make decision.

See easy choice hate sick anything fully prevent getting sick entirely least lesson severity duration for.

Added high faith Western Medicine, research vaccines finally spoke PCP vaccines. case take medication could theory make vaccine less effective, encouraged conversation specialist prescribes medication specialist's guidance modified medication period time vaccination ensure worked best could. 

Plus, litigious nature, fact cannot sue manufacturers bother me.

As said realize people change mind folks Internet really going effect.

Edited add thought difference 4 5 pretty small considering factors, regional restrictions, testing capabilities errors. Point it, many times smaller.  Everyone sighting Kentucky study. also shown previous infection, itself, equal someone prior infection 2 doses vaccine. So, yes helps get vaccine even prior infection squire super immunity, per say. CDC level people.  One best friends runs samples covid tests Tampa general. texted said 4 cases delta currently hospital.  Meaning 81% aren’t.

Simple stats say vax rate goes up, cases vaxed due fact vaccine isn’t foolproof, vaccinated majority CA. 

What looking new cases. Places low vax rates preventative measures like Florida/Alabama/Mississippi new case graphs look like straight line. Places like California high vax rate decently strong preventative measures much subdued line. Yeah im done responding. clearly shown decision informed intention getting informed discussions people dedicated lives medicine, would rather make decision yourself

I hope stay safe, enjoy ""freedom"" hoping Dr. Seuss characters, ok. Meanwhile, Dave Blake projected peak August 12th, give take days Missouri showing signs peaking case rates going levels 1.3 range, track cases peak nationwide Labor current wave over, case/fatality ratio go level flu, death rate 20 times lower combo vaccination natural infection. source that? Curious haven’t seen all.    Yes, major takeaway graph kff link this: group appears show vaccine uptake near percentage overall population, i.e. blacks 12%, minus ~-1%, hispanics 17%, close dead recall, whites 61%, minus ~6-7%, groups dead population percentages Asian Americans. 
The takeaway whole country getting vaccinated nearly enough delta variant potentially massive R0 spreading like wildfire. Whites definitely lagging whole country needs vaccine mandate. fat makes everything difficult. definitely makes covid deadly. good sign countries high vaccination rate Really depends where. I've pubs NOBODY masked. bar service back. I'd say people thing really. avoid crowds. go gigs. personally adjust behaviour according whether ""essential"" place I'm (like shop) (like pub).

Enjoy never living normal life. probably fired barred going outside places restricted working remotely rest life. also kill around you, I'm glad fine that. Booster different completely switching vaccines. Make will. Best bet get vaccinated almost eliminates risk dying worth noting Western vaccines far produce antibodies spike protein whereas natural infection produce kinds antibodies. seem help third study reference shows Coronavac, whole virion vaccine produce types antibodies, performs better predicted whilst vaccines perform worse predicted. Viral load roughly 1,000 times higher people infected Delta variant infected original coronavirus strain. confirmed outdoor transmissions without sustained close contact. Spend time looking mask efficacy data online may conclude none exists. reasonable conclusion mask efficacy results low fit current narrative, aka can't handle truth. One time : STAY HOME. hope people get serious Covid start asking Florida, higher percentage people vaccinated half states country, surge. Oregon, higher vaccinated percentage Florida, similar surge. 

Hint.. governor. Covid clearly care governor is. saw last fall states without mask mandates similar spikes. we'll see thing again. 

But alas, everyone wants oversimplify overpolitify prove much smarter are.   Let professionals guide correct decision put healthy body order avoid virus would probably survive anyway? That's thinking. exactly ok playing trick get shot, again, sizable number anti-vaxxers want shot states throw vaccines past use date. judge someone wants booster shot, especially chronic preexisting condition? anti-vaxxers trying best incubate enough variants run greek alphabet, even see action preemptive self-defense. know legalese know high school like 70% vaccination. 30% exemptions, mostly personal medical. might claim religious reasons I'm sure. vaccines definitely fully required.

We already know vaccinated people still spread COVID-19. lockdown everyone right? leaving house! there's risk everywhere. ""You're rights end mine begin,"" okayyy better get within 19 feet me! safer 6. better double mask well, never drink alcohol. We're drawing lines sand dude. Safety solid line, metric. improving safety requires sacrificing freedoms, I'm out.

Yeah I'm semi-anarchist. We're gonna convince anything. that's alright. WHATABOUT WHATABOUT WHATABOUT WHATABOUT able get tested free thru Walgreens CVS, tests available easy schedule online even don’t care ending pandemic?

Over 100 million actual excess doses donated US dime, continue donated. Covax failure doses bought- there's enough physical infrastructure produce them. literally Canada problem months ago. US warned suggested supply chains set low income countries ignored. mistake. many countries whims larger countries, something could avoided using money set vaccine manufacturing buy raw materials produce them. That's actually really good point.  Sorry, mistake.

Edit: Spelling Ahh one states GDP pile maggots. Enjoy shithole! 🤣 wanted come back point right.

The US differing huge wave right now, even earlier predicted. really reason taking full advantage summer.

Except Delta strain currently exponential growth phase plenty evidence showing vaccines moderately effective preventing infection spreading virus.

The vaccines great reducing serious complications, hospitalization, death including Delta. community spread US worst since November.

Back May June, made sense say ""if vaccinated go act like things normal again"" make sense now. CDC changed guidance masks. harsh lockdowns, competent governemnt, lots vaccines great testing programs - really conspiracy - China great dealing Covid symptoms (or symptoms have) charts might help ease mind still less likely get sick vaccinated. alone reduces spread. get sick, however, contagious may add spread. However, much less likely need hospitalization, reducing impact illness healthcare infrastructure.

Both statements true, actually need read understand said. mean, headlines like pretty bad: told 6 feet probably year ago. Shit transmissible now. airborne virus all. I'm public roads general. So, ideally, there'd private roads. Allowing drunk driving would property owners. could choose whether like drive risky route not. There's lot incentive allow drunk driving business' property. I'm public land though, think free areas. government mostly dissolved public land split tribes, rest kept free area. government right sell that's sure.

However, currently, public roads all? Yeah support laws drunk driving. much threat others around yourself. Unvaccinated people hurting unvaccinated people. That's choice. one's forcing inject something. 

Straight though, think allowing drunk driving would cause increase accidents. ignore morality completely, social pressure young age drink drive, probably gonna care laws either. 

Why talk government corruption/regulation killed competition created taxi monopolies? Leading buzzed people drive themselves.  need make sure say - vaccines FREE EVERYONE - regardless income. FREE VACCINES! COME GET FREE VACCINES HERE!

I know folks transportation issues far getting vaccination site, hope local governments manage get distributed equal manner. Native American reservations also decimated reasons. language “Hispanic”? I'm sure they're devastated hell wears fur 2021? seen data UK saying need one shot survive? Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* mentioned reports VAERS, understand many people get vaccine 80+ years old. People pass number things, way VAERS works *anyone* report something, even I.

So let's say 90 year old gets vaccine, passes week later, family could report adverse effects. However, remove vaccine, likely person would passed regardless.

One huge thing consider: look quickly paused Johnson Johnson vaccine due rare serious side effects. even controversy decision since rare, agreed smart pause. 

So, willing completely pause J&amp;J rollout *height* pandemic relatively small (but still serious) occurrence, would *also* paused either Moderna Pfizer injuries happening.

To put perspective: Pfizer used throughout *world*, total number doses given (for vaccines) roughly 4.5 *billion*! That's huge! Yet, US, paused rollout J&amp;J rare occurrence. mind, nothing found either Moderna Pfizer warrant pause US, vaccines used much J&amp;J ever was. 

Despite uncommon J&amp;J vaccine is, still found problem. Like needle haystack, paid attention. provide tons confidence safety especially Pfizer Moderna. 

Now, compare total deaths covid. deaths, also long-covid devastating. There's simply comparison: covid horrific, vaccine incredible achievement.

Finally, think way: getting antibodies one way another. Everyone will, assuming survive real infection. Whether soon, next year, another variant, antibodies way individually everyone large.

If that's choice, rather antibodies *controlled inflammation* vaccine? smarted people world worked vaccines, designed safely give antibodies. may feel crappy day two, since people zero headaches aches, least controlled.

A real covid infection? That's uncontrolled inflammation, whims brand new virus that's mutated deadlier forms, virus may even leaked lab. Sounds gross.

So, that, try get vaccine. Tell doctors concerns, maybe wait onsite hour so. They'll make sure good, probability, will.

If post helps others get vaccinated, I'll happy. fine, also happy got it! :) really spiking up.   happen one countries vax rates low (for whatever reason) spread US, even could get 90%of citizens vaccinated? Agreed. ""community"" Americans care Us vs. Them.  
Maybe Fauci could not-so-subtly suggest ""team"" win get vaccinated, they'd finally give in. caught week ban r/politics ""expressing extreme indifference"" another antivaxer dying. Seemed like oxymoron.

You see it, that's designed. Neither immune system. idea millions upon millions people safely get vaccinated get problem exactly day 273 whatever goes immune system works.

Whrn talking long term complications, ehat talking odd/rare interactions situation road (for example, vaccines cause problem someone gets shingles road) take time given rarity two situations occurring. Fortunately since 4 billion vaccines given, there's thing rare situation. mean get would same. People without extreme circumstances wouldn’t cautious. know, that's literally commented exact thing fucking said. Still working it. Thanks asshole journey entire time. Plus, could start speaking Greek since write it. maybe would get really good math variables. First thing understand immune system works. Whether it’s natural vaccine essentially introducing “foreign” agent body body primes self protect humoral (antibodies) cellular (memory cells etc) long term protection. immune system distinguish foreign body either vaccine virus actually invades body.

There cases issues vaccine cdc everyone else seems gloss over. Yes millions doses given 1-2 thousand issues statistically significant factor risk. rather evaluating occurred it’s easier gloss over.

Long term protection cellular component like memory cells. say another interview cases would drop like UK weeks. business must booming?? violates case law already rules surrounding ""prior restraint.""  higher vaccination rates, vaccinated make percentage - it’s common sense. doesn’t mean vaccines don’t work, less unvaccinated. proves unvaccinated need get vaccinated. Employers mandate vaccines, mandate vaccines travel planes public transportation, schools available kids. shouldn’t show vaccine card forever - pandemic stage there’s constant panic media every variant. vaccine still least 80% effective delta - cases people vaccinated 

Not everyone get vaccinated, - better end constant restrictions mandates go teach world population entire Greek alphabet, start using cuneiform! we'll see really deadly variants. That's awesome. Better late never. hope keeps up.  paid 2-day vaccine holiday would helpful.

100% agree. difference vaccination rate higher Canada really matters Delta. 

For OG Covid, 20-30% unvaxxed population could get spread it. Delta, even fully vaccinated people get spread (although make sick enough go hospital die) means theory potentially 100% population spreaders. many spreaders means increased viral load 20-30% unvaxxed catch facing worse outcomes OG Covid. Studies claim big countries need least 85% population vaccinated entirely get back normal. First thing understand immune system works. Whether it’s natural vaccine essentially introducing “foreign” agent body body primes self protect humoral (antibodies) cellular (memory cells etc) long term protection. immune system distinguish foreign body either vaccine virus actually invades body.

You’re right, even factors play. lack African American doctors means symptoms always treated (there several famous studies showing black patients’ pain believed non-black doctors way white people’s pain is, example). There’s also history america medical experimentation black people without permission, making rightly suspicious medical procedures government involved. maximum number huge wrongs you’re cast science? thats true matter aren’t closing borders?

But resulting deaths. still 10 fold peak pandemic. 

How go back type normal advocated restrictions masks, social distancing, covid passports, vaccine requirements, possibly lockdowns?

Stop how? even mean? vaccine preventive measure covid.

Anyone unvaccinated point clearly thinking people. Personally, beyond forgiveness point. However, vaccinated, that's unlucky sorry. Live let, die. taxes low.  Yup, dad two kids interracial marriages still decided keep spewing racist shit. 

Then gets surprised want around holidays.

If get point, it’s you. mRNA vaccines seem much better old flu shots though. science pretty good now. think time kept stockpile ourselves. Time vaccinate world allow Survival Vaccinated. Delta isn’t even close bad smallpox, it’s complete joke compared smallpox. Smallpox like 30 percent case fatality rate…delta joke can’t compared. CDC needs way better messaging. instance, what’s end pandemic look like CDC slow respond things like delta variant? It’s okay might know give us idea

We know always unvaccinated people abroad. Also always mutations virus current vaccines still largely work make booster shots needed  you’re parent don’t know talking about. IY  Behold! field grow fucks

  July. seemed like outside, one wearing one. inside, people - way better home. 
I feel like people (locals) much edge Covid. markedly different IMO. think they’re rock hard place needing safe Covid yet also need tourism income. BFF tested positive today Covid, full vaxxed since March w/ Pfizer, vaccinated days. lunch together yesterday outdoors, together 2.5 hours so. I’m worried her, think got unvaccinated 8 year old, positive asymptomatic. tested today three kids negative, one kid vaccinated parents positive. Ugh, ready ride. I’m going stay away unvaccinated kids get tested Monday. would think chances getting low? case vaccine. know that's simplification

Its simplification ignores massive difference telling employee bodies alternatives exist plastic guard....

That difference difference there's literally reason get vaccine millions adult babies can't own, either decide society let die make get vaccinated using tools have, employer government mandated vaccines.

I've said million different comments disagree strongly I'll list disagreements.

1. would simply die. That's factual look happen high rates people unvaccinated. Factually percentage find unsavoury would die, still small percentage would die, much larger still less majority percentage would get ill.


  reality would simply incur cost inconvenience us due booster shots variants.

2. many tools encourage vaccination numbers involve violating people/force public messaging speak people, incentives etc. also ways employers maintain safety without forcing vaccination, strict mask/test adherence. 

  also want point rates bad reddit pretends are, listed previous comment thread. think uphill battle people seem saying running options take care people. 

Your phrasing makes sound like impending doom, that's case. Again, literally people country vaccinated. That's hyperbole lie.

This idea flustered panicking everyone going supported fact.

Even context given ICU situation sound like good supporting evidence this. fact mind posted source could taken differently based minutiae term means. Like covid patients, usual numbers, numbers decreased etc etc.

Even then, feel pretty absolute forcing people. think line extremely important one. also think what's important realize vaccinated people pose little immediate short term threat us. Like little. Good. needs mandated. That's exactly meant, issues exporting jabs stuff, also manufacturing those. also major anxiety say nothing worry about. know talking kind sounds head well. may feel bad couple days worry catching disease infinitely chance putting tube throat dieing. playing Russian roulette. vaccine technology studied 20 years, already FDA approved. standard approval doesnt use much safety info. emergency one basically standard allowed made faster. There's 1 vaccine side effects chance happen got covid. covid one severe  mean guys got voting 7 points right nation ?

Yeah, he'll fine  NO, NO. kind thinking outright twisting meaning freedom.

Freedom (more precisely, liberty) unconditional. liberty goes far infringe someone else's liberty begin with. attempt argue otherwise inherently saying liberty important supercedes people's. completely unacceptable.

In context what's discussed here, refusal vaccinate interacting public increases health risk people one interacts with. also increases one's health risk, evidenced many times, plenty gets sent hospital. guess who's footing expensive hospital bill? always public, unvaccinated patient.

There scenarios getting vaccinated problem whatsoever. example, one never interacts others people. one willing take full financial non-financial responsibility infected people, got sick. many willing make commitment? bet you, ONE.

Ever heard idea cause-and-effect? aforementioned harm inflicted unvaccinated people cause. limitation choices (for example allowed indoor dining) effect. want effect? really easy, cause. want freedom choose, want right risk exposure unvaccinated people too. right supercede mine? think basically impossible. R0 Delta 7, means 10 people infect 70 new ones. get R0 1, need protect 61 70 people (so 10 people infect 9).

That means need 61/70 = 87% vaccinated. that's vaccines 100% effective, even ""only"" 90% effective need vaccinate 96% population. 

If virus R0 7, vaccine 80% effective, literally can't reach herd immunity vaccines. Even get 100% uptake, effective 14 70 people (20%), 10 still infect 14 cases rise. Nope. posted kid ventilator numbnuts responded “no price high keep freedoms”. care kids fetuses. don’t catch covid, ride free turns living Florida comorbidity. 4 million dead say dead wrong that. covid #1 killer US 2020, may top 2021 rate. 400 kids died far, number seems accelerating concerning rate.

beyond death thing happen, child could end long term even permanent damage.

and even getting issue vectors vulnerable peope. Negative. shit heads wearing mask, could use facial recognition deny admission overwhelmed hospitals. Western. mask mandate that's basically it. lack testing positive case transparency really makes believe shit gonna get real. ditched daily check-ins ""we're responsible enough keep kids home sick"". Immediately everyone asking keep kids home ""sniffles"" parents calling delta cold. entire pandemic taught anything people definitely responsible comes self interests. confirmed purchases though. sure satisfied year. I'd like see DeSantis put covid floor treat patients. Probably need PPE since believe it. seems know everyone covid, guess time doctor people. ya, probably right along basic income get too

and free housing (inside chain link fence, guess maybe call like ""cage"" ""house"" maybe...) Moderna says vaccine’s protection holds six months. Maybe got lucky avoided catching covid there. [In case you’re distant family gives main reason aren’t vaccinated. 

And late mid 80s.  think focussing wrong people case.

Those 12 anti-vaxxers US Americans. clearly lacking science education. *Forbidding* restaurant workers washing hands. FTFY.  NERD!! doc note medical file adverse affects vaccine.  Possibly, higher risk people likely vaccinated, hopefully bad. 

Also 4-6 week timeline original covid (I believe). know Delta kills faster. willing, idea government forcing take medication think folks hard time, even said medication low rate negative side effects.  fly masked myself, much less child unmasked. 7-8 days. caught getting vaccine. pretty sure recovered fully own. wait Texas Minnesota state fair. events top 2 million attendees. think count unique participants, could easily 750,000 unique people each. Fauchi liar eat dick [King (Seattle area, think around 70% adults 30 day period ending July 21st: 88% COVID hospitalizations fully vaccinated, 87% deaths fully vaccinated, 75% cases fully vaccinated.

That seems bit bad me, things considered. hard make sense things, think Delta really rampaging unvaccinated cases high again. Deaths fairly low though, 0-2 per day.  “Do give damn?” Mr. Edwards asked. “I hope do. do. I’ve

Also something like 4-6 weeks initial infection death. one would assume rate infection higher 4-6 weeks ago. point, known someone personally bad case? people still believe ""real?"" roughly doubling every two weeks?

Uhh source come area large mexican population. moved Florida really strange really mexican culture around. outskirts one big cities.

There ""mexican food"" restaurant nearby workers white, ""tacos"" stuff like balsamic vinegar them. teacher well, can’t take homeschool. work, also means putting greater risk, too. already working boosters new variants. Many states already online systems validate info. outside. Risk transmission outside extremely low. actually evidence airborne transmission primary vector, fomite droplet transmission minor best. Well yeah tithing church member$ media money-driven, everyone else America. nobody interest clicking good news. exact thing reddit: news good, everyone super excited leave sub. source?  Yeah frustrating FDA dragging feet this. There's 0 percent chance deny approval, we've given billions doses, see hold is. competition COVID-19 Hurricanes point COVID-19 flu. Treat is. novel type coronavirus highly contagious deadly. Sheesh. 

I always think kinds growth rates (cases doubling every week two, more) signature uncontrolled spread.

This kind growth happening place US now. That’s around defamation, physical harm, restricted public officials later cases.

If John Doe gets sick dies COVID declined vaccine FoxNews told bad pretty straightforward Jane Doe sue FoxNews damage caused lie.

There already attempts “entertainment news” gets away saying [“reasonable viewers would consider contested statement that, make longer legal defense law, suddenly FoxNews change tune. guarantee it. people need hear  funny empirical evidence eventually gets ""principled"" morons change minds. population, we've loads cases time trials (~Jul-Nov last year). Every infection offers chance natural immunity. May great/long-lasting, something. population level, unvaccinated slightly less risk before. Therefore vaccines effect, measured relative unvaccinated, could lower.

All holds original wild type virus only. course know Delta infectious that, statement 'less risk now' probably true across variants. vaccines may quite great new variants also (but still good). However, good thing oxygen **will** become dangerously low

I use absolute here. would say ""most likely"" instead ""will."" uncommon, breakthrough infections require hospitalization happen. brother clinicals local hospital told patient 50 (according him) relatively healthy fully vaccinated, still spend time hospital (not sure ended ICU / vent / ECMO case not). Unfortunately, black/indigenous people color communties lagging far vaccination rates. picture really sum all. plans get full FDA approval early september, allow many grafe schools already spreads crazy fast kills host therefore reason become less deadly. get fatal here.

So likely deadlier rather faster contaminate months/years? contrary? Never, like flu. attending person meetings pandemic without vaccine time. really need warning infection outbreak? Sounds like would ignore like info available. There's nothing allows verification information that's document. form handwriting never proof anything. filled blank one made stuff one would able tell. That's problem. usual US 50 years date. important mention that, average, person becomes infected goes spread virus somewhere around 5 10 people. people spread around 5 10 *additional people*. chain continues, unless people antibodies defend it. 

Meanwhile, person contracts COVID roughly 1 50 chance death.

All preventable shot safe, free effective.

For decades, vaccines mandated (for example) attend public school 50 states DC. Vaccine mandates [safely eradicated many still get rid COVID, too. need everyone part. going say exact thing. constant media frenzy fucking killing humanity faster virus ever will. Except vaccines allow infected people get better faster. period time infections lower.



People seem overlook that.



Plus unvaccinated person likely clog hospitals, ERs, ICUs. like Florida cause shortages things like oxygen. True. older need careful general. flu, pneumonia, sorts things larger effect age. Somewhat escape immunity doesn’t mean it’s effective. Studies efficacy currently place, even lowest efficacy shown mid-60 % range, it’s still effective infection effective severe disease.

The fact case loads high absolutely consideration type business reduction shows highly doubt capacity restrictions reinstated. I’m saying it’s impossible return, doubtful. Look pushback reinstating indoor mask mandates caused. say anything dying. said recovering. indicates suffering long term effects it, recovering well it. guess answered idk shaping 20% new cases among vaccinated people, vaccinated people contagious similarly unvaccinated people. 

In event, current cases US far exceeding cases last summer still climbing rapidly. see great reason complacency. hard understand, CDC media able give facts like transmissibility without people black white going “then vaccines?!” 

It hard understand people read headlines people CDC actually say vaccine prevent transmission all.  Exactly. vaccines push mutate, basically breeding come transmissible deadly. Stop ignorant get shot please.  25% mild infections long term debilitating effects.

People focusing wrong thing. flu kill old people lot, thing r value 8 crazy number *with* level masks sanitation. white conservatives ones throw biggest fits vaccines.

That's quite right. throw biggest fits white conservative, true. white conservatives throwing fits. That's point, things get skewed think fit-throwers big group actually tiny one. I'd prefer way.

Depends broadly meant this, currently kids 11 eligible. seems like Delta variant set sweep schools soon things start (and parents).

I know numbers Long Covid vaccinated folk, hope they're small.  Correct. whole numbers, number unvaccinated Republicans least 3-5x number unvaccinated African Americans.  Thanks DeSantis. tough rightful lack trust people color vaccines government. going take folks much smarter turn around. recent [UK page 18-19 there's relevant info. unvaccinated under-50s (presumably under-30 since vaccinated strict age order), 5% visited hospital 1% stayed overnight. would much lower-severity threshold US, hospital visit expensive casually, 1% probably best comparison. 0.035% mortality. time mass vaccinate, dragged feet. choice. isn’t government preventing “entertainment news” companies airing anything.

It’s simply government saying hurt listening lies it’s easier sue them.

They still lie want; deal legal liability lies. awesome. Great hear.  Livingston? Lol 😤😤 “long term side effects” vaccine far risky short term likelihood getting COVID + unknown long term side effects virus. 

Also, hasn’t seen people dying “left right” virus. 

Can’t argue people know always right! % total population California vaccinated ? Vaccinated older people might get average age vaccinated people.

An unvaccinated population exposure thus low natural immunity covid get unvaccinated population already 2 years exposure thus natural immunity.   But, going outside naked really less harmful? mental ramifications seeing someone naked unsolicited damaged many peoples psyche forever. That’s like saying mental abuse less harmful physical abuse. They’re different compare. ""fake"" vaccine sites tell everyone ""saline"" give free ""fake"" vaccination card? downvoted :/ wear mask vaccine effective would worry get too?

Because children vaccinated option change that. Also, lots people immunocompromised even vaccine can't fight virus ability change that. allergic ingredient vaccine can't vaccinated, also choice.

Because virus replicates total mutations. total mutations likely one (or more) able infect vaccinated. Viruses replicate living bodies. body vaccinated knows kill virus kill virus replicate much any. body vaccinated clue deal virus virus replicate lot body figures starts actually able kill it. lot kill gone. Every body know fight virus greatly increases chances vaccine stops working. probably variant defeats vaccine? implies? assume one shot Pfizer one shot moderna similar effectiveness rates? received Pfizer first moderna second. shame, HAES movement supposed promote worrying physical activity, cardiovascular shape, muscle tone instead worrying exact scale number pants size. course, one treated *lesser human* obese; everyone deserves base level human respect.

Also, I’m really sorry hear you’re position. It’s really tough discuss reality family won’t hear it. hope whole family stay safe chaotic times. Many thanks hearing kinda replying snark. Sending best. Even Brazil catch US month /r/angryupvote   half population California fully vaccinated point. 

What say true theory, applicable real world moment. country jurisdiction anywhere near 100% vaccinated. Holy cow sounds stressful. Well, least vaccinated seems top everything within control. got this! last post I’ll make day:

Do y’all think we’ll ever reach point pandemic 14 day quarantine rules longer necessary? know wouldn’t anytime immediate future, I’m curious see people think.  may true, you’re 70 conditions, royally sucks. Legitimately, real risk cases high.

People won’t stop world forever, people try bit harder get control. time people got elected would willing invest this, everyone decided pretend pandemic over.  Last year freedum people kept screaming ""iT’s FLU!!!” pissed off.  now, vaccinated get COVID, likely like flu. Sure (like flu) severe cases, general you’re fully vaxxed up, likely won’t bad. nations vaccinating large portions population every six months thus able act ""done"" COVID...

That's working well good old USA. California county generates Proof Covid QR code. Also name, DOB dates shots. 

Too bad Covid cards aren’t odd color like regular vaccine cards. Yellow Fever proof vaccination yellow.  ...1919.   Broadway show song Avenue Q says: Sucks You!

EDIT: actually ""Me"" rather ""You"", get point. relisten song get desserts. Darwin takes another FDA may approve something months. words touch. Seatbelt laws helmet laws substantially reduce supply healthy organ donations, I’m huge fan. Never fight man perm. dick, get vaccinated rather small counties according article case loads ""aren't staggering"". 

These smaller hospital groups can't take *any* moderate shift case loads given operate closer edge profitability hire personnel/maintain facilities based profitability profile. 

It ""good"" people think is. 500 deaths week climbing, that's 1,998 dead month, good many republicans. like AME stonk funeral homes need on?  We're conditioned believe vaccines allow us go lives whether behavior risky things vaccinate virulent sneaky. Breakthrough happen, lesser rate sure, mix around other's spaces vaccine job, harder get vaccinated vaccinated less risk hospitalized dying. Let's smart lambda whatever variant comes out. hope would like see explanation Kentucky study different Cleveland Clinic study. Ooff Delta increased infection rate lethality children, teens, young adults OG Covid? 

I’d say science currently says yes.

Is increased infection rate lethality bad we’re gonna morgues full young people September Americans don’t start hunkering again? 

I doubt it, vaccines still work Delta. Get vaccinated, wear mask crowded indoor settings (since that’s currently CDC guidance advises), chances getting severe case low.  comment extremely racist since large percent minority communities vaccinated.  It’s ignorant think states vax mandates enforcement go away. global issue. Regardless states abide mandates, happens new strain develops another country? viruses don’t pay attention borders. I'm sure happy this. So, may ask everybody got free Krispy Kreme donut? Here's update [Brazilian food thought. Note comments ""antibody resistant P1"", accounting nearly 100% cases Brazil. conclude way could spread fast could reinfect.    God: literally made people smart enough create offer vaccine could've saved you, decided spread propaganda avoid it. lack vaccine knowledge concerns you, gonna mind blown find majority Texans know simply geography kidneys located.

The thing is, classes part normal public school system. experienced myself. Yes, taught vaccines, viruses, immunity, mitochondria powerhouse cell (lol). problem people fucking dumb, stubborn, self-centered, like learning new concepts. Taiwan illegal intentionally spread covid misinformation reasons mentioned.  kids school AZ one too. I’m pissed beyond words.  wish hadn’t commented truly feel suffering hands morons. guess feel lot less morons suffering hands. 

I hope things get better sooner rather lather.   issuing recommendation specifically might make sense may unique issue immunocompromised people don't. 

If doctors refusing recommend immunocompromised people general (like person claimed), that's odd. delta strain much contagious, tends burn much quickly Beta. 

Gonna shit show, it’ll come go pretty quickly. Look curve Great Britain decent idea what’s come. Many schools Ontario dealt putting class pods (a group kids max, work other). distanced groups. Classes came went different times, designated entrances. Teachers allowed group, stay classroom. 

There cases schools, things, small sections schools would shut down, rest continuing. heard outbreak hit school, really meant one people single class caught it.

I agree vaccine need get approved kids.  kid going school year (senior kindergarten. start Sept here). virtual last year rough end.  school board option switch virtual person october, well Christmas, probably March, like past school year. owned company, company get decide employ, right? can't hire random dickwad street call quality engineer. Well, can't apply logic say employers ability refuse hire anyone want, therefore want keep job, get vaccinated?

The company picking risk unvaccinated employee gets sick makes others sicks, risk reduction measure. something employees decide stay unvaccinated, employers deal with? 

Already company drug screenings hire people able lift 60 lbs line work. logic ""forcing people things bodies"" might well stop drug screening, physicals hiring, annual fitness tests, too.  examples obvious case one things like other.

Its perfectly fine limit something people. fine method limitation force something body want done.

Driving? Guns? None involve amount forced procedures. 

The fact tried compare licenses bodily autonomy blatantly bad job, etc.

You tremendously dishonest think forcing people able provide literally effect forcing whatever saying alternative.

It's like saying putting someone duress forcing something. case literally advising people unable work. capitalist country means simply can't continue live. able work privilege obviously arguing vaccine mandates inherently political, especially based something arbitrary asinine bodily autonomy, used context.

Arguing also inherently political. literally political measure arguing favour of.... point think making here? topic inherently political topic. topic policy be.

Also, plainly disgusting would call bodily autonomy asinine.

Your comment filled brim dishonesty bad faith. Yeah, fine. *choose* work government (including military), homeschooling always option really care.  Sadly no. state 50% vaccinated. St. Louis City crossed 50% initiating vaccine. rural areas even lower, Springfield similar STL went poorly. really sad many people squandered vaccination. Source? see multiple sources claiming J&amp;J effective Delta would life jeopardy they’re vaccinated though?  LOL  K417N mutation, picked beta. AFAIK reason 417n mildly scarier 417k believe anywhere near bad delta, basically clickbait.  never rule celebrate death anyone ironic death many lives probably saved.  see that? part thread you’re replying tangent specifically government forcing get vaccine. type people would beg put seatbelt FD arrives breaks Jaws Life. long private chat old acquaintance Facebook posting ton antivax memes scary sounding posts. proper chat aggression, questioning other's logic healthy way.

It profound much simply understand situation. said make sense unvaccinated people supposedly creating variants ""Aren't viruses constantly evolving time? unvaccinated it?""

Like literally know. grasp logic transmission = reproduction cycles = chances significant mutations. best explain without sounding condescending. Hopefully thinks bit. hospital data versus Missouri's data shows Missouri lagging around 1500 cases point. death certificate dumps later time bury data. course one else wants talk things coming Springfield's hospitals show deaths jumping. looks like God needed idiot.  making statements without statistics behind it.  Wait minute, I've never seen someone refer anti's... antis... des santis... DeSantis confirmed Building wall Starting sound like great idea. need start around florida. Government forces everyone things society. see life saving vaccine issue.  long them. rest want get this. downvote valid/important question.

There lots articles saying ""may"" need boosters line. ""The recent Pfizer-BioNTech data shows 91% overall efficacy falling 84% six-month mark, steady 97% severe disease."" Yale

The CDC always waits data discussion recommending action. need wait longitudinal studies CDC/FDA recommend boosters. expect recommend boosters early 2022 enough data immune response 12-24 months initial vaccination.

Meanwhile, today, public seeing huge covid wave breakthrough infections vaccinated adults expected. can't rely immunity enough adults vaccinated. vaccines young children. worth ""low consequence"" unknown/unexpected risk booster shot rather ""high consequence"" risk breakthrough infection potentially harming child/immunocompromised adult (self otherwise). 

I got covid shot pregnant January, CDC/FDA recommendations pregnant women (thanks guys) excluded trials. unknown risk low (to me) vs known risk contracting covid (v bad outcome me, unknown risk baby). thinking getting vaxxed pregnant gave baby 2+ months protection birth.

There evidence breastfed babies covid immunity 6 weeks 80 days mom vaccinated. Past antibodies wain/are insufficient. Given expecting vaccines approved babies 2022/3, booster shot might buy another 3 months keeping baby safe. might nothing. know right call 2022/23 data. wish could say I’m tired headlines.  Y'all still thinking death likely outcome getting covid? Na, always long term disability likely thing, statistically speaking. numbers all.  still something never want either. I'll take third shot prevent that. What? ""prevented reach shores"" - Beebo help us. Good bye. Let know still alive year. I'm paying taxes schools children. want play putting people risk, deal consequences. Suck get vaccinated. Sure. nationalistic xenophobia, could go wrong? Fine will. I’m giving another year life everyone else. it. can’t go like forever. end? opposed vaccines?

Why opposed honest arguments?

It amazes people literally refuse go past black white reasoning.

You nuance understanding usefulness vaccines thinking people forced employers anything bodies.

Employers employees. want anything resembling that, means absolutely necessary people still choice happens.


I also point reiterate ability nuance, Im double vaccinated person country 70% people are, number rising. 

My ability nuance foreign you. 

The ideas:

* Vaccine = Good

* Employer control workers = Bad


Are perfectly able coexist.     psychedelic hold school rally?
(I'll leave now)  sitting room asked get it. trainee usually see said get main doctor trainee wife usually sees really say one way should. honestly surprised  I'm side coin gets really tiring explaining people yes I'm 36 yes I'm also really careful got vaccinated soon possibly could fibromyalgia want problems heart. sucks people act like irrational following stats want unlucky percentage. Especially people family know medical trauma already dealt with. deaths Biden’s fault,

To fair, see Biden anything early 2020 virus first arrived American soil, you? Throwing money something bound failure solve nothing. Public schools eliminated. Yup kids die die also statistic? Right? want take vaccine reduce odds developing complications factor 20 people watching loved ones die scum like you. fda mandate comes out, hope idiots like persecuted full force law. Maybe dead families get justice. Good news lot could use topping 20 years.

Spouse got MMR boosters titer showed declining protection. Tetanus usually every 10 years anyway. daughter turns 12 next month. I'm getting vaccinated soon can. Crazy angry devastated couple towers destroyed thousand lives lost. right 500,000 deaths virus easily slowed even stopped masks, distancing, vaccines, many refuse it, yet none seem give shit. worst part people fully know/trust vaccines works complicit spewing misinformation (and covid whole) ratings extent people literally dying salve available. think it’s assumed folks fox, congress, etc actually believe hype they’re spewing, don’t. they’re class grifters.   believe science...when validates beliefs. (IF ever validates beliefs, incredibly rare) AGREED. pandemic really *for vaccinated*. really is. Even get virus, statistically *does fucking matter*. need emphasizing this. NBC reporting Delta booster vaccines overhyped, vaccinating unvaccinated valuable. today. Live life really. can’t lump vaccines category smallpox &amp; flu equal risk believe talking something unrelated comments, I'm sure disagreeing with. Let help that.

Facts:

1. Masks help prevent spread Covid, requiring good thing.
2. Vaccines help prevent spread Covid, also reduce severity effects Covid, good thing.
3. Masks intended precaution used perpetuity; time fairly low vaccination non-herd immunity, know vaccinated, following CDC guidlines wearing masks reduce spread could potentially die good thing.
4. bad thing politicians turned masks vaccines political wedge issue.
5. good thing despite political pressure opposing mask mandates Florida, university still everything protect health community, imposing mask mandate regardless political pressure.

With said, help understand disagree with? expect 'flood' goalposts moved Vaccines incredibly effective. Yes, unfortunately lost still losing lot vulnerable people covid, vaccines reason we're seeing death rate drop, fact ""truly vulnerable"" gone. 

Just anecdotally lose single person family, know lot truly vulnerable people. Hell, husband's 96-year old grandma caught covid survived! That's severe pneumonia infection months before. vaxxed thankfully. 

Anyway vaccines amazing. Even best places vaccine drives still 25- 30+ percent population unvaccinated. Lots bodies virus burn through. It’s shame covid tribal Interestingly enough, Moderna luck SHIV using mRNA technology. hope goes somewhere, said retroviruses whole different animal. analogy isn’t applicable situation. Nurses Human Resources, metaphor now:

I car factory workers assigned separate stations: engines axels. working engines work axels production demanded vice versa. 

Emergency happens I’m running engines. stop axel production use conveyor belt, cool, then, instead taking axel workers putting engine production line, **I tell go home** even though shortage engines still needing made engine axel workers working engines

I’m really confused you’re still understanding something simple Valid, suspect people still wearing masks protection surrounded unvaccinated people. people K/N95 masks would huge upgrade. Virginia remove date slider cases vaccination status? really enjoyed able set date last 2 weeks month see things trending. know why, feels like breakthrough infection rate climbing move try convince people get vaccinated (hurry people).

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* depends getting vaccination numbers up. thing manageable high percentage vaccinated people. That’s couple months ago No. doesn’t lead totalitarian shit. It’s slippery slope. thinking automatically reaching. already mandate lots things health wise. agree country, people would lose minds mandated vaccines. way going go really this:

Armed Citizen: can't fire rights!

Armed Boss: told get fuck already.

Armed Citizen: ... OK then... ^(asshole)  Lol unions would push back hard anything even smells like vaccine mandate. I’d pay amount money watch livestream. One allergic doctor wants take series pills prevent reaction course 6 weeks get shot grandkids doesn’t want medical reaction meds she’s got like 2 weeks start process.

Without knowing more, I'd call flimsy excuse, mostly children cannot vaccinated rely adults around protection, failing another friend cancer drug study ended making blood clots causing blood thinners rest life skeptical new drugs.

Unless I'm mistaken, studies called studies designed study possible new drug, may may work may serious side effects. Patients sign paperwork stating understand risks. likely good law court recognized right medical privacy bodily autonomy Roe. Jacobson 1905 court analyzes fundamental rights changed substantially since them. current conclusion might analysis going different. *""Because mask works extremely limited context (eg working vulnerable people working closely people sick).""* - **Demonstrably incorrect.**

*""They used also signal person wearing sick/vulnerable stay away them, work everyone wearing one.""* - **Anecdotal conjecture, also demonstrably incorrect. find funny freely switch 'pure data vacuum' anecdotes supports confirmation bias.**

*""The reason work irrelevant though I'm arguing consequence. mandates worked, would correlation. one, therefore mandates work.""* - **Hops right back 'selective reasoning vacuum' see.**

The entire basis argument singular data-point, failing (refusing?) factor variables support view.. bordering dogmatic. 

Unfortunately, I'm afraid standing firmly foundation delusion profoundly short-sighted hollow reasoning. 
If society took limited, pedantic point view, progress advancement would cease entirely would 'throw baby bathwater' far prematurely, every-single-time.

I'll take leave conversation now. Again, best luck you.  Nearly 25% happened Florida. Governor Desantis sucks.

Also, quit vacationing ffs problem. I’m happy hear that.  Ron DeSantis would object apple knew healthy.   Thank crunching numbers me. appreciate it. prevent flying. mid terms year away. 2024 elections 3 years away. 

People short memories. One could argue well implied risk situation situations increase risk, something party assess relevant risk tolerance prior engaging situation.

But yes hurting others bad, unless agreed upon mutually two consenting (mentally) mature/sound parties. think Moderna better delta no? Due mrna. think israel ordering Moderna boosters thus. “But pandemic over!” /s

I’ve heard friends many times it’s really frustrating. People thought individual vaccination end all. Here’s hoping 🙏 fine, ""their hospitals remain open"" /s Oh please, rhetorics, mature. need better reading comprehension, sling random ass insults pretending superior. called kid. have, getting frustrated cannot read never stated anti-vax go long rant saying am.  Jacobson predate Roe bodily autonomy medical privacy laid Griswold lot. 1905 case even predates scrutiny analysis It’s good case law there’d probably need whole new scrutiny analysis application. It’s magic bullet; it’s ancient case. Well atleast cull boomers, might get social security all. problems. there's lot info piece together minds Amazing always *other* people brainwashed ones. Miraculously never seems ones leveling accusation 🤔 Thanks getting vaccinated.  around 3 (18-19yo) teens work break hi-fiving confirmed weren’t vaccinated said never would be. fourth teen looked like wtf. think need figure people aren’t completing vaccination regimen. Literally violation 4th 14th amendments. doubt lot rual area, widely promoted? travel around bell like ice cream truck? vaccinated people able spread virus would make sense. that's case all.

Vaccinated people spread COVID lesser rate unvaccinated; never going world zero COVID spread since vaccines offer sterilizing immunity strains either. Agree gvt seriously fucked communication many occasions trust low. one separate politics science.

From scientific point view, statements inefficacy agains delta mistaken: protection infection diminished, vaccines still offer good protection severe illness death. 

Although admit it’s sometimes easy get wrong impression sensationalist headlines, vaccines still much best way mess :) known. It’s irresponsible say certainty it’s safe. cure!

Nooooo! \*croaks\*

That‘s Florida. legal? I’m still good time 🤷🏽‍♀️ point everything don’t get vaxxed (sans children at-risk people ofc) thinking day one hear ""but know happen 10 years....""  though? people can't understand science statistics? guess yeah, that's pretty concerning, problem covid. Factually incorrect. Delta affects children far original alpha. don’t know viruses always mutate become less deadly. case million years would never get sick.

And problem virus it’s infection rate. 

Flu deaths per year range US 20,000 60,000 bad year. 

Covid deaths US 500,000 heavy restrictions place. 

There lot this. doesn’t get better. also time vaccinate everyone involved. borderline relevant movie : DeSantis = Bioterrorist chief hard imagine silver lining Source?  Sure are....... Authoritarianism generic political term essentially translates increased government control. opposite libertarianism, less government control. four quadrant political compass divided. varying degrees these, spectrum. authoritarianism totalitarianism, like libertarianism anarchism, extreme ends two sides. sounds like plenty people one shot. insufficient Delta variant. may unvaccinated wonder things would different thing killed kids well grandpa. I'm damn glad didn't, wonder would made difference would technically armed, long weapon never brandished, wouldn’t additional charge. Everyone carries gun. Even drive Nissan Leaf. thing would make police show remove said individual became belligerent pulled gun. that, Waffle House own. 

Our jail already overflowing. authorities going do? Imprison approximately 10% city makeshift door prison? cram people 5 cell delta variant running them? ask invented ""project warp speed"" Go ahead delete fake ass comment, educated. think makes worse now. year ago least patients put choice - ICUs full 20-45 year old idiots thought ""why bother, get bad case anyway"" - they're 99% right, comes nasty shock turned 1%. already got covid didn’t know didn’t symptoms ?  lockdown USA almost meaningless. lockdown you’re still allowed go shopping nose sticking mask. wonder 4D chess move self-sabotage republican's chances winning anything near future disproportionately impacting base. People here, general, favor increased government power control stand opposition liberty many circumstances.


No, people favor making world healthy kids, parents grandparents. literally plague people jackasses it. keep getting variants. Eventually variants different able get vaxed them. Guess happens next idiots? fault...period. I'm fine people wanting vaccine, start spreading bullshit nonsense others ...why increased talk lockdown now? states cases quite frankly, ones shutting sooner better.  is, I'm exhausted part society protects part society cross street help protect family. They've benefitted herd immunity long can't even see works anymore. Measles outbreaks coming us Covid hit.. back knows else. Chances tourists fully vaccinated, one dose less vaccinated. TWIV week said forget herd immunity anytime soon. Basically hoping vaccines + previous infections would allow skate relying others tough titties.    alternative getting full vaccinations rates 70%. know stabby bit needle forms top part triangle? CoINcIdeNCe??? Calling someone kid understands admit unable read understand scientific paper subject, makes look way mature you. Oh there's debate: 
  
[WP: Vaccine mandates backfire. People resist even  rhetoric efforts lead de facto national vaccine mandate, backfire: Americans walks life resist told put bodies, many resent politician institution makes get vaccinated, creating crisis legitimacy government, university business forces constituents, students employees get vaccinated. Indeed, president Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association already said, “There lot pushback” members organization federal employee mandate.  
  
I disagree opinion piece, that's need science determine would work here. 
I think would work, want ""go gut"". Dude, even young healthy Olympic athletes dropping dead, statistical risk dying covid fully vaccinated tiny pointless worry it. 

But yes, usually people poor health comorbidities, especially older people. people risk *before* vaccines even came out. think reached point government forcibly sterilizing people, things worry about. living 1984 universe. possible way FDA could influenced pharmaceutical companies.  one day? Worldwide? Let cultists rise stomped out. Finally. thank you. kids ok? I'm worried spreading kids, despite vaccinated, one thing keeps sane knowing kids ok covid infection. would suck one outliers well. Well shit. might need call people hate hear that, strong! could rough little ride day 7-10 strikes hard think it. hope doesn’t happen you. 

What vaccine take? Moderna, Pfizer, J&amp;J?   I'm sure pockets anti vaxers lot religions. Denmark, Netherlands Belgium pretty close well. Nordics France much behind either. BYE FELICIA! believe states currently anything could *remotely* call lockdown. think might couple states they've asked people mask indoors, likely enforced anything like months ago all. Many/most states still mandate masks contexts like schools there's national mandate public transit (planes, trains, buses, etc.). Fauci Florida""

Mission accomplished. mask works extremely limited context (eg working vulnerable people working closely people sick). used also signal person wearing sick/vulnerable stay away them, work everyone wearing one.

The reason work irrelevant though I'm arguing consequence. mandates worked, would correlation. one, therefore mandates work.  dude 100%. went local concert recently assumed masked people vaccinated. wanted vaccine 100% effective w mask combo ya know I’m agreeing you. pointing populations exactly ones need hospital care. talking hospital system employees resisting vaccine mandates. person feels way elderly isolating, presumed hospital employee talking about. 

My system mandated flu shots years. someone can’t it, can’t around patients. Based what? What's 'our countries'? I'm Scotland, we've already reached 90%. forget polio, we'd never got rid smallpox fraction many misinformed idiots smallpox vaccine distributed  Pro vaccine scary fucking precedent allow judges mandate involuntary medical procedures condition probation. - apeared 1970 FDA approval. Withdrawn 1997. That's 27 years even without censorship today. - 1957-1961, 10.000 newborn affected, 40% died birth. 

Think calling someone ""a danger society"". much unvaccinated spread COVID? Quiet, Magoo Literally Pearl Harbor yesterday 5-10 minute walk USS Bowfin (inside enclosed submarine), 3 15 people weren’t wearing masks wasn’t actively enforced. put diplomatically?

Better f u c k off! Yeah bullshit. quit job able keep kids home, savings gone PUA done. Trying cut costs everywhere get another job kids vaccinated, find something remote. heart breaking six year old I'm starting feel like sending back irresponsible. goes small montessori school thorough precautions, delta worried, even risks relatively low. hope offer virtual option. don’t think state would lockdown point. Maybe capacity limits something, doubt restaurants venues would close completely. 

Mask mandates think likely, I’d still doubt it. think many organizations, small communities, companies, etc. mandate employees patrons. whole state? probably won’t.  going done active attempts misinform people pandemic?

Until weeks ago kind shrugged shoulders heard BS people anti-mask anti-vac say realized keep hearing words, phrases again. There’s active element world pushing thoughts appears nothing it. Well CA, governor currently facing recall election due covid restrictions. . . don’t know, probably point. Personally, covid safety restrictions lockdowns, doctors nurses close friends family seen experienced makes motivates continue distancing following science guidance. I’m vaccinated, flight plans 10 days. I’m nervous. literally hate people much now. wanna travel I’m young, hot healthy… mfs keep coughing shit. AAAAAAAARGH!!! Vaccines moral science says save lives harm. 
If science said ineffective (it doesn't) would moral imperative.  
  strong behavioral science evidence mandates highly effective.  Republicans believe that... share you’ve heard? work global company originally said mandate Vaccines sent email Friday saying they're ""reassessing situation"". Basically they've realised others maybe jump aboard.  excuses Hispanics? Also government experimented White people well past. NEXT EXCUSE blame white people think bad? Keep spouting misinformation ignorance, contributing fiasco. We're going dealing fucking variants *years* everyone like you. deliberately obtuse folks incomprehensibly selfish dragging much longer needs go for. don’t understand - it’s almost he’s proud fact many people getting sick dying   actually remember provide vaccination status visa. green card though, better vaccinated hep a/b, tetanus, measles, mumps etc. got real nice cocktail vaccines physical since know vaccination card was. submission linking msn.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Bodily integrity is human right judge able force put stuff body. 

The right of a people to self-determination mean ruling unenforcable. 

That said: lawyer fully favor vaccinations, think anyone able force it. got right fuck life wish that.   going happen. shut voluntary, spontaneous local. People choose hole hunker things get bad. look situation decide bad without pay weeks sucks, making family without income forever prospect $100,000 hospital bill worse. juice worth squeeze.

Whether get bad open question point. Yep. I’m 18, vaccinated, living life (which may involve mask 10% time). wish. think we'll give Florida Texas run money. !remindMe 12 hours heard too, aug 11 announced. Idk merit though Teachers staff vaccinated now. state mandated vaccines consistent testing state employees (and includes teachers) first half says we've 48% uptake nursing homes Ireland definitely right, pretty sure close 100% doing? No. don’t think knows science advisors hired advise him. 

Sadly genius uncle biology professor something. Thus allowing inherit study biology someone bloodline.

So never get genius maybe injecting bleach UV light might cure virus. going disappear like magic 20 times. guess it’s question carrots sticks. need get pandemic fortunate enough vaccine free, overwhelming safe time still effective. Vaccines way mess. carrots don’t trick, perhaps sticks way. good mediocre teams struggled teams winning record.

The said Stafford. record winning teams pretty fucking terrible difference he's little help entire career. Dealing run game, shitty offensive lines, part terrible defense (with exception 2014). 

Kirk help world yet still puts mediocre numbers. good. Vikings made HUGE mistake giving contract need realize he's lost cause.  Yeah….think fine alternative. didn’t hold anyone force them. Yeah let's totally give kids heart swelling Yeah it’s covered people’s favorite amendment movements start try delay stop approval, especially among ones trying hurry along last year. Idk, Arkansas school district 4000 almost 1000 quaratine 2 weeks. point stop trying? true. realized write meant well. Obviously everyone natural immunity Alpha going get Delta, obviously have. 

And clear exactly mean 'twice likely Reinfected"". sounds like 50%, flip coin whether get Again. 

IF case, we'd need know would play span months possible exposures. read different way? get point believe there’s that. There’s active element pushing misunderstanding purpose it’s done crafty manner. 

I watched people local school board meeting last week visibly upset ( mad mind people bawling eyes ) decision masks schools again. convinced masks &lt;medically children. things saying sounded like fairy tales 100% convinced them. desperate ‘protect’ children masks. One neighbor mine two beautiful children sweetest woman world. 

It changed thinking people. Something rest us aren’t seeing influencing people. This. teach high school want someone spouts, ""CoViD aFfEcT KiDs!!"" answer age covid decides magically hit young people kids supposedly immune (shocker, dummies). Oh wait, can't fucking know that. need protect *everyone, regardless age* suffer it. 


I fucking terrified go back school delta make things even worse year. school debating optional rather mandatory masks. anti-vaxxer understanding math statistics?

I'm shocked! disagree, education. great grandmother read speak lick English came country 1910 10 years old work mill. even 80 years. fed kids healthy diet. knew good food good exercise good habits. complicated things. asking build rockets nuclear bombs here. People known good bad far longer science has.

Even kid Atari NES. parents spent time kicking us house go play rather letting us sit veg around TV. Why? educated smart, knew right thing children. cooked nightly meals home healthy food, packed lunch boxes good stuff like sandwiches juice. PhD's, one around even went college generation, knew right good. certainly time parents today things. Many times would roll 6 7 pm start making meals that's parent. nearly everyone two working parents, called latchkey generation reason (Gen X).

Where changed why, know somewhere lost way. That’s good! quite solution think is. 

Jailbreaking phone essentially exploiting security. it, whose say another entity also take advantage that? jailbroken, already done work them. Jailbreaks malicious exploits tend pretty solid overlap exploit work.

Beyond that, still mercy proprietary low-level code, software, drivers, blobs, etc built OS whose source code access to. goes apps running phone, official, jailbroken. Many modern phones basically black box security chips too, like Apple’s Secure Enclave Pixel’s Titan chip. don’t really direct access things doing, they’re still there, silently working background. 

The way truly sure top piece technology entirely “secure” supply hardware code yourself, isn’t realistic (and also carries problems, unless ability create 100% bulletproof, un-exploitable code, isn’t really possible either). mean, Google Apple don’t even that. OSes foundational forks existing work done Linux FreeBSD respectively, source hardware components well. 

Some people prefer go route flashing custom Android ROM Google bits removed. That’s one way go, you’re putting trust random person people online maintaining ROM, still running Android phone’s low level drivers, proprietary binary blobs, etc phone still works phone. 

Honestly, someone truly concerned stuff probably best actually using phone internet all. strong weakest link. Worse time last year... got covid. live southern Ohio I’m vaccinated. didn’t require hospital 8 days quarantine far. cant wait cry kid comes home sick acting like anyone's fault I'm sorry loss.
My great grandfather diagnosed prostate cancer given 6-9 month diagnosis. dead 8 days later physical deterioration happened 8 days mind blowing. dr gives estimate time frame mean that's definitely going time frame. Cancer sucks unpredictable. see amazing things cancer treatment using mRNA technology that's vaccines would understand highly unlikely vaccine anything decline.  Lots hypotheticals here. People refusing vaccinated increase risk worse mutations. logic point safety measures 100% effective. Biontech works it. It’s clickbait imo.  de facto band won’t work many areas many local sheriff police departments won’t enforce it. county’s sheriff literally told us wouldn’t enforce mayors mask mandate.

Waffle House would call police enforce vaccine rule police aren’t going arrest anyone it. DMV. 

In terms private businesses, yeah, ban would work. 

In terms serving vaccinated customers, good luck staying afloat you’re restaurant. local pa close required wearing mask bites. 

Once federal government steps enforce laws crazies come out. Please don’t take advocating lunacy, I’m telling see ground Trumpistan. wouldn’t get mad Christian amanpour telling bombs dropping Baghdad, don’t get mad me.  Already prepping next lockdown. Got enough movies toilet paper keep occupied rest 2021.

Thanks, DeSantis! You’re best! /s mandated air travel would boost vaccination significantly. 

I wish would already. It’s one things within federal government authority mandate.  I’m US, many states lockdowns refuse make vaccinations mandatory? Florida…and?  think Dec possible 2+?    Pfizer vaccine going FDA approved less month Yes, seat belt laws. people wanna take risk killing themselves, long hurt people, go Dear Floridians.

“You own.”

Love,

Your Governor. totally agree. thing even FDA approved yet idea could long term yet people act like brainer. got it, accept risk involved. Anyone acting like putting wayyyy much faith companies developing vaccine. understand people hesitant it. lot children responsible people. last time checked inject seat belts bodies. weak point constantly made. Again, inject body, fucking seat belt. daughter RSV 2 months old. needed breathing treatments every time got sick, like 8 years old. Nasty stuff. everyone vacinated children 12 vaccinated right now. ok unborn fetus dying, ok risking life born child. 

Also unvaccinated people clogging hospital system town preventing people receiving necessary medical care oxygen health problems. Well one always fly China get lol. yeah also believe attenuated virus one resistant mutations, since train immune system every aspect virus, instead pinpoint one spike proteins. They're listening [vice president's advice] faith folks mentioned first part response. even know difference? racially insensitive, racist?

Also what's racist anti vaxers obviously talking 

Well okay. They're necessarilly racist getting vaccinated, sure. also racist anyone supports trump cool letting racism fly, republicans general, majority anti vaxxers 

Also usually anti vax buying conspiracy theories, use racism convince people believe theory argument really ticks dumb internet.

Point X event history, equate currently happening say ""haha check facts, happened quit complaining"". can't always compare history present. Historical situations radically different terms stuff going time. particular instance sterilizing people based racism, happen nowadays. happened racism prevalent point happened try use justify policy today wrong. deSantis wears pants head roughly 3 weeks tourists Hawaii Hawaii strict rules travel. black white answer - mandates masks vaccines aren’t happening everywhere. mayor Boston somehow called vaccine mandates akin slavery

Yes, want vaccinate everyone approach virus rightly wrongly Absolutely, comment section seems clearly put display.  even remotely close Tuskegee experiment. idea, wanted wish speedy recovery. you’re vaccinated I’d think recovery would/could much faster average. so? vaccination protect taken disease? putting selves risk? Karma way. -- federal government's eased border restrictions set take effect Monday – meaning first time since March 2020, travellers U.S. allowed enter Canada non-essential Aug. 9, American citizens permanent residents allowed Canada provide proof they’ve fully vaccinated least 14 days. looks like Malta's rate everbody needs campus might, campus they’ll partying indoors like last year. - 24 hour period. (Friday). Thursday similar. 76 year old multiple co-morbidities, agree need produce distribute vaccines globally. moral thing do. I'm offered booster, I'll take it. offer almost-expired doses seniors two days expire county, instead throwing away anti-vaxxers want here?  Republicans: Covid isn’t real!
Also Republicans: Illegals spreading covid! make past first sentence; point say imply masks vaccines. continue, show wrote made think that? yahoos going create Sturgis Omega variant. Yes is. Go ask doctor-any md That’s theory too. want transparency understand situation. things Uber shitty, tell take precautions move forward. mean Antiva? word word I'm going right now. sucks cancel like would rather risk getting long COVID. mention desire catch contagious variant risk stuck country test turns negative. liked post, regardless dudes think. 1 known death, unfortunately wide scale contact tracing US idea risky event reality.

And situation different anyway since variant spreads lot easily. regretfully spent year life there, nothing open Saturday. odd town Exactly. *Everything* driven narcissism. Every single choice makes. He's pathological. Last year's election loss crushing public humiliation him. still can't accept it. ego cannot handle possibility another loss like that.

He run dogcatcher unless 100% certain winning ahead time. he'll pretend he's running last possible moment. covid, 4 days since symptoms occurred 2 days ago lost sense smell, common thing. However hour ago woken due awful smell, kinda mix onions something chemical like awful.
I know things common well, however heard happening covid, 4 days days since loss smell.
Anyone heard something like that? doubt got rid covid fast internet summed three words. study finds ~650 cases Covid across country patient self-reported travel South Dakota event dates, state, country forwarded result CDC.

I think fair say, study like never going remotely accurate.

Immediately event, major outbreak Dakotas area, states still representing intense spread country, despite relatively rural.

With said, I'll take step back. rally utterly brain dead 2020, Covid rapidly spreading throughout country, vaccines available.

In 2021, huge problem all. already do, it’s called FDA Capitalism. Thank - better now, took nearly 3 weeks get sickness :( totally agree - people don’t realize vulnerable children illnesses! sir incorrect: label uses label approved specific use FDA many _not_ trials testing indication dose use case. “label” referred FDA approved wording goes drug label. use prescribed outside FDA approved label “off label”. case kids COVID vaccines actually trials ongoing though likely yet published. keeping privacy decades experience area several advanced degrees. Folks ask pediatrician approach be. personally asking pediatrician vaccinating 11.5 year old. Thanks. don’t understand people go kids die. IMO hospital stay thing would go lengths avoid! Oh, see comment now. looking reply yours. mistake! doesn’t really change point though. Distribution matters *a lot.* Counties voted one particular direction way less vaccinated counties voted other. almost certainly disproportionately affect one particular old party. 

Insane sad became political. suppose Floridans might, lot dumb enough vote first place, so... Since pandemic began, 26 11,600 people Alabama died COVID-19 fully vaccinated, State Health Officer Scott Harris said Friday.

Regardless think vaccination agree bullshit statistic. vaccine available since beginning pandemic. including deaths vaccines readily available? think so, guess depends whether willing small thing help stranger not. Vaccination big deal me. I'm happy sake others.   “Schools doubling on…” no. Many schools, district included, tried pursue digital option choose it. POLITICIANS decided schools arena see fit. Mandate this, ban that, refuse fund things. detriment students. Place blame goes. Right you. 11 year old daughter 5'3"" 115lbs. 5 inches taller 10lbs heavier 14 year old sister who's fully vaccinated.  fines imposed Canadian government. knowledge haven’t received US charges/fines yet. I've known several people gotten claiming first dose pharmacy since really checking. Parents find way make work. guess faith do. 

What going say parents whose children become infected hospitalized, ""that's breaks""? sick hearing this. Kids don’t even option vaccinated us don’t want kids guinea pigs assume won’t future issues getting virus one ones hospitalized.  judge performance? Like surgery asked doctor “is surgeon good?” doctor responded “well he’s better last guy.” Would sufficient answer? Yes, is. However, think would huge breach ethics allow single doctor make decision emergency room. Waiting bunch kids die papers written, published, peer reviewed, etc., implement simple preventative measures like masking school kind fucked up, don’t think? wait problem become full blow crisis anything could easily make drastic mitigation strategies necessary.    health experts hoped 75% 80% population immune — including vaccinated already infected — virus could largely held bay. New analyses suggest delta, it’s closer 90%, maybe higher. 
    delta taught us know today useful decision-making today, things change quickly,” said Dr. Robert Wachter, chair department medicine UCSF. “Six weeks ago, thought sitting pretty. And, within course month, delta went blip dominant virus country, came understand came realize different beast.”

Article diagram: 75% 100% vaccination rate slow community transmission original virus Delta variant: obviously point logical conclusion something extrapolating person said

The issue extrapolation even based really said. claimed risk viruses eliminated costs, examples would make sense. 

I explicitly stated priority public safety issue limitless. might well say ""waterboarding good"" logical extreme ""drinking water healthy,"" even person clarifies. real example logic needing license drive, banning vehicles. like sure reply went back previous comment address different point.

It's point made comment discussed, i.e., one falsely claim read first line of. ""I also want point right public safety, particularly others vaccinated bullshit argument.""

You go chances ill, pointed high enough surge hospitals, may affect virus. literally explained based previous occurrences

It's based assumption made previous occurrences. saw deletion, made explanation it. point

The one hospitalization. contradicts claim public safety argument ""bullshit,"" guess addressing difficult you. don’t understand houses are. mean 650k dead free bit real estate market, would think.  I'd like know long immunity lasts taking vaccine. studied CS UF it’s one top public schools. Can’t remember exact rank IIRC definitely top 20. Another commenter mentioned Miami UCF also improving quickly. son 1st grade completely virtually, start summer enrolled summer program conducted school's property. 100% needed interaction kids (his behavior charts bad year virtually outlets).

3 weeks summer program caught cold (got tested, covid-19). Startling realization things say enforce (masks, distancing) prevent spread covid-19 really followed and/or kids can't control themselves. worked, colds going around since precautions also protect well.

We figure we're saved relatively high vaccination rate general responsible approach virus happened live, cases generally pretty low (but climbing).  👍🏻  feel like America deciding take nap goal line. vaccines, could over. much populace stupid get vaccine politicians gutless mandate it. self imposed crisis. 2-3x cases per day.
Way contagious.
Almost 2x people.
Willing bet people cautious. medical resources scarce, yes. Fuck people. medical resources available, means treat them! freedum Lol worse case scenario way Based last time hospitalizations hit record January, almost exactly number hospitalizations (not necessarily number ICU beds use) now, 8 days deaths really ramp couple weeks. mean, jumped today, know multiple days whatever.

Presumably medical staff learned lot since January, seen anything definitive Delta lethal hospitalization occurs, lethal last time, lot people going dying soon. back least paying lip service mitigation efforts, firebreak number cases led hospitalization, ICU death. moment, case counts still high.

Get vaccinated, please! made SELLING crime, bet would deter practice even more. worried vaccine-dodging variant? variant kills children?    i’m sure “could” international travel US surprisingly lenient compared countries. I’m hoping mandate traveling passengers employers require it. already require schools there’s long history it. country ever 100% close probably, end pandemic restrictions sooner vaccine mandates

Covid never going away vaccines best way manage sure medium long term  Society Neuroscience going rager it’s literally scientists. People unwilling get fully vaxxed sit ass like it’s apocalypse honest. think we'll seeing lockdowns time around. TX governor complete moron allowing local officials try control spread covid. Also letting schools set guidelines yeah. record, precedent people refused treatment past life choices like smoking, eating, drug use, etc. graphic transmissible vs deadly. 

it moves faster farther, increasing denominator (number people exposed). 2% case fatality rate, example, kills 2 people 100 get exposed 200 10,000 get exposed. 

if 2% cfr goes 4%, 100 get exposed goes 2-4. 

now, imagine scenario delta mutates kill slightly more… 26% isn’t majority, though. must read article you, part ID doctor said dumb?

Reality liberal bias.  first thought, person said figure using charts, it’s following trend it’s (on recent 7 day average could get charts, 3 887 cases breakthroughs, 0 2.43 deaths per day breakthroughs). sure hope bring back slide filter though.  Based. need stop dancing around anti-vaxxer scum. Yep. Right though tricky spot enough world vaccinated. enough people vaccinated, still much easier deal time. understand you’re coming from. Ultimately ended aggressive strain infecting unvaccinated vaccinated reducing transmission protection measures. vaccinated isn’t silver bullet, simply keeps visiting hospital major complications contract it. still spreads via us. Lambda studies indicated shows vaccine resistance lab it’s still pending peer review time. Hopefully it’s non concern. media CDCs mixed messages it’s surprising us follow along anymore. would extremely helpful quit flip flopping around start delivering consistent message. 🤷 He’ll likely included recommendation boosters based age. terrible enough, redditors trying funny Don’t even get started mayor Boston…I miss elected one, honestly. replacement one hack.     cases jumped 85% last week July.

Not hard starting like 30 girl Arkansas recently died long COVID 11, among others.

Anecdotes beat data. someone posted day, significantly kids died RSV Covid far year yet one seems concerned, probably news running story one every night. I’m suggesting kids die. I’m pointing based covid-19 data kids risk. assume otherwise point negligent. disagree, freedom exceptions. Additionally, unvaccinated infinitely risk eachother vaccinated. enough reason, therefore, use ""for good many"" approach people short fat Covid that's ok.

Wait think I've mixed metaphors. boosted average IQ 5, compared 2019 need let deer know social distancing. God forbid people try little fun while. realize pandemic mess, climate change us leaping cliff, horrible things happening world. seriously, lighten up, champ. open forum thread fun deathly serious changes absolutely nothing. country still burning tomorrow either way.

This. sub batshit people come kids covid long haul covid mentioned. bananas. Show article 11 year old Arkansas dying Well, even couple weeks challenging given many healthcare systems requiring proof vaccination employees students.    Noem breathes sigh relief Agreed. feel little silly worrying child, sometimes wonder biggest (and quite selfish) worry he’ll go back school, catch mild case “remote learning” two weeks. Virtual school absolute shitshow last year, would really bad stop working 10 days whatever (self-employed). mention I’d wonder passed someone else school detected. 

I’m incredibly grateful kids super low risk. working parents, scenario involving symptomatic kids going scale difficult unthinkable. Given expecting 100k cases day right now, we're getting 30k still much better hoped for. anyone actually read article watched video, terrifying Florida gonna get much worse. charges using fake vaccine card show school ? bitch know currently half mind report school Home schooling become main stream like work home #myguess feel like different reality short time back, many shouting back normal stop fear mongering, told Delta variant watched? best hope children get sick. :( Pretty good! also quarantine sick. Yet many people view showing church (and work) sick badge honor. Like, no, dumb fuck, make good person, makes asshole, please keep illness yourself. Yeah think even used expensive house boats Europe. bolt couple side side onto barge boom new house move around water. Might concept design saw pretty American version Pfizer approved fully couple weeks (according experts). don’t see point trying fight disclosure issue approval coming soon. schools...  Good luck. Babies born Covid. seems much risky. FDA approval changes everything, someone’s rights currently disclose? somewhat impression employee ask vaccination status, seems less clear student status. Lol. really don’t know you’re talking it’s hilarious. One best easiest ways reduce Covid transmission antigen testing. pack tests home?

It's almost year since first at-home, fifteen minute antigen tests approved. tests retail $10 each.

Meanwhile, US, we're spending fortune PCR testing. We've spent nearly hundred billion dollars it, we're spending $150 million day.

There 120 million households US. could send every household two antigen tests $2.5 billion. USPS could deliver every address.

Nearly year approval, many manufacturers available, hard understand done yet. Exactly. need stronger safety net going continue prolonged lockdowns going endemic  Waiting Wake right thing next. assume waiting cases explode school say anything. But, Wake 600+ day now. think know reason really sad read stories unvaccinated dying, know keep sharing get others see importance getting vaccinated. Please please wake protect around late. Students disclosing vaccination status order live dorms decades. vaccines FDA approved excuse to. Unless plan providing pages medical proof can’t receive vaccine.

As employees, businesses always require share information. don’t want to, quit :) That's direct violation TSA mandates! Oy vey... there’s enough research done, we’re worried it’ll effect baby. Can't wait till get round galaxies. milky way variant sounds pretty cool Paywall people India rural population, minimum education. willing take vaccines. Highlight video top article: help folks understand mentality everyday ""Florida Man/Parent"" Shipping container houses terrible idea practice. Video details why.  doesn’t get vaccinated then? Pregnant women still get vaccine. want four doses none…. gotta keep em vaccinated. Federal workers lie anything face prosecution.   didn’t wish death anyone. actually says surveillance mgmt style company manager feel need employees.

It’s mentality “if paying much, sit ass Herman Miller chair minimum 9 hours day nitpick every time get take piss”

Pay want; good part educated population wise BS &amp; realize much money doesn’t buy happiness, hookers blow. Work life balance exposed far important cash.

Many take paycut; management adapt 1990s mentality managers retire/stroke out. Wow... Surprised interior pictures. Looks pretty decent. Ways better circa 1970s mobile home lived college.... Better rental college actually. One house rented interior walls like Styrofoam something. like stuff would go behind drywall. know go tap nail hang picture.   Congrats getting away 😬 Thanks MTG Fox! Here's latest 7-day running average case/death charts curves really impressive, especially last chart. That's pretty special results got going there.

It interesting see deaths track cases, relative previous waves. think would lot lower, given older people mainly vaccinated. maybe increased virulence Delta counterbalance that.

I guess they'll run experiment find empirically, using scientific method. Florida believes science. It’s possible. think 5+ sure ready then, 2+ probably around then, early 2022.   work EMS here; sympathy evaporated Thanksgiving wave hit Sure people I’ve seen long lines vaccines. town, people even got fight INC cos tagged VIPs ushered first. whole article listening government - else. science funded largely government. I'm suggesting they're paid entirely call spade spade conflict interest conflict interest. 

It's common sense wear mask respiratory illness, stay away people sick, wash hands, get vaccines. Around common sense, back forth nearly everything. science x, says y, right time sensible thing, before. I've done common sense dictates, gotten sick. I've done shit started stateside  definitely think could help people.  comment ""baaaaaaah""? What's point that? Lambda Lambda Lambda variant. catch turn Booger Snotty. think FloridaMan one generally stupid shit, danger rest society. DeSantis horribly mutated grotesque version FM   reflects I've personally seeing past year... work private environment, one-on-one young children. noticed broad spectrum mild severe delays/challenges socially academically, children caught autism spectrum special needs testing. I'm one person everything catch up.... :/   obvious along, way insist people getting vaccinated live fear virus. reality people already got vaccinated COVID reason got vaccinated flu year - caution. However, unvaccinated understand caution, filled unacknowledged fear. loudly assume everyone else driven fear well, way they're able express fear feel within themselves.  comment responded literally said can't force injection impose fine refuse get injected.

So what's point comment? 99% fine. rub. counter intuitive requires planning ahead instead thinking immediate surroundings. Everything looks normal people freaking it? Must bunch hyperbole think. exponential growth catches like everyone it.  stay safe too. Things get even worse aftwr weekend (Sold Hall Fame game, sold UFC Houston, etc.) Except that's looks like. can't link Israeli study reddit like source they're outbreaks among vaccinated unvaccinated..saying previously infected covid LEAST effected Delta reinfected.

Now could argue separating categories Vaccinated, Unvaccinated, Un-vax Prior Covid Antibodies, would find Un-vax Prior Covid Antibodies likely lowest total amount people. still seems there's something antibodies functional creating resistance close vaccine. probably figures voters spare. sacrificing gets intense support surviving supporters. certain point death, comes positive him.

So math problem. I'd guess could lose another 50k voters still get net political profit. good go work one hospitals while. Yeah pretty awful. Glad they're feeling little better. I’m vaccinated fucking moron. Holyyyy Go it, aren’t really jobs stopping crime around SF anyways sure they’re getting paid for. Sadly agree first amendment/title vii issue. damn time    Didnt already??  good, I’m aware lockdowns controversial don’t see way currently. I’d happy proven wrong. 

Glad see someone feels same, stay safe there.  unlikely small local businesses going employee mandates. Half probably anti-vaxxers anyway. US Military short order, US Military contractors [already mandates. saying dismissed contractor civil service jobs, they'll demand jobs back bullets. Disaster coming…..re-election attainable …just lot less living people vote 🙁 I’m guessing Canada doesn’t want us.  Neither Polio vaccine, mandated. Risk death, maybe. long term effects. seen studies show markers blood clots? studies show decreased grey matter density? 
Covid without consequences, even hospitalized. I’m fully vaccinated aware chance may still get it. done part I’m tired defending don’t see much political another lockdown. Vaxxed people don’t want lock necessary protect others. Unvaxxed people don‘t want lock ""just flu"" ""a hoax"". suppose it‘s minority overly cautious people want pursue path. Last checked, DeSantis pro-vaccine? pro-forced-vaccine... trying make actually is, isn’t rolling tanks cities control every aspect life. It’s stopping virus becoming problem already is. Nothing more. slippery slope.

Getting everyone vaccinated stop virus. countries world never reach full vaccination enable variants develop. Delta variant India 

Regardless, Covid isn’t going away. It’s going part foreseeable future. vaccinations seasonal. already evidence Israel UK (two highly vaccinated countries yet outbreaks delta) vaccine wears time. 

Zero covid cases isn’t tangible ever rolling restrictions hopes obtain never work. Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine today. precaution avoid fever, nausea, etc. nurse told paracetamol every 8 hours next 3 days. far good, I'm taking it, I've experienced sleepiness little pain arm. I've read paracetamol might affect immune response true one things ""well little evidence actually know"". Thank you. vastly underestimated number Jude Law's character would spreading lies making money employer permitted fire someone simply basis whether vaccinated, personal choice also protected matter medical privacy rights (HIPPA). employer right know anything regarding employee's private medical records, including whether taking particular medications vaccinations. Lots people prescribed drugs pain variety reasons may cause impairment, get fired using unless becomes problem ability perform job duties properly. Adderall? That's drug many would argue improves performance certain types jobs. 

In job, extremely rare anyone need see face, work online remotely.. could tattoo anything want face would make difference ability perform job. appearance none employer's business, long hair big giant beard, nobody cares, matter. time I'm working PJ's.    Yep, we’ll ignore ones life altering side effects focus death alone! /s

Grow up. continue let burn control, more, worse mutations occur current vaccines useless. nightmare scenario knuckleheads lead us without lockdown stronger leadership.

Edit: agree expounding. Someone downvoted you, me. 40 80 age group. still room improvement 18-29 (73%) 30-39 (81.2). Still, excellent  almost died child.. virus mutate vaccinated folks? vaxxed, asymptomatic carriers sound pretty terrible they're allowing mutate. well elderly parents. I'm confused, parents ""shitty parents"" sending thier kids school?  acknowledging reality i'm longer allowed upset loved ones die?  They're starting feel better now. think hardest part (other dealing fact kids got it) one parent negative trying keep giving them. parent caring kids alone. Shitty situation around.  ""we enough information, can't say work"" lying? erring side know now. correct, masks work world lot diseases, situations don't.

So either science says work, later retracts that, says work, turns don't, people put danger otherwise would have.

Neither would lying book, but, one could way damaging mitigation attempts.

Also, record, I'd listen science, government, diverge really start worrying. 93 deaths today, deaths trail cases higher soon. Thank you! Till alien lizard people find eat you.  vents? could said side. pro-vaccine family members exact thing anyone says vaccinated.   AKA ""The Spanish Flu"" 1918 still around today ""the flu"" - despite ""vaccination"" created! yep - heard it! Shhh - that's unpopular Covid eradicated it. stressed children wearing masks return school coming days.

To think schools even open. Many might surprised children start testing positive nationwide. Kids actually lives outside school too, can't really mandate masks kids playing friends. moral majority? people voted like him: give money!  Phase III original trial, got placebo fall. got shots unblinded. second shot Feb. 5 got call day got 6 month mark.  two criteria original Phase III (they kept blood draws going whole time) six months second shot.

If original trial, might luck. Pfizer talking booster trial would get reduced dose, full dose dose specific South African variant, know sure got ground available area regardless. guy created biohazard nightmare people Florida. hospitals start experiencing oxygen shortage Florida? Yeah short term effects proven significantly worse, pivot time future learn long term effects. Proud, angry he’s challenged decisions  Let's buy vaccine card spend 16K caught instead getting free vaccine!! Logic 🤪 Same. It’s disappointing. concur lockdown, vaccines great they’ve demonstrated can’t heavy lifting.  Jesus fuck. absolutely frightening, unknown. point people get charged reckless endangerment? Oh, got asked saying unnecessary? hope lifting legs move goalposts!

Facile pedantry works lot, bet.. here, today. 
You proven wrong can't/won't admit it; expect nothing less sort. ;)  Sure, wouldn’t died otherwise. say “dying *from* covid dying covid.” absolutely asinine reflect regular annual death tolls. SIGNIFICANTLY deaths normal then??

America’s fat, ain’t changing. least mandate vax life continue. 

Also survival isn’t everything. I’d rather alive paraplegic. I’m sure you’ll able parrot useless statistic easily ventilator. mention 98.8% world population 92 MILLION people.

[It's OK like  Here's real world, Manaus supposed natural herd immunity, still got hit P2 fair, alternative DeSantis [this came extremely close winning. OP say anything individual pharmacies shipping stuff UPS, talking expansion programs like long vaccines EUA 12+ America, I’d support mask mandates indoors places like schools. uni indoor mask mandate place, get it, significant political obstacles requiring vaccines among student population vaccine EUA approval. I’d say thing high schools school environments students 12+.

However, major vaccines achieve full FDA approval, think drop mask mandates institute vaccine mandate instead. Top epidemiologists, including Brown University’s Dr. Ashish Jha ), agree best way protect children pandemic adults older children around vaccinated, requiring vaccines places like high schools universities would help drive vaccination rate. It’s clear vaccines safe effective people 12+, soon it’s politically possible, need stop coddling concerns irrationally opposed vaccine. Additionally, vaccine mandate place, ought drop masks. Even though they’re also effective, they’re inconvenient, high enough population vaccinated, effect dropping mask mandate minimal.

For children 12, community spread low enough, see reason wear masks. clearly situation. Even though children low risk worst effects vaccine, still vectors transmission, would likely worsen spread community. things get better, hopefully won’t wear masks. course, they’re vaccinated, probably drop masks all. No, doc said fine. fact took interview request stupid person/subject. I’m guessing better things do. may feel compelled educate public, I’m guessing people still believe masks “germ catchers” far things won’t amenable education. Thanks spent quite time Twitter account brought hope. I've seeing bad news despite *knowing* vaccines effective there's always one little voice saying discouraging stuff comes pandemic. nice actually read factual good news. Thank you. delta variant symptoms well reported all. Cases I've heard recently started sore throat, patient reportedly worse sore throats allergies. G-Men show home needle hold inject you? pretty crazy. Conservatives love misunderstand personal choice ""Authoritarianism"". CHOICE work someone demanding vaccination. CHOICE attend school demanding children. CHOICE enter privately owned business demanding masks vaccination proof. opt out. 

&amp;#x200B;

But hey, want confuse ""I want X demand Z ""Forcing me"" that's right. Everyone right kind crazy entitled want be.  thought covid wasnt concern fuckin atodaso. Fuckin atodaso. Half people claiming covid getting vaccinated even go get tested, self-diagnosed.

Source? It’s great research question. We’d likely want look Rt value US vs Rt value place mitigation measures place roughly vaccine % prior level infection.

My hypothesis mitigation measures matter somewhat sustainable long term. matter variant, COVID going run wild population eventually due novelty. Good inventive, though coming bit incentive program comes little less month D.C. public schools reopen in-person fall semester, D.C. reports wide disparities youth vaccination rates.

Obviously takes time vaccinations effect, especially two shot vaccines. students 12 vaccinated present time Saturday, Aug. 7, roughly 55% D.C.’s population fully vaccinated, cases ticking since beginning July. city’s average daily case count 101, dramatic increase average daily case rate 10 reported beginning July.

10x month doubling every week half. That's kind dangerous rate we've seeing place. feel like much information vaccinated delta variant symptoms, let report anecdotally cases I've heard started benign sore throat. can't one massive coordinated lock like China did? UK, boosters next month already announced. Delta isn’t really resistant vaccines much seems reproduce much quicker create heavier viral load much faster. one gonna ban events again. People riot shut pays shot?  wearing black face photo? far see South American countries building production Countries also slowly worked build local production capacity. plant Argentina first full course locally produced Sputnik V doses approved quality week. Cuba exporting homemade vaccine Abdala Venezuela may soon send Bolivia, Brazil's Butanvac Mexico's Patria shots clinical trials. Wednesday, Chile announced plans build plant fill finish doses Sinovac's vaccine.

This probably good thing. Ideally middle income countries shoudl able help EU surplus doses go low income regions Subsaharan Africa. get cheaper boosters, also governments say ""You give us cost, banned market"". We’ve entered stage pandemic we’re allowed make decisions.

If they’re vaccinated, let party. Spoken like person who’s never China! True, friend telling tiktoc guy follows who’s wife basically dying needed emergency c section save baby she’s intubated he’s single dad newborn doctor advised getting vaccine , personally feel that’s horrible medical advise India actually listed article one ""the four major regions producing vaccines massive scale"". anything, situation provides counterpoint: vaccinate population exporting vaccines scale, led Delta variant.

I deeply appreciate fact India generous enough export vaccines time greatly needed. Canada receiving vaccines India long United States allowed exports. think accurate claim shipping vaccines elsewhere public health benefit exporting country reduces development variants. Nope. still get tested unless get vaccine. Blockchain advantageous there's trusted party guaranteeing ledger correct; blockchain source authority.

This absolutely case vaccination records, exist authoritative state health department databases. I’d quit focusing people predict let play out. ‘experts’ guessing putting much worry isn’t healthy. Utterly stupid! There’s bit seasonality play here. I’m bit cautious entering fall/winter. think need hit 70% total population (at least) fully vaxxed really get handle virus start approaching pre pandemic type normal, things change fast virus, knows next months hold? 

Just hope get boosters arms risk fall/winter. able keep hospitalizations deaths relatively low. Fingers crossed. UK, boosters given next month. familiar one. India far third world nation days. Sure, still fucked parts crazy traditional beliefs. they're modernizing fast.

I've traveled bunch, least developed nations world. Modern medicine ""thing"". tend favor ""traditional medicine"" ""spiritual healing"" solve problems.

Anyone thinking they're going get vaxxed significant numbers simply touch reality. get mocked called heathen many places trusting antibiotics witch doctors (usa) entire extended family indoor birthday party huge packed restaurant masks. crazy wildly irresponsible gathering cases increasing delta blowing through? see friends acquaintances going parties unmasked indoors stuff, insane locked paying people buttload cash stay home? Chinese vaccines does. proven Moderna Pfizer work still. festival. Pretty much everyone massive turnout. Austin Texas. Unfortunately kinda becoming California though. vulnerable groups vaccinated, absolute. Depending county 65+ anywhere 95 60 percent vaccinated. leaves lot people still among ""most vulnerable"" get it. Also Delta different anything seen change ""most vulnerable"" ""people risk"" longer looking 65+. 50-65 year olds, people comorbities like obesity, hypertension diabetes vulnerable. 65+ cohort vaccination rates take slump results lot people tbe potential hospitalized. top vaccination stuff, state fully reopened lack masking adherence, considerable effort made keep away. New York Seattle places US saw uncontrolled spread virus back April 2020 strain another level comes transmission.  start hurting feelings. Dr Moran says natural better Coronavac. think Indonesia discovered hospital staff getting infected Sinovac/Coronavac looking source mRNA vaccines 3rd shot. 

He says data vaccines recommends vaccination. Lol earth could random entertainment venue, example, get access state database filled medical information millions people?

Back March, NYS launching this. 
 opinion behavior huge factor people scared virus anymore. least, nearly much last year. Every single person see picture obese... Good luck many people dying? NJ afaik. long three liberals back up! They're absolutely spite people voted different them. I'm around enough people hear say, assuming everyone getting vaccinated medical reasons fear vaccine, majority along party lines spite. India cow dung story?   blaming mandates masks. blaming people. 

It's always people, whether masks lock downs vaccinations. bit good compare ""measures"" certain people cooperate them. is. live Alabama. post frequently vaccines vocally pro science. know two people messaged past weeks got vaccinated recently one posts. hope there's more. stop information spree there's much misinformation. people going go CDC website read scientific journals. get info social media that's we've gotta meet them. people would get vaccinated problems.  I'm sure would heard, people getting sick 3rd. Thousands must already. Weird decided hour show started everyone already gathered course extremely predictable widely predicted. Anytime document takes significant value, flourishing black market fake versions document immediately springs up. 

It's possible make documents resistant kind thing, course, difficult, takes long time, success uneven. Take look history driver's licenses, paper money, passports, credit cards.

Of course, wide availability faked vaccine certificates means concept can't trusted.

Vaccine certificates likely even difficult rapid changes situation. Different vaccine types, fading immunity time, different speedily evolving viral variants, different national regional laws add complex environment. works entire industry follows... know industry work in. one decides go grain would massive competitive advantage hiring standpoint. 

Not every solution works every team hiring issue going away.  CDC tracking breakthrough cases unless person hospitalized. 26% number, appears 18% now, population hospitalized only. used logic would mean 20% breakthroughs result death, meaning interpretation wrong. ER friend says he's seeing reinfections 3 months previous ones. Wes quit band years ago. talent entire band. BS...

When companies say 2 weeks get first shot, 8 weeks show fully vaccinated, come back, people get vaccinated.


When companies say insurance premiums going $200 month, vaccinated get $200 discount, people get vaccinated.


When colleges schools say can't show unless vaccinated, people get vaccinated. Yes. strange talking point lately. Saw one FB discussion local mask mandates schools. curiosity, much current wave US think driven behavior? I'm asking know Delta variant extremely contagious, judging Instagram feeds observations restaurants whatnot, there's ton opportunity virus spread. thoughts? think there's time redistribute vaccines countries (unless share border, suppose).  pretty much given point percentage population going refuse vaccine even kills them. might reachable, others less so. makes furious anything people creating ideal conditions vaccine resistant variants take hold spread around world. us vaccine available us morally bound take protect humanity.

So let's ignore moment. harder question whether allow local high risk population booster shot vs shipping doses countries low vaccination rates. take much problem distribution, logistics, costs. manufacture vaccine fairly rapidly (relatively speaking) cheaply. really hard distribute best (mRNA) vaccines remote areas given storage shipping requirements. Simply logistics point view far easier cheaper give people US booster shots try vaccinate large portions remote countries. mean try, think wise ""pause"" booster shots delta rages potential future vaccination countries may may work out. local high risk population seeing breakthrough cases also potential vector vaccine resistant variants. not.

One day March 2020, Rosemary Bily suddenly grew tired could barely get bed. “She slept lot,” said son-in-law Rich Lamanno. “She wiped month.” Ms. Bily, 86, also developed nausea diarrhea, along slight cough, subsisted mostly Tylenol Gatorade.

A days later husband, Eugene Bily, 90, started coughing became lethargic well.

Had family gathering days earlier, Bilys’s children would suspected new coronavirus. might blamed flu, simply advancing age. “What heard TV ‘high fever, can’t breathe’ — neither,” Mr. Lamanno recalled.

But dozen guests gathered restaurant Rockville Centre, Long Island, earlier month celebrate niece’s birthday, one one fell ill Covid, including Mr. Lamanno wife.

As symptoms spread, doctors told worried family Bilys likely Covid-19. tests short supply time, neither tested; family also feared taking overflowing local hospitals. subsequent antibody tests confirmed Eugene Rosemary Bily, live Oceanside, N. Y., contracted survived virus.

The population 65, vulnerable virus’s effects, got early start Covid vaccination highest rate country — 80 percent fully vaccinated. infections increasing more, hospitalization rising among older adults, large-scale new study Journals Gerontology provides timely warning: Covid look different older patients.

“People expect fever, cough, shortness breath,” said Allison Marziliano, lead author study. social health psychologist Feinstein Institutes Medical Research, part large Northwell Health system across New York State.

But researchers combed electronic health records nearly 5,000 people, age 65, hospitalized Covid dozen Northwell hospitals March April 2020, found one-third arrived symptoms, unexpected ones.

The team, searching records using language software, found one-quarter older patients reported functional decline. “This falls, fatigue, weakness, difficulty walking getting bed,” Dr. Marziliano said.

Eleven percent experienced altered mental status — “confusion, agitation, forgetfulness, lethargy,” said. half group atypical symptoms also suffered least one classic Covid problems — fever, trouble breathing, coughing.

“Clinicians know, older adults know, caregivers know: see certain atypical symptoms, could Covid,” Dr. Marziliano said.

The rate atypical symptoms rose significantly age, affecting 31 percent aged 65 74, 44 percent 85. symptoms occurred commonly women, Black patients (but Hispanics) chronic diseases, particularly diabetes dementia.

Because people atypical group less likely experience breathing problems require ventilation, less likely need intensive care. groups spent 10 days hospital, roughly one-third group died.

“These people hospital long,” Dr. Marziliano said. “Their mortality rate high. shouldn’t dismissed.”

The research mirrors findings other, smaller studies older people conducted early pandemic United States Europe. Covid outbreak nursing home Providence, R.I., instance, Brown University study found common symptom loss appetite, followed lethargy, diarrhea fatigue.

“We’re necessarily surprised this,” said Dr. Maria Carney, geriatrician author Northwell study. “Older adults don’t always present like adults. may mount fever. metabolisms different.”

Younger diabetics, instance, may become sweaty experience palpitations blood sugar falls, Dr. Carney explained. older person low blood sugar could faint without warning. Older people suffer depression may appetite loss insomnia necessarily feel sad.

In May 2020, Dr. Carney heard daughter worried mother, 80s suddenly grown weaker. “She didn’t fever cough, herself,” Dr. Carney recalled. Doctors local emergency room diagnosed urinary tract infection prescribed antibiotics, daughter reported. five days later, mother’s condition worsening. “She needs Covid test,” Dr. Carney advised.

Diagnosing Covid quickly older patients make world difference. “We things offer didn’t first wave,” said Dr. Eleftherios Mylonakis, chief infectious diseases Warren Alpert Medical School Brown University, led Providence nursing home study. “We better understanding, treatments, better support.”

Among improvements: using anticoagulant drugs prevent clotting using monoclonal antibodies (the treatment former President Trump received Walter Reed Hospital) strengthen immune system. But, Dr. Mylonakis added, “It’s paramount start kind treatment early.”

Understanding something vague weakness, confusion appetite loss might signal Covid infection also help protect friends family, isolate get tested themselves. “It helps individual, also contain spread virus,” Dr. Mylonakis said.

A Covid diagnosis also ward needless tests procedures. “We avoid unnecessary testing, poking prodding, CT scans,” Dr. Carney said. CT scans expensive, burdensome take time schedule analyze; nasal swab Covid quick, relatively cheap widely available.

With widespread vaccination, symptoms Covid-19 older adults may become even subtle. Fevers easy measure, difficulty breathing send anyone emergency room, Dr. Carney pointed out, whereas “we don’t necessarily notice someone stopped eating.”

Her counsel, older patients caregivers doctors, stay alert changes occur quickly, matter days. “When there’s change behavior, physical cognitive, may look like infection, keep Covid top list,” said.

The woman worried daughter indeed contracted virus; died hospital.

But Bilys pulled still live Oceanside split-level home. Mr. Bily contended many health problems even pandemic. past 18 months, underwent two hip surgeries several hospitalizations. June, began receiving home hospice care.

If scared vaccines masks stay home. I'm glad symptom-free!

Drop symbols us?  weather sucks it’s kinda cool warm winter you’re  opinion never becomes fault. nothing United States would ever encourage BIPOC believe government medical industry best interests heart. They've abused time time Tuskeegee Henrietta Lacks. Tuskeegee ended 50 years ago. That's long. infantilizing say communities endured hundreds years abuse experimentation would apprehensive get vaccine - especially constant misinformation campaigns designed breed distrust.

And never said hard get vaccine. said financial risk take time got symptoms work days. Plenty jobs tolerate call outs even sick/vaccine symptoms either way, missing days work hundreds dollars many families cannot spare. think that's true, clearly never experienced means lucky. 

Also wanted continue conversation would ask *you* one booking appointments low income family friends easy there's nothing stop, limit, discourage them. 

I arguing you. really want get people vaccinated educate medical abuse history, generational trauma, algorithms perpetuate pipeline disinformation. want convince people get vaccinated need good understanding aren't. 

If wanna get last word go it. going change mind here. reality. hear much good news Mississippi right now. Well done Ole Miss football! school around country successfully implement podding recommended Gottlieb article? school took lots precautions last spring, “podding” practically impossible. Lots lots shared spaces happening school mixing groups.

For instance: 5th graders finished maskless 30 minute lunch classroom instead cafeteria. would enter classroom 5 minutes later group second graders lunch would take masks off. aid ate lunch 5th graders never opened windows. would immediately open windows upon entering 2nd graders… get Omega variant, game over. makes wonder long it'll take unvaccinated people gain immunity infection instead.  difference UK US see relief here. That's sad way think! Symptoms reported start 2-14 days past exposure. So, seems possible. Florida weird one, though, huge number snowbirds/elderly. IIRC vaccines manufactured India authorized Indian government administered citizens. Yeah think someone hasnt vaccine yet considering logic. number says serious govt takes this. Like instance Googled passport fraud found this.

My option break law keep home safe guaranteed, send keep fingers crossed. left question unanswered... Actually trying find something kids school. n95s may difficult feel bad healthcare workers. It’s terrible now. Unfortunately seems like get much worse hospitals gets better. Yeah, year, even deadlier variant, safety precautions nearly nonexistent, fucking insane maybe first global example purely delta outbreak - good assessing transmission health outcomes. woken fact nothing changed Easter, Memorial Day, Election Day, Inauguration Day. addressing statement legal precedent forced vaccinations.  switch outrage towards hospital workers letting kids die.

I guarantee this.  disagree, ways dealing without bringing everyone classroom once. Removing safety measures made last year successful middle ground going work well contagious variant.  Lets focus getting vaccines want take it... many countries around world would love vaccination access numbers usa has. Sorry. think explained poorly. know promoting Covid parties. 

What trying say silly people would try avoid getting vaccinated getting sick. Buy KN95/N95, found reliable suppliers \~$1 mask, rotate dispose wear \~40 hours. masks static charge traps tiny particles, wears much better permanently reusable mask. video explains science behind it: say? dumb comments removed? I'd like read feel happier knowing dumdums like around, comparison makes smarter. They’ve already begun trials children, FDA requiring four six months data, whereas required two months data adult trials.  Well that’s going happen. Him, people? must've forgotten, this? mandates best possible solution, [why Council Europe pass resolution urging member states keep vaccines voluntary use vaccine certificates tool monitor efficacy potential side something goes wrong virus, mandates could well erode public trust future vaccines, like problems MMR vaccine eroded Japan's trust. sure do. everyone’s health one size fits all. wishing upon them. arrogance self-righteousness doesn’t make correct matter badly believe it. result choice ultimately may new variant present vaccines effective against. Maybe within months. guess okay though, price freedom ? probably right. close family says it, seen posts here, that's also anecdotal, personal experience guess. 

To clarify, think FDA approval something people use excuse *actually believe.* impossible argue approved, think that's say it.

I would genuinely love wrong, see giant spike vaccinations. Sky Club included?   let calculate it. choose activity somewhat similar doing, asks clarifying questions determine much risk compared risk tolerance looking Hes asshple. Residents need take responsibility, get vaxxed, mask up, stay home.
Don't need mandate justify making decisions.
Not defending means, exhausting seeing people live life usual unless governor tells otherwise. Better play safe sounds whole lot like lying public. able keep story straight since start.

That's info useful before.  I'm children gladly pay taxes schools. increases property value makes better, nicer, compassionate place live. get vaccinated.

Vaccines teach body produce Covid anti bodies. got vaccinated would wider set anti bodies. going lie say Delta different risk level children there's point arguing you.  Sure, people crazy, cares. Ultimately, elected officials override public emergency; always. propaganda course strong sides keep people docile. Copy/pasted elsewhere death rates since June. That's want know

There 444 COVID-19 deaths Alabama since June 1st. (11,600 - 11,156)

If assume 26 vaccinated people died part 444 (which unlikely) means least 94.1% people died unvaccinated.

You think 94% nearly all?

Hell, even count July 1st still basically 9 10 dead minimum unvaccinated.

222/248 = 0.895 = 89.5%  beds “floors” aren’t useless. Beds floor patients undertaking undertook elective surgery. ES cancelled, yes, beds taken patients still recovering, majority beds free. beds used. nurses shouldn’t let go transferred ICU help “influx ICU patients”.

I’ve floors, majority beds aren’t filled patients like ICU is

They wouldn’t getting way, ICU influx patients, nurses would logically needed Slippery slope guys!!! government makes law, make even laws!!!! Oh no!!!! Thats people's choice semi-free capalistic society...

Delta still COVID, ""new"" disease. assertion Delta hits ages unlike OG COVID another claim requires strong evidence back up.

Also take account moment, 85-90+% 75+ vaccinated, means much much less likely suffer harshly infection. see ""Kids/youth make larger share hospitalization used to"" headlines, consider fact. elderly relatively unvaccinated kids are, they'd probably packing hospitals like back 2020. 288 kids 0-18 died covid u.s Cases deaths vaccination status still displayed date charts original virus even exist anymore? supposed satire?

There plenty misinformation there, ain’t it. difference interesting. Cases falling peak 5 times smaller previous peak January. They’re getting vaxed less red areas still getting hit way worse blue areas. don’t think they’re “decimated” Selective pressure absolutely applies viruses. doesn’t matter whether meet criteria life. genes. genes influence phenotype. Phenotype influences reproductive success. certain sequence confers reproductive fitness advantage, relative frequency increase. think delta become predominant variant? wasn’t random chance, rather genetic makeup confers fitness advantage. Mutations arising (as mutations, whether virus living organism) always random. Whether mutations become less frequent population random depends influence fitness. consider getting second test done? first one came back negative I've sick well week. There’s even political party people 😂 Nah it’s Florida Florida. Sorry, “don’t think hurts” constitute strong argument. Much better directing doses unvaccinated people without natural immunity. It’s delta contagious fewer people taking precautions, percentage-wise, kids seriously ill, tins kids infected still makes decent amount serious illnesses.

Therefore low priority triage. OP, use. believe wearing masks 10 years later? 50?

The virus ain't going away long people. Plus like third sentence:

*To clear, indication sort vaccine failure. Quite contrary*

People need stop blaming media giving information. Ignorance bliss. seems like effort get Democrats leave state leaving unreasonable republicans left. It’s 26%. don’t know much more. dont care want old frail parents get boosted. everybody household i’m 100 percent disabled cant get vax. guess don’t understand viewpoint. know infected spread COVID you’re vaccinated (hence CDC’s announcement masks week), however it’s somewhat unknown exactly level protection vaccines afford infection, particularly 6 months +. 
What isn’t disputed vaccines offer extremely high level protection severe illness death. COVID-19 clinical update #74, Daniel Griffin covers infections vaccinated individuals, expansion Regeneron monoclonal antibody cocktail prophylaxis, neutralization variants antibodies produced infection vaccination, longer hospital stays associated remdesivir treatment, post-acute sequelae infection impact quality life 1-6 months illness. Never heard Triage, eh?

I suggest looking up.

Being unvaccinated means lower chance survival. Therefore low priority list. see media continues COVID’s biggest cheerleader. Absolutely correct. Even data, author's framing utterly bizarre.

We literally polling showing vaccinated people worried COVID unvaccinated people. problem talk break-through infections enough?

Wut?? love Durham would say 90% people see shopping wearing masks. Wake county much different - hardly mask wearing all. definitely least socially distance trades. worked primarily alone Low Voltage Install, Precision Electrical Instrumentation tech. Concrete get distance too. apparently 70% vaccinated might enough herd immunity anymore. Fuck. know pregnant couples told quarantine 2 weeks baby comes since hospitals (were?) testing got admitted testing positive restrictions attached would follow that? 10-14 days know sf offering boosters jj people. havent anything else. Magic Gathering ever do? Yo think automod drunk make political statement Yup. easy lie go 'it's bit, arms still skinny even bad' etc. know experience. journey we're going get there. biggest trick finding something body loves much mind does. crazy intense ball busting work out, long commit enjoy it'll change fucking life. great one dude. numbers posted CDC. specify they’re tracking: Breakthroughs detected hospital. way misleading, unless can’t read? Wow! Truly Deathantis… don’t think many votes runs president. kind parent want kids mask. Well done! “But but… it’s hasn’t long. long-term affects. lack data”. — idiots Good. Get felony can’t vote Thanks source. That’s lot thought. due respect, may familiar current reality food service jobs. paid 2-day vaccine holiday would helpful. There's way could worked day shot.  Glad help! It’s unclear media late vaccine evasion far Pfizer Moderna still work. That's good hear! Thank you! 💖 think don’t staff Thank you, too! Obviously obese know 'healthy', Covid huge wake call finally make change stick it. rough want comfort eat lol realizing counter productive definitely helps. Things open, people need wear masks shops things, majority do. Still one way systems operations shops, still shops limits. pre-covid normal, pretty close. Lots travel destinations accept rapid tests long printed/emailed resident available. example, many countries EU require testing upon entry accept either PCR rapid   away couple weeks, leaving (when delta slightly less concern) would say around 90% people masked public (indoor) areas.

Actually recall shocked news reports came Seattle 70% vaccinated still considering jerks people wearing mask supermarkets. think it’s indication average American scared restrictions coming back virus.

Once media started talking like back panic mode return restrictions inevitable, people rolled sleeves. need take PCR test September 25th CANNOT positive. think start self-quarantining ensure get covid before? I'm fully vaccinated want make SURE test positive day. Ah yes, GOP base swayed statistics facts. /s probably talk mobile phone companies issue unique phone numbers. variants get hand techniques may come handy. I’d hope Abbott would watch Florida see threatening defund schools done little. School districts still putting mask mandates giving Desantis middle finger. RIP Apollo Creed That's really good take resource thank you! said knew true capacity manufacturing, that. Let's remember China country producing vaccines, bruh. Thank explaining! band good, Fred Durst that's ehh California, Mississippi. worship? redditors UK, life actually back “old normal” lot people still masking avoiding crowds?

Asking jealous yankee I’m boat, got shots December January. I’m heading vacation season (I go kids school) I’m thinking get booster. doctor said asked. I’m fine wearing masks vacation, I’d feel lot better added protection booster. population 2.3 million, Austin total 483 ICU beds across hospitals.

So, may sound scary headline says 6 beds left, is, problem enough beds covid.

And 18 months living COVID hospitals added ICU beds. problem solved money? Like example I'm willing pay triple booster shot -- basically every shot get, Moderna afford buy two shots someone Africa.

Or problem beyond money -- like there's enough raw materials world make booster shots first world nations first two shots third world countries?   either lying haven’t really talked friends last two weeks. DeSantis said. “Well, tell Florida, parents going make decision.”

This stupidest statement. allowing parents make decision kids, kids sitting next them, teacher, various school employees. Parents get ""right"" decide clothes kids wear school, would think good idea.

Let parent make decision. Vaccinate kid keep home. they're young vaccinate, mask keep home.  point.  probably 3-4 weeks surge go, India/UK/Indonesia's data relied on. wonder Texans long enough memory next year. hand, antivax mob probably less likely get tested. Yeah, makes sense. 12.9 billion vaccines seem pretty astronomical number donations fact, well, let us see enough protect countries need end year even small percentage. Stay e-scooters! church accountable idiocy individuals. Nobody accountable except individuals themselves. Many population still vaccinated - US. met people? Fear mongering best! think ahead!!!! /S Jim: So, doc, what's result? 

Doc: Well Jim, i've got good news bad news. results cancer came back negative. I'm afraid cancer positive. I'm truly sorry. 

Jim: aladeen? Better keep random fans happy look wellbeing, right?  watched it, made remember think Durst sucks ass. Christianity valid religion ""mainstream"" religions seems be, like community basic christian church, whatever largest/most broad-based synagogue mosque temple area is- sort integrated congregation is, line rest society.  4 months lagging, India catches US vaccinations situation sucks, probably best way forward nothing, there's known exposure. harm testing course. wrong. governments everywhere realize killing youth instead oldsters, might wake grieving nation's people rise eat them. republics

I’m sure that’s term want using…  feel sorry kids parents' bad judgement voter id security, yes. supporting vaccine passport safety? idea you’re saying? really pro-big gov?

giving government new power backfire president don’t agree comes office. you’ll wished secured elections given much.

but that’s democrat way. obama getting rid super majority senate really backfired boogeyman republican gets office. lack interest, really? wrote people dementia sickest sick. Which, wrote true.

Yes, people dementia hard hit covid. that's advanced age, dementia. correlation, causation. Ngl I'm kinda jelly sell us (Italy), we've short supplies months.  reason young single, fully vaxed guy like ""afraid"" delta variant? China country producing vaccines, bruh.

No shit!  probably due self-loathing leading wanting Daddy government control every aspect life can’t make Yes, masks required everyone (public school district Massachusetts). compliance issues heard about, occasional reminders ensuring good fit. 

Snack outside possible. lunch, cohorting spacing kids out, seemed work well. Nobody family even cold October March last year. also once-weekly pool testing spring semester, ~5 Covid cases among school community, evidence in-school transmission. 

Delta change game, course- least degree difficulty- extent (IMO) give previous mitigation measures 100% effective. never 100% effective, every bit helps. That’s tough. probably could guess, don’t necessarily agree testing requirement vaccinated people— it’s lot time subsequently money lost waiting. 

I understand we’re unprecedented times mitigation required, struggle see ever get cycle breakthrough cases— rare mild may be— exist. Obviously, go read reviews, “younger” lolla attendees artists. attendees shocked good Limp Foo Fighters were. definitely boost bands. Yet parents church central Florida (Faith Assembly) required masks social distancing since began. It’s huge church ton people, ton events, ton individual clubs weekly meetings. recently start 9 mask service, everything else masks/no social distancing.

I wonder miracle one catching covid going packed church weekly maybe church doesn’t disclose members catching covid.

Don’t get wrong, much I’ll fault this, one thing give credit much community. bunch food/supply drives, volunteers help around house/mow lawn/fix stuff (where possible) sick elderly, electric bill similar need help apply they’ll help out, etc. 

But, midst delta variant ravaging Florida can’t alright stance covid protections. It’s going fun watch exodus. Tots pears don’t let door hit ass. I’m Mississippi. know feeling well. actually makes wonder many breakthrough cases actually unvaccinated people carry fake cards. even way track that? wished everyone cared fellow man (or woman) much you. masking .....you're saying housing housing homeless bad thing???

Live let live correct? best chance protection everyone masked, perfect better nothing. Unvaccinated people victims stupidity (contextualized US countries universally available vaccines, obviously), problem also makes indirectly killers people.

In point view, see much viruses living things. virus behaves *like* living creature, technically object. Sars-CoV2 particles boxes. Boxes RNA receipt makes organism go nuts encounter airways. Many ways counter virus, vaccine.

Accepting people go infecting, literally accepting drop possibly lethal objects onto people, objects make organism go nuts (infected), process repeats.

The virus feets walk own, ours. wings, way replicate without host. Excluding infections animals, infections across humans 100% preventable depending efforts spent it. Human behavior indifferent epidemic less epidemic virus is. People literally helping offering way harm. virus excuse sentient, people not. 

I'm ashamed humanity, least societies kill shit people refuse so. I'm optimistic faster. Part approval process, part manufacturing. 

Approval: FDA wanted 4-6 months additional data 5-11 vaccine. may decide want even followup data under-5 vaccines, want wait trials completed. 

Manufacturing: Teenagers could get vaccinated quickly approval could use vaccine adults; serum, dose. Kids 5-11 hopefully able use serum, though dose may different. 

For under-5s, especially under-2s, less likely they'll able use serum adults. creates big ethical conundrum: Given world still desperately short adult vaccine, much mRNA manufacturing capacity shift adult vaccine young child vaccines? also run contractual issues want start producing child vaccines current orders adult vaccines fulfilled. 

Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe everything line we'll able get even babies vaccinated Christmas. I'm going bet best case scenario this. Sorry. I've seeing lot ""Biden sending illegals Mexico covid positive Florida!"" shit lately. 

I'm sure especially I've never Florida feel like probably mistaking Cubans Mexicans. everyone trying force us adopt rent month model, good investors vaccinated you’re pretty safe severe reactions. Congrats! yes, shit. social media influenced everything. source problems, though.  True, actually offer BCG kids. unreal somewhere like Hawai'i TB issue, requires kids vaccinated sorts, including chickenpox, choses vaccinate TB. Deranged.   read article? from? I'm suspecting paywall region specific. I'm SEA region. coworker got covid attending Sturgis rally last year. three weeks headed back year. stupid. “You make people something dont want to”

So assume vaccinations schools universities? laws?  tragedy. Preventable. Prayers family friends miss him.

It political. virus care party. kill anyone. 

And every death place statistic, excess death. causes people say frequent still still happen. extra cause death here, preventable.

Conservatives: Get vaxxed. Pres. Trump did, proud Operation Warp Speed got us vaccines record time. Honor accomplishment.    Let’s say you’re right. government shouldn’t able force inject something freedom.

All freedoms limitations. One sacred freedoms, speech, press, regulated. freedoms limited harm others. Freedom speech hits limits around harassment, example. freedom harms another, freedom loses. bodily autonomy limited punching others, another example.

Vaccination isn’t special, regard. Freedom body limited harm others. coronavirus purely personal issue, would conflict. However, coronavirus public health issue choice get vaccinated (freedom) Hasan negative impact *cannot* get vaccinated (public harm). Historical precedent actually makes case public health override personal freedom.

Allowing debate freedom, externalised consequences remaining unvaccinated massive harm public perception.

Vaccines aren’t personal freedom issue; they’re public health issue. Get vaccinated.  Yet one gonna say anything that, know, bunch college-aged kids everyone else *soooooo badddddd.*   Unless Florida, get finding withheld stuff like that. older 50. Kids getting sick delta. bunch kids died week. /r/Masks4All great advice (sorry kids myself)  Well yes agree. case mandates basically restrictions access services incentives.

I’m sure hadn’t talked doctor. don’t know even doctor. would think *any* children dying would cause concern unnecessary. people make sick. matter exposed, much exposed to. Inoculant load important- less better. yes, wearing mask (a good mask, little cloth things), distancing, handwashing, etc make difference still :)  Meanwhile Ontario Canada population 15 million 300 daily cases. 1-2 deaths. doesn’t include cases like 6 year old. Tested positive home 9 y/o got it. victims. willfully ignorant constantly try justify positions constantly twist excuses ""logic"" so. I've seen people say ""I'd rather die free live gov telling do!"" ""pro life"" people okay kids dying Delta political points.

See Dutch mink farms studies hamsters infected test mask efficacy sources. makes complete sense  exactly, sad people cant read get data shows vaccines working great. People focusing much cases matters hospitalizations deaths.

Vaccination dont prevent hospitalizations deaths greatly reduces them.

And people shouldnt worry 85% hospitalizations Israel fully vaccinated, thats basic maths: vaccination=eventually cases vacinated number overall way down, less 1/10. look Israel, barely 1 death/day. Stupidity greater pandemic. report past week lists 134,506 175 deaths. 

It seems like report deaths reported ***and*** occurred past week. they're missing majority deaths due reporting lag.  decides reckless selfishness is. Obesity costs healthcare system billions year.

Alright can't prove purposely misled reader. what's benefit comparing months vaccinated data 17 months non-vaccinated data? much useful stat compare past two months, normalize data determine effective vaccine is. That's people interested in.

Which ya, btw still clear getting vaccine super effective. seeing giant number next small number going mislead people. caught couple seconds. Maybe I'm idiot kid gets Covid, you’ll wish deal snotty mask instead vent. don’t understand people’s short sightedness. It’s crazy! shitshow. hospital cases could virtually zero.

Getting rid unlikely trivial vaccinating 7 billion humans period time shorter however long takes virus evolve vaccine evasion. tradition. replied right above. fucking dumb man be? leg room think pandemics politics don’t mix. clue  CDC think enough lifted federal mask mandate, hoping incentivize antivax. We're living aftermath ""underthinking"" now. 

It's ""overthinking"" anticipate antivax defiant enough get fake vax card. come ironclad solution. That's way get this. Karma. Yawn... idea about... seem empty.... Lots cops hate working SF.

Yeah, it’s already established anti-vaxxers reasonable would trust info even given accurately. mean, agree everyone informed much possible, think issue right anti-vaxxers hesitation vaccination less health experts disseminated info time emergency, general skepticism science making people ill-equipped receive info.

Lol lawful think getting EUA EULA mixed up. Congratulations! You’ve found exception rule! We're fully ""back normal"" except requiring masks inside

Pooled testing case updates included sure. Unfortunately online classes work parents unemployed able shell full time nanny day. absolutely agree mandated vaccines.

Of course thousands thousands cases kids, prove deadlier time goes on. really loss logical path forward here. Modern society complicated usual pandemic coping skills. different, fucking dipshit. Polio 30x deadly minimum. Y’all Variant America’s winning. vaccinated people get covid still transmit others, ppl vaccinated, less chance transmission overall. sure we're widespread Delta hospitalization right US, I'm quite sure point is.

My point wrong UK hospitalization specifically. UK extremely high immunization among vulnerable groups. unvaccinated population largely constrained under-30s. such, hospitalization much much smaller might expected based daily case rate. Feigl-Ding right concerned case numbers actively lambasting people confidence UK's high immunization rate vulnerable populations would result hospitalizations. Indeed, exactly happened.

Quite specifically, I'm giving example Feigl-Ding wrong Delta outbreak UK. wrong this. Hospitalizations never reached critical numbers predicted.

In US, immunization much worse. Delta ripping communities immunized. Many vulnerable populations remain completely unprotected political propaganda country fucking nightmare. think Feigl-Ding right concerned happen regarding hospitalizations here.

He often correct says. frequently hounds people disagreeing even though may good foundational reason disagree (as UK immunization rates effectively mitigating huge Delta numbers). Get vaccine Natural Self-selection It’s law, binding agreement. Giving third doses could subject facility lose vaccines fined.  Pro-vax arguments sound like pro-life arguments..

""I'm right *you* support killing people"" know joking actual Funeral home hospice companies invest stock market. people wear seatbelts good idea - people think seatbelts good idea they've gone front windshield. I’m wealthy woman certainly trust it. never want leave house guess really need vaccinated. HIPPA *medical* companies divulging medical information others. tell 3rd party medical info they’re mot medical company share whoever want.

Employers don’t “right” know medical history, aka divulge certain things free will, make divulgence requirement employment.

Again, *you agreeing* abide policies order work them. *rights* involved here. Rights things government cannot take away you, nothing happens enter contract private party. understand cerulean blue surrounded people not.

I understand people rockers.

I dispute they're going pull weapons roll Raytheon whoever main contractors supporting local base ready blast got laid off. 

Menacing someone porch who's asking vaccination status (which happen) very, different threatening government contractor employer, scale consequence going clear even mouth breathers. know family 3 times 9 months… still think immune now, holiday… world crazy… Yeah. Shit. apologies. Mental illness mean anti-vax. would say certainly applies way around though.  say rather stabbed, blown beat death first one? Sadly think multiple entities fit criteria.   whole point we're gonna get eventually. difference vaccines keeping us hospitals Id take guess alot people rapid antigen tests typically sensitive enough show positive results symptoms begin. people typically infectious two days symptom onset ...... Well explains it. 

This CDC allows PCR tests ""early release"" quarantine.  Chicago lowest test scores country. assure it’s Republican school system Can’t smell taste since last December read history vaccines things change, stay same. kind people demand schools pages pages dress codes. be...The Military REQUIRES vacines manner diseases, ensure ready deploy.   Who's they?    survive last show? *laughs Texan* mean drive 10 hours??? Ina book reading pushback people getting tetanus vaccine. really vaccine causing method injection. Still people believed it. gave fucks back would go house house forcing people get vaccine.   “Shove ass”

A real mature response.

“Na schools make decisions”

What schools dont demand students vaccinated?  Offer health care incase get side effects. Sure, they’ll give vaccine free, already poorly operating heart gives out, I’m fucked.  call Natural Selection See ya bye. People’s poor decisions lead people’s deaths. That’s logic simply Doesn’t work.

But America doesn’t teach us think critically things Nope, actually seen (in students' permanent file) multiple hand written notes parent school board saying child going forced get vaccinations. Often, little letter parent it. I've seen student's files before, yes, child unvaccinated. kind law can't actually enforced. kind like go anywhere (putput, anything could somehow dangerous, way hospital surgery) sign waiver hoping 99% people dumb enough think, 'well damn lost foot can't sue signed waiver'. absolutely sue win. 'laws' actually laws. That's stand court. Zones: Weekly Deaths Capita Heat Map Florida Longer Reports County Mortality Data)*

How convenient Florida 🙄 census wrong. news give context high covid hospitalization site said covid patients locally  Tennessee, schools open last year.


Maybe infants toddlers avoid RSV Covid again. Since avoid it.


Until time get vaccinated least Covid. worry RSV Covid. Executive summary: know much lambda all, we're worried laid waste Peru. New Jersey, New York, Mass, RI.

Guess win? 12 - Online vaccine tested. 

Over 12 - Vaccinations required class learning. vaccinated online learning. 

What think going happen? know teacher vaccinated (as school personnel). second day fixing classroom told someone tested positive Covid. Likely breakthrough case. tested immediately. happens kids there? Keep mind breakthrough case transmit virus others.     Nope.

Also untested: long term impacts COVID. Longest examples got even two years old. there's plenty reason think long term impacts disease much worse long term effects vaccine. Anecdotal, interesting sure. Thanks sharing! name single instance vaccine taking year manifest side effects? Okay, respect point view. Since it’s Sunday dawned church bad. data, afaik, indicate death rates since widespread vaccine availability. Information saw elsewhere, unfortunately can't recall where, showed data indicating blacks hispanics %'s getting vaccinated similar percentage overall population. expect may vary sharply region places south getting hammered overall vaccination rates lower southern states, expect they're lower black hispanic Americans states well. Unfortunately ""experts"" make soapbox, twist facts lately push agenda whomever provided soapbox. entire separate section US codes EUAs. good example fact twisting news stating headlines ""EEOC says employers require vaccination"". Well, EEOC law stating employers can't require EUA drug, also law stating could require either. fact is, EEOC decide addressed government elsewhere. Anyway code 21 USCS 360bbb-3(e)(1)(A)(ii)(III)  guess thing everyone running around stating facts vaccine requirements, forget talking EUA drug, people refer vaccine. month ago could said pandemic over, exists pandemic. point, pfizer would lost EUA would illegal administer shot point forward. instead paying people get shot. true pandemic need news tell existed.

EDIT: thank normal discussion. Pretty sure replied reasons people asked. U.S. slowing since April way early slow down. clear gap would closed. lead headstart Absolutely, remember 7 100k frightening last year. Yeah dumb ass parents make sense bitching get another vaccine. HOnesly

The weight politics misinformation 
Politics weighed immunization process, like many apolitical priori aspects American life. Race, religious ideas level education show clear differences level inoculations. survey carried July YouGov collaboration Economist shows, example, probability person vaccinated rural areas almost 10 percentage points lower average, explained lower risk perceive due less accessibility distribution centers. Still, according statistical model, biggest predictor whether average American got vaccinated whether voters Donald Trump Joe Biden.. 13 points less likely former vaccinated 18 points less likely latter have. 
Epidemiologist Susanne Straif-Bourgeois University Louisiana School Medicine especially blames misinformation social media. ""They read things like harm fertility women, pregnancies, true,"" laments. Pastor Spell one explosive anti-vaccine spokesmen, religious extremists, represent bulk population yet gone injection. people doubts. changed minds week seeing state news across country new major focus contagion. Brandon, practitioner one capital's pharmacies, corroborates this: ""I noticed many people coming days, vaccinating 20 people day."" Jackie, 71, waiting turn Friday morning. son died covid last year. think many drugs never even heard given put medically induced coma. painfully stupid people.

Louisiana, 47% adults complete regimen, 55% injected first dose and, thousand requests authorities, millionaire draws 616,000 deaths throughout country , who, like Scott Dowell, he's planning it.

The queues receive injections seen beginning pandemic stadiums big cities seem like another world piece America, hardly anyone seen vaccination centers. population 4.6 million inhabitants, registers average 4,600 cases per day, 99 per 100,000 inhabitants, highest ratio United States. 
The political dispute progressives conservatives - former inclined restrictions latter suspicious public intervention - also manifested inoculation process. governor state, Democrat John B. Edwards, already vetoed three bills state House, Republican majority, sought prohibit different measures require stimulate vaccines. Franciscan Missionaries Lady hospital network, largest state, issue order staff vaccinated coming months, laziness doubts reach sector itself.

Republican politicians, too, begun reinforce pro-vaccine message months little enthusiasm issue.

It’s decision affects spill people. powerful stories I’ve seen last weeks covid deniers panicked end lives. families pleading others get vaccinated wear mask wrong.

Sadly, think many stories available certain networks. cynic thought, ‘Of course, it’s hurting bottom line.’ Social distancing mask wearing matter large groups people gathered indoors hours time. Especially Delta.

I'm sick people acting like April 2020 know SARS-COV-2 airborne. ""Well social distanced washed hands spending day inside building dozens people still got it!"" Yeah, shit. knew couple people liked party them. didn’t friends didn’t intention attack I’m fed up. people I’ve spoken mention actually alluding reinstating lockdowns tougher, 2020 level restrictions never accept . Sorry assumed. read healthy people dying vaccine? read article. would mind posting? added benefit isn’t “murky”. clear benefit whether personally know not. enough doses people States. 

Again, quite literally created strong argument getting vaccinated lol. obviously don’t children fully vaxxed friend currently covid said like bad head cold shortness breath. Today feeling sneezy.

This doesn’t sound bad. I’d accept symptoms vaccinated person.

I caught H2N3 (or H3N2) years ago. use benchmark breakthrough infection. it’s worse that, I’m extremely concerned. it’s bad better, I’m willing accept live life. empathize situation. right things still ended wrong consequences. really easy look back try figure could done better avoid consequences, sometimes nothing could done. 

Despite extremely careful catching covid (I left house exactly 6 times year; always double masking) caught Covid day went get first vaccine. developed long covid looking like developed myocarditis. I'm early 30s also great health this. I'm fatigued I'm bed bound quite often. first months, really struggled coming terms unfairness circumstances. incredibly hard accept always fully control happens us.

I hope come peace realization regardless consequences, right thing. everything I've heard cardiologist, pericarditis/myocarditis usually temporary. Yep, fuck FDA, slow, got booster, ain't working covid units, get sick, first march 2  Math certainly strong point  Wow that’s church? Looks like opening mall (maybe repurposed? hearing ghost malls thanks Amazon) several non mRNA vaccines like traditional vector vaccines. Don’t forget thank special group governors. Then: forbids COVID ill person get attended hospital unless pays thousands dollars per day.

That would madness move.  Saban pretty good Covid issues throughout pandemic including rare PSA type commercial state. pushing 100% right now. sure, vaccinated people likely asymptomatic less likely tested too? 

Don't think straight comparison go already available traditional vaccine? mRNA concern? Douchantis!!! Maybe rumors Anti fa spreading Covid, would get vaxxed cotton masks draped across chin pandemic theater. Efficacy real masks Delta compared prior strains also dropped half

It possible even get high quality ""9502 ffp2 NR"" ""kn95"" masks. serious protecting it! Men: shaving wearing high quality mask important, otherwise bother, miss facial hair masks seal shit busted razor it. 

Everyone: use flexible nose-bridge create good seal, also help keep glasses fogging. one ""ear saver"" clips ear-loop masks, ear loop mask become adjustable comfortable. 

Personally use Powecom 9502 FFP2 NR (headband style 94% efficient) good old disposable ""surgical"" mask that, use adjustable ear saver keep surgical one bit looser FFP2 get pressed on/squished. adjustable nose bridges masks means glasses get zero fog.

If fully vaccinated wearing high quality mask CORRECTLY, nothing theatrical it. 

Vaccines work.

Masks work.

Think &amp; protect yourself.

Edited: words Well, beginning August lot universities scaled classes summer, little hard say. United States universities person generally planning fall Yeah, protected classes may necessary 50 years ago black man could go town full racists refused service everywhere. Nowadays, think free market handle issue.

In short, protected classes necessary past outlived usefulness today drives legal wedge Americans. deaths **not** related vaccine. It’s CDC wanted reported. It’s people died *and* vaccinated. Good you, I'm confident that's wise decision learn confidence made right decision well. counties elementary school- last year 5.5% positivity=mask mandate, staggered pick up/drop off, lunch classes, distancing everywhere, visitors, multiple prevention's place. + virtual option

School starts Tuesday, Positivity whopping 27%- last week set record cases hospitalizations county= masks optional, Cafeteria used lunch, normal pick drop off, ""We try"" distance, preventative measures removed. + virtual option removed.

Far less protections, far worse version virus.

Yes, once-in-500-year flu comparable. said “we don’t lock every year flu”. makes zero sense. flus live right nowhere even close comparable Covid. it’s bad argument can’t ruin economy society shelter small minority. Give work home study remotely options. can’t upend society 97% please minority.

That’s fair position.

All said personall worried letting massive, plague-ridden country start streaming Quebec already beginning fourth wave. know vaccinated people transmitting virus massively, worry lead bad things. 

You disagree risk assessment. Downvoting saying “hurt durr vaccines work” that’s counter specific worry shitty. bullshit argument RW started making week ago, cases spiraled control Florida, Texas, Alabama elsewhere. They're trying blame traditional RW scapegoats (blacks, Hispanics, illegal immigrants) surges, illnesses deaths governors talking-heads actively fought precautions for. Maybe name variants dinosaurs? op Ed networks Single vacinated: completely agree you, don’t know many downvotes. Birthday parties absolutely necessary things right now. Scaling back it’s still hundreds still terrible idea. pandemic shown selfish 99% people are. sucks, can’t un-know kind thing. I’ll never look people way Fine, perhaps nurses... constellations used up? potentially actual result, seems marred (i.e., motivated reasoners like consider pandemic vaccinated people sympathy unvaccinated adults still care) couple key exclusions:

A) breakthrough deaths? not, can't really care. Get sample size big enough expected value significantly zero, enough good smaller studies meta-analysis deaths done. Otherwise, takeaway vaccinated people arw safe deaths unvaccinated encountering consequences bad choice.

B) Mesa whole bunch J&amp;J instead much better MRNAs? difference efficacy could easily explained that. Also, since Mesa low vaccination rates, might infer relatively low SES thus relstively obese, would also explain difference efficacy.

Look, reasoning highly motivated - consider pandemic fully solved vaccine availability vaccinated whatever want moral obligation (I mean, got MRNA, right, bro?). need come harder study glossing easily nitpicked also easily covered details want change mind.

B) ""Come worship! mask required!""

Do let kids go trick treating? Swimming masks, snorkels, diving gear?


Do none masks get germs? I've seen plenty kids spit mask lens stop fogging up. share masks snorkels friends.


Then there's swimming general. exercise kids taught hold breath. love see go underwater longest swim deepest. logic lack oxygen poising carbon dioxide isnt good avoided costs.


Maybe parents move away state pools known beaches surrounded ocean. Maybe find desert little water. Reading news deaths rocketing USA, brings back horrors 2nd wave India April May year. People young 30 dying like fleas oxygen beds. mother barely escaped death dad ran around carrying oxygen cylinders looking hospital beds far 50kms away despite living Delhi. delta variant really strong high death rate immediate care provided. Americans ignoring vaccine prove dreadful them. mother one vaccinated 2nd wave India struggled much still brings tears eyes. miracle survived know least 10 people died 30s 40s, really healthy fit people dying within 10 days contracting it. It’s access healthcare, better neighborhoods, etc. 

We need make things even allocate resources communities need more. need defund rich communities route money poor communities make things equal. 

There’s thing good bad neighborhood allocate money places equally. Definitely non-insignificant part this. think general delusion part it. Although guess, HAES sort 'cognitive dissonance' self delusion.

Like said, even guilty this. much easier lie face truth. promote healthier lot hay made average age death 78, average life expectancy. Well, deaths increase 10% every age cohort, that's see. Duh. average newborn expect live 78 years. average person ducked early death lived 78, lives another 10 years. yeah. 10 years life average may lost. You’re missing part said there’s “added benefit”. argument, least California. enough vaccines go around. agree!  want know deer went crowded bar choir practice dammit Hey know that’s don’t even live Florida Gottlieb 2 weeks ago, ""We're one realizes."" Implying we'd platue cases now. course bunk. He's probably right schools linked infection, also: Duh?

He's political animal, blame HAES summarize: cheaper easier go get vaccine. Without legal risk.

Imagine mental effort denial requires. FFS people. WTF? people stop ruining astronomy good?!🤬 Yup. one easiest (and stupidest) ways get canned. biggest one travel reimbursements, frankly. anyone would throw away good salary great pension over, most, $500 beyond me. need instead masks. good point, pointing among group covid deniers non-hispanic white group seems loudest willing broadcast opinion. entirely likely group also vaccinated (esp hearing vaccination rate statistics political leaning). particular link data. Depends state well. states IDs much security handwritten note saying ""I me."" Fantastic timing. cases Canada doubling every two weeks now? Amazing pastors get serious business model jeapordized. seen data showing 1 person 102,000 cases lead death. recall specific vaccine was. think 500 breakthrough cases cases hospitalized. 

 Sorry link know details even 100 times still good odds. clearly MUCH safer vaccine. speak indigenous communities local me, but... hit hard first. many communities color. leaders started advocating measures mitigation long became national political football. 

Being governance semi full autonomous federal government probably helps. people Nation territories could care less Republican vs. Democrats. listen Nation leaders, pushing vaccination vaccine.   am, too. one kid that’s vaccinated another young get vaccinated. *The tithings! someone please think tithings!?* Reddit!   I'll also opening doors fall winter without gloves pulling sleeves hands. suggesting conspiracy *GPs* covering side effects??? That's even *less* likely. Even inclined hide side effects, ordinary family doctors. gain *nothing* covering side effects. true, current vaccine picture pretty well baked fall, think.

There's way reopening schools person current circumstances. Well, limited number shots. Every booster shot used elsewhere immunise someone else. one shot, go granny road two shots already, grandma India Brazil hasn't? 

Saying ""can't both"" practically used way country act selfishly whilst also avoiding admit making decision humans important humans there. get fake ID buy alcohol people today.

Really? Movies made believe fake IDs rite passage every teenaged American stupid shit heads every profession ""Yes face eating leopard, please eat face!"" Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* 19% highly vaccinated population, then. means 81% coming unvaccinated minority. framing headline irresponsible af, news media choosing keep pandemic news, continue scare already traumatized population keep lucrative clicks coming in. Genuinely trying rude, read time, VAERS received 6,490 reports death (0.0019%) among people received COVID-19 vaccine. FDA requires healthcare providers report death COVID-19 vaccination VAERS, even it’s unclear whether vaccine cause. Reports adverse events VAERS following vaccination, including deaths, necessarily mean vaccine caused health problem. 

So .0019% people got vaccine reported died receiving - vaccine, cause. even say vaccine killed .0019% people, number presumably far lower already tiny percentage. amazing even seem debate in-person schooling fall. 

It's going yet another huge fail hindsight, think. oldest got really sick getting shot. developed severe allergic reaction breathing issues J&amp;J vaccine ; dr. could explain. go emergency room twice shots help allergic reaction. scared I. since recovered, thankfully got shot , can’t remember one, adverse affect. enough put fear me. Plenty absolutely healthy people die though Wealth dominates ownership media. White people happen time consolidate sort influence. mean bad anything, people naturally tilt topic towards things relevant themselves. Thank that’s wanted know. I’m vaccinated March, major health issues honestly wondering gauge risk keep love safe. reason received lot (-) downvotes. wish would talk serious infections, well hospitalization death rates among vaccinated. seems far relevant. agree understandable targeted ethnicities apprehensive, try empathize them, also means hold accountable taking incorrect decision get vaccinated.

It *is* infantilizing us ""smart"" people justify bad decision making, especially much evidence exists favor vaccination. can't excuse wrongly also saying they're acting like mature adults. said said response someone saying “the majority sniffles”. 
So……  covid getting lethal… people vaccinated still spread it… wear masks?

You make sound like it’s insurmountable thing… 

My recommendation:
hotspots crowded hospitals wear masks, 
places cases hospitals good shape not.

It’s rocket science. almost impact economy. It’s everywhere time.

- nothing thing.
- strategic mask mandates
- active outbreak right overcrowded hospitals
- subsides reevaluate.

Covid burn end. might accelerate months end enough people gotten infected vaccinated often enough let burn out.
There maybe minor seasonal outbreaks, pandemic.

There respectable scientist thinks perpetual ever worsening variants covid way out. Sample size 400 vs 52,000. new study way small. Vaccines great shouldn’t cherry pick bad studies sell vaccines people probably don’t need them. Shocked hats ole miss. actually really nice people. still dont understand shouldnt punish medically unable get vaccinated immunity exists. virus doesnt care aboit reasoms get vsccinated. literally safety Paywall. sir push elevator buttons bare fingered. Hahaha yeah stepping outside Florida combination people ass, instant sweat, encountering tourists, encountering crazy anti-vaxers, etc. I've learned make really comfortable home, mostly already was, helps i'm home cook meals workout time.

And keep up! know hard weight loss linear. lost first 10 without even realizing, stopping eating initial lockdown, i'm working rest. Every day, step step. Legally speaking, least 2 week schedule. Even one week schedule though, clinics walk in. take maybe hour person's time takes day half recover. literally go local Walgreens shift day off, get vaccine, rest next day. That's takes. needs zero planning.

As still called in, that's valid certain point, boss refuses get vaccinated gonna bad time. Correct. Every time RNA replicated chance error lead mutation. pointing mutations become vs less prominent absolutely due natural selection. would, could, should...

When see **will, can, did**    doesnt change factor. Unfortunately already know average person US likely risk factors covid19. diet really healthy one. virulent spreads way faster, burning unvaccinated population extremely fast.    see photo story? young child oversized cloth mask. Nothing indicate saying. honestly think chance working?

Delta twice likely infect compared original virus. Read Welcome club, experienced member! post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:
  
[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yup didn’t say majority. said least 26%. Learn read. Sure mandates probably comply time:

If went public school vaccinated … simplest 1 1 example that’s literally different one likely included future students thing sticks around.

If joined military DEFINITELY got vaccinated probably worse stuff COVID one … another pretty obvious 1 1.

Less obvious mandates wear seatbelt mandate license drive mandate obey traffic laws mandates pay taxes mandate kill neighbor mandate passport leave country.

I’m going debate validity mandates should/shouldn’t … every day jump hoops little choice jump say nothing one particular thing much? like making decisions body imposing others forcing vacation not. LoL. let talk. People something contribute able support ideas without personal insults people know. Rona sickness concerned about. offended all, enjoy good discussion/debate :) Welcome sub! surprising. long history able trust authorities. Freedom choice = ban masks.

Florida. 😂

Hospitals overwhelmed sick kids. Delta originated India massive population low vaccination rates. gives virus far higher chance developing mutations smaller country say 50% population vaccinated.  assuming child's gender? “It mutated spread poor, innocent babies vaccine shedding people got jab! Also, definitely somehow Fauci’s fault!” understand you. Sorry edgy Redditors whose purpose life party. parents currently scared return schooling siblings vaccinated. Perhaps nurses wear purple  Yes, illegally. Bullshiters petiod [Scott Gottlieb said exact vaccine--no Pfizer's board former FDA commissioner, he's almost sure right this. hope he/she ok now. Anything like scary, especially age. Everytime kids sick, especially less 2, always scary. think many people realize many things impact children. I’d love get poll going see many people thread begging vaccine mandates also foam mouth mention PATRIOT Act. Remember, safety guys!   fundamental difference antivaxx moron opens mouth people die.  know, right? prerogative.  This.... make feel better. 😥

I get might comforted you; eventually, everyone touched death kick-started right thing.

For me, another bleak reminder many neighbors community members give fuck anyone themselves. certainly give fuck kids disabled medically compromised.

It's like I'm trapped abusive relationship. I'm everything I'm supposed I'm trying best never good enough get others care other.

I place high value willingness help care others without expecting anything return. thought universal human experience pandemic shattered illusion idea people fundamentally good caring.

Sucks, man. mean, racism implies specifically targeting racial groups. Nothing comment indicated that. cowbell! It’s dumb. makes sense.

Also guess somehow true, PEOPLE FLORIDA SPREADING IT. isn’t true, all, holy fuuuuuuuuuuu stupid people swayed logic.

It’s nonsense many levels.

I hope left us. “But wait, there’s more!” *Billy Mays voice* Hey dudes legit lol  People Covid, got vaccinated, caught covid - symptoms like second time?  disease circulating society, higher risk spreading someone can't get vaccinated themselves. People weak immune system, people cytotoxic etc.  seems like lot less effort fix excelsior.  too! Getting free American health care that’s available illegal immigrants. maximum benefit second dose starts wane 12 weeks. yea.. knows call this. 3rd dose called booster completion second attempt? 1st dose ""booster"" then? whatever.. Authoritarianism answer America. People resist harder push. Florida already % vaccinated states. Roughly 50%. Yep. Polio tragedy again.  want either, people gonna die personally hope ones selfish PoS problem endangering everyone else's life wanna feel special stick man ignoring elementary school science That's C-SPAN, man stellar ratings! want in-person schooling delayed, need go occupy classrooms make unusable. Chill, dude. another exposure spike protein going produce uber-variant something. immune system simply immediately eradicate primed it.  Oh 100%. also edited comment meant say didn’t wear mask lol  there’d something could done  I'm curious... feel forced to? 

It kind boggles mind NYC first wave. felt like chaos. Everyone basically knows least someone got severely sick. friends mom survived permanent lung damage, 2 friends ended icu. Now, delta variant like covid steroids. Yup, it’s sad  get sick COVID

Ftfy. Probably get every disease existence  Southern Louisiana? I'm sure that's rough rational person's psyche/morale surrounded idiocy. Stay safe sane.  acknowledge we're longer situation vaxxed return normal life, it'd impossible justify enacting new mitigation efforts. can't accused 'not trusting science' data. antivaxxers find another reason get it...sigh... exhausting. Ya sympathies circumstances. parent cancer they’re covid deniers hoping there’s miracle don’t catch covid closest I've seen. Recent news suggests logistics distribute vaccines place countries though. IANAL, work’s stance don’t NEED disclose, choose treated unvaccinated need follow guidelines set unvaccinated employees. guess schools option. FDA approval, I’m sure. realize heavy stuff top pools junk right? anything top heavy, cruise ship. one reason can't sail storm, roll would make turtle. normal ground swell issue designed around that.

Same house boats. Ever see house boat Amsterdam? literally build right edges barge. Again, righting moment keeps upright (used wrong term middle something trying reply you). rolls, displaces water side less water side. happens water pushes side lowest tends right ship house ballast, wide shallow narrow deep means ship quick roll hard overturn stiff. log shaped round bottomed means slow roll easy overturn tender.

House boats wide shallow, nature hard overturn. fan, trust me, hard tip. fact canoe easier tip. I've lived ocean whole life, state actually nicknamed Ocean State think house boats look top heavy, see America's Cup yachts, giant sails wind literally pushing over. Yet almost never capsize unless crew screws up. No, literally commented 200 lbs ideal weight according doctor.  percentage “definitely not” respondents far greater Republicans Blacks. people whose opinions hardened; everyone else get vaccinated eventually (when becomes inconvenient be). outdoors. Natural ventilation seems helpful. Masked outside. Unless know number indoor ones (esp air conditioning helps spread). really nice many ways courageous piece, saying needs said clearly accurately without clinging past dogma saying people want hear.

We handle factual 19% recent documented COVID-19 cases California breakthroughs,** state data shows fully vaccinated account increasing portion positive number, contradicts repeated public portrayal breakthrough cases negligible, easily misinterpreted. clear, indication sort vaccine failure. Quite cases expected. State data still suggests unvaccinated people nearly five times likely infected inoculated. almost hospitalizations deaths among unvaccinated people. Vaccines remain important tool fighting rising proportion breakthrough cases suggests **even people vaccinated potentially significant spreaders coronavirus, especially delta variant. reinforces vaccinated people also wear masks public settings.** vaccinated people well-protected serious illness, can, infected even they’re showing symptoms, spread virus others. Indeed, **people breakthrough infections delta variant might contagious unvaccinated people, although science continues evolving call vaccinated people masks protection. “It’s you, it’s everybody,” says Contra Costa County Health Officer Chris Farnitano. “It’s keeping cases down.”  Oh see. Yeah blanket statement, totally see you’re coming from. Cheers. Take non mrna vaccine version please! traditional vector vaccines there. options! Ohhh idea! It’s truly unbelievable. ask many occasions “wait, serious .. isn’t satire Onion.” 
It’s truly fascinating …. great sociological experiment . Lmao   Omg what?! takes serious mental gymnastics. One less fool radio fools listen to. fair, that's probably also true candidate Florida. reasoning end poor initial argument made mentions dependant anything, simply risk all, must stopped. telling argument moronic ridiculous strawman failed understand point pointing logical conclusion rather ironic. 

The literal point show used elsewhere argument falls apart either little nuance, great generalization. try use purposefully outlandish premise listed argument said, results ridiculous *point* made.

It's also frustrating clearly read comment past first sentence insist using bad faith arguments.

I surely can't reasonably expected continue discussion case.

Lastly, tagged someone repeatedly deletes comments arguments go way, maybe dont let words stand own. already deleted reposted comment once. fired people, people taking masks saying ""I'm talking"" ""I can't heard.""

Why opposed vaccines? Well Florida stopped reporting deaths age group, never truly know impact children Delta surge. Way give shit, huh? double dosed? might help. Nah he’ll end blaming Biden immigration this. know many people pouring Florida southern border. wouldn’t surprised see call wall around peninsula Buy? print one fill yourself, images blank ones place. It’s slightly difficult than…just getting damn shot. Gotta honest part loves Darwin effect covid has. Maybe we'll get Sturgis variant  fuck wrong people it?

Literally half adults state Florida Man?   local FB new pages, plenty conservatives pissed might let go jobs required get vaccinated work. none happy point republicans long made policy keep Texas ""right work"" state fired without explanation almost reason. Oh well, pull bootstraps start business guess. Natural selection glory.  always ones never expect  Hey, now. Dozens us ask this. *Dozens!*  people freedom liberty, cannot allow others absolute freedom. don’t get vaccinated you’re harming others, too. It’s certainly affecting freedom live people getting vaccinated, dragging pandemic.

Upvoted respect opinion &amp; like username. Hope mobile morgues ready rolled back couple weeks. Can’t Matthew. book written Jews. Pick another book written us all…. ;)~  vaccines freely available, see lockdowns ever happening again. reddit want here? 🙌🏼 definitely work customer service. Crazily, government force bodily autonomy rules even examples provided.

Driving? can't DUI/DWI, risk mitigation.

Guns? There's laws licensure, specific limitations, federal level, varying state level. risk mitigation.

Vaccine mandates limit impact highly infectious disease killed literally millions people worldwide? Risk mitigation.

It's like go around forcibly jabbing people, incentives like public school, job, etc. want responsible, contributing member society unfounded beliefs? Go ahead continue hold them, mad get privileges shitty people get.

You arguing vaccine mandates inherently political, especially based something arbitrary asinine bodily autonomy, used context. buy claiming seen multiple experts ignore consensus evidence, highly unlikely. wise watch mistakes around learn. certain zip codes populations low rates vaccination. Like less 40%, others 90%+. Cases primarily driven unvaccinated neighborhoods. Try living Saskatchewan..... covid restrictions I'm afraid kid goes back school (under 12).  I've seen ones seeing smiles hurts ability learn socialize. Sigh. Disney film crew nonetheless  Places like Florida seeing surge hospitalization, affect patients, clearly public safety. idea talking about. lose access guns, never drive, always wear masks take point logical extreme.

 argument moronic saying, ""everyone access nukes take pro-2nd amendment claims logical extreme."" idea dismissed poor logic using. I'm saying previous infection vaccine greater breakthrough vaxxed vaxxxed/infected. Delta enough spike difference body recognized seen something similar body producing strong response. Except aren't. mean, yes, 99% folks bottom scam are, Republican members House, Fox News personalities, vaccinated, earliest opportunity.

The worst place hell reserved duped, orchestrated misinformation campaign got people killed, could make money. honestly hate this. check local papers Facebook page see news people think talking points fox news insane. 

Now realize networks put spin it, course. One best college courses took read media(really phenomenal course taught news producer). taught us cut opinions find facts. 

I know media sides push agenda.  agenda facts. Find facts. Look objectively.  Create opinion.  

The USA desperately need strictly news source. opinion facts. 

The problem generate hate division would ratings would fail person like would watch day.  tax ones forcing us stay inside every country done far worked. 

What countries talking about? New Zealand Taiwan?

New Zealand failed prevent Delta reaching also struggling Delta despite President variant one infectious virus strains ever discovered. Mask wearing lockdown cannot reduce R0 less one. simply never complete lockdown

Good wife, agreed it, nice legacy him. wish gotten shot, seems like nice person. asking God God save him. 🙄 Well, there's reason that... main argument could see mainline Christianity, apply mRNA vaccines, vaccines developed using fetal cells aborted baby aborted several decades ago. Personally think ethical arguments even vaccines (won’t go here).

BUT mRNA vaccines don’t ethical issues! don’t come fetal cells it’s completely different technology. So, anything, Christians reason accept vaccines! DeSantis stupid - he’s vaccinated knows virus predominantly killing base. also knows Democrats overwhelmingly vaccinated. can’t 180 say ‘hey lied, need social distance wear masks get vaccinated’ base he’s spent year saying useless ‘freedom’ something. solution lean virus, get spread much possible, hope kills Democrats Republicans. find people internet hold every position. doesn’t make less strawman though discussing kind policies might actually happen. I’ll take word it. get vaccines, don’t scrutinize required not. 

Thanks enlightenment:)  Lol Lmao idiotic take  freedom get sick also prevent using finite health care resources. clogging system prevent people getting surgery getting treatment heart attacks etc. lead totalitarian shit already is. body choice - deal consequences choice. asking sources users post answer.

Watch another 30% trip get shot. Probably take three kinds. Full dosage science says they’re rock solid safe. Allegedly. fun):   Coronaviruses proofreading functionality influenza not. mutate less often influenza, don’t track mutation seasonal
Influenza.  virus mutates moment vaccines updated new variants, scientists course stupid so. Coronavirus mutates (significantly) slowly, maybe still time become unstoppable present day vaccines.  Remember, even Delta persistent reports reinfection. time generally dismissed false positives think know better now.  recalled Florida. Grab TP! gonna get bumpy!!!

I'm trying keep 10 month old safe poin. probably first birthday party rate.  Kids arent making choices get vaccinated. That's bit like saying ""both Democrats communists want larger role government"".

There us say ""Covid risk kids smaller lot preventable risks typically worry huge amount about, sure we're overprotective Covid salient?"" we're constantly downvoted called child murderers, sadly Covid policy polarised moralised way risks health largely aren't. debatable bodily autonomy directly negatively impact around you, point legitimately killing them.

There many ways already happens. Driving cars, Owning guns, potential harm people.

When start harming people, get limited. do, please less. case, business, place residence, etc etc, prevent people havent taken reasonable precaution around you.

That means ensuring people properly masking tested, vaccinated.

There place government tell people must bodies. mandates used US great affect, there's reason 

Just something done mean again. also listed cogent reason related politicized nonsense talking anti-vaxx apparently hip trendy thing doing.

People weary new actually. think recency bias makes feel way, far tell, reactions fairly common ways react pandemics least historical precedence it.

Also, vast majority people aren't. Heck, country literally overwhelming majority people are. 80% 12+ almost 70% double.

In country even, 60% one dose double isnt far under. look chart, actually still increasing, idea super trendy people stupid largely overblown.

Could better? Probably, nowhere near portraying be.  really think work punching bunch keys computer? I’m going take medical advice Australian.   /s



Thank link part Oregon there's mobs citizens (not even parents school aged kids) meeting protest petition kids wear masks school. So, seems safe. county one leading counties new cases swear I've seen 1-2 deaths county alone every day week. we're talking 4-6 deaths daily statewide see impressive is. Woo. Go us. boat here. going go Europe next week based optimism since cases, hospitalizations, deaths significantly June. 6 weeks later delta variant rampant I’m going. I’m concerned catching thought testing positive board flight left stranded foreign country terrifying.  raw number relevant given none population vaccinated last year. direct comparisons misleading, best. US winning another gold medal probation mandatory. read 72% population received least one dose

The rates *fully vaccinated* need 70% higher get anywhere near herd immunity. Getting praise rates partial vaccination like getting participation trophy point. like putting public risk people
Getting unvaccinated filling hospital rooms, leave hospital staff distress possibility stronger mutation ? good leader admit they're wrong bad leader doubles down. Guy deserve position authority.  hope you’re things mental health family going suffer. guess parents life less concerned all. one expressed level concern people Reddit seem to.  Gibraltar 100% vaccination rate reporting average 23 new cases day... view seems scientific.  mean phrased like would agree certain extent. believe people able make whatever choices want unless choices hurt people - 20k+ people getting sick every day close 90 people dying day state kind cold hearted moron wouldn’t able see something needs change 🤣🤣🤣 Oxygen supplies big help Covid, odds surviving ventilation poor (to extent clinicians say “everyone [on ventilator Covid] dying,” it’s slight hyperbole).

Outside vaccines steroids, there’s lot modern medicine offer people, especially develop severe Covid.

To extent we’ve kept potential death toll, we’ve done primarily though public health measures, medical ones. condition accepting probation. I’m exchange leaving sentence early. one forced ask probation.

Besides, already allowed drink, smoke, drugs probation. one complained that? nothing giving government kind power. literally middle plague morons take care themselves, give shit anyone else themselves. problem this. idiots keep blowing bigger problem even exist. Yeah, tell people
Who broke living street it. isn’t exactly easy Yeah, remember least year entitled parents ranting teachers willing die order students typical school year?  


The obvious insanity sentiment aside, know what's \*really\* disruptive child's learning? teacher dying halfway year realizing may inadvertent cause it. literally advocating death people refuse get vaccine, understand insane sound? shortages pandemic. It’s going get worse. entering field pandemic hit? like getting hit sideways. Zombification.  Like, anti vax cousin says vaccinated spreading Covid unvaccinated. can't stupid anymore. used want mask mandates IDC anymore, unless schools. Mask kids up!!  Glad see it. I'm saying I'm cool it. what's going happen. actually pretty fucking awful. well.. also Colombia variant too..
 
B.1621 something.. Somehow every downlow anti-vaxxer sub knows *multiple* people *severe* breakthrough cases. pretty sketch. 

My anecdotal experience I'm aware single person breakthrough covid infection. id Florida Buffalo Wild Wings gift card. lack sympathy sympathy like forum likes say “surging” unvaccinated Abbot kind POS who

...can't stand Texans? Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon   struggle literally every profession. Accounts, UX designers, mechanics - everyone struggles explain things “non-experts” given field. It’s unforgivable government agency huge, bloated budget funded tax dollars couldn’t manage this.  raising child bubble prior COVID? 

There prior COVID him. exist. one mile rural area Thursdays. very, empty. took daughter get one else times. next closest location get vaccine 40 minutes away either direction. lot people *assume* that's without ever actually tested straight lie fit whatever narrative want. 

You know people gonna lie breakthrough cases get family visits work shit. know it. additional risk TOP flu hit, zero benefit him. put additional risk go concert? makes sense. agree. feel bad Stafford guy lot potential Lions capitalize on. remember watching get sacked like dozen times 2018 Vikings taken aback like, Detroit thinking?! share pain. least face day knowing aren’t cheese heads. There's issue English. German separate words :

Infection: process viral particle entering cell. 

And

Infection: process develops presence number germs body.

Vaccines stop 100% former, greatly reduce it. highly effective preventing latter. mandate Pfizer vaccine 12+ right honestly. would save lives chickenpox vaccine already mandate schools.

The FDA EUA process *dramatically* rigorous proving safety efficiency existed 1922 Supreme Court unanimously ruled vaccines could mandated schools. vaccines time crudely manufactured would never get licensed today. “Fucked up” “currently fucking hourly basis” may change minds always CNAs LVNs anecdotal experience. RNs know problem vaccine. Choices consequences. 

That aspect many people seem forgetting.     reason shutdowns would ensure hospitals function. hospitals full killing innocent people emergencies covid.

I could care little unvaxxed people point stupidity clogging hospitals preventing people care others getting preventive care, urgent care etc. biggest experiment history Theyre killing I'm generally cool youngest can't vaxxed yet worrisome. kids given lives shit people can't even wear mask vaccinate. oldest line straight away still wear masks... Even outdoors. Yep. 90-95% protected infection all, including asymptomatic forced accept probation either. choose serve full sentence. man forced leave jail early. Covid won’t added. Covid vaccine tourism thing promoted countries fucking counter point time “bIdEn nEeDs FiX BoArdEr CrISis” it’s got painfully stupid thing I’ve ever heard. state ACTUAL crisis dense lunatic  depends mean ""end"" pandemic. make SARS-COV2 disappear way SARS1 did? No, nothing that: ship probably sailed time 2020 began, let alone February. make ""endemic"", ie ""it's still there, big national problem more"", like measles others: yes, people still catch occasionally, even die - fill hospitals. Authoritarianism go brrr  Imagine getting infected due large viral load without vaccinated 😑 government U.S. would fucking anarchy Martial Law. Settle spook shit. would fly, political affiliation irrelevant.  feel wife!  Dude, whole department striked Summer 2020, Cali getting hit. person department crossed picket line. thought cause legit, couldn’t strike middle largest Heath crisis century. co-workers going local paper saying hospital withholding PPE. Meanwhile pallets different brands N95 masks central. One woman previously declared years negotiating contract striking Christian values. one lying PPE local media. spectacle. Dems Republicans front hospital pandemic dancing “get sickness” disturbed. One big happy family. misleading, leading. agree you. Hell, even vaccines available statistically unlikely seriously affected covid. Everything avoid catching spreading virus really help others. never fear myself. I'm double-vaxxed also pretty high risk tolerance. Even worse one: 210 100k 0.21%. Get vaccinated, folks. Breakthrough cases regardless vaccine got, extremely rare. zero sympathy left.

They’ve months. it’s fault chose buy anti-vaxx bullshit. High school football season starts next week neck woods. game August 26 AT&amp;T Stadium Cowboys play. That’s gonna hell superspreader event, get fact Dallas Cowboys kick season less month later. 

I don’t think there’s way get far lockdown, there’s anything state protect, it’s football. many kids, alternative nothing. reliable internet, insecure home, etc. School many safe zone.  I'm mad you, I'm trying figure talking about.

So police show arrest armed trespasser? asked leave don't, trespasser law they're asked enforce.  Australia Taiwan. It’s becoming clear zero COVID cases temporary. always flare-ups. wool thick 'round here. There’s strict lockdowns USA long time shouldn’t excuse see friends Long story short. 

The vaccine makes far less likely get sick. Vaccines never perfect. everyone vaccinated likelihood spreading far far less. 

Also ENTIRE problem virus it’s infection rate. Every person gets sick infects 3 more. it’s growth exponential quickly overwhelms hospital system ans happens death rate spikes. everyone resources taken away deal Covid. 

The vaccine helps 2 ways. 

- fewer people get sick infection rate brought level exponential growth. Eg like flu. 

- get sick don’t fill hospitals cases less severe. 

Long story short. Even vaccine perfect ends achieving goals need. Reducing Covid concern level flu. 

But that’s enough people get vaccinated that. want physically go Microsoft office.  Jesus! Anti-vaxer protected class like age, race, sexuality, ethnicity, etc. They'll get condition employment. again, they're worried getting infected Covid, they're probably worried hunger homelessness, either.

Imagine subjecting oneself every hardship imaginable take ownership one's political opponents. way live. Good luck exemptions. company said medical religious exemptions kooks already putting signage front doors lmao think wearing seatbelt affect others? ever thought happens event accident, past point someone dying? would mean road closed somebody cleans *mess* investigation complete, time money. people scene deal seeing - civilians emergency service workers, mental image stuck them. 

Even somebody die, injuries wearing seatbelt likely add time complications dealing accident scene.

On top might invalidate insurance, expert certain, would effectively driving uninsured. accident insurers use anything get paying. Would also likely get much personal injury claim suffered injury someone else blame, time also partly blame accident injury way, called ""contributory negligence"" ""Twice likely reinfected"" means efficacy natural infection second infection (100-2n)%, efficacy natural infection plus vaccination (100-n)%. n represents relative likelihood someone vaccinated infected getting infected again, would double part equation looking infection only.

The article states exact multiple 2.34 efficacy would fact (100-2.34n)% means infection actually slightly likely double. 

So example recent J&amp;J results showing 71% effective Delta infection, would mean infection alone least 32% effective. practice underestimate, potentially huge one, J&amp;J less effective vaccine compared Moderna Pfizer combination vaccine infection lead higher efficacies vaccine alone. say vaccine plus natural infection 80% effective would imply natural infection alone 53% effective. vaccine plus infection 90% effective infection would 77% effective on. Thats conclussion make. conclude vaccines effective. maybe go get vaccinated…  free pay taxes least France
It's even effective delta variant (cf Israël) admitted help transmitting all.

It's never gonna help us get pandemic. good hygiene, risky population vaccinated, respecting sanitary measures (social distanciation so) funding research find treatments gonna help us get it.

And treating population bunch dumbasses way go all. Neither taking away rights. without pass can't go hospital. Doctors pissed directive since everyone rhe right get treated. want prevent people voting vaccinated. (they refused bill asking exemption sanitary pass voting) heck lol

Thos governement lying since beginning one trust them. Sad that's is. Weird flex okay Guess? Will. going eat burgers run treadmill I’d equal “right people peacefully assemble”? Again, calculated application pedantry avoid addressing actual issue.

Let's put plainly see engage basic level: 

Why, opinion, mask mandates effective? mean, offense anecdote clearly lining actual data

that's thing anecdotal experience, wildly unrepresentative

guessing posts (and username lol) pilot yourself, definitely get weird contrarian alt-right ones experience they're actually far less common

flight attendants 80% would expect. lot empty headed buffoons group unfortunately. kind like get anti-vax doctors they're way less common anti-vax nurses, etc already that.

We use masks, socially distance, got vaccinated. extent something “constructive”.  Wonder he’d ok doctors wearing masks God forbid children needed surgery ? would ok Docs nursing staff breathing ?

GET READY NEW VARIANT BOYZ     Mine come stickers, want stickers! yeh im fully vaxxed got covid july.

the cpls days sick werent bad ive still got 2 symptoms put long covid category....and sucks.  upset people get vaccinated trying remain empathetic fact people died misinformed, tragedy. 

I personally like removal personal agency. vaccines created spring 2020, essentially year half ago. Absolutely everybody planet ample time inform themselves, desired level.  Fluoride doesn’t calcify teeth. also calcifies soft tissues body decreases functionality. notably, calcifies [pineal responsible sleep wake cycle, psychological development, ability make decisions, perceive reality. calcification soft tissues includes heart valves make prone problems. linked tap water fluoride toothpaste. science clear. 

What debate right whether Fluoride [developmental newest studies show clearly is. Studies even shown fluoride water doesn’t even help [tooth adults barely children. Fluoride tooth paste help though. 

That article even points flaws early studies fluoride still used basis safe claim today. Yeah people want benefit participating society want contribute way form. Probably also people whine paying taxes. fully expect happen, though Northeast fewer deaths per cases vaccinated higher.

I know babbling about. point was, know asshole would get satisfaction Florida higher vaccine uptake, even hate governor.

Similarly though, know anyone would take satisfaction saying, hey look people area dying too! Look, died!

I laughed. Well played. vaccine stop even deter transmission, would took fact we’d likely deal problems come imperfect vaccination, increased transmission studied we’re supposed immunized safe, still transmitting deadly mutating virus, we’ll end fertility issues kids die they’ll old enough handle vaccine.

Every study needs healthy control group, whether agree mindset participants within relevant science we’re supposed learning Might've better attack unmasked people crowded indoor places like WalMart Winco Grocery Outlet, unmasked adults multiple kids coughing everything. Thank you. said year ago downvoted oblivion. People need get real pandemic US. almost social end it, getting people double mask point anything like that. Let’s stick one mask, lucky get people wear point.  stage pandemic ..covid endemic going away. .they testing hoards deer wild animals seeing ..take precautions sooner later enough people get sick get antibodies plus vax rates go  way might emphasize status temporary inconvenience, permanent norm. 

I actually think opposite. way got current mess overselling vaccines intensively trumpeting idea would kind light end tunnel really soon. 

This like George Bush invading Afghanistan saying minor war would really quick. leads loss credibility trust, perception people charge know they're deliberately lying, provides fuel (perhaps rightly) conspiracy theorists anti-vaxxers.

IMO CDC frank, saying ""we going fighting virus time, probably years. one promising quick victory here. need time make sure many people possible alive healthy best chance lead normal life. American people need steadfast, inventive, courageous, help other, seen many times past."" explain well. point parent's liberty extend refusing medical treatment child result would death. state step in.

This similar. right choose death others. virus doubled transmissibility, public health considerations changed. consider else might kill poor decision. would require law passed make happen. law ever passed require knowledge, unless include attempts abortion laws. Mandatory diets. would interesting see many new infections correlated political affiliation. Long story short: right get jabbed, also responsibility spread disease. Therefore, jab, play. Well what's religion? Christianity dont follow main tenets way kinda calling BS. ""I wonder wait till plague locusts waters run red right thing.""

There people NNN saying even ""bodies dropping dead streets"" go back masks social distancing. 

So no. .I think ""Biblical plagues"" going change anything. I'm aware why. original comment replied implied going go business this. seems basically monopoly corner nowhere, saying seems unlikely.  worry, loud pipes save lives. Pretty soon COVID kicked campus hazing Pretty sure damage claiming happen;

Is vaccine production even bottleneck anymore? Seems like there's bigger challenges putting liquid bottle, putting liquid shoulder. That’s fair point - it’s definitely possible pro vax anti-pass, I’m willing bet it’s minority within minority :p got sick week: got Johnson &amp; Johnson April. People think validates vaccines useless. I’ve mild cold probably felt better 80% prior flus. said, I’m pretty sure would much worse place hadn’t gotten vaccine.

Good explanation here, current CDC Literally one cares.  [Yes, course cases fell mean Sturgis impact cases. Cases falling could due number factors.

And reported cases. number cases identified sizable—140 cases per 100 000 attendees—it likely true national impact Sturgis event underestimated attendees asymptomatic mild illness may tested SARS-CoV-2, attendees may reported attending Sturgis rally, variability health department resources identify interview COVID-19 cases, identify sources infection, conduct contact tracing detailed outbreak investigations. Nobody cares. Michael J Fox?  workers. 

If get car, surely would agree work job? what's problem?  understand mean, see **decision** affects health outcomes negatively. Whether decision ""yes"" ""no,"" impact health.

Still isolated world poor country, proved government subordinates state apparatus vaccination, plans process wisely communicates responsibly inhabitants even mountainous terrain, inhabitants vaccinated.

&amp;#x200B;

 
In late March / early April, Bhutan, small Himalayan kingdom sandwiched India China, jumped top world immunization rankings. Within week, country vaccinated 90 percent. adult residents, i.e. 60 percent. entire population. late July, needed days distribute second dose vaccine .

 
Let's learn Bhutan 
Will Parks, UNICEF representative Bhutan, said local vaccination campaign arguably fastest-ever campaign kind world. still isolated poor country proved government subordinates state apparatus vaccination, plans process wisely communicates responsibly people, even mountainous terrain underdeveloped infrastructure, injection given residents. scale quite different, many countries could follow example. 


&amp;#x200B;

 
  
""If learn something now, country like Bhutan, doctors nurses, determined king government leadership mobilizing society, vaccinate entire population,"" said AFP Parks. 


&amp;#x200B;

 
A country another world 
Bhutan's unique strategy fits country that, many ways, seeks exist outside rest world. 1970s, latter monarchy South Asia (which never colonized) practically closed foreigners. Although possible enter without major problems, government tries limit number guests much prevent degradation unspoiled nature protect unique culture. Every tourist, addition buying visa, must contract local guide minimum fee $ 250. per day (200 season). Bhutan finances environmental protection, also free health care income tourism. 


&amp;#x200B;

 
The country also remains geographically isolated. international airport Paro land planes two local carriers: Druk Air Bhutan Airlines due one difficult landing approaches world Himalayan peaks. airlines fly mainly India countries region, small offer automatically limits contact world. 


&amp;#x200B;

 
Bhutan also unique terms system. Since 2008, constitution enshrined development goal maximizing Gross Happiness Index, GDP. takes account variables state environment level health, although contrary popular opinion, Bhutan still measures GDP according World Bank comparable Kosovo, Indonesia Tunisia respect. 


&amp;#x200B;

 
All strength vaccination 
In addition, Bhutan simply small - approx. 750 thousand. residents, including approx. 530 thousand. adults get coronavirus vaccines. size everything, success would possible without wise policy authorities. 


&amp;#x200B;

 
Already spring, first vaccination round, authorities decided instead lengthy trial, preferred wait launch campaign days. Neighboring India, Bhutan close ties, gifted kingdom 550,000. doses locally produced AstraZeneki. However, Bhutan waited entire shipment reach country. time, authorities organized vaccination logistics residents, including helicopter supply chain mountain villages overland transportation would time-consuming. Nearly 22 thousand people volunteered help, incl. informing operation preparations fighting erroneous news. help deliver preparation Bhutan, UNICEF country's authorities sent one 20 pilots authorized land Paro, Calcutta, 


&amp;#x200B;

 
After success lightning fast campaign, however, problems began. India, struggling soaring coronavirus cases , halted exports vaccines. first time Bhutan learned gross national happiness cannot replace hard cash, simply cannot afford obtain preparation quickly open market. true authorities bought 200 thousand. doses Pfizer, deliveries expected fall. interval doses would threaten herd immunity. Ultimately Bhutan managed obtain 500,000. Moderna doses part donation Covax allianceand another 250 thousand. AstraZeneki gift Denmark. countries provided total another 700,000. doses different vaccines, Bhutan may enough preparations equally rapid second round, even good supply, including planned autumn vaccinations teenagers . 


&amp;#x200B;

 
The king last

 
Logistics thoughtful strategy helped Bhutan, authorities went persuade residents accept vaccine. spring first round, King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, held high esteem, said would take injection last. countries responsible politicians tried first convince inhabitants safety preparations, Bhutan monarch's declaration meant one wanted delay vaccination thus potentially put king danger. king also traveled around country immunization rounds, accompanying citizens registration injection added incentive.

&amp;#x200B;

 
However, real authors success Prime Minister Lotay Tshering, Foreign Minister Tandi Dorji Health Minister Dechen Wangmo. three understood challenges posed pandemic perfectly well - Tshering surgeon Dorji Wangmo public health specialists. Especially Wangmo, degree Yale University, coped challenge perfectly. rulers probably realized Bhutan's health care - although free put pedestal important component level national happiness - would able cope uncontrolled pandemic. country less three doctors 10,000. inhabitants, less Sudan Afghanistan. addition, infrastructure primarily cities, mountain villages difficult access. 


&amp;#x200B;

 
Vaccinations success democracy

&amp;#x200B;

 
For Bhutans, vaccination success - country ranks third world fully vaccinated populations, behind UAE Israel - could also democratic success. current government second one since abolition absolute monarchy 2008, competence leaders certainly strengthen popularity. world, despite specificity Bhutan, may prove vaccination carried anywhere. rich countries, delivering several hundred thousand doses big challenge, countries Global South help UN organization effectively quickly vaccinate inhabitants. happen, however, governments must recognize importance prioritizing vaccines strong political support. also clarified federal government cannot, state governments can.    exactly true. Aye, time, given certain level intelligence, one figure bs rest. sad is, even really nice people unintelligent. need better education, would fix that, problems well.

For students need person , hybrid option.

Well I'm sure vaccination lot keep getting virus, even though work well partner. Good luck you, swift recovery partner! want bet oxygen supplies come from? India, suspect. find supplier. something like 99% infections result indoor transmission.

IIRC, closer 99.9%. Irish contact tracing say around 1/1000 cases outdoor transmission. think Singapore suggested common, weird categorization ""construction"" considered outdoors, even though significant part ""construction"" involved people indoors plumbing, electrical, etc.

The huge difference indoor outdoor transmission also one things suggests aerosol transmission. droplets, indoor/outdoor matter much droplets carried much air currents, whereas aerosols easily dispersed air currents.

Anyway, Delta might change calculus little (more particles, somewhat infectious), probably huge amount, certainly event like (NYC: higher vaccination, good mask usage). AFAICS number also includes doses donated. rEseArCh We’re fully vaccinated live one bedroom flat there’s going anywhere us key competitors take similar stance - looking increasingly likely. 

It’ll interesting, think many folks rude awakening. Path A: Get vaccine, let's say 2 shots - maybe fall minuscule percentage significant reaction. path like, go crosswalk, wait walk light, cross street. twice - that's it. Yes, sometimes people get hurt even killed, crossing street even light...

Path **F**: Get covid, maybe fall percentage significant reaction. path like, ~~go get car accident,~~ go busy street, cross light hope cars stop... maybe walk away, maybe life long injuries, maybe die. High likelihood need physical therapy... Yeah, I'll wait go cross **with** light...twice... lot people get seriously sick need hospitalized. Hospitals fill up, there’s way take care them, people ailments don’t receive care…

Have seen what’s happening Florida? happened last year Italy New York?

How protect vulnerable population? people would die got Covid unable get vaccine?

Your comment well-written heartless turns blind eye suffering people experiencing. anyone aware data Sinovac v Delta? Everything pre-Delta solid I'm still trying find information holds now. Waste water seems like likeliest bet well Lots things life kill hurt you.
Should ban automobiles well? Outright ban cigarettes etc record, ones claiming line Pope, stated it’s moral requirement. Man, I'm really starting despise lot people subreddit. endless procession stupidity every single day. favor anecdotes headlines actual data. think need another break.  also want know 15 years number comes from. make much sense. Children freedom go school.

And adults freedom regulate workplaces unsafe practices. read article, statement many kept hospital longer order complete treatment, despite better. it’s technically true. studies could skewed fact didn’t take account ill patients receiving treatment control group.  god forbid ever put restrictions access services incentives. Sure glad never put restrictions access health care unemployment funds. That'd nightmare. Ufc 265 sold single person appeared wearing mask. vaccines can’t boxed mailroom taken local UPS store. strict protocols place manufacturers repack - there’s cost associated that. agree would wonderful dose vaccine that’s expire could shipped country need, wish food waste metric ton could shipped county need (or better yet given country need it), won’t happen. Asking someone get available dose hopes somehow make developing country idealistic.  drug cocktails? curious COVID rates live. country in? legitimate reports I’ve seen third dosing US revolves around ‘at risk’ people. 

That said I’ve monitoring nursing subs becoming alarmed number breakthroughs delta seeing nurses vaccinated December curious way made need boosters since highly exposed. 

I think need research. need stand commitments getting shots sent countries may address boosters Americans well. can’t health care workers risk example. Novavax? big problem trying different requirements vaccinated unvaccinated people. easy way tell whether someone vaccinated not, places impossible burden people trying enforce rules society. workable approach rules everybody.

It's driving car. different speed limits traffic laws people depending driving abilities. Everyone observe speed limits laws even though skilled drivers over-conservative.

You imagine scenario people ""good drivers"" want ""rewarded"" able go hundred freeway observe stop signs, would probably scientific justification okay. obvious reasons.  achieve freedom forced things? well-documented medical exemption would acceptable place proof vaccination. likely going lose good portion team members competitors punish leaving city. truly believe way work never going go back pre-covid normal that's necessarily bad thing. Looks like pandemic begun. 2020 pre-pandemic 🥲 adults 2 weeks past full vaccination everyone presents negative COVID test. Man homeschool year 

You’re teacher. You’ll great I'm even sure profit major motivator upping frequency. Tetanus *terrible* way die, vaccine cheap, effective, virtually zero side effects. probably good idea. Studies showing mixing matching different types vaccines gives better immunity. I'm really happy got AstraZeneca first Moderna second (even knocked ass two days). Path A: Get vaccine, let's say 2 shots - maybe fall minuscule percentage significant reaction. path like, go crosswalk, wait walk light, cross street. twice - that's it.
Yes, sometimes people get hurt even killed, crossing street even light...

Path **F**: Get covid, maybe fall percentage significant reaction. path like, go get car accident, maybe walk away, maybe life long injuries, maybe die. High likelihood need physical therapy...  Yeah, I'll go cross street twice... ""measures difference average age death individuals died within given time frame average age people would expected reach""

It's similar, think much worse. quote ""measures difference average age death individuals died within given time frame average age people would expected reach"" link suggests includes everyone dying period, include excess deaths (so diagnosed COVID; study casts wider net). imply ""that nothing done eventually everyone could expect die decade early"", since large fraction study period would very-hard-hit New Jersey nursing homes. Man, *wish* case.

But think long less intelligent people drag feet getting vaccine, variants continue ravage society, remain realistic expectations.

That mean scream doom every corner, hunker like 2020. also mean pandemic finished global level, not, definitely another couple years.  projections I've seen Finland 70% fully vaccinated November. Far slower would like, can't really anything myself, so, masking staying away people still. There's still ""new normal"", that's part it. Remote work commonplace, flexibility work, fast food retail jobs offering bonuses paid college tuition attract workers, fucked supply chain including shipping containers quintupling price, widespread mental health issues result pandemic, probably list like 30 things least, different before, probably going away anytime soon.

But yeah, people thinking everyone going keep self-isolating homes time getting vaccinated never socializing way base. obviously never going happen. 

Hell, could see New Zealanders acted Covid eliminated way back like May 2020. Packed stadiums right away. lot people get confused this. (the CDC) never said delta serious illness smallpox, said equally transmissible. US, least state (MA) schooling compulsory aged 6-16. youngest two 11. don’t send year safety, day five truant officer comes still don’t send them, I’ve got Child Protection life didn’t send them.
I could homeschool. 6 years oldest.
But that’s huge don’t want them, oldest needed it.

Bottom line schools get $ kid don’t go don’t get $.
So make sure go.

Where take kids year? wish choice year only. Nooooo wanted see Spiritbox badly. band fucking good Maybe I’m wrong, thought still reviewing data? found adorable animal print face masks old navy kid could bear, cat, raccoon. I’ve got solid color masks. idea could scary. dentist appt dentist face mask full face shield, could see scary also medical setting kids understood dentist protected open mouths. first dose antibodies detected antibody test? first jab pfizer 1 month ago, remember nurse said bleeding extra much, thought lot adrenaline body (I nervous, well biked there). get sore arm hours later lasted day, like people know got, think much it. 

But still makes bit worried, makes think maybe missed. antibodies created first dose detected typical antibody test? Rickyism wife took it. issues. 

Anecdotal: wife spent day car daughter riding around getting senior pictures day daughter tested positive covid. far wife fine. Personal choice sounds great find populace toddlers. looked form, simple yes I've vaccinated.

 would know someone lied since shots database. paper card..  back pain 2 days, right side shoulders, lower back. seems typical reaction. Yes, death hospitals past year equivalent entire career. I've never heard hospitals using freezer trucks storage 2020. folks thing. hate visiting thr news cycle always fuckin on. make claim whether variants formed vaccinated unvaccinated populations study, simply observation resistant variants *may* exist. Cost living pretty much directly correlates “nice” majority people lol really want wear masks much next year. school locality requires it, must. people stupid?

Oh wait, voted guy... Well roughly half state already least one shot (a little misleading course bc population eligible) going hesitant people. Gonna slower rollout. Really? think thing gets worse, kills lot people community, wrecks health system basic services get interrupted, tanks economy it’s ‘over’?

Things lot complex that.  think antibody treatment would much long term benefit. passive part immune system die(degrade?) time. Thy inky get replaced B-cells.

It's like transfusion. OK mutation happening randomly factors working it? already see behavior viruses. yeah idk wtf really going rely people smarter me. Problem know can't agree wtf going fix this. keep slapping band-aids problem hoping something work. Awesome, thanks explanation! Ooor - hear out! - let's *not* that! new variants. about... everyone get vaccinated stop breeding stuff!

No? wanna, let's carry like this, because? Aww...  It’s masks. governor ordered local government could impose stronger covid restrictions state has. Currently state none way reduced capacity venues voluntarily doing. it’s struggle hit hard last year. city great covid Abbott started messing things last summer. 

So Austin populace good masking vaccinations there’s lot college kids didn’t get vaxxed also tourists. Even Austin residents perfect covid precautions, doesn’t change surrounding counties care covid fill Austin’s hospitals. say less likely vaccinated.

They absolutely do. Look figure 3 Note evangelicals; Jesus's love works distance also. happen idiots. I'm sorry developed MS it. worried I'd already neuro symptoms infection (tingling face), though MRI clear subsided recovered. definitely surprised long COVID similar process -- know many viral different infections potential, viruses seem cause often others do. FYI posted title article without editorializing (which generally practice linking news sources). I’ve found sub pretty darn good parsing highlighting relevant info. ""It is""

\-D. J. Trump smart health care providers swab fully vacc'ed people cards differently non-vacc'ed. That's good way looking it. even though still think low number, still 5x greater average daily amount people testing positive COVID daily basis. think heard recently elected officials count ""workers"" purposes humanist congregation virtual year half. know what? fucking sucks. know hearts we're right thing protecting one another community. would like think Jesus would agree. Poor people less educated, black people poor, uneducated people hessitant get vaccine, easy that. Apparently works. would sort hard tip double moored. meant travel open seas lake river, stability issue since ground roll. 

For ship anything floating roll over, center gravity go strakes. that's going apply house boat ship build, regardless material. things probably stable ship size displacement there's likely free surface effect (water inside hull). fill foam, would impossible water get inside. mean container ships maximum roll 22-30 degrees, that's pretty far think far stack containers water line. Free surface usually ships sink destabilize roll moment. something tips water, side greater buoyancy displacing water. free surface effect, weight shifts side negating greater buoyancy. fact make ship roll greater would otherwise given sea.

I mean seen cruise ships today? There's heck lot waterline: boat support weight water that. fact, ships can't support weight without water. drydocks specially built sorts support ship keel break. crazy know, works physics. that, African Americans generally receive neglect mis-diagnoses compared Caucasians. Due wealth disparity, also tend work jobs require lot human contact (i.e. retail / service), live poorer district less medical Welcome allowed come work risk infecting colleagues clients/customers. Lots folks find rapidly unemployed. Yes. get free antibody test donating blood.  Basically means trying control factors. 

For example, vaccinated people likely live spend time vaccinated people - would increase apparent efficacy controlled. 

Something would reduce apparent efficacy would vaccinated likely engage high risk activities, elderly likely vaccinated weakest immune systems. main concern 40 test positive need still Quarantine 10 full days. parties engagements, especially friends relatives seen year half, goes window. job earn money working home, that's either sick leave full week wages lost. Oooh, dooooubles. Thank almost certainly right formula based based HR paper. time right think deeply really kosher? “Pastor pushes vaccines” what? people already vaccinated? Good hear. Reuters article day want clear that. God imagine coming back first show decades getting COVID. shit. also lose w climate change give fuck. Parts MO  giving liberty 

you get vaccine generally stops family dying, end. That's US even higher that. Globally 4.4 billion doses administered. course, still see happens Bill Gates flips switch.  Today: 774,000 new doses, 520,000 first doses. Similar Friday total doses lower, first doses slightly higher last week (517,000)

71% adults one dose. Six weeks someone changes mid fully vaccinated.

It’s getting worse. 

Probably cheap real estate coming Florida soon, though goes anger frustration feeling tragic. Oh present places, we're perfecting brand toxic stupidity America.  apologize advance already asked answered somewhere. didn’t see though. 

My little nephew went school Tuesday, came virus Thursday evening, sense smell taste. They’re waiting results it’s obvious we’re pretty convinced COVID. 

My question is: possible gotten school Tuesday already sick mom kept home Friday today he’s lost sense taste? symptoms appear quickly?  can't think business right would put 30 unvaccinated people confined space without masks keep whole day. business would responsibly. yet that's we're going schools.  guess feels live post apocalypse, even everyone got vaccines planned, variants keep coming booster shots keep mandatory COVID infinitely deadlier flu would ever be…?

Complete extinction virus really way funny say that. wife, 3 year old planning trip Disney October- talked monitoring situation prior committing go year. pandemics never end. Pretty clear Sinovac isn’t working downvoted, literally nurse friends telling too. ""I comorbidities!"" coming people 30+% BMI. Teachers kids certainly spread vaccinated. get matter. know it’s important kids school advocating literally mitigation health measures disgusting. There’s signs church (which haven’t attended twice since start covid) aren’t responsible according state law due illness death due covid.

I haven’t room social distancing masks, people refuse vaccinated, 350 people singing isn’t smart move. Yeah it’s pretty wild see time armchair experts enlightening us situation China… doubly us here! Next can, survive permanent organ damage cognitive deficits. back March/April, received monoclonal antibody treatment received 2nd Moderna dose 2 weeks ago.

Is trifecta protection? 💪 Wait, what?

Well really goes narrative media selling. say comments fine bunch people reacting like called mom whore something  FOMO solution lean virus, get spread much possible, hope kills Democrats Republicans.

You got done telling smart. telling this?

You can't one smart would think vaccinated, younger demographic going one dying. Sounds good. I'm definitely waiting months needed. might need fly back home soon thinking could good get way beforehand. modern version natural selection work, empathy live, many without die. There’s reason humans pre-disposed community, similar selection took place millions years ago. True. Maybe could assume looking conservative states, whites fall category?

Florida's differences astounding. 52% vs 28% usually go words actually mean. Call pedantic, idc. BC resident living near border…welcome back America! would interesting know age groups. Like many hospitalized 12 probably going make seriously sick even get it.

But every breakthrough infection chance, even small one, mutating new vaccine-resistant strain. honest concern vaccines hidden side effects. conspiracy theory truly believe suppression side effects ""The greater good"". Doctors likely report side effect vaccine people go couple days later due reaction. Especially women. think we'll see reports couple years COVID fully recinded grip. said 💯 supportive vax efforts. follow pharma research know recalls sorts unreported numbers common. worst case winter surge North Texas. think want again. Katrina, man, Obama guy filling March madness brackets. Hospitalizations measure, since majority cases vaccinated people mild. Well places like Florida started experiencing oxygen shortages “naive efficacy” mean? haven’t heard term before. Honestly got fucked. He's right pedenadtic/argumentative. clearly explained interpretation basically asked clarify due misunderstanding. Ease lmao. former says 4% Pfizer 8% Astra Zeneca, OR=100%-VE. 

HR (hazard ratio) calculated differently odds ratio little nuanced. conversation brother minutes ago. Even strictly factually correct putting headline implies important, informative surprising. Abbott leading way fear weeks that. say cost money get vaccine said people can't afford lose couple hundred dollars missing work get symptoms vaccines. Even Christian Scientists area virtual services. 

It's wild population rejects vaccines, (most) modern medicine concept disease general still like ""Nah, maybe we'll sit shit show out, y'all."" curiosity, verify people vaccinated this? actually look data institution claims vaccinated person, ask card? 


More point: 19% people CLAIM vaccinated aren't? cynical calculation kill fewer supporters votes exciting rest base. He’s fundraising stance. “church” looks like convention center casino. Trump red ain't necessarily normal red.

2018's governor race closer 2016's presididential race Florida.

Those voted Trump 2020 might show 2022 might go back blue. entitled belief clashes health community, cases use justify getting vaccinated. vaccine goes muscle, bloodstream. spikes eliminated pretty quickly mRNA disappears totally hours/few days. I'm sure anything related dose stays body 1 month after, 3–6 months security data probably hint vaccine dangerous long term. think right call spike toxin, like getting produced bacteria. protein, vaccination mostly sticks great majority part muscle lymph nodes, get journey body, surely free circulation way way lower one COVID (that infects cells lungs, instead) Well reaction 2 1 year old alone house lives herself. 

It study told safe everyone 3 years later developed blood clots many people study. take J&amp;J blood clots isn’t willing take another medicine one sure long term effects of. President doesn’t constitutional authority shut country. Im sure follow... absolutely freedom, nothing double edged there. Freedoms extend past cover parties. Intubation tube go whoosh. year 2019 9,100 children died US covid number listed would equate roughly 6 percent. US 3 million deaths per year 630,000 would ballpark 20%.

yes know spanning across two calendar years least provide bit context numbers Well dont mind little authoritarianism then. live collective society I'm frankly disgusted one wants work together make everything better everyone. need forced right thing dont really feel bad it.  Thanks. got moderna  epidemiological research what, again? focuses public health, medical science communication, simplifies extremely reject research communications. last five things gotten wrong related COVID? know republican thing. seems poor people thing too. They’re equally important attitude stigma country. love they’re impossible whoppers Say caught covid passed, would counted covid death?  I, fact, rebutted point, provided supporting evidence, repeatedly. I've quite accommodating, really.

You either disingenuous 'limited capacity' cannot reconcile connection single data point mask efficacy, itself, rebuttal required.

You agreed 'masks work' (though claimed one point) claim 'there supporting evidence masks working via mandate'. things cannot true masks work, without mandate. so, mandate thrown out; Modified, perhaps, removed propose.

Instead, hyper-focused perceived failing mechanism deployment, rather purpose effectiveness thing deployed; Resulting faulty stance rooted poor logic.

What 'baiting' people singular, credible instance, article, etc 'proof' 'Masks Mandates work compiled statistics'. 

This classic, facile argument shifting burden proof 'unfalsifiable claims'; AKA 'Russell's Teapot'. 

It makes look silly, really. Schools **ALREADY** require children MMR. Measles, mumps, rubella. Measles somehow still outbreaks America though solely thanks religious nutjobs anti-vaxers. DeSantis screw pooch. Wait til Epsilon comes along. Yep, Fauci said surgical masks practically worthless except keeping gross particles. Feb 2020

There also post vaccine infection 

People better vaccinated not

This vaccine absolve person death- still happens fraction rate would without it. Also likely populations underlying health issues.

A N95 standard .gov serious. serious. looks like natural antibodies kinda weak naturally exposed getting hit hard delta. Remember kill mutates ad tries again.

some keep saying hospitals running normal, matter evidence contrary I'm parent teacher I'm furious masks mandated schools teach kid starting first grade.
I'm terrified. People like count OG Covid deaths almost kids died make ratio bigger. Delta recently took couple months. effectively new disease context affects ages almost indiscriminately, OG Covid mostly major threat 60+ pre-existing conditions. Discarding 600,000 OG Covid deaths gets bottom line closer 30k remainder bumps threat children face today couple orders magnitude.

Which long way say dishonest.  not? substance somehow enters body. digestive system offers protection vaccination method bypasses goes directly bloodstream. Also, CDC knew spike protein toxin itself(although mRNA kinda safe tech). seen vaccines grave results decade testing reaching market. ones don't. middle age comment, barely found modify DNA. 1970s prehistoric, we're barely iron age we're mass stage 3 testing population. Anyways, I'm all-knowing god. We'll see 30 years. please, think calling someone ""a danger society"" different opinions(access different sources &amp; info). Buy legit FDA certified KN95 N95 masks. Way cheaper that, easily replaceable, certified filter 95% particles. /r/bettermasks probably point towards legit vendors. issues majority focus put vaccination. actually agree that.

Vaccine mandates though completely ignore natural immunity. ""most"" focus vaccines. dogmatic unnecessarily divisive ""vaccinated vs not"" rhetoric.

Hence suggestion focusing immunity, encompasses vaccination induced immunity well, solely that.  moderna roughly 4 weeks, pfizer roughly 3. i'm familiar others hope you’re things mental health family going suffer.

Absolutely not. mental health irrelevant compared son's physical safety.  problem synthetic control approach used way control confounding variables. words, attributes increase vaccinations study time period lottery. study even make attempt justify, much less support, assumption. 100K number probably maximum number additional vaccinations, real number likely much lower. 

You read whole study here. experience, ask insurance many pop-up vaccination centers.

If concerned it, go another state get booster. Interstate coordination vaccination records particularly good. Health experts said number factors contributed high number deaths among children. could vulnerable virus underlying health conditions malnutrition, obesity, diabetes heart disease, doctors thing don’t US…    wife small pizza shop. wife personally arranged vaccination appointments every employee would get one. seems like reasonable investment.    requiring public workplace? 

I’m vaccine mandates slightly sympathize who’ve brainwashed think it’s unsafe lose jobs public service getting it.  Still think it’s dumb didn’t 100 $10k prizes instead. Cast broader net give people winning chance. can’t even imagine absolute douche must make statement like this. picture overweight white guy barely scraping by, pickup truck really can’t afford wife large hair.  Yeah always case, even vaccines (I'm pro-vaccine btw). Obviously do, regret bit sacrifices made help others, damn, young healthy chances surviving covid always good. mean think affect young people all, fucking dumbasses reading inferring comment. know 26-year old healthy weight vegan marathon-running cousin died covid, okay?

/s There's singular ""elective surgery sector.""

It's basically 3 areas relevant.

1. ICU - rare, happen elective surgery patient ends ICU. keep ICU nurses.

2. PACU - big beds useful surge ICU status. keep nurses.

3. ""floors"" - know area actually called, big surgery center floor major set surgeries: cardiac, orthopedic, etc. Patients days weeks post surgery depending recovery timelines. beds basically worthless COVID discussion let nurses go. got first vaccine. I’m late 20s healthy, regularly work out. didn’t consider vax priority decided get today. Unfortunately nurse didn’t write date return. many weeks go back second dose? That's bad know it’s anecdotal, don’t know single vaccine skeptic says they’re waiting FDC approval.

They other, worse excuses fully expect FDC approval sway slightest, unfortunately. Yeah government quite literally committed eugenics race guise medical care I'm willing excuse vaccine hesitancy there. White people excuse. America currently committing eugenics Hispanic people speak realize needed specific example that. “BuT lOw DeAtH rATeS RiGhT?” There's world difference vaccinated person, clearly believes severity situation ""letting guard down"", someone anti-vaxxer.

If want believe behavior could possibly effect outcome, welcome continue thinking that. I'm sure why, welcome it. Based.  Can't wait see direction they'll desperately shift week passes nothing note happens.

I'm 101% convinced fake. Similar rumors spreading around week ago Atlanta would go full 2020 mode week, yet nothing big happened yet. Oh, right, look noble corporations are.

Home schooling schedule, done anytime, weekends.

Younger younger children ending hospitals. California enter indoor places without mask fully vaccinated. However, nobody enforces this, end result unvaxxed abusing walk around unmasked since there's huge overlap anti-mask anti-vax folks.
With lack enforcement comes lack motivation. Florida everything bad stupid happens. Props pastor though not. vaccinated keep getting vaccines required, fine. Anti-vaxxer's health keep deteriorating new infection die. less anti-vaxxers around higher % vaccinated people, leads higher overall herd immunity. Eventually, anti-vaxxers die off, we'll get rid virus. Incredible. made strong argument getting vaccinate within comment stating haven’t seen strong argument. Otherworldly levels irony. Downvoting. meant jab poster, who's following sub rules...but headline sucks.

I truly sick tired headlines lack proper context. article framed weirdly, least notes vaccinated 5x less likely catch COVID unvaccinated. Given lots people stop headline, however -- effectively misleading candy anti-vaxxers.

The physical barrier mask incredibly good filtration. add human factor, goes downhill. three things (in opinion) reduce effectiveness mask 1) consistently wearing it, 2) quality, 3) fit face.

In terms consistency wearing it, course difficult. want take off. also bit out-of-the-norm tell people masking home too, people exposed different vectors. hubby work two different places, thus exposed different vectors. home around different dangers exposed coworkers classmates. order get sick, masked home till got vaccine. stopped while, starting back Desantis guaranteed rampant school starting back. work upping mask game well telling employees little cloth masks won’t suffice &amp; ordered better masks. 

Quality- cloth masks. effect much less even standard medical procedure-type mask pick grocery store. choose surgical type least try ASTM level III. N95 KN95 ones mentioned CDC believe. surgical type masks comfortable readily available, N95 KN95 better.

In terms fit face, really really need mask gaps edge mask form “seal” face, airflow forced go mask, side around nose. N95’s &amp; K95’s seem pretty good this. also personally happy two brands reusable masks, LALinen Vogmask. higher level filtration along snug fit around edges, loose enough front face feel smothered.

I believe masking helps least little, possibly great deal. limited data available covid, data available viral diseases. general rule thumb lower inoculant load lead less severe illness. basis historical vaccination, small amount introduced body provoke less intense illness. even mask filter viral particles, believe sound hypothesis filter some, possibly majority, less going lungs better be. good article discussed details last year (J Gen Intern Med 2020 Oct; 35(10): 3063-3066).

Who would help? Absolutely one. 

We might save antivaxxers ignorant get vaccine screw thousands hardworking Americans save people don’t want saved. No. state mandatory vaccines yet. still waiting get full FDA approval them, even I’m sure we’d see government body go 100% route. Right seem content let private sector impose mandates work force first. 

I doubt you’ll see lockdowns unless hospital situation gets bad again. don’t think places quite level. Thank soon read first paragraph knew article junk data.

That's consequence. theoretical, seen happen world. let covid spread, happen eventually.  Viruses aren’t living things, selective pressure apply them. mutations come them, literally random.

You've described exactly selective pressure works viruses animals? Huge numbers almost completely random mutations, ones improve number descendants mutated virus/animal ones spread greater numbers, result end dominating. That's literally whole story. Selective pressure 100% apply viruses.  want see Republicans still driving anti mask/vac nonsense.  yet still get days bud. easy tell whose poor actually things compared mine well live gated communities guess. Considering studies seem suggest vaccinated greater immunity variants who've COVID, answer seems be... anytime near future near future 2022. Yeah dont know much QR code’s seems like anything static format altered - unless it’s real time verified whatever reading code, seems like would access every database. maybe I’m wrong.  I’m assuming app phone hard codes info once. haha church freaks doing? Trust science god save lives! science trust! better chance surviving doctors science together god alone think pandemics portrayed Hollywood. developed nations don’t pandemics like movies we’ve built infrastructure handle overload. Obviously push limits push limits health care professionals. many uninformed people, don’t see bodies burned street it’s pandemic. Hollywood made apocalyptic level deaths problem. get days off, often can't predict days be, especially weeks advance, low-wage jobs often subject ""just-in-time"" scheduling practices. 

This major obstacle early days vaccination campaign. less relevant vaccines available walk-in basis places, people still operating out-of-date information, others still concerned accepting walk-in vaccine can't even sure called tomorrow next day. Sincere question, people think kids been?

I'll tell you. Crammed daycares, camps, boys girls club, programs. busier crowded ever. 

Most parents can't work home afford private nanny. They're putting kids wherever can. 

I guess care spread effects teachers low wage childcare workers gotten break? Even people legit act impossible .

My dad , older brother family unfortunately thought ""I've already covid need vaccinated "" ""it bad would get vaccine would probably make sicker"" 

its another flu government trying take freedom rights away ""

Meanwhile dad mentioned day one friends almost died covid reference dad 63 older brother 38 healthiest people world.

It sucks especially considering feel comfortable seeing see nieces birthdays etc.

We covid 9 months ago know rare get reinfected would chance natural immunity alone.

My girlfriend, mom, grandma fully Vaccinated atleast know really worry getting really sick dad us ever got agreed, vaccines mandates ultimate goal, get there, need dampen spread, masks way immediately apart lockdowns. Nevertheless -- even caveats -- article still frames story ""there's really high numbers breakthrough infections!"" really, story ""vaccines still really effective, slightly less Delta.""

It's true article presents data, takeaways article takes data (emphasizing fallacy vaccines instead fact unvaccinated getting infected 5x rate) weird  Difference abortions fetuses, people support option abortion believe fetuses sentient humans. believe act murder.

Spreading COVID affects sentient feelings ability feel pain suffering. even remotely comparable situation, one party likes make one. ""pretty clear""? 15% population fully vaccinated. low vaccination rate, cases deaths going high regardless vaccine used. Even then, 70% vaccines used Pfizer, can't really extrapolate anything without specific data people used sinovac. Spanish flu kills faster spreads, therefore flu evolved bit less lethal order proliferate. Covid already spreads crazy fast kills host therefore reason become less deadly. get fatal here. could church maller church, pastor knows members (he quoted saying tired crying consoling)

Whereas bigger church, pastor might know members well know dying There's laws books yet boosters. Worst case found out, may pay shot.  sad taking people seeing friends family dying take virus seriously get vaccinated. ...in US maybe. Indeed are. makes sense. intending offend attack you. 

Just throwing idea potentially make posts accurate headlines linked article may misleading. 

Thank clarifying, posted before. can’t wait Republican tears think one two hit Delta + Employer mandates going muscle ""soft"" anti-vax crowd finally taking action.

The optimist likes think ""I'd rather die vaccinated"" crowd big fear. healthy

nice choice words. remember going church wife couple times months back. Nobody us actual church staff/pastors wore masks getting funny looks people. back, show morons simply care wears mask front them, including pastor. emulate it. ...after pushed people avoid getting vaccine... information QR code digitally signed. Totally agree you- study strong enough prove relationship taken evidence relationship regularly see older folks (parents?) people per-existing health conditions could exposing them.   Yeah - they’re ecstatic this. Remember news good, COVID dropped map them? mandating vaccine way

Masks anything comparison vaccine Moderate, level mild, implies hospitalization then, right? ask state's governor, I'm sure he'd proudly proclaim ""pro-life"" is. I'm attacking you, I'm curious view risk issues COVID vs risks vaccination. MoRon madness. answer, think surmised symbol that's right number 4. $. hospitalizations bankruptcy worthy expensive. insurance companies start putting resistance refuse take basic measures, could see problems. businesses want use freedom...(ha, freedom!) keep safe making requirements, well, already seeing playing out. establishments loose customers hotspot, wifi kind, well, could change things.  sue others creating superspreader event, theres obvious proof... litigation would deterrent, let alone result. 

many start thinking differently money involved. Again, go read room there. goers knew bands didn’t know them. acts. feel that! would lying biggest fear wasn’t getting sick, family triggered email every parent district sick kid classroom forcing contact tracing remote school. You’re alone sub mostly full americans nowdays. even recognize worldwide issue. Lol thinking child services resources Side question, talk baby mama this? She’s stuck state she’s scared virus, suspicious/scared vaccine baby’s sake.

I’ve tried talk show sources refuses read open discussing options. parent wants avoid things prevent kids getting flu? Flu f*cking sucks.

It's rhetorical question, course, obviously parents. article might looking Funny push vaccines parishoners start die. like oh shit funding passing away. Vaccines good now. people avoid X-rays break limb? Chemo cancer? Tylenol cold blood thinners heart attacks?

Yeah, poor people avoid die black person currently avoiding vaccine successfully tested deployed hundreds millions people races “because Tuskegee,” person idiot. like anti-vax protesters refusers.

Yeah, and? problem exists. Judgement help. sure trying help though. called working multiple jobs gotcha. That’s reasonable argument. masks help slow spread areas many anti-maskers/anti-vaxxers/covid deniers. Unfortunately mandating masks surefire way limit spread public. Ladies gentlemen, future unfortunately  Abbott better step game! /s Excellent title Guys, please understand using California’s numbers vaccine efficacy formula (which really simple), still means vaccines 80% effective.

Keep mind, 80% across *all* vaccines. Pfizer Moderna could higher, J&amp;J could lower, overall averages 80%. actually *good* news compare information Israel keeps putting saying vaccines aren’t effective keeping people getting sick. Let's honest, reason using Latin alphabet avoid getting T-virus. new sanctions are, think mandatory vaccinations weekly testing health workers including mental health. rule published Friday go effect Sept 30th know. Subway private company. want hire someone smokes weed, to. Now, might hard time finding people work stores, free market?  fact happened thought better stopped means slippery slope. Supporting good policy mean we're committed supporting bad policy later. throw bathwater keep baby. Like pilot trying repair malfunctioning plane beyond safe parachute altitude plane slams ground Bodily autonomy, used context attempting use in, arbitrary asinine. literally arguing people allowed infect, cases, kill others understanding bodily autonomy - individual instead collective.

This clearly strawman argument think makes sense continue conversation you.

When part point alternative means protect one's exist, individuals limit contact, simply dishonest pretend interpretation even close plane reality.

To put simply, say pretending said. put words mouth make dishonest whatever, continue respond extremely warped perception libertarianism

Im left Canadian. stop imagining everyone disagree caricature.  Oh, hear variants concern, multitude variants time, viruses quite easy mutate. think point really need make is, risk taking needs controlled variable study. see could tricky control risk taking. Perfectly valid point, question soundness conclusion, equally, can't jump conclusion pure correlation causation.   “Stupid prizes” basic ass response this.

And I’m Basic. way hospitalizations state also increased record-breaking levels six consecutive days, according data Department Health Human Services.

Despite this, people still argue surge cases. travel medicine clinic even take titer gave boosters DT, MMR, rabies last time went developing country. said likely could use topping would quicker easier give boosters rather wait test results give shots.

Insurance paid all. complaints me. keep dying still listen. know else anyone convince otherwise. Floridans?

But option governor recall Florida. least stuck next election.   thinking 12 online schooling practical solution far are, sure want risk kid really sick. also know issues stem Covid would one ones die. risk small zero I'd like vaccinated rather get Covid actually knows there'll future issues stemming even mild Covid. vaccinate flu measles even though risk dying even less... vaccinate. imagine dying said ""he less-good version another person""? best chance protection vaccinations. I’ve lurking sub months now. easily dumbest collection comments I’ve ever seen. That's asinine way interpret comment.

And instead simply posting think correct interpretation call stupid. comment addressing point public safety proves otherwise.

It doesnt seem address all. seems linked rest comment aimed first line assumption nonsensical reposted responded, means argument go direction. commented due issues posting.

It's assumption. Im saying literally observed before, noted tag alert next time saw response.

I idea would act like said based purely singular deletion comment. Commenting clearly within context previous behavioural patterns.


Anyhow, yet another comment really properly addressed anything seem increasingly aggressive decreasing depth. Completely false. give vaccine transplant patients. Can’t get compromised that.    evidence vaccinated 97% protected hospitalization breakthrough infections. Breakthrough infections still contagious. live unvaccinated child immunocompromised person could put risk. disagree OP’s statement reality statement essentially almost completely correct? never understand Reddit’s need pedantic humanly possible.   Yes, Oklahoma  K  fraud doesn’t exist doesn’t mean relax voting laws. where’s logic that? furthermore, argument voter id “poor people can’t get one.”

so pro passport, you’re essentially creating privileged america unprivileged america. really think stance, makes sense.

secure elections CITIZENS, away passports. it’s important/dangerous enough public, it’s reasonable effectively “force” people take vaccine. Technically forced, may unable work, go schools without it. sacrifices freedom part society.     Feb/March Pfizer, already getting bombarded infected co workers. I'm thinking I'm going definitely try third either MRNA, wondering wait whole six months, go it. yet do.  Bodily autonomy, used context attempting use in, arbitrary asinine. literally arguing people allowed infect, cases, kill others understanding bodily autonomy - individual instead collective.

And further, think arguments made bad faith, hypocrite stating vaccine mandate ""forced procedure"". not, choice; job equal dying, attempting portray it. There's plenty anti-vaxxers USA despite vaccine mandates, find way provide beliefs matter job them, undoubtedly continue do.

But whatever, continue respond extremely warped perception libertarianism reality individual thing matters. whole reason we're mess one states chose ignore fact locking immediately days working, instead stayed open two weeks. kept following successful strategy we'd issues right now. Yes. increase hospitalizations BC zero deaths quite now. *you* read article? Good Can’t Florida consumed ocean already? isnt good way measure.

Start clock fair time there's percent people vax'd. Reaching back March 2020 is... Kinda cheating. Start at... June 2021. look numbers.

That way vax delta numbers.

I'm sure vax still wins. let's tell fair story here. Oh yeah super scared. went drive vaccination site, made sure put car park keep feet away pedals lest stomp gas blind panic. Logic tried. Time forceful way. owned company, company get decide employ, right? 

Flatly no. extent true, obviously limits barriers workers need rights due tremendous power imbalance workers can't hire random dickwad street call quality engineer.

Absolutely. await crazy logical leap sure follow can't apply logic say employers ability refuse hire anyone want, therefore want keep job, get vaccinated?

In states currently can, states poor workers rights isnt argument able anything.

The status quo argument company picking risk unvaccinated employee gets sick makes others sicks, risk reduction measure. 

There number things companies would love would benefit company limited prevented wrong give power.

The argument deep someone's medical information company be.

If alternative measures testing masks available, reason company perfectly willing accept alternatives. course, medical information receive stored securely limited scope could possibly something employees decide stay unvaccinated, employers deal with?

Because employers employees imbalanced relationship. reason employers theory can't simply get rid *trouble makers* rallying unions protected groups etc. decided something access imbalance.

In case, alternatives exist, default employers least amount control employees possible. company drug screenings hire people able lift 60 lbs line work. 

And first one listed huge problem me. Ther eis absolutely reason company drug testing anyone operating dangerous machinery. None. Zilch. Zero.

I know expected argument convincing think status quo argument continue status quo. makes sense might well stop drug screening, physicals hiring, annual fitness tests, too.

Yes every one unless specific necessity job reasonable alternatives.

For example, guy makes sandwich subway need tested weed. Actually one tested weed given long stays system realistically becomes employer controlling time clock. US literally forcibly sterilized people past. rather inevitable slippery slope increasingly bad outcomes, tide actually reversed went direction. Large numbers always change things. 

Imagine 30,000 people died last 18 months due plane crashes. saying that’s small number. 

Same breakthrough cases 175,000,000 vaccinated. Tiny percentages still large amounts cases.     Good. Carry on. Pfizer vaccine allergic reaction. 😭😭😭

I going discuss boosters finally get see rheumatologist What’s scary idiots raising full blown tiny humans might grow dumb That’s exactly haven’t gotten flu shot, make little kids get since getting vaccines anyway. tell pro abortion people. freedom sex 0 responsibility. political.

you're year half late one.

one america's two major political parties propaganda machines politicking covid since least last march,  “Enslaved” parents’ privilege showing  organize group people leaf blowers blow bubbles back jerks. Looks like goofy Stalin. No, Delta cause severe illness pediatric hospitals filling RSV patients. Wonder listeners learn this.

Maybe many, surely some?  really taking shot co-morbidities. humongous lack actual education. temporary memorization sake passing tests instantly forgetting learned school needs better testing stats  Kind aside, I'm late-20's, COVID wake call me. pre-existing conditions overweight, made much aware one acquires pre-existing conditions. 

Simply put: I've become health conscious, want body thank decades now. saw bad habits could lead issues later life, changed them.

Since last year, I've switched diet around eat completely homemade healthy food, quit drinking alcohol completely, started exercising daily, sleeping right, drinking enough water, CONTROLLING STRESS, engaging mind, taking time kind myself, lot more.

Vaccinated, healthy, continuing wear mask!   Personally think best booster option attenuated whole virus vaccine. Would give antibodies antigen sites. Since isn’t FDA authorized attenuated virus vaccine available, I’d probably stick booster manufacturer first 2 doses with.  simply risk all, must stopped.

That's asinine way interpret comment. also frustrating clearly read comment past first sentence

My comment addressing point public safety proves otherwise. comments arguments go way

Your assumption nonsensical reposted responded, means argument go direction. commented due issues posting.  Probably wise adjustments made potential boosters possibly effective Delta.

What's approved may exactly current vaccine I'm 35, never *that* worried would die, extremely concerned getting severe long covid (and course, still somewhat concerned dying)  wonder many people message took grave fell anti-vax sword.   doesn’t. say life precious. action inadvertently cause death another, responsible life. means get shots avoid death wear masks protect fellow humans. Pretty simple that’s me. Post conspiracy reddit please, thx. Let's see spin it.. Bye bye. Sad say, would include me. glorious two weeks unmasking realizing Delta whole new game driving infections vertical again. Masked again, family. take much convincing. Also, physical attendance school starting three weeks much question.  Boomers vaccinated age group. You’ve really sitting home nothing year half? I'm gonna trust doctor random reddit person met ever, thanks input!

Also no, gain 25 pounds muscle pandemic. never said that. said would get closer target weight. 

However addition working regularly I've rode 800 miles summer alone lol. Thanks useless, baseless input. I’m Essex [original (15 seconds) TIL Limp Bizkit still touring. agree need learn live w Covid.

That’s fine long accept could get immunocompromised people, already part vaccinating.

W know vaccinated people transmitting, longer makes didn’t lock flu outbreaks covid yes?

Comparing flu Covid makes zero sense. never never valid. shit. I’m rich country though. Since young didn’t provide vaccines(our country allowed old aged people vaccinate). got covid. covid less 10% lung involvement. SpO2 didn’t drop 98. got mild fever 5 days. Still 14 days worst period life. it’s mental rather physical. Like got anxiety panic attacks. felt like going die. doctors gave Xanax Zoloft. slowly recovered. felt effects covid month. I’m alright. Thankfully didn’t get hooked benzos. got father vaccinated one dose Astra Zeneca, called weak vaccine. covid literally asymptotic. didn’t feel anything course didn’t long covid. Remember 60 I’m 22. moral story please get vaccinated soon possible. stats hospitalizations? bet asshat isn’t sending kids public school. Isn’t one old enough kindergarten Pre-k? worse, find one room catch covid inside hospital. Nothing like adding complications top existing problem. Amazing, UK? I'm Berks polar opposite - feel like local coop would walk removed perspex screens instead letting I’d burn world, vaccination distancing keep virus moving around allowing mutate? 

Had isolated locked down, know health care system would crashed millions would died - would allowed taste herd immunity, prevented variants form/take hold would still here? Yeah that’s trope that’s around forever. reality it’s much easier get someone older buy alcohol. Midwest parents buy kids booze parties. There's trend ""modified year-round schooling"".  details looks like very, nutshell means two months summer (June July) breaks throughout school year. Yes, they've away pretty much banned returning Australia since March 2020 due flight caps. essentially given two weeks relocate Australia wherever staying. not, guarantee entry even citizen coming banned country. encourage check #strandedaussies tag Twitter. Car accidents kill kids covid. gonna stop driving? Nowhere extent US (in part longer mandate ever required indoor public spaces). see social media loons, like anywhere else. vaccine uptake extremely high. even do, outcomes much better shown data. discredited thinking vaccinations sterilizing. is, vaccinated, supposedly safe infected, unable transmit virus others. think whole belief system falling apart last weeks Delta variant become prominent everywhere, though slow accept it.

Vaccines still tremendous value individual level since seem good job preventing developing serious symptoms infected. less obvious they're going case rates contain pandemic. true. There's federal law requiring advanced notice scheduling, state predictive scheduling law Oregon. Outside [Oregon employers - - change schedules little hour's notice.  would love read paper study long term effects vaccine. assume look people take vs people did. large population would hard control confounding factors. would require one particular side effect occur vaccinated population prevleant enough rise nosie. helps, Politifact [completely debunked scared care whether someone else wears mask gets vaccinated 🤷‍♂️  curious reasoning getting vaccine? anything feels like people wearing masks (at least near me) entire pandemic  Exactly. Anecdotally, almost everyone recent stories antivaxxer gets Covid dies somebody that's obese, close obese.

Everything else aside, best bet surviving Covid immediately starting lose weight. easiest thing control, biggest factor survivability, aside vaccine status age. People addicted fear. lot people they'll never get it.  went public school vaccinated … simplest 1 1 example that’s literally different one likely included future students thing sticks around.

Well, vaccinated school many classmates not. parents watch video get exemption, least Oregon. still way joined military DEFINITELY got vaccinated probably worse stuff COVID one … another pretty obvious 1 1.

Well, think makes bit sense public school vaccination, people go public schools pretty necessary get education, military choice adults necessary normal life. still would disagree mandating vaccines though.

Driver's licenses injected you. Murder laws comparable...at all. know that. Passports required. every day jump hoops little choice jump say nothing one particular thing much?

Seatbelt laws unnecessary. Mask mandates overreach. FCC regulating speech tyranny. regulations suck. say lot things. opposed them. believe vaccine mandates step though. can’t live life forever covid. Either get vaccinated carry vaccines don’t work. Sorry I’m done. followed public health protocols year, got vaccinated I’m done. won’t upend life longer antivaxxers. immunocompromised people, already part vaccinating. didn’t lock flu outbreaks covid yes? Good points around. bad upvote once. thing still missing life ability vacation US. could get POTUS me, would great :) Masking still 50/50 near me, people must still avoiding indoor events extent (we never outdoor masking people piss-poor observing social distancing, especially outdoors).  May turn lockdown unvaccinated 🤷🏻‍♀️ data percentage unvaccinated young adults (&lt;30 years) get severe illness? ideal body weight 200 lbs. That’s right border overweight someone who’s 6’3”

You also gain 25 lbs muscle pandemic. Like I’m sure put some, unless cycle year half wasn’t enough time don’t want get vaccinated? vaccinated person I’m trying understand would choose risk Covid infection. suggest learn use dictionary yourself. reliable authoritative whatever google result happen get.   Curious, based what? again...I forgot something heard couple weeks ago.... people Reno suspected gotten COVID particulate matter smoke wildfires. Could COVID hitched ride particulate matter traveled farther normal? heard maybe reason people Reno COVID transmission particulate matter made lesions nasal throat passages. Presumably that's reason would still close personal humans transmission.

I want know bar deer crowding humans. church choir practice etc. Maybe rode motorcycles Sturgis partied Provincetown I've still given believe transmission situations happens indoors bars clubs.

I want know DJ Thumper plays set brings hot da club Oh yea sure. still curious relative dangers unvaccinated vs vaccinated. Like many others I’m still middle arguing loved ones dangers vaccinated trying convince it’s time. consequences actions! They're unfair! Surprisingly Mississippi also one highest compliance rates regular vaccines: next step -- long term ramifications catching it! Florida also virtual public school option. yesterday enrollment k-8 still open. breakthroughs rare you’re talking millions vaccinations. It’s frustrating data morons use selective bias cherry pick manipulate stats fit trump zealot grand conspiracy theory. First foremost vaccine 95% effective. still falling within range among vaccinated folks preventing death hospitalizations. Number 2 vaccine designed ALPHA variant. However still remarkably well DELTA variant. 99% Covid deaths people elected get vaccinated. 98% hospitalizations people vaccinated. vaccine job chose get vaccinated. PERIOD. End discussion. debate left. data in. Science doesn’t care personal beliefs. incredibly frustrating telling low information trump zealots last 20 months take seriously. don’t. people getting hurt dying result. Furthermore gives delta variant chances mutate change potentially make current vaccines less effective. dems people common sense done part masking up, social distancing, getting vaccine exercising responsibility care towards fellow citizens. trump zealots refuse wear masks, don’t get vaccinated, don’t follow social distancing perpetuate virus. It’s incredibly annoying highlights stupidity selfishness moronic constituency said poor country wait next year get vaccine got downvotes.
Poor poor countries. Hopefully it'll burn out, im honestly doubtful true isn't. Everyone fought capacity reductions last year, too. Sorry meant anger among non-evil people. Anger anti-vaxxers blending much sadness innocent people paying price Thanks. US. Funny enough, test took basically said reactive without number know I'm lower end not. Although get cells impact well, would nice get number. I'm fence going rogue. I'm waiting fda approval whether it'll 6 months clearance get regardless passed time. lost unvaccinated 'think,' Dr. Fauci. sad. pastor contact all-knowing supernatural could warned ahead time... Right. falling excuse low-information white anti-vaxxers Florida they've fed diet batshit insanity Rupert Murdoch, Rush Limbaugh, Tucker Carlson 25 years. here? Sure, matters people think think reason. reasons generally stupid, wrong thinking wrong thinking--with life-threatening consequences--regardless efforts make contextualize understand. Sorry I'm scared vaccines masks society getting tired are. think 70% herd immunity anything, certainly highly transmissible Delta variant.

I know number came from, think case painting bull's-eye around bullet hole. single thing said incorrect. choose worry things proven valid concerns. comment downvoted? Kary Mullis HIV/AIDS denier, fact. denied climate change ozone holes well. absolutely decision, unfortunately virus decision possible kill well. Plenty people said thing found hospital near death point willing get vaccine unfortunately point little late. personally hesitant cede wide ranging powers censorship government private corporation. 'can' backfire. 'will' backfire. pandemic provided world perfect example. first days 'known' (it probably present that) pandemic attempts made [silence early whistleblowers News might produce 'public panic' irresistable draw censors. Mercifully China world general real news leaked upwards higher food chain. pure luck news transmitted also reached people influence act it. could turned quite differently. Chinese government reacted draconian measures would impossible countries. worked soon enough rest world. Without watchful eye censor news could come earlier, perhaps reacted less drastic measures. 

During warime governments typically react strict censorship. 'public panic' excuse operates full steam situations. difference enemy wins battle nothing much done. Dissemination news disease, however, reaches ears eyes many, many people *can* something. Beyond public panic people cite potenial harm falsified information may cause. protect problem, however, inescapable censors see duty much broader context. baby bathwater story.

There alternative censorship. Adding 'public health warning' items internet act lessen impact falsified news. Take example highly placed politician tells falsehoods benefit. Simply tagging link sites documenting said culprit told 30,573 lies course 4 years is, end, effective simply blocking noise. every time culprit lies astounding record available new lie. live Montreal too. worry much  Regarding last sentence, mean masks &amp; social distancing official policy governments/companies/organisations individual/family decisions level? term social distancing defined, defined policy behaviour? Yes did. say it’s clear concise deaths related vaccine it’s also clear concise not. timeline still works said 2-3 weeks week two ago. problem US massive every region timeline. south got hit first peak first. starting hit mid Atlantic north east. probably won’t peak mid Atlantic north east weeks clear speaking general. I’m involved accessibility housing market, lot predatory shit going place. I’m familiar whole vaccine thing specific circumstances since people degrees public health involved I’d effective sticking lane. I’d say he’s heavily relying state republicans witness person runs President. hear kept us open, said masks, made impossible people get unemployment. won’t see sick kids, dying elderly, overworked frontline, evictions. Yeah, also given OK children 12 get vaccine. point i'm ask son's doctor something do. wish could give plasma blood piece mind (we're compatible enough give blood, O+). Agreed. We’ll need measures deal it. 2019 normal impossible addition Covid. lot vigilance background stuff won’t see day day life, times increased spread choice mask up. hope avoid business closures. I'm expecting deluge votes. Even though 100% vaccinations. Thank reply. Labeling conspiracy probably bad terminology. think GPs getting room deciding report negative side effects. believe dismissive complaints (""no way vaccine"") would consider recording way. Either believe statically possible, want scare people away vaccine, maybe there's real mechanism report/log information easily accessible source researchers. fun start becoming mandated jobs, school, concerts, restaurants, etc.. Yeah entire church goes home turns Fox Friends, message gets lost pretty quick. No, you. poor people avoid die earlier.

But they're poor, believe X-rays racist plot oppress black voters something. conflating problems here, one systemic (the American for-profit healthcare system unjust) one individual (people choosing believe crazy conspiracies). and? problem exists. Judgement help. sure trying help though.

We're Reddit, dude. Nothing either us saying ""helping."" accurate diagnosis matters. diagnosis removes agency valorizes conspiracy-mongering endemic within group people care about. Based largely pre-Delta data.

Delta different. understand current moment, important realize extent denialism powerful current history American public health.

This inscribed big plaque lobby every Public Health Department US.  Yes, me, want know vector since we've told less six feet case, hard transmit outdoors unless rather crowded setting.  Maybe trusts obstetrician, might agree talk doctor it. sure bring statement professional organizations visit.

Or another idea, trusts obstetrician show professional society obstetricians says well professional society obstetricians specialize high risk pregnancies (SMFM ). Two weeks today: First Covid death commemorative march recorded.

A month that, another march.

And on, on, on. didn’t die. (I don’t mean flippantly, promise.) got another shot fine. went sounds scary, I’m going totally Invalidate fear said heard stories people dying shot *and* that’s leading hesitancy.

Where’s fear getting Covid? huge risk factor really sick person long hauler get Covid. 

I got pretty sick second vaccine. immune system fights like woah everything. sucked. gonna lie. dying Covid or, hell, occupying bed space don’t need taken shot worse getting sick reaction shot.

She fine second shot. kid likely fine. Think versus caving fear. don’t get J&amp;J. There’s vaccines get.

If daughter went *still* wants get vaccinated, **really really really** need get shot like yesterday. yeah ""save vaccines others"" narrative falls flat even 50% population gotten vaccinated, free service open anybody wants take it. might practicing physical distancing aren’t practicing social distancing. were, wouldn’t holding in-person services  AntiVa dosent care die themselves.



They sure care health safety society desperately want part of. Kentucky residents infected SARS-CoV-2 2020, vaccination status reinfected May–June 2021 compared residents reinfected. case-control study, unvaccinated associated 2.34 times odds reinfection compared fully vaccinated.

Go get vaccinated. understand. son TON food environmental allergies, I’m terrified gets vaccine. (He’s 12 isn’t eligible yet). However, getting COVID terrifies lot more. Unfortunately situations, pick lesser two unpleasant options. COVID killing people left right, isn’t, it’s often causing long term issues. daughter get better. know reactions scary I’m trying downplay it. absolutely wouldn’t let cause protect others blame like, people right choose goes bodies. Yeah, that's I'm puzzled. What's vector Victor? question children's deaths hospitalized kids increasing. Google local children's hospitals see affected. Delta contagious kids spread more. One strangest things whole pandemic much rabid covid enthusiasts hate us loving wanting die.  Well isolation period ended yesterday feeling 85% normal, congestion. First days felt like flu aches, chills, etc. congestion ever since. thinking turned corner tightness chest shortness breath :)

Fully vaccinated Pfizer back April  get that. feel lot less morons too. it’s flight US think rest easy. it’s outside country understand requirements you’re going come back.  Ask illegals spread covid different average unvaccinated Floridian? certainly aint 50k illegals sent daily French here.

They say sanitary pretext. Politcians + policemen + truckdrivers even mandated vaccinated.

If vaccinated people able spread virus would make sense. that's case all.

 governement media pushing fact vaccinated people super safe need wear masks so. unvaccinated = bad people spreads everything like rats. makes sense point lol.

The sanitary pass exclusively politic way health related. still go away. specifically I'm really mandates. People vaccine still spreading vaccinated yet people want wear masks all. I've started wearing n95 douse everything sanitizer constantly go store. got vaccinated, yup.  work shitty factory turnover terrible doubt company going mandate anything. backwoods idiots would leave can’t afford right now. Hopefully I’m wrong though.  IMO type conspiratorial attitude coping mechanism improve mental health. feel like addressing root cause mentalities meaningful helping eliminate misinformation. exact line ""reasoning"" soon-to-be-ex roommate constantly spouts. throws little extra 5G Jewish Child Molester Reptilian Illuminati Fauci. One important distinction here: gives *states* authority mandate vaccinations. States effectively unlimited powers US Constitution, limited Bill Rights. federal government, hand, limited [Enumerated 

Now, maybe SCOTUS would find fed govt it, it’s untested thus far. right now, we’d probably still looking many states south opting go it. It’s stressful AF  What's vaccination rate Florida, excluding Miami Dade Broward, many Democrats likely skewed statewide data significantly higher? Can't wait idiot antivaxxers try flee country met staff asking vax passports board.

Sad defeated they'll mutter ""b-but m-m-my HIPAA rights."" Says person afraid needle. Nice Half-life reference. ended ""and based"" authcenter moment course. That’s point Here's good explanation: That'd probably make happy they'd think end times coming. tiering ...everyone loves talk flordia handled everything continued pack beaches Disney world Every spring summer  Here's good explanation: Fully vaxxed. got covid last week first time.
Fucking hell. Lmao Actually unvaccinated rounded sent hospitals Strange. thought flu. dont remember ERs ever shut flu.  Abortions contagious ""If vaccinated refused entrance schools...""

That's exactly issue. People dogmatically bucketing others either pro anti vaxx. nuance. replies I've received confirmed suspicions. fuck imply infection parties?  Stop crying. People right make dangerous, ignorant, selfish wreckless decisions kill you. Suck up. Bad people rights ya know? /s I'm seeing little support initial assertion bullets flying mandates.    US, majority Republicans believe hoax, vaccines bad, number crazy conspiracies. encounter people daily basis. source Delta causing severe illness? Jesus, one day? Absolutely insane 😲 Dude, EARTH making think COVID *isn't* described second paragraph?

Not saying *is*, governments around world already nefarious. Especially China, shit came from, *still* confirmation virus came about. Could've fabricated emergency fuckin' know. blame though? don’t believe forcing vaccine people hey end dead made dumb choice, thats also choice. give people free sausage 💉 , work well Germany. mask usage Florida really low. ran errands today every place even 25% mask usage. busy Lowes workers, myself, 1 guy wearing masks that's it.  conservative mother told applauds DeSantis running things shouldn’t believe reported numbers cases. I’m also Moderna, feb March. directly exposed early week. son went get tested Covid negative. people non vax positive. ❤️ hope reassures little. Lupus, I’m #3
ASAP! Honestly, feel really bad him. Even media totally misrepresents/cherry picks say sensationalistic headlines. must exhausting deal bullshit puts daily.   Korean here. things well start since they've exp health crises like swine flu, bird flu, etc. However well gave lots people false sense security thought way soon. vaccine roll hindered (or bungled depending political alignment) conspiracy theories too.

They started race well thought sprint clear thing marathon"
