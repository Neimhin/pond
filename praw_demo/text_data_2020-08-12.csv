That's fine well replace you.

I work either.

Okay that's two new hires.


400 teachers later:

Umm maybe reconsider this? lol ‚Äúcould‚Äù headlines. Anything COULD happen. Lazy journalism opinion, click bait. mean seems generally accepted timeline around here, although earlier today got downvoted moon saying first time happened. yeah, March (even January things looking lot better tbh) think really handle thing. know sub pessimistic I‚Äôm confident saying that. Great hear honestly, hope experience. Im assuming hotels fully pandemic aware least can‚Äôt imagine scary would be. sorry. Wishing well means anything. Second week Feb, gone thru Atlanta Lax international airports previous weekend, got really sick. Negative flu strep diagnosed bronchitis 5 days tiny cough. Every symptom Covid, had- fever week half, extreme fatigue, felt like elephant chest, horrible cough, short breath, oxygen levels going walked, more. couldn‚Äôt take full breath 6-8 weeks after. test negative antibodies week test came out. doubt got airport. practice agree, cross immunity, given many prisoners years, may less likely exposed whatever disease cross reactive

That said doubt it‚Äôs 20%. Given Cleveland Clinic says antibody tests, herd immunity achieved NY, it‚Äôs number cases far 20% Dogs cats become infected. Felines susceptible dogs; virus harder time replicating inside canines whatever reason embrace eye roll? Im embracing eye roll. I'm supposed believe Trump received letter read it? That‚Äôs perfect argument extremely, extremely strict complete shut 8 weeks, keeping borders closed over.

If somehow knew impossible make vaccine flattening curve much less attractive. real options let rip go full NZ completely crush it. accurate tests?

How contagious virus?

How accurate (if all) know anything Williams always sad someone dies, would interesting self-own conservatives, judges keep getting covid wearing masks staff wear them. simply cannot afford continue feeding little ones. Teachers need us support polls, mercy financial responsibility like people. End right work laws support politicians support funding good schools good teachers. Fox friends says normal sniffles... Russia? took snowden. know next nothing hockey yet visit Philly, man, fucking love Gritty. well known America actually Americans per capita country. linked especially bad outbreak. lockdowns kill well. 

At least part undercount lockdown. Marshall accurate, IMHO. Interestingly, that's averages work. states (yours) low unemployment payouts, states higher. see ""tremendous"", instantly know is. I'm sorry what? speaking dealing customers attitudes reinforced.  needs consequences shit.  struggle decisions, get easily discouraged too. Lots depression anxiety, one favorite ideas animating.

I like idea Machinima style (8-bit/16-bit video game sprites) original hand drawn (drawing style opposed using existing models).

My lack motivation, constant mood swings, plus overly competitive field? case YouTube, unreliable income, any.

I feel like life fierce competition, get by, I‚Äôm unmotivated depressed really work hard.

Maybe make cartoon that.... lesson objective tough can't let guard down. right effort get back control. least partially things.

Covid fairly high r0, meaning percentage immune would quite high create herd immunity.

But if, distancing measures, masks etc., drop 40 fair bit, would take far LESS immunity push one.

We've seen several cities areas stall around 20-25% mark, seem areas exercising least distancing. confined areas distancing difficult impossible, like cruise ships, infection rates often much higher. 

My suspicion combo 25% immunity low moderate social distancing that's trick. think totally let guard went right back way things would see uptick--i think there's probably limit much measures relaxed. I'm watching closely cautious optimism. feeling I've since London NYC showed similar seroprevalence. 

My *worry* that, bears out, reinforce belief seemingly held lot people get away giving shit others everything works end case. I'd take less death, obviously. Impossible tell. Asymptotic cases, people Jan/Feb...we don‚Äôt know true number people infected.

Even new research anti-bodies fade (with looks T-Cell immunity kicking in), easy way describe immunity percentages at.

Also, new disease, herd immunity could contained lower level (40%-50%) rather higher levels. don‚Äôt know.

Let‚Äôs say 50x cases reported.
We hit 1 billion people infected...that‚Äôs 12% immunity.

Math: 20.53 million cases worldwide x 50 = 1000 million (1 billion). Total population roughly 7.8 billion. 1/7.8= roughly 12.8% really couldn't. maybe 25% NYC's population it. Herd immunity would require somewhere around 70%. would arrested? holy shit, that's pathetic hilarious would better suit voter base too, since supporters tend lean hard towards anti-vax side line demographic really going interested vaccine begin with. legally enfore people wear pants public mask? Stand yourself. one else going you. Certainly government definitely employers. Working customer service mean ok treated like shit high time made clear customers. live Australia work retail. true too. Consistently get screamed middle aged women rarely demographic. also steal nearly much teenagers do. elected post normally recall legislation.

(well... 48 36 152?, since listened stats.) shame. one good thing COVID-19 tell actually decent person not. example, actually predict who's probably shitty person inconsiderate, like maskless fools walking wrong way one way aisle grocery store. kind disappointing, listening Smash Mouth anymore now. mean.......  Mods busy, trying keep concern trolls. Try adding 33 weeks pregnant mix. whole thing really altered view lot people... I‚Äôve serve people job don‚Äôt know email texting work, *refuse* learn it. (and quote) ‚ÄúI‚Äôm old school.‚Äù aunt 60s knows use iPhone; learn adapt times, old man.

Sorry, ended venting much. Ah, still chicken shit say live from, yet problem trash talking. coward. Texas‚Äôs cases dropping official statistics? It‚Äôs really news anyone believing anything Russia says idiot.

It‚Äôs fact. making worse. im restaurant industry tell you, years, people didnt give shit us behind counter. routinely shit on! ""make food! peasant trash loser society!""

now!? magnified TEN FOLD. people even jackasses. dont care. would think different...but nop course does! üòä
Praying hard means nothing though faith. People like however, proper representation Christians way. There's entire department called human resources. literally manage humans, resource within company. Like ink toner, copier paper. Herding humans telling work great company, need put smile show everyone good, happy worker bee are. Imagine linking shitty comment thread immediately get dunked on. got news you, US dispensable, many us think are. Shame one end knives necks. deserve oxygen. brother called test KY. told even Humana he'd pay roughly $100 front try get insurance co reimburse. said f-it refuses get tested now. I'll bet he's one. Whhhhyyyyy\~\~!!!!! stop them? FREEEDOM! love god, let die off. constitutional right. love large media organizations owned billionaires ""left wing"" thing conservatives seriously worry about. Yes, left-wing billionaires want wealth taxes seizing means production. bit like Marxist human resources officer, vegan butcher. really hope that‚Äôs true man. hope pray works. come March, year thing, still aren‚Äôt woods don‚Äôt otherwise ha e clear indication we‚Äôre approaching end, don‚Äôt think mentally take anymore. live Russia well. Karelia. Private clinics Helix tests since april, far remember. pretty cheap prise. get pardon, Trump pardon them. According President USA authority truth news said bleach miracle cure Covid-19.

You gotta drink it. 100% assure die ingestion substance virus die well. I've Vaped ever since quit smoking cigarettes. leave car wear mask public, fucking around heart scarring... also suggestion came frozen goods.

There basis currently make claims came from. Yea? article? one guy posted estimates 2019? 

I'm one whos angry. guess continue live ignorance.

Let tell calculate percentages. 

First turn data fraction. 

Then divide top number bottom number get amount less 0. Multiply 100 get percentage. Let show you.

Total US Covid cases 5,200,0000
Total US Covid Death 165,000

This case deaths top number cases bottom number. 

So 165,000/5,200,000 = 0.0317

0.0317 √ó 100 get percentage 3.17% 

Meaning mortality rate Covid 19 3.17%

You following? pretty simple stuff, maybe grade 3 math. 

And look, here's source backs yours? Better Fox. parents children immigrants great depression. Whether makes harder easier debate, I'm absolutely positive harder nearly everyone else time period compared Karen's need haircut. job. like remove masks eat. hope get arrested hope die. people ""rights"". sorry victim. don‚Äôt think literally anyone thinks 10 million. haven‚Äôt seen expert guess anywhere less 25m that‚Äôs lowest I‚Äôve seen I‚Äôm reading 1918 Influenza, one things virus did, ‚Äúdisappear‚Äù seem disappear, several months, reality never disappeared. mutating/ call ‚Äúpassage‚Äù- (it‚Äôs virus adapting host species) first wave relatively weak version virus human body could fight, several passages virus grew stronger human host (presumably transmitting asymptomatically) stronger version virus emerged, one uncontrollable (at time). worry SARS-Cov-2 this. worry that‚Äôs happening NZ, never ‚Äúdisappeared‚Äù percolated. Interesting!!  always feel bad unfolding 3 shirts... best fold back, know don‚Äôt good enough job it. Thanks sorry Swedish quite many us worried virus less isolating ourself. virus get much chance infect maybe 50% us. Even total isolation many limits contacts.

In summertime Swedes meet outdoors time. people seeing others indoors minutes. likely enough superspreaders superspreaders.

And maybe quite vulnerable (by behaviour) meet superspreader already done sick already.

Schools open next week month summer people often meet indoors. interesting see happens then.

Badically; guess virus infectious outdoors summer. people world take pride wearing clothes wkth flags them. heck, europe almost everyone soccer shirts fashionable national flags and/or colors them.

Again, patriotic equal racist. black guys wearing shirt? uncle toms? elected officials work us. Never forget that.  Also money spend? money theirs.  plenty options involve voting writing stern letters elected officials likely never see care.

The way mess way founded country first place.

Again, now. there's ~16% unemployment middle pandemic. Supply demand real.

I guarantee companies could outlast people literally food miss check replacing people want eat. NYC could close So, big difference viruses contagious. Kids spread higher rate, even rate death little lower.

I get saying; commenter bit hyperbolic, really think point pretty simply followed. say unsure relevance comment I'll explain:

What making analogy. basically, many parents seem acting way exemplifies understanding situation. comparing something bit tangible, roughly equating harmfulness radiation virus. Hope helps.  Even north North Korea cases. New Zealand good run. That's scary. They're already drinking kool-ade, want *extreme* kool-ade. One special kind stupid buy Grenon's garbage cure.

I‚Äôd rather die continue like this. yes I‚Äôve reached nothing helps. I‚Äôm still waiting answer dude border quarantine slipped 

there's currently evidence Brazil import America US needs lot major reform. I‚Äôm saying boomers are, ‚Äúold-fashioned conservatives‚Äù (I‚Äôve known support things like universal healthcare) think boomers die off, new generation political field, serious progression much likely. actually quick look US states see may 20% number.

Bet that's happening over. [It's smart Well, given there's significant gap state reported COVID deaths CDS's excess deaths (Florida reporting 40% COVID), true death toll probably 20,000.

So, yes, hide deaths. Here's recollection went down: started severe mask shortage. meant front-line health workers exposed. general public buy mask could, hoard (like toilet paper) people really needed (Doctors Nurses) would even worse off. Fauci come say, ""We failed produce enough masks,"" because...well, politics. instead said, ""the public need wearing masks right now."" outright lie: Americans fact better protecting health workers without. never told whole truth either. lot people already forgot it. 'placebo' different already-existent vaccine? Pneumococcal something?  feel like you‚Äôre deliberately ignoring fact virus could simply spread person person, starting cook back ending customers front. point even trying make? It‚Äôs really weird keep trying hard dunk person like they‚Äôre kind covid denier absolutely case. Like said comment conveniently ignored; chill fuck out. country beyond repair think way valves work allow breathe pretty easily, close breathing in. protect you, really protect anyone you, least, much. 

I N95 valve works like that. bought Home Depot several years ago sanding bunch drywall. mask like makes sense capacity since purpose prevent breathing bad crap. able breathe easily nice bonus case. Atlanta's mayor one 12? Mayors mask mandates place. Kemp's hometown Athens mask mandate (that nobody enforced regardless tried). mayor sued wanted GAG ORDER black female. also vocal called Kemp bullshit often.

Interesting. white, *should* get Vitamin need half hour's summer sun exposing head arms. coloured take longer.

So wonder deficiency? might exception. anecdotes data.

Nevertheless I‚Äòm happy you! Hope stay safe! ""Non-essential"" meant ""you die right away now"".

Most procedures delayed essential overall long term. think people got impression things put boob jobs-- no, stuff like hip replacements heart surgery, kind heart surgery could technically wait couple months. ‚ÄúThe point echoed World Health Organization, notes ‚Äúcurrently evidence people catch COVID-19 food food packaging‚Äù‚Äù

We extremely unlikely meet redhead fun trivia question um, I'm sorry, remove posts verifiably proven information fit narrative? late party. mean told months ago? kidding! Yum Even 50% extremely promising great! That‚Äôs huge breakthrough deleted comments, always proves point better ""Under right circumstances, 10 15 minutes sun arms legs times week generate nearly vitamin need. Unfortunately, ""right circumstances"" elusive: season, time day, live, cloud cover, even pollution affect amount UVB reaches skin. What's more, skin's production vitamin influenced age (people ages 65 generate one-fourth much people 20s do), skin color (African Americans have, average, half much vitamin blood white Americans), sunscreen use (though experts agree extent sunscreen interferes sun-related vitamin production).""

I'm fair likely push extreme metrics vitamin production. Mid day Canada Toronto, get enough 10 min problem. got buried PA yokels Lebanon county. Researchers can't find conclusive proof works. dropped official US government guidelines take care mouth.

Let's say arguments sake.

Godwin's law pal, gotta bring Hitler. law could've seen coming?! /s think less random people getting tested people actual exposed symptoms still tested getting results back less 3 days now, that's net positive.

Having 800k tests 8% positivity rate literally useless takes 6 days get test result. I'd rather 15% positive 3 day turnaround. least actually something turnaround. Fauci said testing useless turnaround long, right.

Nobody cares 1 million tests 3% positive rate takes 10 days get results.

Also note: ideally would national policies avoided bottleneck first place, I'm trying deal reality fantasies. UNBELIEVABLE!

What's wrong people? fucking minds? 

Not exposing kids, families kid. 

IRRESPONSIBLE! phase 1. Really safety. fact there‚Äôs robust immune response promising bonus phase 1 think joking. "" opposite Mensa Densa"" 


I think love you. found RNA, there's evidence virus found still viable infectious. means someone coughed point, already knew. know long virus survive outside human body surface, maybe seconds, maybe weeks. Nobody's done study find yet. Finding virus surfaces different actually infecting people surfaces. needs get lungs damage, easiest way get lungs breathing in. hard surface, first get hands, dig deep nose, even chances pretty low get infected way virus surface, nearly impossible get airborne again. CDC's initial ""wash hands"" campaign done absolutely nothing control spread, 100% mask usage shown able reduce spread nearly 0, even matter masks cause people touch face more, difficult transmit touching surfaces. H1N1 also turn deadly. knew I'd drive states talking about, I'd legitimately buy full-on HAZMAT suit respirator piss degenerate creatures off. Wow. wow. That's said. Reading comprehension? 100,000 deaths without shutdown, probably decent fractions population getting sick.

A bad flu... new guy almost 200,000 dead (there's undercounts) well 10% population infected. Current situation definitely severe. Ah take joke back. Sorry hear bullied it. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* That's get blood drawn injection. mind done even mind pain.

These hyper closed countries one ever goes to. could under-reporting things some, hiding bodies they'd need par seen numbers India?

The outlook great there, per-capita basis still even bad Spain there's dozens countries worse. US current level new cases per capita since March. means Covid19 hoax lunatic. real shit. wife ER nurse NY I've heard stories. vet overwhelmed it. Scared come home give kids. awful. 

But Spanish Flu killed millions people (17.4) population 2 billion. population 7 billion population density much higher now. 

Is medical advancement really enough explain away difference death count?

1918

Global pop - 1.9 billion. 
Pandemic deaths - 17.4 million


2020

Global pop - 7 billion
Death toll (so far) 750k

From understand found effective treatment, doctors struggled fight it. I'm seeing makes sense 

(I'm also scientist medical professional WAY LIKELY someone could explain it)

Living non-existent world like claiming world would better without crime, obviously would yet are, living every day. Stop thinking terms ifs distract problems hand provides false support thos claim ""I would've done better."" Hindsight 20-20, claim would've done better. 

As NZ comment, many reasons island helped solve crisis (small population, high respect trust government, social safety nets, global economic hub etc.) things would great US had, dont changes would happened night worthless act like even realm possibility. 

As last point supporting people; nets put place, people offered support home, enough? Probably not, lets pretend dem president independent president would've magically said jobs essential, everyone stay home pay you, never would've happened, would've zero incentive people go work support supply chain need survive would they? Granted, gone in, would've food, one service electricity water lines, one deliver medicine etc. many people need work (mcdonalds workers, dunkin) no, many positions actually essential functioning society. 

The farmers situation completely different well explained here:  timeline issue, bureaucratic one. bad country transparent media closest thing control group world.  Swedes healthy - Swedish government values health public. Maybe means masks S/D mitigation tools. world owes Sweden debt gratitude sacrifice control group. Without assistance (and deaths) would able create pretty graphs showing effect ignoring virus. ostrich strategy ostrich strategy worker, restaurant worker, delivery person

These jobs already sucked major ass prior COVID. Tell Thailand Vietnam. cold. Let's stay inside keep warm. hot, let's go inside air con. far easier **an island** bit player world economy. country like US 25% world GDP 3,000 mile porous border politically difficult close faces entirely different set circumstances. it's, ""hospitals get paid report deaths covid related, numbers inflated"". think almost order magnitude London deaths yea 2% would devastating one take lightly. think Asian flu much better example forgetfulness . . Spanish flu great-grandparents' day, never heard them, ""living"" memory were. something knew about, picked cultural osmosis. think I'm unique regard. Last year said ""Spanish flu"" good chunk population English speaking country would probably vague notion referred deadly worldwide influenza epidemic end World War I.

In contrast, literally idea world gone Asian flu, read articles coronavirus hit. Youre correct. sure whole standard surgical mask epitome protection came from. surgical mask leak particles microdoplets vented mask would. people ignorant topic, many research papers past made this. (In ""source please"" learn use search engines) understand absolutely bonkers entire situation sounds people countries.

I hate job stay health insurance - translates ""My emploeyer whatever want control health""

""Only ended costing $400, would thousands otherwise"" Would free I'm from, even coming street. thing seems distrust default mode thinking us citizen they'll value picking ""products"" whatever organized large scale them. end expensive even efficient.

I'm honestly tired willful ignorance readily available information otherwise intelligent people plain stupid freedumb mask fighters. Ok, mask people MUCH worse. 

But overall, disappointment people general grows constantly. think I'm genius, even consider well read. cannot believe many people spout total bullshit like fact, includes scientists. recently month ago CERTAIN coronavirus spread aerosols. ones denied asymptomatic spread CDC, WHO, Koch Institute, New England Journal Medicine.

Pfizer vaccine take neither could wife trying kids right now. tip otherwise make 7 dollars hour. use services dont tip scum earth all. raised question legitimacy elections. 

How Barack Obama get elected twice, elections legitimate? (Since seemed imply Bush got elected twice legitimate.).  Yeah shock government completely willing let shitload us means don‚Äôt spend money people. Bold anyone assume hourly workers US ever treated like humans. That's capitalism baby! Clinton well might have; didn‚Äôt follow politics much age. would 6th grade, maybe? 

I know Clinton left country surplus, rather debt.

Well technically Wild Wild North, South, East West.

But feel man, he‚Äôs trying help, yet people use scapegoat anger frustration. anybody taking scrutiny blame, Trump, China. 

We spend trillions defense, yet somehow never actually fully protects anyone. Well almost never anyone.... think see service industry workers full-blown people; see us, personhood occur them. sturdy enough climb on, rule, practically do.

I sometimes wonder even realize infect them, too. asymptomatic Sars2 sick Covid19. course catch virus multiple times question get sick?   Good idea, try that! theory is: wearing mask dehumanizing. makes look like everyone else. lose individuality. Wow. make logical sense though. unseat bootlickers need, trade states weight, Kentucky, Alaska, etc.

If rigged would look different. people absolutely vote. That's far truth happens America. Service employees treated worse dirt. can't deny this. obviously true bad actors around world exploiting pandemic consolidate grip power. fact he's Republican goes without saying. got looted, one coworkers died covid, regularly harassed anti-maskers, still denied raise minimum wage. quit end week. I‚Äôve waiting 13 days test results Denver. numbers wrong. remote check in? idea going hotel talk anyone always dream, pandemic customer right assault give death threats.

No wonder America giant shithole. People like allowed walk around zero consequences. Found chemist Walmart workers feel distribution centers. I've felt way while, past, whenever started thinking it, I'd sort talk ledge, told people considered times they've lived in, fucked up/gradually going hell. uh, *really* difficult talk ledge lately. hate talk people grocery store, whenever option always chose self checkout. also worked grocery store disliked forced interaction people day No. actually agreement. think US lockdown worked lot value studying could better. Neither us thinks ethical hold experiment expect experimental group come irreparable harm. 

I wanted butt argument could agree deliberately putting risk people COVID-19 bad idea! months now, might ethical pay group anti-maskers stay home month see avoid getting COVID-19. now, really ethical way go correlation causation. 

After all, find literally anything increased around time autism diagnoses started increasing get correlation. point good science correct well taken! fucked up. yea, probs useless arguing him, dude vendetta NBA k. better option given election 3 months? stupid comments make? never have. feel like comments missing half point article. Yes, customers rude ever, article explaining complete picture people like husband, department manager big grocery store, stressed. 

He comes home headache everyday. Customers (and management) dont understand supply chains work, items available. hero pay temporary, worth price, cutting hours doubling responsibilities make profits. 

On top extra cleaning, dealing unruly customers, dealing stock shortages, cut hours help staff, also told multiple times day long make store look ""grand opening"" ready. forget calling sick, pretendlike covid constantly demanding employees (who already compliant) wear mask.Anything make look bad horrible idea.

Yes, grocery store employees always treated like crap, tenfold high unemployment everywhere. know shit day, family take care going anywhere quit get fired unemployment job opportunities. Good thing brother works lab tech results came back within next day.. 


In reality, tests take week come back. know alot labs. Many close 10k samples day. would discrimination allowed fly autistic. wasnt. wasnt allowed fly wear mask. I‚Äôm confused sentence? What‚Äôs wrong? enough save That's assault terroristic threats. Zero tolerance. Call cops

Immune genius: FIGHT ME!! Hey, I'm also missed boat FFP2 / N95 face masks can't find anywhere. Could tell got yours? Even want play card, there's still figure Office National Statistics, based death certificates, rather positive tests, recorded 56,770 covid deaths till 31 July. 'containment unit' 4 star hotel meals delivered ok Korean culture go multiple restaurants night. pretty surprised first. mainly like eat drink, restaurants fit bill better simple bars. 3 restaurants night uncommon. Okay you‚Äôre even open idea. We‚Äôll stop here. Maybe think it. Hey Forest, could leave phone home went talk latest alien snake demon semen medicines? Yur sneaky.  states calculating deaths differently NY early impacted states. There's way many infected daily long hit thousands fatalities day number keeps rising matter hours Point is, millions people tested positive UK. 373,000 people tested positive far. small sample 373,000 people, 50-100 deaths per day until... yesterday. people get killed car crashes? 

With new method, people die 28 days testing positive counted covid deaths. Even though people, even famous (example: Nick Cordero) died covid 28 days testing positive. It‚Äôs right article. antibody tests good enough used surveillance tests. study accurate.

‚ÄúSeparate studies, also unveiled Thursday, evaluated range finger-prick home antibody tests found results reliable enough given government approval widespread use, officials said. tests still deemed suitable surveillance studies Imperial research.‚Äù number keeps rising matter hours  *en masse suspect lizard person, wearing donald trumps skin (hence tanned leather look) intent wiping humanity. tiny hands evidence t-rex genes. mannerisms lizard like. would evil superhero name be?

EVERYTHING, mean EVERYTHING, political statement content character days. Working intended? highly doubt intention system allow candidate lose wide margin nationally popular vote still win electorally eking smallest vote margins 3 states. 5 times history popular electoral vote winners same, twice modern history, times benefitted party.

But vote change it? Yeah, no, requires constitutional amendment. bar passing one high none us see one lifetime ever again, especially considering polarized nation 7 last amendment passed 35, salary limits. There's way we're something drastic fundamentally altering electoral college, country far divided point. can‚Äôt learn much herd immunity prisons. live close theory everyone could get people could recover become immune individuals slowing spread.

If learned anything seems like third people seem naturally immune, level herd immunity need slow spread amount varies based situation. Oligarchy full swing right now. arent even hiding more. essential workers walk wages working conditions improve appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Dude looks like BFG. Statement confirms he's smart. Brave say reddit without called fat-shamer natural selection action. indirect consequence covid, sorry hospital bed due covid, still due covid.

Definitely riskiest exposure. Yeah case fatality rate someone 30s around .2% much lower reality get people less likely tested. dont understand need consistently twist numbers pretty good idea fatality rate. saying requirement face covering months old. taken long determine specific they're working quite slowly.

At speed they'll probably able prove Covid-19 potentially lethal by... January next year? im understanding right. somebody previously sick another coronavirus. possibility antibodies formed infection least partially effective covid 19. thats case. one could theory exposed covid 19 protected enough body make specific covid 19 antibody test would looking for. would skew numbers lower.

I think said here. mean... love trying give benefit doubt, literally said ""plantation owners essential workers"", thus comparison direct one, rather inappropriate tbh. obviously try bleach tho.... sayin' little hypocritical. actually pretending they're awesome job. call ""BLM Workshops"" something. Nobody would dare complain. story over? Schools open parts Canada spring issues. There's lots science look at, one doctor CNN chooses select.

Also, Gupta points inflammatory disease. far 100,000 children US tested positive. 500 condition recovered (one almost died) odds less 1:100,000 serious complications. dangers kids way worse corona, including virus's.

Children drown across USa spring everyone water nothing else do. school. far, lockdown killed kids US Corona has.

And BTW, TONS money afford huge house, area country nice weather kids outside day long private tutors, tennis courts social bubble kids want hang around ""estate"" day long. never mentioned would like people means (= people America) kids home year - educational standpoint, mental health financial. rich perspective, easy make decision. hand less people die traffic accidents, infectious diseases on. tiny fraction however someone test positive stay alive ventilator weeks counted. Whatever true number excess deaths, directly indirectly caused covid. Half parents think whole thing hoax, everyone facebook mommy groups agrees must true. think Bill Gates really bad guy microchiping everyone sticking 5g antenna everyones.... likely. Viral remnants thing weeks month later, 6 months recovery. know predominantly aimed US, thought y'all would like insight UK well. work one major grocery chains here, way treated company customers shocking. 

We given special one bonus year effectively doubles could earn. every time government reduced things like social distancing gap, increased number people allowed stores etc. company responded immediately implementing this.

For context, social distancing measure changed keeping 2m apart least 1m possible. markings floor help people maintain distance dropped 1m night store closed new policy implemented.

Our store gone around 30 customers time (effectively 3 per aisle) limit 94, recently doubled. Effectively, people store ever actually have.

The company work unionised. union representative, contacted ""manager"" (of sorts) within union questioned happening agreed. Yes, had. also told appreciate questioning way union carries business. little support there.

Customers worse they've ever been. Whilst first supportive etc. they've liberties restored, longer give fuck. actively lean staff working grab something shelf, refuse even try social distance one another (not company helped letting many in), they've become abusive things go way.

This involved threats towards staff physical violence, verbal abuse, small town work in, huge thread community Facebook page we, staff, rude customers asking maintain social distancing possible.

My colleagues called Nazis, we've sworn at, personally abused (I called fat bastard customer week. entirely untrue, welcome) . trying best job keep people safe.

This dehumanising unique US. cannot speak rest Europe UK we're bit unique beast culturally, shit great height. Unfortunately, expect new norm.

The fact face consequences every single day, come groceries, get coffee Starbucks, whatever, perceive risk. None key workers exist bubble think half hour they're ""the thing"". worry 10 hours day. Probably people.

Combine fact lot people see work ""menial"" jobs inherently them, melting point shittiness. 

Anyway, much love fellow retail workers. fucking heroes me. shit put ridiculous. entitlement people unlikely get better, know somewhere, fat bastard UK nothing respect shit putting with. No, proven antibodies generated sub-type work sub-type regardless spike mutation, research weeks ago. Well, there's ""upside"" this, least could easily find good candy corn now. Remember hazard pay getting companies? like decided risk anymore case count got bigger nationwide. Really reflects culture type people are, really sad work front-end supervisor/cashier/florist local grocery store outside Toronto. $2 increase pay gone last week May.

This week alone I've called Nazi communist, told check white privilege, told doctors lied cause family member's death covid actually exist asked actually knew anyone disease. 

Shifts spent extra cleaning like wiping belt PIN pad customer, asking people back up, wear mask correctly instead nose chin. There's by-law made wearing masks inside stores mandatory. bunch us barely make minimum wage enforce bylaw.
Definitely pay grade, run risk catching forced take 2 weeks unpaid leave. Fun times. Nothing wrong religion....it's man....carry sheep's ü§™üòÇ That's cool none information going help get job. free online course knowing one language, maybe might? learning bunch stuff own, cool, set job. Jobs want proof know something. me, I'm community college, working got laid due covid concerns jobsite. know I'm able find work that's flexible enough still go school, let alone find work all. kill somebody. grew Paulding Co. They'll gone church weekend. MeeMaw Pawpaw's house. Someone asymptomatic. elderly Paulding going hospitals soon enough. 

I can't tell surreal see teacher old high school, Mr. Otott, mentioned NY Times photo went viral (no pun intended). superintendent allowing clusterfuck happen. cant put excess deaths covid. whole health system fucked, partly overworked also partly delayed treatment diseases. countries seen shocking reduction cancer diagnosis, cancer actually reduced. Yep Mcdonalds employee confirm entirely correct please respond nice day ""you too"" guarantee mutter leave definitely not. say thank you, take food go. Also I'm employee line retail says can't get something like milkshake, ask why. frankly fucking idea easier find alternative fuck off. Yeah, they've also lot domestic issues recently mass pig culling recent floods helped crops.

Also point, amount food wasted people ordering far many dishes pretty sad. Fear-boner strong sub. master debater anything, possibly underestimate. study done six weeks ago, posted comment thread (and immediately donwvoted reason) said 4.5 million infected England (not Britain whole) June.

Previous studies also suggested 20% infection rate London, whereas one found 13% Londoners it.

There's theory antibody levels might decline months, could mean people virus March starting test negative. might explain London's antibody levels dropped dramatically: outbreak earlier rest country's. DeAtHs?!? seems like Onion article America way I'd tested unless I'm hospitalized. encourages people lie protect becoming pariah.

this attitude majority kiwis share though. sure bunch nutters overall attitude spirit teamwork. government careful wording use Covid 19 campaigns - team 5 million, kind, protect other, etc. L3 lockdown imposed yesterday essential worker, usual 25 minute drive work 10 minutes today people listening staying home. people lauding new cases going getting tested, ostracizing them. they're met empathy support, anger. right America's problem terrible time position stupid fuck ordinances passed down.

7.8 billion humans

6.3 million active Coronavirus cases world

Only 60,000 severe critical.

That‚Äôs less 1%.

But REEEE PANIC AHHHH SCREEEEEEECH!!!!! mean American people. wasn‚Äôt political leader got racist towards Muslims 9/11 lot normal people. isn‚Äôt political leaders support draconian justice system traps people cycle jail rest life get first time. isn‚Äôt political leaders made anti-mask political statement. 


Blaming political leaders feel good thing say, everyone say ‚ÄúX terrible president/senator/governor‚Äù ugly truth general politicians mirror public far closely comfortable with. understand US basic slightly uncomfortable hygiene measure considered political stance brings unreasonable reactions. really can't explain shit Really essential workers need paid more. hoping pandemic would help people realize nothing‚Äôs changed. fucking quality mate üòÇüòÇüòÇ Hospitalisation data shows human impact. Case numbers numbers. test cases fall. can't hide hospitalisations, control hospital data, get twist numbers. appears blatant... Facebook mommy groups come life stopped going work Walmart last two weeks working 12-16 hour days also coming home baby couldnt fall asleep got home running shifts like 3 hours rest good day. supervisor threatened put hotel ""keep focused what's important, job"".

Let's say I'm done working good. Well needs doctors, diagnose? One thing sure, cost wise, Sweden clear winner.  China entire ethnicity way corona. comparison here. I've heard lot health professionals wear ppe first get sick. pro mask. unnerving public less susceptible lot willing take chance. catch positive result missed 10 more. Bumping stock prices again...

Just report treatment. person small boarding school tho September. strict guidelines place made lot sense me. seemed like possibility student getting sick. Yesterday school delayed October. understand though. It‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs safety. we‚Äôre isolated school doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs gonna idiot student lies breaks rules gets infected. cases outside mean greater chance cases inside. worries though kids going public school days week. can‚Äôt manage everyone following guidelines. bunch kids start getting it, real shit gonna hit fan. body already infected similar coronavirus past, immune system may recognize SARS-COV-2 provide protection form cells kill virus without antibodies needed. Social media worst. husband keeps telling close it‚Äôs like much else do! family least gets it, however annoyed might be.  2 year old everyone wants get near it‚Äôs going happen.

You stay awesome too! Thank I‚Äôm Canadian. Jealous Kiwis though. studies shown level protective antibodies infected person may build fight virus quickly drop months, possibly making susceptible pathogen second time. **However, little evidence far re-infection occurring pandemic.**

It's new play anything down. Assume worst pandemic.   YES. OPEN SHUT. Get fuck Maybe masks would good idea? Reminder. big holiday week Japan. much less testing much less tests processed. Bill Gates plan depopulate Africa....and?ü§î study linked, infected people household removed quarantine facility. remaining family tested Twice ensure infected.

Then tracked see become infected later, Covid positive patients moved quarantine.

So study linked supports moving Covid patients quarantine.

If anything study testing HOME safe patients removed, cases proves be. Yep. 2-3 weeks. Incubation period + symptoms getting bad enough people actually test + time takes get test results back. looking correlation data look 2-3 weeks back. Mask mandates showing effective areas see declining numbers. schools opening see another weeks effect well. work pharmacy.

There‚Äôs lot stuff dental office isn‚Äôt cleaned patients-doors building, reception/waiting room areas. one people working patients wearing masks back then. I‚Äôd feel lot safer though since there‚Äôs lot precautions place. wearing masks. group 11 wanted seated one table. Restrictions limited taples six people. Totally, we've terrorized. lost bunch freedoms.  Can't wear shoes airplanes bring water bottles.  terrorists won. Call bluff. can't possibly put every concerned parent jail. took stocking shelves part time night thinking would chill job side. anything but. Like bang 5 aisles yourself. God bad idea. Surgical mask vented N95. 30 years old good shape I'm particularly worried reports lasting damage hearts even asymptomatic cases. I'm worried might able physically things love still young man. Fuck we're fucked everyone fucked fucking fuck. We're DEAD OMFG. Indien ist gefickt! ""All facebook groups tell experts know anything."" study method testing, actual masks.

You need study masks make determination.

Lysenkoism? ""Boregouis psuedoscience""? Sluggish schizophrenia? seasonal summer pneumonia. laws never passed eventually going used people.  Fear get people sign away rights quickly. I'm interested see repeatedly infected handle virus next time. bad? flu level? essentially harmless? Somewhere between?

It would good news hear people handle better second time around. Welcome clickbait. I'm sure could spent month going around Netherlands find similar stories. publication wants story, they'll find it. like however, proper representation Christians way.

I'm grocery worker, avoided first month true nightmares March due school, I'm bit skewed.

 


I think I've lucky far things go, extra $2 pay ending got perma-bumped .50/hour, cases front end store. also got plastic dividers pretty fast get many crazies (except one dude LICKED CART saying hoax). One issues giving enough hours everyone staff restrictions, making work harder well though. I'd say mixed bag, slightly positive, least me.

But also thought rude asshole wanted look around stores without say hello goodbye everyone every time, so....

It really weird know workers forced say things customers. can‚Äôt bring say fake ‚ÄúFine, thanks, you?‚Äù back, dead-eyed stare, pause, obvious ‚ÄúFine, thanks‚Äù lie quietly devastating. end kinda ignoring required question smile say ‚ÄúHi!‚Äù somehow feels less awkward. feel like put thought guess did.

Excellent comment. well thought out.  Tons insight study. Thanks! laws heavily supported neoliberal Dems Biden likes brag practically wrote Patriot Act. Neoliberal Dems Republicans keep trying expand bills reach, including monitoring browser history without warrant.

For real healing, Republicans neoliberal Dems need lose power. thought one joke, made laugh sub sure is. It‚Äôs one impressive echo chamber. link tests claim done?

The problem advertisements make lot claims. routinely see snake oil products sale claim stuff tested proven. hair loss treatment. weight loss pill. erectile dysfunction magic bullet.

I clicked Guardian article repeat claim. link study.

I'm saying says does. I'm saying I'd see data, preferably published peer reviewed journal I'd trust it. Good thing pay taxes, let's us pool resources lifetime circumstances like this. Good thing also elect people govern use money us. dental assistant significant influence working clinic especially safety, disinfection sterilization aspects. Ask read upon try implement whatever possible present circumstances. Surgical masks dropped price lot. cost around 30 eurocents study masks. demonstrating experimental setup procedure test masks.

The picture masks tested actual paper even include valved n95 mask, knows tested n=1 study one type mystery valved mask. guarantee half face respirator much larger less restrictive exhalation valve.

Additionally, counted macroscopic droplets illuminated laser could seen vision system. Nothing aerosolized emissions.

Be careful believing people say studies instead reading self. according come contact potentially infectious surfaces often also close contact infectious person, making distinction respiratory droplet fomite transmission difficult discern. However, fomite transmission considered likely mode transmission SARS-CoV-2, given consistent findings environmental contamination vicinity infected cases fact coronaviruses respiratory viruses transmit transmission may also occur indirectly touching surfaces immediate environment objects contaminated virus infected person (e.g. stethoscope thermometer), followed touching mouth, nose, eyes.** 

There direct reports someone contracting COVID objects surfaces difficult say. However, safest bet would yes. 

Carry hand sanitizer can't wash hands especially need go public. post wasn‚Äôt whether lockdown effectiveness lockdowns. people saying start pandemic death models wrong way would many deaths predicted. people ended wrong course won‚Äôt find admitting new system, first order contacts also quarantined precaution not? (I.e. people living Household?) Also, family members get tested positive days between, moved together quarantined separately? Suck fuck  Hard say, antibody studies.

There prison ""1,248 people tested, Gautz said 1,148 Air circulation air-conditioning restaurants tosses covid fuck around. *"" Nelson says evicted thousands dollars medical debt never knew existed. says belonged mother-in-law technically still owns property passed away years ago left number things worked probate court. ""*

Sounds like house foreclosed on. eviction ""evil landlord"". okay $71k starting 6 months $110k study sample size neck fleece *one person*. great write flawed methodology study. He's really dead. lives couple states away talk much anymore.

I guess mom kind of... held family together. Man, people really screwed up. Winter going suck really final nail economic coffin. Could rebirth nation, instead we'll locked holidays. schools reopen masks distancing all? reopened normal? Likely likely? Helpful hot take. think lot people actually trying kill kids without incurring criminal moral liability, realized they're stuck taking care life. mean, cures they'll happy, secretly know poison that's point. Oh yeah... it‚Äôs creeping alright... 10,000 miles away someone actually believes virus takes seriously.

This headline mis-leading. 

Cases going people get virus, die. Personally, think age ranges people grouped in, article, misleading. range 25-44 wide there‚Äôs quite difference lifestyle 25-44 they‚Äôve classifying young. 

Also, get tired narrative around race virus media politicians. virus picking hispanics black people. social economic factors responsible this. Minorities tend hold jobs can‚Äôt done remotely thus increasing chance getting virus. Also, income gap, they‚Äôre likely access good health care good food correct nutrition would lead underlying causes. would lead cases deaths anyone acknowledges America‚Äôs racial divide could‚Äôve seen coming. I‚Äôm support racial inequality, needs fixed, also needs pointed out. 

This virus isn‚Äôt selecting minorities. 50 people shot weekend, eh? Where'd get stat, hemorrhoid filled fat ass? Testing fallen states, including Florida, North Carolina Tennessee, home country‚Äôs largest Covid-19 outbreaks. national drop testing driven largely Southern states, group said.

yeah, common states? potus Robot governors? Maybe, still mean herd immunity even close. dare ask government take care things government take care Didn‚Äôt see coming. seriously suggesting farts don‚Äôt contain particulate matter?

Come on, we‚Äôve one time ate leftovers little old... :P Yo stonks go up. Get back school parents get back work. Because, screw South. That‚Äôs less rallying cry sub days. cost tens, maybe hundreds thousands deaths? think so, bud. Six months year without classroom kill kids. Sending classroom kill teachers at-risk students.

Remember said teacher shortage? going replace dead teachers? dead students really worth risk socializing kids months? I'm fucking infuriated. I'm living high-rise building taking maximum precaution. pay fortune grocery delivery, leave unit anything mail packages lobby. 2 unlikely anyone roaming halls common areas. sanitize groceries anything else comes unit. leave P100 respirator, goggles, face shield hat. sanitize everything coming back in, even opening unit door.

However, people building absolute monsters comply **mandatory** mask policy. Guess what, even employees comply. receptionist gives packages takes mask off.

Despite taking precautions, making **all fucking sacrifices** (trust fun), got sick month ago nagging, persistent cough go away. I'm getting tested COVID tomorrow. doctor believes there's good chance COVID.

Words cannot express disappointed disgusted people violated way. Shame them. Hopefully universe make pay damage they're doing.  one knows threshold know Don‚Äôt give wants.  behind screen. people ordered take masks not. Apparently requests able hear people clearly (which understand masks make tough hear people). Real issue person court cases.

&amp;#x200B;

Some key quotes wearing mask, actively ordering counsel remove masks litigating,‚Äù Tauber wrote behalf public defenders prosecutors District Attorney‚Äôs Office.  letter Murphy, Tauber noted Lynn‚Äôs avoidance masks runs ‚Äúcontrary‚Äù July 1 order state Department Health requires face coverings ‚Äúin indoor location members public generally permitted,‚Äù step First Judicial District‚Äôs safety requirements. sign indicating masks required posted door leading Lynn‚Äôs courtroom, Tauber wrote.  courtrooms already equipped safety plastic glass, including plastic box recently constructed around bench Lynn‚Äôs courtroom, 5F, Give in, No. Effin mouthbreather you‚Äôre arguing favor American country case, right? ‚ÄúAmerica got wrong‚Äù anything? oddly enough, ICUs full death rate spikes natural causes Fair, tested positive means wife probably incubating potentially asymptomatic. Id self isolate, monitor symptoms get tested weekend next week. Although almost 7 days since potential exposure people develop symptoms 2 - 5 days long 14 days. mean lockdowns work? Quick, someone tell president governors! dentist Texas full hazmat suit, face mask everything.

Which like....yea course, college degree biology.... Ok freaking several lessons New Zealand‚Äôs pandemic response. Rapid, science-based risk assessment linked early, decisive government action critical. Implementing interventions various levels (border-control measures, community-transmission control measures, case-based control measures) effective. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern provided empathic leadership effectively communicated key messages public ‚Äî framing combating pandemic work unified ‚Äúteam 5 million‚Äù ‚Äî resulted high public confidence adherence suite relatively burdensome pandemic-control measures. Future lessons New Zealand include need stronger public health agencies better assess manage potential threats greater support international health organizations, notably World Health Organization.

[Like little 3-layer surgical basically even feel like wearing anything. insane selfish people can't survive 96% comfortable. least young people hope.

That's said Millennials; there's hope found generation. Sorry feel way. I've hunkering pretty hard.. go store usually try speak much quick possible limit exposure. also try order delivery (groceries meals) much possible.

I think people appreciate you, weird cloudy bubble lately. ignorant ones outspoken ever.

As far 14 year old mugging someone, (don‚Äôt know black kid lol) non violent ways rob people resort that. said mugging someone didn‚Äôt mean pushing someone ground stealing purse. imagining someone getting shit beat them, happened friend mine. God wish wife‚Äôs school would this!!!!! really meant recent years. entirely sure reason behind downvotes versus actually giving answer like did. honestly forgot rovers. Thanks reminder response!
It's hard keep accomplishments perspective. Well considering New Zealand looking thing cause latest outbreak, think write possibility straight away. opening act Elton John... night early 80's glorious ska. country band called Soda Stereo, whose first album one best Rock-Ska fusions I've ever heard. Probably would except religion. Fire manager told this. love kids! don‚Äôt want own. I‚Äôd amazing father, don‚Äôt feel like life incomplete without kids. So...fuck kids. Yeah believe somehow morphed grotesque message liberals forcing conservatives position submission requested wear one. It‚Äôs real pity precautionary step helps everyone turned symbol trigger hostility rather unity community Username checks Former retail employee four years here. almost zero disrespectful customers age 30. pain ass customers older white men middle aged women.

Now seems like bargain. lol think boy wants developmentally disabled point incapable wearing mask? 

This issue wants. Even believe despite disability shouldn‚Äôt allowed plane, doesn‚Äôt mean can‚Äôt empathize family.

Airborne virus distancing, source control, PPE immunity.

Of course happened. Well, probably 5th grade science education, really someplace mind would ever go. see. Thanks quick reply! There‚Äôs reason say never talk religion politics, casual conversation. Yeah liability waivers make people think can‚Äôt sue. always sue negligence. don‚Äôt support Trump.  Things r/Coronavirus doesn‚Äôt want hear 1,000 Alex Missing cleaning going ruin mouth. hysterical idiot. Can't fix stupid. smell fear.

But yeah unless dishes want see work forearms. üòÇ worked service industry teens early twenties (80s-90s), people always way, physical. I've berated menu prices, waitstaff set prices. I've deal angry customers food cooked (as chef) seated (as hostess) quality drinks (as bartender).

I've also criticized music restaurant, either selection, volume, both, servers control it. Believe me, WISH. 

Now whatever reason, people feel like violence minimum-wage workers answer. goes show bullies always pick people position fight back. say find fuckers sue them. Give bright young lady free college education! start Sweden denied trying achieve herd immunity, imo worried would explode control figures seemed favourable see resistance idea goal.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* something wish could pound skull refuse care one another. odds dying covid relative short-term fantastic, odds suffering long-term horrifying.

Covid toddler set loose china shop, wielding hammer, loves sound broken glass. think ‚Äú working vaccine‚Äù time scale good you‚Äôre counting things going back way exactly 2020, massive crowds not, everything goes according plan vaccines think lot things open around March ( vaccine potential boosters administered vulnerable population) Can't go outside nature? Sitting home, nothing probably worst do. 
Taking walk forest, alone (or close friends) probably make feel better. Getting sun skin also help immunity. Lmfao. Americans different definition heavy lockdown Asian countries guess.

""Strictly leaving house except for: groceries; essential workers like doctors, nurses, utility company workers, restaurant owners, waiters, patrons diners, hairdressers customers, mall workers customers etc.; outdoor activities (I remember people Reddit complaining march april people parks hiking trails whole themselves); protests counter protests; whole list random exceptions""

Yeeeaaahh, ""lockdown"" Definitely. spreads person person via air. Fomites secondary transmission factor afaik widely believed much less common infection via aerosols (big small).

I still disinfect grocery packaging wash hands, also wear mask near people contacts me. easy measures keep safe reduce spread. Theres whole wave calm although lot people responsible understandably pissed theres always possibility protest, also looks like government aware days hitting world news changing recommended precautions level 

The last part purely speculation kinda looked hopefully everyone alright

My personal annoyance 25% loss internet bandwidth due usage day around country devices pulling personally find lockdown relaxing takes stress get sleep day Rookie numbers. Sweden averaging around 100 deaths/day while. would equal 3000 deaths / day US. understand 35% people lack intelligence/insight think harmful behaviour acceptable. believe proven con man... Haha, fuck little whiny crybaby Smashmouth. ü§ò fuck yeah Zombie! I've wondering exactly mean ""Difficulty breathing"" like place respiratory tract.. Nostrils, throat Lungs? 

Many time nostrils blocked (one both).. others may feel discomfort burning lungs.. They've reduced amounting testing quite significantly. much wished actually dropped hasn't. Well, higher admins (principal, vp, superintendent, councellors) states require additional levels accreditation education qualifying experience beyond classroom teaching. means extra years college and, fairness, deserves compensation proportion education expenses.

That said, years schooling justification huge salary gaps teaching admin. Admins earn high six figures teacher suffer poverty wages. God created energy empty void universe. God put there. know this? literally impossible energy started big bang appear nowhere. impossible universe, energy cannot created, transfered. come conclusion God created energy there, literally nothing else could've. Nothing else could made energy started big bang. they're using term hyperbolic. Sounds like Durst sucks Nickleback, I'm surprised even possible. ...is o-zone pun

Take upvote begone I‚Äôm honestly curious, US? haven‚Äôt heard incidents elsewhere, maybe aren‚Äôt recorded? 

But least back home live now, don‚Äôt think problem. Sure workers exploited that‚Äôs really bad, consumers mostly apathetic worst, seriously adding insult crappy conditions frontliners already in. better ignore possible situation chance pop happens?

It's really uncommon single parents support structure ignored making decisions like this. That's right, I'm quite sure incubation experiment happening speak. ran incubation experiment samples 300 asymptomatic carrier found Wuhan full population test every single one came back viable. likely similar result time too, although latent period quite crazy. Yes. Even among police officers seems like death ratio skewed toward blacks. would imagine majority would similar health insurance, similar line work, wealth etc. makes wonder maybe genetics actually matter virus. think fortunate supposedly given everything anything exceptional given everything go hardships. horrible way think life. Everyone stuff go through. say ambition deserve anything. weird think little yet think smart given everything. cannot victim beneficiary one sentence. think confused lot growing do. Yeah guys stop fat already üòÇ make treat like humans. new cases day everyone virus. told two friends ... Psych tech too... really aren‚Äôt paid enough do. leave bit got chemo unemployment I‚Äôm currently paid. üòÖ bet glad attend infectious prison considers ""serious artist"". Mouth

Bwahaahahahahahahaahaha agree point demographics wouldn‚Äôt IFR 0,76%? says 3260 inmates. So, I'm American. know, everything worst here, I've got pretty solid understanding government knowing they're doing. 

That said, I've cried twice watching PM Health Minister speak. I'm proud it, I've pretty starved competence transparency leadership sense community camaraderie. government appears exactly done (plus every Kiwi seems page, helps massively). knew another outbreak inevitable, they've put heaps plans place happened. Jacinda‚Äîwho wonderful, btw‚Äîwas open fact four initial cases one household, worked different locations, localized one suburb. way speaking, seemed like unfortunate, expected planned for, reality. 

Your worries understandable. outside perspective, though, seems great hands. Keep good work there. Dogs get (and die) COVID also. think stop ignoring fact need push harder better/faster testing. SLOW TESTING DOWN! bullshit. worry retail workers, never did. worked retail close eight years, never again. go warehouse pick shit put back 12 hours day, go home. boring shit longer deal rude entitled customers think know better/more do. miss completely feel anyone deal people, especially daily basis. mom janitor medicine factory got phone stolen grocery store. even wearing badge extremely upset already financially struggling. Please respect essential workers There's also bit thunder typhoon season past couple days.

I convinced weather conditions may also affected hospital visits extent. Actually know matter thst much. Australia coming winter think much impact. flu levels miniscule compared normally covid precautions stopping flu well covid. course heading spring ramping up. Wish us luck...  relative, fatality rate anyone 70 without severe risk factors 0.1%. Basically risk dying within next year doubles getting Corona. I'm sorry plants completely different branch life, plant viruses employ different mechanisms get replicate.
Also n n h u n e n e mean it‚Äôs kinda sad isn‚Äôt surprising someone cut massive corners say that

 ‚Äú we‚Äôre first ones develop COVID-19 vaccine complete vaccine shortest period time!‚Äù 

I really really really hope aren‚Äôt serious side effects vaccine ( stage 3 for) everyone gets alright big bang theory mention god, address started. Actually millennials made largest portion new infections.

Those pictures beaches, huge parties millennials conspiracies? daily dosage HCQ bleach chaser kept virus bay. I've also constructed wearable faraday cage keep 5G signal exploding virus.Sure heart rate 180 resting, vomit blood occasionally damn faraday cage really hard take shower in, covid. Rip  Coincidentally started feeling depressed beginning pandemic, even isolated myself. mom links somehow Corona given 2 options. Either school week get kicked house. guess I'm pretty much dead. 300+ students school kinda old teachers (40-60s)

Edit: Small small school too, 300ppl like walk others like time. cafeteria always full. We‚Äôre #1 everything!!! Suck it!!! wrote lengthy comment little chain, summary, companies 'require' degree putting go college playing field. requiring college education mostly applicable accrued industry experience point sort college degree (or lack of) would irrelevant compared done working real world. going avenue someone go college CS going able navigate right start career without genius built extraordinary app spare time. 

Honestly, entire assessment comment responded centered around conflating exceptions/outliers actual trends. average CS grad racking anywhere near 300k debt...if went median value, would probably right 30-50k range mentioned. Yeah, obviously paid 300k degree (my entire costs sans scholarships income campus jobs + internship even 300k 6 years, let alone 4), amount debt take absolutely worth compared hoops would jump tried without going college. Majority minimum wage earners 20 FYI. Many single mothers, color. think meant direct comparison ""essential workers literally slaves"" much saying ""essential"" mean well-treated respected - necessary maintain profits. There‚Äôs free travel among states. That‚Äôs difference one strain deadly less contagious

Ah... see. one.... contagious 

and still pretty deadly

oh. I've seen many ads sexy singles area. TIL lying legally refuse enter courtroom? say disability, condition. must nice  Plus lower number confirmed cases due artificially reducing testing (i.e. demand based testing) lead false confidence, lead people letting guard down, lead deaths. Ha ha ha ha mental breakdown quit job. People assholes. cashier sucks 10x ever did, I‚Äôm never going back. EVER. hell going Sweden? Seems outlier Europe. even makes UK look proactive transparent \[kind of, barely tbh\]. weird, everything I‚Äôve said true. problem I‚Äôve said? one strain deadly less contagious, contagious still pretty deadly Yes, China record lying know else good at? Telling people stay home wear mask. well transparency reporting (lol) freedum USA? like bees. I've worked 20ish weeks since lockdown began UK, comment think. vast majority people feel implicitly owed something, likely angered safety precautions delay ""essential"" barbecue minutes.  God hope troll whole comment. Jesus man weird also import tons soybeans Brazil ...  Big bang theory: energy cosmos condensed singular point, energy released 15 billion years later so, universe me.

The thing fundamental law energy cannot created, transfered. energy come from? certainly come anything energy cannot created, defies laws physics.

So yes, know evidence support big bang theory, entirety cosmos drifting away singular point universe. universe ever expanding, never shrinking. things know sure. creation universe could come nothing, simply impossible. I'm sure maskless, 5G fearing, freedum loving, HCQ swilling legions immediately start following simple public health guidelines like wearing mask, avoiding crowds, washing hands save us all. Oh wait can't follow 3 rules 6 year old could learn, idiots doom chance fall catastrophe. North American/ Western European vaccines would coming public relatively short time frame compared Russian vaccine.

One difficulties notion race little genetics.            
For example latino/hispanic explicitely race according US census. white latino, black latino, asian latino american indian latino.    
Races heavily influenced culture (the one-drop rule example, Obama considered black although mother white). 

I agree core saying. diversity medical study useful.

LOLOL government charge something virtually guarantees shortage. Maybe herd immunity threshold lower think Sweden, least past months. reasons might responsible (I came others reading comments sub):

1. It‚Äôs summer country comfortable summer weather, encourage people gather outdoors.

2. recently holiday break schools closed.

Hopefully two aren‚Äôt important factors, cases rise coming months. possibilities:

3. far I‚Äôm aware one holding events tens thousands people Sweden, even hundreds often.

4. smaller, mostly spread (obviously exceptions like Stockholm) population

5. Higher equality lot countries places like US Latin America inequalities blamed spread vulnerable communities

6. Higher rates people living alone countries

7. Sweden working building good contact tracing program recent months

8. people choosing stay home, wear mask, keep distance others, avoid public transportation, etc.

9. Greater access testing gets people test positive isolated.

10. People would less likely go public sick pandemic even haven‚Äôt tested. would either respect others look sick. Dad condition related acid reflux causes cough time hates going public people look I‚Äôm sure Swede dry cough (a common symptom) would worry would perceived way.

Some factors aren‚Äôt unique Sweden right I‚Äôm becoming skeptical we‚Äôll see many places reach 50% immunity. even 20%.

""....the number individuals showing tests dropped 40%, reflects trends nationwide.""

so either:

1) they're lying turning away people

2) less people getting sick

3) they're moving testing sites uber rural areas far away metro areas

4) people may getting sick, want get tested 

5) people whose jobs mandated testing past longer are, people lost jobs

I‚Äôm happy it, think it‚Äôs hilarious American saying didn‚Äôt come Canada previously said reasons, meanwhile America worst offender that. Americans love play victim literally bully every country around globe data road draw proper conclusions.

Won‚Äôt ever happen. Living information age doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs better data. means data easier falsify manipulate. could anyone right mind believe statistics China, US Russia?  That‚Äôs really good idea, I‚Äôve always happier I‚Äôm volunteering something charitable always makes faith humanity see others working good too. I‚Äôve focused work mentally surviving social isolation since started, volunteering time corona hasn‚Äôt even occurred possible. I‚Äôm sure opportunities. Thanks idea! :) strongest evidence effective masks are. Honestly, looked myself, following Hold2LLC Twitter he's deep dive things AZ. pointed discrepancy day feed, said separated numbers available state's site. know would combine PCR antibody give true percent positive current infections. odd. divide 200,000 330,000,000 get percentage death population. It‚Äôs around 0.0006. divide 1/2000 get 0.0005 school online option, kid go school. Period. Trust scientists, doctors, experts? Children might drink paint thinner that's reason pull market. Ok Yeah antibiotics HUGE.

So many people would dying secondary bacterial infections them. happened purrell ? found Right. Shut collecting unemployment we're making working. That's we're mad depressed. Everybody else getting expensive paid holiday we're stuck working pandemic. come 0.7% treatments

Do data that? numbers seem confirm went much. got prescription went last year honestly even need glasses 99% time. prescription sunglasses wear drive they're completely fine. way infection rates topped inexplicably low numbers Diamond Princess, US naval vessels, Stockholm places.

In addition reactivity human immune cells pre-COVID years COVID proteins.

What's children dramatically underrepresented COVID infection metrics also suggests kind preexisting existing among them. going recycling effect happen even schools completely shut down. real issue either forseen unforseen administration parents everywhere. joke died 10 years ago never funny begin with. Lol, you, people upvoted you, realize assuming people reading comment know already?

What point stating something obvious?

Are pulling kind KenM type deal? Maybe satire got whooshed? ""Clear convincing evidence"" much higher bar standard employment disputes, ""preponderance evidence."" 6 hours day, lol. read British conservative media (The Spectator Telegraph spring mind) see intellectual luminaries Toby Young basically implying people lay lives economy. probably defensible philosophical argument utilitarianism work real world.

Johnson got lot heat ""I level you, lot going lose loved ones"" line. Backbenchers furious. Kinda schadenfreude sort way. need stop saying things like ""It's flu"" ""It is."" still many questions we're dealing with, making absolute claims like ""open schools"" ""open football"" dangerously insane. giving people false sense security, shaming others capitulation. supposed make us feel better now? Yes is, go old model. 100% dropping system implemented. even beneficial people around also mask wearer, unlike newspapers ""reported"" April/May.  study checked virus fragments, whether virus viable. So, even sprayed surfaces wiped them, study would still say ""we found COVID surface"". quarantine effective, even 3 months quarantine, study would still say ""we found COVID surface""

aka, study useless.

Keep thing keep safe, pointing limitations stupid studies like these.

Edit correctness know saline injection vaccine know father got vaccine placebo.

Is problematic study obvious? 

I guess type thing like psychiatric drug believe there's effect there's not.  either virus don't. But, wonder knowledge received impacts behavior? I'm even sure inconvenience much told do. Seeing grown adults throwing literal tantrums told need something. Sorry, resist =) guess could try going back pre-agriculture maybe try feudalism again. could go state communism, least disastrous implementations failed push citizens middle income capitalist equivalents reached high-income (East vs West Germany North vs South Korea). Exactly, WTF? mechanism wealthy landowners desperately need tourism prop standard living could contribute closing budgetary shortfall.

What would mechanism called? Yup, looks good healthy, lets send get infected bring home everyone else. FUCK CDC!!! School. Valid points. depends governments getting shit together people actually part happen. Unless Vietnam, Taiwan NZ. 

The state world embarrassing, quite frankly. take good hard look world general done fix problems never ever happens again. definitely agree social media. I've limited Twitter/Facebook quite bit legit stresses much release anymore. I'll give daily news blast read, like seeing competing perspectives things tend try bring middle anyway.

Thank you! dont know know swedens deaths per capita higher USA. really place would want emulate. addition, swedes seem take care social distance themselves. social inerations measured 30% normal. didnt lock doesnt mean didnt respond crisis. Also, gatherings 50 people still banned. Also, nordic countries like denmark, switzerland finland netherlands lower infection death rates. think making case lockdowns save lives. Thanks.

Glad safe! dont sure bucko look numbers independently. CDC excess death estimates raw numbers based expected deaths (yearly averages, etc) vs actual deaths. difference ""excess death"" estimate lower upper bound. time bomb constantly goes off. Even normal circumstances people lots health problems cost lot money healthcare system. really funny, dude. Sigh. guess entire state Kentucky gym? Thank insight. Kentucky continue trend worse colleges test students recently moved back campus. Context important, studentsdoc Again, I'm 'assuming' it. made definitive comments say T-cells reason. 

All said general consensus plays part, appears though areas reached ~20% seroprevalence longer rise infections, epi-curves show areas, outbreak coming end. means something else, antibody immunity, playing part.

As consistent across world areas severe early outbreak, scientists looking reason. Several studies brought pieces puzzle show T-cells may playing part this.

As i've reiterated again, assumed. theory tested. phenomenon consistent, currently T-cell immunity best theory explain it. I'm saying definitive terms certainly case. based limited information have, appears though may play part.

""Antigen specific cells much harder study antibodies it‚Äôs definitely possible

Basically start vaccinating and/or challenging model organism collect lymphocytes analysis. animal models, usually done euthanizing animal collecting spleen and/or draining lymph nodes contain high numbers cells. Obviously isn‚Äôt possible humans, human models compromise instead collecting circulating cells blood. Much lower yields you‚Äôre less likely find antigen-specific cells gotta work got. Next choose stimulate cells antigen(s) think specific to. stimulation cause antigen specific cells rapidly proliferate, making easier study them. two major readouts cytokine-production (look Th1 cytokines like IFNy cell culture and/or within cell via staining) tetramer staining. simplicity‚Äôs sake, tetramers thought custom made molecules stain antigen-specific cells.

General protocol name - cell recall assay

Methods used measures serum cytokines - ELISA, cytokine bead array, luminex bead array

Methods used look cytokine-producing cells - ELIspot intracellular cytokine stain typically read via flow cytometry

Methods used directly study antigen specific cells - tetramer staining typically read via flow cytometry

it's much harder study T-cells research taking longer, however found stimulate coronavirus T-cells SARS-CoV-2 meaning theoretically natural immunity. according Governor DeathSentence they're dead like Osama Bin Laden dead, America proud hard work, resilience ingenuity took get many deaths. took kill Bin Laden. Still happily wiping groceries since March.

Not pointing calling out, using example.

The test study tests \*fragments\* virus. idea whether viable, alive dead. general, every time they've tried culture virus form surface detected on, they've failed, unless big mucous blob.

So, feel important note even wiping groceries would likely test positive study COVID-19 wipe down. said, wipe definitely kill it, continue it.

TLDR: studies finding virus surfaces basically tell us jack shit fear monger. They're worse even study, IMHO. 225 yesterday, 322 July 30th. BC cases rise 85 one day. one's cares economic whatever. virus spreading Every school plan damn thing. Fomites, fomites, fomites.

Read:. **ELECTION CYCLE** Oh dont doubt something come along, long takes. pandemic still looks accelerating we've got winter joys brings coming up. Ok lets stop testing BS....wear mask live lives. feel sick see doctor get test, meanwhile wait vaccine......

I dunno wtf country might well gonna cut back testing, fuck number **deaths** estimated least 50 million worldwide 675,000 occurring **United States**.  according excess mortality around 200k US. Hence COVID needs kill 3,3 fold many people par Spanish flu.

I think possible outcome. Please source claims. florida really exist ? still know exactly COVID-19 brain. figured. They‚Äôve saying 150,000 while, also reporting 1,000 2,000 daily deaths. administration suppress truth want, people see bodies piling up. ones aren‚Äôt part Trump cult least. came numbers imposing cut 28 days, way reporting done Scotland, Wales NI know 1889 Russian flu positively impacted people Spanish Flu like that. Thank information. That's interesting.  key thing longer contagious get back work/routine. like might residual flu symptoms get it, stay home another week+ can't taste things.

You road getting better, worse. That's recovery. long-term toll signals billions healthcare costs ahead

There also mental health problems. China already facing mental health crisis corona. People lost friends family members, traumatized ill depressed stress quarantine, losing job, possibly even increased rates domestic abuse. stopping DeSantis case grants hospitals contingent getting back nursing homes soon possible. bad idea March April, sure hell face criticism August letting go states. actually case everywhere...

Some parts nation cautious others. instance, Philadelphia decided hold Armistice Day parade fill city tens thousands onlookers, led massive spike Flu cases deaths days/ weeks later, whereas St. Louis cautious cancelled festivities saw much subdued uptick cases/ deaths.

&amp;#x200B;

There also people adamantly public health mandates like masks, curfews, shut downs formed institutions like anti-mask society several cities throughout nation. 

&amp;#x200B;

We also know whether second wave back caused social factors, virus mutating deadlier novel strain able get around immune systems. Almost half American deaths incurred WWII. less one year ! 


This also surpasses American deaths WWI. chance relay make mark history, least good one. simple step would assured next election him. honestly think malice, mental disorder, maybe bring age years always getting he's way. behaviour speech sign metal disorder. 

And make grim prediction: win Yeah till over.
Masks going common socks alive anyone know random study 100k participants? self selected? chosen marketing list FB?

One feature COVID outbreaks that's like wildfire highly specific certain locale population. may ravage entire neighborhood town density high proportion shift workers yet leave adjacent regions relatively unscathed. new claims, total unemployment still slowly going peak. However, businesses stop closing, plausible it'll balance 15% manufacturing at-risk. Rollout might actually quicker expected goes well. do. Antigenic drift well understood phenomenon epidemiology. Sorry fit narrative. 

Anyhoo, good luck! said anything blaming them? Take ownership behaviour spent many years customer service know exactly demanding is. got tested last Friday fluke (going work 'bubble format' Basketball camp) required test. tested positive (PCR, said highly unlikely false positive). felt anything, feel great. Still 10 days iso, bet MILLIONS walking around like me. wear mask social distancing since March. fact, Basketball camp gonna first time I've driven 20+ miles house. Basically nothing wrote correct.

 - final replication stage virus killing cell releasing viruses. Antibodies overreacting killing cells happens cases, that's generally reason get sick.
 - body able fight viruses (with exceptions, like HIV). Except specific anti-viral medicine, cold medicine nothing virus itself. treats symtoms make feel better.
It's still immune system kills clears virus. No, **DRINK HAND SANITIZER** ***that's*** poisonings happening.

If used hands fine even ""wrong"" chemical there. People usually items grocery trip dinner day, don‚Äôt personally wipe lot time eat something got grocery store soon getting home instructing doctors code death Covid even assume Covid might contributed death. dont even need positive test.

It seems important generate numbers public health reasons medically correct.

So certainly kinds cases. Someone managed bring Herman Cain back life, unthinkable. Deaths go up, deaths go down, can't explain that. Working EMS, we're similar different problem. People getting exposed getting tested symptoms per cdc guidelines. guess okay dont live three dudes 1/3 time. 

The reasoning, dont necessarily disagree everyone contact exposure went quarantine, we'd responders left. best idea fire season Southern California. might sarcastic, either prison, everyone stays together nobody external might infected gets in.... keep everyone separated anyone infected infect anyone else.

If believe third way, lying yourself... others.   Remember ‚Äúfilm hospital‚Äù call arms? Idiots much patentable brand new drug. Thanks letting know. wasn‚Äôt making things saying thought didn‚Äôt think stated properly. Right. That's whole ""sanitize hands touch stuff"" thing. Well unfortunately he's completely wrong compare sending children teachers school war zone. seems like pre covid weekly school shootings. here. live Alabama weeks cases, deaths, hospitalizations way steadily dropping. Everything seems like normal except people wearing masks staying apart...but come Reddit think state burning people dying streets. worries! use [Google want find more. Perhaps find article study interests more. also think many human bodies evolved add, hold, carry weight global pandemic/war/hardship. least that‚Äôs keep telling myself. probably correct gene die completely people actually getting red hair likely become rare time. Everything use computer use social media track information. don‚Äôt know everybody worried surveilled on. cares?

Not trying dick minimize feel, don‚Äôt know age people putting everything anything YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, folks still feel like need hide stuff. Maybe actually making effort control spread? U think communists would intentionally leak virus? hit Wuhan?

Wouldn't want start say DC first. school like daycare kids. many labs dumping week? don‚Äôt think anyone said deadliest overall? appreciate that, many people would try diagnose me, already get scared enough WebMD lol. hope good day. Probably EXACTLY thinking ‚Äúwhy freak out, 14 cases‚Äù got US predicament currently in. 
Taking EXTREMELY seriously even single case key victory.  America land *Insert adjective*

RIP response. Heck shut St Patrick's Day! take seriously. Covid allowed burn world population herd immunity reached, fatalities Spanish Flu.

Fortunately several vaccines way hospital treatments much better even back March April compared type medical care available 1918. HANG ON. SAYING LEAST QUARTER WORLD GO?! basically 10% country gotten COVID-19. Nuts think it. 100% this. country I‚Äôm from, early pandemic everyone tested positive put hospital infectious diseases (no matter severity one‚Äôs symptoms). hell would want go there? People avoided getting tested like death sentence, kept secret contacts/friends/family facilitated even faster spread virus It‚Äôs scary outbreaks impact could happen often think. weren‚Äôt world stopping events post-COVID world we‚Äôre going react differently. I‚Äôm shutdowns social distancing I‚Äôm genuinely afraid go every 10 years even less. hellish experience. H1N1 09 happened COVID, differently would react? There‚Äôd mass panic sweeping shut downs probably devastating damage economy way life. didn‚Äôt stuff things mostly fine.

I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm even writing like said I‚Äôm lock downs social distancing draw line one outbreak another? true bubble. Disney staff free come go. pain? Really. THANK NYTIMES. I've harping excess deaths showing truer death toll official numbers (especially since GOP actively sabotaging tracking). I've gotten ""very polite discussions"" Qtips late pointed excess deaths much better measure real death toll far. Facts hurt dont it? üòÇ Lithuanian government thinks stop avoiding question. China warn asymptomatic spread 25/01/2020 not?

Asymptomatic spread makes indeed possible virus could already widespread, nevertheless warning heeded every country could controlled outbreak much better.

It‚Äôs almost 4 weeks, pandemic yet. 

QED It‚Äôs going get LOT worse, Christmas America 2020 going dark hellish. shitty situation across board. We're starting fully person kid's private school WNY, tiny school (something like 15 kids kindergarten + first grade cohort; 75 kids pre-K 8th grade) we're sub-2% positive tests area (which includes Buffalo).

On one hand, hard two parents work kindergartner stuck home (it like age especially conducive remote learning 6 hours day; even 30 minutes matter), leading least one person functionally quit job make work. can't afford drop one income? single parents?

On hand, one wants teachers students get sick. like we're going end going full person rest year - can't see us extending person teaching past October anyway. NY AZ, Cuomo going let rates go up. We're going hit 9% positive test result rate end shutting things anyway.

So families single parents cannot afford stay home young kids school. teachers children put risk get sick die. Literally horrible.

If functioning social security net... country's fallback plan appears ""IDK die?"" that's unacceptable. acceptable not, we're deal with. There's means gets fixed January (and practically, February still requires certain things happen election). Even vaccine available January 1st going fix time soon. So, someone knowledgeable help here.

I've seen Oxford say want ready winter (and optimistic see likes Faucci tout too).

If ready January, long things would move towards relatively ""normal"" again. Would massive time period trying get many vaccinated possible? Would back international travel, concerts, etc summer?

I'm guessing fact everyone want pump quickly cause delays, ultra curious thought time frames would available. ""Deadliest day summer"" deadliest day all. many reasons deaths high including backlogs data dumps. good news longer exists There's evidence herd immunity happening COVID anywhere world right now. Even source contradicts claim. Thats probably case flu's hit cold wars. heard anything regarding economic shutdowns like 1918 one tho.

Been waking sweats almost daily. Consistent pain chest back, headache, yet fever. think coughing fits. 

Sorry, dont know I'm telling this, probably place it. Considering flu IFR .04% .1% extremely bad doesnt need to, looking deaths causes vs statistical average vs reported covid deaths. deaths average reported deaths. even reported covid deaths wrong, number unreported covid deaths likely much higher. third Americans said they‚Äôd get vaccinated coronavirus, even vaccine widely available low cost.

Still, sorry derail imagine joke good nature. 100% side believing virus deadly think is, little hesitant put full trust statistic ‚Äúmore deaths usual‚Äù. aware quota make every year. (Ok, bad spot joke)

However, sit consider extra deaths may 0 coronavirus, rather everything access medical care, yea... deaths become extension virus deaths. 

Regardless extra deaths direct result virus result less medical attention, facts add whole situation sad. Formulate hypothesis, make work plan, test, write results publish show implicit argument compelling. Let us know goes. Nah we're really good killing foreign people, that's though. Considering it‚Äôs idiotic think virus already present many countries point due travel - late completely alleviate global pandemic (again China acting 3 weeks earlier would‚Äôve greatly helped this). cases traced back far October. 

Also - many places (especially NZ seemed intent criticizing) actually done great job handling pandemic.

That said - acknowledge US (and certain countries) responses incredibly poor, best. Leadership US non-existent.

However, completely separate point fact China, harmful intent, lied knowledge least 3 weeks continued lie numbers entire course pandemic. Thank you. üò™ Literally point trying make. quick reminder article talks England, makes majority UK population, calculation far off.  think problem steroid usage. Taking testosterone helps build muscle, messes woman many ways COVID results inconclusive COVID demonstrated capacity cause kidney failure know coroner's report amounts conclusive evidence coronavirus blame death. Also, good news!? still dead! Condolences family.  Fauci: *YES*  study compares excess mortality peak periods 1918 2020, New York City cases. NYC ca. April 2020 saw worst excess mortality world ([source scroll Table 2 sort Excess Deaths, [source thumb peaks charts) know significant chunk due piss-poor way nursing homes handled. (This worldwide 'oopsie' exhibited many NE states well everyone's favorite dog flogging, Sweden. one's guilty it, whole world learned it.)

It's important keep mind study's focus ""jump"" factor exhibited timeboxed subset pandemic. scope include looking overall toll destruction.

We probably never able calculate IFR Spanish Flu. know 50,000,000 casualties [a reasonable would actually make *global death rate* 2.75%, i.e. IFR would 2.75% (250-425% deadlier COVID-19) *if if* 100% world infected. wasn't.

(My math fixes upper bound IFR 1.1%, outlier even things worst really seen since. bound assumes 0.65% current CDC estimate, although course that's always subject change.)

[Here's interesting makes case IFR 6% 8%. I'm sure I'm 100% sold (it's rough, albeit intentionally so), let's take lower bound range. IFR alone, Spanish Flu somewhere 250% 925% deadlier COVID-19.

No small part reason discrepancy age-stratified mortality risk. 1918 flu good killing young people. COVID-19 isn't. set facts negotiable.

The study fault neglecting facts. purpose compare ""spike"" factor short window NYC worst place world COVID-19 damage (a window remains almost exclusively unchallenged ever since, despite peaks coming going). good job that. headline, usual, that's hysterical.

So hate people ""don't take seriously enough"", maybe learn keep theatricality check, nothing pushes people denialist extremes like lied to. Earned treat people person, arbitrary, subjective sense accomplishment usefulness, i.e. job have.  He's folks. 800IQ take ""My fitness center killed anyone yet, must safe""

Buddy, opinion wrong fellow conspiratorial dipshits follow feelings towards conclusions get people killed.

Vegas bogus Whittier shittier. Funcie Muncie Covid deniers anti-maskers generally people wish things like 1950's, wish half population stayed home. Compare American states crazy high excess deaths top official Covid-19 death toll paints different picture.

A picture under-reporting COVID-19 picture increased suicides, illnesses diagnosed timely manner postponed checkups, things? perhaps combination? pay go movie theater now. I‚Äôm year 8 ok low numbers, thats good sign know, kindness virtue. agree saved lives. Thanks playing. Meanwhile, Kemp digs heels more. true - plus, desperate times = lot gangs, individual hackers need cash least desire more...! hear you. Lots people dont think anything happen kids pushing door Yes, White House good job writing publishing CDC website. fight craziness. Maybe due screaming, complaining whatever, head explode. Maybe move away, less 'dangers'.

But honestly, think neighbors forget anyway, go back *other* bad habits / annoying bs (like would stop anyway) Jared Kushner understood this. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* seriously doubt Russia's highly experimental vaccine available United States time soon.

The planes really least concern here, airports bigger issue (though think many airports around US require masks right now, definitely helps). 

If fly direct, even better - I'd find best option even bit pricier right now. Holy shit Stop testing dead dying 
 people covid never record virus killing anyone else. situation ridiculous Campania. Tourists need tested free whatever want. resident comes back form holiday quarantine 14 days test negative. beyond stupid lmao. known going include Ammon Bundy. utter moron. Unfortunately, lot people Idaho listen view authoritative figure standoff Oregon 2016. 100% confirmed

Yes, closer 0% Vitamin deficiency best evidence base explanation.

There zero causal link far. long case, simple correlation worthless. like gather lot correlation, make missing causation. entirely different things. Here's example:

Rain good corn field. rains, sky gets darker temporarily - correlation close 100%.

So clearly, amazing correlation, darken sky, say starting huge fires, good corn field.

Got it?

We need show vitamin levels actually **cause** change COVID-19 outcomes, opposed caused **something else**. done all, amount circumstantial hypothesizing replace - think otherwise, simply understand science works.

To clear: support serious, large scale study aimed investigating vitamin link. Either confirm strike down. personally wish people would stop looking ""paper"" mortality rate. goes testing goes up. It... effectively whatever want to. paper. 

There real death rate thing. actually bringing learn treating keep hospitals stocked, staffed getting overrun. great fronts deserve applause. really know actual death rate honestly, outside medical professionals, much it. Testing harder change it, raises awareness. 

* end dead people. ""z"" people die would likely otherwise died time. That's endgame. want ""z"" big. 
* get ""z"" dead people taking ""x"" number people get infected multiplying ""y"" actual death rate (*from simple perspective, high level, surely go this...*). 
* explained people cannot affect actual death rate. number people ""x"" comes virus spreading person person. We/anyone affect by... spreading it. social distancing honestly anything imagine might prevent spread virus germs person person. wait order Facebook post tell this. Think way spread germs. it. makes ""x"" smaller.
* see dead people number go (which are) either death rate changing (it's getting worse...) almost certainly number people ""x"" running away here.

So nothing (outside pesky authorities require you, course). would actually worst thing world. choose actively slow spread however see fit. FFS please actively FIGHT people chose actively slow spread. fighting death. That‚Äôs idiotic. opinion wrong fitness center instituted policies allowed us wish continue working successful? Gtfoh Plus people really communicate spaniah flue people talk english spanish he? sounds like criticizing GOP leadership poor handling outbreak...

Because better specific, (1) also true never test cremated dead. never know COVID casualties might better err side caution. 

And (2) public understand *proximate causation* enough make informed decision based excluding count. indirect deaths matter too. crisis. So, found several news sources speak long-term effects, quoting various studies.

Actually worse that.

The Confederate flag never really flag Confederacy. 

It's second Confederate naval jack call Confederate flag. actual flag (after abandoned ""make American flag worse"" first few) white flag little square version naval jack upper left corner.

Edit: Oh right, worse: flag completely dead. Nobody flew long time. relic history... civil rights era began, resurrected specifically symbol hate. see someone flying claims racist, tell truth flag. exists today purely symbol hate.

And yeah, winter months typically spike viral pneumonia deaths like flu. makes things worrisome might control still summer still relatively easy. Winter real clusterfuck people scared this. Maybe.

Not really, people struggle much pandemic works. average college community, likely look like this.

1. Early September: Schools open. First cases come campus elsewhere. large outbreak, virus time spread.

2. Mid-September: first cases turned dozen cases, first small wave spreads through. large outbreak yet though.

3. Late-September: Now, dozen cases spread hundreds people. finally start seeing exponential growth rear ugly head. deaths though (or limited) young people bad complications. also first time hear ""some reports COVID cases appearing campus"".

4. Early-October: thousands people infected bubble campus, they're starting escape community around campus. college likely close go remote point, damage done, escaped larger community. start dozen cases.

5. Mid-October: Hundreds new cases start showing community, see first deaths. communities went full quarantine, could probably contain it, not, things get really bad.

6. Late-October: Thousands new cases community, hundreds appearing per day. Deaths moving double-digits per day.

7. Early-November: full-blown outbreak. large community, mass infections (likely 1,000+ per day) deaths moving close triple-digits.

So that's long take see ramifications September contagion event schools opening. happened Memorial Day weekend Independence Day, infections really taking weeks actual events. flu 10x deadly. 1/10th populated

Not necessarily.

We'd also consider COVID deaths recorded something else. can't look one side unknown call day. test vaccine lol course Giesecke (too) big role strategy. He's mentor Tegnell (and another guy FHM - can't remember who. Wallenstein maybe?) made join FHM consultant. anything, emails reveal much Tegnell relied him. march 19th, (Tegnell) candidly ""Is way modelling spread comes halt?""    

There's also something fishy Giesecke pushed wife participate development [serological links. usher left back January. Thank fucking god. mom told someone gets killed motorcycle accident. scrape body road test Covid. tests positive, Boom!, covid death! üôÑ killing public. guy‚Äôs really trying best also navigating swamp. got Taco Bell.

Take leave it. Let‚Äôs hope continues like that. Right it‚Äôs mostly used identify origin certain virus sample. adults can't make decision case. #1 public health issue choice wearing mask distance endangering rest. say scared stay home, reason virus rampant. stayed home go back precovid normal faster, make room idiots roam wild protection keep spreading virus. #2 many people choice leaving job usa lose everything within weeks months. well put. Thank you. like make shit accept 'reality' feel control aren't, feel like actually understand don't. Inability cope reality. Explains lot mother's behavior. Thank that. I'm articulate cognitive troubles health problems, comments like help out, help process things, lot. half 45 participants got vaccine trial, really tested 22-23 people. sound bit low vaccine prob. pushed world? I'm guessing phase 3 would much bigger pool? Unfuckingbelieveable Yeah what‚Äôs couple hundred thousands deaths amiright went looking Declaration Independence stayed cellar it, shit control. Yeah I'll try claims points STRICTLY attempting sow discord distrust Covid-19 numbers. 

But dont tons people say reported Covid numbers wrong trusted? What? bad virus is, going kill significant percentage people refuse wear masks... still know enough long term affects, maybe see something like higher rates heart attack/stroke populations spread freely, years come... like 90% going drop dead next year. &lt;&lt;&lt;COLLEGE FOOTBALL schools closed, get prolonged covid. need develop sort herd immunity, children barely affected COVID, let's open schools. Hiding away homes physically, mentally unhealthy huge negative impacts children. Wtf? I've seen this, read Chinese plumbing allowed happen. read building codes US allow shared common piping.  Spanish flu 10x deadly. 

NYCs 1/10th populated fine anything wearing mask. Private businesses enforce mask mandate many don‚Äôt. ones enforce employees assaulted requirement, although that‚Äôs common. I‚Äôd say 99% people stores etc live wear masks, think it‚Äôs less rural, country areas. favourite comment ever.   following me. imply unless don‚Äôt understand figures speech take everything literally. I‚Äôm getting older life getting shorter day. I‚Äôm blocking stalking comments Trump wants it.  I've mentioned several times virus sub 1% fatality rate. facts? useless lmao Outdoor dining fine. like going walk fine. Fucking stop. People like people scared get exercise around neighborhoods. Covid first wave, modern healthcare, antibiotics, ventilators, entire city lockdown. Tools  100 years ago. Capitalism doesn‚Äôt get taxpayer bailouts subsidies. 

The USA crony capitalism. scary. work, people walk get extra napkins utensils without masks on. remind people every day theres exit entrance only. people still ‚Äúforget‚Äù masks want push hoax / antimask ideas. large griup people come hoard section dining room get dirty germs spit everywhere. i‚Äôm frightened every day see people without masks inside. hands soft &amp; tiny his, terrified woman's handshake would crush fingers ‚ÄúIf show competences‚Äù. You‚Äôre obviously even trying see something different point view. We‚Äôre done here. Hey CDC, don‚Äôt go back recommending kids go school instead many states charge hefty fines breaking contract. several thousands dollars. many teachers pay break contract? yes, hiring process school district includes standard question ever broke contract. always deal breaker, looked upon favorably, either. TIL Smash Mouth still playing concerts put commercial radio thanking look good Yeah also like bathroom people sharing disinfected every use. someone explain forced continue distancing mask wearing one comes bubble without hard quarantine? I‚Äôm genially curious, disease needs host spread isn‚Äôt one restrictions still? speak locally SC, honestly think lot delayed results. Unless people really sick, direct known contact someone positive, required test, what's point takes almost 2 weeks know? then. test much. Look manuals! /s gives hope lates poll, Biden 16 points,so, majority people ready get rid guy. Trump 16 points, would little hope. FYI: Flavor-aid drank Jonestown. agree want economy/schools open level spread need widely available rapid tests. Idk, history injecting humans creating superhumans.... Yeah girl college argue world might 6,000 years old ""carbon dating perfect."" Ok. know what, right, someone decent office, maybe stuff could change. Trump pushes hate. Loves it. places issues regarding vulnerable people catching virus.

Singapore Middle Eastern countries CFR 0.05%. CFRs nearly always inflated due lack testing, IFRs would even lower. That's different infection patterns vulnerable less likely exposed. said, think lessons Vietnam, Thailand, South Korea, etc applicable. New Zealand could also list. example itself? might well telling strategies Middle Earth. significant portion citizenry Europe speak one language...so...not surprised all. US citizens (including myself) issue one language...

The schooling country set English only. embraced multilingual studies US, entitlement (especially ""you US, speak english) shit would likely go away time. also engenders globalism sheer nature multiple languages. likes grandfathers die pandemic illness, ok? really question whether ventilation systems handle task. recent study shows able recover infectious Coronavirus hospital environment 18 feet symptomatic patient. \[1\] room ""six air changes per hour fitted efficient filters, ultraviolet irradiation safety measures inactivate virus air reintroduced room"". I'm sure gyms good ventilation, good? Instead downvoting me, try part solution? still shedding jobs. stable yet. find balance 15% unemployment. yesterday grocery store entered, young person walked ahead, another grown adult male entered us. young person mask. adult male loudly questioned ‚Äúwhy doesn‚Äôt mask‚Äù? gained attention lackadaisical grocery store clerk, reluctantly responded giving young person mask wear store. young person asks, ‚Äúwhere go orientation‚Äù.

New Zealand right social distancing/masks COVID within country due strict border controls. Anyone weak minded without critical thinking skills, also includes atheists. 

You gotta constantly watch falling numerous fallacies bombarding mind 24/7. 8 times now, said yearly even end year, propably 10-20x times flu deaths big factor eventual recovery. said saw highest per-capita death rate world March peak sustained Countries coming July vs Italy UK went May.

COVID rapidly circulates indoor air - much outdoor, sunny environments.

This painfully obvious point Trump shrugs. good idea go vacation right place packed. really bad idea. RIP. serious problem feeling sorry yourself. horrible way look situation. woke. self loathing trying virtue signal way life Yep, im hear.ing one bit study pretty much useless antibody tests actually identify proper portion population virus. Finland, please take in!  proved clinically doesn‚Äôt live surfaces March.

Say surfaces. study U.S. National Institutes Health (NIH), researchers found virus causes COVID-19 live four hours copper, 24 hours cardboard, three days stainless steel plastic surfaces. Regularly clean disinfect commonly touched household surfaces ‚Äî tables, countertops, doorknobs, light switches, toilets, faucet handles sinks. know mean, US somehow world leaders. Money, tech, entertainment (military arsenal).. know means end, geopolitical scene first. Well sure serious situation, wouldn‚Äôt fixate much 40% specifically. tests dropping cases staying elevated, there‚Äôs going selectiveness getting tested (whether due supply constraints, local policies, self-motivated testing). even spread staying level, positivity rate skyrocket, people need get tested specific reason still get tested likely positive. 

This never liked positivity rate metric. It‚Äôs dependent amount testing, highly variable, selectiveness getting tested, also highly variable. 

If could measure positivity rate randomized population would mean lot more, assume test availability prevents happening volume. Bout time. Maybe lost cause all. true, people kind crazy comes products. Ya relevant virus. I'm fan him, plenty subreddits farm karma article like this.   That‚Äôs like 5 jumbo jets crashing *per day*.

So excess deaths year shrinking continue like may even end normal year.

While 100% confirmed, Vitamin deficiency best evidence base explanation. There's weaker evidence blood type, though difference at, best, week effect recent study shows vitamin deficiency correlating (but proving causal link) 10x increase mortality.

Testing, tracing quarantine. Good article showing work done. ""and ventilator"" Siberia hit 100 degrees F first time year. Phoenix AZ hit previous record 33 days 110+ degree heat last weekend, set hit 50+ total days year.

By chance- know link belgium coronavirus dashboard? found one couple weeks ago much info cannot find again. strange url Things slowed testing overall cases positive rates seem dropping. knew wearing masks creating limitations around areas groups people congregate works!

Alabama's mask mandate pointless. Saturday Aldi woman camo came without mask, grabbed stuff, went checkout, checked without saying word wearing mask one going challenge her.

I suspect trying cause ruckus. DHS reporting deaths death certificates ""confirmed Covid-19"". [way many dead bodies us keep back July. currently August nothing changed.

Rule 4: politics infighting delay lockdown Watch video brushes hair. technique could part problem. goes fake sympathy.

You reek gloating... 

Life continues normal croat friend, lockdown beg money again. False, lot data available vaccines like moderna Oxford vaccine.
Also Chinese vaccines show data. sure college dorm safe place pandemic... yacht probably registered Panama probably offshore every rich people international waters. Safe us scumbag Americans. I‚Äôd like see infection rate data it‚Äôs really masks, that‚Äôs really significant differing variable... especially n95s ... fit test public who‚Äôs interested ever get enough people literally breath easier around refuse wear mask knowing blockage significantly higher incoming particulates ‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs Netflix month?‚Äù Fellow hotelier here. feel you. training group that's visiting TX GA kick scream asked mask up. 

Or lie say breathing problems ""can't"" wear them. 

It's exhausting. remember reading story recently someone walked store took mask clerk asked put back said ""why? there‚Äôs nobody here"". Employees people think anyone ‚Äúcalled lazy‚Äù that‚Äôs chip shoulder. 

I‚Äôve seen Making huge distinction receive paycheck clearly point. sure, let‚Äôs rephrase ‚Äústaying home money they‚Äôve already paid summer‚Äù...semantics. 

Agreed disagree. It‚Äôs pretty big distinction me. Maybe I‚Äôm misreading you‚Äôre implying say. seem imply we‚Äôre sitting hoards money we‚Äôve paid nothing money. That‚Äôs true. don‚Äôt like job quit. going product choices made like anyone else. 

I quit one teaching position end last school year started new one school year. love teaching. never said didn‚Äôt like job. funds I‚Äôd take year crisis keep family safer. don‚Äôt luxury. FYI amount time spend something great metric merit productivity. 

I‚Äôm productive person hours I‚Äôm working actually getting work done. I‚Äôm working many hours I‚Äôm completely different class teaching last year. team I‚Äôm new learning management system we‚Äôre required use. I‚Äôve using system 4 years. I‚Äôve also helping numerous people school virtual meets learn use system. I‚Äôm masked working healthcare profession. help many frontline workers. 

Good you. I‚Äôm healthcare worker. I‚Äôm teacher. paychecks pu teachers stay home either lose job pay babysitter can‚Äôt afford bc kids can‚Äôt go school? nurses, cops, prison guards, grocery workers, electricians, (the list goes on) pay teachers salaries pay exorbitantly childcare (or lose/quit jobs) ‚Äúteachers feel safe‚Äù? 

Sure I‚Äôm really working take paycheck. I‚Äôm working. didn‚Äôt create childcare issue. empathize it. wish better government supports social programs help crisis. mask-up get work liek rest us? 

Because safer alternative. Shouldn‚Äôt demanding better government fighting other. Again, didn‚Äôt create crisis. didn‚Äôt make dangerous schools. I‚Äôve part. Others haven‚Äôt. 

And aren‚Äôt plenty people fully capable working jobs home well are? go back, shouldn‚Äôt they? think should. It‚Äôs slippery slope question decide deserves safety doesn‚Äôt. Shouldn‚Äôt trying get jobs remote, remote. Teaching be. Would like take pay cut amount work pay household budget job ‚Äú100% virtual?‚Äù...bc don‚Äôt feel safe, seriously

That‚Äôs asking government step part instead pointing finger different groups saying get back work. It‚Äôs easy way divide us all. 

I‚Äôm sorry don‚Äôt feel safe. really sucks. sentiment always seem lately ‚Äúi don‚Äôt feel safe shouldn‚Äôt feel safe either.‚Äù

While don‚Äôt want go back person school safer said switching person would go. need paycheck. wouldn‚Äôt go next group professions safely work home point say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm safe shouldn‚Äôt either.‚Äù safely work home, Simply put...what‚Äôs Like said, there‚Äôs lot easy answers here.

Yeah, you‚Äôre right. aren‚Äôt easy answers. don‚Äôt solution. I‚Äôm giving perspective. I‚Äôm scared go back work person. It‚Äôs safe. I‚Äôm busting ass working paycheck keeping son home too. I‚Äôm practicing I‚Äôm asking others. 

I haven‚Äôt anywhere except essentials since March. Gave taking son visit grandparents there‚Äôs pandemic going on. go mask up. 

I‚Äôm tired people judging profession they‚Äôre don‚Äôt see what‚Äôs happening inside. Don‚Äôt see hard majority us teachers working blithely say allude shouldn‚Äôt paid. It‚Äôs frustrating.

I worked events pre-covid photographer, first year really threw loop didn‚Äôt expect flirty behavior thrown way.

I always took compliment too- events worked tech healthcare, lot women events doctors surgeons tech entrepreneurs celebrated field... way fuck league.

Working events great people watching though, made realize age focused flirting tends be- sense men ages tend go flirt cute young women, middle aged women tend kind forgotten. Depends crowd event obviously- seem case. know that‚Äôs always kind thing, first time I‚Äôd really time pay attention.

As aside, playful flirting basically boiled talking said woman like person who‚Äôs interesting, everyone is, asking they‚Äôre living actually listening actively participating conversation them... kind sad bar. Obviously doesn‚Äôt flirty, depends body language, still. Sometimes things would get actually flirty, lady talking pushed conversation way, playful flirty body language treating people like smart, competent, interesting people are.

Edit: also work grocery store contact members general public 40 hours week. lot people currently sick point store may need shutdown. There‚Äôs definitely outbreak believe management covering up. Nah dumb. 'know' shit. Assume stupidity malice right time.

Just go mommy forums read stuff post there. God generalisations upvoted. complete opposite true. think I've seen one person looked young wearing mask whole time. Stop upvoting gross generalisations! would never happen large grocery stores care profits shareholders. care employees, care vendors, care you, money. young lady store near saying swap greeters every 1-2 hours harassment threats. 16 ffs trying productive member society time nasty people get paid stay home.  actually passed protect us exactly passed lol Oh humanity. almost like could avoided something try hard thank people least once. generally thank 2 3 times. sounds weird think hear enough even weird, hope helps little. plant workers need get class action, also need organize union. Hope next surgery done plumber electrician, since experts surgery.  self checkout whenever possible Hours* Going beach weak? Ummm... no, ignoring asymptomatic spread aerosolized transmission weak. calling places work Covid easily spread, offices, weak leaders news organizations refusing say anything ""weak"". 

Are dumb people wearing masks refusing take safety precautions? Yes. 

But there's also refusal many media hold accountable many systemic failures science (in U.S. especially) early usual ""perfect enemy good"" routine, shitting early outbreak studies, asking extraordinary evidence ""masks work"" willing recommend wearing them, ignoring asymptomatic spread, ignoring airborne transmission, penning petition JUNE PNAS order paper extolling virtues masks removed ""lack evidence."" 

Just fuck off. Oh yeah, here's remember scientist MSNBC saying call center study restaurant study ""inconclusive"" enough warrant concern airborne transmission surfaces, never really made sense. Five months FIVE MILLION U.S. cases later, scientist others like yet better studies early contact traced outbreaks places like South Korea.

Then there's stunning indictment ego, hubris, arrogance highest levels breath fresh air reddit AMA last week practical advice... also indicted ""perfect enemy good/absence evidence"" crowd one first 2 3 another scientist, weeks admit aerosolized transmission, continued deny possible - attempts get I'm keeping plenty came cause story written, part something seriously fucking wrong usually unimpeachable science(!) egotists approach job needs addressed. people laboring fringes trenches usually turn right still face welcome Galileo. wish could upvote headline thousand times extra money would, SSI struggle itself.

I hope kind attitude enough. NYC sending kids school big test. people going start getting g reinfected, that‚Äôs would happen. 

If does, RIP stock market, economy, normalcy vaccine.  believe it, actually going doctor. Rip. yeah flu less contagious. good Rona, flu get you. Australia almost zero flu cases winter. Tell they're psycho. Cause normal behavior think see people don't. think invulnerable, not. think take statistics face value know everything, don't. think society figured contrarian matter what...but not. things make ""real""? make look like asshole.

Life humble you. Maybe take it, everything let happen again. Maybe yet to. Either way, matter time.

It took substantially longer feel 100%. peru mid june, left. curfews nothing, (and others) would parties people would sleep leave 4am curfew ended. government wouldnt allow types gatherings pushed everything indoors police/military wouldnt know. spreading like crazy cause packed markets Even medium scale they‚Äôre inefficient! pretty weak testing, too, quite late close borders Italy. virus can't spread go see people. lockdown takes. would okay that.

In fact I'll go one further, think every close contact found via contact tracing put quarantine 14 days. willing go happens me. prove shootin that‚Äôs alright too. They‚Äôll say died antifa assassinated something deep state faked cause death. know there's technically assumed number yet. Experts crunch numbers types deaths dropped pandemic others increased come ""accurate"" conclusion. really say right subtracted known COVID deaths equation, we'd 200,000 excess deaths right now. 

If 5 years someone parses data finds every expected death broke even speak except car crash deaths decreased 50,000 particular time frame (an exaggeration I'm using example), could realistically say COVID killed roughly 250,000 people March 15th August 1st. happens though, we're basically left assume 200,000 people would've alive due COVID cause otherwise happened. Nah, treat like hard working heroes front lines pandemic. Da‚Äô FuQ about? new 'Nerd!' sign/signal. cultural touchstone really interesting see. case countries world.

Quick back en envelope calculation:

Extremely easy, comfortable hours, pay expect get. That's obscene amount people accurate. also puts real fatality rate around 1%-2%. Basically think must've arrived much earlier thought spread like wildfire reason. Hence saying hope stop tracks üëå hear well, honestly good anti body test? LOL AMERICA LOL AMERICA I‚Äôm cashier customers talk shit talk shit right back. get absolutely shocked every time. go chill nice motel 2 weeks.

Seems antibody tests accurate know know know it. addition known knowns known unknowns unknown unknowns get false knowns, false unknowns, questionable unknown knowns. Shocking dude's hilarious One interesting thing look serious studies looked 2020 flu season - nonexistent. social distancing obliterated flu year. 

People worried fall, I'm not. we're distancing all, flu obliterated. mean, COVID people even wash hands. got close personal. Shared glasses, breathed others' air. distancing, everything's shared. Travel world country everyday. Even moderate distancing we've done big deal.

I actually begun really doubt movies like Outbreak Contagion. mega deadly 25% IFR virus, people would social distancing like crazy 2-4 weeks later everyone would either get sick, isolated die isolated. people could cautiously go normal.

COVID's less-than-apocalyptic lethality makes damn bad. reasonable middle pandemic, thousands keep going bars schools open like that's going work. would happening IFR 25%.

On hand, spite bar-goers, social distancing occuring still dwarfs ""normalcy"".

I think flu season year. But, continue COVID season. We're still stuck fallacy ""the heat it"" excuse extroverts told hoping March panic would last couple months with.

Nope, flu season. another long COVID season, maybe worse outcomes due immunity problems. Keep hanging man, you!  First up, great job NZ!! one deny suffering achievement country.

I India. went similar ""severe lockdown"", turned pretty bad terms numbers far! Perhaps difficult lock developing country 1.3 billion people. But, I'm happy behaving bad US least!

Also, till free movement states began June ending, city Bangalore 12 million people less 400 (cumulative total) cases, despite us allowed close borders. last month though, cases shot 2000 per day Bangalore itself. Hope get back control soon.

Edit: Saw news 4 new cases NZ! Let‚Äôs hope quell well figure came from!

Edit again: enough karma post earlier. probably invisible! jump bridge see god catches her. #it‚Äôs hot Florida, right? hope never case.

People start take care better baffles healthcare (in country) doesnt focus prevention. fact obese people health issues.

Not fat-shaming people, im insulting people general, important people start realize detrimental health. smoking tax heavily, sugar feed doesnt containt nutricinal value?  HK currently outbreak centre region? I'm 100% ignorant they're to, never stated otherwise. Thanks links!
I guess best way put gone way see fringes interest. pressing things look time, ignorance topic grows.
Good stuff sent way! Grocery workers humans?   realize essential grocery workers also easily exchangable therefor noone management company cares them? react fear loose sales (e.g. Amazon least something). like jump straight ignorance completely ignore logic reasoning. Makes sense üëç That's hairpiece, that's trapdoor squirrel ate brain comes goes night.  friends mother got plasma treatment. increasing levels oxygen doctors getting nervous. believe saying giving 11 something like that. got plasma days ago oxygen.  would interested know ive without knowing, feels like something people simply wont know, nations wont test mass. believe everyone working grocery stores around world among first get vaccine least get free even everyone else pay it. They've probably dangerous position entire time least pay...  I‚Äôve eat times think customers good time treating wait staff nicely. Maybe it‚Äôs live, even wait staff seems polite before. (Generally speaking course, I‚Äôve seen psycho Karen videos) valves closable. close them. lot Swedes underlying health complications spend time locked apartments. obvious reasons run street. Like nature people run street, bars etc going people least worried covid. Probably backlog weekend. not, spikes expected downward trend still there. So, let's say case ""permanent damage"" ""disability"" occurs.

Even so, fact case right 10% corona recoveries people experiencing long-term afteraffects minimum make continuing normal life difficult.

In best cases, like mild cold mild fever, never ever goes away.

""Wow, sounds awful. hearing it?

We hearing tens thousands *deaths*. yet, notice long-term effects definitely happening.

So even pacemaker, get 10-20 years shaved life, see new specialists... might still bad health never 100% rest life.

Wow, yes, would big deal. Yet, place right public narrative manage story yet.

This ""let 'er rip"" herd immunity thing bad news. usually 1.3x reported number based excess mortality. pretty consistent US modern western countries. countries handled allowing companies furlough lay employees, survive government assistance pandemic.


That makes companies individuals weather pandemic fine, course that's America. makes mad 9/11 deaths every 2-3 days front line workers seeing significant raises service increased risk. includes healthcare workers put families lives line every single day. Yeah I've never really like term ""essential worker"", makes sound like companies society giving ends stick. I'm partial ""mandatory workers"" that's tourists doing?

You right-wing fascist. behavior regardless whether person left right. 

BYEEEEEEE hard time getting groceries last week instacart shoppers. Everyone phone literally front face rushing past anyone way, cutting anyone path- without slightest acknowledgement consideration. spoke manager way cashiers within earshot silently applauded thanked way out. didn‚Äôt know say. felt bad, way out, maybe never going back! work there. Seriously. Bless hearts. 
I don‚Äôt know manger do, know he‚Äôs responsible shoppers personal behavior, it‚Äôs problem.

Plus, curbs appetite, helps hungry time.

I think something changed western diet cause this. HFCS possibility. Welcome biker culture ::buries head sand:: North Carolina shouldn‚Äôt included here. nearly cases Florida touch Tennessee total cases they‚Äôre spiking NC plateauing. Robot governors?

Roy Cooper (D) governor NC fairly strict reopening implemented statewide mask mandate. placed restrictions school reopenings. literally refused allow Trump RNC non-socially distanced convention.

Florida Tennessee, yeah, potus robot governors sounds right. basically everybody together, nobody's allowed leave, still taking precautions minimise spread case get in. still plenty mask wearing, disinfecting, etc. case, plus really strict control everyone coming make sure they're clear way in. 

This possible virus thankfully *that* contagious stuff. still ship food, room service, etc long take precautions direct contact. cleaning lady need bubble, players room comes in.

Assholes like fact actually got sick July made easy quit. yup Quarantine home work, that's Wuhan tried first I'm pretty sure one enforce quarantine home level strictness Wuhan could manage.

Are countries already effectively quarantine home? working it? Obama drone striking teenage US citizen... minimal outside bare minimum get past posting restrictions. lot people view retail workers lower caste, free abuse. one place store manager forced cashiers deli workers push ups punishment. 

Had break room full managers employees tell fuck asked friendly gesture.

Had hours dropped 15 3 hours per week, whenever management felt like passing probation. asked hours dropping told store manager received disability benefits time.

These high-end grocers. work kinds places anymore. tell, highly toxic cultures many people working places part problem participate it. 

In context, I'll say managers ones responsible maltreatment happened places, leave that. frickin mess! wait mid-September schools open couple weeks. nothing wrong *offering* free quarantine place I'm sure many reasonable people would take offer. mandatory part possibly counterproductive.

 matter ethically acceptable, medically right thing etc.... *metric counts* is, measure even *helping* fight. one might hurting it, reducing populations willingness cooperate early detection cases. 

*Offering* isolated (well cared for) quarantine plus *regularly controlled* home quarantine alternative *mandatory* isolation break jone quarantine seems better way go.  case, actually love job. scary husband‚Äôs health conditions - it‚Äôs catch 22.... would quit could, would lose insurance.

Because shows cases varied much less clear correlation positive rates increasing testing rates decrease.

Obviously is. understand unfortunately I'm sick explaining 100th time.

Anyway, still explained hospitalizations much whilst cases exponentially increasing. Neither explained TMC reporting 15% states tests, whilst 10% positive rate. Neither explained CLI ILI data Texas plummeting. Neither explained deaths plateauing whilst cases still exponentially increasing.

Ranging flat one, nose pulling talk sneeze. much would like belive doctors gods human prone mistakes even dispite training.

Second life outside work, people exposed untrained humans. Kids wives girlfriends friends etc provide risk exposure. Let alone feeling like private life controlled government leading hosting party's, going holidays drinks friends.

In closing, we're human. Somthing like say ""give 100 people 1 task find 110 ways it"".

TL;DR people can't follow training rules even could die. called Darwin award. Public health != healthcare paid for

Side note: Get vitamin tested speak primary care physician. Studies shown vitamin deficiencies higher mortality rate infectious COVID. We, medical providers, probably begin discussing findings/papers school district administration. Well depends restaurant, ive seen places masks nothing else. Although air buffer helps, would also argue window open would help pull air building. people leaning windows closes gap. Finally kinda boils takes little effort put mask usually less 2 minute interaction. huge relief workers helps feel little better front lines.

[Racial Disproportionality Covid Clinical good quick read: 

[Vaccine Trials Need Reflect America‚Äôs (MUST READ!)

The COVID-19 vaccine, hot button topic past months now, clinical trials. different versions vaccine made different companies. companies done Phase 1/2 clinical trial gearing Phase 2/3. Phase 1/2 clinical data published.

Phase 1/2 clinical trial determine (1) vaccine work, (2) proper dosage, (3) side effects. important phase clinical trial. 

**[We know aside age sex, ethnic racial background big determinant individual react mind, big problem Black, Latinx, Asians, Native American, Indigenous recruited COVID-19 vaccine clinical Latino people three times likely white people become infected COVID-19 twice likely die, according federal data obtained via lawsuit New York Times. Asian Americans appear account fewer cases higher rates death. make 13percent U.S. population average 5percent clinical trial participants, research shows. Hispanics, trial participation 1percent average, though account 18percent pressure produce effective vaccine quickly pandemic could sideline efforts ensure diversity, said Dr. Kathryn Stephenson,** director clinical trials unit Center Virology Vaccine Research Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Boston. going focus 4 big clinical trials done places diverse population. urge look percentage racial demographic represented clinical trials. (Usually bracket like this) participants make 78-91% participants study even though demographics disproportionately affect COVID-19 one virtually excluded studies. unacceptable. 

As companies begin Phase 2/3, recruit people. best interest call better recruitment method Phase 2/3. 

These companies also funded taxpayer money (we talking billions dollars) research aid, clinical trials, vaccine production. fair due diligence recruiting populations underrepresented clinical trials. 

**These clinical trials need reflect diversity population funding development** frog thing untrue, FYI

I mean southern states fucked, frogs certainly jump hot water reaches certain threshold state followed CDC's recommendation slowly re-open 14 days declining cases. ghetto... else expect happen comes large group black women?   Double entendre there, see.

I fully expect COVID-19 kill Americans real numbers Spanish Flu (i.e. ~675,000). even surprised killed adjusted numbers (~2 million). Can't infect others get virus first place thanks N95. beside, even valved ones still reduce speed spread exhaust. average surgical mask leaky hell sides well, so.

This feels like pointless regulation given useless mask types still allowed. Black women mean yeah included one covid positive person. They‚Äôve gone quarantine incubator see? It'll take years know true numbers, even yearly flu deaths estimated. 

We'll likely never know many average deaths due elective surgeries canceled put care ailments chronic illnesses. Lol thanks. want hear think smart higher paying job most. get like big scholarship grew troubled neighborhood? Sweden tried close homes elderly, courts refused this. wondering MN higher # deaths far, due long term care facilities getting hit hard, much early on. accurate all. invented numbers. Masks help probability transmission 90% situation, we'd looking billions cases now, millions. think fake information good cause makes sense, keep science. someone they've already living family exposed it. like get instantly diagnosed second it. time tested positive would better quarantine entire household.  Sounds like success me, current ones overpaid obviously idea doing. tell it. forced jobs close refuse vote continuing enhanced UI benefits. literally want force people risk lives work Starbucks Mcdonalds Walmart low wage part time jobs. Living America become literal nightmare, born here, college degree. people dont understand Yeah. think worried eg frozen food handlers risk much higher Australia minority people haven‚Äôt found home they‚Äôve check home quarantine - pretty clear people can‚Äôt trusted. !remindme 2 months everyone virus know yet?!

At point said ""I'm sorry, can't anymore. wrong. End discussion."" also pretty much end evening. test take weeks get back essentially worthless. agree. Holy shit, true know of?

You really underestimate American stupidity, perhaps become normalized it. Things like rest developed world. going health minister, Fernando Simon, saying, actively tracing testing catching cases infection (~70%). Compared March peak testng capacity limited catching around 10% cases.

/s COVID get Australia? ship plane? know U.S. got it, Italy, Spain, really Australia. Right seems like factor time. UK posted 14, 20 deaths last two days. US posted 1504, 1386.

UK current death per mill 608. US needs 24 1300 death days beat it. True, case everywhere. headline misleading suggests reporting issue US elsewhere, fact it‚Äôs opposite rates underreporting low US compared rest world Redheads synthesize vitamin without sunlight. mutation causes redheadedness M1CR gene. messes hair color (as noted comment above), unexpected effects mutation. Since M1CR function correctly even exposed sun, speculated evolutionary pressure causing redheads synthesize vitamin D.

Hmm studios need cinemas that, need Netflix Amazon. Depends state.

(How know country fucking stupid entire life? knew stupidity rampant, stupid?) algorithm assumes reporting issues, clearly are. chance hospitalizations decrease much cases continue increase exponentially. TMC numbers much accurate.

If assume numbers accurate, would imply TMC currently like 15% testing statewide. hospital. Yeah no.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fault‚Äù fat , overweight, got insulin resistance, gonna hard time covid. That's literally exactly said. 'Found cases decreasing'. making harder determine Rt, rising plot posted.

Turned vitamin levels floor. tested 12 ng/dl. Anything 20 considered deficient. Anything 30 considered low. year 50,000 IU green pill week, finally tested 33 ng/dl. take daily 2000 UI keep levels normal.

And got energy back. Calling people idiots obsessively cleaning quarantining everything sight bit rich. Nevermind fact article restating information we've known since start pandemic. Sure do. feel sorry people can‚Äôt control themselves. also know personal responsibility way it. It‚Äôs culture‚Äôs fault, anyone else‚Äôs fault all.

I‚Äôd suggest seriously engaging anyone sake mental health. school system opted tell anyone anything. ""It's privacy thing."" opened 10 days ago ever since people posting FB kids sent home coming contact positive. LOT posts too. desperately trying cover cases up.

(like last two years flu outbreaks got bad 15 percent staff sick) masks! forget masks! recycling air start to... wait forgot point... fifteen hundred deaths...soon zero thought school closed sterilize two weeks?? think go Mars beyond, making one place enough insurance. 

If Earth nuclear war, warheads allocated Martian friends, too. Seems unlikely they'd completely separate society political system. disregard prisoners disregard guards also. sides aisle furious, one is. Same. really hit first sleep much better, expecting all.

Are Russian bot something? I'm curious working hard spread many false claims. Still 2 days state difficult times healthcare system

What mean? health system anywhere near overwhelmed anyone says otherwise bought media much.

To honest I've really impressed infrastructure kept skyrocketing demand. Still greatest country world.

If anything, GoFundMe really rising occasion. record numbers signs slowing down. doomsayers months ago [got People, literally linked Onion. know harder harder distinguish reality satire days, but... worst part hoax idiots use validation. Unfortunately, could *trespass* people. understand that. profitable movie studios likely survive this. Disney certainly going anywhere. Smaller studios might risk could benefit VOD.

Regardless, movie studios movie theaters sort symbiotic relationship. major movie studios let theaters collapse, they'll pretty much forced go VOD anyway.

One thing scares we're probably going see significant creative drain movies (if permanent). heading path anyway, especially proliferation super hero movies. behemoth Disney probably going take opportunity absorb competitors beyond Fox. many deaths today ? Blood types affect likelyhood illness. Anything cold goes straight fridge freezer 

that's virus survives. 

Am suggesting getting food depend much cold storage? Yes. There's reason meatpacking facilities hotspots  Nothing comment relevant response mine. ok there? That‚Äôs doc saying. encouraged look studies dermatologist , really digging deep helps us. It‚Äôs like key immune system. anyway long story short , dude started talk , research , sunblock doesn‚Äôt help absorb , sunblock companies got upset .. guess rest. original point , it‚Äôs newer research it‚Äôs extremely vital us People mostly coming work endless soup salad, lot frail elderly too. WTF people! ok, apples-to-oranges comparison also *additional* way, comparing one grocery outing one dining experience - account different numbers meals.

pick fallacy NO! individuals. medical system whole work. fight single individual seek superstar. problem far FAR complex single person even group. said various labs, hospitals, institutes efficient real-time collaboration networks. whole effort swamped failure. yea herd immunity still works. managed immunize 70% population won‚Äôt transmitting keeping old people safe. Thats probably least issues russian vaccine fact trumps response increasing deaths testing insane. Man, woman , dying , tests , increase. UK tried ""herd immunity"" anti-COVID response like month, aka deliberately nothing got control. It‚Äôs Q-a-n-o-n. (Mods won‚Äôt let say words). ignore it. could galaxy brained paragons logic are

My feeble mind makes dislike people die preventable deaths stupid policy choices Seriously, don‚Äôt take lightly. sub huge mob hot takes like aligning views get upvoted even *overt* lies. Section 230 nothing selecting content appropriate broadcast audiences though.  generally can't sued user posts. necessary, else every large social media site would shut due staff pre-approve content made every subscriber. moderation policy affect status law. Notice carefully said 'Critical mass' 'majority'.

But thanks correcting wrong, jerk.

Blocking jerk. understand geographical difference large, fact people migrating country get away local hotspots. 

It‚Äôs distance makes states ‚Äúlike separate countries,‚Äù it‚Äôs state governance legislature choosing enforce policy - ‚Äúwear masks,‚Äù ‚Äúno one allowed wear masks,‚Äù etc. 

States power this, don‚Äôt think power refuse national mandate, ever happen. 

My state regional health districts able mandate masks despite municipal state orders. state course trying remove power health districts. got 200k Sep 30 office deadpool.

I trying make comment fact new information changes protocol, lot new information coming in. people used paying active attention scientific discovery made worried conflicting information. 

People scared information changing, expect every change we're probably horning correct path. Maybe show data 20x harder virus transmission outdoors suggest shows outside. ultimately decision make can't force her. like Joker nurse meme, reverse. Fucking idiot. Ground truth Project. Another political group spreading shit like pay taxes, since ""non-profit"". saw lady television saying health workers getting infected removing ppe. accidentally touching it. Maybe pedantic removing ppe. don‚Äôt drink it, it‚Äôs isopropanol- ingredient used hand sanitizers pre-Covid. blown proportion get Biden elected

You know, read takes like realize America really reaping sowed. invested much education. mask spread covid?

I heard rumor masks actually spread covid. true? 1,499 deaths today Great news. virus way less deadly ever imagined. get called ""hero"" US, everyone sees ""hero"" title reward. can't ask that's heroes do. deserve heroes expected sacrifice. longer human, abstract concept, get conceptually fucked ass without lube. ask retired military guys. vast majority laugh ""thank service"" people.

If ever end part group people get called ""heroes"" I'd immediately start trying immigrate different country. reality would vastly different Americans got act together. depressing. fuck people stoic everything? things still suck even can't change it? kind attitude prevents anything changing better first place. said, properly bring frozen waffles shrimp temp eat them, still destroy virus. COVID-19 particularly heat resistant, temperature kills viral infections also destroys readily. Thaw meat refrigerator separate food (in bowl fridge, example), cold water need quickly, immediately cook thoroughly.

Same rules apply normal really, turns CDC may well wrong fomites primary transmission vector need still disinfecting packaging avoiding raw foods.  that's making assumptions unknown proportion population changes behavior. would economic devestation virus alone sure, basically impossible calculate, almost assuredly lockdowns hurt economy worse.

The difference though destroying economies, saved possibly millions lives already Also, peer pressure, like RINO, conform ""in"" group. People actively discouraged thinking themselves.  Funny jumping one irrelevant claims whilst completely ignoring horribly wrong been, literally last comment, every comment well.

I remember reading Nate Silver praised Youyang Gu's model, maybe could dig cba. could well 30 experts I'm following praising (see C.T Bergrstrom Yann Lecun). 

""Its superior accuracy also noted Silicon Valley newspaper [*The Mercury [*The called ""more accurate forecasts many established comments basically prove masks going permanent. Everyone seems love them. Clearly I‚Äôm majority wanting burn vaccine distributed.  hypothetical you. wear high quality valved N95 mask everywhere go public, chances getting low. chances getting low, chances spreading also low. understand argument can‚Äôt spread don‚Äôt have, matter mask I‚Äôm wearing. 

I know can‚Äôt know sure catch know way stop getting 100%, trust guy standing next vented N95 handmade masks, it‚Äôs better stopping spreading me, it‚Äôs good stopping first place. 



Just point view... depends many ACE2 cell receptors endothelial cells, cells lining Lungs (endothelial cells found parts body as, well, Lungs entry point virus). ACE2 lock SARS-COV-2 virus picks, using S-spike protein. 

The likelihood falling ill depends many ACE2 cell receptors endothelial cells have. 

ACE2 increases age, also depends healthy are. Obesity, smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease associated higher expression ACE2.

Why happen, well normal metabolism cells, cells generate highly reactive oxygen compounds called free radicals. Cells evolved billions years sophisticated ways mopping free radicals. ACE2 happens involved, along Angiostenin-II, mopping free radicals reducing cellular oxidative stress endothelial cells. 

The risk factors increase cellular oxidative stress, cells respond increasing number ACE2 cell receptors, increasing fight free radicals. 

The virus uses ACE2 cell receptor latch onto cells reproduce. higher ACE2 easily virus infect you. higher ACE2 expression likely suffer severe illness possibly die. 

This virus blocks ACE2 cells unhealthy, due obesity, diabetes, heart disease smoking, virus blocks cells ability control cellular oxidative stress.

As result, virus cause endothelial cells malfunction die, releasing compounds blood cause Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome blood clots.

This far less likely happen healthy however. recommending schools fully reopen?

They never recommended that. always caveat ‚Äúwhere done safely‚Äù.  got lost headlines. Sorry, yes you‚Äôre right ! gotta stop simplifying way. Also I‚Äôm expert , got ton info last doc visit relevant üòÇ want educate world vitamin ! feel like Portlandia episode joke raw milk solving health problems never understand people... made up.

OK, since missed comparison number reported ""confirmed cases""... look up. today, 315,000.

So, amount people who've ten times amount confirmed testing. That's.... wow.

So mean number US, example, might actually 52 million rather 5.2? Crazy. customer service position deal public day long. job hinges ability deal people. 

You're fucking apologist moron. Something Southern states dysfunctional, consistently fare worse many metrics regarding society. Usually mild dogs exceptions happen.

I'm good one! wearing mask since February lately, one seems like around wearing except workers. state trouble cases slowing down. still give two shits. Corona love, preying mantis sex situation.... That's well good last heard, London police saying going respond calls reporting maskless people? Hand bear mace teenage workers. Family size pack. so. quit teaching job month ago. Nowhere seems want skill set. can‚Äôt even get past ATS‚Äôs online teaching jobs. market totally flooded teachers specialized skill sets it‚Äôs almost impossible transfer another job without starting totally bottom totem pole. :( not. talking excess deaths overall, C-19 Yes, home?

The lake house? condo beach? ski chalet? Huh, one? What's like? seems lot coverage lot thought behind science masks Etsy Macy's say! college health center work testing sewage dorms able know outbreaks. fucking sick shit. job! mine decades get piddly shit money now? $193/wk ain‚Äôt gonna hack Los Angeles. gonna it.
I‚Äôm sorry flipping pissed sorry worse me. survive? I‚Äôm sad mad once. Thanks letting vent. know say probably, happened. protested it, called grip. ""It's another gripper."" called really bad cold back then. Covid good reason un-obese yourself. Better most, actually. Oh, well, fact inconvenient

&amp;#x200B;

edit: /s even close true.

* 1918: 17 million deaths

* 2020: 750,000 deaths. COVID-19 deaths could literally increase 1000% still small fraction deaths 1918.

It's already 20 times less. Increase 1000% 1/3. small like comparing double homicide Holocaust.

Double homicide: 2 dead. Holocaust: 6,000,000 dead. 300,000,000% difference. Unless holocaust denier, even close comparable: covid-19 750,000; 300,000,000% would 2 trillion dead spanish flu.

Your two stats even jive other, much less reality. Nah, fuck 'em. Make sure everyone wants get it. team death cult want. irony contradicting CDC ""science first approach"". Person taking account medical advancements weve made since then? much harder keep people alive back now. nurses around basically burnt apathy enforce mask usage, simplest easiest thing could possibly do, way done contact tracing. pretty ridiculous. see Germans embrace Nazi flag ""it's history can't erase it"". lot people like toddlers. ""Well they're allowing it, must okay!"" too, dude. Thanks. May/June even sub full people mockingly saying ""wAiT tWo WeEkS"" IMMEDIATELY see new cases states reopening I've essentials mode since March, live alone. thought socializing anyone outside living space discouraged; become irrelevant? Asymptomatic transmission bad symptomatic transmission. [recent study 303 infected ~36% asymptomatic. study aimed viral load comparison asymptomatic vs symptomatic. find alarming many asymptomatic people are, temperature taking kind like kids brush teeth; pointless.
I say say, think wearing mask whenever leave house taking get back home safest way. know masks really help, completely prevent it. know you, reading studies many people left lasting respiratory issues wanting risk it. mental health suffering, doubt it. someone experience, amount mental health matters I'm dead. 

Oh my, went Reddit rant. wanted say others work home really anything else. :/ hard, that's sacrifice make. 

/end rant

Edit: missed words rant; imagine that. Article source
  Though followed ""roaring twenties"" economic boom Fauci top game, solid support network around him. Working level requires dedicated local support network collaborators. takes lot work time build kind resilience career. current environment it‚Äôs increasingly difficult early career scientists build networks support necessary. Obviously, he‚Äôs fuckin child. It‚Äôs impossible police everything, society needs look following guidelines. Back covid pretty major depressive anxiety fill time went different doctor first time gave blood test. winter much said extremely vitamin deficient. doctor believe low numbers explained could affect dopamine brain works make less effective something like that. sure cause earlier year. vitamin pills actually helped antidepressants anxiety pills ever have. work outside sun every day I'm sure feel like less vitamin since then. vitamin helps covid hope body getting enough sunlight really want get another blood test find cause would needless trip doctors. Currently I'm bad time depression anxiety think that's line stress covid social isolation lack sleep mixed 6 every day (I'm naturally nocturnal. Even healthy sleep getting hard body extended periods time also can't eat liquids early day really messes stomach bad) much handle.

I think I'm deficient vitamin like back though cause keep motivated work energy way walk across room times day mean. point would assume entire school. Same. youngest 4, he's autistic, mentally around 2ish. times flat refuses wear mask. lack solid communication makes hard tell, either sensory trigger simply understanding WHY. Sometimes get wear one small amount time get excited Mommy wearing mask too, even better Daddy comes us one well. feels included. soon gets uncomfortable way, comes off.

So take anywhere right now. He's house trip 3 times since March. first moved, went old house new one. second third doctor visits. One catch missed vaccines due nightmare, he's ER baby likes try regular basis. time needed x-rays leg. fine. 

But otherwise, neither kids public. hate understand, 4 year old much 7 year old neurotypical understand bit why... Though even completely get it.

We start 100% virtual schooling Monday. protect them, protect mother MIL live us high risk. Hubby essential personnel, that's enough risk is... contemplated daily since March. Better die broke homeless thanks US senate right, let's find way make .04% positivity rate sound bad I'd like think people follow quarantine - break twice 14 days. hey why'd first comment get removed? agree mentioned much another comment somewhere thread. 

Would mind going people worked saying? think lot people doubting disease heard real horror stories many medical community witnessed. I'm guessing correct statement would be:

""Thankfully, since cold weather went away, non-Covid-19 mortality fallen hard."" i.e. I'm assuming seasonal effect ""background"" mortality rate. YEEeEeEEHAAAaaAAW Probably year. rich people matter lie. CDC Bunch criminals. need sweeping government financial aid program save industry. situations like can't make heads tails virus. flipping crap shoot who's going get it, who's going get really sick it, who's going end dying it. feel like that's good tradeoff. Mandatory french kissing high-fives! honestly one biggest problems US government one talks it. kind term limits making easier run office would make world difference country. Comparing Sweden neighbors ignorance whole new level.
Sorry dream Sweden worst case world come true. Figure comments deleted, smart guy least knows NDA scarcity. big boy words! 

Stay fucking safe.   think means fortnite boobsmcgee@yahoo.com. Worked great me. They've way years. ""So said people, 'Please, slow testing down!'""

Looks like made happen. course, deaths harder hide cases. think Beyond little better Impossible. seems bit meat-like. 

Hardee's Beyond Thickburger feel definitely better Burger King's Impossible Whopper. 

When McDonald's supposed bring Beyond burger? _personal_ risk though. risking people's health safety choose run around without taking precautions, ""well *I'm* young healthy probably die anything"". 

It's like drunk driving - get decide want take risk ""have great tolerance"" ""drunk drivers usually survive collision"". sober, putting people high level risk fun life convenient considered unacceptable. CDC talking excess suicides drug overdoses months now. FDA announced shortage Zoloft early June. would long time someone coming depression, scheduling doctor‚Äôs appointment, getting diagnosis, picking prescriptions. isn‚Äôt recent back work thing. seem missed news 50-80% infected people symptoms still shed virus. America  Republicans. Always fucking Republicans. could Covid all. need accurate numbers takes testing often wonder headlines...my response 90% ‚Äúyes, common sense, exactly Autorisierte it?‚Äù Maybe Vit deficiency seen 
10x increase mortality every kind sickness? Maybe sign state body succumbing death general? unaware unemployment got gutted pretending enough pay rent? Please, no. virus care. Pain killing stuff varying sometimes useless me. Even maximum dosage (triple 'normal'?) supposedly enough age 50+ out-patient visit type thing. Apparently painful - perhaps due tumor suppose - really work expected. least recall experience twilight.

On hand general anesthesia works spectacularly. quickly, quickly, zero issues. I've several times like brain &amp; body get put pause. Last time woke up, reached grab charts startled doctor came me, back-to-normal.

Over counter painkillers either perfect (aspirin FTW) useless (acetaminophen among others). fun lol. love comparing numbers calculation methods global pandemic we're itüòÖ.    

-That's take away anything debates here, honestly think good figure certain proclamations really mean... Just, know, depressing- power. push win like 2018, senate fall. I'm going polls n95 mask gloves. Join me. Well say Oklahoma. way many OU OSU tired ""kids get symptoms"" argument. totally ignores kids live school. go home people, work people, etc...

And sign online-only, school district basically guilts ""emotional health"". sent teenager in-person, would person leaving house - husband works home. I'm pretty sure would way, way worse live knowing one brought house me, high-risk Mom. Kids going end knowing inadvertently responsible killing family members. Especially yo mama.



(Sorry resist) they're called vegetables /s clarify, means wanting worthless fucks working running life.  not, major genetic factors.  Yes danger fomites (we're still even really sure whether primary role specifically COVID) stay surfaces three days longer.

And microdroplets stay air three hours max.

So eliminate fomites eliminate long term transmission inside building.

The problem microdroplets getting everyone. Everyone wear mask rapid testing temperature checks anyone building.

It's honestly impossible task even trained fight it. literally impossible laymen.

Best thing close schools everyone stay home. love act like Biden going win. That‚Äôs got one funniest comments Reddit. I‚Äôve washing groceries since covid first started. don‚Äôt even go grocery shopping anymore, it‚Äôs delivered me. won‚Äôt allow delivery person home either, wear mask around case. don‚Äôt like atms touching cash anymore. wonder ever go back normal, new normal? ventilators, covid could kill nearly quickly Spanish flu did. crash, go seeming fine intubated quickly. least that's people work saying. We've lost people ER call ambulance soon enough. Link data please. able fine one study (the one people repeatedly quote here) study literally admits protests caused increase spreading mostly offset people fearful leave homes. fucking data readily available look at, 3 days Memorial Day festivities led spreading 3 months BLM protesting.

BLM protests literally started memorial day weekend. interesting timing, eh? interesting every outbreak linked someone attended protest followed ""there's way that's got it"". interesting average age people infected COVID stable right protests started plummeted 15 years. interesting following protests cases spiked disproportionately black community. big coincidence though Im sure. 10s thousands people standing shoulder shoulder every night 2.5 months surely impact. 

Lmao exactly I'm talking about. Fauci replaced man, man actually said herd immunity impeded, much blatant sign people need president care many Americans die 2020 global coronavirus pandemic? last time went October gf visiting say 1917. probably last time either us go theater long despite us livin together like 6 months lol Bite tongue. OU Oklahoma University they‚Äôre like donkey Kong. still don‚Äòt get say, right? 

The main point trying convey is: DON‚ÄòT WASTE TESTS PEOPLE TWO SYMPTOMS.

Test everyone else. 


How get this? outnumber obviously give shit you. list things lose drastically evaporating.  27 years, thats close enough it? Lazy, rich fuckers. Dems Housebill done May, Conservatives couldn‚Äôt decided amongst do. Dems would compromise GOP wouldn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs Senate Republicans held Senate hostage 10years. Mitch McConnell blight earth. go explain ‚ÄúThe Dems‚Äù please enlighten us. We've relegated relief package ""too hard basket"" now, make ""thoughts prayers..."" really confuses insisting ‚Äúno evidence transmission via food food packaging‚Äù. packaging another surface we‚Äôve known long virus spread via surfaces. Otherwise bother washing hands seconds avoiding touching mouth eyes? nice simpsons reference. forced? Didnt willingly apply job? dont like it, go work somewhere else. What's wrong that? 
I understand sickness frightening needs dealt with, I'm sure taking away one comforts people still right answer. r/goodnews even possible US government incompetent point? Er... first sentence reply? Try attacking posters like this, please. serve community service Phoenix, home either Las Vegas Los Angeles, that's probably good enough punishment. Agreed. hysteria sub crazy sometimes. scared go outside ok, one stop staying in. Restaurants live expanding patios really well it. They've going extra mile ensure safety. restaurant's patio looks makeshift adequate open air go in. health department fining closing spots follow guidelines. feel lot less safe going grocery stores large public closed air spaces bite eat restaurant outside 6 ft apart tables lol. know science rapid detox? Sounds like good jobs program.  nose best. Make better life choices, group dynamic sets feel safe group starting violence. That‚Äôs pretty much what‚Äôs happening right confident get it, asymptomatically spread it, kill harm someone else? Lets forget multiple shootings happen too. Amen. Damn, hell smoking make leap? I'm still sure vit pills thing vit body produces naturally sun foods consumed. interesting deaths causes lowest level 2020 past week. Lower even pre-pandemic levels. usually tied mood disorders eating disorders.

Or, called laziness. Get ass put twinkie Tubbs. imagine many America Restaurants, bars, importantly...""superior"" dickheads *entirely* believe **talk** families dying. why? 

Didn't world-renowned John Ioannidis tell FLu BrO?

/s I'd definitely wear admins would let me. Everything optics hygiene theatre get sued. could care less safety patients staff. wage slave, would've quit long time ago. hate work. surprise. told us wanted testing down.

Numbers go down, preach everything ok need open fully. bullshit make trump look good.

Im tired shit show. ended day multiple occasions headache listen speak can't help yell roll eyes mean come least 6 month jail shit like this. people never learn you/the Gov. act hard can. virus scare jsil 6 month probably came airplane. Yeah. want decency world mean people worry surveillance carry around gps enabled hard drive post social media? people want anonymity mean really dont want internet fame? Great video confirming effectiveness RLF-100 / Aviptadil Dr. Javitt. Well worth time watching video...I bullish RLFTF result. safer way. makes plan worst. way worst starts unfolding, better off. I'm also curious.  much knowledge smart speculation.

Many predictions come true far mine:

I think fast take virus. pharma companies competing cut every legal shortcut get ""consumers"".

I think also see vaccine certificate required many activities. countries going flat require (possibly even force pay immediate vaccination it).

All nations failed near-eradicate virus. suddenly going ability it. Every government want open economy max know can't happen without mass vaccination.

So gonna happen quickly! absolutely criminal! interesting fact. Overall deaths, C-19 deaths past week lowest 2020. Including pre-pandemic counts. friend prison, said absolute clusterfuck. first hit, prison administrators moved slowly separate infected inmates, really systematic approach testing. order make room quarantined inmates, moved (ostensibly) uninfected inmates separate area - something like 90 guys area designed hold 30, made impossible sort social distancing. learned tests mixed - uninfected people quarantine area, infected people 'clean' area. Everybody got sick, they'd stopped testing official stats. want nations responsible actions?
You American conclude. provide link evidence, genuinely curious see first thought wearing diaper. refresh memory? know it‚Äôs months remember saying intents purposes, masks nothing don‚Äôt bother buying wearing them. According Google, Georgia 1.7 million students 2019. I've seen .5% death rate 5-17 year olds studies.

That's 1700 kids dying infected everyone .1% rate. rate higher, there's factors like obesity Georgia, may more. get gas, make sure sunny day goto pump sun burning way pessimistic. long think many unwashed people sat sofa weekend/month/year ""cleanings"" comment implies terminal illness comment post history contrary comment. Another wave three we'll hit ,2000,000 easily. Actually, I'll predict 4,500,000 said done, pushing time domain 3 years assuming 1.5% death rate significanly effective treatment vaccine, although I'm hoping both. Yes, large portion population incapable seeing anything beyond immediate surroundings. surprising, really. shit... I'm still convinced. What's wrong face? still breathe occlude valve tape? yes, that. possible one off. would EVERYWHERE.

Also, meat processing plants. Workers plants getting sick thousands (it's given get hundreds hard labor closed, refrigerated environment), think I've seen reports contamination meat.

China finding traces virus salmon chicken, I've seen lately articles citing airborne transmission main vector. week week fewest people overall died 2020. includes covid-19 hit. salutatorian! powerful combo transcript. surgeries woke general anesthesia. One wisdom tooth extraction (I remember dental students gathered round watch freaking out, went again). fairly invasive chest surgery near throat. know going around neck started asking questions, completely lucid. heard doctor answer someone must released good shit drip immediately went again. resist reaching peanuts?! It‚Äôs coronavirus. Many variants common cold also corona viruses. hypothesis variant common cold similar enough gives partial near total immunity coronavirus. Except lot people deficient so... happened Spanish flu well. Google Dining way less food way going out. yah it‚Äôs odd wouldn‚Äôt craving something can‚Äôt make haha face shields petty boss let us wear them. admins job scummy. wish could sue them. Exactly! can't remember last movie saw theaters. nice TV surround sound less $1000. missing on? Loud karens, crying babies, people phone, people putting feet disgusting, never cleaned chair, price gouging popcorn watered soda, missing move pee, people coming later disturbing you. 

Theaters people ruined theaters, covid. someone hit 5 months ongoing (and still frequently debilitating) symptoms...

You fucking clue talking :)

Please try souless dum dum rest life. brain heart - use them. That‚Äôs really happened though. Fine me. absolutely **have** degenerates wearing masks, preferable comforting know people much higher risk personality adds absolutely nothing society. demographic deserves culling, them. call Chi-nuh fixing numbers fix ok no, no. amount tests steadily going down. Oh, see upvoted comment sub talking woman died Covid prison? Opium effective sedative rough, understand that's like banning overeating... could make sense also. Yeah thought could avoid adding ""/s"" apparently everything needs footnote can't distinguish earnest ignorance satire. lot people pound Vit way hard. That's lot people are.

Everything bad high dose, even water.

People honestly stupid saying overdose (and need lot vitamin D) self explanatory. read article, arrested booked. instead flight Las Vegas like planned, stuck Los Angeles came Las Vegas going. That's good know. type masks dentists wearing?

If normal masks, would another piece (anecdotal) evidence suggests aerosols major transmission risk. week two without positive cases would agree 100 days long even blip radar unless actually cleared it. Especially everyone returning back normal. Nice, thanks sharing. There's doubt many people seeing long term symptoms. Would love see find completed. People sure tough days... Wait it. safe effective vaccines harder think.  means ""just asking questions sea-lioning style"" claims points STRICTLY attempting sow discord distrust Covid-19 numbers. 


for reason fact refuted points longer engaging discussion continue move goal posts around try claim doctors infallible numbers MUST therefore wrong.

I base decisions around Texas family around excess deaths numbers. Forced parents prove indeed named life insurance beneficiary list, funerals expensive. I'm sure mean April. 

 woman Sweden saying wondering numbers went death toll small people vacation homes summer. High cases April August, would support that, right?

 say anything people vacation summer homes April. saying woman Sweden says people vacation homes now.

What bring April for? people change vote based they're day fucking bizarre me. Trump really done anything new 2015. showed everyone exactly is. shit leadership affecting them, guess? hurting right people? one neck gaiters specific fabric? life. comforts deniers. always say well, person pre-existing conditions, old.

They're feeling swollen nodes. generally harmless natural part healing process. bubonic plague's telltale symptom actually massively swollen lymph nodes, usually groin, things. 

On side note, really cool participating trial. Outside frontline healthcare worker, one best things humanity, hopefully feeling whatever, remember something truly honorable right now. Pulse oximeter seems excessive. recording temperature.

Just check fever going office. worked Publix high school bagger/cashier. I‚Äôd say interactions people fine, always 10% customers really shitty people. would treat like inferior them. 

I good/bad managers, really made hate job awful customers were.

Great thread here: know similar cases too.
My cousin type 1 diabetes wife spent holiday parents. 5 people house got infected return home. 2 days later wife started showing symptoms. 2 days together 7x24 - including sex.
Interestingly wife positive symptoms negative symptoms...
It weird... guess word 0 0 mer banned considered insult. ought use panic-consumed person. Otherwise infer approximate age someone licence plate? 

Could personalized plate, ""WE 30 ISH"" speaking herself.. opinion counts, too, even disagree. ignorant, informed experience, obviously differs yours. People die influenza pneumonia EVERY year. Prior March/April, US least seeing unusually high number influenza/pneumonia deaths, seeing unusually high number deaths overall. last week March weekly deaths pneumonia overall weekly deaths started spiking. spreading US winter, low enough level undetectable background noise data. That‚Äôs federal crime. Big expensive mistake. first world war. much bigger threat time, way people lost. saying virus nothing, definitely saying COVID nothing, time probably bigger problems flu. going say this. could spot that, he'd using eagle eyes inappropriate ways female students years. foolish point view...

There 50 Million spanish speaking people USA. 2nd common language ebay Media gone reporting total daily cases daily deaths damn fast. Exactly, keep reach children. Interesting. definitely reddit 2011 explains I'm hip.

Didn't see social media. Well recall least. mean CA one liberal states US makes sense first social distancing 
I totally agree you. India enough idiots wearing mask wearing properly. worried daily due erratic behavior hose owner son. stay building, roam around wearing masks. stupid argue virus hoax. Difference is, case counts going fizzle well. I'm saying say things ""worse"" 1000 tigers New York March 3 states, 3 New York 600 states, thus care people fate states confined New York, also care states come Election Day thus argument support Electoral College. racial disparities still mystery. Blacks Hispanics hit hard seems mostly due crowded housing, lack healthcare ""essential"" jobs. Higher rates obesity, diabetes extra stress poor.  even accounting rates higher especially blacks. think going see higher rates whites soon.  White middle class healthcare, ability social distance isolate, bigger home able work home protective. lot white folks taking unnecessary risks impacted. false sense security foolish behavior going result massive spike infections. I'm assuming there's security monitoring staff observing reminding bubble financial penalties breaking isolation. really not? *In July 23 email sent Norton Healthcare, obtained Health 202, supplier Hologic blamed shortage directive White House coronavirus task force funnel supplies southern states infections surged ‚Äì assertion task force disputes.*

Mark ~~my~~ 500 million+ people's words. mask gloves considered biohazard waste? ... employers general .... Yes could case. likelihood someone 3 strokes 4 months another fatal stroke would happened without covid. 

Let put way mean sound patronising slightest. someone couple heart attacks told ticking time bomb, chance got tested positive. case (asymptomatic) coronavirus. Recovered without hitch heart attack warned doctors months later, would happy claim corona killed them? Immunity passports generally really bad idea anyways... 

Not divide population actually creates incentive get infected. scares now. imagine deaths would ten times higher *least,* given hospitalization rate Covid. oxygen ventilators, antibiotics, many hospitalized individuals would die home. 

So seeing Covid actually *more* deadly Spanish flu, given CFR still hovers 0.55 modern medicine? Apparently lot debate Spanish Flu numbers range CFR 2.5-10%. 

I read something fascinating terrible, native American villages severely hurt Spanish flu, wiping 80% population towns. thing think urban interconnected communities influenza strains, limited protection virus, giving lower CFR. look places like India SEA can't help wonder outbreaks worse, due crowded living conditions poverty. South America hand taking beating yet areas similar demographic living conditions.

Unfortunately see CFR result places like looking time, since many people world still live 100 years ago. baffling disease. Atlanta resident, stay way fuck  People already denying COVID-19 even happening, let alone forgetting it. studies indicate immunity common cold coronaviruses might induce cross immunity. Perhaps enough fight new virus antibodies COVID19 produced. saying scientists bad statements vague useless, beginning begged us use masks, recommending us use That's smart! worry, people work outbreaks traced back homeless shelters Assuming nothing changes, early spring worse that. Current doublings put approx 70% infected april/may. last doublings really going uncomfortable. Approx doubling time 50 days 5 periods. virus bad people don‚Äôt know unless get q-tip rammed nose.  7 months think something instead pretending gonna disappear. Horrible headline. ‚Äòstudy says,‚Äô ‚Äòscientists say.‚Äô another study comes different conclusion, talking different studies inference scientists changed mind.

Bad actors behavior MUST stopped, that's given, everything said also true. say.

Better? thinking this... pretty sure ridiculous even defend handling pandemic. made worse destroyed infrastructure place handle it. Confident enough risk tolerance. confident enough high risk -- high risk movies anyway. 

If worried, I'd wipe myself.

ü•á Yeah thought thing. 42,000 deaths 3.5m infections ifr 1.2%, 5 times higher CDC estimates US. Inmates routinely transported county jails states.  Happens every day.  USM transportation uncommon. 

In ideal world, inmates work around would protected PPE adequate, accurate testing.  think inmates worthy protection worth spending additional taxpayer funds them. Would agree general feeling majority spending colleges towards salaries people? capped dean president salaries 100k, costs per student would plummet? [I guest network COVID-19 5G Test Tower private network named best little blue box buy made Mexico look list nearly every single product made there. sorry going this. I‚Äôm afraid there‚Äôs way say.

Much depend Fall semester goes, especially schools in-person classes. much depend school located ‚Äî campus countryside, whether city. things state.

Good luck üçÄ It‚Äôs mostly old obese people anyways literally case cardboard cutout Donald Trump would managed effectively actual Donald Trump. Well like say ‚Äú test viruses ‚Äú Let rephrase clarify: would rather live like whole life Covid outbreaks better controlled USA, would rather live like American citizen knowing social setup makes harder contain vital outbreaks occur. 

Their outbreak level USA‚Äôs is. Currently right, idea mutate. total number cases high are, outside realm possibility point. thinking lack hospital support get require care bringing death rate. Probable cause death vs official. everyone 100% determined cause death. put probable cause death. would know pneumonia due covid-19? Since corpses tested postmortem bunch pneumonia like deaths likely due covid aren‚Äôt officially reported way.  Lukashenko tried that, theres revolution. Thank must missed right laid poorly. 6 months behind many developing countries Asia.

Blo√ü eine kleine Korrektur. Im Englischen wird ""Premier"" (in britischen Englischen, z. B. hier Australien) und ""Governor"" (in den USA) verwendet statt ""Prime Minister"". \[Prime Minister ist nur f√ºr das Amt der Exekutive einer parlamentarischen Staat reserviert, genauso wie Kanzler DE &amp; AT\]

Bitte sorge nicht! Es ist ein sehr h√§ufiger Fehler, der deutschsprachige Menschen machen. Im Englischen bedeutet Prime Minister ""Kanzler"" und wenn man Herr S√∂der als ""PM"" nennt, versteht englische Muttersprachler dass der Typ der Kanzler Bayerns ist (als ob es eine unabh√§ngige Staat w√§re) und aufgrund der Tatsache, dass es momentan nur eine sehr kleine bayerische Unabh√§ngigkeitsbewegung gibt, bleibt ein ""PM S√∂der eines unabh√§ngiges Bayerns"" als blo√ü eine komische Idee, [die ned jetzt oder der Zukunft geben wird, wie Bavaria :P

The useful thing know % random sample people currently COVID+ Knowing % people COVID symptoms also COVID+ (and telling 10 days fact) serves purpose. Bill Gates saying weeks.

They're big corporate entity part country, grocery gas chain, heard boss they're hemmorging employees places like Target (I wonder why? /s).

Excuse me, 200 upvotes count post?! like though wealthy people someone life tell lifestyle fundamentally bad society. live life relatively blinded inequity generate. 

From private schools, private neighborhoods, sycophantic posses 'yes' men, therapists provide pills numb whenever existential threat knowing cause societal problems arises, accountants ensure wealth infinite lastly pride telling deserve everything ""job creators."" 

They effectively royalty...and one tells ""King"" behavior moronic dangerous. act aghast suggest problem - one ever told that. told - support systems life style tells opposite suppose do. 

Frankly need representative government need working class representatives. quote: ""risk infection surfaces low"" Could also translated to: ""the risk get toughing surfaces low"". may well case, touch face touching said surface see works you! Yeah right. hope unfortunately people angry can't go store without mask, they're angry wait things take people providing services. Like AOC????? everybody seems like shit really don‚Äôt know cleaning classes solution. airborne, imagine tightly packed hallways etc AC blasting due heatwave ongoing now, circulating air over. read article students complaining lots others wearing masks. go, tightly packed hallways classrooms, recirculated air, masks.

Explain kid. working retail right now, experience retail back day 95-99% customers good great. get really nice, transaction - noteworthy, exchange pleasantries exchange goods services money. 

But ***ONE FUCKER*** thinks they're center goddamn universe makes want blind hand scanner beat grocery divider. I've gotta imagine self centered idiots probably likely average nice normal customer hiding virus much possible. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Ah yes, remember ""Covid real, laying doctors/nurses?"" people.

Of course temporarily doctors nurses work non-essential/purely cosmetic procedures stop working. non-essential/purely cosmetic procedures.

I'm sure people believed lie also somehow believing ""oh no, make money labeling everything Covid that's they're working around clock label everything Covid. one's laid off, rake MUH TAX DOLLARS!""

Lies contradictory? matter. worse Lou Holtz comparing playing college football storming Normandy Beach. don‚Äôt even understand two things even remotely comparable.

Lets start over, beginning DG. Ok show propaganda working well West. 

We information vaccine too. 

We created vaccine ahead you, want admit it. remember reading resilience Type-O blood also.

Most people still think COVID-19 Respiratory illness understand seems things does, remember reading actually classifying something infects circulatory system, explains manifestation different parts body different symptoms (and would perhaps also explain Blood type might impact). study possible? thought weeks cant detect antibodies anymore??? Yeah ! doctor said sunbelt highest levels vitamin deficiency. Including myself. genuinely shocked , I‚Äôm outside quite bit , nearly always covered. vitamin pills get levels back up. don‚Äôt think people realize important immune system. vague awareness nah, that's ignited it. let's forget Austria occupied country archduke murdered. bosnia really german speaking country u know so... even Yeah, students bin Laden comparison. solve problem washing cold goods, leaving literally everything else box week.

Not getting fun packages (usually board games) week kind drag. far groceries though, months worth stocked up, keep box rotating in, really extra work first week started. call Covie Corral may laugh keep crying.

I'm certain people think I'm crazy it, I'm damned idiot. I'm worried corn can, I'm worried goon grocery. Hot breathing pack tortillas, fingering potatoes, sneezing hot sauce. risk it? dump box delivery gets put corner.

I aim 110% diligence CMA 5% lax. ü§ú Reminds myself, teenager, thought everything figured out. Hopefully America going phase. probably don‚Äôt source that. It‚Äôs impossible tell right many people permanent damage since can‚Äôt really research long term outcomes. article NewScientist seems indicate 20% patients made icu scarring lungs months treatment. ‚Äú50% coming long term complications‚Äù isn‚Äôt grounded scientific fact. Understand personally I'd go better late never here.
  
 
Positivity rate measure well regards slowing spread virus. measure well understanding scope problem.
   
   
With 19% positivity rate say certainty testing enough scope problem community unknown. 
  
  
With 2% positivity rate test results coming month test, say certainty know scope problem total testing numbers good. 
    
  
Obviously neither scenarios help much respect giving people actionable info need stop spread, 19% flying completely blind potentially multiple problems fix beyond speeding test processing. I've never worked grocery store. customers make life tiny bit less trash them? Wow impressive! think life call option happiness days spent ""out money"" worth zero less zero

The rest world never-ending sword damocles virus continually shut whenever pops up; see Australia NZ now. Except Sweden right way done. Yeah, can‚Äôt get drunk drinking soapy water.

Reddit feedback? 

Are crazy!

Me: folks getting better. It‚Äôs getting worse. Everyday. See end sight. 

Solution: know do. argue SARS-COV-2 dangerous Spanish Flu, since we're getting 2% death rate *because* tools 1918, e.g., basic oxygen support antibiotics secondary infections, never mind advanced tools like ICU care, anticoagulants, dialysis machines, antivirals, dexomethosone, monoclonal antibodies, genetically engineered vaccines, etc.

What would death rate take away? 1918 medical care basically ""you get better die"", SARS-COV-2 within spitting distance 1918 death rate, apparently far infectious. Unfortunately people qualified answer question live future reddit today. Ya know both, right? I'll take things heard $1000 Alex

I wish sister best! i'm east coast, we're less progressive unfortunately. I'll see what's needed. I'm hoping I've enough psych appointments starting transition past 5 years cove already we'll see suppose. 

Thanks info! lots articles potential long term effects studies still ongoing. 6 months really enough time know statistics even long term effects could be. know inflammation heart lead issues, know lung damage cause long term issues, believe chronic fatigue could table. personal example irks me. Bigger companies bailed aren‚Äôt paying large/mid-sized companies aren‚Äôt paying really small business. Propping airlines Boeing help mom pop machining company made parts waiting 180 days told Boeing likely returning parts.  It‚Äôs fucking shit show. heads up, agreeing :) haha

It's mysterious everyone pretends. act like first time ever seen health crisis Facebook real. haha!

This virus may symptoms lot people (a majority even) already know are. knew early March. actually know virus works general level. know goes immune system first confuse make literally attack itself. focuses lungs respiratory system. 

So sure, need study decade learn does, came from, mutate small degrees, best way eliminate keep bay, more... really know bad. People need stop acting like jury still out. 

And things people things know lot already. know sure immune system compromised puts high risk lots things damaged time takes recover. older already compromised takes longer recover get damaged completely easier. causes pneumonia already know often carries lingering breathing side effects more. damages lungs also know sometimes irreparable lasting effects (think preaching hear cigarettes). 

The article question misleading clearly clickbait, love. Probably COVID-19 asymptomatic (your body effectively let in) 50% likely long term major effects nowhere. need ""wait"" learn happening front eyes. need wait right article across feed know either. No. Even happened, see sudden random 10% drop week before. way significant drop. someone vaccine-literate help explain RNA tech? true taking type vaccine means cannot reactivate later cleared - due fact injected virus, rather like digital/RNA data/fingerprint makes immune identity virus? agree sick f*cks, surely pay taxes average American does. FUCK WRONG AMERICA!?? love drawing conclusions blatantly incomplete data making decisive conclusions it. 

!remindme 8 weeks caps really helped come phone screen. lieu Tony, please take award.

""Yankee"" states strong sense civic duty, voter turnout higher states. There's streak settlement Appalachians leads central Texas, strong sense individualism personal responsibility comes (both pioneering ""Build future"" sense ""Not problem, adult, take care self"" sense), Deep South extending Houston distinct roots.

It really looks concept ""American"" attitudes kind defies red/blue black-and-white line people try draw ""cities"" ""country"" residents, *a* factor people vote, there's much difference someone New York City votes vs someone Seattle someone Austin someone Ledbetter. 

Definitely southern states faith-based, individualist bent meshed well safety precautions middle pandemic, regardless city dwelling vs country dwelling. done nothing ~~options~~ ideas. Right, that's percentage deaths, talking percentage total deaths different number.

But used. 1% specifically objection. Even lower, low estimate.

The point remains, thousand dead kids Georgia low estimate. I'll put house arrest I've area Normandy 1 case last month. I'll arrive UK 12 hours rules kick in. I'll miss brothers wedding 2 weeks work. hell test people? can'y pop get test somewhere merry way? insane me. highly doubt number jumped 300k 3.4m. similar BS NYC also remains unsubstantiated consistent deflection muddying - good job! would take essay untangle everything wrong one comment. show allegiance Trumpdaddy. Meanwhile classes start next week haven‚Äôt decided they‚Äôre opening Man would bring kid back school. superintendent principal making clear politics important kids. scientists sentenced least 100,000 Americans covid death.(completely ethics) Fuck Congress letting us volunteers take vaccine get live sars shot right ass. prove vaccine works not. afraid death, afraid vaccine. sure hell afraid people think critical thinking. clearly aren‚Äôt paying attention. HEROES Act passed Dem-led House back mid May. GOP-led Senate didn‚Äôt even start talking end last July.

To day GOP trying use excuse gut Social Security (payroll tax) and/or reduce UI payements $600 $200. that‚Äôs start bullshit. Hell, recent GOP suing Atlanta prevent instituting mask mandate.

But keep going ‚Äúlol sides‚Äù cynicism. clearly fucking stop look around second. One example USA doomed. Start learning Russian Mandarin. Oops, would require education system. Sorry. two party system please die now?

Edit: imagine defending two party system don‚Äôt like someone LOL  real horror set 20 years exhibiting early onset Alzheimer‚Äôs Parkinson‚Äôs disease. national tragedy. saw someone say hydrochlooquine would work Covid, doesn‚Äôt make much profit vaccines. aren‚Äôt using it. mean depends definition covid, locked covid could argue effects lockdown effects covid, could say literally infected want us riot again? Yeah, contact trace, one else quarantine except positive test. fact GOP wants kind protection employees suing COVID issues needs said. allows corporations ignore pandemic force employees death sentences mere profit. It‚Äôs extremely disgusting Dems said they‚Äôll never agree something like that. would wreak havoc long term stimulus package would afford people. Considering supporters generally at-risk categories, hurt him.  I'm going show people want see. I'm going show world without you. world without rules controls, without borders boundaries. world anything possible. go choice leave you.. quorum (51 senators). think gap years common US. clue wanted graduated high school. cases translated inyo deaths.

But guess suspicions true - would never change mind, matter what. Fauci isn‚Äôt dr either. Even extremely germaphobic friends happen politically liberal still can‚Äôt acknowledge around half infected people asymptomatic.

‚ÄúOh definitely don‚Äôt it‚Äù say despite tested. It‚Äôs politics education level even intelligence play here. guess, I‚Äôd say combination fear denial, they‚Äôre afraid know they‚Äôre infected plus overly confident ability stay healthy. It‚Äôs honestly baffling. Mass grave swamps?

2021 headline: ""Florida alligator population exploded gained taste human flesh"" Whatever, comrade. day coming we‚Äôre going get payback. Know that. little old getting fist fights? üíØ It‚Äôs ‚Äúsomehow‚Äù. Democrats largely based policies beliefs science.

For last decades, Republicans painted Democrats evil devils always wrong everything, matter what.

I'm librarian. time quarantine books 4 days treat surfaces contaminated. much, wash hands responsible safety. public spaces handled way well. Considering everything contaminated avoid risk possible.  illegal Germany, people want it. Yea believe Fauci says mid late 2021 universal US vaccination. Well, understanding Senate recess use time vacations, also tend use spend significant time actual states, visit constituents, whatnot... Though I'm sure many town halls going held pandemic...

I believe summer recess something Senate every year, unless war... sounds like also need ""national health crisis"" rule added that. problem lot people supposed staying home, aren‚Äôt staying home. Staying home also put older family members risk. So, *that's* Devil went Georgia! Well done. Close em down.  worthless assholes. yikes...that's shady stuff read Facebook A-L Here's quick rule thumb - gathering something agree spread virus way shape form. something agree basically throwing gasoline soaked dynamite fire everyone going die. Positive hell gonna go see? Smart. Yep gets crazy actually take look idiots actually stand for. Example: Noted racist Strom Thurmond served senate **48 years**. replaced noted waste space Lindsey Graham held seat 18 years. democrats aren‚Äôt much better matter. truly one ‚Äúon sides‚Äù issues.  problem. I'm trying point issue clearly people eating drinking closed spaces. Obviously anything naturally involves people close proximity shut down.  That‚Äôs woman? Also running around panties. Classic police correctional officers died covid 2020 causes combined [Saint That‚Äôs held next relief bill. Republicans demanding remove legal liability employers kill workers schools kill students. officials frantically trying trace origin Covid-19 cluster Auckland, could come University Professor Sir David Skegg told Morning Report reports show 60 percent staff working border never really shocked hear Director-General Health say week two ago aiming test people [border workers] every two three weeks, every two three weeks frankly would quite turns nothing like achieved see reports 60 percent people working border never tested.""

What joke.  literally click unweighted data see week clears excess death threshold. gonna spout data least learn read it. According CDC 40% infections asymptomatic. That's functionally thing immunity save fact might still transmit it. Fuckin assholes It‚Äôs hilarious they‚Äôre downvoting clarifying misleading article. countries tested lot per death basis

Log scale easily see country names Yes even though threshold, still, lowest amount whole year, including pre-pandemic weekly counts. 3.4 - 7.2 percent excess. compare 2018 Jan flu season 9.3-13.4. Okay, say someone baby who's grown EXTREMELY active toddler months since March miss play centres fiery passion. 

But case numbers start rise alarmingly seem like ideal time open bunch new things. üò¨  Mine tried well. sell video games. fuckfaces confined senate enough time food medically approved sleep schedules get something done. basic/core problem arrogant people inability trust/respect scientific authority.

When literally ENTIRE medical community comes makes dire predictions number deaths TRUST THEM!

I mean **Steve Jobs** went specialist EXPERT field told way could live got invasive surgical procedure.

Steve said ""nah, I'll cure fruit diet""...

Steve Jobs dummy. happen Steve Jobs happen Bubba Geogia. people mistakenly believe virus respect joke ass loser trash political beliefs. shit!? would've thought?? /s see packed patios Austin, people sitting close together eating drinking. outside mean safe getting sick. 1500 deaths times 166 infected per death = 249,000 infected one fucking day. Ok folks bad news. numbers high enough cost child life every 4-5 days. Maybe worse. 1 460k children infected dies small data set, 5 children. could way worse easily within margin error. congregation following precautions secretary stated article. one wearing mask indoors, conducting temp screenings door, maintaining social distances. Many people attendance coughing visibly sick! make matters worse, congregation increased significantly community churches closed doors congregants attending church. several friends family attend services there. many traced riots ?? Good you, Alabamians! Keep up! Public Health experts say everyone observing guidelines ‚Äî distancing, masks, outside inside, hygiene, etc. ‚Äî enough keep virus manageable levels üëç Haha what? sub getting ridiculous. source claim? Oh yeah! That's mosh pits could lead severe injuries. sold soul Satan, Satan got good look it, cancelled deal comment ""LOL look thing! even want free!""  Great. creates incentive people stay home would awesome.  true. Sometimes can't anything situation that's that. People hate powerless hate even admit it. life that's often are. often third parties involved. admit reality situation. Anything else outside beyond control give airtime pushes blood pressure up. never screamed employee know people it. people face kind repercussions church? lot people, including myself, work go school. don‚Äôt go uni improve either. free online course. Read books. Practice something useful. Learn language. tons ways expand competences. Complaining however isn‚Äôt one them. literally information even comprehend tip fingers 24/7. improving you. Yeah Luftansa warned thing weeks back, offered mask upon seating, show ffp3 filter under, ok.  German study showed people quarantined sick loved one caught virus 75% time 20% time seperated upon symptoms onset. sample size way small draw valid conclusions still interesting. Table 3 will. god help us even lower cut elderly.

I think someone 30s like 0.30%  anyone wondering America badly affected wants take ‚ÄúAmericans stupid selfish‚Äù hypothesis. Consider structural issues like weak paid sick leave laws for-profit medical system. 

Having lived place including America, tell stupid selfish American trope doesn‚Äôt track first hand experience. right honestly think changes much, numbers still terrible. 

In fact thing seems done embolden deniers bit more. Expendables. seeing reports 'victims' yours? Use brain. potentially misleading make blanked statements IFR based English figures. significantly worse outbreaks care homes, people obviously likely suffer severe symptoms. also higher levels infection among poor people (who likely pre-existing conditions). likely deaths would far lower virus affected people equally across population.

Additionally, deaths based UK total rather England, antibody studies suggest number infected England might actually lot higher 6%. Possibly close 8%. Masks hallways class back asswards. Class features far extended close contact hallways classes. never saw humans.

Get back work, capital stock! fatality around 0.6%. Antibody test inaccurate. sure reddit keeps this. make fresh ingredients ice cream salt. Look ‚Äúice cream bag‚Äù recipes.  could probably glue shut. think putting fabric outside exhaust valve would smarter tho. Exhaling thru filters make filters go bad quicker. Humidity destroys canisters quickly. Chin up, we're fairly well. There's science leading charge. stupidity issues like edmontons temporary 'mask exemption' handouts give worry that's expected Alberta. Sounds terrible. public failure first response thought they'd EU countries would do. know never used Europe USA even work thanks public detractors PRC food import dependent. Seems like prepare problems intl trade. November going start real situation. going lead December January that's going make 2020 look like Fortnite game. Ok. Yeah honestly, think US kinda viable options really. better hope vaccines good news. like 3 months ago healthcare heroes. repay us taking care patients. That's fucked, I'm sorry. EMTs definitely need PPE, pandemic not. 1/2 9-11 per day. Note Scotland already using way counting deaths England changed to.

This actually nefarious change... Everyone keeps referring us essential treating us expendable. miss something definitions get swapped along way? 2 weeks long enough, need least 6 weeks get virus manageable level. that's hard, nobody (except essential people) go anywhere lockdown. know damn well drops used propaganda push reopenings despite exact thing happening May-June. It‚Äôs even happening sub. Winter disaster. Nahh. would imply competence least one field. Unfortunately, India many good solutions. Another lockdown destroy many millions lives economy tank. reopening like account many infections densely populated country Bolsonaro family dinners bit tense future... hard think get education managing survive? lot us either work go school. without money job, last long schooling option. I'm sorry that's happened you. Sincerely wish best quick recovery! there's anything else missing drive thru please let us know! super reported interaction needs attention. mean, what's psychological effect infecting possibly killing people love? 

This solitary confinement. People taken care checked upon multiple times day many people including experts service people. still full access internet, phone, TV, deliveries. bills paid govt. 

Which alternative choose? psychological effect psychological effect first sentence? Time tell. Schools one thing think about, seems like went close precautions approach places, hunch places already robust levels immunity like NYC won‚Äôt see surges anywhere like first surge. question many areas robust immunity. never said did. Weather effect human behavior, therefore changing nature opportunities viral transmission. Hey, EU always looking talent likeminded people. Maybe look get information get started. Ah, old ‚Äútaste medicine‚Äù rule  problem, use quick home COVID19 test kits everyone has... know asymptomatic comes without symptoms.  Test accuracy: peak day infectiousness, people infect dozens, peak short window. See depends type mask. Welp, that's another company boycott. Maybe comment may sound optimistic subreeddit like kind attitude. sure Boris Johnson use dark magic resurrect 5000 them? lab studies animals cells promising. Hopefully also effective actual human use reduce cytokine storms Dude, also need paid more. Nurses better pay right now, education responsibilities, doctors aids/techs...but that's like saying best apartment Mogadishu. Nursing still pay well putting with. One hit wonders.

If die attending smash mouth gig get COVID , people right mock you. Salty Americans talking supposed Chinese genocide lands Natives literally genocided. Good. us same. 30% would highest history Yeah, things listed loonstrook, live salary, that‚Äôs really issue. It‚Äôs I‚Äôm treated considering quitting. probably are. summarized Sweden come top regarding total effects. Counting deaths kinda pointless, need count lost years, preferably QALY, quality adjusted life years. 80+ bad health condition, it‚Äôs prolonging life long possible, quality life time left. Lol, nothing it. Fauci said vacciones COULD offer full protection (vaccines often offer it). initial results phase 3 trials, better worse.

ATM know work (unprobable) work 100% cases (very unprobable). cool thing WNBA exactly pandemic - audience.  ever treated human, govt job grocery store workers. Even us medical field feel way sucks. ELI5 me? look tool, enter group size 50 tells probablity least one would positive area. Texas learning hard way ""Don't mess Covid-19"" y'all . #masks4all numbers confuse comparing value? site seems pretty good data. Maybe best individual countries average seem pretty good.

One thing obvious. Sweden continued operate normal. Ok, supply chains got cut off, tourists stayed away, health system continued operate normal. collateral damage expected. England published recently first data collateral damage. every three Corona victims, two deaths caused lock-down. moment collateral damage reaches Corona damage, lock-down becomes pointless, moment collateral damage overtakes, lock-down became damaging country.  mom always really passive aggressive nicest towards retail restaurant employees.

PFFHHHLLLLPPLLPLFLFFH Seriously. brothers girl tells little cousin kids can‚Äôt get infected; he‚Äôs 7. knows better. 7yo cousin called bs basically. Stupid cunt. would tell child anyway?! see linked one highest weekends, average. Ah, cherry picking stats.

You also know shootings happen very, specific places. US perfectly safe.

Finally, fuck hate US? Either move Europe, go fuck bed stay arguing stranger. September look forward that! agree feel kids. However, system setup massive number people repeat grades fall teachers future years catch kids up. news mentioned aint qualified take it. theatrics. made tons fake shit like reality wont it. Simply, no. Again, obvious answer keep fucking job, may well necessary continue supporting said old person.

I'm trying imagine level denialism necessary look situation USA re: virus, look rest civilized world, say ""Yep. problem here, obviously, they're DAMN STRICT America."" days rest us heathens looking lot less evil men cloth, that's none business. Yeah covers tuition, room &amp; board, etc. leave middle semester reason. They‚Äôre keeping refund policy place refunds certain percentage first week weeks drop you‚Äôre still hook tuition. Instead fixing fucked system came idea charge students protected it. It‚Äôs insane. feel bad parents.

The vast majority parents school aged children risk. small minority keep children home.

For supposed teacher, completely lack common sense. Yes, proper cults have, Europe still pockets ""radical"" (for lack better word) Christianity, hopefully stay partly insignificant. think bar set pretty low. asking I‚Äôm doing, respond ‚Äúgood, you?‚Äù seem surprised would actually ask them... that‚Äôs started clueing they‚Äôre treated well. That's point. fact inconvenience back shit comes mouth. Double checked second source (worldometers). It‚Äôs typo. 

But soon people tell ‚Äúthey didn‚Äôt die covid, died covid‚Äù. Cool story, bro. Hope great night! No, probably unachievable coronavirus - meaningful part population lifelong immune - capable spreading via microdroplet / aerosol. papaya, I'll take goat fever 100.....fucking great.

Also, love idea violent worst criminals (rapists murderers) completely broken point ‚Äúmasculinity‚Äù completely gone (focusing males, could work females course) emotion left fear, no, complete terror. Unable harm anyone else, completely traumatized, psychological hell, throw throw super terrible violent inmates. 

I‚Äôm sick bastard like that, probably years abused.

Inmates think get away ‚Äúasserting dominance‚Äù ‚Äúalpha males‚Äù, I‚Äôd love see broken point laying ground fetal position, crying, experiencing nothing pure psychological torture terror, inmates approach rape beat shit (because that‚Äôs did).

ON HAND, inmates AWFUL, MAY actually deserve get asses beat then, dominated. Like child rapists, rapists general, murderers, especially made victim suffer slowly painfully.

On real note, prison REHABILITATION punishment.

All taxdollars going spent rehabilitating inmates return society. Even way bad ever released, least give meaningful productive life prison.

Spending taxdollars simply keeping people locked life chance life, complete waste taxpayers dollars. 

There homeless people aren‚Äôt even criminals could helped taxfunded rehabilitation well, wasting money keeping criminals locked YEARS REST LIVES.

The US TERRIBLE prioritizing taxdollars go, many people boner PUNISHMENT.

Millions inmates reoffend release well, system BROKEN! youngest oldest tend best. There's something middle age makes people bitter. guess probably menopause husband ED.

Florida chuchman goes breaking bad got treated like humans first place? wasnt treated like human covid let alone now... Nope, central air. separate ventilation system in-unit open windows time. Though, unit door sealed shut I'm sure system draws little air hallway cracks. Didn‚Äôt republicans give trillion dollars billionaire friends already? die get tuition back? :P Jokes aside I'm curious structured. TLDR: 11 new imported cases, 8 new domestic case, 15 new imported asymptomatic carriers, 5 new domestic asymptomatic carriers

In case, think actions represent (going beach etc.) rational, mathematical approach virus, there's 99.5% survival rate. ie. 1/200 chance dying. staying home year two, that's probably like 1/20th remaining life (for sure) throwing away fear.

Since young, chance dying actually much lower, math even obvious irrational fear cowardly self-defeating. 

Plus ""American Empire"" going crippled missing people can't even survive virus 99.5% survival rate?

It's like vaccine come next year we're done. took 37 years release first Measles vaccine disease considered eliminated. Great post. don‚Äôt love Chinese government reasons unrelated pandemic (like lack free press), shouldn‚Äôt let racism prejudice get way fact China one best pandemic responses anywhere. Much this, course, comes cooperation commitment Chinese people. initial punishments whistleblowers wrong course, presumably actions officials occurred seriousness situation known. 

I‚Äôll add Chinese scientists also ones pushed idea virus could spread symptom onset, many US scientists repeatedly dismissed idea different SARS MERS. countries accepted idea could greatly improved global response start, encouraging general public wear dropped though. remember? testing means cases. test less, fewer cases. 

... feel like lost intelligence writing out. true it‚Äôs inhumane I‚Äôm surprised I‚Äôm hearing SMH people too. glady bring home get forsaken hell hole covid trapped in. mean anything, believe comment CDC made towards end July. I'll try find article quotes it.

TBH, literally would believe there's coronavirus it, name tracks. profit healthcare.

It would interesting people tested positive symptoms tested positive months later.  unfortunately necessary logicians like you

The condescension intentional opinions wrong, stupid, dangerous. better this. Another piece shit rule.

These idiots, idiocy laws added adjusted allow immediate removal bat shit crazy idiots like one oval office. Half country: ""MISSION ACCOMPLISHED YEE HAWWWWWWW"" proven work technically. seems obvious. also know first hand encourages people ignore effective guidelines, possibly making mandates counterproductive.

But haven‚Äôt seen anything correlations suggest mandates reduce spread. 90k without changes, obviously demonstrated major shifts people interacting. forget ultraviolet light innards hope airlines permanently ban flights. That's exactly said Ty!! seem know you‚Äôre talking ‚Äî moderna vaccine cause armpit swelling? Really random I‚Äôve see phase 3 trial people complain side effect.

Still woke breathing tube throat. doctors confused. back surgery. really need get better testing we're going make significant progress United States. attempted schedule test last Thursday (the 6th), told first available testing yesterday (the 12th) got tested yesterday told could another 5 days get result (as late 17th). people window 10-12 days they're infectious. I'm going spending virtually entire time waiting test result. That's fairly useless slowing spread virus. Viral load, much taking time makes big difference. didn‚Äôt symptoms took shit helped? WTF Trump criticize Biden every step way.

Former presidents rarely criticize successors class that. WTF?  live Delaware. get tested weekly, want know ASAP get it.

1. free. even submit insurance paperwork. 
2. easy -- drive testing little wait (with onlne reservation)
3. symptoms required

Lol. changed afterward didn‚Äôt want waste cops‚Äô time.

I said ‚Äúcome on.... they‚Äôre jehovas witnesses...‚Äù might care gene expression leads hair color. People gene red hair higher pain tolerance average resistant anesthesia (i.e. need knock out). course, assumes COVID-19 effects depend genetics.

For redheaded gene stuff Google search ""Mythbusters redhead episode"". interesting watch. Day Walker Thanks. 
I really sum to, fact people (as right now) seen someone die this, suffer major symptoms. far they're concerned, abstract wars occurring far away countries. Says China  I‚Äôd like know answer completely. People suppressed immune systems may robust enough reactions vaccines effective. autoimmune diseases take chemo drugs daily. gotten multiple things vaccinated like chicken pox mumps. goes older individuals, may work quite well. rely herd immunity. aren‚Äôt exposed effective vaccine becomes pointless pulled CDC data Excel directly compare dates, compared data Worldometer dates.

 May dates may 3-30, worldometer 2784, CDC 2556 attributed Covid, 3117 excess deaths average causes. Pretty close right?

In June 1-27, Covid deaths worldometer:1040, CDC: 894, overall excess deaths 1781. Okay, starting see 80-100% excess deaths. 

June 28-aug 1: covid deaths worldometer: 689, CDC:655, overall excess deaths 3884! 

Overall, CDC 7971 covid deaths, Worldometer 7289 reported period, obviously mismatch date deaths reported. biggest difference deaths attributed Covid 1077 higher May CDC compared Worldometer, presumeably CDC accurate dates actual mortality compared publically reported 

Btw, total excess deaths overall Aug 1 13343. Oh shit tought attacked employee. Since two sentences contradict other, /s assumed apply second sentence. Hell, I'm still dumb get trying say. Yeah :)  42% US population Vitamin deficient. even know it. get mine checked every year even standard doctors check. be!! People ageist. 

Unlike current pandemic, Spanish Flu discriminate. people ages *may* die coronavirus, everyone age 60 less 1% chance becoming fatality. ages 20 30, instance, case-fatality rate--as estimated Centers Disease Control Prevention--is 0.03%. 

I stating facts dissuade anyone COVID's lethality. advocate wearing masks whenever public, well laws mandating use masks whenever public. 

However, Spanish Flu--so far recall--was disproportionately *more* likely kill young middle-aged elderly. killed children, killed young adults, killed working professionals. 

While COVID-19 that, too, lethal Spanish Flu respect older adults pre-existing health conditions, elderly. Thanks Obama 


/s I‚Äôm pretty sure aren‚Äôt using saline injection placebos reason. think they‚Äôve using stuff like meningitis vaccine instead. tells shared juul friend fever spending weekend together wonder people catch it?

...that's exactly point. worst thing do, prettymuch gauranteed transmit virus, get it. exemption all. order website anywhere. I've checked. know got that√± everything else quotes order. Okay, gotta ask, post translation Flying Spaghetti Monster Swedish, pronunciation? MUST KNOW! least controlled experement point at, reopen schools. That's legit thing. Air purifiers made countries can't handle air China - they're heavy duty enough.

Of course China realise problem trying fix root too. manager audacity tell stocking shelves half rate new employee even though I'm one constantly getting pulled aside odd jobs. entirely relevant, needed vent. short time people treated us nice COVID wild. didn‚Äôt know respond people said nice things.

I'm seeing [these stage fogger touted Sanitizing devices. come instruction mix water sanitizer liquid 1:1 ratio.

&amp;#x200B;

Not true. mask pretty annoying, wearing it, still leave house without one go back get it. little inconvenient oh well. I‚Äôll glad aren‚Äôt mandatory anymore simple fact point, pandemic passed. flip side, think I‚Äôm going continue wear one winter season especially since get subway every day. plenty could have, still doing, won‚Äôt list here. Instead, maybe research ponder obvious simple measures POTUS could/should taking. Well he's correct. Bleach kill virus. consequence kill hey. get wings Buffalo. Also - bleu cheese cures Covid taken inside body. 

Anybody asks ranch paid George Soros. try keeo dirty pocket clean pocket. It'a hard right.

Used work sterile labs. much harder work like put there. So, wife hanging while? Without mask? Realistically, seems unlikely would it, simply person B would 1) 2) enough viral load pass A. Even would long enough spread. wife would need get it... long enough give you. got don‚Äôt necessarily get it...I would suggest limit exposure others, wear mask, wash hands. See person B it. Person get tested. washing hands touching raw meat generally. open wounds, wear gloves. Irish born former Irish prime minister Irish? Probably biggest thing nipping Republicans heels get deal passed already. could also they‚Äôre entrenched matter. issue places like Cleveland Clinic finding even gimmie control cases know person COVID standard testing, antibody tests can't get.

The Clinic told father weeks ago they're flat useless everyone using basically wasting time money right base on? don‚Äôt need degree every better paying profession store clerk. show competences you‚Äôre fine lot them. What‚Äôs negative mindset. It‚Äôs almost like don‚Äôt even want try get somewhere life. don‚Äôt trust make list things CDC got right, make another list things CDC got wrong. look situation US, list think would longer?  fact people a) don‚Äôt care b) can‚Äôt see preventable is/was c) selfish d) don‚Äôt realize bad compared countries 
It‚Äôs fucking mind blowing opposite side defined population supporting universal basic income. That‚Äôs ridiculous. anyone basic understanding economics see won‚Äôt work. It‚Äôs people oppose progressive policies. People oppose dumb ideas cause everyone quit jobs stay home country goes bankrupt. ‚ÄúWho could predicted this!??‚Äù unemployment massively increasing due COVID-19, absolutely difficult. still cook Dude, using reasoned arguments ""I'm covered blood Jesus"" futile. Maybe worry diet weight instead. fooling anyone loose baggy suits. Retail general brings trash people. COVID people treat people like aren‚Äôt human.  scare me. social distancing? class set keep kids apart? add kids classes, unless setting room sort built in. 1.7% Irish population speak Gaelic daily. definitely majority English speaking country. 

Think situation similar Canada/Quebec. lots people speak Gaelic, officially bilingual country alternate signs passports stuff, vast majority day day stuff done English. Ah yes, glaring simple answer everyone‚Äôs dumb corrupt see. psychology called ‚Äúblack white thinking‚Äù...in reality...

An economy like USA‚Äôs (still economic superpower world btw), can‚Äôt ‚Äújust 100% lockdown.‚Äù

It‚Äôs possible. Nurses gotta work, doctors gotta work, prison guards, cops, firemen, grocery stores, farmers, guy fixes farmers tractor, plumbers, list 5 pages long. 

Now, mature enough acknowledge 100% shutdown isn‚Äôt thing...we realize there‚Äôs going degree spread. also acknowledge there‚Äôs thing danger/death/lack quality life massive economic disaster. 

Let numbers determine degree openness. smart policy always. Don‚Äôt overwhelm healthcare system. it‚Äôs insane pretend doesn‚Äôt exist wear masks. It‚Äôs also insane think ever ‚Äú100% shutdown.‚Äù

I‚Äôm attacked left right basically saying...

‚ÄúWe recognize there‚Äôs going positive negative effects multiple variables. situation sucks extreme-ism namecalling wont get us anywhere. need plan prioritizes public health. also acknowledges everyone sitting home government printing Monopoly money wiping asses $50 bills viable strategy.‚Äù I'm math right...

For Week 29, week July, recent week say 100% processed, recorded 4,671 pneumonia deaths.

The units ""percent deaths"" numbers really inconvenient work with... 

There 51,562 total deaths US week, pneumonia 9.06% deaths.

Their threshold 5.6% week. threshold thick black wave right-hand graph. see 2017-2018 flu season also high threshold.

5.6% 51,562 would 2,887.

So unprecedented, interesting __1,784 pneumonia deaths usual week. (254.9 per day)__

The actual flu killing many people right now. Where'd 'just flu' bruhs go? Yeah, would nice control winter, could normal christmas. Translation: 18, old enough decide liability gotta solve ludicrously high housing costs, low wages homelessness got shinning light america! I'll never understand people feel need talk treat others poorly. They're even capable treating grocery workers decently awful time. bill house proposed blocked senate pushed bill focused corporations. neither got passed congress recess trump pushing executive orders something.

I started paying attention government planning stimulus aid kinda stopped reading deadlocked decisions. think people start getting upset starts hit small town America. Maybe battle germaphobia narcissims? like washing like crazy rally.

I see shaking hands fans lot, seems unfamilliar hand shakes. hell? That's good. headline made sound like employees. Yea think one day find circulating US countries since 2019 agree everything except assumption it. pandemic *have* assume anyone come contact might contagious, including coming contact others. There's excuse single person sure personally shed contagious virus. One reasonable estimate US 1:100 people right *now* *contagious* af.

Is bioterrorism? know something close. also agree ""bad decision"" define whole person. I'm life overreach, think *some* jail time willful obstinate covid health guideline non compliance order. (But ""oops walked someone forgot mask""). Assualt related covid aggression dunno, maybe hate crime. penalties that? Bettman's done well. I'd argue even better considering NHL exclusively Canada safer cheaper. thinking read reply. I'd definitely go quarantine tested positive. I'd prefer quarantine house problem hotel needed. course, I'm one idiots would running around trying live life like normal pandemic trying deny even exists. People seem understand types 'forced' situations keep happening many people right fucking thing own. Italian study here: http://www.salute.gov.it/portale/nuovocoronavirus/dettaglioNotizieNuovoCoronavirus.jsp?lingua=italiano&amp;menu=notizie&amp;p=dalministero&amp;id=4998
Gives 1482000 infections 35225 confirmed (most probably underreported) deaths. That's 2,4%, kind averaging UK study. Probably 10k yet. I‚Äôm dept. manager grocery store. make 50k/yr. I‚Äôm dead far advancement goes pays bills. company treated us better could see getting complacent becoming lifer treat us poorly, won‚Äôt discipline bad employees I‚Äôm looking opportunity leave grocery industry. Covid really put shitty practices spotlight we‚Äôre easy ignore.

Shit sucks. See that's kind thinking makes type headline absurd. Obviously locked houses viruses would die out, DUH. problem many things humans society need survive make possible. Everyone screams ""freedom"" ""freedumb"" anytime can, forget outside uneducated members right (and left matter), one claiming stay home orders work, work way thought would (eradication disease) used forever, true. Lol I‚Äôm saying shouldn‚Äôt used Europe Us(the vaccine tried 38 people - nowhere near enough) tables type laugh masks, feel entitled served, get annoyed we‚Äôre serving food disposable containers ‚Äúthe virus isn‚Äôt real anyway‚Äù.

That would main dumbasses *eating restaurants*. rest us still eating home sitting amongst horde morons dine would stupid. don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre using right Meanwhile...‚Äùughhhhh, don‚Äôt *want* go back work make money! pass another unemployment stimulus check already keep getting food delivered via doordash.‚Äù people honestly look better mask Bettman actually done ton grow game hockey outside Canada. Perhaps I'm pessimistic, there's much still go wrong.

* First, need 70% immunity sure infection chains fizzle out. means need `vaccine efficacy * vaccination rate 0.7`. vaccine already less 70% efficacy, much use regard.
* vaccine must confer immunity long enough actually inject everyone need start over.
* There's potential becoming immune vaccine itself, need different one second round. IIRC that's concern least one current candidates.

If works out, guess question whether government wants continue strict eradication strategy (maintaining zero active cases means necessary, case lockdowns would continue), rely vaccine ""take care of"" local measles outbreak year ago, lockdown then

Personally, even know option year ago, doubt present people's minds general. Perhaps happened year now, reaction would look different. Hello. recently built new Covid-19 tracker India. I'm planning build one US soon. I'm 17. side project, monetary gain. grown loved New England, found Minnesota everything NE is, even better. Lol, you‚Äôre clearly embarrassed ashamed intellect deleted initial comments. pompous asshole pretending one bit information made superior guy. That‚Äôs people effectively communicate.

No one, besides apparently, real hard information back March. employers best could, information had, protect employers. 

To go far call people ‚Äúdegenerate learning,‚Äù knowing nothing them, speaks volumes type person are. subject talking based one study, little supporting data, way taken 100%. Yeah sick fuck sub hijacked everything America, honestly. 2nd 3rd russian bot, can't tell certain, least 2 comments. cult Mammon around long time. Isn‚Äôt trump obese? height help skirt diagnosis- he‚Äôs gotta close Technically Varadkar‚Äôs Irish decent, Indian lol answer actually quite simple. Fredrick trump die spanish flu, died 1918, President trump born 1946.

The sad reality never meet grandparent, they're almost story us, feel impact death lessons learned easily.

Case point, maternal grandfather died think 6th heart attack 45 months mother born. 3 grandparents, met. Though important lessons death (I.e. smoke), really register (I smoke parents got message ways.) 6-9-12-15-18 months later many people get 2nd COVID? another 1% die? another 3-5% win weeklong stay hospital? another 10% end long term damage?

Or pre-existing damage make numbers worse... country willing unethically test people, trust results ?! Big brain. people feel small insignificant. using refusal follow mandates, order feel powerful important. trying prove ‚Äúsheep‚Äù like rest us; strong mighty, pushed around.
In actuality, weak-minded, willfully ignorant. Makes wonder tested negative antibodies despite symptoms confirmed case office. Although nearly 4 months apparently last long.  virus remains mystery me. 

I'm nurse NHS London, since beginning pandemic (once spread UK), I've direct contact patients confirmed Covid-19. 

I tested weekly basis since early/mid-April (always negative) antibodies test done early June (also negative antibodies). I've never symptoms ever felt ill time since start back Feb/March. 

At work, use appropriate PPE, wash/sanitise hands regularly, wear normal surgical mask pretty much entire day. Outside work, minimise social contacts, keep distance, wear surgical mask transport, shops, areas reasonable distance cannot maintained. 

By contrast, many colleagues treated exactly patients, environment, PPE got sick C-19 (confirmed positive) eventually recovered.

I really understand virus infects many, getting ill, whilst people remain unaffected it. Weird paid sick time living wage helps stop spread.

I guess solution liability protections corporations.
/s hate say they'll getting killed eventually. survivors ultimately prove medical benefit everyone else. Money always important people here. popularity FB Came say Americans: we're dumb af Absolutely love BBC's choice photo article! Yeah, saying they're human beginning us becoming hate. Dehumanization rarely leads good memories. shower head multiple nozzels, Obama administration defined showerhead restrictions apply comes total. 

It nothing water flow, everything repealing EVERYTHING Obama ever done. 

This fan base loves him, hated Obama conditioned think everything Obama wrong country. exact opposite Obama, must good! new paradigm tent cities. Maybe assumes hotels weak water? thought could understood comment. Exercise need. Power lifting not, I'm sorry. spread virus name power lifting please. point death toll effect big things like housing market unemployment? people wore masks able buy vacant houses pick job positions unfilled? Yes, British British today, monarchy ramifications successful colonial revolution impact future. Thanks. I‚Äôm facts data. peer reviewed randomized control study large sample size test this. virus DNA virus, yes, there's chance. Here's review one virus that's insertion seems biased towards near cancer drivers: first oncogenic gene discovered virus - v-src. Granted, that's causing way insertion would, actually coding oncogenic protein. notion viruses cause cancers new one.

Let stress risk rare designed right. question rare? One million one trillion? like knowing sort thing. joke. one thinking advice basically implies dangerous process is? Fucking joke, playing lives profit. Full stop. Yeah basically. quit couple weeks ago, thank god. mess. Well, really. see countries lighter touch, less socially disruptive response C-19 like Denmark Sweden rank far better terms overall excess deaths look C-19 deaths only. Hmm Actually think propaganda cold war WW era. 

The blindly prideful blindly loyal country, identity challenged admitting mistakes blind problems. think USA always great propaganda led us believe, things like internet covid revealed ugly underbelly. head sand, less address issues. grew near Denver moved Toronto marry immigrate. difference news biggest shocker. rest world laughing US we're arrogant prideful even see problems--much less fix them. also suspect many countries angry US actively trying divide destroy country we've already done ourselves.

See Oatmeal George Washington wooden teeth concept identity ""the greatest country"" deeply rooted problem.

The worst thing wasted potential. could stop bickering throwing mud, could easily start working solving problems quickly country always thought were. US sleeping giant we've neglected ourselves. Time get couch figure works us. US blessed great natural beauty resources, wasted like spoiled teenager know take care themselves. Time grew up. Latest update: COMMON SENSE SOLUTION REDUCING SPREAD VIRUS ACTUALLY REDUCES SPREAD VIRUS! NEWS 11! ""Hair"" add increasing number tests US anti-body tests, due lack PCR test capacity. Unfortunately, anti-body tests high false-negative rate, depending whos number believe 10% 40%. I.e. high number people get negative results, assume Covid-19, yet happily spreading it.

And reason Europe anti-body test used quick check positivity hospital settings, quickly weed sure. test comes back negative, sample goes PCR testing. But... managed keep cases rest world! praise undisputable ability handling it? love mumble/whisper question decide mask issue hearing remove it? N95 filtration rating. Industrial grade respirators often vent allow easier exhalation. Doctors use unvented respirators protect others. ""Group large women"" fixed worked kroger back 2018 case back then. customers managers thick skulled see human. policies put place reduce testing? Or, less demand testing?

you're asking wrong questions. question done - WASN""T done -- accelerate turnaround test results? without rapid results, test essentially pointless. real problem southern ones, actually followed rules... first weeks is. saw learned virus wasn‚Äôt south. saw news didn‚Äôt match ground. combined fatigue taught behaviorally everything A-OK. That‚Äôs getting right wing MUH FREEDOM stuff.

There‚Äôs nothing that‚Äôs gonna stop people going socializing virus finally gets communities clean band aid helps get rid infection. desperately need new performance indicator social contract business capitalism wants survive. need put people's wellbeing first, profits. Right ""I got mine, fuck you"" pro-life care 200,000 dead. Hopefully spike cases ten years ten days followed case acting like victim blaming virus targeted harassment Ugh. That's really fuckin' greasy. Gree-hee-hee-heasy. They're trying fudge numbers many tests they're stupid understand work ... would normal environment. However, currently, virtual. normally large room (science). could accommodate several kids per period spread throughout room. class sizes reasonable already (22-23) spread out. Pushing 30 able accomplished. problem worldwide. stop testing, cases, know? Slow testing please! 

/s case. Probably two three die football season. worth risk enjoyment football season - Illinois, state thats interested containment unlike happening South talking about? multiple studies antibodies waning mild cases forming enough antibodies detected. literally article sub yesterday almost 2/1 inaccuracies test. Yeah, that‚Äôs used credit card? credit cards 2010, obviously. ‚ÄûGeldkarte‚Äú completely different concept system.  Weren‚Äôt 1000 Plus deaths day New York? Early crisis? withdrawing routine care population dire effects.

Fortunately lot routine dental care evidence based probably excessive. would teachers want go conditions stakes much higher now?
 
Many might not, that's prerogative (and quit deal breaker them). Remote learning, specifically K - 5 students, barely learning. Oh millions looking noses obvious fat people step scale check BMI chart doubt. might shocked! seems addiction. Monetary avarice heroin. They're junkies. Working class people kind treated like humans this? Yeah summer turned 16. worked foundry 2 years layoff, &amp; thought that‚Äôd nice change environment. 3 months saw enough badly owners customers treated min wage employees actually ran around working asses stocking, cleaning &amp; fixing place day, went back foundry, even you‚Äôre obscenity battle 5 guys day wrong turn meant death, wasn‚Äôt awful piggly wiggly run psychos. ever? Coworker, friend. right trying stop coming country? guy go work 5 days sick/symptomatic?  Yeah god forbid people get find joy something right? constantly worrying things cannot change fighting hard enough. Call crazy think going work. stole Oxford died lockdown? work grocery store. took away covid pay last month. people normal again. rude. Honestly whatever I'm high school, I've adults call fuc*ing moron. Best part make 9.00 hour plus I'm adult. However government still takes 8.032 percent paycheck. Could press secretary attitude! interesting true. December last year horrible cough. symptoms, wracking awful cough lasted weeks. kid sick Christmas. Fever, cough, exhausted. tested negative flu strep. pediatrician shocked flu. Husband got that. believe numbers either, since testing actually gone way states United States, since months ago. Aside food, tools, ect...

Just bartering would back vogue mean value concept would disappear. people acted truly shitty 9/11 regardless leadership. Muslim people demonized anyone anti-war shunned. people, leaders. leaders stoked sentiment, sure. people innocent. true. people well time. know them. one them.

There also places work ""high morale"". Places lot make things better, increasing employee wages, lowering hours, increasing benefits, letting people work home.

I friend example got 20k bonus one month work Covid. cannot make foolish blanket statements like true.

There 300 million people country bad time right now. know. sucks. easy means change huge aspect life. fuck. think America bad, work American firm spend lot time there. always enjoy America. think they've absolutely shit handling pandemic.

And think China without fault happily criticize them. think find post people make really stupid ignorant comments China.

Such as, tell world crisis. long con, big dirty. Trump press briefing saying US better job Germany EU countries rates dropping EU rates increasing. yet can't control know strongly suspected infected getting near others. Yes, yes is. misconception taxation us Canada. actually worked numbers couple days ago see factored shocked me...we taxed oblivion, government (income, sales, various others including luxury) ""health insurance"". worse, hits lower income people even harder higher income people.

Quoting US people want think money comes magic pocket dimension. It, course, doesn‚Äôt, also don‚Äôt realize factor healthcare...the average American actually paying WAY 40% average, based great health plan max pocket $12,000 per year. good plan. also ‚Äúper check‚Äù premiums give access healthcare (but benefit, covers average citizen makes $60,000 per year family four, doesn‚Äôt work. Take 22% income tax. 6.2% Social Security. 1.45% - 13,200 - 3720 - 870 = takes another $400+, per paycheck, ‚Äúmembership‚Äù. = $42,410 - $9,600 = entire pocket, $12,000... get $32,810 - $12,000 $20,810 left rent two bedroom apartment Dallas, TX (didn‚Äôt account state income tax state income tax) = $1,250...so $20,810 - $15000 = groceries, clothing, school supplies activities (spitballing), transportation -$10,000 -$20,000 left year. going debt, escape...just way life US fucked. engineered people go stay debt. people profit super wealthy banks apartment MASSIVE difference healthcare. situation far better that. Even worse, lose job US, healthcare pocket... Yea, I‚Äôm going keep wiping groceries, thanks. aware old counting method worked? They're basically admitting useful. needs work well protecting elderly people getting sick effective. claim based nothing wishful thinking.

In contrast many studies different countries different tests give sales result also agree cruise ship studies based entirely PCR tests. ‚ÄúWow, surprising!‚Äù -literally one works retail teacher forced back would call sick first week. Unlikely going stay open long. England, time limit. Someone recovered Covid-19 March died car crash July would counted coronavirus death. 

Straight article Yet ignore gathering 10,000 people ""protest"" article says states ‚Äúpulling back‚Äù testing, doesn‚Äôt explain further.

Are policies put place reduce testing? Or, less demand testing?

At least St. Louis testing demand seems function people symptoms people living working people symptoms.

For example: someone office got Covid, everyone office went got tested. three weeks ago.

Other people know gotten tested describe thing. know someone it, got tested.

If cases declining shouldn‚Äôt therefore also see decline demand tests? word expendable, one except charge screwing over, low pay, benefits, etc use behind closed doors among peers. 
 
The public wants feel good ignore reality, ie shoppers want damn 'servants' go work, that's elite get live mansions. That's privileged get work home well, want go get take eat outside restaurants open indoor dining etc. 
 
It never happen could write legislation anyone deemed 'essential' gets extra pay 1.5-2x must granted medical coverage, given extra PTO addition anything might without penalty essential businesses close doors STILL PAY them. huge issue government step keep people ther jobs pay let stay home really needed, ie movie theaters etc. Instead let get fired/furloughed pushed onto unemployment. No. reject notion feeling call desire teach means risk life unstoppable contagious disease. Remote learning isn‚Äôt ideal, it‚Äôs better dying. 

My school last year ran soap paper towels bathroom almost daily. never hot water bathroom. Teachers provided hand sanitiser tissues got. classrooms got swept day (if lucky) trash emptied. extent cleaning. weren‚Äôt even allowed use cleaning products - even them. 

So would teachers want go conditions stakes much higher now? Everybody aware cases/deaths reflect possibility person getting covid dying... baffles healthcare (in country) doesnt focus prevention. 

Uh healthcare focused one thing 'Murca. Extracting last fucking dime die leave Earth. Oh making health insurance CEO's fabulously, filthy fucking rich, that's two guess. don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre right. People huffing puffing everywhere. That‚Äôs schools universities aren‚Äôt open yet really hinges lot assumption coronavirus permanent though, definable victory? vehement mask supporters really support idea year two, coronavirus still among us, simply say ""Well, tried, clearly going solve problem outright let's drop mask order even though still make difference transmission rates.""?

Look history respiratory illness; 1918, 2009, SARS... ever actually eradicated respiratory illness become pandemic? I'm aware of, I'd curious know I'm wrong.

Further digging history 1918 mask orders would probably enlightening, wonder point gave those, despite fact spanish flu never went away. businessinsider.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

Everyone waiting feel better never do, shitty normal. think I'm really hard worker people dont notice much, notice.

I worked passing job recently making lot cautious getting corona. got even useless body permanently damaged, might lose live. playing tests numbers.... gaslighting truly taken around, going winter blind, dumb, fools.

... probably dead.  goes good ol'e south. require login I'd look... Oh well Supposedly high false negative rate antibody tests . . . I'm thinking thing Canada. People small towns seem actually taking precautions wearing masks. mom let see first time weekend. Since virus. Everyone home town wearing masks. Litteraly everyone went about. Compared live, people wearing masks get stores. true lot areas. wife used ER nurse former co-workers keeps touch said since COVID actually slowest they've ever seen it. People coming random minor things. There's ""I've vague leg pain 4 months decided go ER random Tuesday 4am even though different been"" type people.  Correct. types COVID die freezer, types suspended.

For people know, leggo frozen eggo toaster, leggo frozen covid fingers, pick nose. didn‚Äôt family I‚Äôd volunteer second. us willing bit fight this. people good people. Dude love grandparents parents I'm ready boomers die off. real. Someone follow college twitter they... overwhelming response players want play, everyone, most. matter time hybrid plan fails well. get it. morbid.. think averaging arguably worst hit country time optimal treatments covid discovered hospitals overflowing gives best estimation. It'll nice studies compare to.

I think rate 2% probably India Brazil end unfortunately. developed nations it'll closer UK numbers. Still way high. scare too. Except every one tips fairly? Media Europe criticizing testing US since March. one believes numbers US publishes. Europe's view, trustworthy China Iran... mind you, China control Iran excuse money equipment proper testing. much $ goes padding C suite/executive talking heads already comically vast treasures, nothing left pay people take real risk deserve ""combat pay"". Hell, told wife (teacher) Umm, yeahhh going provide PPE literally risk lives fall"" last straw. preclinical (or least time) device called Healigbt essentially supposed that, development jointly Cedars-Sinai medical technology company. think it‚Äôs garbled version made head. worth, despite USA's constant upfucking, UK still ahead basically every Western country terms fatalities per capita. things somewhat control infer either achieve herd immunity 5% pop infected US quite long ways go.before burns own.  I'm guessing reason things better controlled UK moment reasons 5% magic number. - also, many white men. Yep. 

Don't trust CDC, said ""don't worry disinfecting surfaces anymore, even though told earlier COVID lives 3 days plastic/metal 1 day cardboard"". peak infection, Britain mostly testing people getting hospitalised virus. people generally old poor health already. makes sense significant numbers would dying every day causes.

England's method line countries, including parts UK. find new method suspicious, hope equally suspicious everyone else uses it. example, hope equally suspicious countries like Italy Spain, deaths per day dropped single figures Britain 50-100 per day, despite similar numbers cases. strategy demonize front-line government workers rather corporations run country ground next quarter's profits.

Fuck that. I'm even sure government employees talking about, agencies open desperately trying serve people ever ever-dwindling amount resources.

Seriously, get fuck bullshit. think gets unemployed people weekly check?

Just fuck off. you‚Äôre Vet lost limb war, there‚Äôs VA others looking (bettter worse) recognized, COVID-Invalids? see, thing called *social safety net*. real first world countries ... thing government swoops help monetarily need hit bad times....

Quick question fuck China number 1! Fuck Found J :O Nobody saw coming follow. see thermal imaging far particles spread masked vs unmasked, know asymptomatic carriers exist. Seriously, made think logic? would believe states (R) governor best adhere lower testing equals lower infection. AR live cases shown states dept. county unless upper part state density.

The nursing homes using dementia wards(if them) quarantining wards EMS longer responding nursing home calls. 

I asymptomatic cousin works one nursing homes test positive doc facilities told quarantine two weeks follow up.

Yet, work food service people tested cannot return work unless test negative. person work test positive(different shift) still can't work tests positive. Oh, **bullshit.** Canada put politics aside got shit done federal-provincial-local chain. New Zealand virtually eliminated it. Thailand Vietnam well too.

Don't play devil's advocate, devil need advocates ONE party idiotic, malignant narcissist leader advocating already. Same. I‚Äôm middle aged woman tip well. Also used work retail fast food. immediately used good attacking wrong people wrong way. 

And bothering take responsibility makes things right. families bombed get it, right? NZ always expected come back surprises always warned stay ready.

There much still unknown virus. Imo course action willingly sacrifices people‚Äôs lives little yet known tragic stupidity. that, it‚Äôs quickly spreads get in. Exponential growth scary. You‚Äôre humans, you‚Äôre Heroes ‚Ñ¢! lets us sacrifice sell Doritos. I‚Äôd one hundred percent board masks indeed ‚Äúgot shit with.‚Äù I‚Äôm saying they‚Äôre effective, saying real world, mask mandates correlated strongly reduced transmissions. fact, California saw opposite effect saying they‚Äôre useless, saying evidence shouldn‚Äôt *that* invisible given effective people claim need open immigration let teachers in.  stupid, would better give even bonus. least ones front lines dealing infected.

This bill would allow people deal covid get 800k student debt forgiveness never contact someone infected give nothing many healthcare workers staff either qualify healthcare workers already paid school loans. read Southern accent. Smash Mouth hate Washington post links, anyways damn paywall 4. Take personal leave first two weeks watch carnage. come every white person (male female) opposes masks look like bird? fast food employees, proball bunch folks probally got exposed allready. What's wrong women?* women cant classified people. Like one called cop dude trying walk dog something. used work retail always ask customers ‚ÄúHow today?‚Äù Secret shoppers would report didn‚Äôt. rare occasions someone would say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine. *How you?*‚Äù always felt like absolute greatest act kindness shit day. always ask cashiers day going. It‚Äôs fine don‚Äôt feel like answering, least want show interest person.  imagine opening schools hanging around without masks. wait they‚Äôre replaced self-checkout *HO¬≠NK HO¬≠NK*
 
Clo¬≠wn world logic. reality they're but¬≠thurt handful people smart enough 'beat system' wearing type mask actually works preventing catching virus.
 
Everyone must participate security theatre. Everyone must wear worthless cloth masks catch virus eventually. one gets wear respirator protected virus. now. pretend entire fucking thing political reason. hit point couple months ago.

I left birthday party 10 people 0 masks.

Find people neighborhood agrees.

The lockdown stupi d. news article executive order. linked executive order exemption mentioned. literally linked order. exemption. hard understand? let Americans in?! test 700k 12 th aug , went 400 Althought one person probally infected bunch people allready. daughter caught acting irresponsibly, passed ton old, frail, weak, decrepit, pitiful, scrawny father. ever? Human connection important r/thingshappen got test central phoenix employment purposes. lines, wait, lots openings. Easy peasy. Embry Womens Health rocks. definitely idea happened backed evidence. Seeing know universe came existence, seems like simple place start understand God's existence. Here's short answer: something cannot come nothing, whoever started creation universe God. 
I think basic example God's existence. fake news, /s/ We‚Äôve used A/C handful days summer - exception night time. would much rather fresh air windows, even it‚Äôs little hotter normal use fans. feel like cannot breathe well A/C. second open windows go outside, feel much better. Phase 3 needs certain percentage control group catch virus. pandemic lot easier achieve. Fun fact: effectiveness ‚Äúplan b‚Äù morning type pills goes hit certain BMI. say like Chili's calling employees ChiliHeads. That's all. Everything else bad hate it. wife funeral industry, lots people dying rigjht covid related. large families show funeral home ready party, tries tell social distance, wear masks usual, treat like utter shit. says one cares pandemic happening. Yes, backloading already said. Letter sorters replaced parcel sorters, letter volume down. Iowa Postal Worker's Union President worried unprepared election.

You're mad think I'm misleading you, quotes article. article clickbait. West Virginia much. Getting message enough people seems major issue common sense waste time appeasing paranoid delusionists Ugh, New Zaeland virus free months, hell? elected judges, understand, they're children! Children can't possible spread virus! could seen coming! cannot help notice (and observation) baby boomers handled situation absolute worst generation currently alive. angry, rotten, selfish, entitled, anti-intellectual idiots ever met. WWII generation (who actually stands sometimes life hard need make sacrifices), Gen X, Millenials, Gen Z wearing masks, socially distancing (again, I‚Äôm speaking general terms, always exceptions rule) they‚Äôre supposed help curb pandemic, old boomers whining, kicking screaming every step way they‚Äôre fucking selfish feel entitled certain easy way life. It‚Äôs bullshit.

Honestly fuck boomers.

Sorry rant lol

JFC, wonder everybody left sub. STILL back claim asked twice now. obviously NOTHING whatsoever back claim all. *I'm* asshole here! funny.

I guess I'll leave bullshitting guys head back r/COVID19, peer-reviewed research grown-ups discuss pandemic. Wannabelievers disgust me. 17C (62F) Auckland yesterday. winter average around 15C/59F. winter since mid-May zero cases whole season now. way related seasons would cases May instead exact opposite. 2 weeks away start Spring now. time shocking number people believed HIV specifically targeted gays. virus preference sexual orientation. second day, student probally infected bunch people allready. actually brainwashed thinking 1 every 3 people kept voting moron sense discussing further. good day Amway selling children's fruit flavored anti-COVID chewy tablets end school year, mark words. leave P100 respirator, goggles, face shield hat. 

You consider wearing disposable gloves whenever go too. pretty cheap. fact medial professionals work confirmed covid patients everyday, get infected. perfectly possible correct PPE. Hopefully universe make pay damage they're doing.

The universe going anything. Collect evidence building staff wearing masks, sue building owners. way make people take seriously. got kidding me. hit girl sign pissed size table limit. fuck wrong y'all? that‚Äôs abysmal 1M tests. 

Let‚Äôs fool ourselves, almost many daily deaths US, Mexico millions cases. whole reason shit agency DHS created. interesting paper. However, main author [no references co-authors identified ""a father-son team"".

Well, seem peer-reviewed.

But basically opinion, thoughts worth investigating, actual evidence another essay, ""Introducing 21st Century's New Four Horsemen Coronapocalypse"", earlier volume journal, offering different point new Horsemen Extreme centralization increasing fragility supply chains.

It seems opinionated essays find home here. I'm really making effort now, ask day going, always thank working every time countries - local taxes lower US ones. case vast majority (if all) European countries. Canada completely shut border much earlier exceptions people traveling Alaska. wonder many cases tracked back US? 

The thing understand still planning send kids back school despite ongoing outbreaks. 

NZ probably country look example. recent resurgence 4 cases things back lock down. sort thing work poor leadership big anti-mask population. US really looking pretty sad point. absolutely fake news. look actual bill. even cost $1 trillion give ""everybody"" $1,200. since youre lazy, cost $300b stimulus checks, comparison, corporations got $500b bail *so it‚Äôs 1?* Lol India testing Us like 3 days tested 300k 12th aug what's that? fuck.

Paywall mirror: treasurer charge funds assigned fix system money got spent elsewhere. clearly partial blame this. laughable tend smarter give lifetime appointments smarter mean tend appoint younger judges decades. instance, look SCOTUS conservative justices, Roberts appointed age 50. Thomas 43. Gorsuch 49. Kavanaugh 53. Alito old guy 56. liberals, Ginsburg 60. Breyer almost 56 (missed 12 days). Sotomayer 55. Kagan youngster 50. youngest liberal Court would've barely edged third youngest conservative (Roberts) age appointment 3 basically par lagging oldest conservative age appointment. Repeat across hundred federal seats adds time.

Currently there's still 1 272 (.4%) federal judges serving appointed Carter, 18 383 (4.7%) Reagan, 14 193 (7.3%) HW Bush, 88 378 (23.8%) Clinton, 166 327 (50.8%) W Bush, 314 329 (95.4%) Obama, 200 203 (98.5%) Trump. Carter 8.5% Reagan's at. Reagan 64.4% HW at. HW 30.7% Clinton at. Clinton 46.9% W's at. W's 53.2% Obama's at. Obama's 96.9% Trump at. every Democratic president still judges serving, Obama currently exceeds half rate judges remaining successor we're realistic it, there's probably recency bias since last Democrat serve less full term since last office. HW Bush failed reach 50% Republicans Reagan W Bush still mark. Even drop Carter list since he's practically 0%, Reagan W Bush still exceeding Clinton's performance served would expect impact worse since even young judge appointed late 1992 towards end HW's single term would likely well past normal retirement age now. Areas Copenhagen dense London misleading statement I‚Äôve read days:

 say Sweden ""did"" it, worries over. Sweden success story. herd immunity materializing everyone desk, phone, really office? half office nearly work home? Work mostly shitty everyone begin with, wear mask day work home torture...no?  make sure children receive education 

You know, I'm less worried part. Odds decent we'll either beat manage time next year.  entire planet dumps this. Economies strained, schools session in.  kids make year mediocre learning socializing time. able make losing parent, friend, teacher developing chronic heart, lung, kidney brain issues.  OK decide going pretty crap academic year nearly country world. focus health survival. 

YMMV, sanest decision parent make, though certainly easiest. History rarely wrong, unfortunately. But... legitimate elections president even congress. Even ignoring plentiful cases election fraud, system designed provide terribly disproportional representation based districts drawn since can't redistrict entire states, Electoral College fills role presidential elections. Since didn‚Äôt go college can‚Äôt really follow discussion. dumb. Sometimes brain terrible thing use hope wrong. Treatment methods improving every day vaccine sort seems like real possibility next 2-3 months.

BUT

People getting lax following guidelines exhausted. Things reopening precautions world protect every mistake could happen. Florida still horrible contact tracing horrible return times testing makes data basically useless I'm sure states similar issues.

Plus, schools reopening. serious risk causing rapid spread kids bad mask rules/distancing. kids many schools seem resigned accept whatever happens rather actively enforce masks distancing. Kids might decently resilient (though long term affects still unknown serious short term side effects definitely impossible) even asymptomatic people carry virus spread it. family's probably wearing masks home make spread really fast inside households. serious possibility schools nationwide almost shut within month causing MASSIVE spike cases.

PLUS, get closer election get intense politicization issue meaning people digging heels wearing masks avoiding stupid activities right now. Like recent Smash Mouth concert people packed like sardines sheriff Fl banning masks office.

&amp;#x200B;

There serious chance next two months getting WAY worse terms virus spread. Stupid rule, masks great way reduce chance catching virus. exposure time. 2 meters magical solution enclosed space poor ventilation. Putting removing mask constantly almost bad all. bulk time office desk main time breathe aerosols people. Wear mask times. Congratulations! beat covid-19 going now.

That's fucking stupid. course can. cannot quantify accurately, people understand untested medicine carried risks, people would never thought test medicine.

People capable weighing risk incompletely tested vaccines active pandemic. data improves, people similarly adjust decisions.

The correct way test vaccines traditional, hyper-conservative 3-phase trial, single phase, continuous ramp up. Millions would saved, agencies irrationally risk averse. They're afraid headline, ""Vaccine causes high fever 100 people"", ""3 million dead virus"".

I know places ""me me"" people care less greater good society large, imo *good democracies* work vast majority, least keep mind. 14 day incubation period, plus possibility asymptomatic transmission, possibility individual getting terribly sick infection, still passing on

We're level 3 lockdown now, likely weekend we'll level 4

The suburb family resides close international airport, live maybe 10 minutes away area. We'll fine lockdown rules, plus Director General strongly advised wearing masks going essential reasons like grocery shopping, work essential service

As side note, [the UK dropped death total turns way counting deaths retarded. Expect total drop again. surprised totals countries equally suspect. lower death count, less dangerous virus turns been.

**EDIT:** Several people pointed virus Causing Covid 19 called "" SARS-CoV-2"" (originally 2019-*nCoV* ) therefore MUST closer SARS. fallacious argument.

The whole thing lunacy Young people less likely believe American Dream, less likely cushy abundance due America's unbelievable position fortune post-WW2. *cannibalization peasantry* phase collapsing empire.

Most people grew post-WW2 America wanted basically nothing. Yes many worked hard, exchange work could afford house, car, education, healthcare, kids, pension, etc etc. work hard (or even harder) never able afford house (or spend 50%+ income pay mortgage), education easily put unescapable debt back 15-20 years more, healthcare unbelievably expensive health insurance unaffordable many youngsters single medical emergency without insurance instant bankruptcy, kids unbelievably expensive, pensions (burdens employers must pay) ""changed"" 401k matching plans (at *best*- fuck also possible) effectively pumps stock market, unions destroyed, etc etc etc. DEEP cannibalizing peasantry.

This basically thing happened Romans 3rd century AD- taxes raised fund changes saw Romans nearly took empire, taxes effectively destroyed peasants ended selling wealthy landowners, selling children slavery, starving death, etc. difference much complex society, thus cannibalization far sophisticated, easier obscure via disassociative structures, etc. Wow. spray orifices need better friends! main reason people wearing due fogging spectacles/glasses.
For typical 3-ply mask, every time exhale, air leaks bit eyes. amount adjustment fix that. end day, eyes get extremely painful. I'm enduring every day. communist Vietnam figure out, we.

[JHU corroborates this, shows positivity rate pretty steady around 7-8%, good terrible either (relatively within striking distance usual ""recommended"" 3-5% able normal things), moderately declining recent weeks.

I love testing goes percentage cases go greater percentage, everyone lightning fast point ""the increase cases can't explained increase testing look everyone, testing 15% cases 25%"" exact shit reverse, testing 12% cases 20%, oh must lies government conspiracy. actually research confirm this? waste time effort, spending time real question ""do humans need oxygen survive?"". saw leper colonies worked... ‚Äúessential‚Äù government/businesses‚Äô way saying ‚Äúexpendable‚Äù *"" including United States ""*

Like 5-6/day walk around block. also see lot younger employees videochat appears childhood bedroom workplace, I'm company pays new grads $200K/year. Actually law correctly applied: released sooner good behavior.

If required sit enclosed room one person one hour select either random stranger wearing valved N95 random stranger wearing cotton mask insane pick cotton mask person.

You arguing masks wearers independent random samples: ""There's equal probability wearer infected attention focuses lower statistical probability exhaled virus getting cotton instead directly vented.""

You seem thought enough understand \*mechanics\* mask differences, enough realize that, large, ""mask problem"" spectrum ranges 1) idiots wear all, 2) idiots wear temporarily get door somewhere, 3) idiots wear chin strap accomplish nothing, 4) average person wears cotton gets minimal protection gives moderate protection others to, 5) full-blown ""I absolutely determined ANYTHING need order keep getting this"" N95. That's guy want next next someone. He's vastly less likely it.

You're angry wrong people. Jesus epidemiologist.  stole country still neglects human beings, let alone citizens. Voting one two horrendous political parties got, fix intrinsic problems.
 countries, confinement giving thanks people exposed virus could get groceries.
The problem goes beyond stupid bi-partisan system. Yeah, meant throw nearby lake haha. update, back head test massive swab largely date. newer tests swab around nostril. basically accurate require specialized giant swab.  Instacart shoppers come across bit needy sometimes (especially new ones learn things are). I've never rude abusive one.

Remember covid stuff see lagging two weeks minimum, due incubation time I've least noticed recently like within past week. like /aboringdystopia. thought anything different service industry people. feel supported enough get away it. Clearly time reopen schools. first couple months made point clear acknowledging someone working unusual concerns. would thank continuing best. Recently think careless used ""normal"" polite words, though normal days. Thank making come attention. stressful time think good clearer appreciation ""common courtesy"" Look bright side...

we've trying lower prison population years! Covid CT scans hospital bagger again. Baggers still exist? Wow. think Texas 325 also record. second job movie theatre two managers stoners well friends. got train projectionist would rather sleep office go roof smoke. would stayed longer pay better. Also ''art house'' theatre, general population movie-goers. almost certainly plays role sick people get.

 think part tied Global Warming denial unwillingness accept message BLM, etc - simply can't take board serious problems world, possibly ignoring problems social concerns worked far; they've lived civil rights movement, cold war, sorts economic social issues without actually affecting -- world gone shit 401k ok. 
 
Like everything else see someone else's problem outraged they're asked acknowledge lifestyle affected, even small way forces feel like they're part something happening people. work EMS grocery store employees(and gas station) get along better Cops Fire, comes overlooked. Ambulance services like underappreciated three first responders. Fire Police get reports heroics, ambulance guys got still alarm freeway tonight, dragged stroking patient car, dont make news. Cars went flying past, ignoring lights. damn even see shadow blue light people change lanes. Plus discounts! Wheres paramedic discount? went school 2 years get less first responder discount 3 month trained cop? ""We"" drop anything. large number people US still home waiting out. Donald Trump administration dropped ball\^H\^H\^H\^H\^H\^H\^H\^H\^H\^H\^H\^H\^H\^H\^H\^H *killed people*. real data scientist understands logistic maps explain.

So federalism reason. This. Testing prevalence based antibodies alone flawed numerous reasons. It‚Äôs likely large undercount IMO. Well, first things first... lot people get covid tested tests add positivity rates. client spoke yesterday said Covid exposed kind unkind. thinking Covid definitely politicized much demonization other.

So reading wrote brought smile face. :) work healthcare local board health. I‚Äôm somewhat informed spreads risks. masking spread blunted degree. Make mistake SITUATION SUCKS. 
But shutting schools economy also sucks. 
For example (I won‚Äôt specific) live medium town (12-18,000 people range) northeast hard-hit County. locked nearly two months. got bad here. 
I mask contact people everyday work. 
However, put perspective 100 confirmed cases ONE death. One death far entire pandemic. pray mans family, I‚Äôm sad much. 
But also seen huge number small businesses wiped out. Abandoned buildings store fronts. businesses 40+ years old gone. People laid-off left right. 
Reddit treats like pariah mention economic impact it‚Äôs real. Evictions coming. government can‚Äôt print money forever. 
Instead name-calling pointing virtue signaling figures someone really acknowledge points civil debate. excess deaths studies putting US total right 200,000 official COVID deaths right 160,000, difference ~25%. estimate, would imply real number somewhere around 1,850. know, lot bands time around anymore. got fame guess decided hold loosely never let go. think that? measles outbreak year ago, lockdown population vaccinated. vaccine widely available, lockdowns needed. Minimum wage Ontario quite high - $14 - one lose healthcare lost quit job. response perfect, provincial federal government took seriously, cases relative population much lower. Ontario reported 95 cases yesterday, 33 day before.  


You complain government Canada least they're governments supposed try protect people, rather throwing hands air saying, ""It is, certain percentage population must die!"" r/coronavirus scary.

I think foreign company that's probably why. You‚Äôre dumb. Log off. Ok sure but, like said, far definitive 50% number come from? US alone would mean minimum 2.5M people reporting long term effects? Maybe rate old people, old people already feel 'off' achey bodies, notice minor symptoms easily. Young people usually feel like shit may notice often.

As fatality rate, study finds antibodies, however everybody caught covid *has* antibodies. There's evidence many people gain immunity via T-cell response, meaning herd immunity obtained population relatively low rate antibodies. would put true number people caught illness much higher study suggests (2-4 times much). would say IFR around 0.5% - 1%. certainly do. point foolish think obscenely wealthy crumbling society better merely well n thriving society. Matt Hancock

There's nice conspiracy theory says UK lockdown delayed Hancock's links horseracing industry - he's MP Haymarket famous course. idea allowed Cheltenham festival go ahead (250k people 4 days) meant delaying lockdown - started 3 days Cheltenham ended.

England right change counting method match Scotland, 41,000 accurate 46,000 consider deaths able count within remit daily basis.

But regarding excess deaths figure, many people died outside healthcare sector can't accurately counted daily (currently 41,000) figure COVID-19 listed death certificate.

Basically, yes 65,000 COVID-19 deaths include 5,000 they've deducted. Lol look mad dumb hillbilly getting 

He's probably weak little nerd hahaha make alot money Camps, think like call them. We're find I've working entire time, office customers coming in, due essential worker business sell things hospitals, also things made possible factories switch production lines. fall category ""firefighter, grocery store worker, garbage collector"" so, considered essential workers enough risk daily, enough benefit ""hero's pay"" anything I've seen come up. You‚Äôre labeling me. You‚Äôre tribal. Humans tribal. Instead looking complex issue like ‚ÄúI know guy...meathead‚Äù, society today. Red vs blue, urban vs rural. People don‚Äôt critically think. 
My kid bully, mother public school teacher, uncle administrator, I‚Äôm family teachers...I‚Äôm also Midwest. 
Unions often good. improve working conditions. prevented kids coal mines, etc. 
But, family involved local local schools boards...they get labeled ‚Äútough‚Äù ‚Äúcontroversial‚Äù DARE talk KIDS. want slightly longer school day. want free sports. want school least somewhat run like business, meritocracy. frustrated EVER able fire clearly bad teacher. pretty much hit kid something sexually inappropriate kid fired. It‚Äôs nearly impossible fire teacher bad job. teachers unions interest teachers. kids don‚Äôt union. 
In area can‚Äôt even think becoming teacher without masters degree. won‚Äôt hire you. didn‚Äôt used need masters degree teach. quality gone up? Likely not. 
I considered changing careers teach. qualified teach high school math, economics, etc. 
It long expensive process even get point interviewed. YES saying people math degrees, chemistry degrees, economics degrees, shot teach. Without years years, tens thousands dollars union. Teachers ‚Äúmajor teaching‚Äù shouldn‚Äôt death grip jobs. Period. 

No one saying ‚Äúteachers nothing‚Äù...I saying teachers shouldn‚Äôt paid taxpayers nothing (if strike.) That‚Äôs completely different thing. 

Now again, (unless want ‚Äúcompare bullshit plate‚Äù) nurses prison guards, etc. job hard don‚Äôt like it...quit. 

See respond directly points without labeling name calling. might learn something things people?!?!? boils thing: people don‚Äôt care people dying, straight fails register sort emotion them. Lack empathy cornerstone view world, it‚Äôs drives beliefs about: healthcare, criminal justice, systematic racism, gun control, immigration, welfare, education, etc. try cover patchwork political view, it‚Äôs way keep admitting (or others) zero care people. part closing 7pm. thus, excess deaths consequence Covid-19 well. Agreed sentiment. family basically done nothing what's necessary past 6 months (store, doctor, work necessary) definitely taking toll them. parents grandparents enough conditions they'd enough risk it'd hit hard keep need to.

It feels like we're stuck endless loop sides yelling tiny steps forward backwards. I've heard couple cases ""it's bad hospital, must bad."" it‚Äôs anything like public schools area very, little except rather sad attempts security theatre order try bluff virus staying away. Lmao, shitty mom even make sure went school. I'm reading book now, seems like 1918 flu traumatizing people want talk hear it.

It's lot stuff like guy goes check family, two kids alive parent two kids lying dead flat. horror stuff really. pretty easy call me. Exercise possible without gym. Makes sense since people surgical masks relying others spray aerosols across cabin. evolving less less population every answer

Makes sense planes. outside fact someone wearing mask win even right type mask. Texas. did, right work state, real power. Tbh experience, ask cashiers they‚Äôre doing, answer either stressed ‚Äúgood‚Äù, ‚Äúfine‚Äù, obviously true, kindof sigh/groan/roll eyes openly show stress. feel like resent asked miserable. feel obvious don‚Äôt love job it‚Äôs misery personified. try pleasant get quickly. believe should. Hopefully person also....best wishes~ Corporations still make 5% businesses US today. Sole proprietorships account around 75% businesses. What's cutoff mind rare became prevelant? seem prevalent certain companies monopoly powers wield ruthlessly, history repeating itself? We're basically Gilded Age except divide longer natives immigrants much entrenched powers executive classes mostly everyone else. ridiculous diet food pseudoscience, starters. that‚Äôs okay. Antibody tests measurable sensitivity fairly predictable. applied large scale, estimate antibody levels population, sensitivity specificity measurements come play counter false positives false negatives better estimate true level seroprevalence. That‚Äôs studies mostly relevant population infected high enough estimated accurately. There's much wrong post. First off, post say ""some"" grocery workers. give number, percentage grocery workers, says grocery workers. say grocery workers, saying grocery workers. course can't even open website pay view, offer one month $1 membership, I'm betting reoccurring, forget cancel, bill second month automatically, states (in thousands) Walmart Inc employs 2,200, Kroger Co 460, Publix 201, Albertsons Cos. Inc. 167, Ahold Delhaize USA 121. That's top 5, total 3.149 million employees. telling (Washington Post) spoke 3 million employees, said this? No? even 1 million? even 1,000? Probably even 100? Right.

This emotional pandering. Tell store's employees said this, tell many employees said this. Give actual examples said this. ""They even treat us like humans anymore"" something understand. defining that? mean give breaks? give time weekends? refuse let disinfect things? refuse space fellow employees apart? going on?

This right here: **Grocery workers say morale all-time low: ‚ÄòThey don‚Äôt even treat us like humans anymore‚Äô** utterly worthless sentiment. actually saying anything. Grocery workers could really mean single store interviewed 6 employees agreed one another single group. even treat us like humans anymore could mean anything subjective particular group like.

When younger lot friends worked local McDonalds. knew friends hated it. would complain. Complain work, disregard wanted, low pay, managers, business owner care, also friends worked exact McDonalds LOVED IT. Loved work, loved customers, loved management, loved felt treated, felt like pay perfectly fine (these teenagers here, plans going collage straight high school. One ended university professor PHD Chemistry, believe).

So interviewed friends hated McDonalds, boy bode well McDonalds, written like reddit post written, may bode well McDonalds!

Until interviewed friends loved it.

Now problem idea companies there, even individual stores suck myriad ways, post utterly worthless me. tells absolutely truths anything going besides subjective incredibly general idea grocery store employees treated... well, even know, way want treated?

I mean, want making 40K year currently am, guess could say I'm treated way want treated too, albeit fact already make do. they‚Äôre called ‚Äúbrave front line workers‚Äù ‚ÄúCOVID warriors‚Äù mask fact lives expendable like soldiers war.

Don't like retail ? go security guard make unlimited work pandemics. 

Don't like security, go get fork light license day, make double salary unlimited work practically pandemic.

People guess days can;t use brains expect everything handed them.   charged murder. like Covboys... disappointed grocery stores/workers treated COVID hit. basically took bunch minimum wage workers declared essential. Nobody making minimum wage considered ""essential"", ""essential"", pay quadrupled. wanted keep status quo, grocery store workers making $35 hour. we'd quickly see ""essential"" are.

What REALLY happened grocery stores completely converted pickup-only...no non-employees/vendors store. employees converted grocery pickers, shop orders customers. Charge customers $5-10 fee per order, 75% going employee 25% going pay ordering system. way minimize customer interaction (they're store touching everything), workers get extra money, get stay much safer.

We're make stupid mistake schools, opening up. Peoples' fetish physically things going kill tens thousands people COVID needed to. technology, we're even using it. like much choice, real pandemic plan place, hospitals severely lacking PPE ventilators, position handle pandemic spreading freely without shutting down. economy would still devastated without lockdown would deaths associated well. work restaurant. 25% capacity.  people choose eat inside give fuck.  They'll wear masks get door, never wear again. year Kroger couple years back, treat us like humans either... less explicitly worded. want sue another country, local courthouse? Canada keeps sending us cold air winter, think time pay crimes. wasn‚Äôt Republicans‚Äô response France voicing concerns measures rename french fries ‚Äúfreedom fries‚Äù? tells everything need know Drinking Lysol wont kill like rest.

I unaware big deal seeing post. Kenneth Copeland blew away live TV. Nothing worry folks 16-40. put perspective, yesterday, Ontario whole 33 new cases. Population: 15 million. Every company live signs saying mandatory masks. live Kentucky, Gov Beshear ordered masks required public. 

But Walmart, Lowes, restaurants actually enforce masks. Walgreens, McDonald's, gas stations, small shops lile dollar general, restaurants lile Subway, none give damm wearing mask. 

*Because they'd rather buy something.* dont care risk spreading disease. least gave money. 

So putting workers consumers harms way make buck still ever prevalent today then. Good. Vote.

Or taking back Paddy_Tanninger's comment kicked off: ""Gold **almost intrinsic value.** like paper electronic currency, thing gold; assigned value mutually agreed that.""

Itally death rate 10% health professionals health care workers. 

And teachers die, essential workers die.. still dont care..

160,000 deaths still going one cares. US could done NZ did, geography demographics. NZ followed protocol Vietnam worked stop local cases 99 days there. 

The NZ solution scaled simply involves everyone staying home businesses closing month. matter large population is, urban. virus cannot spread people interact all. 

The reasons US cannot partly cultural. population 90% comply lockdown. put community individualism accept authoritarian measures strip away basic freedoms. Americans simply willing accept that. 

The US also political reasons. Americans trust government enough. People faith politicians actually act best interest. NZ extremely high trust government. 

Finally US could key ingredient success acting early, almost community spread. NZ waited maybe 1 week March could late. Victoria, Australia waited 5 weeks longer introduce NZ measures. learn possible eliminate virus gets control. Victoria succeed perhaps US could even still follow NZ model. fail know acting early solution. 

Being island helpful keeping virus out, Vietnam kept 99 days despite common border China. Thailand done something similar. Can't believe forgot those. put UV inside body. force drink cure daily. fall long time coming covid exposing faster. anti intellectual culture essential brainwashing entire generations 20 30 years.

It‚Äôs either or, it‚Äôll take time people get used to, it‚Äôs probably one easiest things enforce school compared drugs, vapes, sex, cheating, yet don‚Äôt issue those. still debating this? common sense regards pandemic, ok. literally takes right now, half ounce common sense. Wear mask going well keeping distance others, wash hands frequently, stay home much possible, simple. Religious people gullible.

That's logic, all. cases, logic ignores actual odds favor merely pointing possibility risk

What? cases, wearing mask without knowledge infected asymptomatic carrier odds transmission. No, person found positive first time around symptomatic. imported case. Cool, make sure tell local police force services longer needed. health inspectors keep safe eating contaminated food. really don‚Äôt get it. basically population size demographics WI hit 1,000 deaths back end May got couple days ago.

Also, shouldn‚Äôt store mask contaminated viral particles capable infecting around neck.. seems you‚Äôre supposed wear gaiter around neck... that‚Äôs safe beg differ. 

Without actually wishing harm anyone, seems clear enough major world figure (especially one seem super old) dying COVID-19 would make hell lot easier convince people that, example, wearing mask really kinda important right now. idea animals social structures trouble you? superior, matter preacher tells you. looks like face small head ngl  Thanks article- think says dental office air exactitude millions offices people forced back into. disease isn‚Äôt going away.

One favorite quotes ‚Äúit says *outside* food, that‚Äôs keep food *inside* clothes!! What's article say? behind shitty paywall. Mexico one countries severely undercounting. Take look number tests per capita positive ratio. true number cases probably 20 times reported, consider 50,000 deaths, Covid case fatality rate 0.5-1%. Would say like sort highway, danger zone? actually need to. known problem. actually normal obese people. Vaccines less effective, immune systems struggle many situations. covid issue, herd immunity diseases makes less apparent.

It's likely phase 3 also includes weight obese, well. 200k excess deaths total, around 40k covid tally. Cashiers don‚Äôt want converse you. Pay shit leave . smoking gun quite yet, following reasons:

It's sad US become place informed denigrated.

But that's ended Donald Trump. many people look people take trouble inform themselves.

What's rationalization again? No. downvoted general masks worn public cannot filter COVID19. reduce distance COVID19 travel, ie, masks prevent WEARER mask spreading COVID19. scenario dont care about, person consider essential worker wearing mask actually danger.

This isnt us vs issue. screwed. honestly believe say anything pandemic, situation would better. Dude actively tweeting, talking misleading stuff times, frustrating hell watch someone powerful influential ignorant quarantine people home? could people checking delivering food them... actual punishments internment camps rule breakers. 

People quarantined homes tend react poorly believe government forcing something affects freedoms (Democracy you). even still continues spread.

You corona fatigue becoming problem people actively protesting masks social distancing.

Then got mental health problem growing quarantine avoid contact others.

You also economic problem: going pay check bring supplies? dealing reactivation/reinfection concerns, long someone stay indoors? long keep servicing them?

What community go lockdown ethnic background cry punishes people something outside control government cannot manage border adequately.

Again another symptom democracy, pretty much advertise open borders like Europe suddenly close them, political get upset protest crossing politicals wish touch.

China locked hard still struggle contain virus. outbreak Beijing places, outbreak north south. 

Even New Zealand reporting community cases.

Soft measures, virus spread, go hard start upsetting people virus still spreads. People becoming upset situation continues escalate.

There easy solution incompetancy power helping face lot shit matter do.

The way ends miracle vaccine. Nothing else. want resume international travel, like, *ever*. majority world eradicating virus. aren‚Äôt people arrested? called ""Doing New Zealand"". long costs millions run office, monied elites always able find people willing bidding. 

They change ways, they'll surround armed security. help stop spreading disease loved, yeah sure I'd fine that. Probably month anyway, likely 2 weeks. See, told provide evidence.

I'm psychic. make claim again, unable provide evidence... Middle-aged lady here, confirm. indeed love playful youngsters. No, like perverts, innocent playfulness. mean?

But I'll something ever dream doing. 

Apologize.

I'm sorry dick, I'm tired explaining pretty simple thing people level anti-intellectualism exists world today frustrating. anti-vaxxers anti-maskers climate change deniers. even frustrating I'm told I'm wrong one actually bring statistics. wonder much inbreeding contributes complications virus.

Put fucking mask Jackass there‚Äôs arbitrary line levels foolishness allowable ones aren‚Äôt?

I'm really surprised last 24 hours, NZ went golden child ""damn selfish Kiwis looking self-interests"" Sweden last couple months went ""everyone die there!!! grandma killers!!!!!!"" ""eh...perhaps lockdown wrong approach"".

The narrative truly changing. Bavaria MoE put plan week hygiene measures tailored infection levels. Ranges extended mask mandates half class total online incidence 50/100k/wk. Teachers tested every two weeks voluntary basis. Compliance high. Know several signed week. biggest problem see on/off nevertheless take virus seriously need send class home 1 mild cold symptoms, despite neg. testing.

Politicians stopped talking going back normal schools. preparing new normal seems quite reasonable do. works one knows. would c1-4 smaller classes every age group full remote.

NRW still good. Ddorf concert idea madness. Laschet needs get house order. also fear Eastern states. hardly hit behave like problem solved. Ramelow eyes especially bad job. Good ol' German tribalism aside happy to.live Bavaria. bars pubs still closed. one even dares talking opening them. Despite idiots ppl concerned since saw Lombardy getting overrun, closer us socially Northern Germany.

The great EU travel summer 2020 also proven bad idea. didnt get enough tourists really help southern countries. got enough virus back harm even more. Spain opinion need another lockdown go like this.

I fear school reopening might equally bad idea. 

I also see courts bad job. judge overruled Gesundheitsamt wanted close cannery longer judge deemed 'verh√§ltnism√§√üig'. Fed govt must limit power cases seem source simply idiotic decisions. (Which doesnt surprise look typical jurist country)

Good thing addition IfSG fed govt step matters get worse think Dr. Merkel Helge Braun sit idly province lords gonna ruin worked for.

But destruction hurt soul. √ñauph doubt anyone would consider Russian labs among leading labs world. Especially they‚Äôve accused hacking Americans Chinese. statistic leaps 40% positive test rate. That's telling testing nearly enough population have. Stanford medical Georgetown University medical said positive test rates 5 10% range indicate adequate testing proportionate overall population.

A lockdown alone cannot overcome inadequate testing lack contact tracing. think difficult judge lockdowns generally many factors matter whether mitigation plan effective. Virginia, we're still lockdown, we're still reasonably restrictive mode mandatory mask wearing (anecdotally, say suburban northern Virginia, mask wearing compliance least 90%) adequate testing, although contact tracing lagging. We've seen huge growth infections state.

My point is, can't judge lockdown Argentina we've done successful states US alone. judge across multiple measures. lockdown component successfully controlling spread virus. Jerry Jones moron. look decisions. night. SANITIZING PURCHASES - still advised disinfect items coming house purchased retail/grocery store? *Brazil's First Grandma Dies

Picklehead Ed? Funniest shit I‚Äôve ever seen. Haha always sang ‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt come out, don‚Äôt go in‚Äù movie "" Contagion"" realistic COVID19 , still differences.

So choices are:

1) it‚Äôs ok block people planes non-white

2) it‚Äôs ok make decisions might increase chances Covid spread plane small amount, we‚Äôre negotiating cases qualify don‚Äôt What's definition danger? still people dying higher rate neighbors believe. even follow much I've heard bunch people died lot them... started staying home social distancing brought numbers down. Imagine that. sure noticed, make dramatic changes bodies health.

You would surprised quickly immune system recover poor health. Even get 8 full hours sleep night previously poor sleep quality, would see dramatic increase ability body fight infections. think doctors recommend rest sick? 

No, going cure chronic disease like obesity diabetes 6 months (though could make big dent), someone major chronic issues, generally unhealthy lifestyle (eats junk, exercise morbidly obese, gets poor sleep, drinks much, etc), cutting things make dramatic difference weeks, months bodies health ability limit infections. simple relatively effective means helping prevent spread Covid

Who says instead of? think everyone saying ""in addition to"". quarantine they‚Äôre immune though? have. also typed proposal needs edited hoping convince Congresswoman turn proposed legislation would provide federal funds mandatory benefit packages School Staff time help protect them. BC Canada saying say distancing first useful thing do, good hygine, masks.

Don't stop distancing mask, choice must, avoid non distanced scenarios possible. that's students got tested. many students parents even bothering go get checked out. It‚Äôs fucking annoying.

Telling people forgo regular medical checkups terribly unwise. I'm going see dentist cleaning next week, feel like spending hundreds dollars fillings later road.

/s similar thought months ago. virus hit right time human history maximum damage. 80's, 90's? Get news watching news reading newspaper. There's need post everything right soon comes up, there'd time peer review things news picks up. 2000's? Internet still get news tv newspapers.  


That person believes earth flat 80's would never come publicly proclaim think flat know everyone around thinks round. Instead increasing knowledge internet made easier groups like minded individuals get together dumb together. That‚Äôs yesterday cases today 6000 something. It‚Äôs good rn let‚Äôs update information accuracy Sure, soon trust infected again. moment we're wanting even lovely Swedish neighbours visit! people like weaponized cringe Good. Would help look number manner? assume 1:2000 Americans die average every 3 weeks, looking last 3 weeks covid deaths (22,713 since July 22), new 3 week ratio 1:1757 american deaths 3 weeks. 

Math: 
168,275 (8/12) - 145,562 (7/22) = 22,713
1:2000 Americans = 164,120
3 week average deaths w/ covid: 164,120
3 week average deaths w/ last 3 weeks death: 186,833
328.24 Americans / 186,833 = 1756.86

I feel like sane person going indoor movie theater anytime soon. weird someone would go far call pain. difference negligible.

I also pretty socialable, mask little affect that. speak little louder communicate-not big deal. Okay, can‚Äôt smile strangers anymore. Also, big deal. Yeah, there‚Äôs differences small wouldn‚Äôt even call inconveniences, honestly. Let's put like - figures scientists made government look good, would shouting rooftops. fact manipulate data means things even worse. UK nonsense, people trust ""excess deaths"" government-massaged figures mysteriously wiped 5000 deaths total week. Excess Deaths much robust also includes people dying result unable get regular treatment hospitals collapsing Covid-19 - caused indirectly disease. sure. could use trillion dollars blank check Fed authorized conduct research better understand prevalence 'rona 

Sure, could'a done that! didn't! dictator United States power make fed suggested? No. Unfortunately system government state federal level best adapted quickly responding fluid situations this. also speaking place hindsight. honestly mean say government taking situation seriously back first began (or be) now?

No! president spitting BS like it'll blow spring time magically dissapear cases started explode first Northeast, nationwide. would congress senate, consisting many people who's thoughts line president, gung-ho using fed way suggested way back then?

They be, weren't. What's done done, unfortunately, either miracle competent administration takes over, currently Instead accurate prevalence information, know better worse countries based testing differences, dont know transmission rate. know prevelance needed herd immunity. know much transmitted schools every state closed schools end March U.S

Good point, often forget that. imagine varies state even county county clinic understaffed overworked test numbers update timely fashion (I know post graphs numbers). saying done maliciously either. bruh That‚Äôs worse, means whole state (30 million population) testing.

Background data SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence Africa though COVID-19 epidemic curve reported mortality differ patterns seen elsewhere. estimated anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence among blood donors Kenya. Methods measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG prevalence ELISA residual blood donor samples obtained April 30 June 16, 2020. Assay sensitivity specificity 83% (95% CI 59, 96%) 99.0% (95% CI 98.1, 99.5%), respectively. National seroprevalence estimated using Bayesian multilevel regression post-stratification account non-random sampling respect age, sex region, adjusted assay performance. Results Complete data available 3098 3174 donors, aged 15-64 years. comparison Kenyan population, sample over-represented males (82% versus 49%), adults aged 25-34 years (40% versus 27%) residents coastal Counties (49% versus 9%). Crude overall seroprevalence 5.6% (174/3098). Population-weighted, test-adjusted national seroprevalence 5.2% (95% CI 3.7, 7.1%). Seroprevalence highest 3 largest urban Counties; Mombasa (9.3% \[95% CI 6.4, 13.2%)\], Nairobi (8.5% \[95% CI 4.9, 13.5%\]) Kisumu (6.5% \[95% CI 3.3, 11.2%\]).

I'm glad seems like people taking seriously. familiar, viral RNA tests sensitive, identify dead virus easily forensic tests identify dead person. type virus phospholipid membrane encapsulates RNA injects cell. membrane breaks quickly, virus can't heal like living cell. viruses tougher.

A meaningful test would involve culturing virus living cells. [It proven virus survive days surfaces, temperature mean live virus every surface airport- 99% surfaces identified RNA testing probably dead virus.

Florida governor compares reopening schools coronavirus pandemic U.S. military raid killed Osama bin Laden

August 13, 2020 1:32 a.m. EDT

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) Wednesday compared difficulties reopening public schools 2020-21 academic year coronavirus pandemic obstacles faced U.S. Navy SEAL team killed Osama bin Laden 2011.

DeSantis, strong ally President Trump, made comment school districts state began process reopening in-person instruction. Florida major hotbed pandemic earlier summer, covid-19 rates remain high areas.

Nevertheless, DeSantis Education Commissioner Richard Corcoran pushed districts reopen, threatening withhold state funding districts offer remote learning without explicit permission administration. Corcoran participated White House event Wednesday Trump, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos speakers talked vital campuses reopen.


About 10 school districts Florida already begun in-person teaching, dozens set reopen next week. one elementary school Martin County, nine students quarantine home student showed covid-19 symptoms second day school, according TC Palm, news website.

DeSantis Wednesday gave brief address reopening schools noted Martin County Superintendent Laurie Gaylord told viewed reopening schools mission ‚Äúakin Navy SEAL operation.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust SEALs surmounted obstacles bring Osama bin Laden justice, would Martin County School system find way provide parents meaningful choice in-person instruction continued distance learning,‚Äù said, according transcript state government website. (Bin Laden killed compound Pakistan May 2011 team Navy SEALs U.S. Naval Special Warfare Development Group.)


DeSantis also said: ‚ÄúThe superintendent Suwanee County, Ted Roush, told never 26-year career witnessed saw first day school: parents bringing kids school, also bringing presents supplies teachers way say thank you.‚Äù

About half dozen Florida‚Äôs 67 counties planned offer remote learning high community covid-19 rates. DeSantis administration approved remote learning plans districts, including Miami-Dade Broward counties.

Hillsborough County‚Äôs school board voted last Aug. 6 open remotely, DeSantis Corcoran appeared Monday charter school county said charter schools could open in-person classes, could public schools.


From Aug. 5 Aug. 12, Hillsborough reported 2,001 covid-19 cases. That‚Äôs Orange County, 1,916 cases period given permission state reopen remotely.

Tanya Arja, spokeswoman Hillsborough school district, said district, covid-19 deaths rising, ‚Äúexplicitly followed state‚Äôs executive order‚Äù voted start remotely.

‚ÄúThe order provides school districts option opening brick mortar ‚Äòsubject advise orders Florida Department Health, (or) local departments health,‚Äô‚Äù said statement.

‚ÄúLast Thursday, school board made informed decision hearing local public health authority local infectious-disease experts,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúThe panel asked open doors one medical professional could recommend opening today. state‚Äôs order goes say day-to-day decision open close school always rests locally.‚Äù


But complicate matters, USA Today reported Friday local school districts initially told state officials needed local health departments approve reopenings, DeSantis administration told local health directors make recommendations districts provide information.

Requests comment Florida Department Health answered. Winter coming. whatever air popcorn. libruls got together planned pandemic, headed Australian left wing immigration centric party /s Bro headline 10th june. need scroll see going down. PLEASE MAN. 

And think TMC getting data from? TDSHS genius. Please man.

That random guys projections included CDC w/e.

Edited less offensive :) chicken kitchen counter I'm getting ready prepare, whether particular chicken deemed safe handle nothing infected, rather would part small number infected people large one? Karma get soon. wait. can‚Äôt believe time still people don‚Äôt understand virus affects people differently

I can't believe actually think think flu affect people stated 12% drop national death toll due COVID-19, proves uncertain times 

Don't put words mouth. drop happened people handling numbers incompetent. Mask + good eyebrows incredible Broadway closed rest year, Movie theaters same. I'm jealous, lol. Georgia closed super late first reopen. I'm actually pretty lucky - husband lose jobs lot confidence persist. company reasonable zero expectation us go back office time soon. husband office almost every day since april, though.. 

I sat restaurant since early March (get delivery though, fine), friends since time - used see couple times week more. huuuuge sports fan, though, hoped visit several mlb parks year (went 2 non-home parks last year great). Wanted try see first ever hockey game. looks like college football out, too, least be. 

I wish could taken seriously done right way could much closer are, kind normal. love it. skim past customary disclaimers appease certain folks, hear echoes I‚Äôve saying since April. reporter must buzzing getting make title one remember interview virologist speculated minimum viral load infection could low thousand virons, someone expels 100 virions breath max shedding, means ten breaths near person might enough reach infectious dose. 30 seconds, less breathing heavily.

There one case China person one building got merely sharing stair well another person sick. never met face face, going stairs sick made breathe *very* heavily, stair well ventilation, viral particles just.... hung hours. someone else huffing way staircase 30 minutes later inhaled stagnant air. No, still get methanol poisoning absorbing skin. wildly irresponsible jump conclusion deaths normal assumed Covid deaths.

This sub absolutely appalling fear mongers without practicing real discipline all. Cool, places experienced massive deaths tanked economy. Lol sorry getting family sick isn‚Äôt worth minimum wage, customers didn‚Äôt give shit health safety made depressed. actually really loved job hard decision leave. see, Muslims, bad. unkind remark, based evidence kind. I‚Äôm interested learn virus behaves! can‚Äôt wait research conclusive studies later road! death rate among children infinitesmal, far lower regular flu. shut schools did, would school, we'd go back stone age. America might worst hardly alone. 

In July, August cases going pretty much everywhere except Sweden New Zealand (notable exception last days). 

I blame confused strategy places implemented. effective, incomplete lockdowns (happy meals tax lawyers apparently life death service) failed irradicate virus like New Zealand (neither happy meals lawyers essential service list) 

This followed confused reopening strategy. virus still community spreading let's reopen cause population done pandemic lockdowns cost much.

We reopened everyone fed lockdowns started party cases went up. failed Sweden marathon sprint approach well. What's bloodtype? I'm amazed governors getting away scot free issue. think know Abbott DeSantis suck lot reasons, ridiculous reason gets ignored people.

We'll know death rates states numbers finally return normal, need sure late labs finally report backlogs wait till Florida Texas report probable deaths (or subtract New York) furin cleavage site clear, colorful 3-D modeling illustration explanation also location scrolling article. *eating animals wrong ....covid* quarantined places like diamond princess. examples nearly everyone close, indoor contact contracted virus. 

It's also strange half people t-cells make someone immune, spreads easily. truly gave immunity, START fairly close herd immunity, doesn't' mesh see all. 

Also, children get tested high rate. think say get virus. nice let international flights continue walled Hubei. Stop butt chugging hand sanitizer! weird... Paywall pls help mean *if*? playing *September* one point.

And wonder streaming radio become dominant. every station owned multimedia conglomerate plays top 40 hits pushes 30 renditions 5 bland pro-consumerism Christmas songs rotation mid-August, bet ass I'll pay $10 Pandora, Spotify, Apple, Google anybody else offering chance *never listen shit again!* second part wrong. China make daily decisions country. That's job leadership failed. can‚Äôt look impact ‚Äújust virus‚Äù‚Äôin isolation. things won‚Äôt happen based either virus response it.  open everything ""if dies, dies"" already? understand many people becoming drug addicts killing isolation torture. I'm single, got family etc I'm completely alone....... Like lol already. It'll probably kill I'd rather risk death spend another year two isolation cell. ...anytime year ^anytime ^of ^year find here. actually completely safe. ewe factor ingrained people Winning! Gotta double stupidity. They'd rather take extreme longshot it'll work versus getting owned libs. stopped SARS vaccine disappeared quickly appeared. linked tourists accounted for? Masks help much. social distancing, loose weight, live healthier life. focusing masks killing lot people. China truly seeing reinfections, would put numbers question. 

With reported numbers, chance someone catching twice ridiculously low shouldn‚Äôt even considered. 

And supposedly one multiple reinfections? Couldnt read angry comment, sorry. know morons like embarrassment rest us, right? Agree regarding point sterility, largely entire comment. must wear surgical masks PAPRs procedure. trying provide insight question regarding American‚Äôs policy covering exhaust ports elastomeric exhaust valves aren‚Äôt different exhaust port N95, i.e, unfiltered exhaled air, respirator wouldn‚Äôt circumvent rule. Bingo think so. still don‚Äôt think understand tone trying convey, though. seems like aggressive disbelief me, must missing something, don‚Äôt understand aggression. 

Sorry, I‚Äôm trying difficult here; I‚Äôm trying understand choice words. I‚Äôm offended , full shit that‚Äôs added eye roll. point stands, then. üëçüèº Rubbing alcohol 70-something% variety good. Hand sanitizer good. bleach, mix leave house use regular bleach. surface cleaners though, needs applied liberally allowed dry. 90% alcohols dry quickly effective 70%.

It's quicker job use glove bag touch pump, throw away after. Unless mind wait minute two. heated discussion co-worker back March. claimed would go away heat summer. thought virus/infection died fever thus 100F summer hits we'll good. Home Brewer know 150F minimum killing micro-organisms. explaining falsehood go research, basically said I'm full shit.

I'm actually optimistic could open world sooner vaccine candidates made now. stripped privileges like driving, purchasing alcohol, cigarettes, voting, know...like child. less tests? seems stupid. work vaccine manufacturer. labs can‚Äôt get supplies either multiple programs re-prioritized order optimize tastings. time alive.... Sure Mine closed two weeks. I‚Äôm IA work. go CO beginning next month. Yay. actually think ending vote mail would hurt him, especially pandemic, elderly less likely vote person unemployed time world wait line.  Even CDC aren‚Äôt claiming 100 percent excess deaths due C-19. Seems like bad life choice. run non-zero chance dying COVID, think medical science ever attributed death watching Smash Mouth live. (I could wrong.) Students teachers still get infected eventually long schools still open. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes Hopefully fade away orange jumpsuit matching spray tan, Rikers, buddies mean 1917? flu ended WW2? tell americans neither party gives fuck you. funny/sad thing happening/coming weeks yet people commenting seem surprised like first they're hearing it. department lead test positive COVID-19. exposed day shifts, majority night shift. exception work her. found Wednesday back next Monday.

Pissed beyond anything.  Europe. bars restaurants. new outbreaks worth speaking about. make sure frozen foods safe. Wipe foods wipes? don‚Äôt find logic entirely convincing. don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs good response scientific discussion comparing academic studies. 

But studies show work. don‚Äôt really understand good discussion published studies differing conclusions. That's okay. Young people going inherit insolvent Social Security anyways.

Toss pile of, ""Looming crises younger people."" find rug there. remember place rug back top put there. comes virus feel like don‚Äôt know... get Malta Netherlands from?

EDIT: nvm, Sky News: gov.uk announcement: I'm entirely sure, would think educator fairly easy chance getting hired elsewhere. know might explain left, health issues sounds reasonable. getting rid virus Long Trump office going hell get rid already trying dismantle post office safe way mail vote year fair even instacart, people shopping fucking morons annoyingly slow.

imagine walking around like ""uhhhh hmmm""...the store keeps shit place, know want regular route pick up, well knowing products generally worth ignore stupid ""50 percent off!"" value perception manipulation stickers.  don‚Äôt think suggesting don‚Äôt celebrate deaths hundreds people obnoxiously self-righteous. It‚Äôs fairly common viewpoint outside Reddit.... people also deserve jail time. Damn. stories tell? really look currupt I‚Äôve seen plenty videos Karens government spewing BS. sorry guys Even white male perquisites caste, stressful days lashed innocents frustrated me. Give break. Yet. NOT. GROCERY STORES. WEIRDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD feels like government policies written Covid-19 itself.

I feel guilty laughing this. Nah didn‚Äôt cases random rural family got sick nobody else around did. frozen packaged food that‚Äôs idea came from. strict even undetected cases, wouldn‚Äôt spread like right now. elsewhere?  Fear weakens immune system dramatically. Amen mean... Technically right ... joining rest nation.  Notre Dame already 19 cases campus even done first week classes. Expect headlines outta ND soon. No. article doesn‚Äôt timeline right. Sounds like order issued got sick, judge didn‚Äôt know, issued must enforced. lot room anyone delay, absent judicial approval delay. Terrible circumstances. Sorry take science first approach masks. want show academic paper shows combined value N95 valved mask worse public health cloth mask I'll change position. I'll use common sense assume 95% protection person wearing fact exhaled air directed wearers feet instead front face still going way better porous cloth mask. mention easy modify mitigate valve wish that. Seems stupid ignore ton available PPE supposedly experiencing shortage. heard Florida Man? He's real. without covid, states never go lockdown, everyone get medical needs taken care of. missing?  cool! targeting testing towards sick may come contact sick. going report cases higher % cases states test random slices population. wait mean that. Yeah, it‚Äôs tough situation, one hand it‚Äôs easy wag finger bars restaurants hotspot outbreaks, hand many situation don‚Äôt open simply going lose everything close forever

It‚Äôs us work home jobs suddenly forced type one hand, actually going get paid 1/2 usual salary, months actually going get paid zero, told come back work handcuffed again, told less week later fired 

I might take risks wouldn‚Äôt normally take situation

I think leaves bad taste mouth most, politicians voted bailout banks 2008 ‚Äútoo big fail‚Äù ones like, ‚Äúsorry small businesses already given everything can, what‚Äôs that, went huge corporations? Oh well, sorry, you‚Äôre small us care‚Äù 

Hopefully voters affected hypocritical decisions remember whose side people really Deep cleanse ( Õ°~ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) Round 2! 1500 deaths today America

Half 9/11

Its guys! get bonus money someone deadpool dies? find hard believe nurses would behave like institution. Fortunately adequate PPE, perhaps fact I've worked ICU thinking said unbelievable. really. vaccine applied near universally residents 18-60 effective enough get Rt &lt; 1, time infectious residents spread Covid19 elderly.

In much way public health tolerate small minority vaccinate children measles. number grows beyond threshold, measles spread throughout unvaccinated groups.

If vaccine serious adverse effects elderly, may reasonable focus early vaccinations demographic groups likely spread disease. first, rate. Also 350 million estimate end pandemic whereas 800k half-baked official tally (that's pretty low) middle first wave pandemic. 



You really get I'm going go extremes here.

We 800k (rounding up). Let us say somehow world literally caught 1/3 COVD-19 deaths. 1.6 MILLION deaths last 6 months missed.

That 2.4 million.

Let us say pace death DOUBLES 2.4 million die every 3 months.


Follow?


So given 2 totally absurd propositions.


But let's go it.

Now let's say scenario continues 6 YEARS.


At end 6 years would be........only 17% way death toll 1918 Spanish Flu.

Do see criminally stupid idea comparing 2 is? think dropping testing wait time results atrocious

Yup. Harris County (Houston) 7-9 days I've people come still without results delays. There's new agreement ""drive sites"" fed/state/private partnership promising 3-5 days requires samples shipped Texas California. 

I'd make sense state takes twice long shipping coast Mulan exclusive Disney Plus wherever available, hit single theater US. crazy fast goes. took nearly 4 months get first 2.5 million cases. took 6 weeks get next 2.5 million cases. wisdom teeth Navy boot camp, fuckers believe could still feel everything doing. 

Wound injuring hands/arms gripping chair tight. God forbid someone active social life... outside. Oh horror! sun burns pale redditor skin! Hmmm I‚Äôm red headed well gotten C-19(yet) maybe you‚Äôre onto something Although article suggests Swedes ‚Äúlocked down‚Äù voluntarily, mobility data tells different exactly would expect see. like government rules, mobility changes someone lightest there. Restaurants caf√©s open parts world right now. They're also open Europe, going second wave moment. **SEC entered chat* guy Johan Carlson general director FHM Tegnells boss. said first press conference mars 6:

""It judge pandemic spread. pandemic deal with.""

And Tegnell press conference:

""This manageable, continuous spread Sweden unlucky different ways.""

We unfortunately talentless officials Sweden. It‚Äôs literally eenie meenie miney mo. I‚Äôve seen people totally disregard social distancing get sick (yet guess) people try best end catching (and thankfully recovered). Yup still family well. Idk laugh hard comment. feel truly sorry happens thou. Seriously!  
  
'Not pleased' diplomatic way discribe shitshow.  
Man I'm still laughing.... sorry!  
Edit: Meanwhile Senate going vacation. Terrorists? contact tracer contact people test positive, attempt determine everyone person contact determine needs informed situation. I‚Äôm talking employees. also people get sick. Combined know industry works ‚Äúif don‚Äôt cover shift you‚Äôll suspended‚Äù etc etc. even know places local mall (where work at) hiding cases employees guise ‚Äúconfidentiality‚Äù. People afraid report positive tests don‚Äôt want lose job unsure market. places literally threatening report EDD refuse work. Many health insurances tied jobs. I‚Äôm sorry selfish need dine shouldn‚Äôt overrule peoples health. get people need work line work anti supposed effectively combat this. clearly misunderstanding seem arguing reason. There‚Äôs easy solution problem, acting like isn‚Äôt problem isn‚Äôt spread restaurants abhorrently ignorant, whether among wait staff, back house, customers. wonder happen saw thumbnail thought picture person assaulted , lady looks like dude. way things going America... family would mortal danger said that. US doomed point. Everything corrupt polarized. nowhere go down. honest advice almost anyone start looking leaving, even takes 10 years. can't fix stupid. Find new roommates. Thanks, Mitch... corona virus loves 2 things, dense population dense population. what's plan? walk infected around disney world, get tested 3 5 days tell got it? disney trying do? count many stupids infected?

and realy employees tests? sounds good Interesting. I've taking Coral calcium supplement least last couple years. addition calcium, vitamin magnesium supplements. hope that's enough. go again!  day?? side effects really last week, especially stomach/bowel issues. Maybe related vaccine? Everyone corona needs know self quarantine.  even man eating tigers politics... pulled CDC data Excel directly compare dates, compared data Worldometer dates.

 May dates may 3-30, worldometer 2784, CDC 2556 attributed Covid, 3117 excess deaths average causes. Pretty close right?

In June 1-27, Covid deaths worldometer:1040, CDC: 894, overall excess deaths 1781. Okay, starting see 80-100% excess deaths. 

June 28-aug 1: covid deaths worldometer: 689, CDC:655, overall excess deaths 3884! 

Overall, CDC 7971 covid deaths, Worldometer 7289 reported period, obviously mismatch date deaths reported. biggest difference deaths attributed Covid 1077 higher May CDC compared Worldometer, presumeably CDC accurate dates actual mortality compared publically reported 

Btw, total excess deaths overall Aug 1 13343.

We expect deaths peaks underreported testing facilities overwhelmed. there's really good reason thousands deaths misdiagnosed factor 10 time there's 10-20 deaths reported day. likely reason think (?) would policy change use Covid code anymore keep numbers low. expect happen democratic governor, know much PA politics. Yes really consequences virus seems like Punnett square matrix depending person. people variations symptomatic/asymptomatic, spreader/noncontagious, highly susceptible/high threshold contraction. seems like China got right testing people virus, also taking temperatures constantly, also chest scans detect lung-infiltrates. I‚Äôm tired winning crime?

Well... thing got stick resisting arrest... Ah yes, know airbags natural enemy stock exchanges. Bloodbath currently happening georgia. Still mask mandate. Weird! don‚Äôt know would thing would happen*. know least vaccine trials using different vaccine placebo.

*although theories certainly vaccines may already protect Covid19 may One brightest silver linings whole pandemic leaps bounds progress made researchers doctors around world, many focused set inter-related issues time, much shared other. put piece tape valve

Then longer valve. article misinformation? keep going thread... look data man. don‚Äôt buy kids don‚Äôt get sick theory reopening like education minister Quebec saying - would considered spreading miss information according global health experts. Everyone entitled opinion. ignoring science stupid. Schools closed soon open. post back do. Time tell. one child getting sick, long term health effects reported, worth it. one tell child risk pandemic ridiculous. yeah half backed measures ALLLl back fired Quebec around world. Instead lines like ‚Äúwe alright‚Äù proof sources suggest that, none. backfired backfire. looking facts ignorance. keep great üëç contributions getting sense anti mask campaign. Quebec making huge mistake / gamble safety kids - like north Paulding high school. Corona shaping cure planet earth. argued otherwise?

You moron saying 'facebook mirror'. me. reddit mirror too? actual glass mirrors?

Cool heard someone use phrase spewed back mindlessly. Less cool made fucking sense. pain ass, I'm redhead natural, count? Asking friend. Hard hide death numbers tho... That's clever. use paper towels pitch use hand sanitizer get home thorough hands washing. things like gas, stores, etc. I'm also beers driving mask on. way way home I'm unconsciously touching face something. wish could upvote reddit breaks. 19th per capita. He‚Äôs also amused. Disney publicly traded company. would illegal act best interests shareholders. 

If right thing close money made, shareholders could sue them. I've even seen people saying infected asymptomatic oxymoron, sick symptoms! Arizona Florida West  live long enough, get chance 180 again. dad 96, he's nicest he's ever life (was tough younger). really believes every day gets wake good one.  üíú missing point. 675,000 Americans estimated die 1918 Influenza epidemic seems extreme. relative rate influenza deaths high back 1915-1917 2.0 per 1000. compare 1918 (6.0 per 1000) extreme change baseline mortality rate. look total deaths one year bubble seems bad. overall control bacterial viral infections sucked 1918. People died random infections time. 

In 2020 that's case. we're seeing mortality numbers infectious disease 6-7x baseline already. That's much severe change. Sure overall number per capita may get 1918 (probably won't) baseline start high either. SARS-CoV-2 around 1918 would MUCH MUCH worse today. I'm worried reason lockdowns pushed whitehouse saving late November.

Is covid used american political strategy? Paywall. silencing doctors discovered it? Using establish South China Sea? Starting fuckin thing first place? LPT: knock people without warning experience fear attack beforehand "" week dozens infections school.""

Probably like hundreds learn passive aggressive whiner, eh?

 

Weird. also think things start improving winter. Science really amazing. Imagine case 15 years ago, we‚Äôd fucked. We‚Äôre lucky sooner later, also think we‚Äôre lucky two three candidates got huge headstarts vaccines. bar restaurant 6 months. I've take burger place bit unwelcoming chairs tables stacked. even worried take well since many people handling food. least buying food grocery store, food stored hours days assume virus dies. Yes, positive cases less testing. bar restaurants shut spread then?

because lockdown spiked everywhere, matter fact i'm pretty sure higher spikes across globe lockdown lockdown?

whose got figures - looking forward seeing discussing That's anti mask people called warning what's happening right now. 

I've predicted pandemic step step.  actually waste 89% tests testing people yet know positive.

Then test 11% positives again, get 100% positive those, least tests get wasted. bother. usually need test designed specific epitope vaccine targeting for. Genuine question here. finding active, transferable virus surfaces could lead infection? Or, finding traces viral RNA still present overtly dangerous?

Laymen trying keep smart.  Ah yes, luckily flawless testing program tells us perfect accuracy when. potential gym users acting incomplete info, rational America!

Does smooth brain help move faster? make aerodynamic run gym's treadmill swap fluids fellow rational big boys? Exactly thoughts. 2000 healthcare professionals Georgia recently signed petition sent Kemp, basically begging please implement measures health officials recommending Good points.

The thing understand minorities impacted much terms poverty.

This seems disease lifestyle. Yet thought hispanics south asians eat pretty well. Every meal home cooked. thought supposed better us processed shit many rest us eat. scaled years life lost 1918 pandemic ~100x current numbers covid. medical care lot better doubt factor, looking deaths Sweden/Amsterdam (anywhere 500 deaths/million) trickled 0, seems unlikely covid pandemic come close magnitude 1918 pandemic even taken countermeasures. depend immunity lasts though (we know lasts 6 months far, hopefully much longer) look closely (although actually recommend that) see actually wearing mask pants. Congratulations that's excellent goals! I've heard positive things breathing exercises. I've heard rough first necessary help fight. great see pushing improving goals! That's super awesome, keep fighting good fight! say people follow measures, one point failed. Every person sort involuntary movement habit sometimes registered recorded memory. Many nose itch, eye rubbing, even face scratching.

You may negative, colleague messed point know it. can‚Äôt steal election moving Russia. Vai de PLM! due respect, scientist first, seems forced, good conscious, speak out. definitely aren‚Äôt getting scientific presentation Dr. WH, would hearing Dr. Fauci didn‚Äôt try speak out. opinion. Yeah understand would use chart try demonstrate point shows literally opposite title calls question veracity entire article. Low quality post. What's point? you‚Äôre way stupid. Probably? there's international border, folks cross ""illegally"". Either way, also borers countries US does. we're really concerned try making pact giving medical + financial aid Central America Mexico also keep lid outbreaks Yes stop spread. put piece tape valve wear surgical mask it. 

Stop spreading misinformation. Brown‚Äôs still planning students campus, dorms, classrooms üò£ know Chinese spread virus reservations.

Every country contain spread virus country. looks like China amazing job. Spray Lysol? seen Lysol spray since pandemic started. Edited Titles hoax idiots say end November (right election, say experience like 2018 caravan).

Meanwhile Russia claims vaccine, China likely second given effort (trying both, proven methods cutting edge). We, hand, ignored proven methods put money vaccines, used before. Even president changes take quite unf*k this. necessarily ‚Äúlinked‚Äù, occurs populations get equator.

Cooking food help contamination came packaging Dang it. Sigh. can't nice things. ~~day~~ year, might seem strange. ‚ÄúI really don‚Äôt care. u?‚Äù Again, correct. That's 6% population! Lol sub never fails disappoint. Spanish Flu killed .8% US population time Covid killed .05% date. Unfortunately, grocery work always essential - ask grocery worker state snows hurricanes. grocery store operate skeleton crew? Absolutely, someone still needs throw truck someone still needs operate register. 
As grocery worker nearly entire career we've always treated like trash public, we're heroes working hurricane rush, particularly bad snowstorm... we're trash again. different, except, know, lives stake longer. much longer. feels like never going end, really. Right sorry unclear agreeing :) much precarious budget situation... Yes many decisions taken might political ( knowledge political landscape NZ) since want attract voters hopefully decisions beeing made best interest people eventough might different various countries show really effective. stop testing altogether, confirmed cases fight pamdemic won!  (/s....just case) Sister came home sick weeks ago. next day mom sick, day sister's boyfriend sick. tested positive. sister fever, cough, body aches days symptoms went away. feels fine gets drained usual work. boyfriend extremely sick week half better. mom extremely sick (vomiting, body aches, shortness breath, diarrhea, sense taste smell) three weeks go ER.

They're thinking sister's boyfriend spreader hard tell got sick sister. shit sucks. may part it. However lot factors school spending goes towards including paying land buildings outside donor contributions, maintaining classrooms, auditoriums, fields, offices, grounds, lesser salaries,etc. mention need instructors handle students enrollments increase new programs added others modified. Maintaining bookstore, campus security measures. There's lot. increase university spends means get additional funds somewhere. Unfortunately students foot bill. top chain people earn disproportionately more? I'm sure, gap likely varies school school district district. Yeah, normalcy gonna back sooner later. sorry ironclad evidence intentional misleading unintentional misleading whatever purpose heard created

I didnt say anything ""intentional misleading"". guidelines instruct doctors list Covid, even assumed *contributed* (not caused) death, agreed?

So look certificate page 5.

You someone died Pneumonia.

As co-morbidities heart disease, diabetes, COPD.

""Suspected Covid"" gets listed cause death.

So counted Covid death, right?

So would lead doctor code suspected covid death, hasnt positive test? 

Im sure reason kind. Maybe person came nursing home cases? dont know. dont know could lead doctor assume Covid contributed death hadnt positive test.

But .. guess assume 100% assumptions correct?

There mistakes made? see done sake correctly estimating data spread find hot spots. 

Right. seems like general approach ""Better safe sorry. suspect Covid might played part death, Code Covid. Interests public health important medically correct matter.""

Dont agree seems message there? state full people take ""physician, heal thyself"" literally. weapon called evangelism. Abuse respect religions get country huge threat democracy. Literally ignoring fact one servers cooks potentially sick, sneezed something touched plate you‚Äôre eating; you‚Äôre exposed. Yeah risk exposure contact surfaces low many hours minutes - especially highly contagious disease seems be. ‚Äúirrational paranoia‚Äù need therapist want reduce amount contact. Especially unnecessary action going eat cook shit home. almost definitely dangerous Europe, hard say scared comparison, think need paranoid. city Atlanta, afaik, still mask mandate right now, think gatherings also limited. (I live suburbs 10 minutes Atlanta, rules apply live) advice careful airport, since around lot people enclosed building. know multiple TSA agents hartsfield-jackson ave tested positive COVID-19 past couple months, they'll enforcing masks social distancing lowers risk lot.

The biggest reason spread bad right people completely ignoring advice healthcare officials taking precautions. see anyone wearing mask social distancing, stay far away person okay.  lockdowns increase child abuse domestic violence. don‚Äôt get people concerned even testing, alright think done tests country world, trying outdo here? We've showing world total shit show LEAST three years. wonder much extra 600 13 week ui extension ended. know personally job isnt back yet, wont quite sometime (audio engineer live events) UI ended commenting going back school all. maybe soccer could get better foothold US.

One point comment though, makes think people college campuses access healthcare home? experience Sardines super food ever one. Fascism, really? know downvotes internet don‚Äôt regulate life, right? one easy- stay away Grandma. new. distinctly remember first 36 years life COVID feeling well, see grandma.

If Grandma happens worker, social safety net place continue get wage without exposed public.

instead, paid 28 year olds sit home. 2/3 population lives capital medical professional, housewife- almost sounds like (reading info) virus trigger auto-immune response body similar lupus multiple sclerosis. immune system suppressed degree steroids treat symptoms? (Very simplified theory/question). Correct I‚Äôm wrong isn‚Äôt 19% positivity like REALLY HIGH See that‚Äôs I‚Äôm confused never said ANYTHING chef sneezing food spreading food. Go back read previous comments. Surely see I‚Äôm confused you‚Äôre questioning logic.

So you‚Äôre telling whole argument god damned nonpoint assumed talking foodborne transmission mentioned word ‚Äúchef‚Äù? Thanks that. That‚Äôs dumb reason.... don‚Äôt think anybody saying lose weight drop emotional/financial/all sorts issues got person situation overnight. done. might cross T-cell immunity infected different coronavirus past. System working intended wanted provide context. threw 180k number without linking source, that's one me. excerpt:

Taken together, emerging data suggest surgical masks N95 alternatives continue keep clinicians health care workers safe. Yea daddy talk dirty me. love quickly put misogyny hat found woman! Love us. used metrics big software program development. management always would ask top tweak things prior presenting charts top three customer.  little things, like... put bug reports overall count part program finalized yet. Etc.

The client thrilled progress. came testing time. program blue screened multiple times disaster.

Point is, hide data going catch sooner later much devastating addressing problem first crops up.  follow Japanese guidelines American, theyve wearing masks since started Goodness, actually said that? in-laws claim he‚Äôs great job gladly point out.

To long delays test results great indication terribly handled, along surges deaths many places. put cheap surgical mask allowed fly valve? lot people suffering alcoholism badly get hard alcohol they'll drink anything. Mouthwash used common one. Good point. true test would look memory T-cells seem last much longer. However, understanding much difficult costly run. laughed. cried. Haha, bank clerk training. Poor Germany. NYC Dept Health swarming specific areas city upticks cases--they trying test everyone communities, helping people quarantine people cooperating contact tracing. American cities that.

The places name handling public health correctly. surges eventually recede--not randomly reopening based idea herd immunity. 

 
EDIT clarify: dispute connection NYC experience herd immunity. risk dying car accident lifetime estimated 1%, perspective. people tough time grasping statistics, percentage generalizing death rate across extremely diverse group people bit useless. youngish reasonable healthy, covid low list things likely kill you, statistically speaking Colleges already opening US fall, yeah fine spring. scare early strange starting towards end August unusual. dancer? They're untrustworthy dangerous humans. Honestly, call evil.

Greed ingrained people make questionable choices time. I've seen seemed good people become heartless exploit profit.

Maybe always awful. see it. helps remember, case, people gotten chance show true colors depths. numbers looking at? According healthdata.org, AZ numbers likely peaked early Wow, that's striking difference PCR-vs-seroprevalence I've seen.

Canada's seroprevalence studies far found antibody rate 3 4 times PCR rates, 10-fold. really hard look beyond front see bigger impact things go badly wrong? many people incapable viewing bigger picture?

Worked leading hospital country student researcher, across departments. lots heads departments rocked, knew one would threaten fire student workers come work sick. particular study worked extremely ill folks could've easily killed common cold. time I've straight walked job quit. 

Even people understand disease spread susceptible ignoring knowledge favor capitalist mindset work bone, even means risking people's health. know (or point) coworkers bosses insist working sick making others work sick? Medical facilities too. people hear vitamin protect COVID-19, lot people pound Vit way hard. That's lot people are. 

Hell, people drinking bleach. months back CDC actually put statement ""unlikely"" spread via surface contamination. common knowledge ""germs"" spread (and studies indicating long Covid estimated survive surfaces) made skeptical surfaces suddenly safe. CDC flip flopped common sense precautions since day one. I'm it. I'm going continue protect others conventional ways taught since children! (No harm come overly cautious, would CDC encourage lowering simple precautions? makes sense me.) always high, flu death rate high. Severe cases lifelong lasting effects even rarer. important remember reality situation get emotional like sub does. know exactly explain get sick.

That beard important health.

This risk management situation. choosing riskier path vanity perfectly capable safer thing.

But believ anything doctor says without checking source studies arereferencing, doctor going blow mind demon sperm. researched factor really huge factor. couple percentage points one way terms severity symptoms. certainly points towards antigenic factors include waaay A/B important, A/B/O poor predictor severity. seeing hateful comments towards fat people personally? thing understand still planning send kids back school despite ongoing outbreaks. link school opening plan Canada, province province. Ontario, schools open, want kid school, provide remote learning. I'll bet surprising kids actual school come September. Correct. pro-business narrative paints distorted picture, course. think/say GDP state mandated shutdowns. Economists seem generally know better, maybe cuz dont ""horse race."" Yet last night. Guess actually work out! viable virus found blood, transmitted body, could possibly source positive tests meat. 

I keep talking blood original topic first statement topic rebuttal. 

I‚Äôm definitely MD, never said was, it‚Äôs obvious pun Dr. Octopus. we‚Äôre topic names, 13 year olds Xbox gamertag, maybe it‚Äôs time grow up. draw line minimizing amount people die gasping air lungs full fluid. Sound exactly like something would suppress ""lose face."" Yes agree. Past tense wrong, looking forward, see bolsters point even more. Sweden‚Äôs excess deaths actually normal range right now, countries draconian approaches seeing resurgences. Good her! We're repeating last week. lot people never learn lesson first place, much less forget period time. Iraq?

Really, thats answer? assuming 30 40 million people would get lockdown. Hard find evidence prove that.

You say there‚Äôs way telling many gonna die anyways, don‚Äôt understand that‚Äôs true covid also? agree point obesity mainly due people's choice food lifestyle habits, 100 years ago people disabilities cause obesity regardless lifestyle factors probably died could live long enough become obese since medical technology limited.   Teachers refuse in-class teaching. deflection tactic, targeted one. tons articles online. Flus large going cause kind panic already infrastructure develop vaccines target specific strains. honestly wish people would stop comparing flue virus. radically different, despite similar visible symptoms, case, HIV. realize zero hedge, chart real

60 million people die year planet btw Yeah same, takes much time wipe down. lysol spray ran out, wash hands touching groceries first days arrives work night club ? non traditional sense yes. 

From anecdotal evidence friend OD‚Äôd back April, it‚Äôs addicts tougher situation, it‚Äôs quality drugs coming worse. columbus Ohio OD numbers skyrocketed. Almost every one reported due fentanyl laced drugs (and I‚Äôm talking heroin users). 

It‚Äôs shitty situation. demand even prevalent, supply getting harder too. happens? People cut corners, trickle effect random people die due bad stuff. Oh god realized morons going think 5ghz band 5G. 99% time steps could taken sides prevent situation, let's pretend police's fault. think NBC news someone piece this. One seniors quoted saying something like ""We're willing take risk senior year always wanted.""

I'm like, so...having ""fun"" senior year worth long-term health risks spreading disease parents teachers, may die disease?

Even kids Lies. Go back in-person school said cdc ""months"" ago. teacher, RN, emergency-room doctor, retail worker, restaurant worker, delivery person, care provider

Isn't delivery work solitary time, meet people small amount daily time? Whereas retail restaurant work, meet continouus stream people. probably plays golf much likes seeing card full 10s! rushed untested vaccine endorsed Trump's CDC/NIH? Yeah that's gimme me. Yeah Ruffles stole cookies Girl Scout, impersonated lobster, 27 children five different fathers, and, according one local doctor, worms.  lack soul don‚Äôt know science isn‚Äôt settled yet Yes, society whole. 99.5% whole close enough.

Also disagree notion acts intentions, effects, relevant. 100% stoicism, I'm 100% stoic. Well dumb relative term. can‚Äôt say Americans dumb without sort reference point. Chimpanzees dumb compare humans, smart compare slug.

I American, spent years 5 countries 4 continents, don‚Äôt notice anything exceptionally stupid Americans compared places. 

In fact google ‚Äúnations intelligence‚Äù check wiki, see USA upper third countries. I'm trying claim plan may still effect (at least minor) herd immunity regardless. Still dubious covid higher mortality rate approach would much worse. Absolutely, we're medical field instances rare enough brought often. honestly think information spread well medical professionals likely want panic people generally impact, stuff aware of. There's difference aware education going full panic mode. Seeing thing patients hospital. aren‚Äôt symptomatic all. thought dead virus triggering positive test. handful test positive testing positive March. don‚Äôt think newsworthy asymptomatic. virus stable freezing temps. NZ thought reinfected eradication. Chicken, Brazil. Seafood, China. difference. China ties publicly shames parading streets. Yea, millions work, forced stay home, else do... person posting doctor studies infectious disease. They're working anti-litigation bill. *""local twat spoiling fight""*

I love British lingo, haha. Please international subs. Remember dude made model? hear banned. Certainly wasnt  understand America making bad decisions, opening forcibly forcing people back work such, stop treated livestock start lives taken seriously? wish would keep diary notebook us write every interaction address.
It impossible do. We're lazy it. Imagine people track get time that. Right solution less? There‚Äôs 200,000 deaths 5 million infections far. That‚Äôs insane number. 

I mean China, place disease started, 5 times population US less 100,000 cases less 5,000 deaths. 

Even Chinese government reporting 1/10 cases US would *still* 5 times cases deaths. 

How happen? hard quarantine immediate healthcare. That‚Äôs fight infectious disease. opening restaurants workers diners easily exposed, sake ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want order delivery‚Äù. Thank laugh LOL :-). people refusing wear masks based bullshit understandings bullshit conspiracy theories narcissistic accomplices manslaughter. pounding skull part. idea.

^/s difference punishing someone following health safety procedures designed protect others transmitting something unknowingly (not using facemask covid/condom HIV/STIs) punishing someone wilfully infecting someone. latter could argue intent due knowledge current infection status. former negligence. 

Yes, fuck people, legal consequences taken negligence actions required define criminal negligence exactly precedents set lead straddling fine line authoritarian behavior health safety. 

In current social climate United States police accused violent enforcing policies based race and/or perceived economic class, instituting policies would encourage disenfranchisement enforcing policies oversight guarantee police would continue similar strategies enforcement legal codes nothing health safety.

Do fine poor homeless wearing masks? going let people warnings assuming mistake? Washington, governor even said mask mandates punitively enforced believes would create even cultural division. faith police legal system treat everyone equally enforce punishments equally, can't enforce policies say ""If see wearing mask, consequences."" western counties able enact/enforce policies USA cannot. 

It shown people enforce law America equally give even authority disenfranchise communities seem statistically ""criminal"" evidence behavioral patterns would cause that. Essentially, people commit crimes would shown police data ones wearing masks following policies would whoever police choose arrest cite. similar claims minority impoverished communities crime thus need increased patrols leads police reported data communities seem rife people ""criminals"" they're ones stopped time criminal activity areas get ignored get let warnings assumed good behavior leads activity even reported police showing data report stops, tickets, etc. 

There police culture problem pandemic cannot used excuse make worse. take insult anyways... 300mil+ americans. they're ignorant troglodytic Exactly, virus spreads normally like SARS quickly contained killed off.

What makes maddest though countries talking opening borders international tourism again, especially europe.

Any country dumb enough reopen international tourism going get hit second wave moronic leadership take blame on. would rather see 100k people sporting events return everyone flying globe willy nilly Unfortunately, people see want. honest, things see back claim... small scale least.

You pretty easily find cases testing errors lead either false positives, even positives people left line even got tests. People deceased. like voting ""scandals"" hear about. facts true extrapolate stories maybe 10 people 350 million.

There also real cases person ""checking out"" hospital/ICU/ER offered option (in friendly nurse patient one-on-one) claim case potential COVID-19 event, literally pay less money get better coverage. Surely nurse trying help person lot money here, create false numbers. believe happened.

COVID-19:

Median age death around 80.


Anybody, anyway, saying COVID-19 remotely comparable 1918 Influenza either complete fucking moron lying get catchy headlines.

105-350 **million** deaths. 

1918 Flu killed substantially toddlers 20-30 year olds senior citizens.


Just fucking asinine comparision insulting highest degree. get fooled agai... oh nvm. fool twice. entire family works hospital tested positive covid back March recovered. I've vising last months without worrying since immune now. cautious now? people truly catch thing twice, one since treat covid patients daily. don‚Äôt know why

Honestly, there's much know, going keep finding shit years come. Slight tangent, sure frustrating see people rail science tho barely brand new virus pictures what's happening *why* able known yet. They're pretty clear surface contamination primary way virus spreads. Saying there's cases surface transmission implying problem way beyond science supports though.

Yes, surface transmission largest risk factor, clearly something taken account making public policy. Nobody ever said shouldn‚Äôt take virus seriously. Swedes took seriously, avoided deaths lockdown causes. Yes may covid deaths neighbors, around 600 outside long term care homes. 

They estimate 6,500 coronavirus deaths prevented lockdown previous article states, atleast 16,000 deaths caused lockdown. net negative 10000. really ‚Äúsave lives‚Äù? Wow, supermarkets banning asymptomatic people? live asymptomatic people even know sick wander around supermarkets freely touching things. honestly point that‚Äôs them. vaccine available there‚Äôs absolutely reason society return normal. think first year vaccine we‚Äôll seeing something like ‚Äúvaccine cards‚Äù private businesses/venues/stadiums/airlines*/etc. require proof entry. government mandate, private sector likely require it. people decide want participate society again, they‚Äôll likely get shot, albeit begrudgingly Glad see okay, personally. unlucky furloughed man's land. Thankfully get COVID assistance money keeps things afloat last forever. Also, family kept jobs nobody received raise year (not unexpected). Scientists learnt praise since childhood incompetent We‚Äôll get this. Things gonna get better. It‚Äôs matter when. meantime, patient thank God everyday you‚Äôre here. We‚Äôve got this! virus airborne lives surfaces - like plastic cardboard. think delivery person would higher risk items touch. believe everything fake can't help you. Probably one can. impact fact outdoor activities relatively safe? yet closed schools age 16 upwards university, yes close know it.

I reason need show humility, stop personal attacks! pointed flaw argument closed schools. like people UK sub keep blaming delayed medical treatment people going ER lockdown. 

As hospitals would running normal people would happy show let virus run wild. 

A lot people seem think two states--the effect virus, effect mitigation measures--and directly compare country than, like, NZ went fully one way other. reality complex system effects things. think saying concerned errors selection bias, totally valid.

If read paper though, many subjects study never hospitalized, recovered home. cardiac symptoms prior enrollment obviously none died COVID (at least prior participating)

So ways might sicker totally asymptomatic population, might less sick cardiac symptoms hospitalized COVID symptoms.

The young age subjects (49 average) compared likely suffer severely COVID-19 also argues something average healthy person needs aware of.

I'm (obviously) favor research, agree I've mischaracterized study population here. Hospitals make money today. foresight conscience. hospital able care staff gets sick contaminate patients, capacity caring exist. Money it‚Äôs goal.

Poorly regulated corporate healthcare conscientious caring corporate leaders. That‚Äôs far expensive yet shit quality healthcare country.

If working places would quit. hospital feed family die become disabled. work organize. It‚Äôs obvious one country going save them, save themselves. Right, that's listed 538. compares Youyang Gu's projections projections... suggest opposite.

I guarantee can't find single time Nate Silver called Youyang Gu ""most reliable"" forecaster. That's straight misinformation. I've started wearing oversized shirts open doors them...

Ask yourself, country, EXACTLY FUCKING MEAN EXACTLY, learned virus today? Literally nobody central answer that. Information fragmented behind thousand small establishments, varying work procedures, equipment, scientific skills, patient sample size &amp; structure money overlords pushing secrecy hope they'll ones strike GOLD finding magic cure. 
The problem medical science done vs. much effort needed across many sub-disciplines, requiring many super smart scientists labs filled expensive &amp; specialized equipment. single entity cover could pool resources together means willing to. 
If humanity would react incoming asteroid threat, humanity would die. Also adds factor people understood first impact Spanish Flu started get prepared 2nd wave. case (COVID) happened opposite.  dangerous flying right now? think genetic differences could explain this. Feel free correct/add anyone. Another thing add I've seen articles say people test positive testing stool sample vs nose sample. virus attack specific parts leave parts untouched seems. team effort players, also deserve credit. complaints them, breaches know of.  MLB players struggled following even non-bubble protocol, apparently much less enthusiastic bubble restrictions possibilities.

It's hard see happening full season. maybe NBA runs condensed season starting January February. virus beast. seems nobody really let guard down, matter flat data looks. Anti-mask, anti-vax type people world contribute much unnecessary death vague notion ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù  Nobody safe, killed babys, old, young, healthy, sick, smokers non-smokers. 

But death really problem, illness likely life, corvid longer. Yes, 6x budget, federal government cant open testing sites, that's individual states, mention throwing money problem fix lot money allocated things cannot defunded except Congress. consider state country yeah let's look per capita, feel information isnt conveyed well everyone looks US one homogeneous government. true death false death? end?  make difference though, people wasted later night less likely adhere social distancing. small difference, difference nonetheless wear mask anywhere immediate neighborhood. live suburbs there's wide empty road, double sidewalks, bike lane available duck chance bump someone going direction. wear mask I'm walking outside exercise purposes.

Since field undergoes tremendous amount advancement fluctuation new technological advances, big chunk material can't simply copied-and-pasted one semester another LMS. take time review every section update either material and/or project-based assessment tools every single semester.

Frankly, enough lazy, tenured professors teach material semester semester - make rest us working keep look bad.  Fuck that. Go kayaking. let‚Äôs see source drink it. comon loose? - Mr Orange- *Fuck* Trump suggest mainlining couple months back press briefing? really selfish. That's really end goal. Right lot people risk option hunker down. people wearing mask serious problem especially hard avoid numerous. 

With vaccine risk take vaccine presumably move without worry. without vaccine take risk solely. still lower though right?

WAY cases per day May number deaths. false negatives asymptomatic transmission chains, might catch cases contact tracing alone. randomly test asymptomatic people like Wuhan pooled PCR testing Cheers bro. empathy running low people. Call like, rejecting evidence presented sum ignorance quickly, understand argument again. 

You still fail understand point making jumping different arguments attempt defend incorrect. 


I said point, said evidence, understand it. Re-read helps. knows... say least one vaccine candidate approved least like effective Sorry. CDC lost credibility. Supporting schools reopening widespread pandemic eliminated CDC list trusted resources. Wasn‚Äôt kind obvious videos China spraying disinfecting subways public areas quarantine? warning signs always there.

Washing hands cleaning surfaces hand sanitizing regularly go long way, wearing mask outside seems help most. feel less fucked. least idea what's going know go find more. even though many problems solvable (or made Waay less worse) there's collective political mass mobilize act.

Then again, live infinitesimal blips eons Earth universe. strive help planet future generations, ffs fun, too.

[Nerdy af, sometimes there's irl wheat hidden chaff]  issue twofold: 

1) indoor airflow (circulating within en enclosed structure) 

2) low indoor air humidity larger droplets evaporate air smaller droplets remain suspended air much longer.

In winter months, indoor air humidity often low, droplets remain suspended hours. 

In summer months, indoor air humidity slightly higher, still low enough droplets remain suspended air several minutes.

In summer months, outdoor air humidity high, droplets remain suspended mere seconds. even absolutely breeze outdoors, droplets expel fall ground vicinity within seconds expelled, slim chance carried 12 feet away inhaled another person. mini-strokes.

The second category Notice Quit document written waiting court open end month. [JAMA report article Utensils, plates, drinkware, dining area... cant stand Trump. I'm talking capita numbers UK currently worse. Thst could change month, saying right UK better inaccurate. Asia masked January CDC tell public mask America knee deep virus... why? testing positivity % still disturbingly high. Aloy! weird duality live in, least US. Sometimes almost feels like covid collective dream everything almost gone back normal. Meanwhile cases deaths keep rising! Again, appears there's actual evidence t-cells giving immunity. evidence people them. 

You can't assume it.  makes zero sense. actual fatality rate 0,5% means least 8 million people - id personally guess ball park 12 million contrast, sister cowoker family got it. sick strong influenza like symptoms, husband something akin normal cold, child symptoms all. absolutely could determine source, isolating time non-family contact weeks. husband delivery driver \*might\* picked something work, delivering alone close contact customers co-workers either. Kid home social distanced weeks point. Fire one natural phenomena behaves like virus. every spark become inferno, conditions right, boom. 


And we're kindling. No. treat people way treat others. disrespect people based profession, piece shit deserve respect yourself. people scum.  fuck, death toll fatality rate two completely different metrics? Smells like abuse statistics. Texas lawmakers racking positives every week. Wew shocking totally thought blind vaccine unblinded him... caused infighting allow races go ahead. Thats infighting necessarily asymptomatic. people never bothered getting tested symptoms we're mild whatever reason. soon restaurants opened husband got invited out. said going go long time. customers think I'm asshole tell dare go eat right now. think replied wrong comment I'm expert take big grain salt, think based exact sort testing they're doing. Quick result testing means invested platform machine onsite process samples quickly. Slow result testing means collecting samples sending remote lab processing.
    
  
AFAIK differences accuracy, quick testing less accurate not-so-quick testing.  Work restaurant, caught Covid. agree. would say no. Fuck them. deserve money especially callus start pandemic.

But thousands, millions people live Florida, disproportionately hurt one man (de Santis) actions.

He resign.  state managed weather virus toll order bad flu season relatively minimal disruption society. protected elderly far better states got hit early. sure agree DeSantis hate. Oh, blimey! 1918 influenza pandemic deadliest modern history, claiming estimated 50 million lives worldwide, including 675,000 United States.

By measures, toll Covid-19 surge New York City spring resembled 1918 flu pandemic. March April, overall death rate 30 percent lower height pandemic city, despite modern medical advances, according analysis published Thursday JAMA Network Open.

Many people liken Covid-19 seasonal influenza regarding 1918 flu pandemic time incomparable devastation, said Dr. Jeremy Faust, emergency medicine physician Brigham Women‚Äôs Hospital Boston lead author analysis.

‚ÄúBut reality, 1918 looked like basically this,‚Äù said, except dead bodies refrigerated trucks rather piled streets.

‚ÄúI want people realize magnitude saw spring, we‚Äôre seeing again, truly historic,‚Äù Dr. Faust added.

Historians studied 1918 pandemic agreed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs especially important pandemic deniers saying, ‚ÄòOh, isn‚Äôt worse than, say, 1968 flu pandemic,‚Äô‚Äù said Dr. Howard Markel, historian University Michigan.

‚ÄúThis pretty deadly pandemic. it‚Äôs getting worse ‚Äî that‚Äôs scary part.‚Äù

Amid pandemic, difficult determine exact cause death, even sophisticated diagnostic tools. Dr. Faust colleagues compared data ‚Äúall-cause mortality‚Äù ‚Äî deaths cause ‚Äî New York City two pandemic periods.

Nearly 33,500 people died New York City March 11 May 11 year, according city‚Äôs Department Health Mental Hygiene. total population nearly 8.3 million, amounts incident rate 202.08 deaths per 100,000 person-months ‚Äî standard way denoting deaths time.

The overall death rate 61 days four times rate corresponding periods 2017 2019.

The researchers looked deaths October November 1918, peak city‚Äôs flu outbreak. found detailed mortality statistics collected Census Bureau, relatively new agency, archived Centers Disease Control Prevention.

Dr. Faust identified 31,589 deaths among 5.5 million city residents, incident rate 287.17 deaths per 100,000 person-months. number nearly three times higher city‚Äôs death rate previous three years. all, death rate city last spring 70 percent seen 1918.

When epidemic hit 1918, spike deaths shocking city 2020. time, increase deaths less three times higher previous year‚Äôs toll, researchers noted, whereas 2020‚Äôs rise four times higher 2019‚Äôs figure.

Simply put, life riskier hundred years ago.

‚ÄúIt less healthy less safe world,‚Äù Dr. Faust said. one sense, added, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre worse today 1918,‚Äù started much safer, technologically advanced place. impact epidemic dramatically lower today, slightly lower.

Indeed, people today conditioned ‚Äúmedical industrial complex‚Äù think diseases conquered, said Nancy Tomes, historian American health care Stony Brook University.

That may many Americans, particularly believe pandemic overblown, angered find virus upended lives, added.

‚ÄúIn 1918, people familiar infectious diseases dying them,‚Äù Dr. Tomes said. ‚ÄúThere whole kind expectation today shouldn‚Äôt happening.‚Äù Got hit low 20, 4000UI daily. difference. boggles mind. would think people would love hide themselve quite opposite, even committing crimes wear mask hide identity. quarantine rough i'm thinking risking all

edit: joking aside. curious someone recovered covid reinfected infect someone else. I'm guessing cant infect anyone CDC says go back school/work/etc 10 days. guess different philosophies respect others

The next day, August 8th, were:

Pretty much every case plausibly tied contact infected person, even actual route transmission surface. 
 
There's also distinct possibility virus really need inhaled infectious though. fomite transmission tends cause low/no symptom infections. makes sense - lots viruses spread well mucous membrane contact, need ingested directly exposed blood stream. I'm aware respiratory viruses particular behave way, certainly question, would certainly explain lot strangeness surrounding range symptom severity. Case point guy ""not Iraq!"" Thats deaths? Oh God...wtf wrong country?! ones trying really trying enough combat sheer amount ignorant assholes live here. I'm atheist love God pray America need it!

In short:

## efforts decisions Government aim to:

### 1. Limit spread infection country

By limiting spread virus, Government aims relieve pressure health care system protect people‚Äôs lives, health jobs.

### 2. Ensure health medical care resources available

The Government aims ensure municipalities regions, provide health care, necessary resources. reason, central government cover extraordinary¬†costs arising result pandemic, e.g. higher costs additional staff protective equipment.

### 3. Limit impact critical services

To ensure society continue function, Government monitors needs takes decisions required ensure health care, police, energy supply, communications, transport food supply systems, example, maintain activities.

### 4. Alleviate impact people businesses

The Government presented crisis packages mitigate financial impact pandemic Swedish businesses, organisations agencies, save people‚Äôs jobs livings.

### 5. Ease concern

By continuously providing information, Government aims make clear measures taken, why. Government broadcasts important information live website, regeringen.se. Written information Government‚Äôs efforts, measures decisions also available there.

### 6. Implement right measures right time

Also, due respect, please stop using literally incorrectly. Gotta love 10-15 cent union raises.

I got merit raise once! 10 cents. HR specifically took aside point out. Mentioned owner building thank him. Thanks extra $3 week! Nice Burberry coat costs make month.  Add soccer Europe, basically religion. Finland, Estonia Lithuania closed. Norway Greece difficult require mandatory quarantine arrival certified positive test. Ireland closed. Sweden, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia, Aruba Malta mandatory 14 week quarantine return, difficult need go back work physically (you effectively take two extra week holiday people much paid time off).

The largest problem country close time. either cancel holiday problems coming back.  handle carefully, wash hands. needs get infect you. many young people dying US? countries high death tolls young largely unaffected, US kids, teenagers young adults die seemingly large numbers. gives? single people pets require care, like dog? I'm sad know job shitty (I used work Walmart) I've seen like five workers noses hanging masks. I'm grocery store cashier. Kroger pays $13.80 hour, consistently ignores availability, pencils shifts less 10 hours notice. also refuse message change schedule made. 

I've looking work several weeks can't find anything area, I'm stuck job mentally physically wears way much earning actually make. I've verbally abused, physically threatened *almost* assaulted customers since Covid restrictions started. 

I also received less $600 cumulatively Kroger's constantly changing ""hero pay"" programs (not currently going, mind you). 

Anyone else similar situation? wrote twitlonger could link anyone wants read it. I'll upfront say skilled labor/trades think horribly overlooked viable (and often better) path compared saddling debt degree low value. much issue we're almost universally telling kids college best/only path even degree guarantees stable career/income.

That said, also bit 'issue' anecdotal evidence supporting 'blue collar' work see shared lot Reddit. Maybe anecdotal quite right, really going pretend average electrician makes anywhere near 6 cherry picking links...they're literally first 3 show google search average electrician salary. /u/Brutish citing personal compensation statistics show nearly 2x average highest paying state 2.5x lowest applicable average 18 year old deciding career path top Neurosurgeon citing salary justification med school amazing option. Also, electrician commonly cited one 'better' trades, comparing high earner representative 'non-college' route like looking certain STEM/Business degrees side coin.

I want come personal attack isn't. rest answer less directed specific response many comments/posts seen overly simplistic view ""Duh, plumber/garbageman/electrician/etc. obvious better going college many people &lt;XYZ anecdotal reductive lucrative blue collar professions exactly cash cows insinuated comments seen **and** come sets challenges too. Many uncles distant relatives worked blue collar jobs made ton sacrifices children could attend college. developed form knee/back/joint issue early late-30's. free serious health issues (at least best knowledge), look 40's 50's argue looked terms wear-and-tear compared 'office' counterparts age. Also, youngest father's side stop working entirely early make hasty/stressful transition 'management' role (and always would be) 24 year old goober year two university form 'Building Construction Management' degree. Yes, understand I'm citing anecdotal evidence now, guys made right along averages professions (nowhere near 6 figures, even adjusted inflation) suffered terms physical health working jobs generally far physically demanding stressful compared sitting desk 90% workday. FFS, there's reason stereotypical immigrant dream many ethnic groups working hard kids could go college experience burdens did.

Even disregarding everything paragraph above, issue somewhat common assumption desirable skilled trade jobs sort 'no-brainer yet undiscovered' gem option suits everyone. Simple math tells us everyone electrician plumber interest increased 100x overnight. Looking beyond numbers, like anyone walk trade school apprenticeship immediately successful. I'm college-educated developer could transition pretty easily bunch sectors outside tech. PLENTY blue collar jobs I'm certain last couple years at. physical aspect mentioned before...the learning self-teaching aspects working job like Electrician honestly rigorous demanding lot white collar fields require generic degree. similar said...if sample 10 people choose go college, probably see 9 people working shitty service jobs every 1 person working one desirable trades mentioned above.

This may controversial, feel like trend (in theory) absolutely towards going college average HS graduate. Especially automation overall technological shifts horizon. Despite flaws, college provides good 'base' regards socialization general acclimatization developing/honing many soft skills valuable profession. many, true opportunity individualized education decisions personal preferences noticeable impacts. cost anywhere near absolutely insane amounts now. result, absolutely support growing trend (in practice) young adults exposed college alternatives well normalizing said alternatives society. think people need aware much like degree automatically mean make 6 figures college guaranteed upper-middle class lifestyle, pursuing blue collar alternative also going idealistic suitable might think. Reading article I'm seeing single issue besides COVID union fix. Something protesters gathering large crowds vs Christians attending church... get reinfected again, say bye bye herd immunity. 

Not medical professional, but, isn‚Äôt true statement? Sherlock. Im polite think ""hells yeah us youngs polite"" remember literally middle age get sad explain people dont takes high paying jobs. mean that? Also trying help prevent workers harrassed customers? freedumbs! Well, US pretty bad that. It‚Äôs mostly place torment. worry would early so... Noice. 830000 tests first time well. Hope million test mark reached next week. city hospitals half empty, lockdown complete fucking joke. thing kill diseases 'one month since positive dead' number used Sweden. also number 'dead doctor wrote covid19 death certificate finally number excess deaths. three show less number, difference percent. month window might good enough catch majority cases. saw someone haircut I'd already assume idiot.  there's one thing giving false sense security washing hands thing virus easily spread via aerosols. would government's job make law like that.

Politicians tailor state they're though. see Republican governors liberal states taking drastic actions criticising Trump administration - like Larry Hogan Maryland Charlie Baker Massachusetts. issue think Trump always calls media fake news makes supporter believing kind situation guys right now.

I clear - I'm Australian, American. However, seem like Trump administration undermining COVID messaging describe. Especially highly partisan times, messaging party leaders right thing important. Trump often downplayed virus, promoted medical advice questionable effectiveness undermined things like masks (the President should, like Biden does, wear mask whenever way appropriate messaging purposes). case, ""not positive"" really mean negative, means obviously positive abundance detectable antibodies.

Same applies pregnancy tests: negative test taken early mean pregnant going mandate masks memorial services either, so... votes also make easier rig. 1000 votes cast much harder flip votes without noticed 100,000 votes. Given Republicans love rigging elections understand wanting increase number voters. mean he‚Äôs wrong? 

You idea long term affects virus nobody does. used similar term rude woman Walmart looked like crazy. I'm TN school started back week person, optional distance learning. son's middle school move distance learning school even opened children!!!! 2 weeks DL everyone 2 administrators positive, 2 guidance symptoms, 10 teachers exposed. 

Schools county postpone opening couple days 40% students signed DL. thought pretty impressive rural TN. schools expecting it. know enough, I'm kind proud almost half county taking covid seriously enough willingly distance learn. incredibly high 3% countries. Ya know flu killed 38 60k Americans last year shut herrrrrr derrrrrrrrr There's study Singapore showing patient contaminate room stays in. EVERYWHERE. Herpes (and Chickenpox, another virus this) DNA viruses. know mechanism RNA virus like one could stay dormant body like Herpes does. fact hazard pay general wage raises essential workers (which yes apparently includes us restaurant workers) pushed incredibly infuriating. deactivate valve, longer valved mask, point still stands.

Not sure insist calling something not. stunningly liberal! socialist country now?!?! /s Managers come ideas idiots love unnecessary meetings

Edit- companies function majority workforce off-site, cost savings would huge. Especially places like SF Bay area. course would hurt developer, F them. mow anything grows pour concrete mega $$$$$. U B really hate people make shit sub. multi disciplinary cohort National Academies Science, Engineering, Medicine determine deploy vaccines available. I‚Äôve seen medicine, high risk, teachers early groups...never athletes. Although teacher, ball fuck court field. Pieces shit. CDC pretty clear purpose masks keep respiratory droplets reaching others aid source control. However, masks one-way valves vents allow air exhaled hole material, result expelled respiratory droplets reach others. type mask prevent person wearing mask transmitting COVID-19 others. Therefore, CDC recommend using masks source control exhalation valve vent.

The schilerian observational videos cloth masks disagree assessment well work. 

If think hole mask lets air unfiltered narrow constriction increases velocity stream per Bernoulli's principle, point trying conversation you. decide stop denying science common sense, try again.

Maybe err side caution listen respirator valve effective purpose respirator‚Äôs exhalation valve reduce breathing resistance exhalation; impact respirator‚Äôs ability provide respiratory protection. valve designed open exhalation allow exhaled air exit respirator close tightly inhalation, inhaled air permitted enter respirator valve. valve change respirator‚Äôs ability help reduce wearer‚Äôs exposure bioaerosols, recommended person exhibiting symptoms illness wear valved respirator, possibility exhaled particles may leave respirator via valve enter surrounding environment. summary:***

In words, think product effective scenario. insisting is? highly, highly suspect unconscious face-touching accounts disparity given credit for.

I'm also nurse, immune suppressants autoimmune condition. even pandemic, made herculean effort condition never touch face public. public place, work. Grocery store carts gross out.

People deeply underestimate much risk involved touching face. Several fit healthy friends mine came strange viral infection end October/beginning November, one bed ridden weeks another took 2 months recover. Makes wonder was. Keep good work Lucky anything important needs addressed month..! CDC uneducated ever. valve helps keep mask seal tights lets small amount air usually pointed 

Without valve CDC approved mask ‚ÄúSurgical‚Äù mask lift upon exhale let significantly unfiltered viral particles - try it! Additionally cloth masks turn virus Aerosolized Plume Valve limits that! 

Fauci large gaps mask top - Dont see worrying much user bullshitting you. exist. troll account, look posts.

United States would mean TON people have/have death rate maybe lower thought virus would burn quicker. also means there‚Äôs ton active cases, that‚Äôs good get stimulus ourselves, seize means production.

Take care stay safe That‚Äòs said. 

If two symptoms written as: it. test needed. it. outcome positive test. 

If one mild symptoms, tested. So... touch face. That's thing. can't get touching something, need let virus pass body. wow comments posts crazy. bothers too. I've also let toxic friendships go years. he's stand-up guy field. he's suffering level public threat political partisanship would make lesser men weep.  


We need soft earliest mistakes move past illusion perfect even imperfect science. Science path hypothesis testing. false wrong right. somehow new truth proves false move toward better/greater/more precise one.  Telling people wear homemade masks early quite thing tell nation 300 million. still experts training previous administration we'd likely enough internal lobbying disease experts swarm right politicans say unified preparedness ""We must X terribly health outcome decimate country.""  


And compared sciences, medicine wedded partner public healthpolicy always advance odd times war, crisis, disease outbreak, lifestyle epidemics.  


The deeper problem culture. Many nations cultures commonly wearing masks sick, certainly helped transmission rates key times. Cultures less experience common practice workplace public transport descended political anarchy. need modify culture. 


All us need hound friends family better. Hound little voice whispers head step outside saying ""Ehhh, *so-and-so* angry wearing mask. probably wear mask. good thing anyway...""  get people still get sick. go hospitals. Hospital overrun again. patients able get care need. Maybe hospitals refuse care vaccinated covid patients then. Nope. Sheev got stuff done. NY Nationwide, guys think everything open like before, i.e. schools, restaurants, etc. largest college (liberal arts sciences) state university, salaries 80-90% budget. high level admin salaries definitely bloated (3-4x tenured professor), capping salaries would probably help long term. Can't cases avoid testing.

This ideal **deception**. enables lie everything improving truth hidden buried.

The United States failed country. rot deep wide. makes literally zero goddamn sense, alright cool. wouldnt believe know ppl like this. 

Their big orange daddy told dem hoax. white people also less ACE2 receptors, one entry ways virus.

And dentist also believe make sure time work done waits til tell I'm numb starts going it. TIME give numbing stuff. swears nothing hair color... Same. is. masks offer little protection, point little better nothing article discusses potential line causation recent outbreak New Zealand. It‚Äôs something consider cases seroconversation cannot readily explained. jump conclusions without lot data.

With recent outbreak salmonella onions North America it‚Äôs easy see food vector illness evidence required t9 think possible respect Covid it‚Äôs novel complex.

Key points:

‚Äú*The possibility SARS-CoV-2 could survive shipments frozen goods isn‚Äôt wild. Studies suggested virus particles remain infectious three days plastic surfaces room temperature. virus stable lower temperatures, like refrigerated warehouse*‚Äù

‚Äú*Aboubakr suggests it‚Äôs theoretically possible SARS-CoV-2 could spread contaminated food food packaging. addition cold survival, early laboratory data suggesting virus survive highly acidic conditions, similar environment human stomach. But, notes experts skeptical this. Overall, says ‚Äúthere sharp answer‚Äù risk food food packaging studies confirmed link*‚Äù

‚Äú*The point echoed World Health Organization, notes ‚Äúcurrently evidence people catch COVID-19 food food packaging‚Äù*‚Äù

‚Äú*Aboubakr says investigators New Zealand need lot data information assess risk spread freight pin new cases contaminated packages*‚Äù

Also note: couldn‚Äôt find appropriate flair New Zealand. believe it‚Äôs considered ‚ÄúOceanian sub-region known Australasia‚Äù that‚Äôs one options. spend several weeks allowing uncontrolled spread first. However case patients isolated early. 

New cases discovered contact tracing, due waiting symptoms presenting hospital.

Not necessarily. could using technology.

Just wash hands handling unpacking frozen items, sure cook food. Nothing new... true, Lets see looks like weeks. want called stupid hay seed? pride that? Yes, shows virus one point. show viable virus. Oh definitely are. go CDC website, see flu/pneumonia deaths, strokes, heart related deaths WAAAY previous years. like oneliners stir either. 


Texas: March 15 - Aug. 1 : 15,700 excess deaths, 7,477 Covid-19 deaths, gap 8,200 . 


 mean, give 2020 ideas, think (yet). Lol, Poe‚Äôs Law strikes following this, looked like reached 20% less infection 1/3 1/4 herd immunity NYC. 

That course assumes infected confers long term immunity, currently given. evidence theory pretty thin. First all, infection rates, hospitalizations deaths going since mid-April. Vacation period didn‚Äôt start late June. 

Secondly, shorter holidays spring (Easter Valborg) seems associated plateaus declining rate infection, rather decrease. holidays, people gather larger extended families tend increase infection rates. 

Third, far every Swede access summer house, usually share extended family. haven‚Äôt got access summer house spent vacation period cities towns, crowded usual year. 

All all, case vacation period slowing infection rates isn‚Äôt slam dunk.  put social distance measures place.

 poorly written headline. still protect getting covid19 I'd say help stop spread. Can't find exact value, Sunday news show IIRC, GovTrack rated liberal Sanders Exactly Trump administration wants it. new cases new tests. 100% answer well. want return normal willing take risk. people want get bump higher line. 

For much well works. works 50% people given seems like waste. 80% something like even two doses sign up. call France? Quarter-pounder Battle Cheese. Wouldn‚Äôt great someone charge could, least, offer public opportunity purchase reliable masks reasonable cost? Show understand theses things operate. know doctor would place Covid-19 comorbidity, dont use every case.

I never said ""they use every case"".

My point unless want live lalaland, ""suspected Covid cases"" going wrong.

*Medical errors 3rd leading cause death USA*.

Doctors *certainly* infallible. meant intentionally mislead redditors thinking valid point demonstrates carefree attitude medical professionals lump deaths Covid-19 related, definantially case demonstrated source.

All said definitely cases mis-coded. Doctors demonstrably fallible, situation even suspicion Covid involvement enough code death Covid.

What think part document means always apply instructions, whether considered medically correct not

Do think important death certificate medically correct? Ya think? Nothing know cures generally healthy appear stack odds much favour.

Getting enough sleep, exercise, generally trying avoid overly stressed, getting enough vitamin B3, losing weight overweight, smoking etc etc things appear improve chances.

Some probably due generally keeping healthy immune system. may specific role regarding covid-19, particularly preventing spreading beyond respiratory system (once starts affect brain, prognosis appears particularly poor). may turn coincidence benefit positive things life anyway.  Well got control, everybody could see locked city millions down, nice warning.
Ofc play open could have, believe would changed anything.
In Europe reacted here, US same. People react threat next door, seen.
And realized face new virus, obviously already world. Cough cough air conditioning COUGH Yes population massive slow halt get definitely feeling point vaccine 3% effective therefore everyone immune. plans wear mask even everyone vaccinated we‚Äôve achieved herd immunity. article say headline then. misinformation tell full story. that's tall ask ""journalism"" 2020. need Navy seals find kill corona, like Osama. What? go bottom studies listed linked? possible vaccine SARS would provided cross immunity.

You're wrong, would save thousands lives every flu season even without coronavirus. bar now, we're going annual mask orders? releases small portion exhale, vast majority goes back mask, even half face respirators. valves make little difference everyone wearing masks. went Burger King yesterday, depressed shit me. friend ordered via app, drive thru wrapped around itself, called phone number hung 5 times, went inside, cop followed (why?

So either two things protective effect terms respiratory infections 25 years serving hundreds day meant I've caught nearly common Rhino Corona Virus Colds Flu's immune system immune least adept dealing get noticeably symptomatic.

Point is, I'm confident already caught Sars-Cov2 asymptomatic, asymptomatic eventually catch it......but still wear mask gloves stand behind comprehensive near floor ceiling wrap around Plexiglass/Perspex Clear Plastic rolls screen built myself.....because I'm anti mask idiot want vector customers likely asymptomatic spreader ever catch it.

However overwhelming tide morons wearing masks small convenience store wearing nose wearing outside, pulling inside shop putting back leave.....well.....that tide morons making lose faith humanity!! They‚Äôre claiming people dying reasons labeled Covid deaths

The past decades started show lie - problems government, climate, pandemic happening. 

They've slowly sliding crisis - admit whole lives based false belief take accountability things they've done wrong (including ruining things future generations), double believe harder hope lie proved true?

Enter Trump, sells latter idea defiance actual reality, they'll believe anything long gives hope wrong. cling hope hard they're clinging views given lives meaning along.  cost dying virus they're sure exists small compared cost admitting big problems they've created.

It would terribly sad screwing rest us hard. Try adding sick severe corona 5 months. Since adding things : )

It's simply little opportunity cost potentially large payoff. don‚Äôt know data. would trust CDCs data USA rather foreign institute. everyone caught became hospitalized would've died back something like 64,500 people hospitalized COVID July 14th hospitals switch reporting CDC HHS. point time almost 3.5 million confirmed cases almost 140,000 deaths. Even assumed absolutely one discharged hospital die since start pandemic one else currently infected would require future hospitalizations, would still put roughly 200,000 people roughly 5.7% population risk needing medical care/dying every 3.5 million cases.

Obviously cases we've caught, excess deaths explained COVID 50,000 right now, vast majority hospitalizations take 6 months come resolution there's way know cancel end. said, horribly unreliable ballpark estimate 5.7% people bad shape every 3.5 million people infected would mean population 103.2 million 1918, roughly 1.9 million Americans would've risk hospitalization death 33% contracted COVID back (which worldwide estimated rate infection Spanish Flu). burning witches stake whatever passed medical care back snuff relative today's standard, perhaps well could've exceeded estimated 675,000 people died back even around third people requiring hospitalizations survive straight died.

Ironic global total map reads bit differently per capita chart, though still among top testing... I'm sure trying argue here. China four times population US. I'm sure two ""re-positive"" 1.4 billion people contradict statement chance catching twice ridiculously low. 

Speaking specific cases, contact tracing done none people close contact two person tested positive. bottom line is, considering China absolutely zero chill regarding personal freedom comes curbing virus, would bigger movement ""re-positive"" bigger issue looks like.

For record, I, personally, believe US telling truth, base fact leadership previously shown lie less important things.

It's really shows masks, cleaning/disinfecting, isolating, distancing, good testing essentially eradicate covid. know 400 people there, close everyone is, one person get it, could spread easily. coworker(s) actually believe too.

Sure, probably errors reporting data.

*But make less deadly pandemic.*

We've got reported case $work, think fit gonna hit Monday.  Here's hoping local health department puts boot squarely $work's butt. Nope. vaccine widely available people opt that‚Äôs bad them. They‚Äôve made choice take risk country opening up. 

I feel bad cannot vaccinated, impact selfish poorly informed (large) minority one hell meme material. like never. We‚Äôre going Oxford and/or Moderna, pass Phase III. way ever import sloppy vaccine Russia. Contingency plans something like exist. situation's never contemplated. don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true always read articles doctors complaining much hard identify covid symptoms patient presenting. idk maybe saying sensationalize people love things large groups. friends around cut it, want ""out"" ""cool place"" lots people also happy there.

They still shouldn't, good understand impulses lead there. mean.... can't really eat mask on. Oh damn.. that‚Äôs rough. thought made profit food least. bet type person puts bare feet things flight. always tell Reddit didn‚Äôt read article, let alone paper quoting.

Oh boy Big Bird going shiit mean, already shame they‚Äôre cool beating kid. Well socializing, event, ""happening"". could possibly expected drop this, WH wanting Covid patient info bypassing CDC.

Several vaccines require multiple doses.

Probably spring 2021 able get one anywhere want one US. read said. 

Just history mean fatal one triggered COVID. 

In fact, COVID would likely trigger someone preexisting condition.  It‚Äôs beyond child endangerment point. Whole goddamn education system irresponsible federal government held accountable blackmailing schools whole deal goes tits Stupid people smart enough listen experts. Like Socrates said, (excuse shitty paraphrasing,) smartest man knows knows nothing. police Middletown working law enforcement officials New York positively identify couple suspected 20‚Äôs 30‚Äôs based license plate number captured scene.

You say Sweden ""vacation summer home"" since April? ""Cause death Time interval onset death Acute respiratory distress syndrome J80 2 days b Due to: Pneumonia J18.9 10 days c Due to: ***Suspected*** COVID-19 ""

As see done sake correctly estimating data spread find hot spots.

So sorry ironclad evidence intentional misleading unintentional misleading whatever purpose heard created 


Edit: might actually hinting done purposes fear baiting intentionally misleading purpose political agenda. must clear also done clear symptoms logically included suspected Covid-19 related death.

You're right even though CDC annual budget 11.1 Billion dollars, excused incompetence long learn it.

But again, stay topic. China warn world asymptomatic spread 25/01/2020 not? world listen not? people get 40% effective flu shot every year? thing. Potentially even less efficacy. Yeah like forced children go try kill bin Ladin. Hi. Someone posted feed today. Claims virus over. We've achieved herd immunity. Normally I'd ignore claims there's lots science-y stuff I'm hoping learned redditors dissect?  Covid 20 like ""Well howdy"" everybodies going like ""WHO COULD'VE EVER SEEN COMING"" many 35 people give to? B-b-b-but called heroes! enough???

Obvious /s think big thing NYC spike quick drastic know even there. huge spike, people went better lockdown compared areas south/midwest there's much international travel hit early on.

Arizona almost similar story - got really bad there, people started changing behaviors.

School opening colder weather (worse immune systems top flu season) things really worrying me. I'm glad lot schools chosen distance learning. thought would love option. one teachers spearheaded transition virtual learning March able retain 22 24 students aged 3 6. perfect went really well!

I heard anything going remote administration yet- though meeting later week. shame. much could developed summer make virtual learning accessible, interactive, engaging seamless...but sadly happen. much less severe 1918,

I don‚Äôt know people keep saying this. pandemic already bigger impact society we‚Äôre 8 months it. Spanish Flu lasted 2 years. idea final impact COVID-19 we‚Äôre right middle it. It‚Äôs still going on. ok, know. CLEAR EVIDENT proof what's going on. 40% deaths far form elderly care know community outbreaks Bars Restaurants. major hot spots. 

There's one thing that's missing, house parties major gathering spots (Church, sports,etc).

These deaths PREVENTABLE. Let's fix public policy restore schools, sports etc well hotels, airplane small business industries get control. 

&amp;#x200B;

Its hard. sure, not? talk phone zoom. Upvotes happened, guess. really need quit reddit. know national lockdown, might local shutdowns. much really known pandemic, sure. Nope can't, he'd rather tell ""high"", could mean anything 5% 99%. 100% evil go individual people.

We're talking qualified immunity here, point go individual even win make life hell. There's big difference strong arming innocent IRS worker job control sheriff hiding behind qualified immunity risk people's lives. evil person deserve it. business class, losing people age groups 65+ casualty. one less retired person generating money businesses anyway Wuhan wild wings!

Thank you‚Ä¶ sorry, Also good point young, professional athletes, middle-aged shape people. suffer long term effects, there‚Äôs nothing stopping general population 9 cases basically people showed first day already infected. (It takes time show symptoms get test results.) 35 we're hearing includes everybody spread to! That's said. masks distancing measures, virus retreats 20%. talking yesterday. loval hospital, dont symptoms want work.

Doesnt matter exposed (whether work home)

They would let one nurse used cares act hours kid got it. said show symptoms. way wrong multiple levels.

Nailed perfectly then. yeah, hitler forgiving germans happy without colonies ability increase power.

populism finds way. make sound like reason ww1 all. relax, normal antibodies virus decrease time. ‚ÄúiT iS‚Äù True. could collect unemployment probably way stockboy makes. Agreed. unfortunate media exploited people's fear omitted numbers could give people realistic assessment risk covid. Obviously dangerous want catch it, shutting entire planet absurd strategy virus death rate likely kill far people saves. See CDC pandemic guidance see contradictory response is: Actually, support that. Think much shit could pass bananas self-checkout, grocery stores would lose even due theft. Sounds like future I'd want.

Still excuse treat people like shit simply job. can't treat people human decency, go store. Period. agree might nightmare eating disorder sufferers group face campaigns trigger them. 

There plenty people (more documented) socially accepted regular things every day public life nightmare...

If something triggers you, avoid (I‚Äôm expert this), require rest world avoid it!!! Excess deaths still quite bit higher confirmed COVID deaths. Also 0.9% IFR excludes LTC homes. course do. stated fact, rather saying ""The figures suggest..."".

It decent sized sample, disputing that. But, headline states ""Major Antibody Study Finds 3.4 Million England **Had** Covid-19"".

That pure extrapolation simply true. No, believe really? Trump said virus magically disappear like flu summer.

People must drinking enough bleach. /s Pooled testing lot less useful you‚Äôre looking 20% positive rate too. pool 4 people you‚Äôve got 60% chance test coming back positive. don‚Äôt know pooled testing really worth effort point, save couple tests people wait longer results. Would nice ready go first sign spike ship long sailed.... overestimate rationality Florida  every Reddit comment needs dissertation. masks could save thousands lives every year, world would choose wear them? I'm surprised they're worse. CA number 1? I'm CA many cities getting bad press anti-mask huge gatherings beach. also moat coronavirus cases state. trust study. run tests, cases !...

Hold \*check notes\*

Ah, got it. run tests, reported cases, damage Trump's election ! Yeah, makes sense Ohhhh, need this. *‚ÄùA study published March indicated Chinese authorities acted three weeks earlier did, number coronavirus cases could reduced 95% geographic spread limited.*

*This timeline, compiled information reported Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, South China Morning Post sources, shows China's cover-up delay serious measures contain virus lasted three said possible mode transmission. know virus lasts surfaces. Hand washing actually important part slowing spread many diseases.

The transmission right mostly droplet aerosol, lapsing basic hygiene increase surface exposure mode transmission. *you‚Äôre vitamin deficiency immune system peak performance. Also reminder even athletes, fit generally healthy, immune. guy crazy Trump?

It's really there, stuff does. Yes, article complete misinformation. weekly increase number tests declined 20% 1%. Tests still increasing. get whole South agree bunch stupid stubborn assholes. seeing cultism even religiosity prevents able even look scientific evidence even form open mind eye - much less able think themselves, well... hopes high.

I'd say feel sorry South, themselves. outdoor data, 21 times less likely get infected outdoor indoors. Though guess data outdoor dining specifically. Replacing doesn‚Äôt thing.

How preloading it? get virus. Oh man, arguments social media general often pretty unproductive. I'd really like subreddit people discourse topics actually trying listen understand throwing around attacks backhanded insults. happened mutual respect inquisitive curiosity?

The truest nightmare scenario loved one's getting sick. food transmit it, there's 20+ million cases worldwide, would know food transmit did. really sucks excess death anywhere, people serious medical conditions afraid go-to ER. 

I one severe GI issues month blood started scared enough force hospital.

It sucks really never know many less deaths actually sars2. I‚Äôm bit confused please don‚Äôt chew head off, wrong said? don‚Äôt normally eat restaurants begin hardly ever would want takeout, pandemic notwithstanding. nothing thinking it‚Äôs safe not. would rather cook myself. said something else conflicting misleading mistake. ask JD then?

You placed info without asked.

The correct answer to, PhD, clean ""No"".

And accounts I'm completely correct you. doubt say are. think anonymous forum like Reddit gets sorts idiots folks claiming Scientists, footballers, Lawyers general bullshit made stuff.

If sat parents, living there, 20 years old, loser mate. That's know. airflow virus particles disperse rather building concentrations.

Then government step give everyone $1200 ***per month*** pandemic control.

Yeah...a LOT things done differently. Almost certainly probable. vacation? expect check emails maybe even reply vaction, better prepared pay time. expected here.

I hate allowing society customers clearly wrong. anyone friends server tell you, people horrible don‚Äôt tip. people shouldn‚Äôt tolerated. go around total immunity. treat employees like shit get away it.

I‚Äôm fortunate high paying job home, pressure return office, giving extra sick time due Covid (but given work home I‚Äôd need bedridden unable work).

It‚Äôs completely unfair people actually need interact people aren‚Äôt given adequate sick leave, force put rude customers top asking much.

I always wished way rate customers. don‚Äôt know could done well, it‚Äôs dream. Weight protected class major country I'm aware of. living? 

Oh plan biker events. got Smash Mouth play!

You something else. OP's idea stated fucking ridiculous. partially true, obese people can't lose weight night. Don‚Äôt forget police officers. majority officers good people risked lives lives families showing work throughout pandemic. Often without PPE plan keep safe. met universal revile hatred communities showed protect. IMO there's three economic roles, they're correlated indirectly class per se.

There owners, consumers, labor. US, actually prioritize consumer others, especially labor. consumer US always expectation business bend backward serve them, necessary, owner compel labor meet consumer, *e.g.* sending employees work pandemic. Businesses need compete prices, also need support broadly correct social agendas, consumers reason loyal instead switching competitor -- generally plenty.

In countries, labor priority consumers owners suck up. worker great. consumer might mean need get shopping done 3pm Sunday workers want go home. means workers problem rude customer fear job depends quality service. definitely means owners pay lesser skilled workers who, worst cases, can't fired.

And owners prioritized worst worlds. Prices high, quality awful, choice. looks like stephen baldwin wrong since day one. can't vaccinate dead people bring back life vaccine. vaccine help lifelong issues caused infection. Even without vaccine also keep virus low numbers died Sweden would died old age virus chance infect them. loop. Yeah.

What point? government done anything right point, stupid assume right now. Rely science, politics media. read study see guy clue talking another Karen spreading misinformation vaccines. G strain spread quicker? countries now? wish someone would ask people take cure live TV see often Canada, illegal police show issue fines. 12 hour long queues get tested would say otherwise. might get shot.

Fire fucking EVERYONE. always hated managers customers. customers polite managers were. Right, that: there's idea anyone who's exceptionally intelligent idiot savant. Somehow, gotten people's heads talented at, say, math, also cursed abject social ineptitude.

/s wrong. opinion idea total elimination silly. always come back - heck NZ spread even borders closed everyone else. ask - days everyone go normal going hard lockdown days really solve anything? 

Where live (the UAE), approach test insane levels, trace home hotel quarantine. They've conducted close 6 million tests country, 100-200 new cases day densely populated country 10 million, hospitals overloaded whatsoever (in fact, private hospitals cases - they've pushed government hospitals). Masks mandatory absolutely everywhere risk large fines social distancing rules place, restaurants, bars (table service), beaches, cinemas etc operating normal. Furthermore, borders open, albeit strict rules around negative test flying upon landing. 

In opinion UAE/Korea approach way go - keep cases low manageable testing aggressively (the positive rate 0.3-0.4%), masks distancing rules, live fairly normally. NZ approach may make nice press (zero cases! longer zero cases), never seemed particularly sensible throw country lockdown every time there's handful cases. virus going disappear. 17 linked cluster 4 family members. Sure are. Close borders, restrict travel, things better.

Travel making individual measures useless. Also, cover valve, example, putting second surgical mask cotton mask it?

Exactly. use respirator put surgical mask exhale valve way that's worse surgical mask. Biden victory like switching band aids.

According various state mandates mask-wearing, distinction N95 masks types masks. facial coverings make covid even worse, expect various states update mask mandages. Honestly, you‚Äôre right, but, there‚Äôs always lowlifes accosting retailer workers nothing slights offenses, even pandemic. History tells us people stay home isolated, case count falls fast.

What we're trying find people became infected past weeks. see growth case counts next week sharp decline new cases. Us hotel workers, too.

Herd immunity dependent easily communicable virus is, Covid communicable listed above, using base pretty solid guess. Jackwagons like kids, school either hated teachers thought little them. nowadays feel bad since always get short end every stick. shit pay, shit days, got shit, blaming others makes angry. Take easy see happens. covid alienate huge portion population can't learn like that. Many people need person learning. No, arbiter usage, proper usage.

Lol. today, Karen's would want talk captain forced get life raft, and, ""mu freedums"" would deny ship sinking, whilst handing billionaires rafts. 250k people. close quarters. large percentage overweight toying diabetes. average death rate .7% age ranges.

Let's bump death rate around 1% - 1.5% since older crowd filled potential pre-existing conditions. 

So that's 2,500 - 3,750 deaths, more, rally, within months time.

Statistics lie.

Quick downvote scary. always found strange shop quickly, get shit need get fast.

The fact people time chit chat, scream abuse workers leave blows mind. That‚Äôs case fatality rate flu, IFR. hostile.....

If appreciate China's efficient work must part anti China foreign forces establishment. Yeah, parties involved done patting back saying support us. seems bitter reminder pandemic still thing, though we're somehow partly responsible  I‚Äôm guessing like flu - mutates different strains allows possibility reinfection. understand you‚Äôve become one conspirating maniacs pushing away science favor fucking strawman falacy Time quit Yeah, let's elect another rich ass creepy attitude towards women asshole. would fix things New Zealand entered game again. Delivery part reason they're grumpy they're paying 50% premium something could've cooked better home tried even once.

Not always true. us live apartments. things cook things limited heat burner. wok hei me. sometimes wrong. wife returned work hospital said numerous doctors wearing masks entering patients' rooms. I'm sorry say also moronic doctors Probably think smart move. criticism Russian vaccine lacks clinical trial. Solution, clinical trials verify effectiveness. Notice: **""expected vaccinated early May 2021.""** known since January China already de-confirmed it. Maybe actually hate ignorant audience? But....my hamburders live US? Oh customer guy try go cashier informed light last. got ear full manager me! "" would like standing 6 hours straight probaly need piss like race horse!?"" inner Karen comes appropriate. righteous suited upper class self quickly found another line. ubiquitous way shitty radio stations play shitty music one and... well get it. Every American speak tells jobs like entry level jobs college kids people working temporarily, deserve minimum wage, otherwise choose get better job elsewhere. 

I understand works, supposed get jobs pay better, become standard every non executive position? jobs pay living wage? get called socialist though. lack empathy people staggering. possible Chinese individuals, affected Chinese virus, infected European virus, since proven European significantly different Chinese one ? feels.... don‚Äôt know. would wager actually NZ someone telling lie. virus doesn‚Äôt literally magically spring nowhere. reckon quarantine broken somewhere, somehow, international traveller supposed hotel quarantine, no-one fessed yet.

I think it‚Äôs interesting consider hypotheses - frozen goods import hypothesis probably best one, even seems tad unlikely. ‚Äúsilent transmission‚Äù across 100 days??? actually don‚Äôt buy it. thing infectious, people NZ living life almost totally normal interactions last 100 days. passed around, people would getting it, people would getting sick, would growing spreading quite quickly. Silent undetected spread results ‚Äúout nowhere‚Äù case 20-30 days later? Yeah, see possible transmission chain. 100 days? don‚Äôt buy it.

So yeah - think see link hotel quarantine sooner later. Whether unintentional, someone lied contact tracers, remains seen. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs lack intelligence it‚Äôs rather spite like pisses left even harms well. That's exactly use services, fuck wants pay priced groceries top delivery fee top tip? ass, use it. take happy butt store shop myself. Heart attacks real Covid. 

But yes, know. saying asymptomatic gets hospital bit funny.

A months ago rash anosmia symptoms, now. 

I've sick 6 months thousands others experience symptoms. heart problems hair loss stingy veins vessels people even vision loss apparent reason. real, fear morgering take time acknowledge like took time acknowledge respiratory (only) disease. know got better employment protection laws, better holidays better work conditions etc Europe? Trade unions collective bargaining. know every American start shouting ""communist"" soon hear that? they've brainwashed generations propaganda serve corporate masters expense. many Americans say us Europeans somehow ""weak"" working 60 hours per week getting sacked whim petulant twat boss, parents grandparents fought rights protections. Americans prepared fight die far lands freedom others fucking noble. Please fight too, worth it. one party saying trying power. must new politics. work healthcare. know shifted non latex gloves allergies. still use latex fit better starting IVs, switching non latex people allergies. legal fees would exceed potential damages. Results line similar study Italy. find 1-2% fatality rate quite terrifying. LMFAO, funniest part overweight diabetic ""bikers"" are.

LMFAO, hospitals gonna full while!

LMFAO said, I've cried twice watching PM Health Minister speak. I'm proud it, I've pretty starved competence transparency leadership sense community camaraderie.

:( made sad. feeling pretty shit news community transmission dropped, American doctor follow Twitter moved recently celebrating even national health response. NZ nowhere near perfect fair share nutters - especially since second lockdown put effect, people organising protests everything - expect anything less government NZer. really hope positive changes come upcoming election guys. It‚Äôs nonsense think uv cure someone like Trump said. well know uv disinfects surfaces, can‚Äôt ‚Äúclean body‚Äù uv. would kill killing virus. hundreds millions Americans. Going kick number 5 digits really noteworthy. maybe obese people start exercising, eat helathy lose wait, reduce risk dying Covid diseases? happened UK. start lockdown period whole thing people would stand doorsteps every Thursday night 8 'applaud NHS heroes', cheered encouraged government dismally failing provide PPE dealt virus front lines.

All people lauded heroic 'key workers', delivery drivers, supermarket staff, hospital cleaners, course low pay like newly acknowledged crucial status going change that. I'm open carry state would carry. many cases people committing mass shootings. many expect return fire trained soldier? far diffusing situation find calm deadpan tone effective constant eye contact. Charge customers $5-10 fee per order

Works well people fixed incomes can't really increase bills. people also usually vulnerable. 16 yo son currently does, Florida less, since county mandated masks responsible stopping people without entering. He's 5'9 weighs maybe 116 WTH gonna do?! modelling indicates time case unknown sources makes testing, virus already circulating time. I've seen one top experts, Dr Michael Baker, say July 31 likely date virus re-appeared NZ. Piss  Proud American.... essential worker frontline ( nurse here) human anymore. expendable cogs risk lives white collars got extra 600 stay home got nothing extra 100 bucks 2 pay checks risk life.  logic could say government imprison serial killer might end killing people. perhaps broke arm. heart attack. case fair say zero covid symptoms. 

You're right know speculation pointless appear fear mongering. Gotta keep workers demotivated energy improve seek better opportunities. Make sure tie health insurance work well might actually die leave shitty job. spicy? Love spicy chicken. getting educated/trained finding better opportunities rather blaming system allowing college student side job function full time career? Well...

&amp;#x200B;

Then problem finding job guess. information linked applies whole europe BTW, Germany Picture statement leave doubt guy suffers severe brain damage. nano sharks lasers People use words literally arbiter [proper Correct I'm wrong India 3 weeks lockdown right?

Sorry rise cases too, hopefully countries get latest outbreaks control. Best luck you! Plumbers trashcollecters essential doctors nurses heard one thing them. said 10,000 per day US end August. People said nuts cases declined. deaths might ""baked in"".

Or, corona fatigue hit, peoplet get tested anymore. Tough work, less tests conducted. Different reporting standards.

And then, 200 deaths per day, week, becomes 800 per day. 1400 day. 3000 day (if nothing changes, people give go back normal, schools open). always happen like - we've seen - happened.

The thing is, always massive behavioral changes gets bad. we're told changes anything. always ""T-cell immunity"". Well, let's say jury's still that. Quite possibly, behavioral changes made big difference.

If Florida Texas (and knows what's going Brazil) want run experiment first time minimal behavioral changes, might see hit 2,000+ deaths per day sooner think. Like snowball mountain.

We'll see.

I think could still get next weeks.

I go back 2020 flu season exist. social distancing made big difference account for. Let's see truly happens otherwise. NZ even wearing masks social distancing, number flu cases 70% last year due lack international travel, hand washing after-effects lockdown. Year | Heart attack | 9/11 Cancer

No. certain countries within EU. get there? mean wings get China? Ship? know ships coronavirus?  test source testing destination tells end result came about. world full people major ego problems idea even means. 

We need start teaching kids better human beings school able identify we, humans, behave longer acceptable modern times. 

Society evolved faster ape brains able keep with. Would eat chicken though? much pondering time spend deep prayer supply side Jesus, wonder? could done every country did, restrict number people store, mandate face masks, get rid unnecessary positions like ""baggers"", ban people store follow rules. Pretty simple. department VP wants us go back office. work office campus 7500 people. I‚Äôm convinced believes thing hoax doesn‚Äôt care safety. sucks. want look new job. wall makes lot sense now.

I guess ""humor"" failed badly. understand that.   Seriously. I'm it. Although, actually, personal experience life pre post immuno- suppression touching face completely life changing thing. single sniffle cold anything entire time day lost immune system (and stopped touching face) pandemic. can‚Äôt forget role modern diet problem ~~Spanish~~v Flu bro? took test negative antibodies. contact someone COVID back early March though, bit short breath (may due lazy slowly going shape). Maybe it, asymptomatic negative antibodies, maybe never it. nearly lost voice going around circles trying tell someone this. keeps focusing idea mortality rate low, worry it? 

I truly know get understand despite deaths 'low' people suffer long term issues. (his response ""the virus around months, say anybody suffers long term issues?"") Yeah, explicitly came post said process dictated public know best.

Fuck that, democracy, people process.

Look experts achieved. delayed testing. failed produce data growth mortality rates. lied masks. They've taken half year clinical trials, keep tiny number people trials safe, hundreds thousands die US, millions die world wide.

Maybe there's making large policy decisions medical degree? highly unlikely least one vaccines work, assholes' contribution pandemic millions deaths trillions damages. phrased wrong. collective you. Personally got US gov job EU get yet keep access benefits lol. may go complete Expat eventually. big numbers are, still invisible people size country. 

Unless work health care afflicted friends/family, crisis probably direct view. inconvenience countermeasures impact people. easy people ignore problem, let grow big anyone ignore, point still find way wrong thing. 

It's ignorance short-sightedness let nation stay kind war past decades. Trillions dollars spent, thousands military members dead maimed, hundreds thousands civilians dead overseas... routine, boring, business usual. one pays attention President drops MOAB, pay attention day. 

The pandemic challenge current American spirit incapable countering. confront it. simply endure it... planeload planeload. thought Cyrus worst virus Con-Air. r/iamverysmart

Edit: btw severe asthma wear mask 10 hours day job. I‚Äôm perfectly fine. everyone else. Still hoping Olympics seems. good antibody test America commercial lab. I'm sure equally good tests Europe. problem anti-body test test. literally antibodies. everyone got infected produced antibody response, everyone maintained detectable levels antibodies several months.

It's pretty clear Europe fire early mid-February places. We're 6 months time. young, healthy population get sick minimal immune response, going miss entire segment test now. 

The best thing really cobble together numbers few, relatively solid sets numbers. Take number deaths multiply 100 200. actual number infections almost certainly fall within range. would 4-8 million UK, 6-12% population. well pourous, so....if one sick wearing pourous mask, sure....but amount spread lessened, risk reaaaly lessened wear mask, hopefully pourous persons.

all comes type mask imagine cold stare House would give someone saying wearing mask infringing freedoms.  Baton Rouge, I'm surprised. think fine people Lousiana news acting fool, reminds people:

 2024? need anti-mask idiots reach Herd Immunity [Two June 20-July 13 June 6-June 29. ""sometime May"". course number infected going rise time; unfortunately number detectable antibodies may drop months.

The UK [back baseline Week 27/June 29, close baseline Week 23/June 1. indicating infection essentially stopped mid May early June. number infected antibody test probably quite low. necessarily. wouldn‚Äôt high rates obesity comorbidities, known contribute death/hospitalization rates. Scientists: ""We observed cases formite (contact) tranmission""

Contact Tracers: ""It's almost impossible determine formite source transmission"". 

This lot cases labelled ""close contact"" identify transmitted. people close together while. also small significant proportion that's labelled ""unknown"" transmitted. 

New Zealand currently investigating new cases caused formite.  Anyone resorts violence wearing mask deserves jail time. Numbers steadily decreasing, soon solved minimal fuss. model entire nation? Kids got Corona? one check I.D.? thought compare flu agree, proof peace mind lol stay well! Indoor dining.
Bars.
Offices.
Schools.

It issue.

The last two actually worse. There's interested (but yet peer reviewed afaik) paper posits perviously unknown gene causes weird Covid selection. idea come paper, never checked it. Whittier girls prettier. feel like implies hundreds people work food processors (10x many positive cases COUNTY three fast food places) matter. corrections officers matter. farm workers matter.. even get mention. 

Use headline get attention need to, least mention 80 workplaces, largest ones factories prisons. consider racist criticize Singaporeans Americans. perspective, neither American, Singaporean. seems racist criticize Americans Singaporeans. Keeping mind immigrant nations made kinds races, nothing race.  colleges starting early September 1st they‚Äôd open. We‚Äôll see impact first week September sure  wish brave enough go brow place. weird states reporting cases deaths per capita last month Republican governors. guess secretly love Joe? /s comes different statement currently formatted. hope understand that. prefer Brawndo Yea, yea

It‚Äôll broken soon. I‚Äôm surprised anymore. Unsurprising like drop NBA game viewership Literally what's said since 1st cases US.

Authorities unwilling increase testing problem starts top. actual study here, doesn‚Äôt really say article headline claims does. study looks initial outbreak New York, stats covid overall.  ruthless advisor [Dominic somewhat concerned. new employees since universal masking started I'm shitty faces names. worried trouble unmasked. steadily going down, good news.

Between hard take number without bucket load salt....what really need information transparency numbers meaning...ie: much lag test submitted results posted? actual negative numbers adjusted retests, many tests virus tests vs antibody tests, etc... Good news area , really doesn‚Äôt get unbearably cold weather Christmas- 70+ prolly mid late October Yup govt putting millions (maybe even billions) fast-track manufacturing. think US promised ~100m Oxford vaccine doses end October. works, administer immediately. doesn't, sunk cost US would bomb bodies citizens? vaccine antibodies disappear quickly? It‚Äôs called child endangerment Coronavirus serious disease since Spanish Flu terms severity even Top 10 Mankinds history. Obviously still dangerous take seriously let's go comparing much worse pandemics wasn‚Äôt declaration :p still awesome stays like much want say ""no shit"", actually important. stay home orders *weren't* effective, we'd want know. Plenty stuff counterintuitive, important check 'duh doy' possibilities much ""holy shit"" ones. Name doesn‚Äôt checkout. 250% drop something?  100% drop would mean zero active. think missed point. Reread second sentence. really wonderful person. Thank you, wish people could introspection, maybe right Yes, let‚Äôs pretend don‚Äôt 11 times deaths per capita neighbors. difference continues grow. 

Pretty ignorant declare victory haven‚Äôt even come level nordics since May. Excuse me, everyone months steady saying statistics fake. So... know help you. weird part white vs ethnicities comes sunlight need less gain more. skin color evolved time repel harmful rays. comes virus like that‚Äôs ass backwards, see weird effects. really strange virus. I'll go slight uptick, spike. assume people live close family already seen going change they're Thanksgiving. still travel, assume way compared previous years. mom's neighbor husband covid twice now. January testing anybody (she meetings people China) July. tested positive antibodies twice got second time. Definitely two different strands (the original one China one going around now), still worrisome. may want steer clear family. though Antibody tests notoriously unreliable.

We building house cards them? numbers coming down, well done! level stupidity even legal there!? dont need that. guys already published JAMA NY. might depend local culture (freedumbs) lot go business.  bought China, China fakes numbers! So, scam! 

/s number came phase 1/2 data. info needed. Let's hold declarations phase 3, designed get handle efficacy, completed published.

Neutralising antibody responses SARS-CoV-2 detected 32 (91%) 35 participants single dose measured MNA80 35 (100%) participants measured PRNT50. booster dose, participants neutralising activity (nine nine MNA80 day 42 ten ten Marburg VN day 56). Neutralising antibody responses correlated strongly antibody levels measured ELISA (R2=0¬∑67 Marburg VN;  article bad. 

What study says is: ‚Äú

Few persons US frame reference historic levels excess mortality currently observed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.1 study, excess deaths New York City peak 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic compared initial period COVID-19 outbreak.

...

This cohort study found absolute increase deaths baseline (ie, excess mortality) observed peak 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic higher comparable observed first 2 months COVID-19 outbreak New York City.

However, baseline mortality rates 2017 2019 less half observed 1914 1917 (owing improvements hygiene modern achievements medicine, public health, safety), relative increase early COVID-19 period substantially greater peak 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic.

...

These findings suggest mortality associated COVID-19 early phase New York City outbreak comparable peak mortality observed 1918 H1N1 influenza Really groundbreaking stuff. Thanks Tedros. You‚Äôre font useful knowledge pandemic.   I've heard people like you, never actually came across one. Wouldn‚Äôt dramatically lower fatality rate? I'm fan outdoor heaters though, seems like massive waste electricity. honestly mind able eat summer seasonal thing, ordering take-outs winter (assuming, course, restaurants survive kind business). 35 down, many go?  Exactly! thought chronic fatigue syndrome! 

Fixing vitamin *not* fix daily pain, though. actually start lifting make dent that.  test positive yesterday Texas. barely left house past week. I‚Äôve done curbside pickup groceries 3 weeks ago. haven‚Äôt bars clubs restaurants twice order take delivered. wear mask minute step outside go somewhere. quarantine, happily, apartment past almost 5 months working home. details apply gf well. still got it! don‚Äôt understand.

The thing think got stopped ONE time homeless man asking change running outside. That‚Äôs time don‚Äôt wear mask I‚Äôm running I‚Äôm assuming it. running mask deemed necessary CDC didn‚Äôt it.

And know even weirder part? gf tested negative TWICE! We‚Äôve even sex day sent test eventually tested positive. possible tested negative, breathed, cuddled, etc girlfriend whole week tested negative? doesn‚Äôt make sense. There's plenty people health conditions US. would say majority Americans least one condition obesity, diabetes, COPD, asthma, high blood pressure common. Stop testing deadness? high think PCRs done antibody, skews results direction. Here's info posted reddit. pandemic response requires people certain things. universal truth since beginning civilization. bible. proven history, proven countries. ignorant people resistant pandemic measures, element human nature also well-documented bible, told us specifically do. Guess bible says? Wear mask self-isolate. also word people refuse cooperate. word ""unclean"". honestly think worse 1918 flu, comparing tally one pandemic lasted 2 years one that's half year little tricky. We'll see another 1.5 years, suspect right. thinking lax border security, transmission via shipped items. One people infected works handling shipping considered think remote say don‚Äôt otherwise agree you. I‚Äôve called paranoid family members stringent washing hands avoiding touching surfaces. don‚Äôt care think - would rather boy cried wolf situation alternative. Dang it, made think warm fuzzy days school, gazing Ginger (and Maryanne) ...  covid genome database: *many* strains. Sweden mainly three different strains circulating right now. two reports full genome sequencing Swedish samples: strains appear different enough behave differently humans.  That's brother, nurse, contracted Covid. He's rehab nurse, got recalcitrant, aphasic, stroke patient kept kicking screaming spitting refusing keep mask on. 

Brother N95, ppe. sick within days, patient transferred died shortly after. Face shields cheap Amazon... get 10 $30. keep eyes fully protected environment in. Pick KN95s put homemade covers them.

Please whatever need stay safe. Best luck. say hard like shutting everything indefinitely correct way things. properly developed countries, possible. simply possible America. I'm aware would get virus control.... would also cost millions people homes. Donald?.... dat u? schools would able open üò£ Looks like might need hcq malaria /s Outside race 8th/9th West, reason watch really. I'm tuning playoffs though. EXACTLY. Imagine come perspective safe enough open schools first, start opening stuff school openings worked out.  stand earlier judgement. PA close Gyms, Bars, indoor dining, gatherings people months... Let's get mad though college football might happen!!! sadly. Tag ‚Äòem bag ‚Äòem. ride full sh*tters spitters. That's technically possible even disease higher rate transmission lower fraction asymptomatic cases. game probability, that's all. population large enough, sorts bizarre situations occur. Yep, still flu. old first go. Given enough time infections, virus mutate multiple parallel strains. 

Imagine getting COVID-19 every 6 months finally kills you. 

You'll see headlines, (not personally probably dead already). headlines read: New record COVID-19 infections survived single person: 6 talking about? I'm talking spread coronavirus stop it. Soon americans lose patience start dumb stuff increase spreading rate. Buddy, they‚Äôre already drinking 4-lokos  Lies. fatality rate COVID almost certainly closer 0.5% 1%. seen ""Jesus Camp""? literally stated one mom (I think mom). Says Muslims raising child soldiers, Christians. US could less maybe ~~children~~ ~~white children~~ *white affluent* children start dying France 19% positive rate? test less case control. That's situation Southern US. point can't big outbreak still protecting vulnerable. treatments massively improved time.

What treatments percentage difference made? point claim 78% people contract COVID-19 permanent damage.

I'm simply stating real reason concerned ongoing cardiac sequelae COVID-19 infection, given significant fraction patients study sick enough hospitalized still abnormal findings cardiac MRI 70 days initial positive test.  see, totally covid19 unrelated pneumonia deaths, nothing wrong it! burger location typically lines hundreds yards long drive 20-50 people lined takeaway. bet hardly made dent it. People love out. Imagine done back March April. We'd stronger economy today tens thousands Americans dead. SSID? hear - congenital lung disease. Hope safe healthy. What's drill getting back home? way viruses might happen objects brought outside, residue clothes, shoes, sunglasses, hair etc air occasional contacts surroundings. Obviously hands considered dirty, therefore, smartphone keys dirty too. So, handle it? Genocide us Europe trying limit use heaters. good climate eating outside January Scandinavia insane waste resources outside pandemic.

With respect balancing check book I'm talking arithmetic basic concepts. ""I can't overdrawn, still checks"" problem. 

I've taxes 45 years. think that. 

My point schools let young people parents. Go r/Cooking time year see number kids heading school idea feed themselves. worse year meal plans generally option. Every individual presumed right make evaluation personal risk acting world (at least democratic society). 

Individuals evaluate risk, deeply personal matter integrates experience, knowledge, personality, culture, decide walk outside, go school, eat particular food, take particular medication, accept particular treatment, wear wear particular garment, express express image themselves, particular social interactions, adopt work pastime, on.

On flip side, fundamental indignity one person/authority impose evaluation risk individual, one basis science, smaller multitude risks common often created condoned persons/authorities. imposition risk individual society becomes reasonable magnitude risks, actions taken reduce risks, sufficiently shown substantiated impositions favor common good (not confused greater good).

As whether risks allude negligible, worthy consideration, well time tell. Yeah, watch gas pump handles too. part?

In response Governor Beshear's recommendation delay in-person instruction September 28, 2020, Board Education approved amended school calendar 20-21 school year. ¬†To reallocate planning days teachers staff, first day school Monday, August 31. ¬† Honestly? 'Seriously doubt' safe, considering crazy rushed many steps skipped. image explain US. Lol suggested injecting disinfectant, that's better opinion. That's potential growth. Reff 3 (which likely) cases would go day: 4 12 36 108 324 972 etc. No. said number actual deaths occur given day right 20. reason figure reported 100 add people died weeks ago daily figures, current method counts death registered, actually died.

The issue PHE figures simply check list people diagnosed COVID, check see people still alive. they're dead, go COVID death regardless actually died. means that, time, COVID 100% fatal according PHE counting methods, everyone ever die eventually.

Having gone back PHE figures, determined 5,000 46,000 people counted COVID deaths COVID recovered died something else. even full lockdown even still people moaning nothing would go anyway. 

You also still people refuse wear masks. Also one claiming wanted use ""forever"" stop strawmanning. 

If competent leader Americans actually committed lockdown like NZ (and island nothing success handling virus) probably could eradicate it. problem government support people work, small businesses making sure food farmers dump well enough. hope guys vote office.

""China gets upset coronavirus exported imported"" steal. sounds like actually friend's problem lacks human empathy. 

You're good dude. feel same. consequence health policies, lockdown well media inducing fear. many cancer patients missed appointments PURPOSE afraid catching COVID thus died. 

Blaming virus alone intellectually dishonest; Government Media must held accountable well. set another record daily deaths. i'd agree big 10. think pac-12 want deal player organization, even stood sec/acc possibility playing much easier cancel kick problems next year. Asymptomatic spread fairly rare.

Not true all. Unless study linked. saving grace Ebola thing years ago, people got planes United States, able spread it, could spread without showing symptoms, one nurse ended infecting anybody, probally reason. Remember freaked out, TWO people died United States? US government completely failed build sort national testing infrastructure need limit tests *stop case count increasing country.

The global pandemic making life harder?

Unbelievable! figure own?

Source! would ~10x reported cases, meaning real mortality ~10x lower derived known cases/deaths.

Why nobody talking fact may vastly overestimate mortality rate? Routine dental checkups pay bills.

Which dentists push even evidence efficacy mediocre non-existent. guess it‚Äôs trade off. Faster time test results, information actionable also undetected spreading cases. heart it, would better increase increase lab resources continue tests. know heart it, political move give perception virus abating.

Doing whatever want use crisis try make buck abuse/kill poors minorities process...  America always done/stood for. estimate puts 3.4M infected. official death count 41329, would give IFR 1.2%

 That's also ignoring excess deaths, UK around 64K end June. Even ignore deaths July, puts IFR 1.9%. Either estimate seems low, virus hit elderly vulnerable extremely hard. existing antibodies capable binding virus body, they‚Äôre capable picked tests people using look SARS-COV-2 antibodies. study looks pretty iffy me.

I time go address issues, one quick note assumes people behaved differently five states question ""non lockdown"" states. states may statewide orders, majority big cities within states did.

I'll leave theories. ;) Die what? That's make gov evil honestly, raise bar evil everytime. 

The non-voter actually right. way change mass no-vote. way expose undemocratic system trying use democracy fool people. Damnit gotta start cooking chicken wings now? best friend signed trial. update significant findings side effects. Many people area getting/have gotten it. 

So far, heard people pain injection site &amp; chills first night. actually 50-100 deaths though, point. Actual deaths per day hovering 20s weeks, numbers consistently inflated backlogged cases weeks months ago. 

After review, decided deaths actually caused COVID, clearly PHE's method counting results 100% fatality rate COVID time (because everybody ever gets put COVID death die), resulting 5,000 death reduction.

People take 28 days die still counted COVID death certificate. Wouldn‚Äôt traditional excess deaths also way due Covid though? blurs things. 

Vehicle deaths likely way much less people driving result shelter place orders. 
Traditional flu also dropped sharply due social distancing measures look positivity rates, you‚Äôll see they‚Äôre high, 10%, indicating we‚Äôre testing enough. wildest thing is, point good treatments reduce morbidity! Real, scientifically verified advances. panacea morons still flock snake oil. researchers, clear individuals respond better others SARS-CoV-2 differential response virus suggests individual patient, unique characteristics, heavily influences Covid-19 disease severity,"" said think lung immune system differs Covid-19 patients, understanding patients' lung immune systems helpful harmful, may able help physicians proactively manage risk-patients,"" noted. 

This sounds promising. don‚Äôt understand it‚Äôs controversial though. I'm sorry dad. see time, we're getting little better managing there's long way go, especially patients requiring ICU 1 2 months time. supposed waystop stabilize enough move less intense setting, patients legit need ICU long term. Better jobs almost always need degrees types schooling. ""I read book library"" going get job.

People stuck minimum wage jobs much harder time going school need continue working feed provide shelter themselves, taking away school time. Yes.   Yeah, I‚Äôd agree Here‚Äôs explanation: guy real expertise immunology pulling shit ass. 

There‚Äôs reason think wouldn‚Äôt antibodies previously existing cross reactive cells. Possibly. germaphobe, buy one too. never would entertained idea rally OK. think gets annoyed anyone coughing sneezing around him. Still waiting response, guy... probably alarmist time, would people known differently wen never experienced virus likely told needed mask. Apologies something societal norm treated something societal norm. people virus previously thought wouldn‚Äôt lower fatality rate? Honestly idea. work Covid unit anything getting blood donations. 

Though monetary incentive would probably 
increase donations. understanding donation results 2 units convalescent plasma.

But think hospitals money donations doubt government would give monetary incentive pretty much goodness individuals society donations. 

I say primarily hospital work red year due increased cost PPE, hiring surge staff, loss revenue canceled elective procedures like surgery, Interventional Radiology, Cath Lab beginning pandemic.

I know like hospitals CEO stated we're $11 million deficit due pandemic. figure hospitals SoCal. confirm. work Kroger West TN, eight years I‚Äôve company, I‚Äôve never seen despondency among coworkers. store alone, we‚Äôve already multiple confirmed cases COVID-19. Store management downplayed threat countless times people drop like flies. older gentleman ‚Äòs company many years recently became ill store, trying continue shift. customer actually walked associate getting sick restroom, saw state in, informed worker. Alarmed, particular coworker mine informed management, promptly ridiculed said associate. also told couldn‚Äôt getting sick, ‚Äúwe business run.‚Äù So, yeah. could wrong here. would think dimmer switch like effect. Even 20-30% start see reduced rate transmission. However like said reasonable level people would consider herd immunity probably around 50-70%.

The good news said correct. percentage immunity within community rises progressively slow rate infection. community 25% would still see spread. nearly rapidly 5%.

While thats ideal, keep spread slow masks such. Bolstered level herd immunity. would lot keep hospitals overwhelmed.

Of course everyone remain cautious. Keep masks distance. turns slow burn vaccine better therapeutics would positive. Rather colossal shitstorm every time. You‚Äôre wrong original definition, things change 70 years, like definitions words, fits category. Germans ORDERLY. thing efficient. Yeah, no. time 3000 deaths china total considered sign chinese system was.

Fun fact: never heard anybody doubt chinese numbers overtaken western numbers. ""they needlessly oppressive welding people appartments"" - later ""wah wah cannot possible deaths them, lying!!""

Hopefully making worse, push enough people reject certain structures we've dealing with. enough people simply refuse, things *have* change.

Imagine grocery store workers could unite akin unionization. Sure, may easily replaceable individual (everyone is, everywhere), scale, not. Also scale, shift culture.

Maybe meeting that's interested that's fine... interested night. Yes, course lot people think they're safe washing hands clue aerosol spread. well people China say doing. ins outs dating

Their partners must glad came. Actually real number likely higher still. Activities reduce spread tend reduce types death - meaning covid casualties excess deaths.

And long term health effects. seeing %ages 70s 80s damage critical organs. Times 5m counting. noticeably reduce life expectancy numbers long term. perspective countries rookie numbers. Comparing Sweden averaging around 100 deaths / day equivalent US would around 3000 deaths / day. equivalent Belgiums highest deaths reates would around 10000k deaths / day.

But comparing deaths per country day day basis stupid. US never reach smaller countries death rates country. states might. worse laws passed 9/11 protect US

*It get peak (April time) get pick 2 3 months, amount preparation knowledge vitally important* 

&amp;#x200B;

We started peaking June, plateau since like early July, clearly impact close 10 deaths day average, came months good numbers gave enough time Covid dedicated Hospital made better prepared general.

Some people say closed soon, think preferable closed late much worse situation. realize can't hide dead? Lol said anything pay? Pay need to. there's 16% unemployment, hard find workers.

You sure making lot assumptions voting.

Who said kids? really think I'd spending much time reddit? No, I'm furloughed one building anything right bored mind.

Sure prove right lack common sense. wholeheartedly believed corona. really wonder it‚Äôs true know immunity. So...but still, getting could leave lifetime illness good? Bad? don‚Äôt know.

Considering tests still really accurate take far long actually work, Antibody tests useless can‚Äôt even get ‚Äúgimmie‚Äù cases right (I.e. people proven covid still don‚Äôt show antibody tests), literally fucking idea many cases have.

I doubt near 200 million, also think every expert throws 10x number fucking full shit blindly guessing don‚Äôt understand could contracted it. Maybe someone coughed left particles air breathed in. strange said taking grain salt. it‚Äôs untrue. case might well happening.

there moves sound really strange - like fact told us wear masks trains shops :)... seriously can't figure what's going there.

/s

Keep spewing party line. great, enlightening article. forgot add police officer list. Gotta teach whistleblowers early guess. great example school teaching kids given current crisis. lot people use Brussels shortname European Union

Thank precision! French knew case, since sadly imposing masks (except *some* parts *some* major touristic cities, without sh\*tload complaints)... incredibly useful diferentiate two, guess Euronews used *Belgium* instead.

For know, called **metonymy (***a* *figure speech* *in thing concept referred name something closely associated thing concept*, Wikipedia). ^(Sorry digression, figures speech always favourite part French courses.) Right? Playing fucking peek-a-boo virus.

I think half US population understand object permanence applies things can't see naked eye well. landlord... deceased mother-in-law unpaid hospital bills. Asymomatic angle makes virus challenge. Ebola, SARS could infect you, unless showing direct symptoms. imagine SARS Ebola could spread asymptomaticly, like COVID could. ""Return virus sender, love, world"" I'm talking underestimate terms number infections, IFR.

If anything, IFR overestimate vulnerable populations disproportionately infected. entire population affected equally, IFR would lower. That's assuming long gap lockdowns again. Hes probably Canada. didnt receive one either job considered ""essential"". 

So people stayed home made $2000 month safe little bubble still go make shitty minimum wage. 

CERB benefits fucking Canada. 4 seperate business owners friends cant find anybody show would rather sit home smoking weed playing call duty collecting CERB cheque. trying say USA cooperative allowing COVID thrive there? not. told covid ""come in, care"". now, pull vaccine tried best act reasonable. 

this reason sort punishment. 

this also well shown CO2 treatment - countries ""pay"" CO2 produce. point someone finally came conclusion bit unfair strong industrial countries live wealth, crashing earth producing sort consequences mostly suffer industrialized strong.  
i know co2 thingy worth well, show principle i'm trying point here. care, pay price. Wear mask social distance. got really excited thought title BBC headline moving positive cases families govt controlled quarantine facilities

could imagine tried US? would end gun battle feel like grocery stores develop apps stores. time need associate know something is. store app, need interact thus could productive. ^ shilltastic mean, that's quite apple oranges comparison. 1.4% getting horrible incurable disease (even fatal now) per event (per intercourse) vs 0.9-1.6% chance once, chance essentially zero young comorbidities. And, fair, people freaking corona, international tourism heavily restricted/masks compulsory every country public spaces large events forbidden. believe we've ever put restrictions like global scale.  Majority site couldn‚Äôt vote bush wanted to. try find link could wrong overwhelmed much misinformation currently truth hidden bullshit read article month ago tests first ""confirmed"" cases COVID-19 UK majority ""recovered"" still feeling effects believe 3-4 months recovery. Right I'm saying surgical mask allow air leave sides valve would. Yeah pandemic really highlighted people really unhygienic almost proud it. won‚Äôt get parents still let children touch everything grocery store...or adults same!

I accumulated lot masks wearing several hours day, plan keep wearing future going stores public places, especially winter. already get flu shot every year, making mask part routine another way mitigate risk. Shocker, post history USA bad China good non-American, agree True, almost cases, possible implement practices limit, completely stop close interaction. I'm saying would stop spread, would limit it. Unfortunately, probably dream now. many vectors, many contagious people. possible March, early April. mid April... 

A hard fast lockdown still might get numbers place contact trace quarantine infectious potentially infected people. though letting run course kill hundreds thousands... Holy cow haven‚Äôt paying attention since 2016. People resigned DNC rigging election. admitted court obligation fair follow bylaws. Internal documents show colluded media create narratives major news give Sanders less exposure give Trump more, HRC campaign could go Trump. violated campaign finance laws taking maxed donations state DNC party + national + HRC campaign (something like $300k pop) funneling directly campaign.

This cycle vote tallying app first state made company headed someone directly linked one campaigns. Surprise, votes tallied app show person won, even match person proof vote. Polling places heavy Sanders areas closed, increasing lines ones still open. Old retired boomers sit line day vote. Young millennials rent kids can‚Äôt. Voting machines trivial exploit people hacking convention. easy think people buy machines? Where‚Äôs paper trail, verification vote? Oh doesn‚Äôt exist? Weird.

Then end day, party calls around candidates Super Tuesday tells drop endorse Biden. Magically, entire states didn‚Äôt even campaign offices went way. Taken individually could say ‚Äúwell didn‚Äôt change votes it‚Äôs rigged‚Äù take added 50 thumbs scale you‚Äôre wondering never get want. Dude, voters ALWAYS lose. winning due American pride intelligence. According predictions, cases start spiking approximately ten years ten days. God, going clusterfuck. 

When started, figured people would responsible able regulate social interactions enough worry holidays. People would look unique year got stay home local holiday instead big family one.

That aint going happen. People going travel asses fuck things even already are. 

Fuck me, man. wish dump bucket common sense people wake fuck reality. WH trying since march get data come straight them. says cases going go down. means it. Anyway possible still would mind beeing plumber funny twitter account though...

&amp;#x200B;

That would much less dangerous one puts mask sunglasses instantly rejoices feeling anonymity, invisibility, something. Saving big lip gloss. one see yawn. roll eyes. Completely blemish free every day. smile weird people polite. forget carry mask frequently I'm getting better kinda like it.

Why crazy people worry surveillance state love shit? lack good social safety net U.S., strain individuals' lives well. back everything first starting anything locked down. game reserved GameStop paid long Covid stuff even started hit. (Yes, know.) 

Everything far unknown changing hour back then, know shut going happen area. called store at, got answers asking said ""Please stay safe can."" something like that.

His response made bawl. "" know, first person said since started. "" grateful.

And made mad like, damned video game. worth someone's life. Yes, put money trying figure logistics getting time shut happened way fault. like control game getting released early not.

Obviously grocery store anything sentiment applies just... Sad. Sad people care. actively make worse. I'll show construction site tell read book they'll hire spot. Right walk up, look manager eye, give firm handshake. accurate. hospital work part larger vaccine study phase 3. countries organizations working vaccine well. Please spread misinformation. landlord... deceased mother-in-law unpaid hospital bills.

(please read articles commenting them) explain declining hospitalization numbers across state? Texas almost 7k people hospitalized. It‚Äôs reduced pretty substantially since it‚Äôs peak around mid July (nearly 11k). rate hospitalizations per day lower well substantial amount. welcome, link interested: "" **D614G Spike Variant Alter IgG, IgM, IgA Spike Seroassay Performance**"" Definitely good news vaccine development perspective. issue idea false-negative rate either. 

They useful guess, population-level studies based information, especially antibody levels stay long, create major issue government make decision making on. important future look like.

Will like cold? get repeatedly sucks, rarely kills. flu, annual thing? know. also know long took common cold become annoyance killer. Natural selection may eliminated segment population vulnerable it.

Look what's happened every time isolated population exposed new disease that's normalized imaging culture. America's decimated disease, took decades native population stop dropping like flies, lasted long. reality concerned about. almost misread G String, LOL! overall social (and political) health canada leagues US ? One thing still confounds me.. US manage stay pack long flaws. WW free resources enough give big free meal (at least believe).

btw, nothing better hitting walls wake giants lead people symptoms AVOID test since, well, nobody \*wants\* put quarantine facility?

While look paper I'm afraid lead plenty people COVID avoiding tested thus spreading more. corona waiting turn around hiding box. üì¶ I'm pretty sure yes, worth mentioning. exhale valve. Air passes in. theory effect person wearing surgical mask mouth nose. surgical mask yo protect others exhale. n95 protect you. almost though gathering concentrated areas without masks bad idea given bad pandemic right now. 

Sure may harder catch corona hard surfaces, schools unsanitary fuck. Literally got sick every every week highschool. Got bad attended month senior year. Half year graduating stayed healthy gained 50 pounds. could imagine scary would environment god damn pandemic. 

You tired kids rubbing eyes eating food without constantly cleaning hands. Odds school time using hand sanitizer, list killing people 100. even students aren‚Äôt dying corona, could this. 

Also, corona live porous surfaces like fabric week. think kids cleaning backpacks get home? Changes clothes? Showering upon returning home?

Lastly, question, happening gym class given pandemic???  Yes. would end cheaper vast majority Americans actually. spend $150/wk health insurance, doesnt include $1k family deductible 20% pay *after* hit deductible. real damn shame one sees like lobbying another giant issue. many people understand. tested negative, think COVID-19 free life! Smh... scary thing dude convinced hair perfect. think could call results study estimate. estimate. Although, rounding upper confidence interval 1.65% 2% estimation based conclusions. guessing also, alternative would way worse. I‚Äòm German completely false. Please don‚Äôt spread wrong information like that... can't spell ""bleach""! expendable workers essential. Every time someone says cringe. we're hero's receive extra pay, pay catch covid, proper gear get sick. think covid passes us essential workers/hero's strike. Nurses, grocery store workers, gas station attendants, etc. Time rise heros public detractors

I've clinical depression since teenager, never ever depressed. feel stuck bleak. 


The day, lobby closed day drive-thru only, customer asked (in angry tone) would bother wearing masks customers even allowed inside time? looked annoyed answered keep safe...They even view essential workers human. reward essential working this? company tossing pathetic 100 buck 'hazard bonus' nearly enough literally worst time life. peoples job, pay them. ""Right work"" means job can't require join union, allowed strike. Teachers also can't strike states, two different laws.  many obese people consider obese? Would sympathy older person child could potentially get sick? I‚Äôm lawyer, but, believe defer payment since it‚Äôs federal tax.

That would mean least 4 years lost interest entire countries worth income tax. 

The coffers already low, payments (correct I‚Äôm wrong here) always increased match inflation. 

It‚Äôs kinda republican playbook defund something make useless, point say ‚Äúwhy funding this, look ineffectual is!‚Äù people follow them. paying 7.5% pot, earning back 0-5%, you‚Äôd want repealed, too.

And certainly founded another fing theocracy morally corrupt religious ""leaders"" palaces gold, mega yachts, private jets. Obviously, clearly strong tendency towards aged. Luckily, still enough cases contact tracing still option.   gonna keep ‚úã waving lieu defensible position? baddies?

Try again, troll. win due American pride intelligence lose due rigged elections?

Blaming China racist Ireland blaming Americans flareups racist. Caring parents would torture autistic child manner. patents worried needs, anyone elses.  Millenial here, can't fix things macro scale least try use campsite principle (leave things better shape found them).

If enough people net effect would enormous. edit title though? work grocery store, done nearly 8 years now.

The general public taking lot anger retail workers simply mandates state local governments enforced people enforcing them. people enforcing mandates employees.

Now, many employees paid minimum wage, college level degrees, 16 80+ years old trying get make ends meet. Yet, people much believe rights taken away someone wearing name tag.

They're also wear mask 8 hours day, yelled inconvenienced wear mask maybe 15 minutes, give take. what? Mental trauma possible financial hardships lose job confrontation check counter.

To say least: feel trapped, feel scared taking brunt anger based something fault. ads say ""Our workers heros hope great time store full great employees"" meanwhile employees smiling ""doing jobs"" ad held gunpoint smile fuck contained one family four yesterday?

...I fucking hate religion. America sounds like upset child. Yup Sweden also ranks 8th COVID-19 deaths per million. total herd immunity, probably. US government ever acted like don‚Äôt find people expendable? 

If 58% non obese people get (and I‚Äôm sure obese people successfully get vaccine well), US government trump really care obese die?

I hear trump ‚ÄúI mean come on, epidemic obesity right, kill 2 birds one stone‚Äù reason saying right now: everything needs cause that's whole life stay whole life exist universe. like anything here, bound laws rules. cannot apply laws rules like ""everything needs cause"" outside current universe. 

Think like dimensions way. late Carl Sagan put great way presenting example squares 2d surface able go left, right, down, however unable go forwards backwards like 3d cube would able to.

You can't apply rules laws universe things outside it. Funny story. don‚Äôt get paid summer. least state. yeah. We‚Äôre ten month employees. We‚Äôre contracted mid August mid June. Many us take second jobs summer make ends meet.

Any work teaching career summer isn‚Äôt paid. It‚Äôs choice. often make school year easier myself. 

And sitting home? Yeah, also no. district starting virtual. Monday started contractual days. I‚Äôve working day scheduled work day son goes bed. I‚Äôve working son naps weeks previous one. 

Let tell typical day house. get up. Shower. Work school stuff son gets up. husband showers breakfast son 8. takes go back work 9. watches son son naps 1. starts working job. work 4 (end contractual hours 9-4). son gets nap 4. parent thing including dinner son goes bed 8 husband continues work job. work evenings 2-3 hours son goes bed.

So don‚Äôt say I‚Äôm sitting home collecting paycheck. work paycheck. I‚Äôm tired lazy teacher bullshit.

And they‚Äôre impossible make vaccines for. There‚Äôs cattle vaccine another coronavirus, believe. salient point. Empires fall longer able handle changes, stresses, contradictions plaguing empire externally internally. Crisis 3rd Century nearly brought Rome. Romans unable adapt make needed changes. probably would collapsed 300 CE Aurelian Diocletian stepped made drastic, necessary changes.

We beginning ""Crisis 21st century"". one-fifth way in, we've gotten bogged 2 pointless (and immoral) wars, seen skyrocketing inequality, crisis leadership, failure institutions norms government, complete loss global soft power respect, hollowing production capabilities, we're hit global pandemic completely incapable addressing. begun see climate change rear head.

There necessary changes made society government critical America survive, need made yesterday. I'm cyncial look running president. Look congress. Look who's governors' mansions. importantly, look American peoples' attitudes towards COVID-19, huge, systemic problems hitting us. either think bad, think problem all, get hung ideas like ""well GOVERNMENT'S responsibility make people wear masks!"" I'd like think there's hope USA frankly see reason hope.  Looking comment history, never even tested thought it.

Next. seem understand contagious diseases work.

NZ put incredible effort thought successful pandemic response. irony want criticize them, 165,936 dead. also job retail industries enforce laws. lowest food chain currently busy core government competency get threatened, top often abysmal working conditions wages. Middle-aged lady here. loathe stuff, always tip extremely well. worked service industry family still work hospitality. know hard jobs grotesquely underpaid are. guys get tips me. 

During pandemic, I‚Äôve budgeting 25-30% tip (very) times I‚Äôve dined outdoors. It‚Äôs literally least staff forced serve me.

I‚Äôm saying pat back. I‚Äôm saying *everyone* same. aren‚Äôt, I‚Äôve seen people awful, should. worker bot. bot poorly executed fault system design. reality that's going long time? mean, seen coming. every place reporting cases, course someone gonna come forward it. big deal. Thank checking

Really, 40% would believe you. country terrifying. I'm European visited New York years ago, I'd always answer ""Fine, thanks. you"" that's polite thing someone asks (and understand something required employers, thought Americans extra friendly). retail workers definitely taken aback reaction. guess every employee every shop/restaurant/etc. keeps asking ""how doing"" obligation, kind loses meaning while, many people react anymore.  it‚Äôs social conditioning take economically productive people pay nothing, make problem leaving food stamps, allow people pushing ‚Äúunskilled laborer‚Äù narrative keep *all* money, large share it‚Äîit all.

Be careful that. Reddit likes emphasise certain things, like frontpage subreddit often full x random person getting attacked random person masks rather case lockdown

From understand, no, restrictions lockdowns vary state state. makes sense. lock state low numbers cases cases high another state? However government states seem accept high level cases rather implement lockdowns restrictions. Watch vaccine completed tomorrow sheer anger would attack dog.

Wehn back 2019 nobody need vaccine COVID19 though still need vaccines course Tetanus, Hib, Hepatitis B, meningitis, measles, many nasty things probably vaccinated already. Spain started masks mandatory 1.5 meter distance could observed, people wear city center sidewalks keeping distance clearly impossible. routinely crossing like 5-6 people per minute without masks 1 meter distance less. Unfortunately can't trust people make kind judgment, least (maybe Northern countries viable).

Then, regions Spain (by now, them) made mandatory regardless distancing zoom! 95% people wear masks city.

Of course, many people criticize measure said masks needed enough distance. point... perfect world people obey measures letter. real world, streets much safer coughed, sneezed talked short distance. What's long term complication rate beyond that? People often focus deaths forget covid leaves damage organs too. That's lot people afraid of, hospitals seeing people used before. People reconsidering....""is reeaaally bad enough need go there, use another choice wait?"" sacrifices people give lives normally.

I would really appreciate every kind help! could've made intelligent point without taking peasant route assuming everything racist name Cannibal Isle. What's mouth guard?! Susceptibility disease = severity infection, susceptibility infection. supposed do? u supposed drop everything life virus nobody could anything stay away ppl? u it? wouldn‚Äôt know good them. know wealthy people find opportunity instability. need get serious stay home prep bigger camps infected. consider numbers always 10x higher

That's valid approach looking antibody tests. Yup. could get unemployment would Los Angeles able get antibody test walking urgent care clinic free. neutered HR assistance

Well HR protect corporatation, individual workers, so...

What mean redundant unions though? union area? suck? research involved 100,000 people testing home coronavirus antibodies June 20 July 13.

Given antibodies take several weeks show tests, we're actually looking many infected back May. Along fact significant proportion people disease test negative antibodies, true number probably closer 8-10M. Think it, potentially less 6 feet employee window. doesn‚Äôt really matter are, car, building. within 6 feet someone contact them, potentially putting risk without putting mask. IDK announcements good idea. make many people slack, get infections needed period people actually get vaccinated. Would IMO better talk much it, make talk it.

It seems human nature subject many politicians know much about. four years brother erased enough votes majority black, Dem voting counties swing election. Nothing see there. going start revolution make comments reddit? get doctorate political science? originally started college plans go dentistry school.

It‚Äôs really sad see grocery workers treated like shit. always greet hello good day help Link says page found... read statement German media. agree that. people still given jail time. It‚Äôs hard see smiles masks I‚Äôm trying convey appreciation frontline retail workers. Sorry you‚Äôre going thanks persevering. experienced thing. I‚Äôve retail since 2006. think it‚Äôs they‚Äôre bitter probably can‚Äôt retire, nothing suffering look forward to, nobody blame themselves. never blame themselves, force see inconvenience intentional attack. Close schools!!! happening August November like?? Poverty I'm make sure sincerely thank grocery store employees help me. know important people life right now. live Oklahoma two teenage employees McDonald's shot woman got pissy enforcing masks. world economy collapses completely, nothing value. mean...I believe (kinda) Earth 50% reporting ‚Äúlong term effects‚Äù hasn‚Äôt even around may would consider ‚Äúlong term‚Äù? source this? Wow 40% positivity amazing, I've never seen anybody get high. countries got blamed sued pandemic one. literally governments loud clear know overpopulation thing, quick way get down. literally telling people hey listen, y‚Äôall need die using current stats death figures including estimates via excess mortality? Eh shut moron. worth addressing, aside telling shut up. Lom assuming cared grandma Nothing wrote supports thesis statement. Minorities, elderly, poor people people too.

The type person reading statement would persuasive legitimate argument discounting death rate person reading young, wealthy healthy narcissistic. think purely educational, also structural cultural.. know federalism leads delay variations decision making case pandemy everything want have. hating you, exactly anecdotal evidence reliable. considered real possibility coincidence? day got flu shot, also came symptoms something exposed (could even time beforehand...).

I'm doubting story...but correlation necessarily causation. ideal situation, lockdowns measures could implemented considering epidemologic situation. nit case, think many countries afford second hard lockdown year without risking economical meltdown. bright side, hopefully assholes die soon. republican party trying continue aid giving protective immunity employers protect lawsuits customers &amp; employees.

The democratic party trying offer generous aid platform recoup costs.

Give Senate fixed spending amount let come conclusions based that. 41 new cases today. lot 17 cases day used have. nice single digit numbers July.

The filtered masked still let virus in, effect much use Canada belongs First Nations wife's family Pune, bad there. guys remember someone could work grocery store, able go college buy house? I'm sure understand drop bucket metaphor think 1000 drop 1485.

&amp;#x200B;

This number, pointed person downvoted supporting hysteria, closer drop bucket average daily deaths causes. sucks sure. Probably 100-200 deaths people full lives look forward to. becoming clearer collect data already way out, think need level constant fearmongering sub promotes. .38 special still alive kickin? one took opinion seriously either (besides idiot compared Covid flu/a cold) Hah won‚Äôt lose sleep shitty takes. died somebody else could make money selling plastic pipe. yes.

I bought 4 half face masks recently family members filters. see regular masks stores time. 

They reasonably priced. bought set regular msks keep little pack glove box short outings.

Basically, issue aquiring masks. shortage. simply hospitals refusing supply employees.  Great 1 300 chance death.

That's what's spun 'nothing worry about' Money talks.

Currently UK, one hand we've got Boris promoting anti-obesity drive time he's offering 50% McDonald's junk food outlets month August get people spending again. Oh. OK. Lied it? Nah. Epoch Times fake news. finger pointing it‚Äôs totally justified? Wtf else point to? People go supermarket accidentally contract virus? Please. steps already laid out. Unfortunately made political steps never taken. Elections matter. Honesty matters. Science matters.  excess deaths aren‚Äôt problem remain and, end, best measure happened. Changing method counting brings England line Scotland, Northern Ireland wales make sense. point method counting flawed agree home nations counting flawed way better counting different flawed ways. Americans even care fellow man, makes think they'd care animal? exact stuff goes lighter. elevator button. 

It's good desanitize hands super market reasons. Reddit posters justify saying ""well, harder replace, that's ok treat like dirt"" see anything wrong produce worker local grocery store, confirm, don‚Äôt even keep 6ft I‚Äôm filling something, barge right beside act like sorry put box walk away done Yeah never even heard ICU delerium dad almost month. 

When taken ventilator really good day gone mentally. know end day started getting violent towards nursing staff. 

Because poor lungs sedated without ventilator put back on. Unfortunately happened 2nd time make it. Dec-Jan pre-covid horrible experience all. nurse talked said pretty common unfortunate side effect ICU especially vent. said sees quite often. to. name Flojitsu.

 practic(ed) started. know people saying they're reacting. There's need perpetuate that. apologize response heavy handed. 

The whole thing triggers me. stay safe. Always thought places people gather together indoors, hours socialising, might virus spreads.

Who'd thought it. worker contract illness work? You‚Äôre joking right? Research shows average voter preferences zero effect policy. Americans aren‚Äôt choosing policies that‚Äôs don‚Äôt even bother voting. Obviously get flu shot don‚Äôt panic, good news there‚Äôs one silver lining pandemic, may years‚Äô flu season could much less devastating year‚Äôs past. Early signs Southern Hemisphere encouraging approach end winter. Due COVID-19 preventative measures like mask-wearing social distancing, countries Argentina, South Africa New Zealand seen unexpected drop influenza seasonal respiratory viral infections May June... Australia 85 confirmed influenza cases last two weeks June, compared 22,047 two weeks 2019. country total 132,424 cases last year, year saw 20,739 cases January June, newspaper reported.‚Äù  Like commander chief said.

It is. answer headline: wish dogs cats would start wearing masks social distancing would stop dropping dead place, walk outside see millions dead cats dogs dead result horrible deadly virus. contagious kind though. people going get food underpaid food stockers go strike form picket lines? Internet? They're striking deliveries (they get paid much either.)

The retail/service industry workers cards, they're scared play them. What's even sad paid workers 2 3 checks $300 added onto payroll, grocery stores (I work another huge chain rules south starts ""P"" who's logo green. ""raise"" ¬¢50 got couple gift cards, *for* grocery store work at. beyond horrendous. Walmart hires hunger wages well. We've treated far worse entire time, sub reflects that. disgruntled, dehumanizing stories. even allow us wear mask first ""scare customers"" public backlash. take look excess death stats lazy ****. Sorry. know this‚Äôll piss people can‚Äôt trust numbers, can‚Äôt trust nations control media literally killed people wanting anything already exists mean wheelbarrow load paper currency can't even buy wheelbarrow need haul around? Priorities point people tend think IFR inherent property virus across population whole, infer post.

If virus disproportionately infected vulnerable people within certain country, inflate IFR. Game looks super fun.....At least Jarts now? That's good know. expect learn language integrate culture whatever adopted country decide reside in. fair that.

Literally hardest part would convincing wife. already fuck mindset. kids young enough learn new language without much problems. me. loved going grocery shopping miss much. regional grocery chain requires everyone wear masks inside, makes little bit comfortable thought going in, I'm going hold long continue ordering online. Didn‚Äôt Philip Morris once? gave like million dollars lung cancer charity spent 25 million promoting donation? whole point vaccine get get sick. people haven‚Äôt bad flu do. dad hadn‚Äôt flu teens mid 50s. hospitalized really bad flu. gets flu shot now. also real possibility multiple flus years thought cold passed others severe infection.

If get bad flu year bad bad US healthcare system. get mild flu year pass others won‚Äôt bad bad US healthcare system. Don‚Äôt guy. Man protect community. points ¬∑ 19 hours ago  can‚Äôt deny people vaccines based government‚Äôs policies, that‚Äôs basically creating massive global humanitarian crisis get last word.

also, countries act irrationally ones endangering rest world making global humanitarian crisis.

US great job paying much attention virus. grab vaccines bully bloc. happen people undeveloped countries get lot time.

so... yes, told annoyed way exaggerated also yes - countries ""score"" taken consideration determining get much priority. People unable want accept current situation. one loves wearing mask go protocols, something adjust greater good. wager matters lot, go supermarket, wear mask, touch contaminated shopping cart - probably less likely infected bringing contaminated lighter face, inhaling. 

same goes contaminated packaging. wash hands touching package, cook food, practice basic kitchen hygiene(not touching anything goes near cooked food handling raw food, wiping surfaces, etc) probably clear. biggest oops award goes to.... know everything government conspires internet? retract position. Nothing shady happens modern society government fully transparent thanks internet keeping accountable. Loss rights freedom happens small steps condition people choose keep head sand like good boy Bikersgangs always mixed bag run-of-the-mill criminals, trashy folk losers - looking kind status place belong. image always myth reality - going far back early 60s. 

Just bunch low-level criminals lacking coherent uniting vision beyond senseless rebellion in-group dynamics - nothing special really, fetishization media image biker 'outlaw'. bikers ofcourse heavily leaned identified cover justify fragile ego paralyzing levels internalized toxic masculinity. 

I fuck ofcourse, nothing dangerous bunch guys whose ego's propped estimation dangerous people think are. certainly look them.

Now true varying degrees varying gangs ofcourse - held true encounters biker gangs - hells angels especially - real life.  I'm sure bikers listen certain kinds music? grocery store IT, add ill-treatment stop store employees. Even internally within company treat us like dirt. Expendable dirt. store go always use self checkout robot roams store checking item availability there‚Äôs clean ups needed. people aren‚Äôt essential. apparently athletes soldiers now... south. Idiots Thankfully gathering managers, frontline workers. Ofc bad still, better someone directly faces customers.

The franchise requires mask times too. Stay away set LoTR show, plz Every single antibody study given exact range. It‚Äôs time admit IFR closer 1% CDC wrong. Again. Idiots Sorry country treats like trash expects raise children. Good luck stay safe  think they're believing lie? number days around 2,000 new cases per day we've 1,000 week.

Despite recent setbacks, Vietnam, country 96 million land border almost 1000 miles China still kicking Alabama's ass. Along long list whole nations millions tens millions people.

Also triple digit new cases every day, goes something still high community easily go right back again, infectious. look happened Melbourne Australia relaxed slightly wrestle things back control skyrocketing several hundred cases day almost nothing. nutshell US issue

Sweden zero deaths daily count

Belgium 6.

Did two countries per capita data months ago? Yes.

Do care happened past, whats happening right now? However want calculate it, way per capita death rate matching anymore places like that.

Some Americans also think proper compare third world places like Brazil India, Micronations like San Marino.

Its finding calculation comparison country make feel better. help Americans die to. Thats beautiful thing college, skip year decide something else bit, grades/GPA dont go anywhere remain eventually return. Take year everyone. Hell, forgot Hong Kong Asian flus 1950s 1960s, pretty bad. top link daily PDF reports numbers daily situation. bottom link dashboard. Idiots yeah humans day day lives 2122 many people thinking covid 19? guess many Gee, almost like Americans prove biggest stupid morons **in world**

Us get pandemic control (over300 million) IDIOTS. another messed issue deal too, thought less frequent sending kids school sick, still messed issue. God bless everyone involved. Scientists manufacturers distributers. Walmart employee never were. do. see proof percentage serious cases much lower claimed. That's debatable. got somewhere first, mean land modern Canada. However, think Canadians woefully ignorant First Nations culture. mandatory study school. kmow, sarcastic people starting upvoting lol. Oh well, need upvotes sub comment every 8 minutes. That's good know appreciate info. tend expect learn language culture would engage in, including history - know makes usual person compared average American. unwillingness learn, barrier exists.

I happened minor anthropology world history, probably way am. literally try cultural foods, learn language customs. fascinating different cultures be, well similarities. one entirely completely believe China. nothing transparent open entire process....... Another factor would environment. 

I dont know specific prison know ones area give inmates hour day outdoor rec time. Coupled diet thats probably lacking would fair assume lot people vitamin deficient. 

Again may different here, area. 2 cell. cell fairly small, bedroom size. Bunk beds. one inmate shedding virus. getting hammered 23 hours day small room.

We also seen broader public men seem harder time virus.

So we're looking less ideal nutrution, probable lack activity, high viral load.

Then there's likelihood nothing done knocking deaths door.

So we're looking bad get outside nursing home still &lt;1.1% IFR. isolated definitely ugly statistic. think gives weight estimated IFR around 0.67% broader population. said anything bjj? Dude, idea talking about. I'll never care say. Save it.   Yup demoted regular cashier due support management. It‚Äôs crazy you‚Äôre expected solve problems arose due COVID. one replace cause one wants higher position either mean? countries find IT, english office language. times need know something language specific someone clarify you. Especially leader field. trying tell us assholes exist? got bad news you: Christmas every day America. adults obeying rules US, expect kids to...

What reopening schools look like? Tiny coffins... Hundreds thousands them... Lets real. worker essential store.

The grocery store worker thing decade. Sure people working right current grocery store worker phased out.

So convince essential wrong. say evil, bother. can't good conscience go vote lesser two evils. thats make gov't less evil. US needs external enemy otherwise lapses civil war due fact it‚Äôs melting pot people cultures inequality LOT entitlement.

All don‚Äôt make middle class rich accountable errors unless it‚Äôs doxxing racism social media presume physical barriers like nasal hairs etc also play part, that's definitely lacking cell culture. idea popular view Reddit, it‚Äôs reprehensible opinion. people low IQ, people receive extremely poor education. It‚Äôs difficult overcome either these. celebrating deaths people made poor decisions due circumstances quite possibly control. many wonderful kind people world aren‚Äôt particularly clever. It‚Äôs funny Reddit ‚Äòchecking privilege‚Äô, it‚Äôs ideologically convenient so. intelligence education biggest possible privilege life. Would worth shot me, extreme circumstances call extreme measures. least would try getting cheap gun, shooting birds enter backyard airspace, eating selling meat, straight flip drugs that‚Äôs takes stay afloat. wouldn‚Äôt like, well I‚Äôm fucked job, nothing do, might well starve die Flu season isn‚Äôt influenza. respiratory viruses spread better too, including coronaviruses. concern Rt SARS-CoV-2 increase, making current measures insufficient, leading large increase cases. 
We're trapped prison two choices presently, I've advocating alternative approach:
 
* Students grades 6 - 12 begin school year fully remote
* Students grades K - 5 begin school year fully school
* K - 5 students utilize vacant classrooms higher grade levels would occupied order reduce density
* Hire large number younger, healthier Teachers' Assistants - focus recently graduated unemployed
* teachers fall categories associated negative COVID-19 outcomes, assign one multiple TAs classroom teacher teaches remotely
* Evaluate specific regional circumstances monthly basis adapt accordingly
 
If teachers still want teach, desire push ideological narratives condition willingness teach, teachers. missed start briefing today, may add notes later on:

* 567 total places ICU country, 361 taken places 33 patients COVID-19.

From yesterday statistics:

* numbers last weeks performed tests released. week 32 
53721 PCR tests performed 2017 new confirmed infected, brings positivity ratio 3.75% - slightly higher previous weeks still around 3% month. ( data : link post title )
* recent update compare [FHM deaths [Socialstyrelsen deaths [Statistics Sweden preliminary statistics period 1/3 2/8 (leaving last 10 days may incomplete still). period SCB found **4834 excess deaths** based causes compared period 2015-2019 (*note current reported deaths within baseline previous years since start July, excess deaths accumulated earlier periods diminishing*). period Socialstyrelsen found **5584 deaths COVID-19** based death certificates (*note 90% also individuals tested COVID-19, present FHM statistics*). period FHM found **5764 deaths COVID-19** based counting deaths people confirmed COVID-19 within 30 days death (*note 5 reported deaths without date confirmed end period also included number*).

US made damn term 'first world'

""The term First World refers developed, capitalist, industrial countries, generally aligned NATO USA"" That's really great obviously appreciated. 

As retail worker, though, would settle people wearing fucking masks correctly (assuming they're wearing one begin with). I'm showing work abiding safety measures 8-10 hours day. least someone could show respect tough mask twenty minutes. stock great, still get treated like shit customers management terrible. much happier left. Thank you, internet stranger. skinny get vaccine put bunch weight after? Nobody could anything it?



Please.


If trump actually keep quiet let experts work would even better option..

Instead first downplayed virus calling democratic hoax.
Then politicized pandemic made simple precautionary measures sound like democrats trying snatch freedom.


That's leader country react pandemic.


And this.


His pettiness killing Americans Healthcare workers sacrificing much taking care covid cases often result Trump's actions. try fun can, customers rude rude right back basically tell fuck comes it. get angry storm managers office, happy I'm work give flying fuck complaint. is. /s information world accessible local library free form books internet beg differ. well, really liking liking - matter endangering world around allowing virus thrive.

You're Reddit get used it. I'm sure professors would love sourcing data reddit lol Yeah probably cancel it

Seriously, focused worst possible part everything? hell Quick, somebody give plant owner immunity! can't responsible actions killing wage slaves! No, want know efforts made research accommodations. Yes, masks accommodation one kind, way cancel possibility accommodation. hunch...that exist humans...you know, clever enough come way permit one person 50 plane safely fly without mask. People discussion quick flippantly say ""well bad"". 

Just know, every turn disabled people spoken asked accommodations, they've told ""you want special treatment"". ""enough sob story"".

It's wrecking survivors, working economy workforce disabled? 

Someone floated idea reddit planes designated infected think real possibility could eventually evolve quarantine zones within major cities, separate infected uninfected allow life thus economy continue, expect martial-law lite. colleges universities put anything admissions standards? would probably help relieve stress high school students parents something worked out, least public colleges.

Exactly, customers treating grocery employees like crap. Corporate using pandemic exploit workers tenfold. probably do. We're catching it. Honestly - America never really chance containment.

February was. Dozens airports US receiving international flights daily. Cross-border traffic across literally thousands miles land borders Canada Mexico. Extensive intrastate travel daily basis.

Containment virtually impossible environment. Say starts 3 cases course 5 days: 1 case arriving Seattle, 1 case arriving North Dakota/Manitoba border, 1 case arriving JFK airport. That's 3, would quickly becomes 10 100 spread across multiple states. off.

Nevermind state 62,000 cases 5 million total population, hopefully never reach eventually rate. mention fact want Covid19 reach anyone know, that's good thing. aunt, wife hand taken exact opposite way feel bad probably contributed freaking it. 60 years old though. would like people aware real.

Thats probably realistic timeline America 100% guaranteed orange bastard announce rushed vaccine days election someone roadtrip several Midwest states, best tip use bathroom chain grocery stores can.

' Hey Shu, go get covid test kit...'

'Why?'

'Just get it, want test chicken'

'What?' Cases 37% month month , hospitalizations 7% week week. Texas Arizona also dropping. hard time believing people states banded together socially distance wear masks everywhere go know else explain it.

I know what's actually open FL right many folks taking precautions. 3 weeks ago antibodies 16% FL, granted selection bias probably charts still, go on. October know herd immunity real schools opening across country. Haha know right. What's always entertaining every time states numbers drop, they're lying numbers. numbers go they're telling truth.  Fucking hell. Idaho Florida Pacific Northwest. two dogs months ago &amp; (when tested lab). thought multiple tests &amp; confirmed might misremembering. One dead old. 

My guess it‚Äôs surprise randomly people seem ignore things happens US. 

Plus seem rare idk many dogs testing.

This heartbreaking. pretty close sun city- actual retirement community. Cheaper put sign increase pay, provide healthcare, provide PPE, provide better enforcement procedures protect workers, etc.

And since sign put up, power *rationalize* acknowledging workers courage sacrifices, improving morale etc. Remember (Robert A. Man rational animal, rationalizing animal.

Sorry, locking there's lot arguing devolving hate speech. nextdoor Facebook page need look at.

Man, usa people dumb makes demented monkeys half brain look like freaking scientists.  work retail. Every shift go mentally prepare get screamed at, argued with, receive snide comments. happens every day far worse pre-COVID. Since employer reopened I've found struggling sleep, hardly ever appetite food, I've lost weight, get dizzy work randomly, blood pressure consistently high I'm 24. Pretty close picking smoking cigarettes again.

If upside suppose mutual hatred jobs lead coworkers develop strong bond lately we've partying together hanging out, drinking getting fucked forget, hours, next shift store. smart us pandemic? Probably not. situation hopelessly spiraled control US anyway. worst job first job grocery store cashier....never think masks good, used properly, there's need lockdown. guess never really thought it, safety guidelines already exclude tons people, without exemption, like said.  non-covid world mother may found later son would types meltdowns, would another day.

8391 Folsom Blvd, Sacramento, CA 95826 literally could stand keep working going hiatus job couple months this. grocery worker, work craft store deemed essential sell masks mask making supplies. 

I keep seeing terrible people coworkers thinking something going break soon. workforce made stand take abuse we're jobs. fear goddamn lives we're asking old men cover drippy-ass noses. 

I genuinely scared going get hit shot said anything anybody masks keeping hands clean. I've never seen many customers leave bathroom without washing hands, never handed much cash, lot visibly dirtied. 

I got manager sicced ""calling customer fat"" day. middle aged woman picked little kid sized mask told fit her, because, know, *they're sized literal children grown ass adults.*

God. got away me, vent. I'm glad I'm going back anytime soon. remember headline Feb. dailymail, typical level sourcing. Actually, iirc story ppl killing cats dogs govt said could spread. think op may mixed stories up, since govt kill several hundred million pigs last year due swine flu outbreaks. Also, first dog verified positive belonged woman Hong Kong back January. tax? Cause baggers make like $8 $9 hour. Even minimum wage $7.25. quarantine two weeks, would well worth it. go often go home depot pick dry wall anchors order online. freaking terrifying... like way many people.. people bringing whole family (kids babies), contractors haphazardly wearing masks shopping colleagues. never advocated patriarchy anywhere comments. anything displaying benevolent sexism whole ""matriachial primates less violent"" premise there's evidence that. hundreds species primates, come conclusion matriarchal species less violent? measure violence species something? I‚Äôm grocery worker/cart pusher, kinda disagree care because? Rectal thermometers. /s Jesus, infection stay around? husband stopped buying frozen food time back concerns. Might seem extreme, virus loves coronasicles. time consuming hell decontaminate packaging, us, whole kitchen every time. I'm worried restaurant grocery workers touch stuff. Old school smiley, circa mid late 1990s. Excellent specimen, indeed. 

Also Gen Xer here. Millennials Gen Z pick copy ‚ÄùMicroserfs‚Äù Douglas Coupland well, especially working tech industry. Virus burns around 20% people infected. Great news.

Also, open schools, kids died double rate flu year COVID. means need states it. They'll also always people want leave homes families loved ones even higher paying job would benefit. Losing ""experienced"" superintendents treated teachers like shit inflating pay acceptable loss means bring new people primarily motivated maximizing wealth. American public favor war 9/11 happened people afraid, angry, wanted revenge happened. Can't really blame them. took years people realize war giant mistake sloppy mess. Trump stop letting CDC report new infection numbers sent White House instead? I‚Äôd bet less 1 100. above, below. God. Walmart worker, guy yesterday kept asking would happen wear mask. Yep return new copperfit mask  Seeing what‚Äôs going New Zealand makes wonder whether ever could realistically contained America. 

The US certainly made worse taking action early on, seems inevitable spreads given highly contagious nature virus. worked Kroger 7 years. never treated us like humans. NZ Citizens residents allowed country quarantined govt facilities (hotels) 2 weeks tested twice release, requirement another 2 weeks self-isolation that. That's interesting response. updating comment last minutes (as continue investigate), suddenly find highly unscientific, uncivil response. Reporting. ‚ÄúTrump bad say good.‚Äù Canadian also Greek parents. asked elderly father coping COVID isolating home. told remembers nazi tanks rolled little village Greece fell ensuing years nothing compared that. Also r/nottheonion That's poster meant. meant delved categorizing horrible people sub-human, that's pathway fascism. call people horrible without painting sub-human. Owning there's thin line people decent people guard fascism. Part deep bury head ground strategy generally sweeping US mad Trump ""LiTeRaLlY hItLeR"", also mad federal government go around forcing people homes?


You know, like China did? Trump symptom. gets booted out, even ends prison somehow, still needs remembered something like third country hoping someone like return. guess brain got smart, head got dumb. (Wow, there's lot material song...) Imagine working Commissary United States government provide masks hardly safety procedures workers... *oh wait do* everybody access N95 masks, bourgeoisie, allowed protect others cannot protect well. must collectivize risk catching coronavirus everybody wear surgical cloth masks. Wuhan released 70 + days lockdown, still able find cases infections there. paying then, ya plague leech?

One first things learned school public health safety part raison d'etre government. Murica hung Multilayered piece cloth exhale port effect. Yeah, expect bunch cases deaths, becomes normal, like mass shootings become. Yeah, guess takeaway study depends goal. want protect yourself, stay away people wearing bad masks. dont need change mask material care people. Can‚Äôt imagine stringent response sustainable Rumors fall greatly exaggerated. I‚Äôm scared click that...  quite, work printing shop. People send us photos phone print things. don‚Äôt want touch another person‚Äôs phone email stuff pretty obvious reasons, hate annoyance shit obvious people tell annoyed even though I‚Äôm wearing mask. chance make sure never office first place good people Florida elected dumbass anyways. Many us wouldn‚Äôt around citizens leadership behaved like spanish flu. relatives wouldn‚Äôt made make us even possible. Oof idea long spreading. might lucky caught early, need search clusters. Wait treated us like humans ever? lol oh boy. sub murderous occupants. bet you‚Äôre empathetic one huh? ""NUMBER ONE NUMBER ONE NUMBER ONE!"" challenge virus traverses party lines, doesnt care belongs ideology

There rumors Loie Gohmert republican, one claimed mask gave covid, one called staff together room without anyone wearing mask, announce positive, may given another congress person opposite affiliation, mask wearer . Gohmert wore mask chin even grocery stores, anything retail treated like garbage. Arent vaccines less effective obese people? Sales sales. It‚Äôs always tough compare sales private sector jobs. Maybe anecdotally know 2 teachers crushed sales. But, that‚Äôs anecdotal. 
You make good points though. don‚Äôt think negates points either. exactly right. There's saying (often inaccurately attributed Stalin) death man tragedy, death million statistic. good refute.

Only universe everything cause. can't however, place God bounds universe God created universe, and, matter fact, God created ""cause"" first place. 

God restricted bounds universe live in. grandma learned basics iPhone 75. stubborn hell learn this.

CEO. POTUS. wife exposed today person work exposed person B (suspected COVID symptoms). Person B tested awaiting results 72 hours so.

What do? wife quarantine? straight hairy ass holes comment section, hope y‚Äôall catch covid severe diarrhea symptoms.üñï fed already printed $4 trillion mostly help keep corporations stocks up, youre concerned printing money pay regular workers? typical wait till kids start killing mom dad, stupid leaders get paid 200,000$ year more. Fucking stupid. We‚Äôre beyond weeds. Welcome jungle, baby. I'd say we've got president deserve moment, though president need... Haha ELSE government's job?? asked individual could choose person president, think answers would ever include nominee ballots last half century?

there's significant difference ""who want"" ""who voted for."" Newer England? city exist. monument man's arrogance! No, subsided used 6 weeks annual leave. mention Patriot Act. GOP wants make starve unless go job, legal immunity put dangerous situation. 

Don't vote party. Unionize, unionize, unionize True. Oh yea. even time wearing mask alarmist. FREEDUMMMMMMMMMB! virus way awful. don‚Äôt want anything like again. said ‚Äúlung infection‚Äù bronchitis. wanted go hospital twice. went urgent care got breathing treatments. Later, daughter saw symptoms news said, ‚Äúmommy, that‚Äôs had.‚Äù 
And, husband kept talking strange cold fever lasted long. Ive never sick. plenty information enable people make sensible choices. People ignore information wilfully pretty much impossible change mind. emotional, rational, choice part. think, however, societal factors lead point need addressed. long thing? Thanks! solve anything. ""Printed money"" gets paid back next years form inflation, interest rates, weakening U.S. treasury bonds public.

Try again? I'm curious implementation. states can't, won't, chip $100 would people state still receive $300? one predicated other? everything go process.  Clearly takes advice doesn‚Äôt trust experts hair... know lol. carry like football follow-up appointment ENT asked ""can look inside nose?"" son slapped hands nose shouted no. Thankfully anything else we'll see future trips go.. Havin hard time picturing one using rampant voter suppression evidence elections *aren't* rigged? time alarmist? mention ""wings"" made spectrum point fingers with. jokes assuming I'm American.

Now know American, I'm sure there's plenty intelligent people country, past 5 years proven population sub par education, assume things, I'm going assume part idiocracy. know lesser knowledge need fight voice even though wrong. American Way!!! don‚Äôt link you, pricing quantity sent spread sheet. said, n95 disposables available sporadically since mid May p100 respirator cartridges almost always stock. Whoever work probably already knows can‚Äôt afford keep supplied none get it. bring own? SARS Covid act virtually same. don‚Äôt give fuck Coronavirus 3 causes common cold 50,000 years ago, it‚Äôs immunity likely absolutely bearing modern equivalent.

The SARS structured Coronaviruses, structured different common cold variants, ridiculously long immunity. Covid, like SARS Coronaviruses, act like SARS.

And generic coronavirus 1 acted like SARS 2000 years ago whenever, probably SARS length immunity, ancestors would‚Äôve died also ignores still puts teachers risk putting old facilities bathrooms usually lack soap hot water around colleagues refuse wear masks social distance. also ignores happens teachers‚Äô kids. one week time period people LITERALLY treating us like veterans saying ‚Äúthank service‚Äù 
And next week back FUCK LYSOL TOILET PAPER SAW EMPLOYEE BUYING SINGLE ROLL FAIR CAUSE NON ESSENTIAL WORKERS GET WIPE ASS Exactly. can't prove thing. Alabama may live, regard home; like bum-fucking Egypt ""Roll Tide!"". Mostly men, yes. confirm, worked grocery store kid. day single worst job I've ever had. Ive literally shoveled horse shit heat far better job that, deal entitled idiots payed better. I'm avid hiker using gaiters feel disappointment. bought today convenient gaiter, good quality better options I've come across. Also little pricey($22). Luckily live shop able avoid shipping cost. Used code ""welcome"" 5% I'm like 80% sure ""MMS""/bleach started someone trolling anti-vaxxers, telling ""they"" try every way prevent truth getting out, like...ate up. Great comment, appreciate you! Monday Tuesday school closed deep cleaning nine tests confirmed positive. Wednesday number tripled.

As safety measure, Paulding County School District Superintendent Dr. Brian Otott Principal Gabe Carmona announced Wednesday students would adhere hybrid learning environment.¬† really news, it? France Effizinc suggested April doctors boost effectivity hydroxychloroquine. bring lot results. Disagree

It started 2002 2003 idea whether lead less. people hide cases it. People dont like separated everything care countries solitary confinement considered inhumane degree. ""Bring dead!"" 

**clang**

""Bring dead!"" Despite coronavirus pandemic, thousands bikers poured small city Sturgis Friday start annual motorcycle rally. [250,000 people expected attend 10-day making one largest events take place pandemic. lord giveth, lord taketh away. anybody gets sick dies, tearfully question god‚Äôs rather question ignoring obvious warnings. 

I know praying everyday end covid, gives? Maybe need pray harder neither. Even vaccine, they'd playing lockdown yo-yo game decades come. United States America built it. whatever ""Murica"" is. would good place start. sure read ""Important Notice"" link well. may want convince friend stay home Tokyo. seems hassle return back Japan worth headache stress. running around vacation spots rather trying get touch immigration services. even acting like ""illegal"" immigrants hiding fear caught. going straight tourist destinations running around good time, spreading disease equipment 

Ah, anti-masker, I'll take slow you. fight mean attenders, clashed them.

Though I'm sure critical thinking one defining traits. As¬†schools¬†nationwide struggle finalize reopening plans, abruptly changed course of¬†coronavirus¬†outbreaks pushback community. One school district New Jersey voted week hold classes remotely, despite Governor Phil Murphy insisting months form in-person classes. Looking charts, looks things going get worse South. 

Doesn't matter whether ""REAL"" number Covid deaths 100k 200K me. dropped ball either way, that's past. matters take steps prevent future deaths. heralding heroes start, they're ignored, abused, and/or underappreciated.

       
They‚Äôll celebrated again.   
Once professional sporting events fully attended, honored ‚Äúthe heroes game‚Äù right national anthem... games early season anyways.    
We‚Äôll clap cheer feel good honoring them. we‚Äôll go get hotdog beer watch game.  best hotdog beer day. Well sucks amazing long Romans lasted.... yes consider Byzantines Romans

Also think USA currently like UK 1920s? think so.

UK back beginning terminal decline Empire, know chance getting it, depending fast case detected. almost certainly going get stay home 2 weeks. Lol @ audacity idea Didnt Australia people breaking forced quarantines? know 100s cases people breaking quarantines Africa. tomorrow someone told locked month single room (in 5 star hotel) youd cool it? committed crime? self-styled ‚Äúarchbishop‚Äù purported church Florida sells industrial bleach ‚Äúmiracle cure‚Äù Covid-19 arrested son Colombia faces extradition US. product sheer stupidity, neglect mismanagement intentional. rich millionaires run America effectively hole castle-mansions years, make money moving stocks, dodge pandemic average Americans get evicted, lose jobs, lose lives.

This crime humanity country world (China, Iran, North Korea etc.) Americans would furiously pointing finger.

Get angry. Abscess?

Because *those* don‚Äôt want fuck with. Especially months. 

Glad able fix whatever was!! mentality we're leading world deaths we'll never able reopen. thought masks bad, wait military checkpoints curfews, that's Karens leading us. beginning thought like common pneumonia everyone went ventilators china. know tiny blood vessels everywhere clotting up. virus attacks organs lungs seem first infection starts, breathe virus in. work lowe's Florida. covid constantly clean self- check every use. can't use regular register thats military discount check machines decided hiccup. amount dirty looks backhanded comments get customers can't help would make person want kill themselves. I've already reported couple customers ( one including coworker break ) bad employee aiding properly. added fact people comprehend use machines. There're signs right screen state whether takes , card cash card. penny every time someone asked machine takes cash would probably $50. surprise low moral grocery store, actually surprised moral. kind you. 

When young, held various customer service jobs delivering office supplies, cashiering, caddying, working restaurants. day, appreciate service workers, I‚Äôve there. thankless exhausting. know this, wish rest America did... wrote fake news. People country fucking dumb. I‚Äôm ready leave served country. I‚Äôm gonna bet COVID capability hang around people latently. nothing go of, y‚Äôall locked COVID extinguished, think needs looked into. it‚Äôs found another species act reservoir. We‚Äôre always learning new things, maybe two weeks isn‚Äôt enough people. article mentions Elizabeth‚Äôs school district uses Paulding example do. Bleach enema new craze. Kills 'rona viruses colon whitens bung time. Can't go wrong. Seems forgot /s think appropriate term ‚Äúsnowflakes.‚Äù remember quit part-time job supermarket late feb remember extended family calling South Korea every week telling parents COVID already becoming endemic country family, remember bad SARS was.

and remember concerned enough told supervisor would quit weren‚Äôt enough protections workers fend possibility shopping COVID. quit supervisor told would never become serious thing here. last years, data science seems conquered podium best jobs pursuit reason. (virtually) infinite amount data available made data science affable field study even non-experts. Obviously, data science needs data, even amount data available enormous, data useful least usable. America much patience left. realistically vaccine early next year (spring latest) we'll letting rip. I'm hoping lose another 30lbs then. Stop judging people, get nowhere life.

I nothing say anyone who's main purpose insult humiliate me, would waste time. showed willing talk, complete dick, would different. I'm blocking you.

I hope nice day stay safe. Which, turn, inspired Japanese Folk Tale name. outbreak parallels beijing cluster June imported frozen salmon. Thats stupid. nobody takes virus serious ppl overreact. Really come he‚Äôs obviously infectious. scientists becoming like bible thumpers claim everything sin. I'm talking 3M 6000 series half facemask respirator common one find home depot hardware store. They're everywhere. exhalation valve front attach filters either side.

Edit: think might missed point, simply saying ""respirators ok flying"" good policy. Many readily available respirators valves. understand ones *you* use work not. common. $35 hour? almost spit drink. I‚Äôm ICU nurse covid unit almost 10 years experience don‚Äôt make much. way hell going pay poor souls treated like shit grocery store kind money.

Prayers best wishes you, one essential another. promise never rude all, always tip well. appreciate do. personally could never imagine shouting rude supermarket staff can't imagine situation could incite kind anger I'm sure many feel way.

What people's heads think act way do? really get it. 1500 people died Titanic we're still talking 100 years later. 1500 people dying PER DAY like nobody even bats eye.  Sorry, Murica built it. Internment camp, nice dramatic flair. temporary, get it. thinking state facilitated mandatory quarantine? probably make people hide infection.. choice though. Offer options. imprisoning someone committed crime issue. creating internment camp punishing sick leads people avoid testing. America way I'd tested unless I'm hospitalized. encourages people lie protect becoming pariah. Man, that's one dope protection suit! went month ago filling fell out. feel like gone place emergency work little casual it. It‚Äôs long enough I‚Äôm confident came alright, guess includes FFP3 masks? would make sense @Walmart_towells 

Never realized retail selling shoes requires flame retardant clothing.

Selling shoes job friend proudly showed gaiter does.

But, tell me, await breathless anticipation explanation retail shoe salesmen wear flame retardant clothing. That's really disappointing would this. lethargy took 1.5 weeks go away, breathing pain took 3 weeks 2.5 months get rid gnarly cough.

I never hospitalized, definition, mild case. Exercise lot breathing exercises. No, they're actually passing blame pretending problem time. BC Canada! Sounds like head doctor modeling response yours. I'd expect stores schools start striking walking thing economy literally cannot afford to, jobs obligation continue working (retail, restaurant, delivery, etc financially obligated; doctors, nurses, teachers ethically obligated) real choice income comes from. need work one way another, can't *stop working demand treated better.* They'll criticized lose job. Exactly, came chance infect them. major issue/safety concern years ago. knew union rep. called union rep. sat HR union rep. Nothing addressed. Never again.

A coworker got fired bullshit store fought unemployment. call. woman unemployment side rep. what's proposal think lead less infection death quarantine hotels? system broken. broken. broken.

Your first statement correct. last two aren't.

We broken, tired beaten down, yet broken.

If there's world leader died demonstrate realness severity pandemic, Bolsonaro. live country (Netherlands) believe masks. People longer socially distance. Hardly anyone wears mask.

I wear mask valve it. I'm less likely carrier. wore surgical mask outside till fellow countrymen women wake use mask benefit society.

They wear mask wear additional mask them?

In fact, I'll happily stop wearing N95 switch surgical start wearing masks. reason need N95 instead surgical vast majority population refuses wear mask socially distance. talking permanent quarantine. grocery store worker, confirm. Job even soul sucking think quote I‚Äôm gonna use faced next Karen- thanks. this? Essential workers getting screwed hilarious, never seen bot before

""Corona ü§¢ nicer ü§ó""

lmao first positive case accidentally discovered mass-testing environmental samples Beijing wholesale market outbreak. 

No, Beijing's outbreak first case old man started show symptoms went get treatment. photographic memory questioned he's past 14 days, one item recalled went Xinfadi buy fish he's grandson said would like eat fish. able recall exactly shop market got fish exactly time there, immediately raised alarm set ball running. He's memory good able give exact list 38 people interacted 14 days confirmed positive.

He's nickname Chinese ÂüéË•øÂ§ßÁà∑. Thanks amazing memory suspected source found quickly. Here's since one probably local contamination (later testing showed batch shrimp negative entering market)

The fish shop old man's recollection found contaminated, particularly cutting board use chop fish particular sample collected inside mouth salmon shop positive. salmon imported Norway. outbreak Beijing D614G mutation never encountered China point. Gene sequencing pointed European origin strand, although ancient D614G mutation equipped strain circulating Europe time.

So nothing definitive, strongly point could imported frozen food. see anywhere article Russia forces countries get vaccine convinced effectiveness (based individual separated tests done outside Russia)! Seems like solid 67% country thinks way. No, mostly sounds stupid. makes sense think American solves problems causes, point makes snicker cause funny. rest world would much easier time standing America spent last century insisting allowed forcing us disgusting empire. think Russia would threat today sabatouged thing close free election almost back 90s. America completely incompetent evil Putin would still kissing countries ass. leaders fuckwits turn everything touch shit, is. Give choice, move quarantine leave country infect someone else. choose latter government buy property market value, via con dios. mean, could take far: ""Before reopening, require zero active cases Covid, flu, tuberculosis, half dozen diseases. Also, cars banned now.""

However, US one last countries I'd expect go road. Monday Tuesday school closed deep cleaning nine tests confirmed positive. Wednesday number tripled

None related relationship itself... still affected it. took us realize that, treated one another kind poorly it. definitely said things regret, make long run. Dated briefly realized months ago evolved two different people forcing relationship wasn‚Äôt anymore. love respect never faded, even romantic interest did, we‚Äôre still pretty close nice. 

I figure fuck sometimes- usually knew fucked right away always try apologize. temper getting better bad lapse judgement don‚Äôt ever want define am. explosive temper growing up, worked really hard take control it. control nearly decade hardcore PTSD forced again, even momentarily, still really regret that. don‚Äôt ever want reason someone love cries. I‚Äôm incredibly grateful I‚Äôm still close ex, able move past that... still regret things ended.

I‚Äôm much actively aware emotions, date someone new, hope respect love need... also honest needs, think real issue.

Bit tangent, bad, I‚Äôm bringing seem looking upon yourself, unfairly. None us perfect. fuck sometimes hurts others. apologize move forward. Right wrongs can. sound like super empathetic person really cares others. Fuck ups momentary blips lives, don‚Äôt let define you.

Unless living somehow completely grid able hunt grow food build shelter, economic collapse affect ruin life, leading starvation homelessness. Refusing wear mask protect oneself others exercising freedom? That's completely moronic idiotic.

Moreover, refusing wear mask, anti-science idiots already politicized pandemic way. Take sake argument. true, would consider foolish? were, I'll concede that, apologies. question severity vs transmissibility various blood types etc? senseless, terrible advice. GO REGULAR CHECKUPS, PEOPLE. R K E amazed someone wrote entire article indicating approach flawed, deadly, failed. Common sense would said that's going happen. mentality perpetuates problem....

My Mom broke hip. return home could sit upright, parents got stranded Texas recovery. Again, can't follow rules, can't fly. rules say need sitting fully upright take landing even First Class Seats. No, use bacteria yeast factory produce antibodies, put antibodies inhaler.

Also, epoxy floor meat cutting room peeling meat chunks would dissapear underneath. happy particular store closed. one new employee orientation chose part union, offered job protection portion paycheck. really pushy well.

I grew wild child help build log cabin woods, learned forage &amp; trap, learned basic survival skills wild. spent huge chunk childhood practicing skills. knowledge along extremely rusty muscle memory would *very* hard pressed make choice go woods provide myself. (Well, I‚Äôm badly disabled now, I‚Äôd fucked ten ways Sunday let‚Äôs pretend I‚Äôm not.) *know* capable personal experience. 

Take average urban human that‚Äôs never done watch Survivor, wouldn‚Äôt know first thing. Add various chronic illnesses many people carry ability survive wild drops precipitously.

Convincing friends family neighbours coworkers caring stuff even uncomfortable takes fight future. incredibly sad sentence would downvoted. People fucking disgusting appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* studies doctor reference?

We dealing novel corona virus exist 20 months ago. kept latest science research? so, research studies referencing? Sharing would oput discussion rest real quick, provide world better info effective.

So please share sources doctor used make determination type PPE sources tend say good enough, good you‚Äôre still answering questions? different oh knowledgeable one? want bloodwork? platelets 181 doctor says it‚Äôs safe LP maybe tell wait see thoughts are?

Why would waste time trying change subject? aviation safety inspector industrial hygienist. PPE performance sorts threats CBR spectrum world. would comment something would need oncologist comment on?

You would need changing subject trying discredit really believed shared study doctor referencing told gaiters acceptable.

So study referencing via doctor? peak 10% got virus died NYC. gotten Covid yet gotten flu, years ago felt like going die worst ever felt.

The flu plus covid (regardless stronger not) destroy body. mention places schools open seen numbers children skyrocket.

If get shit together millions die like last time major pandemic hit US acted fucking way. Buddy, fact trying apply personal experience entire country hilarious. Tell us: downtown Baltimore rural Kansas? Meanwhile South Africa, banned outright since end March. I'd say 50 million deaths 2 years pretty good indicator worse. Considering even million 8 months global population MUCH larger. 

Let's also ignore flu killed kids otherwise healthy young adults, covid seems much worse effects older people. state obvious, 97% effective *not* mean every interaction carries 3% risk. Ok, right? cautious person people know. I'm still staying home except essentials doctors appointments. I'm turning playdates. kids socialized since early march. wear mask go out. grocery pick up. yet, sub still manages make feel like I'm enough. wild ride, really. even yet start. Hoping best. Silence would great, actually. Honestly I‚Äôve experienced far positive things cannabis alcohol. 3% testing people symptoms, fyi.

Australia, China, NZ countries allow asymptomatic testing, positive rate goes dramatically 0.X%. Ugga thugga hand egg bad ugga thugga god real also. Although, hear UK seems coming back bit. Christ y‚Äôall harsh removed reality. Completely understandable people severely depressed isolation want see loved ones small gatherings. 

Seems like lot people weird enjoyment condemning anyone desire social talks loved ones. office buildings live also un-openable windows. Nice work. Hope keep avoiding junk pandemic got new healthy habit life.

I losing weight since started counting calories new year's resolution, got laid quarantined two at-risk people (meaning essentially going nowhere every day I've got lot time hands), started little chart track new weight lifting regimen. sits right desk see time prompts it. performance staring face, miss day, feel like chart shaming me. nothing strenuous, push-ups, curls, leg lifts, etc, I'm seeing difference sure. It'll interesting ever go back work see co-workers' faces look noticeably different got shut down. Brain washing. starts ideas independence, personal freedom sovereignty. mixed lack education critical thinking. Throw bunch bs narratives masks virus get shit heads wasted lives selfish idiots trying waste people lives. something else entirely guy seem hit peak yet!

This pandemic really reaffirmed I've always believed country. Money important human lives cogs machine here. worked Publix little three years, loved everyone worked with.

I know Publix really fire people unless something really bad, move new store, department.

So maybe got bad transfer?

They take reviews management serious, know store meat department Manager written getting schedules shipments processed time.

Something brought people working him.

Hope kept stock. dividend checks good keep years come. Shockingly, social public health problems besides respiratory virus true Oxfords vaccine gives 91% immunity first dose? seems pretty huge Homelessness US mainly drug alcohol addiction mental illness Seems like good way discourage testing. Maybe close one 35 dies. knows? make mistakes held responsible. every police shooting mistake officer's part. Damn many ppl least friend. really sad part inadequacies stupidity full display 2018 election cycle better question honestly 40-45% population stupid oblivious think Ron DeSantis somehow good Florida? Oh. sudden spike?  Username checks out. ...uh...you looking date that...in January...this virus now. deserve much better general public especially government.  hope Nuremberg trials Trump era ends, options table sentencing. Same. boyfriend taking shit seriously. wash, soap water, perishables, wipe incoming items house, quarantine mail packages 3 days more. need waste disinfectant time purge haha regions Florida perhaps. I've mostly following Texas family lives there.

Given exponential growth though... surprised south whole run real ICU beds month. wear flat cap, one stupid tall hats.

Maybe meet sometime make lots love? Yes, let every day smell happens Mondays Wednesdays course. much - limited data longer term implications, definitely exist... lost count number American government officials (of level, mayors POSOTUS) boldly, openly, clearly said consider economy vastly important lives citizens. hope idea wearing masks future acceptable flu season. could really reduce spread too, maybe reduce medical costs. researchers doctors know taking seriously moderately impacted state. one going public unnecessarily, need to, shopping essentials, wearing masks, washing sanitizing hands frequently. one taking vacations travelling. Mirror behavior experts.

I feel weird staying home much lately people know taking road trips. made feel better. virus taken lightly. areas surging hard hit previously? ones I've seen NOLA Chicago, NOLA receding I'm sure % immunity Chicago right now. I've definitely heard complaints friends field nurses opinions exactly like ones here. One friends says ""there's always one every department"" (he's saying while, he's also issues nurses anti-vaxx crazy shit, new pandemic). 

That said, I'm sure they're quite stupid enough post something like publicly, would much hope it'd something hospital would take issue did. Banned sub? Really? Why? Okay.  ACC shutdown, time SEC forced to? Well, Quebec, Canada. October thru May, cold open windows. thing ""fresh outside air"". recirculated, re-breathed heated air months. January March real deep-freeze everyone gets sick something other. -30c can't open windows. Holy crap, say preferable. see worded question wrong. I'm bowing exchange appears I'm unclear. That's 1.2% death rate, super good news. (41,329 deaths 3,400,000 cases). apparent death rate hovering around 1.5% always qualified proviso capturing portion infected, those, mostly severe cases. it‚Äôs quality drugs coming worse. 

That belive legalization drugs. much dangerous stuff there. careful even buying weed. lot people still trying pass fake shit. Daily death toll US 2x higher... there‚Äôs scrambling. redhead risk group (45 lbs obsese), unaware this, gives reason optimism. Hopefully manage avoid getting lose 45 lbs though, January it'll running rampant America then. I‚Äôm curious, what‚Äôs solution this? Paying won‚Äôt help morale. it? It‚Äôs counterintuitive, winter spring Texans‚Äô outdoor season. can‚Äôt really spend much time outside summer you‚Äôd risk heat stroke. You‚Äôre supposed come sick, hospitals give ‚Äúoccurrences‚Äù (basically write ups), every time call in. many 6 month year period? get fired.

So it‚Äôs easy see much employees follow ‚Äúcall you‚Äôre sick‚Äù policy.

Some hospitals better others covid, even good hospitals covid leave policy make confusing criteria need meet get leave (symptoms, level exposure, testing, etc.), seems change daily. Full face respirators pretty hard breathe experience. use painting anything strenuous like biking skateboarding seem like would pass lungs would implode minutes... can't find hand sanitizer due shortage, put bottle water soap car? see harm Revenge gingers! Extra points 5GHz, cuz '5G'. phones may display that.

I guess really matter, e.g. Android tell you, hotspot internet connection, even unpaired open network? Yet another reason take break. deadly pandemic going around kills people lowered immune systems.

If ever time people take break, would it. get far weeds here, think big problem family *gatherings.* wife really needs see mother, understandable, stay away everyone else choose see other, getting tested regularly well would even better. That‚Äôs relatively safe long one risky activities anyone outside bubble. course do, New York Lombardy probably best off. Reminds old analysis mentioned China, approaching billion people time, could throw soldiers conflict consistently lose 10,000 day, it'd still take 27 *years* lose entire population. Would like speak manager? Worse, probably means 15% current product stocks going unsold risks potential deflation. think need look new doctor. trust guy children's well-being.

Many studies showing wearing mask beneficial harmful. perfer Comet cleaner myself, /S/ doesn‚Äôt explain influenza much worse COVID-19 less severe... death rate wasn‚Äôt solely due nursing homes. That‚Äôs representative determine virus worse other. That‚Äôs showing dangerous stupidity is. great practice talked enough, throwing clothes laundry coming home. saw movie outbreak similar thing ""clean"" rooms History also tells us takes two weeks measures noticeable. hospitals town ICU beds I‚Äôm Florida... 

Not say anything Florida going well... it‚Äôs shit show. ICU beds available, least today... ive actually lost 30 lbs result eating much. We've tried ignoring seem work! People ignoring hard enough, guess. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* idea nothing else fentanyl? mean retrospective analysis account deaths believe would say ~220,000 right believe another ~80,000 going die. fits roughly 1,000/day vaccine comes next 3 months. 

That ignores trailing 10-20 deaths/day likely experience next 2-4 years antivax population... presumes dont death flu like outbreaks killing another 30,000 every 1-3 years... 49,250,000 deaths go catch up! parent yesterday kids school brought child awaiting family members test. Test came back positive come pick kid. said never crossed mind ‚Äútheir‚Äù child would get it. Yesterday first day school. end day. 3 schools closed. fall winter going tear families apart. Yes sociopath. See stories like make wonder... people actually catching thing? really unpredictable Things getting worse, lets make even worse! Drinking¬†impairs¬†immune¬†cells key organs

By default,¬†alcohol¬†makes harder the¬†immune system¬†to gear defend body harmful germs. ‚ÄúAlcohol¬†has diverse adverse effects throughout body, including cells the¬†immune system, lead increased risk serious infections,‚Äù Easy life journalist days. post article everyday, change couple numbers looking wrong. tremendous testing! test anyone else world. testing like other...absolutely incredible! one tests better do!  /s find anything Infowars

Baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahahahaha!!! Agreed. point fomite transmission significant factor certain environments. SARS, MERS SARS2 utilize fomites within hospital setting. high traffic areas also risky regard‚Äîsubways, buses, schools etc. Plants drink water. Bleach water. Drinking bleach therefore healthy /s 9/11 every week, fine. long kind reporting taken knowledge reported number positives also woefully true numbers, clear picture. Keep mind 3 days 1 days assuming room temperature. cold-storage, virus viable 2 years. Ellen really aged well Don‚Äôt forget people said kidding, corrected that. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt kid‚Äù would hope comments suggest opposite does, although consumers also realize virus hitch ride point prior picking product including store checkout take precautions. That's rather problem :( yep, saw that.

so, B1G fan living SEC country, forced watch SEC football listen fans whoop up, team(s) sit sideline. great.

Don't get wrong, I'm happy B1G playing...I think truly best players, knowing know capability virus. talk able protect team utter made bullshite. kids going live like monks, get it, amount structured training environment, rigorous testing surveillance, hospital quality sanitation mitigation practices optimize health safety student-athletes

is going help get it...then general public hoping like crazy one unlucky ones. risk crazy.

Maybe SEC ACC think better it...but serious doubts. hand, south getting hit pretty hard... Exceptions rules. proximity two world class cities.

I totally get concern regarding politics geography, one *particularly* bad given Minnesota known for. shitshow. 1. Take 10 year term life insurance every member family beneficiary. riskier/less careful person, money policy.

2. Hold couple family gatherings. Make sure hug many people possible, share drinks cups, etc.

3. Profit $$$$$$$$

/s pleasant, well-run facility I‚Äôd happily go rather infect family. Heck, wish place could go meals cooked, tissues meds brought me, etc. get properly rest nasty cold. Plus facility could supervision nurse could keep tabs escalate hospital Doctor needed care. I‚Äôve always thought real silver lining burkas. hoping pandemic normalize mask wearing enough see masks flu season. young kids spouse middle school teacher. get many colds sniffles school year. stopped talking Pelosi House negotiating team. McConnell never even participated, White House absent. deal alone. 

States go bankrupt, assistance stop, people turn looting access food. honestly think Republican plan get trump reelected. Allegedly Putins daughter already received That‚Äôs refer as... Mississippi Governor murderer Tate Reeves. 

I hope he‚Äôs judged god jury. 3.4 million people England -- 6% population -- contracted coronavirus, infection rates twice high London, **a major antibody study found**.

Not quoting context, even quoting full sentence. Come man Hmm, written 'has', 'have'. Ah well, fuck it. One day bro. unfortunately, today day. Hell, year year either. disagree comment, comment responding connected NYC experience herd immunity: 

""There's plenty evidence""

And comment pointing nothing NYC's response herd immunity. fact recent areas surges worst hit initial months pandemic.  Lakshman Guruswamy, professor international environmental law, advised us‚Äîwhen questioned could climate change‚Äîto bunch kids eat frozen food.  
  
I wonder inadvertently help. Lmao dude you‚Äôre fucking cross one thought joke funny that‚Äôs hilarious. I. survival chances hospitalization admission ICU dramatically correlated age likelihood requiring hospitalization first place.

People need hospitalization overwhelmingly older exist large enough numbers countries trigger high death rate relative overall population. three months

a year Ah fellow D-man born late 90s, nice meet ya mean, even check New Zealand, there's plenty data every major think tank research institution says lockdowns necessary. cant get results week more, even start? mess. difference structural embrace crazies US. Australia NZ fine. Canada ok.  Yes things combined make unlikely used:

- Americans pay exorbitant sums medical treatment.

- Airlifts often paid approved insurance company without pre-authorization absolute proof absolutely necessary.

- Air-lifting someone immediate urgent life threatening situation incredibly hard tell someone really bad chest cold urgent need medical treatment pneumonia. 

- People denial illness, ""oh I'm fine"" ""It's bad,"" late. 

You bunch people every incentive go hospital 'til last moment, plus medical system punish life crippling debt make call prematurely actually desperately need airmed... people get use it. 100% confirmed, Vitamin deficiency best evidence base explanation.

Woohoo! long last many hours spend week riding bike wife moans complains justified maintaining immunity C-19.

I always knew cycling would good long run! Live. Laugh. Revolt. allow surveys like this. need apologize sub rules removal going reversed. I'm seeing locally, vast majority people wear mask outside, live mask mandated state (NJ), requires wearing mask outside situations can't social distance. Hell, might even Flintstone Vitamins  favorite part say, I'm little disappointed see many ""educated"" medical professionals promoting unsafe, baseless practices seemingly forgetting foundational knowledgeüò¨ ***None even touches negative health impacts caused extended mask use

I think especially funny previously directly mentions mask prevents spit leaving mouth infecting, say, patient operating table... seems think could way help contain virus know transmitted droplets. mad *other* health care staff ""forgetting foundational knowledge"" even though managed span single post. (Assuming person actually nurse, given.) What? ugly government want citizens picture both. doubt China's numbers exact. But, could 2x higher *still* two orders magnitude less US deaths, know sure undercounted.

There's way hell death count much deniers would like us believe. Especially think they're somehow hiding hundreds thousands new COVID deaths every day fully-reopened cities. Chinese citizens might live authoritarian rule risk arrest worse dissent ""disturbing public order"", even remain quiet tens thousands neighbours fell ill started dying. Honestly want better world everyone can't stand people condescending. feel obligated call out. appreciate man, wish best you! AM-See ya later. 


It's cinema, hygiene theater. Shh sub likes interpret statistics scariest way possible. Don‚Äôt rain fear parade people love talk personal responsibility never wanna hold cops accountable ü§î essentially they're holding americans American financial support hostage passes though right ?  


Aren't trying throw second relief act bill? 


They'd rather average american starved business owner sued complete disdain human life. I‚Äôm skeptical number since people say it‚Äôs counted due states correctly classifying/counting covid deaths others say it‚Äôs overcounted since deaths even remotely caused covid counted covid.

Does anyone unbiased chart covid deaths? would say 13% indeed nearing threshold, even data entirely correct. Good thing essential employees police get decent wages, retirement plans, health insurance.....oh...wait. It‚Äôs itself. It‚Äôs sign women particular, bill low, miserable tip also low. want split meal two plates too. people share plate share dish. 

They sit forever, you‚Äôre unable turn table quickly make money. Four women splitting two entrees drinking iced tea- always iced tea- $30.00 gets like two dollar tip. run ragged. Constantly asking things. rude it. condescending.

Damn. miss serving! 

I got tipped fifty cents lunch tab two women. counted least dozen trips table. fifty cents.  media worst. husband keeps telling close it‚Äôs like much else do!

You sound like me. I'm stuck home nothing do, news social media 24/7. I'm looking free courses online (coursera, edx, etc) use time improve myself. Get reddit, facebook, news sites.

Watch bob ross videos silly shows, yoga, doodle notebook, make stupid lists, take walk, challenge many squats jumping jacks throughout day, learn new language duolingo app(just examples, find whatever activities enjoy). small changes helped anxiety days. daily reddit time lol. foot bill 2 week stay associated expenses food? say influenza worse. even data long term effects covid. would it? You‚Äôre making baseless assumptions. Sweden didn‚Äôt lock didn‚Äôt 2/3 population infected. kid want wear one?"" 

I'm infuriated this. Like, every parent went already shirts pants. *Somehow* fucking managed without fit throwing thinly veiled ""Fuck politics"" every chance I'm laughing ass it.

Well that's nice him. power end in-person instruction take it? moved Washington can't even go Vancouver. üò™ always thought people said going leave elected official silly it‚Äôs going ‚Äúthat bad‚Äù.

Vote. President Leatherface! Oh needed alright time AMC re-open theaters fifteen-cent ticket price get people door! I'd rather like Europe, Singapore Australia &amp; New Zealand. either China US.

I mean way US run basically third world country. Indeed! Also late Feb / early March. amount conflicting actions taken US vs. nations time led logical conclusion better safe dead, especially higher risk individuals home. continue wipe groceries packages. latest news store surfaces frozen packaging China reinforce usefulness wiping surfaces. You‚Äôre probably OK outside drinks flow, voices rise, people lose track distancing. Personally don‚Äôt want anyone within 10 feet outside. refuse go inside restaurants bars. Curbside take using help businesses trying survive follow rules. hell ones breaking rules. fail start growing food seems. back VICTORY GARDENS la ww2 basically cytokine storm. 
This bad news, right? part made pandemic flu deadly suggests young people could vulnerable hoped. Well CDC exactly say ""go back in-person school.""  tons caveats ignored lots places. Bullshit, american school education bad since decades somehow new technologys fault? ""twitter personality"" somehow makes guy credible?

Right - explanation cases continuing rise Texas. That's positive rates skyrocketing algorithms suggest case numbers increasing.

Saying ""I'm really sure put stock it"" ins't reasonable argument. yet fair amount working class still socialism unions? hell? numbers frightening, find odd people would rather ""chance"" getting sick prove point. simple mask that's sense even common sense there's much go around seems. 

I'm hoping turn around folks. Sooner rather later... Right. assume everyone workout home stupid. costs shit ton money weightlifting gear, treadmill, apartment douchey throwing dumbbells shit around So, hear you, first all. read article long ago stated, essentially, sun avoidance akin smoking 1 pack cigarettes per day. wake-up call sure. 

But article also **very** clear use sunscreen inhibited production Vitamin D. may also want reconsider? look article. Worked fast food bit yeah would try teach correct way new kids cannot behind everyone tried best, heck even manager cut corners order us leave early go past scheduled closing would get trouble. Things cleaned half-assed. Hmm thing Alex Jones fears, new world order government pay us stay home it‚Äôs safe...  COVID scam Big Toothpaste could use trillion dollars blank check Fed authorized conduct research better understand prevalence 'rona. Congress already passed many stimulus packages, appropriate funds random samples? 

I problem assuming worst beginning, know problem little better now. Instead accurate prevalence information, know better worse countries based testing differences, dont know transmission rate. know prevelance needed herd immunity. know much transmitted schools every state closed schools end March U.S., there's mixed results studies done countries. That's never got stage real contact tracing. 


Our testing infrastructure may catch problem. lack leadership toxic individualism exceptionalism haven‚Äôt wearing mask prevent measles entire life? Probably it‚Äôs negligible risk everyone accepts. People aren‚Äôt going wear masks forever they. America know 90% them. 

Some states completely given contact tracing. Doesn‚Äôt change fact eat fewer calories burn, lose weight. laws thermodynamics still apply obese much lean. used obese maintained athletic, lean BMI ten years IIFYM exercise. [SARS-CoV-2-related mortality rural Latin American (not IFR) 1.6% one village Ecuador seroprevalance 45%. course healthcare available good. still hyperbolic say everyone live like they're going die soon, think also hyperbolic say virus make hospitals completely unusable. Even height peak New York back April still space hospitals. I‚Äôm flying Europe Atlanta (dying parent must see). scared be? USA, lack covid prevention, two.will flourish together, high probability death rate spike way higher. 

How accepted 1,500 deaths day acceptable, idea. worry 10,000 day bother Republicans. Sounds like America Essential = Expendable. respect power-5 college football, I'd hard pressed find one schools very, good hospital campus. I'd harder pressed find one require students health insurance. addition, scholarship athletes also insured.

Consider University FL, world-class medical center campus. Many kids South Florida glades area best thing find within 30 miles minute-clinic CVS. Back home, likely also around parents grandma. Maybe I'm missing something, else USA insured, &lt;5 minutes world-class hospital, surrounded medical nutritional staff not-preferable?

European soccer leagues, MLS NBA already proven athletics work environment rigorous testing safety protocols. instructed male stranger smile months. fantastic. guess I'm following line reasoning. think Spanish flu killed everyone could people left alive people could survive therefore offspring similarly resistant? That's novel theory would likely gain lot traction epidemiologists true. suggest flesh thesis actual data run it. Please dm complete. Yes.

Yeah specifically COVID thing although certainly possible could contribute ""standard"" ICU delirium. lot similar risk factors ICU delirium might hospitalize COVID patient. 

Then respiratory fight ARDS get even higher doses sedation medications. Plus ventilator weeks possibly. people coming ICU ventilators thier brains absolutely scrambled. Dude fucking blows right now


At place I'm bartending service well, taking least 5 tables, barbacking


Yet people coming can't seem get heads restaurants skeleton crews right now, we're half killing people still treat us like garbage. second thought was, vitamin tests see? study race though (in relation covid), direct correlation test levels) friendly note everyone thinking level point near future - unemployment Great Depression took full 3 years Goddamn man. really love proving superior are. It‚Äôs must awe-inspiring mere presence.

It‚Äôs doctor, it‚Äôs doctor since diagnosis close 20 months ago. doctor works Duke prestigious medical center who‚Äôs seen us clinic, ER, inpatient stays outpatient procedures. man point afternoon stick needle spine inject chemotherapy him. 

And you‚Äôre still answering questions? different oh knowledgeable one? want bloodwork? platelets 181 doctor says it‚Äôs safe LP maybe tell wait see thoughts are? obese something almost entirely control individual outside rare cases.

That's really true though. people obese *want* be, like people *want* anxious depressed addicted. significant neurological differences people obese vs counterparts. Obesity usually tied mood disorders eating disorders. Thank service country. Even link Vitamin levels proven vit supplements cheap wouldn‚Äôt best people take anyway might help health conditions well. interest say felt ill since February / March end October beginning November?

There accounts people early late February still can‚Äôt go flight stairs without wheezing. 

Sadly, stories people actually believed drinking sanitizer injecting bleach would help them, even drinking cow urine. Even people think they‚Äôre healthy may undiagnosed preexisting conditions... yet closed them? saying herd immunity goal really bad it? really think enough people take vaccine won‚Äôt even wear masks? started week ago already moving virtual. point sending kids back constant switch in-person distance whenever somebody tests positive? kids learn anything constantly change learning environments? 

It would better done distance beginning, one country make right decision. lol, airing pbs rn. Except political sharing opinion think wearing mask pain ass many people (outside echo chamber sub) agree me.

[75% Americans support wearing isn‚Äôt much echo chamber. Plowman said 20 28 positive cases campus students, remaining eight cases university employees. Officials said 155 people currently self-isolating due potential exposure.  
  
Can‚Äôt wait another wave cut life 10 years early see feels? NIH vaccine Oxford 2 decent candidates hopefully show successful efficacy signal. rollout still going take time though. NYC even outdoor dining close comfort me. Certainly six feet guests cases. Take scientists! Uno reverse! So, bar restaurant. Never understood hell hard staying home risk lives. Yeah bf friends work restaurant/bar industry we're trying support exactly case. I'm person actually putting mask seat. Bar full 60 people 4 masks see bartender, barback, server myself. reasonable afraid Trxmp loses he‚Äôll try suppress vaccine therapeutic production make Bxden look bad gate? Within week? likely, deaths lag well know I'm sure stories weeks Same. say young americans healthier now, often unhealthy different ways though...

For instance, instead obesity, 1918, many young Americans malnourished vitamin deficiencies due lack access balanced complete diet many cases. Another factor life expectancy much lower back technology extend life old age do. disease primarily kills elderly people would dead shit 1917. 

Actually, older demographics alive 1918 higher survival rate spanish flu routine flu seasons. Why? Older Americans exposed another deadly flu pandemic, 1889 Russian flu, may given immune systems leg 1918 virus, killed young adults prime lives rather old infirm like usual.

&amp;#x200B;

I agree though different variables play among two pandemics come two different families viruses. Statistically, tests ideal regardless wait times, allows better track vrius.

On individual level though, less testing faster results might ideal. friend lives Florida recently get tested came contact customer later informed store tested positive. quarantine got tested. soonest could get tested 3 days later. test results took almost week get back inform negative could get back work. spend almost 10 days quarantine making base pay (he works commission) results took forever get back him.

That get excess testing Bill gates referred worthless tests. People reluctant still jobs getting shafted overabundance testing limited capacity process tests appropriate time. needs prioritization testing done outside hospitals. would definitely see positivity rate go able notify people faster (within 1-2 days rather week later), could eventually lower rate quarantining people sooner rather later.

P.S. - advocating less testing, I'm advocating prioritization testing based capacity. capacity process tests goes up, testing go up. idea talking about. reply fraught bad english false information. Stay school, folks... 3rd August today, testing varied 86k 12k (7.2x), whilst positives varied 11.5k 4.5k (2.5x). 

I'm curious think Also none anything said earlier. said there's correlation, fluctuations.

There's clear correlation positive rates increasing testing rates decrease. I'm still testing positive 1 month initial symptoms initial 14 day quarantine.... even now? Dr said I'm ok about. nurse got mad told wait car told quarantine 10 days. I'm confused.... symptoms 5 days. Coronaviruses (like one) live surfaces make sick touch eyes, mouth, nose. think CDC recommends hand washing? 

I suggest stop getting information Karen Facebook try reading credible scientific sources.  Yeah, businesses need open survive. need closed stop spread shit. government step help people lose businesses.  Pay bills, payrolls, everything allowing open. Seems simple enough. Mass deaths people drowned lung secretions died home... Kinda proves flu tbh started taking vitamin months ago first became apparent correlation levels vit. covid I'm honestly amazed much better feel taking them. actually proof flu spread surface contamination. reason tell people wash hands protect fecal-oral transmission routes stuff like E. Coli Yeah, know first thing talking someone ask job decide whether treat like person not, treating people respect give reason otherwise totally foreign concept here.
How could forgotten? evidence catch covid-19 again. Remember 8 months old there's much evidence saying either way. science Leary say cannot catch again. would feel relatively confident getting together someone know recovered covid-19 sure. Maybe two weeks ago two months ago absolutely. 'Obesity usually tied mood disorders eating disorders'

Well, that's fat activists want us believe. performed disinfection theatre prevent limited fomite spread. welcome back students petri dish continue infecting droplets aerosol spread. going cycle while. much viral load receive may determine sick get. Poor Irish people. heart goes you.

 there, way classes, walked past 17 pubs every day. Cant imagine Dublin pubs closed :( watch lot news never saw quote, compared places leaders Jack shit, looks like genius. Even sending people back nursing homes, terrible idea (unless alternative worse, idk could worse) copied Lee, DeSantis, Abbott even three months everyone knew terrible idea.  Testing..... one seems really know yet.. Fighting per capita testing rates based size, spread, different levels government feel disingenuous.

The US 5 times population, 6x budget. **That's federal budget way**. CDC used discredited Stanford study that. 

Stanford investigating scientists study political bias (and turns funded Airline founder disclose fact). Human decency?  totally understand feeling. I'm trying make permanent decisions relationships I'm understand stress, especially family close friends. neighbors absolutely go eff themselves. change 1918 flu ""that"" bad! may die that's sacrifice I'm willing make. Active member either r/Conservative r/Conspiracy?

Check. definition insanity thing expecting different result. Making comparisons military raid school reopenings ridiculous.

It tells Gov DeathSentence grasping straws he's trying justify actions GOP partners CoV mess created Responsible FL. understanding important Vitamin relatively new understanding. really discovered last 10 20 years. Bro nobody takes shit seriously. One biggest disconnects see working restaurant right people wear mask get table, sometimes putting walk in, put back whenever get use bathroom leave. defeats whole fuckin point wearing mask seated. maybe strong unions bad thing all? John Hammond similar philosophy. many deaths attributed virus spread high school? students keeling COVID? I'm still weeding acquaintances understand asymptomatic means Hell (aka Georgia). Typical scenario along lines of:

""my coworker tested positive yesterday. shared drink went lunch (why would pay TWO beverages? Overpriced..) day. started feeling bad got tested next day feel *just* fine - way it. reason wear stuffy mask work public, cause Legionnaire's ya know. I'm damn sure getting tested, sticks poke brain. Oh! kids, cuddle kiss daily, first day school today. School says wear masks that's violation rights health concern, told refuse provided face covering. one requires masks flu season covid crap different. "" might interesting compare illnesses based timelines spread. C19 takes lot longer spread kill people spanish flu took mere days, C19 take weeks. compress C19 timeline spanish flu timeline, wonder would look like? living breathing extra effort since February 2019 friend.

Unless requires read scientific study You‚Äôre infectious disease expert,

Neither oncologist, looking studies well. lot people vitamin deficient don‚Äôt go outside don‚Äôt drink milk. didn‚Äôt know milk drinking fortified Vitamin D, cheese dairy isnt Actually number PCR plus antibody. AZ combines reporting public. go onto dashboard see individually. Taken separately, PCR fell 6% yesterday. Recovery != immunity. virus test negative... would mean recovery (unless test false negative, seem common compared false positives).

So yes, negative test means recover (if previously tested positive).

I swear, doublespeak nonsense gets really old really fast. Nah way. can't erase memory whole nations incompetence covid deniers isn‚Äôt death rate/death count high enough change minds. laughed 1, 50, 1,000. 165,000 denial ever. It‚Äôs doc supervision ! go back bloodwork supplements. People thread scaring random dosage. careful. slow dosage , take like 5 drops day cant recall IU . Instead weekly high dose. gotta go back make sure I‚Äôm good 3 months

Edit : doc ( sure 100%) said best place get sun exposure , supplements , food. People need get outside !  really something fascinating history. 9/11, entire country rallied together. People left lives joined services. Daily vigils held. comforted other. world sent prayers. 

Now faced 70x casualties soil, end sight, look acting? really boggle mind. anything, would thought 2nd Amendment ""patriot"" crowd would this. Except opposite? Fascinating &amp; sad phenomenon. surprising. Higher unemployment we've seen since great depression global pandemic exacerbate people's mental issues. Suicides, drug overdoses, etc rise every time recession. [For It‚Äôs completely moronic haven‚Äôt funded national program promote outdoor dining. you‚Äôve ever travelled Europe you‚Äôll know propane heaters blankets eat outdoors much year. places massive parking lots could converted support outdoor dining. going take away indoor dining fall? kill restaurants limped long.

This coming someone Great Lakes region. Yeah would definitely times wouldn‚Äôt work, could eat outside heaters deep November start March. takes leadership innovation. see hard COVID patient cough bunch surfaces measure # viable viruses time. 1918 - ""this black plague, cold""

Probably. Rhetorical want response?  gym KY open quite while. Never issue kept calling hoax nothing. first major issue major populated areas. Urban areas almost vote Blue. voter suppression tactic. take least two process it‚Äôs still W backache fucks hell whence came, that's happy enough me. put down. concession well wish. about: wish happiness success whatever pursue life. sounds great me. people wearing mask zero harm me, could make less likely get sick. 

i would thrilled result people US wearing masks highly doubt it. lot chain restaurants already anyway. helpful people care put mouths. time I've never heard issue people EDs. suppose restaurants could print menus without calories think might help customers. think there's pretty strong case made ancient humans eating fish.

Our teeth suited it; eat many fish raw; nutrients many fish well proportioned dietary requirements; without iodine people get sick. primates eat fish, orangutans even hunt makeshift tools. Animal remains northern Kenya show almost 2 million years ago humans eating fish regularly. Whatever is, wrong something change. Old habits die hard, though, gonna take work. 

I glad said something, reminded article scared pretty good first read committed making changes ever make. I'm AZ UV plentiful, less zero excuse. ;) Florida screwed they'll simply turn irradiation. ever tell got placebo? Like later line, goes production want dose? EU recommending 12 hours per case contact tracing, that'd almost 40.000 hours day, 8 hour work days, need 5000 people working per day. hide testing deaths. Right ban travel Africa  Luckily biggest risk category. understand word addiction means?

Quarantine better economy 100% population infected, far people need read it, won't. did, believe it. Willful ignorance sad dangerous.  Except fudge little shop dock pathetic part fast food actually whether dine get drive through.

Like, get it. good restaurant quality steak eaten hot grill. Big Mac? Really? wanna risk death *that?* Lemme guess.. Masks, testing, contact tracing... using common sense?

How close I? Isnt myocardial inflammation perimyocarditis typical sequelae many kinds viral infections? virus spreads primarily though airborne droplets. long dining done outdoors, server wearing mask chances transmission plummet. UV Ray's sun also help decrease chances transmission. say possible get sick, outdoor dining decreases chances enormously. New Jersey allowed door dining managed keep rate transmission 1 months now. long time ago read tale (so grain salt here) people UK mutation plague made less immune HIV. Early Corona read interacts bodies similarly HIV. pure conjecture wonder mutation.

But musings dude. Wow need slow read better. Thank you. remember suggesting college subs students start thinking taking GAP year.

I never banned subs quickly life. 

There clearly groups interested keeping university $$$ going. Every life evaluate acceptabel cost it. Othervise would max 30 km/h highways. Forbid fatty foods sugar foods. cigarets alkohol. Etc. Eveything calculated acceptabel loss life vs costs society. I‚Äôm trying find exactly classless society existed? hasn‚Äôt. hey since inequality creeping back towards levels seen since feudalism, not?

There's evidence significant % people (%20-50) T-cell immunity originating coronaviruses. might seeing action. People high functioning T-cells able neutralize virus quickly becomes endemic. theory one worth considering yet closed them? 

No [they know it. missed nice opportunity learn saying herd immunity goal really bad it?

I'm saying Tegnell fanboys repeatedly claim closed impact pandemic""* *""[herd goal.""*        
And proof (if doubts remained) Tegnell knew schoolchildren contributing spread used help goal herd immunity.         
Tegnell lied swedes used like ginea pigs. ""news"" parents listen says they're DOUBLE COUNTING!!! librals trying make Trump look bad know reality best bestest prescient is!

/s might technically less deadly per infection, infects much people you‚Äôd still expect cause deaths overall. USC researchers found likely order COVID-19 symptoms first appear: fever, cough, muscle pain, nausea, and/or vomiting, diarrhea.


First paragraph, apparently order. That's one person every minute upstairs neighbor began jumping jacks apartment wasn‚Äôt appreciated. shock - would thought possible.ü§¨ Guess - opening schools going consequence. Sick &amp; dead staff &amp; kids. everything sight, it? stuff come direct hands people may well covid. people claim ""worst crisis time"".

Judging lockdowns, I'm sure I'm going agree there.

When last time single country acted way, much less entire world? It‚Äôs behavioral disorder compounded vicious cycle bad choices, fine. I‚Äôm afraid clinical treatment essentially bad choices leads excuses. even reopen school? robot something? None say makes sense. email 12th June. understand even still arguing like this.

Funny mention FiveThirtyEight, considering forecaster mentioned website frequently cited reliable forecaster Nate Silver himself, plenty others like Eric Topol :) think afraid people find achieve health fitness creative going gym. mean literally, sounds like get point taking suitable precautions. Well, oversimplifying. Murder crime. [Im Afraid really. colleges move til late August/September. justify overdosing vitamin D?
It doesn‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt dumb. Take check levels annually. take 2500 units day I‚Äôm liberal sun exposure. check levels (1) make sure I‚Äôm deficient (2) make sure levels aren‚Äôt high. 
Don‚Äôt cut nose spite face. choose drugs research, cannot research time, live universe planet finite resources. 

More data means data. difference need go grocer every 2-3 weeks shop efficiently, whereas eating would daily.

So apples/apples comparison.  probably spread UK January wearing mask, also wearing pants! Well, believe want to. That's fine.

As explained, pieces puzzle. theory tested. Feel free research yourself, there's plenty reading there.

And yes, repeat myself, simply understand saying ""Oh yea 100% certain, cells definitely protecting us all"".

That's works. scientists process figuring out, get fed studies bit bit fairly certain theory correct. CDC said [the antibody tests wrong half that's probably even good way determine many people infected. USA boldly stumbling herd immunity strategy even know herd immunity thing. Murica! regular sanitation mask wearing weaken immune systems pathogens? get wrong, I'm nearly worried enough stop, argument used come good response. I'm also curious there's sort validity point. CEO could easily replace drive thru worker trained job. enjoy job (no one does) trivial do. take order type computer. take payment. move items B. requires skills get day on-the-job training. Huh? ""You too"" polite nice thing say. get bent shape it? Would rather told f*ck off?  US currently averaging equivalent 17 zero-survivor Boeing 747 plane crashes every single week, due covid. I, one, welcome new redhead overlords Sounds like think needed taught lesson something never said May ask procedures are? telling do? go back checkups periodically? I‚Äôm curious  really causes Beijing outbreak still unknown. market mostly vegetable. Seafood, including salmon, another seafood wholesale market miles away. market completely clean found virus. 

However Dalian outbreak linked imported seafood. Yes, agree mask-wearing normalized, become default many suggest. Want go dance club? mask. Want go mosh punk show? mask. Want go eat dinner friends? mask. 

While masks make life safe, lot joy life (at least me) comes activities involve assuming marginal amount risk. encourage masks people times feel need them, destroy entertainment. fully support Covid lockdowns, risk Covid significantly higher run mill diseases traditionally spread, I'd ok assuming risk catching flu fulfilling enjoyable life. Could good episode House MD too. took cash March broke first $20 last week. lot places even taking cash due coin shortage. true. students wanna get quick reps gym. No. scientific study. website repeating CDC/WHO guidance. Link one single study proves SARS-COV2 fomite transmission. dad went opthamalogist. doctor banned patients waiting area (you wait car get text they're ready). limited staff, another nurse/aid. They're wearing N95's gave disposable surgical mask. tricky part i'm sure often doctor/staff tested. physician friends said testing still limited, even hospital healthcare workers. Frontline staff may tested every 2 3 weeks. non-acute practitioners like optometrists may tested month that. Personally would look prevalence area demographic make eye doctor's clients. s/he serves blue collar shift workers (like optician Walmart Costco), there's higher chance covid exposure. actually say order symptoms anywhere?  That's like saying "" people continue die car crashes long allow drinking driving"". context actually highlights negligence even more. steps taken gets really....REALLY bad. Like actually toilet paper available bad.

That point already came went. steps taken. all. infecting young healthy end world considering separated families. younger demographic always gets hit flu season deadlier corona yet one gave fuck 2020. vast majority India live slums. 

Source: Live India slum. one mysterious one me. Like clearly meant one-off defensive line immediately run away rest conversation starts.

How next thought sane person's head not, ""Oh, OK... 200,000 people dying US... completely random unrelated causes... normal 6 month period, like scariest shit ever!!""

Like, sounds better people dying identifiable reason known virus tracking? maybe causes death suddenly different similar reasons started becoming dangerous people exact time? 

It's one thing claim deaths. actually get that. can't ""see"" 200,000 dead people. take other's word it? guess. explain away deaths like that? think know saying. Less likely statistical, epidemiological statement. relevant personal risk. Eat Plandemic Steakhouse. group 5 least one going hospital later knows might even die. non dying patrons receive 50% coupon good towards future visits. 

I'd certainly flock there! /s I'm reading, could similar reactions malaria. Type lack antigens B have, tend asymptomatic malaria carriers. Since Covid complications largely based immune overreaction (cytokine storm), triggered antigens blood, would explain lot. Ew. I'd rather take lizard people. sure mean take you‚Äôre sports right now. understand that. 

However, I‚Äôm studying go sports (data analytics) specific sports come back, tell right along professional athletes required get vaccine. 

So goal call athletes won‚Äôt work. Athletes people work teams work sports want sports come back full swing. taking vaccine means come back full swing, guarantee take becomes widely available corona... Thank you. mind chat I'm checking out. Well, let's see. Trump's racist Mexicans. Us woke people know Mexico lovely country deserve wall us them.

So.... Mexico?

Or go country that's *more white* USA prove much hate racist Trump. PA 700ish excess deaths week July. Look May though, example. Excess deaths per week May 100 reported Covid deaths per week roughly 500-1000 per week. kind disconnect reporting gathering numbers, perhaps lag ""excess death"" estimates. Yes can, expose allot surface area skin absorb enough toxic. use allot often.

If small squirt hands occasionally would likely hurt you.

I would still use methanol-based sanitizer keep car occasion can't wash. woefully inadequate amount testing done early on, studies discovering exponentially people actually surprise least.

It could possibly ripped communities without anyone really even noticing much difference. also verifiable evidence **the sweeping majority cases** result hospitalization, much less death.

Using outliers draw conclusions pretty much opposite supposed do. let's freak hell something 0.05% chance killing you, **if** get it. use basic precautions hygiene likely get virus.

Even mask extra, already said numerous experts likely (by far) way contract virus touching something contaminated. nearly likely inhaling droplets virus. know also significantly lowers quality life?

People also use release unrelated anger pain someone working retail would never dare person street. think everyone required work retail month.... Brazil US vie highest number covid deaths every day... Given treat farm laborers, countries probably worried importing frozen US meats.  quick read shows common sense actually, factually incorrect. paper reviewed, way gaiters make higher possible transmission stated, logically sound.

Specifically, measured particles leaving speaking, particles observed people wearing gaiters/bandanas face covering all.

The hypothesis thin fabric atomizes droplets speech even smaller droplets linger air longer, improving chances transmission.

But hey, right doomer stirred maybe? Naw Brazil honor Hey believe wanna believe. See wanna see. said nothing paranoid people going around killing people, said that.

Thank laugh. took spread care homes deaths spiked then? Elderly people especially care homes ones travelling working getting virus initial phase. look excess mortality (the reliable number have, available late decisive action), true number Covid deaths UK like total excess mortality change reclassify cause death, timeline perspective, Covid likely cause excess mortality. UK got Covid control, weekly deaths even lower average mortality.

So reclassify 4k deaths currently counted Covid deaths, means additional 4k deaths already labeled ""other cause"" ""unknown cause"" also Covid. paraphrase somebody long dead: terrible died faster could burried.

You probably gene that‚Äôs makes ‚Äúhave less‚Äù ace2 receptor, means covid-19 less opportunity infect you. currently treated Covid die, regardless tested positive 1 week ago 10 weeks ago, death count towards death toll. 

The point method stop labelling deaths individuals recovered covid covid deaths. Ayyy, I'm going NZ too. I'm afraid COVID/Trump final nail coffin. Alaska *was* gonna last hurrah want out. GF/fiancee makes sense live there. Make sure research immigration website. *quite* overwhelming read information. first NBA player contracted virus rudy gobert. tested positive already played games teams days prior also hes constant close contact team everything together(travel,practice). odd one player team contracted it.

I know possible occurring, find hard believe widespread issue completely skewing numbers. think new clause Hippocratic Oath explicitly allows people want die avoid care, choose many ways COVID19 return NZ. Quarantine breaches, travelers remaining infectious quarantine, virus surviving imported goods, virus transferring ships dock workers etc. Quarantine hygiene measures need fail virus return. Last time checked suspect contaminated cold chain imports spreading COVID workers NZ.

The idea persistent community spread occurring NZ weeks max taken seriously public health authorities even general public. people treating possibility low information Americans accepted pervasive spread virus country normal completely unaware testing containment measures going countries. would difficult relax restrictions vaccinated people leave us systems place today.

Even precautions school taking - mask policy, MERV filters, hiring extra nurses, renting space outdoor instruction Disney level precautions.... I'm still shocked dismayed they're trying open. 

Why... why? puts pressure teachers afraid want come in, spreads disease, endangers lives, overburdens healthcare system... One sick person needlessly got coronavirus take innocent doctor trying save lives. 

So many vectors transmission - nannies, subways/buses Uber school, interactions... just.... Why?

The New Zealand case also seems little like trying hide something want plastered news person brought back country, lol. Would public enemy #1, could see they'd lie find scapegoat. Meijer fake union. pay $10 week absolutely nothing. surprise. Test trace isolate

We like 50% cases currently untraceable Please pray me. really hope go restaurant Birthday February. matter way look though cases still declining. math see yourself. See percent decrease overall testing compare percent decrease cases, average past 2 weeks. i'm actually skeptical numbers.... seems random sample survey... Respondents opted signed up, there's huge amount self-selection bias. know LA County sero surveys composition participants greatly affects results outbreaks tend hit one community sub-population skip another.

As far under-reporting, remember antibody studies mainly reveal who're asymptomatic mildly symptomatic. US even get tested March April unless high grade fever consecutive days. still today California they're limiting testing obvious symptoms known exposure positives kits limited &amp; labs backed up. you‚Äôre saying that, means you‚Äôre it.

It's still textbook recovery. articles hyperbolic nonsense used perpetuate paralyzing COVID fear. Covid nurse here, positive asymptomatic required work hospital even though infect staff members.

You're staying home high fevers, shortness breath, extreme symptoms get hospitalized.

Work Florida Yes, 'murica Inaccurate. recession caused lockdowns, that's essentially what's done younger generations. It'd worse 65s surely.

Possibly older people developed immunity common cold years ago. Fair enough, already flat down-turned way less death rate Cuomo.

Look, goal praise them, vilify cuomo, find amazing, given numbers, people praising cuomo whil villifying them. I've seen people still lasting shortness breath can't exercise used even trouble breathing walking going stairs. people end like can't go back routine.

And agree still loss taste/smell serious symptom recovering. using example lasting symptom people mean, ideally hybrid schedule allows proper social distancing.

In reality, schools way twice crowded without spreading COVID-19. *Maybe* went one day week online self study rest time could get low enough, point might well full time remote. follow fox entertainment news tells them. fox news said climate change big problem would suddenly among loudest voices calling action. fox news said wear masks save lives fellow americans would start attacking anyone wearing mask. one saying shelter place indefinitely, get control. people got impatient antsy opened way soon, rendering situation practically uncontainable, plus apparently wearing masks isn‚Äôt cool freedom. wouldn‚Äôt indefinitely. would intense stint months really careful, protracted, science-based opening.

Instead, this.

It's actually kind sad story alcoholism among poor. E-Rod :( Thats still pretty bad. Sweden (pop. 10 million) 4 times number cases Ontario (15 million) despite affected earlier time get control.  


Guess shutting bad idea. emphasize none specimens culture positive, indicating possibility identified noninfectious viral genome many, most, cases. ""  means viral particles fall air, land surfaces (duh). study proves nothing. forget Floods? You‚Äôre idiot, started gender bias bullshit. specific gender assumption abuse power. Men women abuse power, I‚Äôm sure felt need single women throw temper tantrum someone calls bullshit it‚Äôs related safety aviation. include passenger safety. wasn‚Äôt ever clear picked instead difference CDC lied masks months plenty evidence suggest fact helpful. Actually think so.


Upon Google searching, yes. Flu's CFR 0.1%, IFR around 0.01% via many estimates. shows cases varied much less 

Right, that's shows. believe that's There's clear correlation positive rates increasing testing rates Obviously is. understand unfortunately I'm sick explaining 100th Anyway, still explained hospitalizations much whilst cases exponentially increasing. Neither explained TMC reporting 15% states tests, whilst 10% positive rate. Neither explained CLI ILI data Texas plummeting. Neither explained deaths plateauing whilst cases still exponentially NEITHER anything every say explain possible greater houston area, according TMC, reporting 30k new tests DAILY, TOTAL state truth single supplemental factor apart % positive supportive argument infections truly increasing. single one. others supporting opposite view. best projection website US, still estimating Rt 0.9.

Hospital admissions also dramatically increased positive rate hospital admissions increased roughly 200% overall testing numbers gone down.

As TMC. There's difference many overall tests done many unique people tested. get tested twice week work. mean course year count 100 individual people testing negative. 

That web site provided run random guy Twitter zero history ever providing accurate projection before. reasonable person would consider alone reliable source.

If want look reliable projections saying I'd encourage check article actual valid source looks projections MIT, John Hopkins University, Northeastern, Unviversity Texas, University Mass, etc. show cases biggest frustration that, despite replicable scalable technology right now, us taken pandemic seriously going gaslit 5-10 years future rearview.

Like even though videos woman breaking another woman's leg saying wear mask, politicians air saying old people willing die economy, guy carried supermarket son like baby calls mask wearers ""pussies"", hundreds thousands Facebook posts misinformation...I feel like years, people going act like rare, uncommon occurrences anyone bringing making big deal it. Wait, still talking Ireland here..? Still testing rest world. noticed article date prior change Covid info going White House instead. still believe US honest?

Are honest?

There change sending data White House. change HHS would collect data instead CDC. year USA in? Since ever fully close bet 2030. 
/s  tons friends recovered Covid. healthy functioning adults Covid negative. run around hang large groups, problems visiting friends dinner drinks home mine.  


With said, downplaying Covid way. contrast, many colleagues treated exactly patients, environment, PPE got sick C-19 (confirmed positive) eventually recovered.

If colleagues wearing correct PPE I'd guess got people living with. That's people pick believe. Perhaps living arrangements difference? exactly, they‚Äôre counting deaths people severe illnesses conditions killed covid 19. 

I‚Äôm surprised confusing, we‚Äôre assessing population way they‚Äôre actually accurate way proxy real death rate (you need think task - global scale cannot understated).

Since clearly confusion this, guidelines read straight source instead playing weird game telephone political narrative bias injected in.

Furthermore, death certificates detailed enough accurately include halves+ death clearly see example document. blaming lack granularity reporting entity nothing that. 

Actually, review examples, step ways safeguard you‚Äôre accusing of.

It‚Äôs evident getting news biased source I‚Äôm disappointed incapable fact checking that. Great insight! Thanks taking time explain me. I‚Äôm aerospace budget analyst foreign I‚Äôm glad hear someone else‚Äôs point view closer experience. hope read response learn something well. hope right conclusion extremely rare, alternative (that anyone reinfected period time) would horrifying. People Asia wearing masks regularly decades. Seasonal allergies? Mask. Feeling sick? Mask. Want hide acne break out? Mask. asthma need humid air help breath? Mask. Don‚Äôt like teeth look? Mask. many advantages wearing mask even without covid. studying Japan one teachers wore mask everyday never saw face actually looked like. nobody cared. want wear mask, wear mask. Mask wearing normalized, especially feeling sick. Spreading germs around everyone around inconsiderate. would love everyone public transit wore mask. Every day people crammed train like sardines. someone flu could easily infect least 5 people half hour train ride. There‚Äôs basically downside, reason people something different change scary. That's second study challenged found highly unlikely surfaces viable virus it, unless directly heavily breathed upon sick patient (hospital setting), couple hours.

In reference #7 paper cited above:

"" emphasize none specimens culture positive, indicating possibility identified noninfectious viral genome many, most, cases. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* That's great news.

Stay touch we'll get organised. nothing stop spreading. Masks optional adjustments hvac increase airflow rooms. pretended simply wiping surfaces occasionaly going magically stop virus spreading air. work Target grocery department (not super Target dry goods) change working crazy early morning hours, amount freight needs pushed, rude customers don‚Äôt follow mask social distancing guidelines recent pay cut (they bumped minimum $15/hour July; giving us hazard pay top hourly wage making $15.35/ hour) thoroughly burnt out. wasn‚Äôt full time getting benefits I‚Äôd inclined look another job, still point, everything going instability employment I‚Äôm gonna stick things improve overall coronavirus (I‚Äôm US...so might ugh). exactly.  one would ever even dream taking chance 1% chance death. 

 (not mention much higher percentage around 20% hospitalized, significant chance long term effects, etc). I'm study. Unfortunately, think got placebo. Absolutely reaction injection. I've seen recent study 20% remain asymptomatic, 30% according another. Many mild symptoms never get tested, severe symptoms get tested either (and sometimes die without getting tested). memes even bring worldwide malaria death rates, estimated million year. Like ""See, let poor people Africa die every year, covid big deal"".

I can't even people. Hospitalizations still rising even though cases coming while. means we're finding many positive cases, likely still rising. common widespread, yes exist. Yes, way. voting locked outcome. making bad decisions own, long government steps in. what‚Äôs insane still people northern WI thinking it‚Äôs sort chest cold. Nothing worry about. It‚Äôs mind-blowing. time corona, would rather overload deficiency.   NY efficient providing tests? still suffering massive testing delays like everyone else. still understand value confirming positive providing testing need one rate low.

They forcing people get tests either. could reflection state populations dedication keep spread getting tested exposed. sucks thats another good perspective numbers. also still alive - despite living Covid-19 epicentre. need open drive ins.in parking lots Please link one single ""credible scientific source"" demonstrates fomite transmission. Yes, CDC believed possible. They've gone back forth everything. possible viruses, limited data outset, good advice. *not* tell people wash hands?
 
So far confirmed cases surface transmission. That's Karen Facebook, that's reality. 
 
There Stanford study early showed virus remains stable enough measured laboratory setting time. Measuring existence viable virions lot different demonstrating virions travel surface, onto hand, nose, infect someone. one able show that. Karen, science. Might well make butt plugs goggles mandatory accessory flying. *cAnT cArEfuL nOw!* I‚Äôve wondering incidence unusual symptoms ascribed C19 normal times - i.e. always nobody cared one paying attention? occurring rate C19 common it‚Äôs presumed cause? (I data either way, it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm curious about.) R. E. S. P. E. C. T.


And,... Leadership makes sound decisions based science. many newly infected, death rate may rise. happened South Korea - looked like death rate low week week went patients died. :( Yo dawg, heard like sinks. definitely sounds worse lol. comment solely based study. New Zealand China announced likelihood surface transmission freight sources. no, downvoted stated two numbers (3.5 million 4.5 million) declared 4.5 million right 3.5 million wrong, based evidence. Yeah people effing morons it‚Äôs miracle progressed far species. 

But also goes people sub. top comment ‚Äúsurfaces dangerous!‚Äù know they‚Äôre low risk compared methods. chicken tested positive surface Brazil, point China problem Brazil well? 78% people COVID-19

78% *patients* COVID-19. Please post misleading statements, sub run claim 80% people ever contracted covid permanently damaged. type studies always blame everything lockdowns never calculate hit would virus. nearly good protecting proper medical-grade N95 primarily fitting. probably good mask general, especially close valve tape. Masks work best preventing spreading virus others. OK preventing getting infected. everyone wears mask, that's best situation. mask open valve like defeats main purpose masking. Diluted bleach active day. Heat also makes less active (if leave car used hot water). non splash types sanitizing. Anti mask protest = bad literally killing people selfish. 

Riots protest = constitutionly protected speech studies show spreading virus even though directly correlates thousands deaths giant rise cases country. 

Not mention course coronavirus traces back resturants/bars. People need eat. bet grocery stores hospitals also high rates infected people trace back well. three week wave turn second week assume he's okay think everyone is, least us Nordics. (Denmark here)

I sort pet theory Sweden different self image going back WWII. war, Denmark Norway faced invasion Germany Finland faced two brutal wars survival Soviet Union. Sweden instead got basically untouched neutrals.

I think experience somewhat bred Swedish delusion problems rest Europe. Cold War branded middle way neutral much Nordics.

In handling iimmigration issues see idea handle global challenges without unpleasant things like countries. mentality permeated COVID 19 response 

Like said, pet theory explain seems inexplicable. It‚Äôs almost Americans WANT die also, number people wearing gaiters public place damn high! evidence reinfection far probably say won‚Äôt get reinfected. antibodies doesn‚Äôt mean immunity. Ohhh shit stating facts reddit come vote brigade reddits finnest first foremost thank you. secondly fact accept virus mystery means 85% so-called specialist  tests would mean reduced positivity rate? think people getting back much normal life getting careless. "" ‚ÄúThe point collecting data illuminate, obscure actual facts ground expect fixed shortly,‚Äù said. ""

You mean like calculating Positive Test % differently every state country order lower publicly displayed number? point obscure fact positivity rate twice high?  one saying shelter place indefinitely, get control.

But control, looks control indefinitely. would intense stint months really careful, protracted, science-based opening. 

Bear mind original proposal lockdown couple weeks flatten curve. largely happened. 

The problem curve flattened people figured job done time go back normal, even though virus still much there. 

""Lockdown virus gone"" sustainable plan, ""lockdown forget virus"" also wise plan. 1. Spanish Flu killed much quicker. people who'd wake feeling fine, sniffles breakfast, slight fever noon, end drowning fluids nightfall. Covid takes time kills variety ways, even kill, leaves lasting damage.
2. Spanish Flu numbers educated guesses/ estimates best. way testing many cases/ deaths attributed virus actually were. Today, accurate testing death data rely hard numbers daily damage reports. likely thousands cases misdiagnosed, tested for, never even looked into, deaths.
3. Spanish Flu Pandemic came three waves (some places more, places less) lasted 1918-1921 (worldwide) Covid killing people global scale since February, that's six months ago.
4. estimates 1918 Spanish flu made years, even decades fact retrospective data compile research completed. Covid pandemic still much ongoing likely going full picture years. Inaccurate fear mongering. deaths occur yesterday. far back May! Also, cases US way peak. cases matter much spiking, deaths, deaths cases? Bucket fried chicken social responsibility Actually wasting 20% tests. 

Considering US absolute dumpster fire Rona, everyone one symptom seen positive. want MILD nonexistent symptoms. ones spreading Covid. tell one symptom quarantine. it. Don‚Äòt waste tests ffs. mask advice changed last week - they're recommended now. dude topic - said ‚Äúremove NY NJ super hard hit‚Äù show *when removing hardest hit locations knew fuck it* things empirically worse majority country compared March April. NATIONAL overview higher localized - removing outliers see overall trend US isn‚Äôt looking good going fall/winter anticipating things to...get worse. 

Ugh. agree. think everyone wear mask. everything locked around put lot thought getting groceries whatever needed. parking lot full, went next place. studied articles, read. studied numbers. learned influenced decisions. I'm still expert. kid adult telling nothing worry about, that's big problem. 2 weeks since tested positive. sports program costs absurd, understanding. sure UNL Div-1 University's depending football pay programs understand it. course coaching salaries heading 15-20million total strain especially sports revenue injection. got lucky side effects. [scourge hygiene Even true, extrapolate entire population community even country help whole lot.

Not forget proper hygiene social distancing good measure, naturally. Yes. taped mine. lol probably, mask deniers grasp straw say ""I saw study""

guess what, yalls dumb af, science even want ignore See vaccine works? That's always plan... Reasonable measures implemented responsible threat assessment exactly doing, data available us point say surface contact far less efficient means transmission airborne exposures. 
Treating every conceivable vector primary ever-present threat simply sustainable, consider we're still far likely die car accident, pretty illogical well. Damn.. keep seeing ‚Äúrecord number deaths‚Äù posts every day. It‚Äôs slowing any, it? I‚Äôm fucking tired people. That's true.  thought would wild created country told followers move there, wonder many move  Went grandpa's memorial service recently. ~20 yo kid wore mask said something like ""This mask SHIT.""

I longer sort positive expectations others whatsoever. Yeah breaks quite rapidly. way stabilize using hydrogen peroxide. That's stabilize commercial surface spray.

As municipal water supplies, know. know several Euro nations use it. think moderna one may mine saline really tried giving chance following reasoning...but makes sense. Sorry man. You‚Äôve lost one. probably undetected cases along. horrible attitude. know adequate protection insist using anyway, better dicknosers antimaskers.  final straw hundreds, not, thousands people used plate, cup, utensils........... even though it‚Äôs washed time gets you, fact alone ruins me. trashy family tradition large parts shit hole country fact US flag completely superseded (and consequently rendered irrelevant) Confederate flag many White Southerners seems symbolize cultural divide. hard resolve flag source pride identity people, symbol oppression demons violent past others. impression outside US, feel free add take this. stories heartbreaking. Yeah Phoenix guns everywhere. Shootings probably still table. Oh no, lucky. He'll yuge mouth Fox. Cringe. Exactly strategy, yes. people manipulating results. masks fully protect people COVID-19 help spreading people interacting wearing one. 

The people say work technically correct manipulating data assuming one person wearing mask. state ""testing"" people would like ""well shit work one person wearing one"" think extreme analyze way entirety, people correctly re-examining evolving data points.

New Zealand eliminated disease arrises suspicion virus may spreading Auckland much several weeks. Meanwhile society moved vigilant personal interactions. Infections risen (by 17 far, small number suggesting found) there's renewed concern lockdown duration measures taken.

Sweden slowed infections deaths significantly.

There remains question, realists people knew could answered fully accurately well fact, whether pay piper get chose long. well known people understand industrial hygiene, reason valved respirators without sort filter catch used higher level clean rooms. able watch like 60 hrs/week basketball NBA WNBA (who bubble Bradenton) made feel best months. know raised people, shitty job. Minimal risk. masks worn, much chance spread. least that's leading belief. easily forensic tests identify dead person.

Give take point all. Read article commenting next time. Yeah like personal growth something fear instead something strive them

And shows treatment also delayed due lockdowns though. don‚Äôt disagree need intervene more. 

But full lockdown accomplish little. 

The hospitals see patients. Covid appears subside...elective treatments including cancer screenings delayed...

They kick road feel like. 

New Zealand going new cases 100 days, there‚Äôs clear reason it. 

If it‚Äôs food supply, supposed do? Go without food? Bare shelves stores?

The measure kinda silly. people may immune due previous infection provided antibodies

This slightly incorrect. almost certainly cross reactivity antibodies. meant say cellular immunity like T-cell response cross reactivity previous infections. lot parts US happening places Canada well lived Singapore, Europe, America roughly equal amount years.

My take this:

USA bit third world country Gucci belt, NEARLY much Singapore way treat guest workers, elderly etc. far extreme USA Singapore close slavery situation. Also legal system third-worldly Singapore, although city infrastructure puts USA shame. people‚Äôs mentality Singapore third worldly USA. Things like figuring pull let emergency vehicles traffic good example. rarely happens USA opposite rarely happens Singapore. Internet censorship surveillance also control Singapore, freedom press far worse USA, isn‚Äôt great itself.

USA also shit together much higher degree Southern Europe, much Northern Europe. However, people much altruistic less racist USA Northern Europe. That's probably even worse it?

NGL I'd probably forget put mask back snacking pretty good movie far I‚Äôm aware evidence mask use, even incorrect mask use, associated harm. even hint I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôd hearing since dedicated anti maskers there.

The current understanding transmission comes breathing droplets air. mask mouth nose prevent that. scenario mask contaminated floor infecting someone seems extremely unlikely compared common method breathing droplets. 

Plus, mask mouth nose means can‚Äôt touch them! actually good, even touching mask instead. Masks also serve reminder unconsciously touch face careful general

As risk touching contaminated mask - think way. touch mask mask contaminated get way near someone COVID-19. scenario, know way better mask not. yes, touching mask isn‚Äôt ideal mask contaminated that‚Äôs already exposed mask may prevented inhaling droplets first place invisible threat killed many Americans five months homicides ten years. homicide rate suddenly jumped ~20-30x, people would locking behind closed doors...like now.

Yes! Lets totally ignore happening rest world like USA Brazil, countries thus successful lockdowns like Italy Spain, cherry pick datum suits argument. People die lockdowns, virus! /s

Do sincerely believe countries like Italy would less deaths locked down? WTF? May even higher! 

Example: Sweden 5700 reported COVID deaths deaths ""only"" 4000 deaths average year. reporting covid deaths needed.

Many older would died even get COVID) may considered one describe. family, parents, sister‚Äôs family ‚Äúparties‚Äù. said, exposed other. everyone working, share ‚Äúkid load‚Äù much across 4 kids. 8 people working full-time, isn‚Äôt option unfortunately.

Having ‚Äúparties‚Äù isn‚Äôt really risk point. Mostly it‚Äôs excuse kids keep busy share food together. say, short jobs, nobody list goes out. get deliveries/curb-side pickup. Always wear mask.

There sometimes isn‚Äôt good option. chart lists total positives well. suggest either percent positives total positives remained steady objectively false. fact headline generic nothing comment. stated ‚ÄúThe sad part influenza much worse...‚Äù. piece still stand; however, agree ‚Äúhorrible mismanagement lack education‚Äù contributed failure containing virus. sure Russians multiple teams guys. even Google you.

Even dinner plate touched 4+ different people gets you. could go on.

There thousands ways virus spread restaurant, none spreading food. Like said before, choose go eat, don‚Äôt surprised get sick. Ah, isn‚Äôt good faith argument; you‚Äôre looking excuses shit people.

Enjoy that. guarantee day‚Äôs going fun yours. move 6th? month this, people need able leave homes then. Expecting people sit home 6 months unreasonable, 

We need talking this. can't ask people shelter place indefinitely, we're doing. time goes on, expect protests gain larger momentum.

I expect major protests people completely ignoring CDC recommendations near end summer people try enjoy last bit warm weather. going get really ugly people realize Trick-or-Treat year we'll asking people go visit family Thanksgiving Christmas.

So far, we've called people immortal labeled idiots bad people instead directly addressing concerns, nobody's really changing minds discussion happening. confirm, seeing crazy shit past months location. restaurant industry tough skin already, GYAAAH it‚Äôs gotten bad, keep jobs article literally death rate ny compared early months Spanish flu. want ignore horrible management fed sending old people death camps feel free. 

Now go ahead subtract new york's numbers see difference is. bad place, zero knowledge recommendations made people idea going on. 

Yes flu worse, yes killed people kill people. united States absolute worst possible handling we're even close. Great there's problem currently available solutions work you! there's nothing nuts exploring psychological differences flat screen vr computing. popular IO psychology. nuts wanting maintain distance respiratory pandemic?

While it‚Äôs different type virus, HIV ravaging world decades even money thrown still proven safe effective vaccine approved fda (though trials experimental vaccines exist).

That said, vaccines flu. Since COVID kinda sort-of similar hope. ""And see disinfectant knocks minute. One minute. way something like that, injection inside almost cleaning?

US wearing masks vaccine I'm done place lol True. true covid kills young people fat underlying health conditions? 

Anyone examples healthy, shape young person dying? Using per capita compare testing rates feel disingenuous. US test population around 5 times size, much spread out, fifty different states worth bureaucracies deal with. Could done better, absolutely, act like US done terrible job plain wrong. testing situation order magnitude difficult many countries world. Back again.

Like cat Dreamies. Never goes away.

Nailed every part love.

Now get tea 2 sugars pass dry cleaned coat. really think lockdowns would second order effects? deaths aren‚Äôt negligible normal year, fact increasing much worrying. say coronavirus deaths lag 2 weeks cases, types deaths lag months years lockdown. parents then. Tell sacrifice necessary economy. See goes. Survey = percent reduced interactions 1/4/20-8/2/20 vs  Me? Biology.

Humans great also terrible.

Certain things encourage sociopathic tendencies reducing humans numbers. people rise top since cares anything power.

Public Health England (PHE), Government body charge health research England, coming figures COVID deaths since beginning pandemic. figures news outlets quote, official Government ones include probable cases too, they're known high.

The trouble is, emerged method PHE use bit simplistic. list everyone that's ever got COVID, periodically check see people still alive. they're dead, get marked COVID death. they're alive, don't. cut point, unlike Scotland Northern Ireland cut point 28 days diagnosis.

The obvious flaw method COVID therefore eventually 100% mortality rate. 

The Government called bullshit figures basis could counting people got COVID, recovered discharged, died old age, car crashes, falling ladders, heart failure etc. afterwards.

There big re-count figures make sure everybody dead list actually COVID listed cause death, established 10% list actually killed stuff. would have, China pronounced properly. That's America.  Taking sick days results punishment. Outside long term studies (which obviously can't really since 8 months isnt really long term) fact varying strains covid exactly provide good control confirm (and one going infect group people verify), outright saying different strains covid fabrication ignoring truth matter.

We can't certain affecting infectivity testing (especially early on) difficult fair deny possibility.

Ongoing papers claim varying infectivity: (peer reviewed) One day cure virus, I'm sure ever cure pandemic epidemic taking place multiple continents time. thing local pandemic, global definition. Also, wastewater studies indicate virus least 3 continents late November early December, ridiculous try blame China spreading across world. time first became aware it, world's fate already locked in. Check New Zealand, proper lockdown works. may true UK, can‚Äôt assume true U.S. 50 million infections, would make death rate ~.4% using excess deaths, way low comparison know countries. tips way down. People afford $110/hr massage can't afford extra gratuity. ??? pointing claims confirmed cases aided testing, ""amount testing skew confirmed cases.""

Now, opposite ""amount test absolutely skews confirmed cases!"" [Shock think second quote probably based John Kenneth modern conservative engaged one man's oldest exercises moral philosophy; is, search superior moral justification selfishness. think might hit head baseball played. Probably intentionally. Media rarely reported message Maria started definition war. misinformation borderline fabrication since naturally, can't track random sample size people across 10-15 year period evaluate health function able separate COVID's impact long-term health function factors like lifestyle choices make along way.

We also can't baseline health function prior coming COVID. 

EG, obese, 48 year old smoker gets COVID kicks ass. suffer reduced lung function recover. much COVID much lifestyle? start measure reasonably young, healthy people get whatever reason, kicks ass hard - study time.

What can't say 50% people get suffering long-term flat lie based science could possibly know point. kids. Give mask least. fact think leading question indicates believe would wrong say ""yes"". good news indeed. bodes well vaccines well! Someone corrected bit. misremembering anecdote applies 8,000 members British Association Physicians Indian Origin.

Just looking England 49k, compared PHE figure 41k.

Still bad least fair comparisons. issue 65k excess deaths figure title, whole UK England, think figure England closer 55k. I've looking info while.

Thank NYT. 

Ignoring case looking total deaths comparing past years likely safest way understand effects lock downs preventative measures.

We probably reliable testing information next 6-12 months current president want best case Biden elected might able get ahead problem sometime next year. Someone lot unsynced light bulbs. Since start July, approximately 580-ish. 60-ish cases total months combined July.

## Abstract

Combinations intense non-pharmaceutical interventions (lockdowns) introduced worldwide reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Many governments begun implement exit strategies relax restrictions attempting control risk surge cases. Mathematical modelling played central role guiding interventions, challenge designing optimal exit strategies face ongoing transmission unprecedented. Here, report discussions Isaac Newton Institute ‚ÄòModels exit strategy‚Äô workshop (11‚Äì15 May 2020). diverse community modellers providing evidence governments worldwide asked identify main questions that, answered, would allow accurate predictions effects different exit strategies. Based questions, propose roadmap facilitate development reliable models guide exit strategies. roadmap requires global collaborative effort scientific community policymakers, three parts: (i) improve estimation key epidemiological parameters; (ii) understand sources heterogeneity populations; (iii) focus requirements data collection, particularly low-to-middle-income countries. provide important information planning exit strategies balance socio-economic benefits public health. ever seen smoker nic-fit before?
Get small group set‚Äôem loose, instant anarchy lol  thought Big 12 announcement yesterday? headline read said they're going play. 

Dumbest decision ever. kill them, might screw rest lives. whole plan going college stepping stone NFL/NBA ruined might actually learn something.

This country bassackwards stupid burns. referring Expanding Florida helps spread pandemic. confirm. Work hospital. lady work with, daughter exposed positive case daycare. tested (took 7 days come back). daughter fevers. since exposer unconfirmed case told could come back work would even test her... like wtf. Thankfully boss isn‚Äôt idiot gave days off. daughter negative. course worry accuracy it‚Äôs weeks nobody gotten sick yet. So, frogs smarter people Florida. important weigh costs shutting disrupting society costs C-19 itself.

If consider excess deaths C-19 deaths, answer seems clear. Shut down! instead separate compare different countries‚Äô strategies went, answer less clear woiuld think people would far viglent years, another outbreak came along, would need shutdowns, would tested, isolated infected people, cut knees, could spread. reacted way, first case showed January, West coast, might even now. makes far sense. half roughly 8,000 new cases tallied daily update tests taken long seven weeks ago. 

Just thought I'd point out, everyone claims he's hiding cases, glitch caused numbers HIGHER be, lower. right. takes enough people following rules drag out. Seen first hand already Jobs going back office. work home could juggle it. Also job willing make exceptions work around months, year, much never said ""intentionally."" fact, LEAKED implies accident, intent. 

But would mess accidenly leak virus? Yes - would.

How know? leaked SARS-1 before. like covid directly tied health something.. Weird. Management bunch greedy cowards murderers suffer consequences. Don‚Äôt even guts speak tragic lack humanity good judgement. Difficult decision &amp; something lot companies think going flu season. us, now, assume every symptom covid; track &amp; trace QT. reasonable IMO fewer 1 10 actually COVID. IMO best practice rapid onsite testing PCR confirmation. React Rapid test awaiting PCR confirmation. PCR overrule rapid test, vice versa Really? I'm ginger VIT deficiency. Epidemiologist Adam Kucharski joins TWiV discuss SARS-CoV-2, including R0, incubation period, herd immunity, asymptomatic infection, superspreaders, children drivers pandemics, one end. Lolol imagine believing facts Or, could read article. growth rate slowing though right? someone explain like I'm 5? bout struggle hands slightly sweaty maybe 100% dry washing impossible put glove weeds lol people already forgotten!  Remember, Florida, choice ballot getting punched throat getting million bucks, vote would 50.1% 49.9%. !remindme English meh language two main anglo speaking countries probably wont survive decade anyways... Well considering every country world form mass unmasked(when masked constantly pulling chin social distancing, might well masked) gathering every day ‚Äúpressing reason politically‚Äù don‚Äôt think stop seeing things. It‚Äôs many people. Science ""bipolar fuck"" said. method it, madness. say shit like this, right now. I‚Äôm putting 2 cents like everyone else, isn‚Äôt makes US great? think testing obviously better, say completely failing tests little disingenuous think movie pirating bad wait till see people get perfect copy theater movies instantly. USA! USA! USA! Glad dropped, still high. cases lifelong lasting effects even rarer.

Do mean flu Covid case? latter, know? enough data.

It better overcautious dismiss things hand. ""emotional"", smart.

A *lot* people recovered still exhibit symptoms, large proportion cases show signs vascular damage months after.

It's ""we're fucked/we're fine"" situation. important simplistic view things, unfortunately appears advocating.

Risk management means sometimes need show abundance caution. We're seeing high death toll, difficult recovery potential long-time effects, *with* extraordinary measures. Please downplay disease.  never view neighbors way. friends family may feel way about. unfortunate eye opener.

You better person I. Instead feeling unsure, I've outright permanently blacklisted/cancelled several friends even family members. even make eye contact neighbors now. place selfish creatures like life. Soulless gingers stealing vitamin Oh know, government fucked big time. hope guys start slow you‚Äôll us. end peak unless second wave hits. absolutely right man. I‚Äôm awful awful father don‚Äôt ask oncologist works cited every conversation, procedure visit. Working pediatric cancer patients sort assumed would know infection control trolls Reddit I‚Äôm obviously wrong. live near Durham? maybe come father obviously superior every way.

You go right everything I‚Äôll go endangering son‚Äôs life listening medical advice oncologists. agree hurt. long people sanitize shopping, wash up\sanitize putting stuff away nothing worry about.  think thought less antibody-immunity, instead T-cell immunity/resistance. article linked behind paywall. Anyone deets? clean veggies diluted hydrogen peroxide. course, use soap hard skinned items like apples.  I'm college ATM, living parents, reason go out. would thought place nobody wears mask drinking eating, talking spreading spit since drunk, high concentration people could increase COVID 19 cases? Idk. circumstances, coach's job (especially south) tied well team given year. Considering many jobs switch HS coaching job pays (the skill sets non-transferrable), coach could worried ability feed family too.

This sucks over. wise man said, ""It is.""

Oh, edit: barely consider Harleys motorcycles. There's reason they're called ""ass jewelry."" people ride actual good motorcycles, respect. yet meet Harley rider poser. I'm sure exist, hide well. USC researchers found likely order COVID-19 symptoms first appear: fever, cough, muscle pain, nausea, and/or vomiting, diarrhea.


Knowing order COVID-19's symptoms may help patients seek care promptly decide sooner later self-isolate, scientists say. also may help doctors rule illnesses, according study led doctoral candidate Joseph Larsen colleagues faculty advisors Peter Kuhn James Hicks USC Michelson Center Convergent Bioscience's Convergent Science Institute Cancer.


Recognizing order symptoms also could help doctors plan treat patients, perhaps intervene earlier disease.


""This order especially important know overlapping cycles illnesses like flu coincide infections COVID-19,"" said Kuhn, USC professor medicine, biomedical engineering, aerospace mechanical engineering. ""Doctors determine steps take care patient, may prevent patient's condition worsening.""


""Given better approaches treatments COVID-19, identifying patients earlier could reduce hospitalization time,"" said Larsen, study's lead author.


Fever cough frequently associated variety respiratory illnesses, including Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). timing symptoms upper lower gastrointestinal tract set COVID-19 apart.


""The upper GI tract (i.e., nausea/vomiting) seems affected lower GI tract (i.e., diarrhea) COVID-19, opposite MERS SARS,"" scientists wrote.


The authors predicted order symptoms spring rates symptom incidence 55,000 confirmed coronavirus cases China, collected Feb. 16-Feb. 24, 2020, World Health Organization. also studied dataset nearly 1,100 cases collected Dec. 11, 2019 Jan. 29, 2020, China Medical Treatment Expert Group via National Health Commission China.


To compare order COVID-19 symptoms influenza, researchers examined data 2,470 cases North America, Europe Southern Hemisphere, reported health authorities 1994 1998.


The scientific findings published Thursday journal¬†Frontiers Public Health.


""The order symptoms matter. Knowing illness progresses differently means doctors identify sooner whether someone likely COVID-19, another illness, help make better treatment decisions,"" Larsen, lead author, said. New PCR positive rate dropped 13.9 13.8% technical analysis say's graph going higher can, nearly good gym. cool!!! Mine never closed. TNFSF14 recogznied herpesvirus entry mediator. recognized mean context? herpes make asymptomatic covid? knew it! Big brain may accidentally unblinded father lol. ill night getting it, feels great now.

explain Yeah 0.3% people may die even get it. Lol ok read it. said influenza much worse. mean, bad, *shut society* bad? I'd say no. traced people 35 people might infected? First time life I've reached date changing oil milage, way COVID. misrepresentation deaths:
 No, new hospitalizations actually down. Okay US change sniffles, amirite? /s influenza cause heart neurological damage lung scarring mild cases? way influenza worse covid-19. Havent (USA) Blown past scale already? suffered since supermarkets available fill every gluttonous desire. great great grandparents worked farms 1910s/1920s, like many Americans (higher percentage now) shit soda, iced cappuccinos, cake, etc non existent, huge sources weight gain. People drank boiled water tea alcohol (if could get it), food grown, worked 14 hour days often get it. say Great Depression hit rural areas 10 years earlier people like grandfather remember growing rural area living solely beans, potatoes, venison, squirrel, lucky piece bread. malnourished weight til joined Navy 16 (lied age).

Obesity largely symptom abundance. Poor asian African nations suffer much. Thanks! talked dentist giving people buzzers (like restaurant) people wait cars. subs toxic ways times... Yes, understand exponential growth works. exponential rate decrease 8 6 still exponential, schools openings give boost right back natural R_0. real precautions Texas imperfect mask usage. Case numbers cooked. I've mostly chatting colleagues Texas fwiw. They've real ICU beds since mid June. Ooh death reports Texas 12 weeks lag system overwhelmed.

To make situation seem less bad providers, Texas hospitals sending sickest covid people home die admitting them. means pt's family gets too. spread lethal strains community.

I data engineer, albeit working NYC NYS hospitals. fine preparing second wave travel. Oh ask local ER docs nationwide ICU medication shortages ;) *He think there's hard threshold 20%* 

Right, that's I'm saying Ok, I'll give that. However, unless quote entire article, anything potentially context.

The headline state 6% people studied coronavirus. extrapolate state 3.4 million people coronavirus. Qualifying ""Major Antibody Study Finds"" negate subsequent words. use word 'had' makes statement.

The first paragraph essentially states, without intermediate distractions, ""Around 3.4 million people England contracted coronavirus, major antibody study found"". state extrapolation fact. make statement, even qualification, tested 56 million people.

For example, go party 100 people (after lockdown) speak 10 people, confirm also speak French. would report 100 people spoke French, would lie. report 100% people asked spoke French. could add would tend suggest people party spoke French. However, could state ""All 100 people party spoke French, findings"", would factually incorrect.

These click-bait headlines sadly norm days.

Finally, large survey is, still 1 every 560 people England. 63% British adults overweight already calorie information food supermarkets, change little people eating disorder probably eating anyway. Yet salon California closed half year despite going beyond CDC guidelines 1600 hours sanitation training. 
... yeah, drinking eating without mask totally allowed. movie theaters going new Myrtle Beach spreading virus? happens time Schools open, bets off? Wow, TX numbers crazy. Dropping 60k-80k tests day 10k-15k next week. way look think people deciding get tested. coming top try make people think everything A-OK. IIRC, Dr. Fauci even wipe groceries. leaves alone 24 hours. know four people coronavirus, minor symptoms fine week later. mean overall risk virus different scientists reporting one dies? course not. Anecdotal evidence isn‚Äôt helpful. wash hands sure. stuff mad overkill. Especially bottom shoes bit. virus happy ending, get yours, too. know many people ride motorcycles, especially Harley's. Pretty ignorant generalize large group people I'm movie buff , I'd often go movies jsut enjoy opening weekend movies stepping theater 2021 , guaranteed.  don‚Äôt know much community tracing admitting hospital treating worst it. patients last week family get togethers friends including kids. even noted kid two sinus ‚Äúproblems.‚Äù willful ignorance virus affects people. I‚Äôm dreading far I‚Äôve able avoid guilt tripping family visiting, come holidays? Gonna rough. So, we're talking fairytale world? least bars restaurants they're wiping stuff staff mostly ask people put masks they're mingling. alternative giant house parties zero wiping single mask. ventalation, spread factor? would tested someone pneumonia. girlfriend's grandma passed away back April double pneumonia, hospital administered 4 tests covid there. came back negative, mold caused it. Sure, [this Like high-risk professions (i.e. ICU nurse), risk definitely mitigated PPE conscientious precautions. took kids cleanings May dentist's office re-opened loads measures implemented. receptionist lobby behind plexiglass. Masks required. Children parents temperatures checked (contactless) entering dental area. dentist PPE head toe, looked like hospital worker. feel you. mom wants help school come start next weeks feel bad say don‚Äôt think could live daughter inadvertently got killed.
This sucks feel everyone everywhere strong need continue find way shit storm. Apparently you‚Äôre Democrat I‚Äôve work shit. yep doctors get shit wrong Nobody can. nobody guarantee family die old age end pandemic.

Pick poison. Oh, remarking antibodies thing? Yeah, definitely. even debated science nowadays. Absolutely. He's professor infectious diseases he's also Standing Committee Emerging Infectious Diseases 21st Century Health Threats National Academies Science, Engineering, Medicine. guarantee he's right he's certainly study youre alluding wrt covid living surfaces used absurdly high concentration virus -- need something like twenty covid positive people sneeze exactly spot replicate study. *Most city hospitals half empty*

It depends city. restaurant, front house, employee, attest fact, least Pennsylvania, people acting like nothing going all. Granted, that‚Äôs idea, outdoor seating always full, spaced 6 feet apart, even indoor 25% occupancy, still tell people wear masks can‚Äôt put tables closer. groups friends go together sit together aren‚Äôt wearing masks go home families. It‚Äôs mind blowing. wear mask 13 hours day sometimes wash hands hundred times day dickheads can‚Äôt wear mask table bathroom. offering 15 cent tickets right now. Set clock it‚Äôs 1/1000! mean, flu exactly thing? people get hit, don't. Note range. think there's hard threshold 20%. 600K dead Americans 35% existing restrictions held place. exactly enticing option supportive ""worst over"" approach. Yes. comparing mortality rates, death toll. Nah, cook well. Besides, ya gonna eat popcorn? /s shit ain't worth defending. actually read article? Exponential growth. Imagine getting infected 2 cells first compared 20 cells. larger initial dose virus harder body's defenses keep compared lower initial exposure. They‚Äôll definitely audience. large percentage population believes virus hoax, like flu, children almost immune, HCQ cure, etc. people totally go see movies. household mom. got ridiculously sick never caught it. Wild wild beast corona is. Surfaces transmission vector. told 3 days metal/plastic, 1 day cardboard.

Those findings since challenged: various studies found virus could survive surfaces days used impossibly high concentrations virus. Studies attempted mimic real-world conditions able find viable viruses surfaces, researcher believes 1-2 hours, highly unlikely surface still active viruses. idea though cuts idea infectious disease though right? virions isnt enough get average joe well truly sick contagious themselves, much virions really predict horrendously sick person produce spread? lot comes dose. exposed million times less virus, 20 doubling periods catch up. know virus' doubling time body, give immune system hour days time respond. Good. Well might think still useful office. commenting phrasing used threadstarter: ""any excess body mass contributes higher BP additional strain cardiovascular system heart lungs"".

This common misconception emphasis MIS Oh god. made actually lol. Thank you. Nope moderna saline, read informed consent sheet specifically asked want something worry otherwise life pointless. Pssst 4 now. Give 2 weeks. gains made Lincoln mask mandate. one Omaha put going go shit mean, anyone expect otherwise? (any-a lot) uncontrolled traffic normal times. people may get arrested sneaking Canada don‚Äôt think getting shot at. admit I‚Äôm current relation ship them. Funny there‚Äôs thing don‚Äôt it, can‚Äôt spread it. someone else doesn‚Äôt it, guess what, can‚Äôt get either. Enjoy hiding apartment cats. always say smart enough know I‚Äôm smart enough. many need sacrifice understand.. virus mostly spread air via respiratory droplets. Food airborne virus (lol). cook sneezing scenario, take-out customer breathing air hours end employee in-person diner would. 

Any surface formites, extent issue, dealt reheating food oven get home. ""If people suffering, supposed know succeeding life?"" donald doesn‚Äôt know big words like banish deserted; dessert, however‚Ä¶ Yeah mean whats chances happening virus flu like symptoms, mostly kills people superannuated age co-morbidities whose therapeutics still testing stages, oh lab confirmed pcr test required stating death covid 19 oh yeah financial incentives table covid 19 confirmed....what chances....? 60% I'd say. maybe 70 100% are, read damn informed consent sheet. join trial myself, thanks O- blood, donated blood recently.

It‚Äôs 100% saline can‚Äôt lie that. Ooh haha gotcha. done nothing options. Hosts organizers responsible. inviting come. victims.  guess place kids parents acting like them. Ignorance amazing form takes. I've opted leather bag approach getting vitamin  Hence said ""room temperature stable"". bag flour? Safe room temperature. Milk? Wipe carton disinfectant put fridge. Lowest would probably around 400$ standalone one. highly urge everyone what's right family find ways interact. say am, moment, entering information states system family tested positive get together last week. takes one instance. Assault legally requires victim experience fear immediate harm unconsented touching. Battery unconsented physical touching. Treatment options available today exist back 1918. Consider past could delivered oxygen implement basic modern treatment protocols, add potential reality likely halved CFR course outbreak aswell. advancements may reduced number potential deaths 75%.

Now factor countries world able get ready COVID-19, back 1918 likely started reacting first wave well underway, less likely vigilant second wave aswell. also understanding prevent reduce severity initial infections aswell will, least, reduce severity outcomes.

So never get perfect comparison 2 outbreaks. seem like COVID-19 affects older demographics aggressively, Spanish Flu may affected younger demographics heavily COVID-19 does.

In end, think verdict still there, especially considering even touched upon contagiousness COVID-19, accounts surpasses even Spanish Flu. Hopefully fades obscurity. Go spread virus, rational big boy! think old antibody test really bad Here's good article Johns Hopkins Covids effect kidneys. 

TLDR-- article never mentions covid causing infection kidneys. problem function kidney. Covid attaching cells kidney, low O2 levels, cytokine storms, blood clots contribute malfunction Antimaskers: ""Live free die....""

Us: Ok then, die! 

Unfortunately them. would good get rid them, country would much better place. problem MURDERING innocent people. take someone susceptible strokes, give cornavirus, disease attacks cells blood vessels known cause strokes yeah, asking fatal stroke. typically considered lung infection, COVID-19 found cause blood clots lead severe stroke.

SO yes, coronavirus probably killed person. higher fitness seem counter cardiometabolic effects fat mass, certainly still subject arthrosis lower body. less wearing surgical mask without another mask it. They‚Äôve caught Canada (population 37,000,000). Well done.  Math closely related science believe it. kinda got Judge Dredd.. give time rest dystopias come. carry spray bottle diluted bleach. get gas week spray handle down. Fun fact: Battle Royale came first really hope god so. think rollout going pretty quick. Like realistically. USA global epicenter shit, I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôre going rush ass off. Around corner:

The short list: Sturgis concludes Sunday 10 days, another motorcycle rally occurs NH 8/22-8/30, schools opening w/o meeting benchmarks, testing certain highly infected states reducing testing percentages 50% (to make appear infections going open schools), flu season right around corner last, least, Labor Day 3 weeks away. 

Oh, boy. That's elite tier private ones now. 

The elephant room large top--tier public universities. information schools, much problematic campus size. gonna go using mugshot like photo black man victim. nope, 47yo woman. 

I accidentally reverse UNO carded prejudice. sure would agree reading resent reports basic basic CDC inability use software order track virus first month. know one keep job preformed badly? probably part test. mailed finger prick tests loads people. Really well put together, model distributed testing say. managed get blood everywhere though that's muppet. FB friend posted called ‚ÄúWhite Paper‚Äù HQLN written one quack Frontline doctors (see link below). accuses others relying ‚Äúappeals authority hominem‚Äù arguments ironically uncritically shares article written one fake doctors. 

It‚Äôs annoying. wonder making money pushing drug use disposable gloves. prefer wash hands soap water available, hand sanitizer. know protect virus, also protect planet unnecessary extra pollution. say none contracted it, know? High probability asymptomatic infection among young people tests high false negative rates. Unless got tested several times high blood draw antibody test, way knowing. May recommend general strike. time. Race economics tied pretty tight places like USA. Love thy self, suffer ire. China good blaming others bad hygiene practices poorly regulated food supply never recovered destroyed civil war. Everything followed symptom collective inability accept move beyond defeat. Jesus, Chili's. Fuck people. Anecdotally, I'm big milk drinker, fair spend much time uncovered sun. found severe Vit deficiency 4 years ago. 

I used get *frequent* upper respiratory infections, least 5-6 times per year. Since started taking daily vitamin recall sick once. There's ton promising news vaccines novel therapeutics lately. good news repurposed existing drugs. think things going start improving rapidly towards winter 2020 continue improve 2021.

I also think mask use social distancing plus vaccine use give us one tamest flu seasons ever. 

Only widespread earth half year. science accomplished remarkable. Yea I'm getting retest say? Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha ‚Äúlook right everyone‚Äù. Kick rocks kid depend body what's going too. Since I've combo meds years new one I've added vit D, easy tell cause sudden upswing energy/uplifted mood. getting things balanced super tricky act things play nice right away. (The first six months iron pills [I'm severely anemic], iron levels actually got MUCH WORSE got better. awful.)

At least, getting vit levels good you. &lt;3 hope goes health! Vietnam similar thing land border China, small countries keep things contained wearing old man underwear? underrated explanation. 

Everything politics table manners mimic taste landed aristocrats. Vendee US.  you? Yesterday deadliest day. Deaths going spikes normal part that. boyfriend guy 45 mins hour check AC, wearing masks since boyfriend hasn‚Äôt wearing mask areas. talked quite bit. Windows weren‚Äôt open.

What‚Äôs risk level that?

Edit- What‚Äôs downvotes questions? could anyone possibly offended this? I'd punctuate make sense:

""Now, police Middletown working law enforcement officials New York positively identify couple, suspected 20‚Äôs 30‚Äôs, based license plate number captured scene.""

So working identify based plate, suspect ages 20s 30s absence additional information. Haha commented wrong comment. Sorry that! Idk managed that. 

Someone‚Äôs colleague went work able taste smell didn‚Äôt know common symptom. Soecifically New York. places affected like New York. really valid point compare everywhere. didn‚Äôt teachers school faculty went training Navy Seals.

It‚Äôs racist scapegoats entire ethnicity failures government. Could lot worse.  least won‚Äôt able taste popcorn. think we're describing thing different ways.

But really turns on, Attorney office back Chinese dry cleaners.

The person racist interpretation you. Evaluate why. think delay results probably culpable. There's point getting tested know results come three weeks later. This. Schools, sports, companies taking lot supply chain resources. Even lab (like NBA/NFL) still need reagents, swabs, etc. fears irrational, maliciously downplaying it.

From I‚Äôve reading longer severe PPE shortages, places excess capacity - even south. Questioning you‚Äôre still pressuring sick providers back care without PPE.

I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs completely understandable guys wife depression issues, it‚Äôs bit fucked immediately associate seeing loved family members (which done socially distanced manner) everyone getting COVID going ICU  fairy tale world mean nation except USA, especially new Zealand, sure, fairy tale world. Temporary mask orders past lead kind permanent orders. conspiracy theory gives ignorant people excuse continue live denial. maybe, maybe, humans social creatures need interactions keep sane functioning keep seeing repeated it‚Äôs true. It‚Äôs weird myth like ‚ÄúI saw orange acid‚Äù thing see devil horns pos forehead. We're still missing part explanation people got 1918, die rate?

Pick 1970 instance (random year), explain children contracted H1N1 die rate children 1918?  hated lot growing small town Juggalos acted white supremacist gang. music also incredibly homophobic time (which regret).

Of course, lot white supremacy home town general, eventually learned views universal. like kids, school either hated teachers thought little them

I think might changing least little bit COVID apocalypse. 11-year-old niece seem enthusiastic school, started crying learned teacher write living school year. Even children understand gravity teachers forced do. Ebola weak sauce, barely killed 20,000. Obviously less deadly 1918 flu. Solid reason treat people like shit took days pretend clean surfaces even though evidence transmitted air. thought prayed. Well, lets see happens two weeks. Heat inclement weather much south. It‚Äôs dangerous take old people babies long, utilities high time. It‚Äôs honestly inclement weather patterns, really minds. Exactly. Unless youre complete hermit i'd imagine everybody come contact viral fragments Actually it‚Äôs bit complicated that. 

Covid heart lung damage even asymptomatic people. could correlation Covid damage organs caused failure, leading car crash. happens fairly often car crashes one car involved, persons underlying condition caused lose control, pass etc. You‚Äôd need autopsy body intact enough know stuff. 

Or crash could drunk driver killing them. 
What im saying is, it‚Äôs complicated that‚Äôs 100% covid related. like excess deaths stat cause that‚Äôs dead bodies. year priors... kinda speaks  Okay. like said, I‚Äôm data scientist. took basic econometrics math associated it, go know. family friends high healthcare ladder, little insight local ICU bed situation overall climate current situation. agree you. It‚Äôs wild fire. 

But ICU beds filled according inaccurate data well anecdotal experiences I‚Äôm told about, won‚Äôt be. Yes data bias generalizing ICU beds filled cases going continue grow increasing rates also isn‚Äôt entirely true. Military members: ‚Äúyou guys treated like humans? apply strawberry blondes ginger beards like ? still soul but... China running United States? No? China responsible failures. Period. european countries. Ireland new cases 5 per day weeks eased lockdown measures started reopening businesses etc. ease measures naturally get increase cases again. trick slowly carefully spikes easily identified, traced isolated. Three counties ireland returned lockdown serious spikes (over 100 cases one area). Schools return 2 weeks, real test we're doing. Vitamin doesn‚Äôt make lot sense consider outbreaks southern sunny US cities like Houston Miami. much Texas explained rapid results tests counted state numbers? UgH nickel every time... Nice article. No. time. 

I'm English gentleman.

One night sex one, finished her. popped straight round ones house asked out, sex her. evening. going steady different times. One possible explanation different viral dosage different strains. people exposed virus greater amount intake/dosage, people might exposed strain mutated acquired higher potency transmission (D614G mutation, example).

But said true, know little virus. don‚Äôt know jumped, originated, long transmitting found it, many evolutionary events went etc

We need comprehensive testings study. anything pandemic revealed fragile society really is, studying help us prepare better next - next, unfortunately. Yeah questions. OHHH, unblinded knows got vaccine placebo.

I'm pretty sure people interpreting literally blind vaccine curing him. Magic Johnson seems fine üôÑ Oh sure. That's recommended late morning early evening. 10 o'clock sun definitely burn depending season, get solid dose UVs without extreme aspect cause skin cancer.

I think balance. Wearing shirt sunscreening face back neck, leaving hands arms hour (depending direct exposure) would great amount sun someone fair skinned wants conscious UV exposure.

Or delaying reapplication sunscreen every 3 hours instead two get UV between. ""This Fall 'Worst' We've Seen"" 


FTFY  Technically, *is* SARS. strain, sure, full name COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2. 

SARS-CoV-1 SARS. That‚Äôs ‚Äúprojection‚Äù part GO**P** think brain surgeon pudding pops guy  willfully ignorant someone understand basic symptoms control pandemic effects us all?

I understand many people absolutley sense self preservation. contact tracer needs contact 3 people per day? Thats lot. three months lockdowns prevented many people accessing treatments non-COVID infectious diseases;

Lockdowns fueling this, covid No, true schools, especially public institutions. Salaries (and benefits, mainly health care) far largest component budget, relatively even. highest paid administrator university makes $360,000, professors make 70,000 120,000. Deans make around 200k. Compared ratio CEO American companies, that's peanuts. Lowering salaries administrators (and coaches!) would help, lower tuition much. many reports coming COVID19 may provide long lasting symptoms something similar CFS Chronic Fatigue Syndrome many thought asymptomatic. mean one indoor setting *required* least periodically remove mask order eat drink place coronavirus likely spread? stunning revelation! -45% testing TX 19% positivity.

I work free site Houston. one showing up. went 100/hr 100/day. least that's somewhat credible source quack blog post. However, AAPS reliable considered ultra right wing anti-government. Understandably, change people's opinion it. instead look sources. referenced saying masks help April. Well, updated recommendations June encourage mask wearing. would pick apart sources saying AAPS good source sufficient. 

It tough often moot discussion though. dont back appication savings, get visa says work freelancer ""teach english"" freelancer anything require special license like welding, professional translations, electrician stuff like this. GF got took TEFL course based got freelance license teaching. report earnings pay social health payments (altogether approx 150usd/month) good go. get full health insurance paying retirement/unemployment already. questions, let know, firends business get VISA americans CZ. me, thee

American government concrete data effective vaccines while. also take quite get enough population vaccinated. around maybe vaccine work. Happens vaccines, herd immunity Also, social acceptability. one supermarket know got early vaccine, see maskless person assume bad person. Or, worse, think Ok stop wearing one too. fly person. Dummy. least one identified cases someone failed wait results going school (the one got identified positive day 1. That's plain stupidity cuz they've created domino screened and/or quarantined. sure cases Things shut down. Nebraska. believe anything football around (I wish less true). Thought cancelling Husker football would knocked sense people. common sense seems curse. think one world pleased things going got one doctors giving hydroxychloroquine patients die make trump look bad sad.

why fuck want butcher people make trump look bad?  Honestly believe freedom information need start punishing people spreading medical disinformation selling dangerous ailments causes bodily harm people. College football likely canceled. Don‚Äôt Cough Me! üêç CIA?

I idea CIA know know. CIA kind dirt countries may use variety ways. 


CIA finding something mean immediate release info publicly. See. Trump bringing jobs America!!; Deadliest day summer *so far*. Yes do! Woopsie doodle. Exactly! nothing Republicans rubbing alcohol spray bottle use. 91% like bunch Russian bots. Wait til Donny gets sentenced. No, virus supposed last surfaces long. Sure would shame someone sunk yachts People said stupid bullshit like egocentric never read anything happening countries. It‚Äòs quickly process samples. It‚Äôs many samples process day.

5,000 samples day 3.5/minute(And actually think 5,000 samples/day breaks sweat machinery, uses PCR, laboratory grade

One fastest commercial machines seen 15 minutes Per test. Let‚Äòs say buy 15 those(I guess would cost atrocious amount money) able efficiency 1/minute lot manual labor involved.

Edit: simple pub math laboratory machinery

Let‚Äòs say 20 testing sites, testing 250 people/day. 5,000 tests ready what, 10pm? 

You drop laboratory processed next day - maybe start process evening/at night measurements done next day morning/midday. test results noon. Send testing sites/health officials. 2 days. 3 days ones contacting tested people manually. comes biological threats, smallest mistake make huge difference. Remember covid binary (not getting severity right now). like bundling cold tiny gap means little cooler. means exposed contract disease. simple habit scratching nose thinking could well enough cause problems. 

Additionally, even properly fitted, masks respirators always 100% effective unless talking nice PAPR respirators. experience fit tester half full face respirators U.S. Navy, would surprised much pepper smoke leak even smallest gap poor seal due facial hair.

Walking around, vast majority people wearing masks properly, likely comfortable wrong. really. vitamin C, piss extra. 

But anyway, fact VitD OD'd reason give false, exaggerated information benefits. Say ""USA!"" loud several times. 

Semantic satiation kicks devolves ""You're slave!"" Yep. think saw somewhere another really big thing going on, can't remember. 

'Murica.  would say 100% contact looks photo. Idaho one highest covid rates nation, so... get control

When exactly that? number get too, goalpost us reach for. 'under control'. NZ multiple cases slip locked again. completely unreasonable. Unreasonable. Forgive ignorance, vaccine supposed protect Individual, worry people don‚Äôt want take it? I‚Äôm asking vaxx anti vaxx standpoint curious guys bringing tragedies it'll fall deaf ears economy people. 9/11 saw destruction tallest skyscraper New York. Titanic largest ship time sinking.

People care loss life, cared loss property. reason people freaked riots disease killed hundreds thousands people. working self-isolation home since March 14th, result cooking meals instead eating restaurants, used two even three times day pre-pandemic. even done drive-thru take-out.

I shop groceries online back car loaded Wal-Mart without ever setting foot grocery store (so exposure sales promotion junk food store). TV died early pandemic, exposure TV commercials food, either. (I become Netflix binge-watcher.)

I credit zero junk food (I buy chocolate, ice cream, potato chips popcorn shop groceries online) almost zero restaurant meals (3 visits 4 months) losing noticeable amount weight since March 14th.

I know exactly much I've lost, since stepped scale, older, smaller belt able wear YEARS. best guess, I've lost around 15-20 pounds far, felt deprived hungry all.

It's one good thing, one unexpected benefit, come goddamn pandemic. bemused need lose weight, I'll take it, thankyouverymuch! literally benefit hotel vs quarantining home. gamer, good luck gaming shitty internet.

The people force homes quarantine, disincentivize getting tested. 

If drag family quarantine, enemy. 

And I‚Äôm actually sick, intentionally cough you. It‚Äôs least go. 

And you‚Äôre lucky don‚Äôt gun...

The reason hospitalized severe symptoms. 1. Spanish flu numbers estimated way fact, ""this many deaths US today"" headlines.

2. Spanish Flu lasted year.

3. vaccine Spanish Flu.

4. Virology come long way since SF, initially clue causing it. initially identified ""filter passing virus"" time.

These add conclusions:
1. started, knows future holds. Dismissing current threat something might worse foolish. know someday scaling numbers, point makes sense compare two.

2. knowledge transmission, contact tracing, sharing information huge advantage around 1910s. perspective, TV invented, first coast coast telephone call made 1915, efficient way travel train boat. come long way technology/information sharing perspective.

3. many peoples lives saved technology like ventilators, plasma transplants like?

4. Pandemic allowed stay course (assuming viable vaccine created), compare two? Covid deadlier not? I'm sure data modelers field day playing decades.

Some things actually benefit society pandemic, travel taking longer airplane significantly limits fast spread. Giving people info boon curse depending information listening to. sure helps reservations not.  like look testing statistics, obviously. lost cause. Get bent. funny thing absolutely zero reason think increased voting mail would disadvantage Trump ‚Äî studies shown partisan bias either direction, one Trump's insane, senile conspiracies ‚Äî whereas fucking economy even already *definitely* hurt him.  likely: herd immunity causing massive drop cases areas hardest hit March/April/May suddenly everyone Northeast 100% mask compliance?

Do masks help? course. causing drop cases seeing northeast across country, likely. We're something awful. There's cases 1918 troop transport ships swept through. nice natural 1,117 members 40th Reinforcements board, sickened pandemic influenza strain, 77 died""

Let's assume EVERYONE board got it. That's 6.9% death rate - granted among young adults, population hit hardest strain. Bingo. Die virus economic collapse. choose can't reliably contract trace virus many cases asymptomatic symptoms set days. Exactly. somehow unsafe outside w/ one around eating inside enclosed restaurants safe lmao (I'm MD MD DC implemented this) grocery store worker, customers ever treat us humans? I'm treated like robot. people nice, time I'm seen. need understand live one populous states, people national votes worth much yours. Really?

the NY Times saying 60,000 excess deaths US 100% due COVID infection. Thank you! would they? Agree everything including Interplanetary warheads, way, almost impossible deliver equally well equipped foe present day technology.

I think point challenges colonists applies here. Even though Mars, may abilities nation back home sent there. 

Two Earths facing off, would different story (and fun movie). Look mister virtuous here... know gotten better time? self righteousness... well, unless anoying kid.

The worst thing mostly agree points too... even talk like supreme leader Trump! Jk tell read trumps voice lol seriously. ""YoU WoRk HoMe"" uh okay fine, whatever lame unchallenging bodyweight exercises do, plus one pair 8 lb dumbbells afford - Win! can't even jump 3rd floor apartment thin crappy floors, can't afford treadmill stationary bike, can't run outside bc 102 degrees F 95% humidity ""sTAy HoMe StAy SAfE"" binging fast food bed drinking day amirite I've working 41 hours week whole pandemic fucks preventing millions Americans getting money desperately need complaining ""free loaders"" fuck like 3 weeks mooching tax payer, fucking sickening. think fair calculation ‚Äúcollateral damage‚Äù COVID pandemic. People died world changed due COVID. Meaning didn‚Äôt contract COVID died anyway. 

A doctor telling hospital seen amputations triple pandemic, people either afraid go hospital doctors busy. time got hospital late anything. **just** got email job saying everyone returning office next week.

I'm one wearing mask. 

This whole office going get it, matter time. fuck even talking about? I'm NP us take seriously scared. mean prophylaxis? mean PPE, I'm given one surgical mask day. prophylaxis. still White House.

I tested negative March, bunch people around got sick person Seattle initial outbreak happened get sick soon returned.

I symptoms except body aches weeks fever 12 hours pretty intense heart pain difficulty breathing. People told anxiety, nearly 5 months later still chest pain almost every day. hotel? roomservice, TV‚Äôs etc. Bring computer books. I'm confused self administered tests. byproduct respiration anti-maskers even scared of?  Gee wonder really worth risking life?

Stop nonsense. People like enjoy life, completely normal. Going friends paying extra experience, people get tired houses live large lots land whatever want time. majority people living small homes, apartments condos going necessary. 

Enjoy life completely worth risk getting 0.26% death rate virus. *Nervous NH resident* Yeah, Palpatine loved democracy, too. missing context. Also 350 million estimate end pandemic whereas 800k half-baked official tally (that's pretty low) middle first wave pandemic. that's apples oranges.  

But put context baseline mortality rates Spanish Flu bad...but everything bad back then. much worse normal? COVID-19 comparison low tally far thanks modern medicine largely. way baseline mortality. Nobody expects Spanish ~~Inquisition~~ Flu! Actually ESTIMATED killed 34-100k Americans 18 months, methodology COVID already killed 200k 6 months.

But you‚Äôre stupid already knew that, lying easier make point though. mean people travel across country planet come contact thousands people? Dont forget Scott Atlas - trump's new coronavirus advisor Stanford says 'ludicrous' open schools person play college football. Dude seen x-ray two time really knows he's talking about. #1 rule science is: garbage in, garbage (in relation bad data collection). Exactly fact USA 70 million tests performed means tracking network far stronger  Tourists ones contributing drop ridership. one going work anymore is... Everyone would normally work city working home. 

 

List United States rapid transit systems ridership

**System Annual ridership (2019)**

1.New York City Subway  2,274,960,100

2.Washington Metro  237,701,100

3.Chicago ""L""  218,467,000 I'm wondering NY staying flat low.  wonder approaching herd immunity already it.

Now supposed like 70-80% baseline started around 50% already sort immunity. Get extra 20-25% infected surviving pretty damn close it. 

Also watching blowing areas low cases beginning, like Hawaii.  Let's say there's 20% population immunity all, likely get even limited exposure.

Of course speculation NYC another peak, might validity. crazy packed totally isolated still low number cases. I've heard phrase ""we're building plane fly it"" used constantly describe challenges Pandemic response. Seems like good analogy. However, wtf supposed first class full mentally deranged sociopaths, running around circles outraged everything, setting plane fire? It‚Äôll remembered American flu hundred years guaranteed. So, would say we're back normal? Yeah I'm going go 5k day. 500nand 1k seems like almost nothing almost pointless. yet threads like based around non peer reviewed claims allowed stay?

Guess OK post information fits narrative whole 'multiple strains speculative/untrue' allowed stay. Explains lot posts here. ‚ÄúMany community outbreaks COVID traced places individuals remove masks‚Äù problem decades making. First, hospitals profit driven, hire absolute minimum number people possible. Second, certain number people become doctors year US. sane healthcare system could overflowing doctors healthcare people, instead already operating thinnest margins.

Worst Repuicans Democrats love system, disagree much people screwed it. find many politicans arguing need remove profit motive healthcare. friggin hope Farts? think new law cases emergency Senate allowed massive breaks. really fair really jobs time especially getting paid government healthcare benefits. shit. I'll bet NYC's positivity rte keeps falling, they're people inside restaurants &amp; bars yet. 1/3 US get shadowy internet presence supports Trump admin said Bill Gates liberals trying microchip us. testing beyond beef meat En masse!!!!!! Wait.. Don‚Äòt guys need go College become nurse? 

How tf one stupid uneducated literally pursuing higher education? daily breakdown exactly encouraging, 1 2 4 4 7 already them, prisons ice camps. US government great /s read here, COVID death toll likely even higher that, seems like really tough thing estimate. lockdowns caused much lower death rates causes (like auto accidents), we're talking ""excess"" deaths COVID already compensated lower mortality causes. Question someone maybe background this:

I know wear surgical mask n95 valve, however could also rig one mask inserts inside valve still effectively protecting others, yet still valve (albeit probably less effectively ventilation/cooling) work alright?  Automation. Exactly. like Amazon warehouses.

A computer system tells exactly do, it, much time gives score based perform. designed train become faster, efficient take less toilet brakes.

Tears part programming. fucking believeble! Romans 2:1. Therefore excuse, man, every one judges. passing judgment another condemn yourself, you, judge, practice things shitty they're open, sounds like gonna happen matter - least there's one testing facility available. Thank reply. correct, edit. large droplets trapped small particles pass through. understanding cloth mask face covering donned breathed contamination inhaled exhaled would present offer protection wearer bystander. Mixed population fear close contact situations high rate improper mask useage, including bad hand hygiene mask handling potentially could cause severe situation one wearing masks fearful close contact situations. 

I wish well war. nice day! shaved $1 trillion relief package. Republicans moved. wrote far truth, par course 5 day old account. 50% effective (which CDC said bar approval), still 50/50 shot getting infected. need entire country get hit close heard immunity. vaccines effective. less effective. guess needed /s there. Trump sucks, he's responsible mess, countless deaths.

Edit: yes, rich Trump crew stole money meant keep average citizen alive pandemic. Yet another thing pissed about. case common cold/flu? people get easily, others don't, even though healthy/same age group etc? kidney disease probably year half ago kidneys stopped part processing calcium vitamin D, means get post-processed version. started taking noticed increase energy, better moods, even sleeping better. Even still wonder deficient tested function parathyroid hormone opposed checking actual blood levels calcium vitamin D.

Now couple years later I've slipped, I'm part blaming Covid world general right lack mood. I'm already recluse thanks health, discovered much lived everyone else things telling them. we're mostly sitting home pajamas still. without masks. effects masks limited, especially outdoors. situations masks great, times much safer better options.

Unfortunately seems US believes masks thing works. killing lot people. I‚Äôm well aware NP is. offense there‚Äôs reason you‚Äôre one instead actual doctor. also reason get prophylactic first. think NBA officially confirm it? Lol Yes authoritarian countries as.... *checks notes* Italy, France, Germany, New Zealand.

Like really ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù ‚Äúliberty‚Äù force workers go expose deadly disease middle class people sit restaurant waited instead ordering delivery?

That doesn‚Äôt sound like freedom me. Sounds like recipe hundreds thousands needless deaths ‚Äî exactly we‚Äôre getting. Realistically, care. They'd rather continue life normally pay heartfelt tribute fallen students staff yearbook wash away guilt. third, 100%. either. üò´ don‚Äôt data, it‚Äôs tiny comparison. 
(I mean redditüòâ) Ahhh mistake apologize Well, Dr. Fauci, fired. new job counting paperclips.    
Meet Dr. Scott Atlas, Trump's new coronavirus advisor.            
*""Atlas healthcare policy expert works Hoover Institute, conservative think tank Stanford University. infectious-diseases expert.*    
*Since beginning US coronavirus outbreak, Atlas spoken imposing lockdown measures, saying impedes herd immunity ...*""    
He'll Trump ""yes"" man, issuing happy talk President desires. Nah, nothing say response comment literally testing stats. Nice zinger tho. imagine Donald Trump played huuuuge part figure. think number would high wore mask told people wear one? 7-8 months he's telling people ignore doctors &amp; scientists. 

Unfortunately less educated people, made afraid, seem support who/what think powerful. see Trump spineless pathetic (he literally wear mask would make look weak. president shouldnt afraid virus. That's NK leader worship stuff) supporters see man wont back anybody, supporting makes feel strong. Parachute seems working great, let's take now.

(Still 1500' ground level.) enough, yes. Basically lower percent positive, likely captured enough data accurate idea extent disease. higher percent positive, less certain what's actually going on. covid denialist, optimists, sweeds never humble matter often proved wrong. hold breath confirm, everyday poo water keeps healthy date. em‚Äô re-elected anyways. like care. let‚Äôs experiment children, right? need minimize effects economy Trump win again. won't. Despite recent bump C-19 deaths, overall deaths US lowest level 2020. Even lower pre-pandemic levels. Depends long movie out. Release weekend ticket sales go studio. month goes theater. reality left weeks come compromise right issue adamently refused cooperation, compromise, notion working side, know nothing ends getting passed, everyone blame right, see thread. right begging compromise weeks. Personally think giving people money better giving money, left doesnt care that. say ""no compromise"" act like good guys holding money. reality, result: deal, help anyone. reality left cares winning political points helping people. know everyone goes homeless, hungry, dies disease, right party suffer it. perfectly willing let happen means win election. fucking disgusting ‚ÄúSo said people slow testing please‚Äù Remember November! [CDC says best estimate, would double.  biggest concern school age children become seriously ill, although will. issue school environment allows virus spread people go community large.

These kids go local stores, visit grandparents, pass along parents take wherever go. They'll go trips visit family Thanksgiving spread new areas. 

I think clear United States would've better taken coordinated, aggressive approach start truly minimized virus' spread. 50% effort we're giving means we're stringing along without making progress. 6% lot. suggests let herd immunity happen (with 80% infection), expect deaths times amount UK? know of*. people

Basically people decide want truth ignore everything confirm it. doctor know NP is.

I call bullshit. correct answer wearing properly fitting mask.

YMMV opinion India's stats much press gets. sure seemed odd cases started dropping dramatically couple weeks ago reason. Apparently massive drop testing why. Trump got wanted, clearly.

No. try compromise. Nope, all. know people came strange viral infection (severe fatigue, heavy cough, fever) going around October/November, never got it.

Incidentally, good friend mine (also nurse) got strange viral infection October.

Meanwhile covid, well, guess burning pile become home. Maybe that's fucky karma.. Yeah must something blame somebody else think less people going get tested...all testing sites, long lines disappeared change said, ""considering"" something make true. mean sound like asshole going make number without providing math behind it?

There stark difference users sub /r/covid19. B gross phenotypes, technically, along AB, genotypically (technically, guess would phenotypes well) plenty - omit B - omit there. wonder ""subtypes"" B fare comparison? get fine caught without mask? shops deny entry wearing mask? 

It's yes question country. link real peer reviewed studies instead opinion pieces dedicated misinformation site even understand concept density dependent relationships? work health center local college. We're expecting approximately 100 identified cases semester. would probably take something like 500 school send students home. I'd say odds pretty low. theatre

I'm stealing this. accurate description organization's Coronavirus response.

Upvote given. beard red. nation? canceled football  Can't increased deaths non covid related illnesses still attributed overall issues caused pandemic? point article? Ok, troll. pursued vaccine development SARS, would development vaccine sped up? know basically took left off, thought came vaccine incredibly quickly rest testing. someone lives S√∂dermanland, tell people obedient strict regarding social distancing. also see wearing masks, great even though FHM set recommendation. Although still bit nervous schools opening soon. Says fat troll mom's basement One city went highest level (4?), rest country still went level 3 (1 max)

They even talking possibly postponing elections. Spring realistic goal time table. mid November one two vaccines enough doses 50 million people could done end year. Getting enough 200 million people April hard imagine.

As people claim get one now, change end year. 4 months kids home, school change lot minds. http://cbs12.com/news/local/autopsy-shows-wellington-nurse-died-of-kidney-infection-not-covid-19 agree, read article yesterday cloth masks useless, even valved HIPA masks work. guess point little protection better protection, even protection virtually useless.

 I.e. tell boss ""knock off."" use adult respectful words behavior get point across want treated respect. also British/UK study going differ procedure materials American counter parts.

Is meant intentionally mislead redditors thinking valid point demonstrates carefree attitude medical professionals lump deaths Covid-19 related, definantially case demonstrated source. got fired second job 19 day one relief-filled hopeful moments entire life. Absolutely **FUCK** dry food ingredient packing plants. fuck say. I've sounding alarms since February. Stupid people listen smart people.

Being alarmist makes smart. makes panicky. Guessing correctly also make knowledgeable. FDA said wont approve vaccine less 50% efficacy. efficacy approved. removing valve function mask?

Sounds like valve problem despite nonsense claims misinformation. Mitchell Webb nazis shit really?!?! 









/s doesn‚Äôt seem good infecting people it‚Äôs surfaces though, like yes it‚Äôs possible hasn‚Äôt shown major vector article say instead leading people believe valved masks bad exceptions. misinformation telling entire truth. offense know that's symptom now? far commonly reported symptom media biggest tell.

Anyway thanks going home, please get tested quarantine get results (and obviously continue positive). People forget dirty money is. It‚Äôs touched many people. 102 years passed. people time period mostly dead unless centenarians. Oh wait opening schools bad idea! could guessed! it‚Äôs gone suck blow. company work released benefits email calling COVID Black Lives Matter movement negative distractions. yeah, we're meat. public moral kind think someone watching. Actually I'm critical care nurse. Stop reading conspiracy theories. hospitals get overwhelmed, economy dies. test result takes two weeks now

They've caught bit, partly drop testing. Diagnostics says expected turnaround time 2-3 days, less priority patients. LabCorp announced similar turnaround time last week.
  
Though I'm sure there's bound regional difference Free day care serfs get back work. Honestly young redneck men worse karens. maybe rare, deadlier karens..  fucking hate state. goddamn scary much one seems care virus anymore. Get used headline repeating next several weeks. local district starts Monday...And we've seen spike infections/positivity rate, ever last week... even treat us like humans anymore.

False. 

I've worked grocery store. Thry never treated like human. brother‚Äôs girlfriend similar position got COVID unit. extra compensation concern. Aside one night fever spiked around 102, largely asymptomatic, communication confined asking soon could come back. Trump said, hospitals get tested. Though, know Dallas Europe. Packed people like you? manager needed answer couple pointed questions:

- store policy inform customers bags contain frozen items leave? Yes do.

- not, fault customer put bag frozen items pantry? Please detailed. Yep. Republicans always use war boost ratings. It‚Äôs have. Dems always try keep us wars racists call weak. That‚Äôs Trump trying start new wars steal election. sheep herd thin Agreed, Bettman holding bubble first world democracy genius. Silver's plan worked far lot variables - primarily fact bubble surrounded barely functioning state. read studies past 40 years regarding UBI? would venture say due response. people good understanding economics support it. 

The problem ideas, anti intellectualism refusal even rational discussions relevant topics.
It's peolle would rather repeat nonsense heard godawful talk radio show saw terrible source online actually explore discuss ideas. 
It's refusal compromise ever admit fault.

It's also arguing unspoken, polarizing strawman bad faith. Nowhere post replied suggestion everyone quit jobs stay home. That's absurd argument lock bad flu year value lives highly.

It‚Äôs cold blooded able look costs economically decisions made. 

The government makes decisions laws everyday indirectly cause deaths benefit society. Okay, instance came see them, presumably like Smash Mouth. go see band like. Hey, don‚Äôt bring eggos this. They‚Äôve done nothing wrong. pretty clear point people, even age group, equally affected. people may immune due previous infection provided antibodies, may genetic, may Vitamin D, we're sure. wide range effect, dead couple days completely asymptomatic, that's clearly one size fits kind thing. mean, reasonable estimates 40% cases asymptomatic.  Cool story, bro. Came say lol plan relax lockdowns 3 days. then, tested everyone may exposed. South Korean steady stage approach proving superior. Instead opening fully unpredictably shutting whenever outbreak, test seventeen thousand people every day, maintain constant state caution reasonable restrictions. tested like 40 people? X-ray tech, ultra sound tech, ct tech. MRI tech, hospital cleaner, hospital kitchen worker...  *What going Sweden??* thought guys shit together! always seem(ed) bright, level headed, smart! important... I'm Belgium, control border prevent french people come beach Belgium french people cut small roads avoid controls... lot Belgians spend day 2 Netherlands less controle us virus... 
Well living island means avoid situations people donwnvote deliberately denying facts eality know 2 people covid 19. hodpitalized. Solidarity! Wearing masks would good start. According CDC US wore masks 1-2 months they'd get COVID-19 back control.

Again, possible United States well New Zealand. could literally copy exactly NZ doing... wanted to. making choice to, just... get hate masks. Even mask mandates permanent (which surely be), impactful would everyday life? Wearing mask would eventually akin putting shoes. already become mundane me, feel like ultra-minority. i'm doctor, think might worth try anti inflammatory diet. obviously, see physician going one, 10 years one knows happening you, see could hurt try something like altering diet. Probably best call disinformation.  Try bit more! Except clearly study enough bonobos occur predictors essential perfect situation humans dont late for. able fuck aggresive behaviors that's possible cases environment gone too. unsustainable predictors shit compared chimpanzees would get eaten die like humans encroaching killing them. yeah work ideal, easily bought illusion people short attention spans. Still love primates primatologist people romanticize bonobos without knowing shit. Happy you! second job massage therapist close much pandemic grocery job picked slack. Dealing people ideal. respect decision big time! mean would really prefer kept wearing masks rest time. wouldn‚Äôt want save literally thousands lives every flu season? Unless dictatorship, junta anywhere notorious 'creative' accounting, case numbers taken face value. can't find local flu shot provider make us come facility ... shared space also sees sick people certainly account asymptomatic spread. know do, ridiculous IMO. Seriously? sub really feminized 2% death rate sounds scary? button press 2% chance killing I'd press day. That's literally nothing. odds dying falling bed greater practically. We're wrecking world nothing. consistent Covid-19 deniers there.


Good China's lying, deadly claim. Yay Oompa Loompah shut travel China stop deadly virus. exist. hoax. kills old people. gonna disappear like miracle. Cheap malaria meds cure it. Masks make hard breathe! get enough oxygen! Besides Covid-19 passes right masks like there. ~ Deniers



Even understand masks work. remember anything elementary school science, can't people see deniers litteraly going back forth claiming deadly got U.S., became hoax, back killing people old people. overweight people, like many Americans are. Smart Choice!   Man guys hang shitty women. ""Give convenience give death!"" -Jello Biafra yet, police tear gas beat them? Seems like pretty grave error major departure US police procedure, situation definitely called stern response. What's ChiliHead?

 *‚ÄúWe care deeply every ChiliHead disappointed incident took place Baton Rouge Chili‚Äôs August 9.* Yeah, know. point know many people actually died certain day months, numbers announce much substitute, include deaths day previous five months, tell us much UK actually right now. Yeah heard too. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message*  CFR varies 1% 10%, depending country look at. scientific data I've seen likely true CFR probably 0.5% 2% (accounting cases asymptomatic mild enough never get tested advances treatment). Assuming US going 50% infection rate CFR 1% 1.5 million dead... 

What helps though, spread still relatively slow. Currently 50k new cases per day. Assuming real number 10 times higher (that's Europe seeing) take 300 days reach 50% penetration. time vaccine works tested, probably earlier.

Unfortunately, US numbers .. well.. ""nice clean"", would equally valid assume real number cases 20 times higher. would bring numbers 150 days.... Or, herd immunity entails end year, vaccine could administered.

So, unless US (or least states) something quickly, another 200k 500k fatalities end year even optimistic assumptions. What's scarier supporters even blink statements like that. Either theatrics another case people ""Not knowing know about"" still spreading ""knowledge.""

Imagining Gilded Redditor wearing ~non-vented surgical mask~ approaching store fog covered glasses due leakage telling ""Hey gas mask, modify mask hanging surgical mask exhale port."" Enjoyable logic. exactly New Zealand USA starting tomorrow like what‚Äôs plan action long lockdown for? it‚Äôs literally impossible example looking purely cases testing amount independently mean much. hospitalization, death rate positivity rate.

None mentioned here. Remember vote next election. dont, things remain same. attitude ""my vote wont count anyways""... well non vote last election got this. Enlarged spleen, never identified cause. Also anemic, lots vitamins that's it. says spreads easily‚Äînot it‚Äôs dangerous. Hotspots initially stricken hard virus gotten point ~20% population antibodies. spots, seeing rise number infections. speculate immunity granted via cell response studies shown possible. Now, proof many people gain immunity way, fact see rise infections reaching 20% weak evidence immunity may granted cellular response rather via antibodies. 

Perhaps could've worded first comment better. Part two major political parties essentially choose country choice vote for. people start voting outside two parties dictated run country. It‚Äôs fallacy believe American people options two shitty candidates. two parties make difficult get third party representatives debates. also need better voting practices allow people work long hours able vote, general need people vote. Unfortunately education system doesn‚Äôt always great job teaching government works, people feel like can‚Äôt make difference. Shills full force calling everyone racist trusting Chinese government. Ignore downvotes. let make race.

You like assumed husbands abusive right? Complain little entire checkout industry replaced. already got self checkouts there...eyeballing you....about steal job!!! SARS contained, MERS also contained. less infectious hit non-shithole countries hardest US. delightful thing Americans absolutely historical memory. Wtf going Sweden. always lumped Norwegian utopian countries. fundamentally different? test, virus. Boom! That's genius. Next level approach USA yet again.


Pay mind massive spikes pneumonia/flu/stroke/cardiovascular/heart failure/natural causes deaths hospitalizations coming winter state near though. Tennessee's decrease testing easily explained. Look, get it, we're conservative hell hole. used liberal, built heck health department back day. forefront testing started, two biggest counties also free testing available anyone regardless symptoms. 

We seen drop hospitalizations county matches drop positive tests we've seen. drop positive tests, drop amount tests performed, lined two biggest counties instituting mask mandates locking harder.

Our positivity rate Nashville also slowly decreasing, transmission rate 0.8. 

So everyone jumps conclusions testing declines due feds whatever, please realize every state different different epicenters infection different things going on. could shenanigans states, states reporting pretty honestly. fyi like annoyance anger. We're busy arguing abortion, birth control, gets use bathroom, gets marry wall. China, especially cities, people using cash even pandemic, said one reason Chinese people performed well controlling coronavirus I'm store, tried say little interact little possible reduce exposure people's exposure me. definitely see might come terse rude I'd rather seem rude stand yakking cashier spreading germs place.

Yes, no, thank you. words say stores anymore. Fuck babyfaced bastard Gone shopping recently? many people without masks. I'm sure hell wearing mask protection. many plague-ridden sickos there. Honestly, eyes, appreciate people choose come in. Less people store better. I'm trying argue you. I'm speculating connection mask refusal, confrontation risk taking. excuse either. might explain though understanding might help find ways prevent issue arising. think people would take positive result seriously instructions quarantine two weeks case. Yes, tests take time, excuse test taking two weeks. Lab capacity must increased tests meaningful. got little respect books somebody thinks Bible real... 40% positivity rate means enough testing virus prevalent population. need testing accurate forecast. Incidence standard method gauging effectiveness current precautions containing spread. Random testing would better studying disease prevalence populations given many hospitals filling people getting positive tests means need impose new precautions. Yes, board none nonsense! crazy people worry surveillance state love shit?

There coherent logic white entitlement comfort convenience costs.  Old men worst customers imo.

Honestly handle yelled Karen. going do? Call cops take side?

But old men just..scary. threaten beat up. yelling loud face gets super bright red. even start spitting place yell. 

 Karens make laugh. Old men make feel like im going get murdered.  Vietnam, South Korea, Tawain lower cases per capita New Zealand.

Countries making choice well New Zealand. can't well, they're choosing to. going say thing u/sarsartar. people power litteraly, access another worms entirely. elects people run country suppprts major corporations patronage. could easily stop easier said done. Surpringly America hasn‚Äôt hit rock bottom yet. sure that‚Äôs possible bc things look pretty bleak me. It‚Äôs like friends addict, love also dreading hearing well. Tbh Mumbai still reporting 1000 cases daily still lot looks like mistake though think. It'd worse 65s surely.

Probably, people T-cell response due coronaviruses, leading asymptomatic infection:

1. T-cell protection recent exposure could weaker, meaning body actually gets far antibody production, young people fight without produce antibodies; and/or
2. T-cell protection exposure 60+ years ago another coronavirus outbreak, might gone unnoticed time, similar SARS-COV2 known coronaviruses, could give over-65s edge, leading proportionately fewer symptomatic infections. personally, anything sort. sub dominated 2 factions- desperate feed confirmation bias virus gonna burn out...

&amp;#x200B;

 look data see things still ominous numbers made much sense ever since data taken White House task force instead CDC. No, packaging case. surface sample collected packaging surface. 

Dead chicken meat can't infect virus. However, frozen, could contaminated well, case. Elections enough, something younger people voluntarily voting (that widespread disenfranchisement) sadden me.

I‚Äôm 30‚Äôs old enough remember young voters got 8 years Obama even letting Dems control senate congress: 

Nothing. 

Voting won‚Äôt get anything, politicians care well-being. way get anything direct action. US #1 undercounting excess mortality. US actually relatively honest compared many countries. Economist article compares excess deaths reported COVID deaths across many countries. Many Central/South American countries absurdly undercounting deaths, excess mortality 200-500% reported COVID deaths. Russia similarly properly counting, excess mortality nearly 300% reported COVID deaths.  Spain's excess mortality 50% higher, Italy's 36% higher, Netherlands 50% higher, US 32% land somewhere doesn‚Äôt give right take land native peoples also torture generations afterwards. Imagine losing ancestral home treated like subhuman.. US blood hands, shouldn‚Äôt forgotten. ‚ÄúFrom on‚Äù? wasn‚Äôt always case? positive, picked sent isolation immediately. heard Melbourne positive cases stay home even allowed outside exercise? Crazy. dumbest part one still get exact fucking cheeseburger eat home instead much, much lower risk infection. stupidity baffling. fucked reason.

Yes, highly infectious possibly deadly disease fucked up. absolutely right. Duke tested total ONE neck gaiter made ONE type material. rest mouth coverings tested masks, one gaiter.

To extrapolate ""all neck gaiters bad"" based sample size one made one type material science, misinformation! username definitely checks man. goes beyond death. It‚Äôs giving public false sense security hygiene theatre. tried true way combat disease social distancing masking up. Restaurants, whether indoor outdoor, antithesis that. Many outdoor dining areas covered gazebos window open. virus doesn‚Äôt give shit loopholes, it‚Äôs continues spread communities. RESTAURANTS. know sub joke open 8 stories frontpage lmao. atleast half sound fake fuck lol aren‚Äôt NZ natives... businesses haven‚Äôt destroyed this. countries beginning slip economic landslide. Correct

Duke tested total ONE neck gaiter made ONE type material. rest mouth coverings tested masks, one gaiter.

To extrapolate ""all neck gaiters bad"" based sample size one made one type material science, misinformation. Good article. Yeah, vaccine first step. Logistics storage, distribution, injection something else entirely.

Not real reassuring manufacturers saying US gov't placed orders yet need hundreds millions doses months.

One part concerned final step process vaccine manufacturing known ‚Äúfill finish,‚Äù vaccines chemicals piped vials, sealed checked. Many plants today fill finish tens thousands vaccine doses per hour, immediate need billions doses, even fastest robotic filling arm reason, says Blayer Path, first wave vaccines likely multiple doses vial. urgency demand may mean multiple-dose vials won‚Äôt contain preservatives, normally undergo extensive testing ensure chemicals don‚Äôt react adversely. case, Blayer says, ‚Äúall doses vial used six hours vial opened, according [World Health Organization] requirements.‚Äù


So likely preservatives testing takes extra time, vaccine also need used quickly opened. see lot waste and/or lot potential using ""expired"" vaccine. every dose measured location administer it. Unlike deniers keep use arguments even contradict because.


Like Oxygen atoms can't get masks people breathe, Covid-19 virus that's 100 times larger Oxygen atoms flies like nothings there.


And apparently deniers forgot claimed China lying deadly WuHan bat flu was. proud Giant Orange Oompa Loompah shut travel protect U.S. China Flu. started calling hoax fake news. malaria medicine would cure fake hoax flu, apparently needed cure. kills old people, ignoring 20% 65 died, well 32,000 now.



Yeah, consistant scientific deniers, must prefer doctors worried alien DNA demon semen. think theres big difference mask wearing public (which do) locked away family 2+ weeks solitary confinement. long isn‚Äôt new New York Plenty came from. EU following USA‚Äôs example Masks social distancing countries successfully reopened. trying take us path permanent closure need haircut whatever. Grow up. Misinformation.

Duke tested total ONE neck gaiter made ONE type material. rest mouth coverings tested masks, one gaiter.

To extrapolate ""all neck gaiters bad"" based sample size one made one type material science, misinformation. people doubting insane reasons like bullshit satellite maps supposedly showing fields burning bodies single video showed seven bodies taken hospital. seventy, seventeen, seven. lol. painfully gullible. Yeah, you‚Äôre using logic. 

I don‚Äôt know bosses personally, imagine aren‚Äôt afraid getting called BS. Correct, Duke tested total 1 neck gaiter.

To extrapolate ""all neck gaiters bad"" based sample size one made one type material science, misinformation. know catch again? vaccine, also enough people take despite Alex Jones, Rush Limbaugh, ""demon semen"" doctor telling people full poisoned microchips. 

You *know* we're fucking doomed, right? link official data shows ""excess urns""? 

You know urn story came Radio Free Asia, citing anonymous netizens napkin math, official government statistics, right? statistically middle aged women likely steal stores, wonder also worst customers. There's even guarantee someone become immune it. China people started becoming infected second time, weeks ended lockdown. personally friend March (here states) got two weeks ago. Even 50-70% get it, many get second time, even third, many ones get second time survive destruction lungs systems. you. us, everyone fully grown adult little experience work with.

This line thought would hold water 18-25 voting demographic completely abandoned America kids 'going save world' Gen Z's age. turns can't expect bunch scared teenagers treat like shit fix problems

Yeah age, actually things life live. What's going Z that's preoccupying? School nonexistant, everything closed, literally fascist office. *They nothing better nothing lose something.* went Occupy you

It absolutely fucking is. Boomers last months longer majority. better time Z start getting involved now, Millennials they're going new voting majority year...*assuming* actually get asses vote. doesn‚Äôt change fact people getting restaurants can‚Äôt deny w logic I‚Äôm register jockey local grocery chain branch. convince fellow wage slaves deserve better, help us unionize? It‚Äôs funny think makes sound tough show you‚Äôre sociopath lol. tldr: government can't plan listen experts. Like always. 

To make worse: today A-Level BTEC results day England. grades calculated using teachers recommendations combined school's previous history - essentially making postcode lottery. trying make better (pupils use mock exam results) they've managed make things worse.

40% pupils results lowered exams, next month lot Uni campuses open. likely cause second outbreak potentially.

The government, exam boards education minister warned since April. voted every single general election since turned 18, nearly 20 years ago. missed one primary time. never posted going crosspost check feature. seems weird wasn't, no? vented mask unfiltered exhaust port. point. out-compete others. like people lining security forklift work top barrel geniuses LOL article make clear. that's case absolutely zero issue this. day, customer told love personal shopper always nice explain everything clearly. getting teary-eyed that. meant offer tip I've gotten customer (Walmart let us collect tips anyway, competitors allow tips). I've ways interested history chemical biological weapons. COVID-19 vs ebola really demonstrates bio weapons work. think ebola type weapon, reality lethal easy contain. really effective need something like COVID, spread incognito weeks infrastructure collapses. type virus eventually come home roost. breaks infrastructure too. Oh.. BTW: CFR half story. Long term effects Covid-19 poorly understood, see extremely worrying. expect high number cardio-vascular mental diseases nest 10-20 years, already know. Heck, evidence Covid-19 infection trigger dementia people age 60. Ok, Cancer Duke tested total ONE neck gaiter made ONE type material. rest mouth coverings tested masks, one gaiter.

To extrapolate ""all neck gaiters bad"" based sample size one made one type material science, misinformation. guys restaurant workers.  Thanks hanging UK start requiring masks two weeks ago. Everywhere we've seen lockdown mask requirements we've seen cases drop around two week mark.

Masks end-all-be-all literally asked start answered question. Ideally would also contact tracing lockdown measures involved get virus control. significantly better economy take steps get virus control get back life normal 1-2 months going continue let COVID-19 cases stick around next year more. work local supermarket summers college classes, man, last summer rollercoaster. guess I'm lucky am, couple people who've yelled, many thanked workers.

There's even one guy, past 20 years coming store, buys couple candy bars leaves us us enjoy. He's great guy around too, friendly always extremely polite survive long room temperature. survive weeks transportation storage temperature low enough. brought best also worst humanity. think happening hospital work London spread like wildfire reason

Probably spreads like wildfire. Uh oh why?. fever?...well so, least know covid-19, I'd "" asymptomatic "" like 99% people ""test positive"". Funny stopped saying covid-19, buzz words are...they tested positive - person charge. H1N1 pandemic 1917 (Spanish flu) 2% death rate. So, yes 2% death rate actually scary. take account long term health issues discovered. put on...but pain ass. One nothing other. argument made vaccines developed western nations people treat sort antivaxxer covid denier. perspective that's one 9-11 attack every day... F okay? entire household infected, seen China Italy many ppl live multigenerational households. stories several generations families completely wiped out. Half dozen studies tell us prolonged contact plus stale circulation = everyone get infected. Today good...because day off! assume play casinos too. Oh wow. We‚Äôre 2 weeks already. Labor Day, we‚Äôll re-evaluate. Misinformation.

Duke tested total ONE neck gaiter made ONE type material. rest mouth coverings tested masks, one gaiter.

Browns fan. always wonder dictators got away things reading comments makes sense. Nice context snip. What's like what's wrong world? know kind idiot this? come natural you. world either destroys covid working vaccine developed deployed 100%, county beat virus. Know what's pain ass? Military checkpoints, curfews, dead economy. Put mask. coverage end month you‚Äôre laid in. Then, you‚Äôll offered COBRA coverage, expensive less uninsured hospital bill.

Everything, think it, dangerous leaving home. Interestingly, though he's known conservative, [Peyton Manning advocating wearing mask guess, opposite.

Probably people see number deaths kind validation pre-existing ideas. people enjoy seeing dead Americans. global pandemic making life harder?

This pretty obvious statement make see would prompt sarcasm. problem say this. Correct, secure infrastructure allow increased testing expedited results. something countries success battling virus secured early on. wealthiest country world though. is. Probably true. district ""optimize infection vectors"" method every day school. kids go school one day, go day care next, back again, thereby maximizing potential exposure! get first available dont want miss super powers give workers shirts describe parody flag raising Iwo Jima two back guys doctors nurses front guy Walmart vest on. insulting refuse wear it. guess Euronews used Belgium instead.

Nope, actually Brussels, still thinking Brussels metonym widen Belgium. long ago study posted confirming asymptomatic people (not pre-symptomatic, never develop symptoms) responsible 3-6% infections. Maria's statement likely correct, misunderstood differences asymptomatic pre-symptomatic. lot things surprised one one most. one logical epidemiological moves make, even effect people. really. Every person smart phone computer, frankly use telephone don't. would much safer can't believe even allow person shopping.

We failed thing many levels, really sad. Additionally, counted macroscopic droplets illuminated laser could seen vision system.

Light scattering perfect method measuring aerosols. authors study claim measured particles 0.5 Œºm (and improved better camera). size particles already fine aerosol (Sars-COV-2 much smaller 0.1 Œºm). Anything 10 Œºm stays suspended air quite long time. Get rid Trump get act together we'll talk next year! believe amount general assault threats get managing simple movie theater. Wait, think believe bible? world get idea? liars. Worst thing is, people support lmao sneeze gas mask, sneeze shoot exhaust port wearing mask all? ever worn gas mask? ever worn positive pressure PAPR hood? ever sneezed either? sneezed both. Highly interested hearing experiences compare mine. Assuming numbers right 6% England Covid19 already: still far cry \~70% necessary achieve heard immunity. I'm bringing apparently still people believe heard immunity (through infection) would one way pandemic. What's nearly month old article? Steering conversation perhaps? There's much evidence came lab origin theory. I'm still looking another betacoronavirus furin cleavage site. Odd SARS-CoV-2 *also* perfectly adapted *human* ACE II receptor. Perhaps we'll answer someday. Sooooo...source? Thanks, hate pathogen Mork Gork Everybody change this, tiny scale, daily. Every interaction someone retail cafe/restaurant - nice. work retail understand everyone shitty day come - me. civil. effort (but little) everyone appreciates it. realise sounds peace love make bad day little bit better everyone. Reality can‚Äôt expect 100% compliance public health policy yeah ive seen videos rabid people 2 $25‚Äôs 3 $10‚Äôs got source 50%? Thats works. huge majority deaths nursing homes, combining death rate others without giving context disingenuous. you‚Äôre 60 far lower. I'd recommend looking comments noticing there's ""teaching modesty"" going that's issue rule. reason conclude that. Thanks. products bad can‚Äôt even poured drain flushed. think Vitamin like people saying. studies simply state severe cases severe vitamin deficiency. They're correlated know causes it. may well play factor though. 

I think likely scenario exposed endemic coronaviruses past still killer T-Cells viruses also pretty effective covid-19. introduced large viral load, T-Cells could well killed virus without need antibodies. think are. republicans seem like policies lead dead school children. remember reading Vit deficiency theory back still mainly confined China. also recall noted resilience blood types.

As happens, I've always taken daily multi-vitamin, calcium/D3 supplement cod liver oil, diet great. like much dairy (cheese, yes, everything else no). Also, since I'm fair-skinned (red hair freckles), pretty much avoid sun.

That said, kinda find theory unsatisfying insomuch sounds crazy lot carnage could avoided Vit supplements. get downvoted, though, 'unsatisfying' mean simple solution otherwise enormous, complex problem. Yeah n95 probably better, see lot wearing construction type filtered masks, like say, filtering dusts made comment another post sub-reddit America Ghetto, 10/10 would recommend. Got downvoted hell questioned desire go medicine stand said here's why. 4th year medical student applying go Emergency Medicine currently, rotations busy level one trauma hospital major southern city. got pulled rotations back March medical school governing body pulled students rotations nationwide better understanding adequate PPE obtained. I've back wards since June let explain Adequate PPE is. OB/Gyn given 3 masks told made N95 material....but N95 mask. 3 masks supposed last 6 week rotation. trauma/ER rotation currently told provide PPE, meant going ED early shift nice charge nurse get get real N95 mask. Obtaining face shield pair googles near impossible one residents enlightened Home Depot goggles go early morning fly shelves. attending ranting administration RESTRICTING ER DOCTORS' NON APPROVED PPE, specifically brand new designed helmet adhesive face shield completely covers face attached tube creates negative pressure environment. told school's inability provide even pseudo N95 mask almost blew gasket. Mind seen woman open femur fracture hit car outside club tested positive COVID. excuse black millennial repurposed term ghetto describe dysfunctional societal structures negatively affect population whole. Still 10/10 would recommend. wish well Need sources please. Reality begs differ ‚Äúfacts logic‚Äù. virus real people dying. question that. I‚Äôve even friends pass away it. things, positives negatives decisions. schools opened schools closed real concrete lasting consequences society. It‚Äôs matter deciding decisions produce best result 5-10 years now. Dead teachers staff really bad. Millions kids edge, year disconnected attention guidance, probably lose path life end non-productive society also bad thing. highly doubt too. Grocery stores razor-thin margins. another example consumers selfish allow happen. would like see analysis this, would bet tiny increase every item (a $.05 1-2% increase) could offset paying people decent wage. 
On top that, customers need shamed tossed asses treating workers like slaves. happens couple times, learn happens. Test per capita good indicator though.

New Zealand Taiwan would higher cases. much cases. going test? grab random people street test. positive rate ifms going near 0, people going tested. 

Whereas US lot people test money get lot tests done. high list kinda meaningless. USA easily near top list due sheer number cases. know. know... US get cause lot secondary death too. 

The world economy depends large extend US economy. US economy goes down, developing countries fuel western economy feel first hardest. lots people starving orange ape concerned water flow shower head fellow citizens, swore protect, dying.

And no, that. weak US benefits one country: China. push forward approach getting developing countries adhesion contracts expand political influence them, making effectively vassal countries. achieving this, follow US ""might makes right"" doctrine lead people voice concerns Chinese enough end ""correction"" facilities.

YAY future!  Honestly everybody taking Vitamin supplements. mom got help seasonal depression disorder winter stopped taking it. Seems like genuine mood booster I'm unaware side effects really understand low number deaths lead suspicion. That's rather disingenuous way thinking.

Whenever comes statistics, scrutinizes methods context, well turn brain rather accepting assuming perfectly aligned jurisdictions, states, nations, personal creed. **""He passively accepts evil much involved helps perpetrate it. accepts evil without protesting really cooperating it.""** Yep. Still happily wiping groceries since March. (I whistle jaunty tune it.) Can't stop me. ;) link study? :) **employment** period

A concept missing hire first, prove yourself. still get job, need education experience for. 

You order wrong. can't hop job site, show know get hired. hire you, give training job, snuff, gone.

Having general knowledge useless without hired, hitting books Google going provide results unless formal education back up. matter believe COVID COVID care. going continue Adults America take charge help country, state, county community. Please become statistic like 200,000 American's enact change save lives. really technology isn‚Äôt predictably paced preventing deaths eslecislly exponential reaching periods like 1-4 years reside (the Philippines) came brilliant idea installing barrier (a makeshift verical fiberglass shoulder straps attached worn like bagpack) motorcycle driver passenger. Plus, must present marriage contract allowed transit. Unwed couples need try. See, smart ""leaders"" are? How's feel belligerent wrong? Trump's America. True, one states respond proactively mandate masks, cancel school, close restaurants, etc. precautions worked though, positivity rate almost 3% states around us double digits. Would say people stupid enough distrust science-based medical system USA compared China? Thank human guinea pigs way.

If schools close, really think I'll sending kids. sacrifices vain. Someone, somewhere learn this.

(Also, matter think, even true, kids get better quickly severe symptoms, long term effects, kids spreading it. Period.) never said needed care. said infectious sick. true statement nomatter try weasel already see America differently known test positive treated general public even testing negative.

What even talking about? one treated differently recover. getting idea from? oK fUcK fAcE Guilty charged. country 40% mean, heartless, cruel people. Sad really. essential worker morale time low... already job (bc there's ""skill level""), employer would rather paying less people dont respect bc ""anyone could it""... well, dont want it, need skill set! need start REAL discussion US VALUE LABOR. I‚Äôll continue use gaiter instead wasting money throw away masks thnx Seek help.  I've also working health/research contributing allocating processing power servers medical research Standford Project also get pass? I've serving health community years spending lots money electric bills! Please grant leniency crimes too! (rolls eyes).

What disturbs women power (at least powerful positions), either abuse authority, lie, cheat, even steal corrupt lives people (this case different worked favor).

I give perfect examples women fucked fucked lives people: Annie Dookhan, Sonja Farak , Dr. Jacqueline Cleggett. (all documentaries recommend watch too). Could elaborate this? I've seen whispers Kentucky's info wrong I'd love know more? Anyone complaining U.S. failing properly manage pandemic needs keep mind part strategy get soldiers sick end World War III twenty-five years. shut bars, restaurants, schools, wear masks etc etc well intentioned people stop dinner parties family get togethers we're gonna keep spreading it. 

It's like people think related friends can't get sick. numbers prove tiny sources deaths totally negligible compared COVID? meant social lives. hey, ""It is."" /s K-12 making look like well COVID, sad... think Venn diagram people attending restaurants people rude servers circle see article without subscription anywhere? Stay poor mad then. Works me. Where's 2nd stimulus payment americans? Id say 0,9%-1,6% chance dying quite horrible incurable. üçª school = childcare US, people can't work home, one take care kids they're work.  literally surprise finding long-term complications COVID-19. Viruses historically notorious causing long term issues, even ones relatively minor presentation. going see similar issues COVID-19, doubt. Fair enough He‚Äôs got Georgia mind, Indiana. test 100% perfect, pandemic little time properly develop produce tests. Organizations going offer outdoor flu shots year. low risk. SARS killed 800 people weird way define safe. Everyone! read post? someone quit working high school wasn‚Äôt awful. worked 25 hours week covid worst part manager douche, even corona. Maybe it‚Äôs cause lived worked produce didn‚Äôt worry enforcing masks (really high % people wore mask MA) people departments enforced mandatory masks entrance anyways ive decided trump re-elected, im GTFO too. good places go?

so far, ive heard New Zealand Aus welcoming Americans. latter. designed protect patient surgery. also ugly side.

Go look chart anti-Muslin hate crimes time period, clear year 2001, remember, year 3/4ths 9/11 problem facing sites major issue cheap wages labor exploitation. end tourist season Christmas shopping might muted year. Depends finding them. waiting people become concerned come forward, yes. contact tracing people even know they're ill, one's refusing tests, get bulk cases. Whole profile COVID doomerism. Reddit bought paid folks ever say transmitted food. think cook face souffl√© day? Nah come direct contact wait staff/bussers/bartenders almost centralized location heart restaurant. Oh yeah there‚Äôs windows kitchen, forget cracking open crank centralized ac Fuck, went post coudln't thread. fact get picked massively depressing. words, can't refute posted, basically researchers Duke UF come with. 

Keep ignoring science, dude. essential workers

We stop using term. essential workers would receiving essential worker pay, always given proper PPE, treated like essential workers. never essential workers, they're sacrificial workers. ""How treat people paid nice good indicator type person are""

or something like that... analysis take account over-reported Covid deaths (e.g. infamous motorcycle accident covid death, etc) well? stupid

The GOP working create generations dumb people (who vote GOP best interest) now. want defund higher education, push kids public schools indoctrinated private religious schools, pump lies masses GOP propaganda machine (Fox News). 


 yeah lot stupid people US. never Youre completey incompetent stick operating wendys drive ""How get skin cancer? hardly go outside except take bus""

**UVC:** brrrrrrr federal leadership worried billionaires. Who's going pay family's rent go back work without meeting reopening metrics end hospital? depends mask. Vented masks designed protect wearer hazards, surgical masks designed protect others. non vented n95s work best, protect ways. prefer calling lies. need invest polite terms things like lying abuse? Misinformation, alternative facts, mistruths, untruths, untrue statements. They're lies. reason trying real life like saying. spewing garbage get testy people call out? we're believing news comes China now? Yeah, people realise large amount cases people traveling bring, including seasonal workers.

Every Tuesday RKI Germany publishes statistics countries origin detected cases, top countries Germany Kosovo, Serbia, Turkey, etc.

Spain, Italy? lower list.

However media loves pick tourists went Mallorca la Costa Brava days, rather focusing guest workers come pick crops work slaughterhouses.

The way stop enforcing borders. ironic right, ones always advocating this, decided eat conspiracy theories say covid real, rather asking shut borders. Yeah ones still spouting stupid shit right comment history March. hard catch old comments comparing flu heat slow spread. Bunch losers honestly like imagine vehicle related deaths going year bars closed people going much, that‚Äôs nice guess countries tiring response telling people responsibility ""no u"" Ah thought meant purchase said order lol, yes think bar mask requirements every flu season Still scientific get enough oxygen mask, Covid-19 passes right anyway. question is: much population needs antibodies herd immunity?

30,000 foot view: depends communicable disease is. spreading slowly Arizona, Texas, Florida social distancing etc, 20% people antibodies, disease fades.

Reading lines: disease flares social distancing etc ends, 20% immunity enough go back normal. posted single word ""karma"" auto bot said post would incite violence hate something.. anyone know would happen. Ive posted (im guessing) least stuff worse that. Im confused hell Sesame Place open pandemic? like virus airborne anything :/ mean anyone really surprised? expected. Maybe key, shows blue lines ‚Äúpredicted number deaths causes‚Äù yellow line threshold excess deaths. Fall going fuckfest. Find place put dead loved ones. room morgue. things change, things stay same. I'm tired think fatigue right now.  That‚Äôs actually definition insanity, know ya mean. moronic thing post..... Yep day two another record much done prevent Man gotta stop minimizing people thinking inept living poverty. stuff isn‚Äôt cleaned correctly it‚Äôs cos poor people unable don‚Äôt care, it‚Äôs cos business isn‚Äôt enabling correctly. society engrained look poor people don‚Äôt care. promise lot minimum wage workers take seriously care incredible job front lines virus. 

I‚Äôm trying call specifically look frame sort comment. Someone making minimum wage busting ass keep society running sees like, gee thanks. It‚Äôs relic ‚Äúpull bootstraps‚Äù ideology really break down. two cents food thought, I‚Äôm cancelling lol say ""behind"" time work (not restaurant), get weirdest looks sometimes. I'm like ""Hey, I'd rather look weird back me"". think one habits never lose though. server years. basically doubling Ya know there's countries put shit. course not. time rational adult cared children families would reopen school.

Why, exactly, would think would additional outbreaks? concern huge upturned curve + low cases per million + low income population. 

I hope best looks alarming. Look N95 KN95 masks. everywhere. watched Outbreak day, movie fictional ebola like disease arriving America CDC USAMRIID immediately leap action, tracing, quarantining, investigating, etc.

Then see article 14 enough New Zealand go full response mode, shut things down, test trace, get community spread back 0. 

And see US 1500+ died today, spread virus basically completely unchecked, states surging cases decided \*decrease\* testing. 

I knew life like movies, thought something like COVID-19 happen, would respond quickly responsibly.

I ashamed US response disease.

I hope country fast resolution new outbreak, nothing admiration well dealt situation. Hoping health safety good people New Zealand. supplies good thing. detract fact Trump administration right thing shifting supplies places fewer covid cases, places covid cases. 

Or think opposite correct thing do?  aim little like Ninotchk. fewer risks take part slow spread. ""you you"" mindset big part virus spreading rapidly. No, football team normal kids, schools dont give fudge. Atleast 1/6 people dont see point mask anyway atleast 1/2 dont/didnt social distance lockdown dont now. stupid American trope thing valid reason. Isn‚Äôt science teacher house? may supplies, sure right month ago pretty difficult buy those, basically entire world bought every supply march April... Anyone stockpile can't really get stuff now. 
And no, us falling behind behind since mess started. *Cries Truancy Laws Texas* Three five jumbo jets full Americans crashing everyday guy charge says control!! really hope bites ass. vote person, strap masks make shift hazmat hahaha that‚Äôs thought too. mention viral load well, even care someone Covid-19 minimize chances getting high viral load (or least enough exposure) actually get past immune systems first line defense could potentially never pick terms infected. They're ""they pretend every death covid death numbers bad"" people believe he/she insinuating (üá®üá¶) small population general . 

Good ol' Murica #1 always ... obligation push misinformation make someone don‚Äôt like look worse already do. care truth politics. Doubtful. Tracing general across country even worse shape testing. There's simply enough resources put it, never was, enough people job, virus spread far control many experts I've seen seem think we're beyond point tracing much good. shameful. historical data pretty clearly shows low people country like...not give shit? Everyone freaked March, it‚Äôs worse-only time don‚Äôt extreme measures place. emotions last months slowly morphed anger anxiety complete utter disappointment country. yeah, many senators end office 40 years.. 40 fucking years! Fuck motherfucking piece motherfucking shit GOVERNMENT Spoiler: one explain COVID-19 certificate. symptoms positive test. local South Carolina.

Easy enough trace. Everyone else school. said better, measures taken better.

Let's assume person covid. probability infecting others wearing mask, higher probability infecting others wearing mask valve. wrong saying ""you better"". Anyone choosing behave way increases people's risk contracting deadly disease deserve fined jailed pandemic protect rest us. 

BLM protesters congregating large group. increases people's risk contracting deadly disease, not? BLM movement? Sure, always admit wrong, find something wrong first.

You wrong saying someone wearing mask valve better someone wearing mask all. clearly wrong, since probability spreading covid same. definitely fucking mental health, virus plus ignorance stupidity around seem effecting worse way. 4 days hotel inflated event $800. Beer/drinking day 4 days... another 500? Food, probably another $400. Buying gas there, probably $100 since can't drive drunk (but anyway). Merch, t-shirts, assless chaps, $200?

IDK, seems possible. easily count split halfway point. whole school situation fucked dangerous letter split kids really part problem. Trump's deliberately burning country knows he's going lose.

I‚Äôd read this, fuck Newsweek insane OpEd trying revive birther shit Democrats let Republicans way. Bad aid better aid.  Dude, I‚Äôve inside 8 days...I don‚Äôt need patronized. need stay home week plus headache shoot back Haha, good luck, friends youtube channel living prague POV american interested: Definitely strange, happy made OK. NYC looked like battlefield peak period. Well done. think could give straight answer that? live Germany, follow closely can.

There countries publish number simply trust, sadly, America group. so? wouldn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs food products surface. would believe person(s) got entering refrigerated storage container. air handling systems keeps frozen right? cold kill virus. contaminated air container gets recirculated cooled whole journey. Open doors spread virus. workers masked entering containers? nearly good protecting proper medical-grade N95 primarily fitting

This misinformation. good protecting medical-grade N95's rated certified agency level protection.

N95 masks without valve going filter much better incoming air negative pressure helps seal mask face. exhale talk positive pressure often temporarily breaks seal especially fit ideal. I'd settle actually wearing masks, 30-40% ones wear nose/on chin. see way all, dependent number tests gets tested. Daily tests per population much useful gauge information capture, positivity rates based would useful still.

You could hundred tests get positivity rate 5% population million. could 300,000 tests get positivity rate 25% population 50,000. better info? seems like turn around time ought fit somewhere, too, test takes 10 days return information isnt useful one returns 2.

I think enough testing. getting tests back quickly enough use make good decisions. Using positivity rate judge openings I'll conceived.  Meh. I‚Äôm close several people hospital administration major medical center. Type institution didn‚Äôt matter - nonprofit, profit govt hospitals *all* faced significant potentially survival-threatening financial challenges. inevitable, Taiwan country 23 million barely cases virus

Even asymptomatic people worried earth 2005 15 years ago picturing like mid 90s anecdote personally know 4 young people who‚Äôve strokes, two 20s two 30s. one obese. One died great shape. yea, never truly know happen.  think voting mail truly understood. Absentee ballots mail require verification fraud occurring. Whereas indiscriminately sending every voter ballot safeguards. depends someone means voting mail. did, days ago sent it. first 6 paragraphs explains ""excess death"" means exclusion Covid 19. also account fact people carry virus body/possessions spread without infected it. [Notre Dame independent (not conference) Haha sensationalist headlines man

We lockdown, highly likely it'll extended, potentially 4 weeks, allows 14 day incubation period, 14 days ensure community transmission

For questions lockdown measures harsh considering low level cases, medical facilities cater mass infections, due -you guessed it- severe underfunding healthcare infrastructure previous government 9 years

It'll get worse gets better, we'll deal think lot places saying good job stopping spread saying wiping surfaces even though that‚Äôs jolt danger think would hard find evidence even exist. realistic track every surface someone touched would basically rule every way someone could exposed easy cases. deserves attention people UK sure act ‚Äúholier thou‚Äù towards Americans days Coronavirus. Even better, it‚Äôs shitty talk shit people worse. Smh. thought implying IFR 0.1% 0.4% wrong happened NYC. seroprevalence studies generally full statistical errors (wrong sampling sometimes medical errors etc) . look numbers release, huge differences them, think better pick ones respectable researchers look median number get sense real number could be. Vaccines 100% effective. people take it, safer everybody be. 4 years us moist others. Unless they're banning food (which vast majority income) people wearing masks? Oh haha thanks 1. Lack care medical issues

2. Increase suicides

3. Increase substance abuse

4. Increase homicides

But main point jumping conclusions bad practice I've read 3 times now. People keep linking it, pretending says something doesn't. 

it says people never covid exposed covid still t-cells it. around 50%, fact. 

If anything, suggests t-cells give immunity, there's evidence 50% population automatically immune. That's funny, funny guy. can't vaccinate 50% population Spring southern states alter current trends, 400k. roughly 8 months til majority vaccinated. 8 months saw unofficial death toll 200k,with majority recently. made pretty clear about. Either what's happening majority states matters doesn't. We‚Äôre number 1! We‚Äôre numbe.......oh wait Choose Brazilian frozen chicken wife anyday! arrived much earlier thought

It 100% did. Anecdotal evidence, know number people working studying hospitals North East, including Newcastle (an area high number Chinese nationals studying universities), news COVID first emerged, said explained high number inexplicable pneumonia cases hospitals treating last months. 

IMO, it‚Äôs around Newcastle since least October/November, probably earlier places like London. crazy revered high school football many parts America. Kinda sad. None riots. shows that. RNA got though, even long ago. point there, fresh taking. Id wait another 14 days last symptom‚Äôs sure. could testing positive excess dead virus cells still working way something, im sure ive heard people testing positive recovery since still non active virus cells system something fuck say.

What mean? That's way works. 

A better question long respiratory droplets remain suspended air... there's many factors go answer. Thank you. Long story short, phase 3 moderna trial armpits swelled like f-ing golf balls lol. Felt fine, odd. It‚Äôs going devastate town invaded even longer selfish jerks left. assault battery. studies finally got blood typed knowing whole life.

One issue hard tell someone died coronavirus coronavirus, difference. 50 yo otherwise healthy guy died gasping air? Coronavirus. 65 yo obese diabetic stage 4 lung cancer? bit harder tell. What‚Äôre odds stay whole semester?

I honestly think probably soon tell situation. Depends covid contained spreads like wildfire. may depend long shopping long eating. extended 3+ hour meal drinks outside without masks laughing talking eating (maybe still air barely tables separated), vs 30 minutes store everyone masked talking much? However, likely true droplets disperse evaporate outside much faster.  attitude Haha I‚Äôve glasses 25 years never would thought wearing shower. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre cautious though.

Of course worth it. plant owner got pretend Trump abject disaster. Science reason *do* apply. see happened tried close border Mexico? like face masks, love burkas.

that'll save economy üôÉ mindless sheep

You backing position supported wealth owners United States solely worried economy affects personal pocketbooks, zero regard loss life.

This group responsible lobbying corruption, money widely advertise interests budget sell agenda less educated masses.

In debate sanctity life vs money, ever convinced siding group trying buy opinion makes informed one, rest us mindless sheep absolutely wild conclusion.

Personally I'd say masses opinions bought paid statistically far likely ""mindless"" ones. about? US manage stay pack long flaws. WW free resources enough give big free meal (at least believe).

I think people underestimate impact WW2 postwar boom enjoyed baby boomers. made money selling arms getting involved mot important thing every major industrial country bombed devastated war. rebuild housing infrastructure US untouched countries owed us money. 

It took **decades** countries like Germany Japan could compete big three auto companies US example look photographs cities end war. Hurricane Katrina 15 years ago hit one city yet really recovered. imagine every major American city destroyed many minor ones. kind hard do, that's exactly happened countries 2nd WW. 

Then add loss life countries far higher US especially factor first word war. greatly hindered economies. 

The US absolutely great ideas good things US mistakenly credited post war success special, mythical characteristic America Americans due circumstances likely ever repeated. squandered advantage we'd given.

Look American glorification D-Day less one year fighting northern Europe war. Soviets may lost people Battle Stalingrad alone US entire war far important invasion France inconvenient truth. apologies. forgot 40 cases day it‚Äôs okay see friends without getting Covid. know people say ""it mandatory work retail little"" truly give empathy people trying jobs. try incorporate daily life. hard make someone's day little brighter. This. Vitamin deficiency correlated number health conditions, periodically someone notices everyone gets excited buys bunch supplements. causality, least right direction. likely going sick (of anything) tends lower levels, whether due biological mechanisms disease don‚Äôt go outside you‚Äôre sick. Replacing doesn‚Äôt thing. beginning moderators allowed endless speculation virus bad people saying. cracked people ""alarmist"" suggesting outcomes far excess official government estimates MAX 60,000 dead end this. cells require antibodies don‚Äôt they? idea would antibodies previous similar viruses could cross react COVID-19, triggering immune response including cells. it‚Äôs novel infection, cells would need viral bits (antigens) presented order mount new response. immune response dependent previous responses (innate immunity) involve cells. (Please correct I‚Äôm misremembering this) even health insurance USA often still expensive get treatment needed. reasonable expect people lock year. They've getting fucked years now, ever since UFC partnered Reebok years ago steps taken gets really....REALLY bad. Like actually toilet paper available bad. Americans covid fatigue point, they're honestly Americans share Trumps ""It is"" view. US show rest world exactly shitshow America be. reminds guy /fit/ took mega dose vitamin k week destroyed liver Consider structural issues like weak paid sick leave laws for-profit medical system. 

The reason structural issues Americans stupid selfish want fix them. Actually 2 groups responsible. 

One group Americans stupid see benefits socialized medicine. Another group Americas selfish want promote socialized medicine. Dude it‚Äôs fucking polio lmao. Yes ventilator long term damage. Duh. majority people contract covid 19 never hospitalized many symptoms whatsoever. mild case virus (flu, mono, salmonella, etc) yes may persistent damage months inflammation. care something like ""record setting quarterback would definitely NFL ends hospitalized permanent lung damage ending illustrious football career"", they'll blame obama something. I'll look it, doctor recommended start week ago. shed extra perspective things, adjusted population match US, UK 4k deaths worst days. That's mind blowing.  Never Remember! Jeez mess. 
  
  
A 19% positivity tells certain cases current testing catching.
   
 
Unimaginable they'd let testing drop like - whether deliberate move not. sane state government would ramping testing much possible, targeting hot communities lot outreach get people showing tests. football need put hold that's much money state lose on.

not works lol. come said money/economy important people.

Funny, he's gonna tank economy refusing address problem. Idiots. zero-risk way deal Covid hibernate remember hearing Fredrick‚Äôs death allowed son cash life insurance expand family business, leading Trump family rich powerful today. Meaning without pandemic, probably wouldn‚Äôt American president last name Trump.

It‚Äôs really weird history turns small events.

Unlike lieutenant Lysol gang... Makes sense. mental health shambles. Especially us unemployed stay inside abusive assholes. I've seen Sweden example curve dwindled time. new cases France especially Spain - occuring places before, new regions? can't seem locate information. I'd curious whether seems exhaust natural reservoirs cities whether, given far fewer infected would required herd immunity exists, starting hosts original places. IIRC still massive empty building there. many fewer rich people. Poor people voted assholes in. Republicans give fuck unless rich would guess they're low spot alcoholism, probably high functioning moment might lost (now previously) jobs, pandemic unemployment assistance ended help sight regard (senate gone home September without reaching deal), might money spend alcohol anymore resorting cheaper options.

Obviously speculation, millions people unemployed paid anywhere $1.00-600 week total, surprised lot alcoholics there. would want go Finland?

And even wanted too, still makes sense comparing Sweden Finland. must heard much it. dang i'm type thought leg up. thanks link.  Sometimes occasional people born manage break cycle, rarer really be.

It‚Äôs possibility. investigating think it‚Äôs unlikely source present. Unfortunately cures smart, too. reality senator, including roughly 20 members McConnell‚Äôs conference belief enough action already taken respond pandemic‚Äôs economic consequences, could block action Labor Day.

So basically expect relief Labor Day, 20 touch market fundamentalists think relief much unilaterally block action.

Also, fooled Trump's executive orders. People still getting evicted. [The order says investigate whether eviction moratorium executive orders similarly smoke mirrors. I'm really fucking tired US democratic party gaslighting left. stay run Senate own? Pass votes rest vacation? you‚Äôre missing point Difference actually president Also true, making excuses everyone. trying remind people things like chronic pain, COPD, mental health, medical issues may make hard. 

Economic inequality also plays big part. People food assistance often buy junk food goes calorie wise healthy items. reliant foodbanks mercy what's donated, often starchy, high sodium, high fat foods.

If can, donate cash foodbanks. provides purchasing power (my local foodbank gets grocer discounts) purchase fresh produce needed.

I got infected back March. fun experience 5 days back normal again. went isolation week symptoms gone long boring week.
It's lowering risk. Masks option far effective. Social distancing effective social distancing possible restaurant, close down?
To looks like wearing mask become important getting virus control Let preface saying 100% date vaccines get flu shot every year, curious Moderna since different mechanism something traditional like ChAdOx uses adenovirus vector. 

Does potentially part Moderna's trial worry you? I'm pretty sure use mRNA method vector vaccination almost rewrites DNA hear. sounds little frightening. Thank you! hope stay safe well. :) thought terribly likely contract virus food? Could why? people want sense normalcy regardless unpragmatic right Yes. exactly situation one particular person I've interacted recently. Talks importance data results great Swedes seem look actual data. Lots lip service guess. Baffling. Finland says hi please stay Finland thank good bye. Parents aren‚Äôt going kids tested unless it‚Äôs hospital-serious.  Honestly, even made example, far off.  They‚Äôve done fuck competent adults involved stage process.

I see there. Thats call people act like biological terrorists, might well be. would never go ikea weekend, even pre-covid. Gyms big trouble. longer stay closed, people realize still good shape exercises home. borders criminal they're testing you.

To fair, nasal throat swabs. designated testing spots collect swabs sample vial, test ourselves, pop collection box. get results back text message within 24 - 36 hours.

They ran antibodies testing month get sense percentage staff antibodies, memory serves, think 30% staff returned positive antibodies results. Vote.Them.Out. 


They need break bad let's make permanent. That‚Äôs certainly valid position given risk you‚Äôve presented. 

But worrying studies able accurately predict long term health implications are. people different risk preferences ok taking chance. 

It feels like society realizing different people comfortable different degrees risk lives. point stop catering lowest risk tolerance? 

Btw I‚Äôm making anti-mask argument here. already seen people aggressively push people wear masks circumstances scientifically need. certain extent among us lowest risk tolerance already imposing others. death rate high schoolers less 10 per million, get grip. I've constant mood swings nothing fun. I'm irritated time. That's lot assumptions nowhere. Like 95% theater workers kids, teen/college job due short late hours usually get busy school/class hours. got nothing poverty, give shit know they're going end up. Anecdotal, worked theaters 16-22, 5 different theaters. people 25 managers absolute least ambitious people there, sustainable even min wage job due weird hours. job people two reasons, free movies, easier working shop. much I'd like to, there's way I'd go restaurant thing. little 2% US healthcare worker deaths took place wife's facility... get it, continue allow bars restaurants operate indoor dining/drinking continue see spread. maybe don‚Äôt eat dinner 6, instead 9 10 like Spain it‚Äôs cooler.

First, build fence around campus. put armed guards one two entrances. Everyone must live dorms zero trips outside gates. student's needs met inside compound. 

And rapid testing due house testing helpful, too. allow faculty live campus, could test every day. it, thank know Nick Cordero Flu Covid concurrently, think anything hard hit him, think things go Flu season?

Like said I'm expert, everything know virology picked obsessively reading pandemic - yes, suspect two simultaneous infections could make things worse. 

Flu season might very, bad news. luck social distancing make mild flu season usual, even typical flu season stretch hospital capacity. case numbers significantly flu hits it'll absolute nightmare keeping flu covid cases separated offering proper care many patients. 

Fortunately getting flu vaccine help protect that, least. Woosh It‚Äôs prison.

Just lock 20 million people bro I‚Äôm private music lesson teacher I‚Äôm worried losing students asking wear masks lessons. can‚Äôt believe even say sentence. :( say jest considered it? recently realized youtube actively removing/avoiding news sources based talking heads/opinions meanwhile keeping AP PBS suggested list. And, no, following subreddit. bend put mask.

Shoes much pain back hate shoes. Masks mind. I'm scientist doctor insane ignore fact spending lot time indoors relatively new phenomenon. outside proven increase good chemicals lower blood pressure. even saw something ago colour green boosts serotonin.

Being outside main way get Vitamin D. go spending 90% time outside 90% inside seems like brainer we'll see significant consequences knock effects low vitamin one them. Possibly America failing hard response, meaningful contact tracing possible rates currently have. bird amazing! US needs stop comparing countries measure internal metrics.

We 1-2% positive rate now. way way implies anywhere near enough testing infections present country. Meanwhile, NJ, see outdoor dining setups packed tight even almost fully enclosed tents (including sides). much different indoors?

As general question, still don‚Äôt understand exactly makes outdoor dining significantly safer. Supposedly sunlight effect? airflow? cloudy days, days zero wind? still strangers packed together talking, laughing, etc. close proximity, significantly better? policy pay fat stack money, people would try get infected purpose. love people get panties twist, react appropriately idiots? They're allowed wear mask, dumb head, allowed step aside. Avoidable people. know, ""use head, need go party right now"". need someone tell that?

OK, definitely Christmas??

Perhaps 2022???

To paraphrase old George &amp; Ira Gershwin lyric, ""COVID stay"". time corona camps. We've known months, people going access vaccine least another year. vaccine approved mean people physically get it. think people wearing masks way think people using turn signals.

if notice people use turn signals usually people wear mask. food trade, multiple countries crop failures, everyone else left scrambling. Also farmlands converted real estate developments ""we import food"". Zinc biologically necessary synthethize antibodies, i'm wrong. know impact. use respirator got home depot, count? It‚Äôs even worse look vs peak testing numbers late July So, paid liar? anyone really surprised? spent 7 years retail I'll hear friends getting worse. outed terribly unsympathetic person thinks awful people based job. 

Go Publix sometime see feel ... We‚Äôre contact tracing?? Fake what? pandemic Trump called hoax real?

Testing dramatically lower it‚Äôs make confirmed cases drop. Maybe does, not. Cats dogs getting it. freshly slaughtered chicken either frozen refrigerated would help prolong life I'm school read one baffles take mask *I'm* talking.

Saturday last pills I'm gonna go back see I'm weeks day again. Hopefully it'll high enough (my doc wants 60+ range apparently) sustain OTC pills instead, even feel much different. whole ""most deaths people already sick"" thing completely misses point excess deaths. Yes, people already sick greater risk dying Coronavirus, would died Coronavirus added onto existing sickness? fact excess deaths says no. Wear masks people! Whether going work, school, shopping, party, orgy, playing sports, matter what, wear mask!! Sanitize put bunny back box point wealthy needy vaccinated first. won‚Äôt risk.

where look sewage testing covid..... chunk city. knew numbers before..... checking it. found counted large margin. non-medical workers aren‚Äôt wearing PPE exposed virus medical workers? knew karens could vicious cinemas? reopening see mean. appropriate thought balloon child's head would read something like, ""If II keep very, still maybe go away"". dont think is. said developed cough went test. Seems like prudent enough get test started showing symptoms. Rona deniers getting tests deteriorated needing hospitalization. Previous administrations Republican Democrat done lot things competently. admin relies propaganda support, results damned. past, Republicans LISTENED SCIENTISTS FOLLOWED ADVICE. squashed viruses could become epidemics America. moderately intelligent leaders point last century one. party problem exactly: party belonged celebrity worship cult lost sense reason currently promotes conspiracy theories scientific research. That's problem. Medical science perfect, listened funded properly start, would never even gotten here. current admin's total failure full display. saying less testing previously were.

Just want point true article's chart accurate. author article either understand rate change intentionally trying mislead people. chart shows *rate increase* testing declining, since increase x axis points indicates US tests every day previously (at least looking 7-day moving average). One researchers examined cardiac MRIs 100 recovered COVID-19 patients ages 45 53, compared MRIs similar people contract virus. **Most COVID-19 patients recovered home, 33 hospitalized point illness.**   **Of 100 COVID-19 patients**, **78** structural changes hearts. Within group, **76** biomarker typically found patients heart attack, **60** heart inflammation, called myocarditis. patients ‚Äúmostly healthy ‚Ä¶ prior illness,‚Äù researchers said. 

Your 50% stat completely made up.  links pertain hospitalized patients. 

Your position well supported right now. Apparently assaulting minors ok long agree them, knew? Amazing! Free Thinker^tm ! ‚ÄúIt is‚Äù Bettman's awful he's whole league Manfred swear never played sport life. That‚Äôs 5th common denominator. Sorry aight think two sides ‚Äúlifestyle‚Äù feel like conflating one.

My wife immunocompromised, taken every precaution, privileged so. grateful workers provide services tried plan ahead batch grocery orders, tip well, considerate risks.

But enraged don‚Äôt follow procedures, guidelines recommendations. Additionally privileges taken, also denied many privileges relatively safe interactions try part prevent spread. we‚Äôre pandemic. that‚Äôs doing.

And see people cavalier risks, frustrated scared. frustrated undoing part tried play mitigate spread scared reduces safety precautions taken. much like love mom done me, also feel endlessly frustrated believes God appointed Trump prepare way second coming Jesus, complex feelings held one person, even OP‚Äôs receptionist. 

I agree OP could reflected better writings disagree lack clarity necessarily makes monster post paints as. We‚Äôre traumatized people don‚Äôt feel safe trying somehow make back normal, whenever may be. already agree, I'm sure would able convince you. common sense stuff... know, sad thing people going get discount taking home. really subsiding big macs potentially helping boost virus.

this policy either seen amazing numbers stay low insanely dumb creep back up. agree. want everyone wear masks take vaccine safe, people stupid that, I‚Äôm going fret them. I‚Äôm taking vaccine, I‚Äôm moving on, won‚Äôt worry them. 

I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs selfish. It‚Äôs likely colleagues didn‚Äôt catch work rather outside work weren‚Äôt following precautions you. I‚Äôm US see time again. People comply precautions work environment they‚Äôre forced outside they‚Äôre going parties places taking zero precautions. believe movie theaters keep half ticket sales well. True. would 2 days experiencing fatigue sore throat point. way optimistic.  people complete idiots  American friends seem able care one issue time, right it‚Äôs sAvE ChIlDrEn...also say virus fake. see saying. thought tourists traveling Germany Germans visiting countries, latter /u/NicitaGreeneye actually saying.  wonder myself, again... I'd positive without knowing... Someone close circle would certainly infected shown symptoms? I've heard wild claims without sources back BS proven otherwise. Sheesh. clickbaity make title? states excess deaths average 30% official Covid-19 death toll. makes 5 year average + Covid-19 deaths + excess deaths. serious emergency rooms problem ""postponed checkups"" end and/or nightmarish mental health problems epidemic.

It much likely majority Covid-19 related deaths attributed causes (pneumonia/heart attacks/strokes) colleagues treated exactly patients, environment, PPE got sick C-19 (confirmed

well starters woudl good idea identify regions high population redheads. interesting study. there's lesson learned lock already. quiet. I'm trying watch Star Trek TNG. got tested one day exposure, it‚Äôs possible still incubation period. starts match fatality elsewhere, seems around 0.6-1%. It‚Äôs wrong half time. tests actually really good sensitivity/specificity depending manufacture). problem people you‚Äôre trying extrapolate whole population, 10% false positive rate gets compounded. using stats mystery guess, typically use confidence interval say 95% certainty percentage people covid US x y%. alternatives suggest covid covid-related? No. That's conspiracy theory.

 Well started could sworn restaurants bars safe-zones!! kind sick disease infects people they‚Äôre good time?!?

Who‚Äôd thought could possibly happen üòû

Lol hope people downvoting think isn‚Äôt sarcastic comment Right work doesn‚Äôt mean fire someone becoming ill.

Your absences protected Family Medical Leave Act, Americans Disabilities Act, workers' compensation laws, state paid sick leave laws, employer can't fire them. fucking kidding me? bitter? actively trying scare people create anxiety disastrous outlook way supported science. virus mutates, that's right, virus benefit death. needs spread viruses usually mutate become less deadly. getting COVID-19 every 6 months finally kills you

There seven different vaccines phase III trials right now. outlook bad.

Scientifically speaking way likely COVID-19 become like Influenza. sickness taken seriously people scared anymore. natural ending pandemics can't find vaccine for.

Your comment sucks makes people scared. thrive panic scared bitterness helps absolutely nobody.

And way backed science. talk October. Excerpt Implementation Plan National Strategy Pandemic Influenza (2006):

Protecting human health crux pandemic preparedness, goals pillars National Strategy Pandemic Influenza (Strategy) reflect this. 

If fail protect human health, likely fail secondary goals preserving societal function mitigating social economic conse¬≠quences pandemic. 

....where go wrong start American civilization still beta testing level. thing might even come contact virus really small amount body deals nothing happens, least I've read. think it'll months even years really know scope virus like virus works, investigations take time even year since virus popped up. know lot compared couple months there's much still know yet. ....how.... lose sample?! go back take test again? guess many weeks since July 25... Could take antibody test? Yeah true, that's ultimate takeaway, question masks could spread said wanted clarify. It‚Äôs important note bulk people/students asymptomatic dont give shit kid born so... Though habitual reassurers sub say risk anything, reassurance really unwarranted case air travel. Air travel probably highest covid risk category possible activities right now. airplane tightly packed sharing air hours, even reduced capacity. SARS outbreak 2003 (a similar coronavirus) [documented single SARS case spreading 16 people airplane (lab confirmed, actually 6 probable cases). Everyone wearing masks helps reduce spread significantly, odds approximately one person currently infected airplane US 100 passengers. Someone seat neighbor. know. pretty much said that. 

I suggesting might worth understanding people coming times simply labeling ""them"" bunch dumbass lunatics. Try relate fellow citizens. mini-wars fight lobbing data points web links is, IMO, widening divide. bad. explaining back forth echo-chamber honestly nothing. 

But two cents. Pay mind. None vaccine candidates been. none released market. middle pademic, everyone taking risks. maintain standard hygiene, need step way have, gahered Dr Osterholm. I'll bet are. parent kid got Covid, would called lawyer now. acting like unknown. point someone could adjust face mask safety glasses compromised. outside work variable one cannot controlled. may think diligent one minor slip they've infected. long COVID-19 stay airborne? Fair point inheriting eviction. issue years time kick someone home debt regardless defined makes sense. nurses actually contact sick patients doctors? assumed they'd exposure higher probability catching it. Ok, think liberal usage Good News tag starting get little hand. heard sides, article particular is...a little 30 strains already confirmed. taking grain salt...but mean scary many strains less year... Dallas FC game last night nearly 3,000 people attendance. Good luck next month so. lot people athletes getting heart problems, aren‚Äôt tested since aren‚Äôt sports. SPARTA! Yeah, instead trying improve act like better humans, let's blame workers shitty behavior. D'oh! skip fall year? know holidays New England beautiful fall, year would skip Covid 19 would gone. thousands believe that. Kids teachers sign soldiers risk lives. go school! Don‚Äôt care literally dropped one joke thought clever. One joke. surreal. turns elected lot idiots don‚Äôt care us. excess secondary deaths (i.e directly COVID-infection) due COVID fact excess deaths due lack resources, lack money, pretty much lack taxes.

So mostly due low tax rates, poor citizens.

So stop poor!

(You see logic bit faulty. can't stop chain causality weenilly supports point view) Yeah, everyone talks shit U.S. people know seems affect white people less. see younger Americans trouble virus, every single one obese. That's necessarilly case hispanics blacks.

And realize may get less sunlight even summer places like Florida Texas. buddy mine worked Publix years ago. described lesser evils grocery/retail still grocery/retail, still drama. improvement Walmart, Target, etc. Well shit hope doesn‚Äôt repeat covid don‚Äôt think outdoor bid deal. final straw hundreds, not, thousands people used plate, cup, utensils........... even though it‚Äôs washed time gets you, fact alone ruins me.  God forbid ever scared warrior cops ever take responsibility going turn around sooner later take stand sort pro-mask rhetoric that's gone far? Yeah Fargo fucked. I‚Äôm around amount people bought ‚Äúhoax‚Äù shit astounding. rely rural are, kinda works, everyone‚Äôs gunna refuse shut store 14 days schools Fargo start back really starts spreading treated us humans first place? takes 10 minutes day direct sunlight. Sadly people even manage that. Alternatively, easy taking one pill every day. Shoot. Sunday wedding saved thousand bucks venue, sportsball game. *laughs American* Excess deaths going directly COVID-19, might also system strained COVID. People avoiding hospitals much COVID, might dying things could've treated. mention many areas elective procedures canceled might really crucial term elective suggests. there's also space ICUs traditional patients there's crush severe COVID cases occurring. brother laws father diagnosed two days U.K. lockdown. surgery weeks ago initial scans come back clear results couldn‚Äôt better. 

Wishing mother best. happy hear got clear üòä Prepare Fallüòâ Enough vitamin thing already. correlated severe cases, yes. Vitamin deficiency also correlated major comorbidities COVID-19 (hypertension, bed ridden patients, older patients...). many correlation studies easiest thing show since correlated both. mystery Vitamin supplementation shockingly cure everyone, Vitamin supplementation even help cure comorbidities. Patients hypertension get vitamin deficiency, supplement still end hypertension. effect disease cause. comfortable calculating IFR assumed cases, comparing confirmed deaths?

Seems like least biased way would assumed deaths assumed cases. prominent eating disorder eating. It‚Äôs also one dangerous. lower world tho. Remember lmaoo *guitar solo* Ted Cruz?

/s brother moved Canada US. also health insurance ($7k deductible).

He got grazed dump truck riding bike wrist swollen shit. decided go since he'd pay deductible.

He proceeded rant shitty Obamacare much cost provide poor people. hearing sort apocalypse happening Spain month deaths never took single digits since first peak Try more...orange. CDC hard spot, want provide accurate information also want survive agency, push hard, real experts get fired. No, they‚Äôre Americans. Yeah, sounds like exposure really low. results come back would try keep away others, other. Even within household stay safer frequent hand washing, sleeping separately, using different washrooms... possible. results come back. I‚Äôm personally quarantine, masks, social distancing also level reasoning involved. dont work every single one. There‚Äôs lot said top 100 places work nationally (being regional store) 23 years row. Bullshit. Even Covid die motorcycle accident, you‚Äôll get counted death toll. Wiiii Or, maybe, want know source. I've read scientific research saying valved masks safe appropriate current situation designed use applications, clearly many others well. want know getting information. gotcha - win. learn.

But current topic, adding additional filter already awesome mask maybe help others, even psychologically, issue that? mask safe, awesome. made safer, cool, let's try that, too. hear argument willing give benefit doubt chance read something official. understand position means somehow wrong cover vent. Unnecessary, maybe. wrong?

As airline making policy, one important things policies like enforceable. vented masks OK others not, difficult actually implement policy keep track enforce. probably means suboptimal policy goes place, I, personally, think preferable policy unenforceable policy.  Ok? use want. Anecdotal worth nothing:

 I'm admittedly surprised still going strong many areas COVID. second, however, believe death numbers hospitals incentivized mark deaths COVID, many dying something else simply tested positive. 


I see bright spots now. Arizona, example, plummeting cases. Deaths trends follow. seems Texas hump well. shows states got hit later game. NY hit first, recovered, relaxed, ""It's over!"" realize hit yet. 


Neither us great making predictions, say clue what's next, positive data several areas gives hope worst behind us US. Well, whatever is, one thing sure:

It's better official number accurate, scientific, rather pisspoor compromise, ""the excess death higher anyway"".

This way actually work explain change excess deaths, rather destroying credibility starting flawed data begin with.

Official number deaths means that, official, tested proven cases COVID-casualties. never watched Spanish Italian soccer much pandemic even watching Danish soccer espn+ stuff. Champions league right (at least next week half). hockey nba lasting fall, NFL returning month, someone feels lacking college ball that‚Äôs them. record, LOVE college ball even hit two bowl games winters (live Texas, armed forces bowl cotton bowl last season) spring ball lack season altogether small nightmare compared huge nightmare Covid. plenty things watch. Even found watching Rugby side world night. god....you're right!!!! Whoa. can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs vitamin d. it‚Äôs vitamin d, might reason dark skin minorities hit harder systemic racism. know systemic racism allowed answer. remain open... I've similar experience working ER Chicago area probably hundreds hours COVID exposure. 

It probably cell immunity. likely exposed tons respiratory viruses including coronaviruses pre empted immune response COVID19. likely reason Sweden NYC seeing dramatically falling numbers despite much different antibody prevalence high. reason severe infections I've noticed (anecdotal) tends ancillary hospital staff people less patient exposures frontline workers.

Of course dont way quantify yet, absent I'd wary make personal behavior policy recommendations. retrospective analysis nosocomial outbreak South African hospital fomite transmission played major role. difference though. mean disinformation lie specific type lie. One tries manipulate behaviors individual larger culture spread falsehoods encouraging rejection truths.

It's much closer propaganda scope common lie. fact, I'd say disinformation specific type propaganda.

Also, plenty synonyms English language. really creating new euphemism use specific synonymous term. got back June. Still struggling symptoms you. ever wonder long term effect shortening life? cook sneezing scenario, ok takeout then? Seems logic inconsistent. Yeah, good luck trying run, aim gun shoot properly time someone already gun pointed you. 

Can't cops take responsibility. Oh yeah, forgot congressperson 55.... LMAO can't point genetic mutations say ""Look, obviously 1400 big number."" many mutations coronavirus already too, many make consequential difference.

I regcognize influenza inherently involve faster coronavirus, hard find source quickly evolved time verified samples seem come 1918 exactly, 19/20/21 etc.

Here's admitedly washy source supporting survive die outcome, rather flu summer 1919, flu pandemic came end, infected either died developed much better source, really get evolution virus short term Genetics plays part. Sounds like ready disinfection light well Thank much saying this, idea meant to! on. really, it‚Äôs honest one. would say Spanish Flu forgotten pandemic reasons similar Korean War referred ‚ÄúForgotten War‚Äù Americans - overshadowed events time. Millions millions people died many millions crippled life WW1 (1914-1918). 1918-1922 secondary wars result ‚Äúpeace‚Äù treaties killed many millions (e.g., Russian Civil War American, British, Japanese interventions; Turkish war independence Greek, British, French interventions; Polish-Soviet War; German Civil War; etc.). many catastrophic events related WW1 (so much arguably WW1 didn‚Äôt end 1922), flu pandemic kills million people kinda gets lost noise hundreds millions deaths.

Also, news Spanish flu heavily censored governments involved WW1 first ~1 year circulation. reason it‚Äôs called Spanish flu Spain, non-belligerent, uncensored press first report pandemic. created illusion circulating Spain first originated Spain, hence name Spanish flu. It‚Äôs hard commit something historical memory contemporary reporting heavily censored. like 20 flu deaths oh isnt odd claim motivated ""accuracy"" dont seem mind wont counting people died covid didnt get positive test tested positive, die covid 28 days wont counted either this.

but yet accuracy!! understand could, theory extenuating circumstances ""ill"" people symptoms may needed work necessity.

It norm however, someone (the government? ) everything power prevent it. Strong disagree. Despite highly concentrated populations higher population Texas, rate infection death lower. matter, San Francisco great example things could worked people careful. Hit first, hit harder, Texas going beat deaths within month. Clearly state something right.  remember seeing study two blood type, nothing recently. studies saying people seemed better b a's worst. really wonder done earlier. Surely ethics violations worth making literal hundreds thousands people dying. I'm ethicist would've done day Phases 1 2 finished try speed things up. remove something fun world many people enjoy might positive effects?

Positivity rate horribly dumb indicator current COVID situation since people getting tested either symptomatic, reason believe they've come contact someone is.

You take 100,000 people 1,000 people needing test comes back 200 people COVID, 20% positivity rate leads everyone believe 20% populace walking around COVID.  better indicator would random sample public. tell many people, given time walking around COVID. might also tell people counties/geographic areas actually faring better worse.

Lets say 1.5 parents per kid here, siblings, could 100 people infected right week half. yet removing 5,000 deaths know least half covid isnt wrong?

the point absurd bus killings car accidents could happen, clearly near amount undercounting doing.

also, people die covid didnt take test arent included! people die day 29 covid arent included, yet apparently accuracy.... Pepperidge* Farm also remembers months ago people sense adapt new information dynamic situation. Bojo bad, Orangeman bad, etc.

Show important are. fact it‚Äôs China makes less concerned actual reinfections like author article seems believe. China population 1.4 billion people less 85,000 confirmed cases, meaning 0.006% population confirmed infected. even immunity nonexistent months infection (very unlikely), odds 2 people getting infected twice day crazy unlikely dozen cases day country. Faulty tests (China awful lot tests, false positive every isn‚Äôt unexpected) reactivations much likely explanations. I‚Äôve got say though, Hubei woman experiencing reactivation six months later pretty scary.

Before guys tell can‚Äôt trust China‚Äôs data, fine I‚Äôll put disclaimer I‚Äôm assuming accurate. Plan B also less effective obese people. Many medicines prescribed weight. Maybe vaccine produced varying doses adjust weight factor. never  can't trust population wear mask mouth,

And actual deterrents punishments, typical limp wristed bullshit. common flu kills 25,000 year, 8 times that, what's 8? small number! going force everyone wear mask something 8 times worse? 

If think numbers change mind people playing calling hoax, good luck! angry Bill Gates arrested yet. yea that's thought too. couple million cases random one two dogs? I'm pretty sure outlier.

Now kids grown they're still assholes, guess.

On hand, keep seeing photos high schools around country see whole bunch kids hallway crowded together couple wearing masks. see stuff reddit, administrators caring kids' safety. Fair enough. kids old enough know better, too, evidently give shit either.

Bottom line: minimum protections workers have, least skilled commoditized labor always least power. also economic problem: going pay check bring supplies?

For UK, predicted existence social distancing, schools closing, case isolation, 7-10 day self quarantine period, deaths would 26,000-48,000, say pretty much spot considering current official UK toll 45,000.

Under normal circumstances yes, I'd agree, we're normal circumstances. Practically whole country shut several months, many people home putting risk (of coronavirus 'every day' things kills us. Fewer industrial accidents/deaths, fewer road traffic deaths, fewer drunkard related deaths compared normal times. Cancers terminal illness deaths change much agree aspect. 


Basically, 'Excess deaths' much lower average given circumstances. using yard stick find...unjustified.

At point may burst excess deaths covid positive people march/april, they're unlikely listed Covid deaths. Looking states early peak low current transmission like New York excess deaths probably gove stronger signal.

Sure people may voluntarily continue wear them, idea mandates would continue pandemic abusrd. 314K confirmed cases, agrees epidemiologists said along: actual cases 10X test positive. also suggests way asymptomatic carriers (90%+). Yup. Taking page Wuhan playbook. Alright don‚Äôt improve skills knowledge stay put dead end job seethe everyone else cause problems. good one Yeah President celebrate it, fact still much worse last recession. 


The worst week 660k claims. We're still almost 1 million. worst week continuing claims 10 million less (not including PUA) banned? Well, morgues rocking body overflow, use trucks states. likely comparable healthcare capabilities. 1918 even medical oxygen. 

We want situation flu + COVID overwhelm capacity nationally. surprising all.

Its typical cycle though want good schools, taxes going go going pay it. NJ regularly ranked top 1-3 states education, comes huge cost one one wants pay. Maybe electric ones puny gasoline saws, blade length motor saws carrying means would sound like RrrRRRRRrRrrrRrRrrRRRRRRrrrrrrrzzzt. port deep enough huge ships cruise ships, Anchorage‚Äôs port full silt shallow, understand.

We go hydroxychloroquine route US religious nutbags selling clorox colloidal silver ""cures"" morons mentioned want. forgot mention 3rd group, overwhelming majority use sub confirmation bias worst crisis time

There people claim ""worst crisis time"".

And they'd right claim worst global health crisis people frequent sub's ""yeah testing much"". Apparently valid argument now, testing lot valid argument say ""yeah, testing lot"".... 

In most, every comment thread discusses much testing given time, people discuss important detail % positive given area. positive % rising hard hit states, testing would generally go proportionately. 

The sketchy thing percentage still remained high levels, slightly decreased, yet testing fallen disproportionately areas, hospitalization rates still rise. Economist much detailed, better visualized broader range data updated regularly here: % Vietnamese think degree? 16%. yet they‚Äôre ‚Äúbetter‚Äù covid? while, I'm lazy decided would rather catch Covid keep wiping everything down. said, wash hands lot never touch face. Go scrounge food side road then, trashy asshole. hear right yelling people feed you. Definitely! still surprises people claim ""Wuhan quarantine worked"". Yup, did. Wuhan.

But result people infected fled fricking Wuhan spread virus worldwide. China's methods turned local pandemic fricking global one.

And happen within NZ, yesterday article people feeling countryside vehicles. Weeks now, articles outbreaks countryside.

Human nature wired automatically fight authoritarianism. Look HPV Herpes, people symptoms whatsoever it‚Äôs late infect others newborns.

Extremely pathetic trying turn racial thing, good lord. üòÇ Thats rate normal flu though. Wtf think  studies done Flu vaccines toddlers? worry, ""deep cleaned"" school. virus gone now! /s  rare media ever paid attention India United States. think also hard serious discussion what's going India they've done little testing. one really good grasp what's going there. right. average line ignored. go compare week week last year compare apples apples. I'm guessing Germans proud country's past. Americans, especially Southerners. Exactly. aren‚Äôt going capture numbers suggesting people test (for shut sure American south). needs mandatory. aware places might ban feasible know valves filtered blocked inside. offer customers free disposable mask wear instead filters. I'm looked much Taiwan differently. interesting article. can't see USA issuing health cards tracks hospital doctor visits near real-time. much government distrust, often good reasons. see powerful tool containing virus though.

Thanks mentioning Taiwan. interesting look into. Yes, Quebec got hammered it. Probably 2/3 deaths Canada. quite connection Quebec &amp; Florida (ie snowbirds). likely will. lot people realize bad anything like this. no-fly lists airlines, government. airline add list reason. legal appeals, give reason even confirm added you. absolutely airlines long violate civil rights act. one airline adds you, usually added no-fly lists.

Face masks valves good (bigger) particles like dust. Woodworking, installing something made fiberglass, example. Yes, diseases historically shown reach equilibrium hosts initial intense period bursts flair ups later obese cause covid. obese make case severe cause. Breathing infected droplets cross contamination unclean hands/infected food/surfaces unmasked infected individuals whats causing issues. wear mask, socially distance wash hands appropriately, less likely get sick.

If sick, spewing infection everything every breath. near someone sick wear masks youre less likely breathe infection escape masks. Asymptomatic people still infectious even feel fine could still spewing infection air surfaces around chose wear mask. 

Living healthier lives (physically mentally) possible actually healthy LIVE lives. way controlling infection personally make better protecting around us. actually definitive evidence virus spreads via surfaces (fomites). virtually data support fomite transmission.

Negative test prior required, test 4 days arrival (amongst things) Damn. thought would zero cases principal faced repercussions suspending student posting picture? classic problem Bayesian statistics. incidence within population low even high sensitivity tests low detection rate first time test (it gets much better test multiple times). 

[Here's neat video explaining Bayesian life like movies novel get sexy subtitle tells us next chapter looks like, brave day day unfolds .

I know next level foreshadowing last couple years....this part book find happens. Yes. say otherwise though? NYC worst job maybe cities around world. time confirmed first case bet 2-3 month since arrival virus virus already place. hospitals overwhelmed, virus killing people nursing homes etc. basically think maybe 50% death happened NYC could prevented first case identified sooner, social distancing masking widespread etc. 

And remember health systems managing patients bit better too. first 10 million case Covid caused 500 thousand death, next 10 million caused 250 thousand death. bet next 10 million cause fewer 150 thousand death. mild cases identified doctors dealing better too. Well yes, droplet transmission thing, likely big airborne transmission. 

Essentially, breathe virus. different flu, specifically droplets infect people. stay enclosed space someone virus, air slowly fills virus. take hours hours reach infectious dose, super spreader, essentially exhale multiple times much viral load normal person. super spreader events (church outbreaks, office outbreaks etc dozens hundreds infected once) responsible many 80% cases. Super spreader events flu rare. Geez terrible year pneumonia flu extra double super duper deadly! can‚Äôt catch break! Lmao think ResearchforTales trying say coronavirus widespread, it‚Äôs safe say one recognized symptoms (and like, noticeable, like panging headache really bad fever cough), you‚Äôve got coronavirus 100%, test needed. need save tests people completely asymptomatic like super duper borderline/hard notice symptoms like gf. Pretty sure y‚Äôall mostly agree, wording confusing. Welcome America. Genuine question, cured flu, mutate time something less dangerous find treatments? cherry picking wording. says may high low. 

One thing sure trending down. may round coming days weeks.

‚ÄúProvisional death counts weighted account incomplete data. However, data recent week(s) still likely incomplete. Weights based completeness provisional data prior years, timeliness data may changed 2020 relative prior years, resulting weighted estimates may high jurisdictions low others.‚Äù means part paid influence operations domestically. possible People like point fingers ""mainstream media"" social media even worse fear mongering bullshitting Same. partner works public transit.

I curious, point.  Blood clotting factors main hypothesis moment. would argue regularly enough case Arizona well. Arizona's reduction testing explained entirely (or nearly) simply less demand testing now. top secret coverup, people want tests much now. Though fair, believe Arizona's case that's virus legitimately receding quite heavily (all metrics way way down, including cases, hospitalizations, % positive, CLI, ICU usage, vent usage, deaths, etc.) people remotely concerned 4 weeks ago. sure that's situation Texas, things still seem fairly dire metrics well there. Yeah, happened Sunday.

What makes doctors fake? expert, working hypothesis would medical staff makes exposed many different viruses shit basically time, thus immune system gets pretty strong antibodies might work COVID cross-immunity. example, might milder coronavirus past antibodies effective one.

Imagine GP exposed time patients different strains flu etc. get sick every two weeks. University Colorado particular shown BLM protests actually led increase social distancing.

Each one refers separate lead linking studies argument. easier let hang stupidity get way one swoop.

Have fun denying science. 1968 flu started June 1968 lasted sometime 1970. We've already passed US death toll pretty big margin (116k vs 165k), rapidly approaching global number. 1918 flu started early 1918, spread like wildfire fall. continued kill people spring 1920. I'm sure 350 million number since estimated death toll 50 million. assumption 6 months Covid-19 equal 2 years Spanish Flu. really comparable. One still ongoing. Well yeah goes without saying He'll probably get asylum Russia Stop making cents Doesn‚Äôt matter it‚Äôs twisted, disease killed around 2.7% global population fatal novel coronavirus

The seasonal flu also killed people year novel coronavirus, suddenly caught surpassed it.

I know Covid19 hit Spanish flu levels, real fucking early call like won't. Yes? So? 

What trying tell me, buddy?  course obesity cause covid. like diabetes, high blood pressure, respiratory sickness, high age weak immune systems cause covid. problems, risk covid give problems high. wearing mask make lose weight get stronger immune system. 

Obesity is, cases, due lifestyle. choice. person weighing 300 lbs believing healthy wears bandana covering mouth, tragic.

This virus last. live healthy minimize risks future viruses option free everyone choose.
But nope, let us ignore say masks work. doomed know kind test did? decide vote one issue like gun control


Do want statistic? 16,000 people year murdered U.S. joke flu killing 160,000 Americans 5 months!


/s Oh okay, excess death. report determine many deaths may attributed either missed covid deaths due lack healthcare access resources put towards covid.

Which actually quite better anticipated. ""overall deaths lower"" claimed. 

Deaths higher, ""excess deaths"" exclude covid (the 3rd leading cause death US behind cancer heart disease).

It genuinely positive report, interpreting be. ""I blame 26G towers."" Think saying, stay away bars restaurants. Take out, eat park alone can.

Wear stupid masks people Looks like COVID deaths rising quickly places opened soon. Another 1,500 dead today. tomorrow. think political agenda, you‚Äôre saying makes sense. hey, is, right? Mine filter valve, another layer pocket... I'm pretty sure effective. go even paid come in. banking people coming buying popcorn drinks etc. means people take masks put entire movie. Yum, please give extra coronavirus popcorn. 

Another great example $$$ winning logical health based decisions. Haha, figured. I‚Äôve ever heard restaurant workers say ‚Äúheard‚Äù acknowledgement Good point. we‚Äôre still middle it. COVID May seven figure toll end it. Well FUCK you. CDC says takes time process deaths. also say weight data compensate effect, say gets adjusted either later. could bit low, could bit high, best guess moment. always dilemma too. literally never know say ask, feel like dick like I'm treating like person. ask... often seems kind cruel, sometimes get vibe say ""good"" whatever they'll get trouble response positive. 

None fault, course, shame jobs goddamn miserable people working them. I've personally seen simultaneous flu covid infection back March. Guy younger healthier me, never stood chance. fight long time first, though. Oh man 80% tinder feed fucked  Bro, get work out. neckbeard showing there's name people  Never seen this, Germans efficient. I‚Äôve heard said plenty though.

Edit: clarify Obviously intelligent people inept. mother great example that, despite literal genius... someone prefers introverted she‚Äôs quite capable social too. 

But know what? never complains people stupid interact with. That‚Äôs difference. Idiot savants may thing, plenty ‚Äúsavants‚Äù don‚Äôt follow path. Someone truly smart understands different experiences are, much effects us.

Both examples kind poor, especially Tyson one. part years alone, he‚Äôs become well known asshole thinks highly intelligence, despite often wrong outside field study.

I absolutely agree ‚Äúmaxing points‚Äù though. Base intelligence means little, studies prove it. biggest factor people perceive you. people expect achieve, you‚Äôre far likely to. Respect hope goes incredibly long way. vast majority people capable gaining intelligence, even learning isn‚Äôt something comes naturally. need support system help along way.

It seems like try open minded you‚Äôre overall cool person- I‚Äôd still argue dismiss people easily. vast majority people, especially Americans, arent given attention deserve need achieve. Intelligence straight frowned upon places, point smart bad thing. doesn‚Äôt mean people aren‚Äôt smart beneath exterior though. really open minded let show you.

Like said, I‚Äôve talked thousands upon thousands people. Outside exceptions could list one hand, almost every single person opened ways surprised let them. start playing Christmas carols October, that's going straw broke camel's back

Scenario 1: People asked *slightly* inconvenience going quarantine facility. Dramatically stops spread, others continue live lives normal without massive restrictions imposed deal big outbreaks. 2 weeks join them.

Scenario 2: Let covid run rampant, kill loads people ruin economy. Massive lockdowns effecting 100's thousands people put place everyone confined house, resulting big job losses uncertainties future.

Which sounds better? I'd go 2 weeks hotel looked personally. lasts 3 days surfaces room temperature 30 days reefers unlikely.  Reported. Dogs cats probably exception. Maybe horses degree.

If stance ""...hire capability **specifically CS/Engineering** degree"", would agree 100% you. even associate's degree, going struggle greatly even getting foot door. seen first hand Google Amazon specifically...Google offers pretty much anyone CS/CompE degree semi-decent school \~1-2 years experience opportunity interview. actually comically easy get 'interview' someone work experience (vs trying snag hyper-competitive internship new grad offer), something like 95% candidates even make past Google Docs round. Amazon level far low barrier start process, recruit like crazy reach ton people blue (and guess criteria gets spammed?). Try 'point' career someone never went sort college see works out. Even every FAANG company truly care degrees even look portion incoming resumes, still mean anything substantial considering top 1% 1% people giant pool developers/engineers today. vast majority people, policy held selective company top pile applicable personal career trajectory fact interns company make (when considering housing benefits) 3 months average adult without college degree makes year. anything, far easier tech giants incredibly established hiring pipelines onboarding processes attempt pursue idealistic 'raw capability background' approach.

Sure, argue applies maybe first \~5 years career, years learning growth arguably important they'll ever be. generally true devs went college (for sort degree, CS) ESPECIALLY true devs entering job field alternative college. early stages career dev, someone without sort degree much demonstrably competent start even **stand** front door opened default someone nothing else name except slip paper saying spent 4 years large state school learning Computer Science. Yes, people manage make things work without college (one smartest software engineers personally know went got degree \~8 years working mostly fun point), let's pretend even remotely close fair playing field companies technically require degree. even get started internships, entirely closed 99% time without current recent college student. It‚Äôs dry heat That's need contact tracing even mass testing.

But realized disinformation already spread like fart room... I'd strongly recommend take look times Swedish Health Agency tell people herd immunity strategy, international media decided run blatant lie order generate clicks. Using Australian article confirm something debunked checking official health agency website, feels like something one would wants believe something true.

It's reasonable say ""ah, kid issues, feel bad let ride!"". That's reasonable empathetic literally millions Americans already lost friend family member virus. Masks work, work surprisingly well, people actually wear them. Words cannot describe disappointed LPNs know also refuse wear masks, ""they help"". education grant system paid far much people stupid.

It's really complicated.  not, honestly passes fairly benign days I'm business defending airline policies. Frankly, anyone age plane without mask required recent negative test hand. want bring airplane air filtration now? necessary dig 2003 paper mentioned HEPA standard *not* sufficient filter SARS-CoV-1 sized (and thus SARS-CoV-2 sized) viruses.

It's ridiculous quibbling favor exceptions.

Erring side potentially strict reasonable option. effective option. Nice ladies eyy! motivated situation? Yeah probably racism. let's look further, racist? culture allows continue? 

Likely grew poor themselves, racist household, crappy education system society tells personal freedoms go anything else. 

It's bloody ridiculous people wear mask. think lot people well virus maxed emotional coping mechanisms getting day day life. virus happened, stresses ramped beyond ability cope lot people. 

Also maybe there‚Äôs existential, ‚Äòwhat reality‚Äô type crisis people find many things fixed unchanging thought. unsettling realize things seemed solid gravity aren‚Äôt reliable instant. people going nuts seem wanting reality snap back understood real before. 

(I know ongoing dumpster fire Trump administration similar effect me. get away much made question essential nature US many ideals around meritocracy, good behavior rewarded, etc. Likewise resurgence public racism exposed many flaws understanding world actually works. thought world much nicer place is, even plenty examples contrary). quit job Publix. Everyone south goes it‚Äôs great job take great care employees. TRUE ALL! Besides getting hazard pay (just 50 dollar gift card maybe month), 0 enforcement masks. went managers concerns, brushed off. Really sad first real job didn‚Äôt think way company first. less regard employees despite reputation.

I'm working need to. I'll fucking done don't. OK?! I'm working want 

 looked fucking hero. I'm job... money. live much ask least considerate lives others? 

So much unpack here. first half saying virus harmless exaggerated, next saying humanity sickened doomed hubris deserves culling. close stock conservative dog whistles (""I'm gonna live fear"" ""society stupid hypocritical). inefficient way sanitize large scale like that. Holy shit. almost spread around entire world 3 months treat like robots? That's great not? That's stupid, everyone knows best way cure autism abortion. Cops wear seatbelts. joking, Google it. think restrictive reason many police die car accidents. beyond miserable restaurants too. Yeah made laugh headline. 13 years since worked supermarket treat human back either. Though I'll agree I'm sure covid made even worse, let's play like people treat poor minimum wage earners like garbage every day matter what. even whisper word ""union"" store we're fired. always treat everyone respect dignity. Every time checkout store, always wish cashier good day, safe. store door greeters, also say them. costs nothing kind. stupid pandemic going change inside. cases fly past 100 million mark, expect quarantining become stricter enforcement get harsher, mentioned.

It's never going end bud, come conclusion putting pieces together: look economy, look unemployment levels, look growing instability (civil unrest), struggling supply chains China refusing cooperate, tell us originated letting us investigate source ourselves.

Not problems, we're also held back incompetancy leaders like Bolsonaro, Russia, Trump CCP, got conspiracy theorists believe random shit virus fake, ignorance young YOLOing twats refuse cooperate instead continue party gather crowded places.

We're fucked mate. Anyone tells otherwise outright delusional believes we're movie like Contagion shit gets really dark, deus ex machine pulled someones arsehole. That's dangerous thing believe absolves responsibility. Absolutely people baddies care personal comfort cant bothered wear goddamn mask means slowing spread helping fellow weaker citizens. ""Every man "" ..the ruthless individualism capitalism world know Vietnam also learning hard way (having thoroughly defeated strain originally).

But actuality, good happening. Ventilated masks spread virus. Science proves it. Bar hopping pretty common many countries. chicken thing get. actually quite intelligent. spin circle day dizzy.

Multiple tests get lower positivity rate actual reality. Many experts actually suggesting multiple tests shouldn‚Äôt counted positivity rate reason specifically. ""The differential response virus suggests individual patient, unique characteristics, heavily influences Covid-19 disease severity,"" said ""We think lung immune system differs Covid-19 patients, understanding patients' lung immune systems helpful harmful, may able help physicians proactively manage risk-patients,"" noted.

 Well.. that's helpful. Nobody paid less $15/hour treated like human. Hey fuck face. Maybe people actually locked couple weeks wouldnt 5 months later. 


Fucking morons Lucky Wife Romanian citizen, thus EU citizen... exit easy. I'm sure matter you, NYT estimates we're already 200k deaths due COVID-19 looking excess deaths compared past years.

You troll, not, tell then, first link, cbsnews article about? running list types reports? 6 days huge rally now. probably already walking around signs developing cough mild shortness breath question comes mind. option would likely scam - vaccine supposedly Russia vaccine supposedly India ? probably managed ex-Nigerian princes original revenue stream dried up. are, course, *official*; Trust them. hard decide two options. tell one 100% another 100% ? silly dichotomy. sensible thing would lock down, hit hard, flatten curve, re-open gradually safe paying people stay home choose health losing homes. Canada's approach, economy picking jobs faster clip relative population guys. We're woods yet, I'm optimistic pull through. 


You can't functioning economy people getting COVID left, right centre scared go spend. Explain AOC 2018 rigged. Also New York progressive. 

If elections rigged try hard stifle mail voting. bartender/server...it's us. promise you. flu 0.1% Regarding surfaces. security guards Austalia caused outbreak shared lighter. heartbreaking. 
I wish people could treat nice respect, always. It‚Äôs north central Florida almost North Florida. know Florida shitsville, don‚Äôt lump Orlando central Florida garbage shenanigans Ocala Marion county  broken assault rifle IDK happen result like outcome dengue vaccine experiment?  dictionary representative society uses words. arbiter proper usage, per se. People broken definition literally. Best luck yall there! world definitely looking answers shit storm in, essentially stepping stone vaccine ever one! informing testing aggressivly week, since apparently visible enough. Made announcments tarmac busses etc. hard say expert field, effective anti body test point feel like bigger ask. said maybe UK Government talking tests given false hope Yes, Arizona Florida huge hospices I'm glad fat-shaming insulting, help people lose weight. might even make people reluctant seek help. 


I agree prevention key. Making healthy food sport accessible, educating people health: yes please. However also important remember people weight problems care eat healthy. take medication make gain weight, physical problems make really difficult exercise. even 'just' overeating, that's always conscious decision. Sometimes coping mechanism eating disorder.

I get point always easy taking care yourself.  dont eat meat??? Equivalent 911 every day. agree this. Got first job local grocery store I've shopping whole life right around Covid making way area. Ended worker's compensation ripping ligament left foot due manager telling go training. Ended suing grocery store give insurance company video proof injury happening. Came back work month later. updates training sanitize interact customers asking do. left go back before. lead multiple verbal warnings managers. Ended getting fired lunch need services anymore. bullshit, store staffed. month later made sign document saying cant work company ever. eat meat, got first place army lets them... Yep. suggestion work. NZ already G strain first wave. R0 NZ 5 second half March. NZ got hit much later countries G strain already dominant time. beat before, again. verge going Level 4. surprised that's PM's announcement tomorrow afternoon. it‚Äôll like even vaccine... would love state catch on. Instead we've dropped testing numbers. 

Well, testing means cases so... thoughts. virus spreads rapidly indoor areas poor ventilation hence NE fared better sun belt. We're almost completely indoors summer months. winter numbers drop lower it'll nice enough outside open windows. might easier Christmas. think NE Midwest fucked though beating. worked pandemic restaurant manager. got 0 extra pay benefits work week increased 45/50 hours week 60 more. Hailed ""heroes"" treated like shit. think come tax time, social security number doesnt register claiming unemployment money entitled larger refund check. Literally walked grocery job reason. Please tell troll? ""Muzzling people"" hell lol US government completely failed build sort national testing infrastructure need limit tests speed results. 

Shithole country. always get flu shot, I'm extremely high risk. work home week wife starts new job work home, hunkered quite well. may first year skip shot feel somehow certainly catch COVID going get one. I'm home flu season, could possibly catch that? still feels risky lesser two evils think. course action willingly sacrifices people‚Äôs lives

This right mindset problem with. believe anyone opposes belief ""willing sacrificing lives"". evidence lockdowns saved single life. fact virus seems followed similar paths populations regardless strict country's measures gone show opposite, anything.

Meanwhile people dying they're scared go hospital heart attacks strokes. They're dying they're missing cancer screens treatments. Personally believe people like ones sacrificing lives ignorance. There's evidence stupid virus worse moderate flu, nobody would consider demolishing economy futile attempt stop flu.

Right UK summer flu people even know exists killing 5x people Covid-19 killing, despite viruses transmitting exact way far anyone tell. whacked 12% death total. [The true death total never known, though almost certainly large portion lower currently lol know that. see people little troll bodies? can't shit lol. let them, must make sure 'rich' punished globalist agenda. think goes ways, city folks refusing hear local experts say systems region think know better.  absolutely agree think youtube/facebook algorithms frightening. quite easy fall echo chamber unless physically remove channels/videos suggestions. way, disinformation spread facilitated 'AI'. I‚Äôll happily self quarantine home, I‚Äôm going hospital. 

Granted I‚Äôm US I‚Äôd foot bill that. Fuck that. 

Anyone tries dragging out, I‚Äôll bring em cough directly face. comparison show 1% people usually perceive. See need take moment think. Lock effective way deal COVID. It‚Äôs proven every country back linking COVID cases percents us rest world. agree % chance higher, I‚Äôm totally sure it‚Äôs fair comparison. term contracting. go grocer get Covid someone, I‚Äôm certainly going get HIV way.

If totally paywalled, work. COVID Crabs strain, coming soon! Honest question. possible know wether produces contaminated origin somewhere else? International trade involves lot people way production site consumers Grow up. 90% people asking question certain category person care answer asking say ""OMG covid worst thing ever."" Maybe sub better happening there. 

And one left sub me. People maybe left people writing questions like ""I walked within half mile someone, need quarantine?""  Cleetus looking hairstyle ever seen life learning stigma getting sick pushing people allow effective contract tracing. People giving full information interacted with. see mean I'm advocating nothing, I'm realistic think NY model followed, control limited lock down, pushed masks distancing everywhere less 1% positive rate, exactly looking lockdown started. people essentially live new normal really working badly. point south catch fine wait vaccine without another lockdown. Edit:
I finally got answer phonecalls:

You need entry form accessible 48h befor flight www.gov.uk evedince non stay critical corona area (Bank account statement example). No, isn't. fear powerful force. fear ""being brought somewhere"" (and choice) quite likely instill irrational behaviour (such denying tested/hiding symptoms) many people. 

Mandatory quarantine might likely work combination mandatory (randomised) mass-testing similar measure. good second part equation (the treatment/quarantine) mandatory  enforced first (the identification) isn't. significant flaw humans hard wired react discrete events rather much larger slow moving long-term catastrophe

It's we're fucked long term Hey hey hey! fattttttt linebacker Well said ""Those churches going packed!"" Wtf? They're already paid low expect greet you. perform whole musical enter well? Tone entitlement like expendable workers. Thanks! Definitely, possible.

I don‚Äôt think CDC terrible.

Of course going get lot wrong virus we‚Äôre seeing literally first time human history. teach shouldn‚Äôt mean risking life disease don‚Äôt know anything terms long-term effects. experience, I‚Äôve known teachers teach order perpetuate ideological narratives. 
 
Ideally, sure. that's world live anymore. Hopefully that's great news, assuming there's least level immunity among them. six month outbreaks discovered frozen food, I'm guessing saying ""why warn us China!"" stupid autocorrect... ‚ÄúKaren‚Äù term since least Dane Cook standup 2006 Protesting masks seems like retarded selfish thing do. protesting idea protecting yourself, family everyone else. Suck people. Stop cry babies. Oh no, Karens organizing. Maybe ole plains Americans get bad since lot imported China /s needed Also meant say, argument ignorance. argument Nice job making kinda look tiny bit ignorant 

Will people finally acknowledge level herd immunity biggest driver numbers decreasing? months sub anyone suggested NY lower numbers reason ""they mask more, stricter lockdown take seriously"" downvoted hell. Russia:we promise polonium! I‚Äôm shocked Sweden. thought guys top education, wages, healthcare etc etc. Hey, CDC leadership perfectly capable bad time. New Zealand seems dictatorial lockdowns even China point... it‚Äôs kind scary. Germany's uses Russia's natural gas, they're going use vaccine? understand lot smart people working hard vaccine. also understand vaccines hard figure out, counting vaccine come soon foolish. Actually HIV quite treatable days headache keep thinking first part Stand book, regarding virus spreading, Government trying hide it. chapter, whcih spreads expontantly across country scary shit! China found positive test inside frozen salmon. think cold environment sustain virus.. outbreaks cold food processing plants several countries. Freedumb ain't free, costs childrens' lives Yer drunk, Mr. Hat! mistakes? Laconia week leading father's day? Unless there's different one. Correct. sirgucal mask worn directly one's face. apprently acceptable despite increasing evidence virus airborne /aerosolized. concerns bit recently great decrease tests active states (Texas, Florida, Arizona, etc), overall cases still holding steady 50k+ range. tested capacity recommended turn around time point, would look REALLY ugly.

For worth, greatly want much anyone. I'm wishing doom gloom pained see many family friends suffer last months wide spectrum reasons. Luckily, wife field pretty essential along stable income taken every possible precaution follow every possible health recommendation. see much hopeful coming months.

Wishes safety, security, health everyone there. even outside near someone. routinely curbside check dog grooming people think choose option, exempts wearing mask. lot times try come store without one tell wear one say ‚Äúwell I‚Äôll go outside curbside then‚Äù get pissed tell one too. Like, I‚Äôm going gave near take dog you, please mask on. Like cruise ship üò£ wife work (different) international companies english almost common German. Also many Germans dont issues talking english (if say 60?) since part school core curiculum.

Merriam Webster even made page people like maybe know people, including Charles Dickens... 1839. mass pig culling? Lol no. Finland, Norway, Denmark way better.

Many propaganda people cherry picking date make Sweden look good. find random numbers Sweden better numbers, go whoa Sweden better Spain won.

Oh god bots tilting. virus dangerous enough force quarantine people. fear dangerous virus itself. fitness industry hit back perception gyms COVID-19 hotspots, claiming transmission virus linked Fitness Australia chief executive Barrie Elvish said industry gathered data - random sample members‚Äô electronic access cards, across sample different gyms - proves facilities Since gyms reopened June 13, 6.26 million visits 423 NSW gyms, recorded community transmission, ‚ÄúThe cannot said restaurants bars NSW cluster cases started spread,‚Äù said statement ‚ÄúHowever, gyms still categorised entertainment venues cast negative light.‚Äù Yeah. another method used keep us pissed instead realizing really screwing us over.

Its insane violent people get told least protect others. seat belt laws cause happen too? Sure feels like it. Watching happen caused lot depression. What‚Äôre ‚Äòfacts‚Äô fatality rate? really dense reason they're dehumanized way system built around entire categories people expendable, government large companies caring die.  


This come surprise. 1980's, US little AIDS ravaging gay community Reagan administration care people died. recently, look callous indifference new Orleans Katrina, Puerto Rico Maria. difference category expendables grown much larger includes majority Americans certain net worth.  


I complain Canadian government, can't imagine horror realizing government sees majority population entirely expendable. Wrong. Vote. r/holyeyebleach fuckwit. likely developing herd immunity

You find epidemiologist virologist believes currently way true. mayor Washington NC? way mostly feel may encounter people outside put mask on.  Everyone needs accept masks going part day day lives next years least on.  pandemic going last coming.  people suck everyone selfish. ones selfish dying, dead stopped caring others. virus free going daily lives quite happily 100 days, considered reached objective.

Thank god Gov. Little reasonable pandemic. good, reasonable...which 1000 times better GOP Governors  13 news confirmed cases community transmission today, might already late contain unfortunately.  call shit front everyone line.....dont whine Aye, primary reason I'm still job health insurance. Honestly, hate job, health insurance *fantastic.* years ago, spent hours ER wound kidney stone. bills, plus handful follow-up visits doctors wound costing like $400 end all. Would thousands otherwise. everything that‚Äôs going country decades would still think legitimate elections that‚Äôs entire time? Like that‚Äôs one thing think wouldn‚Äôt corrupt? would feel best contact tracing. almost guaranteed come contact virus. agree, unfortunately people don‚Äôt want convinced. argue changing minds different matter. Even politicians can‚Äôt convince people. Right, internet forum many folks radical least fringe ideas health. Often times line political takes like Sweedes case. nice see reasonable discussion! Oof two edits, following reddit history? Desperate much? kids school August? dont know man. Im business owner employees around 10 people. received government help. Also cousins, friends know of, almost everybody know living minimum wages said got help. corrupt officials heard barangay captains even report directly. 2 reported investigated know of. sit, seems workers treated better customers appreciative... don‚Äôt oust see happening accurate. Maybe it‚Äôs regional? IDK.. thing older generations taught way live particularly compatible world live today.  Age absolutely part it. Chlorine dioxide - Clo2 ""bleach"", lots studies proves effective wide range pathogens, including SARS-cov2. 

It's perfectly safe ingest small diluted amounts. actually widely used water disinfectant / purifier many militaries municipal city water treatment plants, well millions hikers, backpackers campers every year.

I prefer surface sterilizer. That's labs hospitals use it. works. 

But use purify water tanks every years. much safer chlorine bromine, adverse health effects chlorine bromine thyroid.

There point trying argue facts, every one easily verifiable. 

With said, guys think cure-all take multiple times day causing harm good. Mild occasional use good, lot benefits. prolonged use powerful oxidant like Clo2 actually causing excess free radicals allowing electron exchange, essentially making existing conditions (especially arthritis) worse. 

It also kills beneficial flora gut. Gut microbiome paramount health. 

Grenon correct said Guardian ""paid liars"". media paid liars. it? Sports worst example choose. Athletes get replaced every day. Yes, SARS. Covid SARS-2 SARS acts nothing like Coronaviruses regarding immunity.

So use comparison blanket coronavirus absolutely nothing like Covid, compare Covid, SARS-2, SARS-1.

Truly fuck media trying run ignoring fact literally SARS-2 Oof sad. Two edits fact without even reply? ~~Spanish~~ Flu bro? clearly confusion this, guidelines read straight source

I'm aware document, pretty much quoted recorded medical certificate cause death decedents disease caused, assumed caused, contributed death.

I dont think car crashes coded Covid deaths. whole world ambiguous cases.

What interpretation part purpose mortality classification (coding) produce useful cause death statistics possible. Thus, whether sequence listed ‚Äòrejected‚Äô ‚Äòaccepted‚Äô *may reflect interests importance public health rather acceptable purely medical point view*. Therefore, always apply instructions, *whether considered medically correct not*. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs difference elective things central things society needs do,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúWe need get kids back school. need make sure get education. That‚Äôs first priority.‚Äù - Wolf

Also Tom Wolf Dem governor last term, cant reelected. cpworker wore one one day said never again. Moisture built clear part point longer clear, completely negating purpose wearing clear mask. think random Biden chose Kamala Harris, lawyer former DA

Its random guy wrote crime bill chose DA locked shitload innocent people. sign they're going crack progressives like Republicans are. He's telling middle ""I tolerate protests"" picking Law Order type. 

God fucking naive. little extra info use it: Vitamin hormone, vitamin. dig deeper synthetic vitamin ideal form. It‚Äôs best get sunshine obviously, krill oil supplements close second. need large sample size prove large results. sure someone get around it. I‚Äôll say back clearly didn‚Äôt hear me. Water fucking wet Tests nationwide increasing. Tests hardest hit states decreased dramatically. click bait/misleading headline actual content article valid.  We're even getting obvious ones. 

My County told mild cases get tested early Yeah, here. safety aspect wonderful, itch uncomfortable annoy nose. Still, maybe I'll wear supermarket afterwards, nit day long work. Covid downplayed, logic sound. need look per capita impact, total numbers. population US lot lower now. Covid deaths could reach 600k still par say. can't kill soul. 

Nice try though. can't inherit debt. home. ""evicted"", technically that's term renters. Sounds like living deceased mother's home years settle things. Interesting. Republican states reducing testing. sure looks. Yup. Retired 45 years nurse. I‚Äôm risking life care Covid patients inadequate PPE especially mask assholes. Vit deficient years. originally 300000 IU month (the dosage changed week, cutest pills - little green gel caps) I'm 100000 IU every week rechecks every 6 months. think reached 35 ng/dl years around 23 ng/dl. I'm still tired, paler pale burns quickly family history melanoma. Vitamin pills is! mask simultaneously lets every particle , doesnt let gigantic CO2 molecules out. it? week talking about? see 44,726 deaths couple years ago one week, nothing lower 45,868 deaths week year.

Week 28, ends July 12, 45.9k deaths. really near all-time low (though barely summer baseline level good). norovirus. Still way go then. Probably parents getting kids tested going back school *regime Criminals playing lives thousands people scientific experiment. pretty much walled Hubei intl flights. 

And every western country like muh human rights. studies. studies could link one. stated before, guidance based known previous viruses lieu limited information new disease. Hand washing good advice either way. Clearly don‚Äôt think ‚Äúpulled thin air,‚Äù you‚Äôre desperately building straw men arguments. zero evidence supporting fomite transmission SARS-COV2. 
 
You know, record: doctors used tell people limit much cholesterol eat seemed like good advice help lower people‚Äôs cholesterol. Dentists used tell people floss prevent gum disease. lot doctors dentists still give advice. There‚Äôs also zero scientific evidence supporting either claims. limited information, doctors try help. That‚Äôs suggest washing hands. It‚Äôs good advice. Like flossing limiting red meat consumption. couldn‚Äôt hurt. 
 
But literally zero evidence supporting it.  Antibodies take 8-10 days show covid-19 15 minute tests, would weeks? mean say would eat animal diseased spice it? laws... well going agree disagree. Enforcement certainly joke. want to.

Can confirm. Prostitution illegal Singapore still red light district. Probably obvious example. depends.

The reality TV star chief says yes. expert battled multiple pandemics helped contain (take pick, dozens point) says ""HOLYSHITNOWHATTHEFUCKAREYOUTHINKINGDON'TINJECTBLEACH!"" best way raise number redheads children other. Someone needs set dating site redheads.  thought Channel Tunnel horrifying! sad. really strange modern society teach kids better people overall mental health general. Even basics would immeasurable long term benefits society whole.

The prison system would also greatly benefit it. strange concerning affecting kids more. wonder what's causing stop it?

Oh well, suppose we'll never know. school, kids. Yeah, basically treat everything fridge freezer could contaminated. Even wipe groceries putting fridge freezer, could still miss spots virus survive. Rather add extra steps use caution kitchen. wash hands grabbing milk handled raw chicken. virus way less deadly ever imagined.

Unfortunately, jury still that.

I'm trying doom/gloom this...but pragmatic. global medical community still idea long-term-effects contracted novel coronavirus. Children represented *every* metric including hospitalizations death. 

You can't use excuse get tested enough plain that, obviously. 

Also immunity partial. might explain extremely high rate asymptomatic mild infections. Which, turn, contributes total effect virus extra deaths attributed effects virus. It‚Äôs cleaning wiping equipment. evidence virus spreads effectively aerosolization, increases exert yourself. Additionally, gyms cooled air conditioning fans helps move virus around gym. people spend hour inside gym, increases risk. Wearing mask provide protection they‚Äôre mostly effective preventing transmission. mask doesn‚Äôt fit well, gaps allow air escape, becomes damp/wet, effectiveness decreases.

So regardless, gyms high risk environment definitely part problem. open man! Academic Advisor disagree taking time off. Unfortunately public, state funded schools, may much choice. state keep cutting educational funding impacts state sponsored schools. lot people know money comes private donors (thus buildings auditoriums sports fields named ""random"" people businesses). But, donors making money, donating much. receive donations, relay head count classes bring tuition fees. turn skyrockets turion rates. vicious. I'm lucky work private online (and yes, profit) University quite secure. However, husband works state run University school seen many people cut due budget shortfalls. COVID helping.

Edited grammar Same, find heat bright light unbearable lot time. Also ginger, also deficiency. take supplement now, honest never noticed much change treatment. depends, many people short-term/long-term disability benefits (and should) use cannot work. opt it.

And employer cannot fire illness, would wrongful termination suit heartbeat.

The level ignorance side table, friend. One states governor that's trying minimize loss life? People r/coronavirus absolutely apparently. thread hilarious. relate. me, choice go even minor fillings year now, may need root canal. I'm skipping cleanings now, can't skip anything else. that's likely vitamin issue. People darker skin notoriously vitamin deficient. estimated 80% African Americans vitamin deficient. I'm Mediterranean descent I'm olive toned I'm unable keep vitamin levels normal unless take supplements living United States. I‚Äôm phase 3 part study, basically told keep normally do. Though makes sense since phase see efficacy vaccine side effects. show COVID symptoms use home test provided. Overall process simple, time consuming due paperwork. start finish office 6-7 hours. 

I received first dose Monday, second dose 3 weeks that. there‚Äôs checkups every 6 months 2 years. 

Side note, believe got vaccine placebo. injection site pain, muscle/joint pain, slight sleep disturbances, nausea, stomach/bowel issues. None bad, injection site still hurts. Definitely better catching disease. Thank you! coronavirus? wonder could fix trying harder. fix right up. grocery workers I'd say. work bank praised us number new accounts brought number deposits rise time covid cut hours making enough. like ??? really changed outlook bank real quick. 149/148 depending count non resident  Texan here.

Stop living hypothetical wannabes Increase salary! add that:


""herd immunity"" means complete failure mitigating controlling virus (and actually worse reinfection occur).

It means everyone catch catch it, everyone would potentially die die it. 

The Spanish Flu 1918 good example herd immunity work. think pretty much assume it‚Äôs everywhere behave accordingly. depends getting respective viruses. 
Sure, 30yr old poor sub-saharan african, much better catching Covid. 
If 60 yr old rich Westerner? well... gets interesting. 

HIV treatments advanced patients barely affected - catch early enough getting correct medication. think something Trump *actually* said, though post *is*.

I'm pretty sure Trump *actively* made outbreak worse. Like, virtue right thing contain it, things actually contributed spread directly. lot states actually seeing good numbers, PA 6.5% positive rats, 5% positive rate. 

But Tom Wolf, Dem governor PA, said school important thing, cant close schools.

""There‚Äôs difference elective things central things society needs do,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúWe need get kids back school. need make sure get education. That‚Äôs first priority.‚Äù Good points around. gets people belligerently non compliant, even without getting physically violent. still want treat people ""don't know it"" accost people ways would reasonably assumed spread did, people treated though intentionally spread it! really think so.

However people ""don't know it"" ""forgot bring mask"", sure let off, long otherwise amicable compliant (such request ""don't come store forgot mask""). fact even needed gives even evidence profits important than. Covid ain't brown man beard, important. Oregon county decided make people color exempt mandatory mask policy, citing potential racial profiling. decision comes multiple counties Oregon ramped face-covering requirements slow spread coronavirus. County's general directive requires everyone wear face-covering indoor public setting, outdoor setting six feet social distancing can't maintained. county wrote website ""People color heightened concerns racial profiling harassment due wearing face coverings public"" exempt rule. exemptions include children age 12 people particular medical conditions disabilities. 

I never said order. said racist exemption implemented, reversed. seems like trolling, either can't seem get past language barriers. Corona Air? Getting offended internet huh? I've giant pump like 2 years. Isn‚Äôt article fairly obvious lol? don‚Äôt get it. means Dow goes up, ABSOLUTELY live Maryland. We've got great numbers governor done exceptional job - happens republican. 

Most restaurants converted parking lots outside dining. I'll bet continues winter addition portable heaters. That‚Äôs call ‚Äúlying‚Äù.  think anyone denying occasional false positive happens - tests good, though I'd suspect would caught follow-up tests (my uncle tested positive COVID needed re-tested 5+ times).

But know almost certain aggregate, we're undercounting yeah, understand people get wrong impression based one two events fit confirmation bias, there's definitely nothing aggregated statistics show sort overcount - fact exact opposite. Oh god. That‚Äôs fucking horrible. I‚Äôm sorry. 

I‚Äôm glad got virtual. Sure, want keep risk close zero possible. Less likely sufficient me. want catch route. ""9000"" dead COVID-19

I think need re-examine mawmaw's pawpaw's COD Yeah (the U.S.) still #1! 5 million confirmed estimated affected 10x...50 million.
[CDC chief says coronavirus cases may 10 times higher million approx. 330 million ~15% U.S. population. news, water wet. edge case need take additional precautions, perhaps need additional circumstances.

But quit acting like rule exception. Yes, season heart problems. propaganda. downvoted. think saying excess deaths mean nothing bit strong. Sure get point there's factors influence statistic, mean get value estimating impact Corona. Unless understand important gym someone‚Äôs mental health don‚Äôt think form proper opinion. years it‚Äôs kept trouble, focused, kept depressed. It‚Äôs major outlet lot people. think it‚Äôs major reason successful now. don‚Äôt understand someone‚Äôs passion doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs there. It‚Äôs everyone.

I've read they've 1% test positive. successful?

2. heard sports radio allowed ""massage therapists""... appears mostly exotic dancers come go. Numbers steadily going down, good news.  ironic models Sweden 90k deaths hear that. difficult communicate people this. know short-term data even data showing signs full recovery majority people symptoms. medical reports saying people symptoms survived suffer 33% chance sepsis within next 2 years (John Campbell YouTube). remember got data still promising regards full healthy recovery. believe figure 70% symptoms still three symptoms since contracting virus currently testing negative disease (MedCram YouTube). small test group 300 something recovered patients may needed peer-reviewed. ignorant thinking workers protections. [This even easier read interesting. that‚Äôs true let tell must immune every fucking contagious virus went US school system 2001-2014, went Ohio state university 2014-2018 lol sure voted. isn‚Äôt contagious 1918 flu inability convey intended endorsement need education. Exactly man, exactly. 

Shit, mail normally sits least week arsed read even normally, lol.

That's loathe studies like this, gets people put energies wrong places risk assessments incorrectly. actively harms ability make good choices. Take-out life favorite places Ooh, where? like Ida-NO, amirite?  No, herd immunity. ok. many people took jordan dietician. else regarding academic work?

Outdoors safER safe. Maryland US, contact tracing shows top three sources virus transmission, order, family events, bars restaurants, outdoor events. sound like outdoors safe it? Especially since outdoor dining legal. Nothing could make go back still get people commenting back saying masks work crap.

No transmission option society. live lives Covid-19 going us 10+ years. Would exposed viral fragments trigger immune response? mean extent acting like vaccine anything, maybe help make eventual infection mild? don‚Äôt.

But Americans this, right? don‚Äôt masks social distancing pictures. There‚Äôs plenty more. America bad, Also adults make decisions. Plenty parents area saying ""Germs build immunity!"" There's episode [CBC's podcast discuses this:

South Carolina 15.7% today, actually much better. 8/11, 20%. Schools set open Aug 17th. kids meet next week school Leap day (some kind person event). Reduce overall incidence, reduce overall severity. important, neither guarantee get it, get sick. 

Think like flu vaccine, measles vaccine.

NY everything right illness already spread measures even taken. ""I believe {insert fact}""

Phenomenal use logic. inspiration irrational, feelings-based opinions Yeah, everything trade re: time resources (disinfectant wipes, case) spent, versus actual, probable, possible effectiveness.

Some things like masks extreme actual effectiveness, everybody absolutely them, morons.

Other things, like segregating mail 3 days, extremely unlikely matter, low effort essentially costs zero resources (using small cardboard Amazon boxes side table) figure not, even there's 1% (or less) chance matters. actually used segregate mail 5 days, decided excessive based reevaluation, changed 3 months ago. Maybe excessive... like said, takes basically zero effort resources. Damnit, nobody got saying. Must paid comedian.

A hoaxer thinks media hype. Given that, he'd say heck yeah huge spike!

The /s meant anyone reading know joke. Best estimates put fatality rate 0.5-1%. 

It's obviously crazy high number get dropped us blue, originally talking 3-5% fatality rate, I'm actually heartened gradual drop fatality rate. Lots things skewed data start well. instance, places testing already hospitalized people testing capacity shortage. Italy rocking like 12% fatality rate. done lots studies fat show affected normal obese diseases. ~~Spanish~~ Flu bro. I‚Äôm starting think maybe Bin Laden would better leader, least honest intent kill innocent Americans. /s  I‚Äôm back college super worried sent home. school tests everyone arrive, contact traces positive cases, isolating positive cases, enforcing strike mask wearing requirement.

Many people learning heart disease leading cause death change diets. hope one lucky ones. I'm sure moral argument logic food big part culture. Receive orphan support benefits federal government? Denmark, unscientific neighbor run populist politician 0 ICU (by Swedish standards counts people ventilators). despite new cases going quite now. 

What worries Swedish numbers testing, tracing isolating enough. test isolate people symptoms. It‚Äôs likely wouldn‚Äôt discover half cases neighbors finding. 

Denmark test 5 times per capita still find them. anymore wouldve march. boils simple fact Children then, even now, rarely getting tested millions missed cases children.

Edit: US line comparison. whole, looked like country steadily increasing testing, large decreases states likely driving US line go start Aug.

The Texas, Nevada &amp; S. Carolina ones looks concerning since ramped up, suddenly gave August despite still hot spot. Arizona &amp; Florida looked like gave testing week July.

Please go educate yourself. agree virus likely running hosts spreads. sound like me. Welcome club. Young people haven‚Äôt exclusively caught virus since people dying, generally means people late 70s-100s still catching it.

The next question level infection within society sufficient induce herd immunity given peoples‚Äô varying degree susceptibility virus.

I‚Äôm sos prey family bunch assholes We'll never contained America due identity politics. seeing well New Zealand gives hope rest world. Anyone work home really. I'm one lucky ones I'm extremely grateful it. isolate rest country forced get infected braindead response virus. come out, another lady lobby witnessed whole thing came said wanted thank thinking everyone else's safety building screening people even though got backlash it. touching said me, almost cried.

And lady's name? Albert Einstein. Wait, miracle cure bleach sold going get heaven? many people related anyone. mean child baby another child, kid grow zero brothers, sisters, cousins. kind feel like normal, reasonable voice saying okay US currently keeping children cages Southern border.

Which is, know, normal reasonable use excess punctuation caps, measures. importing information evidence. It‚Äôs possible child shouldn‚Äôt flying. It‚Äôs certainly plausible scenario parents forcing something can‚Äôt handle due sensory input. it‚Äôs something assume lol. Berkeley bowl? unlikely...there vaccines 3rd phase trials much higher manufacturing capacity russian vaccine. company making Russian vaccine said would able make 1.5 million doses year, hope expand it. Well that's different problem fixed appreciative someone providing service much better demeaning asshole. Plenty people dont wear masks curbside pickup orders either. Like dude, dont roll window dont mask, I'll leave stuff outside car. unionized job government Canada love job. union super strong take lots money every month.

I see unions due low pay upfront cost unionizing. semi blind, bit short sighted, totally overpowered capitalism So... countries? Stop making voluntary.

Show courage. problem US locked many places didnt need locked yet. - seen covid 'likes' meat plants places cold temperature many areas Northern hemisphere winters cold often dry
- blood pressure increases winter, immune system gets weaker
- lack sunshine affects mood significantly decreases vit. production
- people spend time indoors
- flu (and respiratory diseases) season normally fall winter winter. though social distancing common face masking may big issue

... belive even reasons thinking winter going challenging exact amount time benefit last debated, primarily uncertainty around money diverted allotment. said, highest estimate I've seen still ~6 weeks.  vacation Duluth northeastern Minnesota. Would never know Covid thing. Hotels packed, restaurants busy, etc. 

At least there‚Äôs mask mandate it‚Äôs vigorously enforced everywhere indoors.

Great town lots outdoor stuff, socially distant people. essential workers

We gotta find new word ""essential workers"". least new way define essential. 

For example- local DMV offices, doctors (yes, actual private practices sspecialists- eyes, ears, etc.) things state closed. ""essential"". 

then, local starbucks, tiny trinket shops, bars stayed open, cause ""essential."" everyone area calling heroes open... 

Like fuck that. Nothing heroic early 20s kids working part time insurance job starbucks help pay college could getting literally *triple* amount filed unemployment. 

Instead, happened government offices near closed, employees furloughed (already making good money btw), eligible unemployment top making work. Meanwhile Young Mikey starbucks 20 years old scared go work, quits due covid fear *not* eligible unemployment. 

It backasswards system. Grocery store workers willingly working probably one important places country right easily high risk area, yet get nothing. 

God bless essential workers, wish way repay putting ""heroes work here"" sign something. fucking crazy times live in. curious this. examples? Life, liberty, pursuit happiness. Declaration Independence quaint something? God sub sucks sometimes lmfao  ordering curbside pickup better workers? already (high-risk group), feel guilty I'm endangering others get food. (Of course always tip, tips permitted, leave hand sanitizer.) Nah, intellectual curiosity sexy! üòá I'm Miami, public transit running fares suspended notice pretty much since started. dont ride public transit kinda sucks well, car definite necessity here, job requires visit metrorail bus depots running whole time. worth nothing. Thanks come close paying mortgage. extraordinary leader currently jail false charges. woman named Carole Baskin. Okay Gloomer Barack Obama get elected twice? Serious question. Illegitimate, legitimate, back illegitimate again? make sense. go work restaurant. career changed this. Unfortunately don‚Äôt know yet. 3 pretty damn close age allow without mask anyway... seems like poor uncommon sense. Boo fucking hoo. you‚Äôre doctor complain internet someone made day difficult you‚Äôre shit doctor lmao. mUh FrEeDuM pRoFiT tHuH bAcKs uV mAh WuRkErS!!11!1! event? mine- wear mask, face shield, glasses social distance way farther 6 feet worker grocery store vouch this! HEPA filter we'll hear fatalities 28 Days Later? anti mask folks work with, masks matter following employers policy. 

It‚Äôs loophole. They‚Äôre wearing them... around necks. Technically compliant. Opening school global pandemic really quite smart. Bloomfield raised possibility Wednesday virus arrived New Zealand via freight, given one infected family members works cool store takes imported frozen goods overseas.

This scary shit it‚Äôs true. No, bending rule **one** passenger sets dangerous precedent. big arms. Isn‚Äôt charge? Yeah truth Interesting. Although, imagine government collapsed military leaders would fill void. permanently, least become stable. government without military helpless. military without government anything but. I'm saying good (or bad) thing. wondering would backstop breakdown government. would stuck ground pandemic happened last fall instead. Also hat facemask got P100 respirator goggles apparently banned airlines. like girl back picture isn‚Äôt even covering nose (Reply person critiquing Biden/Harris ticket deleted comments:)

You‚Äôre right, you‚Äôre probably getting downvoted people mentally spiritually exhausted already dealing disastrous barbaric US handling pandemic‚Äîmost simply aren‚Äôt prepared grapple reality Biden/Harris administration governed entirely donors, reps fossil fuel industry prime seat table. 8 years turn ship around, capital wouldn‚Äôt allow it.

Presumably, reason still deny masks effective fact claim may dangerous false sense security (debunked) causing people touch faces (debunked) anything else may sound good proof.

Just recently much news e-mails multiple senior NHA officials obtained FOIA requests. paint picture small group arrogant incompetent men secure belief alone right permitting one nothing question penetrate belief. men top hierarchy decided strategy, decided stick it.

Oh, multiple e-mails discussing things they're wrong (like masks) foreign experts redacted. Wtf? problem/fault? serve. expected protect. enforcing mask mandates cops even fucking bother with. public attacks us. Serve protect? clear? Please fucking help us!!!! right survival takes priority right freedom can't both. Hopefully temporary separation. true. meantime need careful, worth it. Really scraping bottom barrel excuses days. Like least y'all creative conspiracies phoning in.

Bring demon semen lady back, fun. Russia be, developing countries. retail too. treat us even worse before. Like safety matter long profits up. Canada guilty too. supposed nice ones.

Try again? Good eye! Wow! idiot look even dumber now. isn‚Äôt even pride. worst willful stupidity insanity, vanity. isn‚Äôt political issue. 

This isn‚Äôt partisan issue. issue empathetic intelligent sociopathic ignorant. already got covid thinks immune, people get multiple times. listening scientists elitist, call limo get caviar.

These assholes use technology came science, lives enhanced experts crafting policy public good. Cell phones, air bags, sewage, electricity, antibiotics, refrigeration, TVs, list goes on. COVID politicized, well fuck it, needs science!

(Note blind worshipper scientists policy experts, knowing well humans flawed, they're generally better morons know jack shit). Actually, jury still question. immediate impact GDP much heavier countries longer/more restrictive lockdowns, still huge hit lesser lockdowns. countries manage keep virus bay, larger immediate GDP drop could balanced larger relative come backs (we *possibly* seeing now, US economy starts stall again, furloughs becoming permanent). Countries ongoing virus problems, like US, could trouble unemployment substantially higher comparable western economies. means even though GDP seen immediate recovery, see big wave bankruptcies Fed money dries up, businesses default loans. magnified decreased consumption caused unemployment figures. still know original 4 came from, means virus still circulating fast food. Us workers seen punching bag company watches every move. there's silver lining Covid might prod people affecting change

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* American, agree  actually 50-100 deaths though, point. Actual deaths per day hovering 20s weeks, numbers consistently inflated backlogged cases weeks months review, decided deaths actually caused COVID, clearly PHE's method counting results 100% fatality rate COVID time (because everybody ever gets put COVID death die), resulting 5,000 death reduction.

So, first said still dozens deaths per day people died months recovering still counted covid deaths... changed version decided backlogged cases.

It would also nice see based decided 5,000 people die covid, caused deaths nearly 25,000 people form gap number excess deaths new official count, far wider gap seen European People take 28 days die still counted COVID death certificate..

But official government figure based death certificates. ONS is, indeed recorded 56,770 covid deaths 31 July. now, die 28 days, die covid. sure you‚Äôre downvoted.

We're focusing lot Black Lives Right now, deservedly so. there's also class warfare going want talk acknowledge. whatever reason, there's large population white voters would prefer fight progressive policies would help - policies would also help people color. heaven forbid get grouped People claim membership Club Trump, even though they'd never allowed set Mar-a-Lago. public since [this posted  restaurant mix people. like tipping well take rarely happened before. think every nice, polite customer tables type laugh masks, feel entitled served, get annoyed we‚Äôre serving food disposable containers ‚Äúthe virus isn‚Äôt real anyway‚Äù. lot good, understanding people staying home ordering takeout, there‚Äôs assholes don‚Äôt care virus anyone they‚Äôre eating. inevitable... minimum $7.25/hr good treating like humans either. starters whole family get it. Customer service jobs soul-crushing work do. We've giving convalescent plasma patients months hospital SoCal. problem taking longer get plasma administer patients cause high demand, lack donors.

It used take anywhere 1 3 days us get unit convalescent plasma blood bank. wait gone 7 days due shortage.

If Covid, recovered, well enough donate please donate. infectious disease doctors normally order 5 day course Remdesevir, 1 unit convalescent plasma, Dexamethasone 4 mg IV PO, Vit C + Zinc + Pepcid. y‚Äôall think drug manufacturer first gets FDA approved vaccination COVID-19, shared manufacturers help production? ""Unattended children shall given espresso free kitten."" Love sign. Well, no, quote question regards using UV light disinfect. Imagine government took virus even half serious NBA. might lead people hide cases. know going imprisoned things love going avoid tested lie school 3 weeks plan. teachers 5 days week, select reduced number students go 2 days week, learn online prefer. classes day, outdoors, students stay one classroom day teachers rotate one per course. Also masks required (so say). plan sound? I‚Äôm honestly entirely sure. Meanwhile, ""special"" places usa ask leave come mask on. defended war Iraq ‚Äúprotecting freedoms‚Äù first started.

But also 10 11 years old time. Ah, see, got ""lucky."" stone actually passed hours got ER. shower, actually. sat pain hit full 10/10. three hours later, woke said shower basically pain. called doc said likely passed it, go ahead stay home work another days recover get sleep. entire week still going work, probably getting maaaybe two hours sleep night, roughly 20 minute bites kept waking up.

I still can't believe managed work kitchen week going pain every 45 minutes. Ugh. Funnily enough, doctors told work probably helped move along quickly did. Still, think could pay again. I'm quarantining sick, cant quarantine homes? seems step far. would ideal. Also keep mind education levels rise, fertility levels fall. Before, referring fertility trends also seen countries. Women education tend fewer children. I‚Äôm going tangent agree need focus addressing broken systems. case, protection covid vaccine likewise fade quickly requiring person receive multiple vaccines regularly pandemic ends? because, vitamin D, sleeping well, staying fit, eating well good things, prevent virus spreading..... Hey!... resemble remark... Accommodations put others risk reasonable. Reported nonsense. ELI5. 

If hospitals aren‚Äôt getting overwhelmed, what‚Äôs problem? Florida Georgia‚Äôs economies booming people working. Illinois shut completely and, yes deaths down. cost? economy shambles crime skyrocketing due closures. People die eventually. Covid, cancer. 

Millions unemployed Illinois hundreds getting shot streets due governor closing everything. I‚Äôd rather take chance Covid Florida job take smaller chance working get mugged thug looter.  Smoking give lung cancer -- John ""I smoked 200 cigarettes day"" Wayne  I'm surprised. 9 turned 35 day two, entire school risk. I'm afraid late school take action, though see saying ""partial closure."" 

Now watch run course, hopefully kill anybody. thing everyone attitude think bad nobody would sick. one rare nash equilibriums global optimal actually aligns personal optimal. anti-maskers exist forced protect others care us. Every food retail place needs security guards end pandemic. Contagion predicted government would scrambling everything could save people. show President golfing telling people inject disinfectant. Someone hit peak career article title. No, pandemic that's killed 160,000 Americans 6 months. back late 90s one first Ozzfests one side stages. Limp Bizkit comes out, still unknown time, Fred Durst starts set. jumps hat comes someone crowd grabs edge stage. stops song dead yelling security catch guy. Security get goes rant like ten minutes whole crowd booing him, walks stage band standing like idiots.

And fair, Nickelback suck, astute observation. Didn‚Äôt someone reveal EO, would need paid back come tax time? mean least two supporters died drinking fish tank cleaner bc thought kind HCQ kept spouting about, even COVID. Right Wing/AntiVaxxers read this: ""See even Fauci saying vaccines unsafe work!!!!"" I‚Äôve cops come house router name before. first stated, ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt ask Change it...‚Äù

It‚Äôs totally first amendment protected. move 6th? month this, people need able leave homes then. Expecting people sit home 6 months unreasonable, lead cabin fever. fact, since major symptoms cabin fever irrationality paranoia, Id' say clear huge swath American public already experiencing it.

The ironic part together *actually* locked far less that, 3 months max, set testing tracing statement need made. 

There's plenty data though shows indoor transmission far common outdoor, need speculate that. Agree though, fine people cook meals time especially proper enforcement distancing outdoor dining dangerous. That's rub though, lot establishments and/or localities enforcing guidelines. I'm positive that..  Nebraska. first week K-12. already 3 positive tests. 1 first day (non-student). 2 others 2nd grade different school different district. Sigh.

Edited spelling Deadliest day summer *so far* Bummer similar story heard far restaurant transmission came hotel UK, staff wore masks get sick, staff wore face shield mask *did* get sick.

Right. manual labor section workforce ""a bit lighter feet""?  
I'm sure bosses sympathetic understanding replace someone passing every half-hour.  
The level combined ignorance complete lack empathy regarding long-term impact even moderate-to-severe case COVID-19 pretty staggering attitude. Heres list thing Gov needs receive money.

1. Quit Trumps ball licker (Pence jealous).
2. Listen mayors mandate masks.
3. sacrifice children sending unsafe schools.
4. Stop douchebag listen experts.
5. man take responsibility.

I would settle 1 these. bar low, 1 fucking thing people happy.

Or whatever fuck want, kill voters, let lil Johnny infect Grandma, lick balls till silky smooth. wonder went wrong beg money. Fuck off. Yeah can't really go anywhere, countries letting Americans in. I've heard even Canadians vandalizing cars American states plate them.

When got wonderful Canadians something like that, pretty much lost game. [Here‚Äôs link bad, linked wrong article. Here's update yesterday.

"" ""We're moving wrong direction hospital admissions continues we'll see else could including sounding alarm residents moving alert system red,""¬†Hidalgo's spokesman, Rafael Lemaitre, said [an email ""

 

 

If want look reliable projections saying I'd encourage check article actual valid source looks projections MIT, John Hopkins University, Northeastern, Unviversity Texas, University Mass, etc. show cases mouth along music I'm always fighting urge dance perform. look like less nerd mask on. Plus kinda want masks fashion thing open back up. town ideal horror movie. Getting almost Twin Peaks kinda vibe too. Since pass along feel sick that‚Äôs kind pointless. might well talking different countries discussing United States response Corona. 

My comment arguing obviously wrong reason stated.

Maybe got wooshed. sure became HCQ nothing else... many studies flawed numerous aspects; study published Lancet retracted. HCQ doesn‚Äôt cause increased mortality unless given unsafe dosages. 

As side ‚Äúmore data,‚Äù I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre referring to... side silences physicians ignores half globe‚Äôs countries?

This last question false dichotomy. don‚Äôt choose one other. namely, shouldn‚Äôt prohibiting FDA approved drugs don‚Äôt serious side effects, thats common sense One end hooked Franklin's kite. making great argument government step ensure people sheltered fed time. Something similar Canada done. numbers seem line up, looks like 10% listed cases died COVID UK, mortality rate supposed around 1%. cases understated 90% seems right. issue trace isolate model entire lines transmission people totally asymptomatic finding cases 4-5 people line.

The fact Covid spreads even asymptomatic presymptomatic whole reason fucking pandemic still burning. we'd killed stupid thing alread Time play good news bad news:

The bad news is, ozone layer even thinner people begun injecting straight butts cure COVID-19.

The good news *jack shit* COVID-19, fart jokes associated *hilarious*. laughter really best medicine... American healthcare system send bill mail shortly. bizarre response comment. mention ATMS? No, mentioned disinfecting frozen cold food New Zealand case also seems little like trying hide something 

Baseless conjecture part. New Zealand seems like would one trustworthy countries considering theyve handled virus. sucks. love going movies, movie etiquette gone shit like every kind etiquette. 

Over half movies I've gone last years least one rude asshole. Methodology undercounting undercount:

They comparing ""all death causes"", accidents due less vehicle traffic, perhaps less work hours (for work-related deaths). Homicides/suicides separated. Perhaps down, perhaps relationship general mood/pandemic response, ""health condition""

Basically, deaths ""health condition"" classifications compared potentially covid-impact. There's literature strokes frequent covid patients. Whether stroke heart attack death directly caused covid not, increase amount shows effect. Exactly Gerogia hired 1,225 contact tracers July 1. average 3,491 new confirmed cases per day based past 7 days. Fair say capacity contract trace completely overrun georgia population 10 million. NY state pop 20 million 9,600 contact tracers, NYC pop 8.4 million hired additional 3,000 tracers. Cuomo said past ~600 new cases per day need least 3,000 tracers handle caseload within 48hrs. number implies Georgia ability contact trace ~250 new cases per day, 7% cases they're getting (and even assumes they're getting test results back timely manner, unlikely given Lol wish dollar everyone said Reagan, Bush, Trump. None left. bit I've heard politicians wanting control population, somehow using masks, depsite multitude laws already things like wearing seatbelt gets enforced far mask mandates causing far risk self others vs COVID. people hate regulation passion surprising. There's large political base really hates told all. completely agree, healthcare replaced. people fail understand importance prayer first place. trust God faith goes long long way. Praying help defines someone's faith displays one's trust God. funny thing God always answers say bullshit never ever agree I've seen prayers answered countless times I've seen prayers family answered countless times community. need, God always even I'm need, continue pray trust formed displayed. I'd say time prayer answered purposely done God. means ""trial"" faith occuring. test faith. quite simple think really.

Anyways went tangent haha, yes value healthcare never understated. idiot would test God completely ignoring healthcare ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø Ha think good education accessible Americans. Good one. American exceptionalism work. America exceptional ways. Stop comparing cream crop only. isn‚Äôt that. large country can‚Äôt compared small outliers countries size one American state. Three times week, day Sunday, horrific. going end every person US personally affected least one death it, yet politicians pretend nothing wrong want increase spread vectors schools number residential evictions expect quarter (but bet rich buddies waiting buy distressed properties cheap).

Corrupted every single sense. Perverted top bottom. like exactly would expect see slowdown /shutdown. fact see opposite excess deaths even less commuting, means excess deaths actually higher think. would rather get HIV coronavirus? true test would look memory T-cells seem last much longer. However, understanding much difficult costly run.

This understanding well. Looking T-cells cost prohibitive.

I'm little concerned idea ""immunity passports"" based easier test antibody level fact T-cells could much accurate measure. fact, could nearly zero antibody response strong T-cell response optimal would result nearly sterilizing immunity.  case, antibody test could falsely label immune people immune. Curious, nurse US, re-use PPE? change PPE patients? And, health quality life better position. Treatment improved sense screen blood clots &amp; cardiovascular issues now, focusing cytokine storm lot things countering that:

Couple things-

1. PPE running nationally again. Still alternatives N95, gowns, etc.

2. Healthcare workers already dying working overtime time. get worn down, mistakes made, due experienced providers dying first younger providers training radiology (or something similar) starting take ICU. start dropping, irreversible crisis clinical healthcare tree yields fruits every 10 years...

3. Best practices medications running out. countries competent national government hoarding/purchasing bulk causing run supplies. Hospitals trying ramp purchasing rough compete. hospitals move second best third best medications... PCR positivity 6% overall positivity 13.8%, antibody positivity must roof right? easy way tell something true gets downvoted Reddit, there's that. 

Many restrictions place get people vote left, mail voting obvious example. election less need tinpot governors unnecessarily choke economies. easy call people heroes. ask funding actually help them? Yeah, big FU people. again, foreigners killing native Americans people still blaming China world's poor response? You‚Äôre generalizing hundreds doctors based one says. That‚Äôs shittiest argument I‚Äôve ever seen. none politicians, physicians, tech overlords agree don‚Äôt religious/spiritual convictions. 

Try again. explanation people susceptible first place.

Overshoot result people whose bodies stop virus replicating detectable/ contagious level suddenly getting virus. nonsense.

It achieves extreme rates prison, meat plants, nightclubs etc. people susceptible. confirmed deaths divided around 1% (IFR). account excess deaths IFR usually higher apart lucky places. would certainly put health safety beard laziness, damn sure. It‚Äôs late SARS dismal handling, would censored. completely understand. Like really worth spending 60 dollars something cook home less?

Redditor one weird trick end restaurant industry good! take spread accelerated quickly March thought herd immunity inevitable. communication FHM confusing beginning even doctors charge infectious diseases protection (smittskyddsl√§kare) started thinking plan. said publicly. Talk mixed messages. California state system made online decision back May. Rutgers July  least someone saying besides rest us. It‚Äôs reassuring know thinks too. single senator able leave home without everyone questioning every step take. dont get personal lives resign. risks. course might work, long term risks taking test vaccine? majority COVID case spike area federal prison outbreak spread local population. fretting reopening schools local officials nothing praise prison officials allowed outbreak get bad doubled total number cases county. way interact strangers capitalism buying goods services

What boring, dystopian revelation. never really thought before. Gotta take get. Changing perspective apparently bad thing people. co workers could practicing precautions you? would make sense, next weaker immune system ask ask them: sources show work? also cultural genetic, don‚Äôt assume they‚Äôd rates.   matter it, result always same.

It spreads disease. So, plan. prior administrations somehow fail communicate plan current administration? need roughly 15 mins exposure enough virtal load. restuarants bars bad, people sit breathe in. Mask still eat drink, outside fine everyone properly spaced enclosed outsidd space. Stores also fine(assuming wearing masks) useally dont get enough exposure. Thats basics anyway, ofcourse compromised immune systems susceptible.  Could clue what's going like lot moron americans government party runs government bad policy? Slow testing Active daily ""the sky falling"" coronavirus subreddit? Obvious check. 

Its ok buddy. come bed now. Youre gonna Ok. I'm denier dangers Covid, think taking experimental Russian vaccine dangerous virus. went burrito place bathroom (at least officially) closed, dining area open half capacity, hand sanitizer provided. even way wash hands eating restaurant. Slight correction: anti-mask geniuses actually concerned people inhaling carbon MONOXIDE, CO2. important distinction carbon monoxide actually deadly. Also important distinction byproduct cellular respiration. Yes. certainly does. At-will/Right-to-work employment exemptions must first declared protected mechanisms. process usually engages fact. mandatory federal requirement companies honor exemptions. Figuring qualify, qualify fucking horrorshow bureaucratic red tape country, designed specifically benefit businesses reduce payouts employees. 

If believe anything else, keep pouring koolaid throat. üôÑ?? appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Unless aerosolizing thawing process problem. Like travel around college football games tailgate? I'd rather change perspective tbh so, asymptomatic rate must huge amount higher, given reported number cases. every one case 10 50 asymptomatic carriers. NZ actually telling people DON‚ÄôT need wear masks. Learn countries already second waves it‚Äôs late, NZ. Mask up. Thanks. Aw got removed. think funny. :( Farm land? cousins caught early southern Nebraska. First family heard time came fine. young.  traced protests like Conservatives tried say?

Currently working school Wisconsin. They(school administration) pushing job done time get final cleaning prep done. I'm watching localities quarantining kids/staff opening head I'm like ""are kidding me, still going open?""

Meanwhile states number keep going country highest one day death toll two months.....

Why would parents put kids back school endangering kids themselves. cant figure teachers would even come knowing risks. Teachers Unions need strike/walk actual solid dependable procedures place somewhat protect staff kids. Mask mandates would good start... Fish freezes quite well. know, work restaurant see travelers country ffs. I‚Äôve always wondered, proven causation correlation? think overestimate power impoverished teenagers seeking legitimate justice labor violations employers. Yeah mine little charcoal filters too. feature almost seemed like gimmick sure mask even functional seemed keep air could smell breath outside smells. Idk We're cousins original redhead immunity therefore immune. people would literally prefer risk death modify lifestyles fairly modest ways. Yeah I‚Äôve feeling sorry America past months... hope yous end alright end this... hopefully Kim jun trump whatever name doesn‚Äôt ruin bad.. What‚Äôs coolest, innovative thing you‚Äôve seen local city county government response pandemic? lost 3 cousins COVID. evidence COVID vulnerability familial? i.e. family member dies COVID, you‚Äôre chances dying greater? Philippians 2:4. Let look interests, also interests others. Already shortage heaters... mean flu ended WWII? Morons like believe trump's daily bragging even we're lowest. Hopeless country. Moron-infested shit-hole Vitamin deficient. doc said many Black people are. correlation susceptibility COVID-19? Uhhh no. Colleges open September 1st. vast majority opening next week. Therefore 2-3 weeks we‚Äôll see small outbreaks/students quarantining. impacts I‚Äôm talking about, deaths hospitalizations.  think so. know early one person snuck accept delivery food, got re-quarantined that. It'll worst tomorrow Damn, son! murdered him! Good point. Got sources that? missed that. said comes touching things? initially said spring, everything I‚Äôve seen awhile said infections come droplets. We‚Äôve also told repeatedly experts masks social distancing along hand washing best way control this. cite source? people taking food home.  look replies? linked peer reviewed paper proving multiple strains well map showing variations strains across world, 4 papers (1 peer reviewed) strain differing effects Yeah thinking that's bought I'm pretty much always isolated careful figured risk spreading negligible protected getting grocery store. really know trust description packaging though. know says n95 I'm sure I'd bet life it. lol they‚Äôre not. I‚Äôm doctor prophylaxis available ourselves. It‚Äôs really expensive it‚Äôs given hospital staff take ad absurdum, definitely attack seasonal flu kind contagious pneumonia causes manner.

Where would end?

If depriving single person 12 hours liberty saves one life, worth it? opportunity keeps coming much people spending 10% time isolated, hypothetically? 

What's acceptable amount imposition one person's life save one other?  I'd LOVE wearing masks became permanent thing flu season. People nasty. Eating unhealthy foods exercising major cause cardiac disease. Cardiac disease remains number 1 killer Americans. make run every day disallow eating unhealthy foods serve purpose? want people die mandating this? practically useless considering often lose antibody levels time. saying lose immunity (we still cellular immunity obviously) antibody tests done pandemic lasted 6 months gonna valuable. act like anything anyways. /s  book Depends anonymous federal police still showing shoving unmarked vehicles. Reminds scene: breaks heart. God help all, government isn‚Äôt. divine power kings it‚Äôs k. Plus Canada it‚Äôs really cess pool :P. I‚Äôm anti vac I‚Äôm gonna lab rat one haha Thanks, best luck pregnancy. Ah. Mine asked email. made one up. let through.


Edit: use one made like ‚ÄúTim@gmail.com‚Äù something similar let go rest article Please no. There's adults left administration. Even can't much they'd like, want keep good ones left. Assaulting service workers hate crime. That's Impossible. Yeah, shit. can't tell us new daily cases dropping essentially everything faciliate virus' spread. Hospitalizations going either, incredibly telling.  NBA players aren‚Äôt allowed bring family members friends, allowed massage therapist trainer visit NBA Campus. makes NBA players hot women Orlando Bubble disguised massage therapists even believable. Also, don‚Äôt forget IG Model claimed NBA player tried sneak People might understand different things word ""fleece"". think polar fleece, ie winter fabric; think one neck gaitor tested study also ""fleece"" likely different fabric altogether.

Polar fleece supposed pretty good moisture barrier (according tests done IRSST n Quebec) I've making masks fleece layer two cotton layers. Correct. downvotes lol long 65, morbidly obese diabetic, nothing worry about. Totally agree insufficiently treated, SARS-CoV-2 infection may comparable greater mortality 1918 H1N1 influenza virus infection,‚Äù Faust wrote paper.

This bad news developing countries wonder switching Impossible Burger would solve problem. Quantitative details. Consider qualitative details. Efficacy often means 'fewer yet better'. i‚Äôm sure planets without lead easier Source? sister 40 years old 22 weeks pregnant, brother-in-law invited in-person fantasy football draft house least 10 people plus significant others maybe kids... confused said attending live year. whole situation seems eerily similar Chernobyl, horrific, compounded problems America has, definitely marks downfall last true superpower.

It'll interesting see happens person know tested, three weeks ago, waited 12 days results. Major NC city. work outdoors building shit husbands usually work day. shit hear wives hilarious also make never want get married. people really get weird positions money sure happiness people's lives.  think intended uncomfortable amount money incentivize people work. pay people currently make makes sense nothing.

Now go back lockdown, would make sense increase unemployment normal wages keep people wanting go back work. 

I agree want people stay home, pay people money still going spending lot cases, quarantining home heard Canada US's Canada. I'll see out. Probably cause live state's kinda decided worth risk get dental check up. still feel danger go work tbh. mean Harbin? that's one get fired trying hide anything, rather bad job managing hospitals testing people coming hospital paying enough attention reduce risk spread someone slip through.

IIRC old man infected stroke, hospitalised stroke realise also infected COVID-19. everyone super, one Eugenics huh?

Yeah. Wow. mean least you‚Äôre honest saying old people don‚Äôt matter. Lives important economy. Ancient Greek's society fell plague. Realizing ideology enough stop plague killing 25% Athens population. Much worse happen plague stopped, economy fucking matter family lying 12ft underground got millions civillians protesting change president allowed shit happen. unfounded. know interpret information article.

It's stating biological origin disease came bat source. talk disease spread... mainly propogated, again, wetmarkets. look 'origin AIDs virus' find information talking originated simians like chimpanzee's primates. AIDs spread, however, consuming infected chimpanzees talking virus spread hotspots like discussing connection animal consumption zoonotic viruses. quote; 

*""Many viruses, bacteria parasites caused major diseases past zoonotic, meaning origin animals. graphic Winters' Instagram post, reposted @Cowspiracy, cites viruses diseases avian flu, Ebola, HIV, swine flu, SARS vCJD, arose humans infections species.""*

*""Zoonotic diseases happen humans animals near other. Common activities cause human-animal interaction include farming, hunting, ranching keeping animals pets. Human-animal contact also heightened humans encroach wild lands.""*

*""Most diseases cited graphic arose conditions animals hunted raised human consumption. documented epidemics caused strains avian swine flus past century.""*

*""The 1918 flu, infected quarter world‚Äôs population killed 50 million people, caused H1N1 virus historians say likely originated Kansas chicken farm. H1N1 strain reached pandemic levels United States Mexico 2009 likely origins pig populations countries.""*

End quotes.

Do zoonotic diseases general arise consuming animals? No. ones caused massive amounts avoidable damage death caused eating animals? Yes. AIDs would probably avoided level one hunted ate chimpanzees unnecessarily. Covid-19 never would propogated easily wetmarkets meatmarkets transmit through.  Thanks explaining. posting bother spell name consistently, trust it. true. laws passed never intended protection regular citizens. tiny mobile thumbnail thought said ""Nasty"" treated us like humans? say get ""I thought that's Trump told us"" Use common sense ffs. Welcome new normal: we‚Äôre concerned screaming stops. information number outbreaks linked grocery stores?  \2003. Congressman Bob Ney (R-OH) ordered cafeterias capitol change menu. committed perjury behalf Jack ""Abram"" Off, ended pleading guilty that, end political career. think 9/11 kind turning point America superpower. event invested much money wrong things, started closing economy, took eyes ball. also china seized oppurtunity grow. Cashiers weren't, people stocked bothered much. people come ready take anger someone. Health experts scientist pushing stuff forever, yet heart disease still kills around 600k year US alone. People simply care isnt immediate issue. focused masks distancing, would detract seriousness urgency aspects require little effort. Question sports. NBA little ""Bubble,"" Orlando playoffs. entirely possible major sports bubbles? Also Suns going bubble love work COVID. They're designed filter air coming in, going (painters care blowing out, ingesting paint particles).

Direct pitchforks need go. ignored rest comment, "" Whether airlines tried try immaterial.""


What matters end day rules enforced. Whether airline place lot thought rules, not, immaterial. Trump literally worst superhero villain ever, straight told us plan reduce testing front face... getting away  it‚Äôs latter far people would gotten time, one cluster caused one family. standard, non-hysterical thought outside America. Read papers places (that owned Rupert Murdoch), speak distinguished political science professors even American institutes, likely get agreement nearly everything here. Nuanced agreement, might disagree specifics thought processes, real wave disagreement concept. 

It's truly bizarre America seem aware pretty universally agreed them: they're failed state desperately trying hold rapidly falling empire. delusional boot. AUMF, congress gave responsiblity, Trump define anyone terroist go   job take taxes, hand big companies, keep increasing salaries work 100 days year getting full pay free housing food! 

I think would like move cave far civilization now.  people way like lockdown, masks, social distancing, it. Go back ""normal life"" before. may able enter stores board airplane substitutes both. Good luck! Safe travels!!  kiwis care define 'Americantanga'? I'm guessing Maori suffix added American?

edit: downvoted asking word defined. LOL know make highest rated program time. problem reflect current truth? wearing mask dont need smile (:( girlfriends experience Whole Foods. Apparently much better Amazon bought (big shocker there) treated horribly. really hope pandemic come treatments help dealing long term health problems virus. Well, proved clinically doesn‚Äôt live surfaces March. believe you. I've trying tip extra order to-go extra kind working grocery stores know hell right now.

Yall deserve lot money respect getting right I'm sorry things bad. really hope kind change coming everything Covid shown us proves current society broken af. Grocery stores workers strike store close pay 3 days everyone freaks can‚Äôt get groceries days demand customers wear masks they‚Äôll shut ever coming again. plausible. China recently report one clusters may come imported frozen seafood? seems number outbreaks worldwide involving meat processing plants marketplaces. remember reading study several months ago found coronavirus may survive year freezer. I've diligently wiping (with detergent) frozen food purchased supermarket carefully put freezer. Ouch.... One big grave. Yep, killed edema cytokine storm first 24-72 hours infection, immune systems weakened much secondary bacterial infections able proliferate finish off. gay?? got right, lived 2 years covid, fine. I'm thankful got brexit covid,i ever want see London ever again. grocery store let sister promised hold shirt nose. I‚Äôm sure holding shirt help some, it‚Äôs really funny actually passed mask.

Idk whole thing kind ridiculous guess. You‚Äôre right though, go outside things feel normal (sometimes), wish allowed people following rules though, also help.

We need herd immunity, idiots herd immunity.

Lately idiots saying shit like: 

""But tuberculosis!"" 

""This VIRUS. mask help. know would help? getting exposed built immunity!"" 

""All we're making hospitals go bankrupt fail patients"" 

""Its money grabbing hospitals make millions billions. BILLIONS!"" 

""Oh, already last fall, I'm immune need wear mask"" and

""My mask makes hard breathe. think it, like mask would protect anyways.""

We need pass local short term, automatic sunsetting laws (6m renewed?) fining testing people without masks. positive, increasing fine make felony hazard public health. also free healthcare, great public transportation, living wages, months paid vaccy every year, bicycle infrastructure, free college etc. 

I'm talking 'Murca work two maybe three minimum wage jobs, (rate changed 11 years), barely keep head water.

Lets say single mom two kids feed yourself. go nearest grocery store. live food desert like millions 7-11/Quiky Mart sorta place. Noting cheap junk food miles. 3 mouths feed small amount money spend.

What do? Narrow people get H1N1 - people die far lessor rate got 1918?

The question nothing herd immunity. Thank republicans Upsnoot upboop updoot Women powerful positions, yes meant women power. Quit defining gender bullshit posts.

Oversight issue, argument someone powerful position (because women can't corrupt like men, right?), relaxed oversight measures (just like example cases gave). want more? Equifax?

We relax laws anyone regardless gender/contributions. knew wrong consequences it. mean like... lock entire Huibei province Wuhan, divert entire medical resources China Wuhan snuff virus?

No way man, that's evil communist!! Well world world. fun obviously *can* spread touch, current theory much less likely spreading droplets Test number never come back tropical storm IDK, nurse friend seen healthy 20-something die plain old flu. thing, guessing bad luck hit anyone Personally, wonder actually happen get antibodies enough come tests. SWEAR trying belittle virus, trying understand. always believed scariest part virus EASILY spreads, opposed individually deadly is. 

I also wonder antibody tests tell us anything encountered it? probably guess...

\-------------------------------------------------------------

I work medical field jump wherever see fit... believe bodies ""see"" FAR bacteria viruses actually get us sick anything like that. noses mouths constant battlefields. immune system battling daily multiple fronts. Saliva, mucus, stomach lining, skin cells... then, course, internal immune system stuff see youtube videos about, alien-looking cells shoot bad guys, etc LOL. 

I saying COVID-19 virus get us somehow, tiny amount strong enough immune systems effectively ""stop front door"" kill it. show tests? right? That's people test positive even know right? though shows antibody test (if does) really ""get infected""?

From another angle, test flu get symptoms bad enough decide go doctor. treat accordingly. surely, flu virus get knocked mouth one-day symptom wrote bad dinner, skin, etc. LOT right? would show antibodies? Like, done's studies populations see many people ""been exposed"" something like flu common cold virus outside coronavirus? might bet anyone walks school US November would test positive flu antibody test, lol. guess that's guessing here. 

That seems explain describing way makes logical sense. way saying performing antibody tests create scare tactics falsify virus. real whole LOT people dying. seems like awesome way track learn it! testing using people antibodies help others fighting virus awesome too!

But like say, seems far crazier weird me, think two similar people get ""infected"" virus hospital one end ventilator another even notice. Like, clearly really infect latter person right? make past front door. Man, like watching hunger games... exciting. MUST WORK FASTER! (Only semi joking. hope survives, hope survive, yes I‚Äôd love watch it) E plurbius Unium SEALs surmounted obstacles bring Osama bin Laden justice, would Martin County School system find way provide parents meaningful choice in-person instruction continued distance learning.

The children, I'm reading correctly. must brought justice, give parents tools so. That's surprising since according Fauci New York model state Cuomo everything right. forgetting include one big factor...

&amp;#x200B;

We know many asymptomatic carriers Spanish Flu. know 50% influenza infections today asymptomatic, yet still able shed spread disease. Sick reference bro! American + interested politics + Reddit = smooth brained idiot. try talk reason them, mental capacity understand. idiots, spout idiocy. don‚Äôt see every problem self control clinical addiction. fake ive heard many people said someone died motorcycle accident yet get counted coronavirus death. someone tested negative surgury brain tumor dies later still counted ""coronavirus death"" WTF?

So, said, 1% still significant number viewed millions (10,000 people per million!) still significant chance get non-fatal, problematic symptoms linger months potentially years. guard over-spin death data, trolls seem care death rates seem perfectly fine watch US citizens barely able walk around block 3 months infection. week half ago, monitoring him, there‚Äôs app fill out, bunch visits, it‚Äôs well set study China shutdown entire country like New Years!!! drives much economic activity.

Also none anything said earlier. said there's correlation, fluctuations. proving entire point stupidity topic 

Way go bud seems like death numbers USA stopped going quickly right around time hospitals told start sending numbers directly whitehouse instead via CDC. read whole thing! 

You definitely make really good points agree partisan targeted marketing snippets/articles/etc. way damage help. twisted right neither side debate believe numbers cases/deaths anymore assuming twisting them. There's efforts spent debunking mudslinging either side rather focusing solution.

Yet media still turns around makes sensational headlines claiming pandemic worse despite tens millions fewer deaths  ""One point might speak keeping schools open order reach herd immunity quickly,"" Tegnell wrote email, published Swedish freelance journalist Emanuel Karlsten Wednesday evening.

I know redditors gonna humble next days.          
It's ironic Karlsten vehemently criticized newyorktimes article [so-called errors confirming. would've still significant herd immunity causing spread deaths slow burn, unlike 1918-20 tore least 30% population world once.

I know tried looking sources too, problem we're argument there's lot clear data either way, factors; deadly young people, go, evolve become immune... really clear explanation it. Joe wins doubt corona panic less dramatic. Also antibiotics. It‚Äôs thought many deaths due secondary bacterial pneumonia infection 1918-19. 1% high end estimates. average. divided two groups based last name falls alphabet

still working split kids.. 

it's complicated. 1% way high. lots signals IFR somewhere 0.1% 0.4%. (CDC estimate currently 0.65% although first 0.26%).

1- looking countries massive testings: median CFR countries 20% coverage (tests/population) think almost 1%. know definitely higher bound.

2- Ionnadis et al looked lots Covid-19 IFR research came median IFR 0.24. (google it) 

3- recent studies Indian slums show IFR 0.05% 0.1% (but guess median age places generally young) data also shows counties cities mask requirements saw 15.1% decrease cases four weeks requirements mask mandates place. It‚Äôs overall decrease 34.6 cases per 100,000 time frame, numbers show places without mask requirements experienced 30.4% increase coronavirus cases.

South Carolina #3 hotspot world, ahead countries even. Governor SC didn‚Äôt stand way local municipalities enacting mask ordinances. did. 

The daily case numbers South Carolina rapidly declining. 

In contrast, Georgia allow local mask ordinances, numbers leveled off, declining. plenty people sub who've saying masks permanent fixture society. agree masks short term mitigation technique, even entertain idea around times major pandemic deadlier flu. Obviously individuals choose wear worn sick, like 85% cases (in non Covid times) overkill. Father law started chemo mid March. Every day 15 minutes week radiation, maybe thats way around, regardless every day may 28. I've spent $20 gas since February. Half fucking year read article posted saying people finding covid LA stores LAX. mostly RNA, reason justifies scrubbing fruit soap wiping cereal boxes Lysol wipes eyes sub. There's emerging evidence increased mask wearing correlates drop hospitalization rates. Seriously. hard could first actual win saying this.

I‚Äôll tell you: malice. Biden gets elected? knows....Seriously though possible families get together course one asymptomatic..... exactly!  I'm surprised lower. live urban neighborhood Florida seems like contest pedestrians &amp; cyclists see close get me. I'll cross street avoid people walking toward immediately cross, too! Sounds like trump got you. Someone's gonna pop say America testing UK deaths per million insanely fucking high compared country anywhere, except Belgium. guys #2. not? I'd think connect find zombie movies make sense now. Dude. It‚Äôs pandemic. It‚Äôs disaster, like earthquake fire.

Of course bad news good.

If prefer good news only, check Good News flair. half million people died, it‚Äôs still going strong. don‚Äôt surprised see ‚Äúnegativity.‚Äù Japan community spread human human. kids fine. appointments Feb/March year shutdown late 6mo cleanings. pass info along parent groups though see viable option. Thank you! Highest risk getting infected would flight there. live low population area much contact people. 

My office mate's sister moved family Finland US years ago said infinitely better there. PCR tests surface swabs show presence viral RNA, test whether virus intact (viral envelope -- corona spike proteins). Without viral envelope, RNA infectious since can't get cells. likely fragile viral envelope breaks quicker RNA, positive PCR result necessarily 100% evidence could get sick touching surfaces. open question since Diamond Princess cruise ship, found Covid surfaces 17 day passengers got ship. 

That said, family quarantine mail packages several days, wipe things like groceries. reasons really can't afford get sick. mean false, people large aren‚Äôt going eat don‚Äôt know cook. cook least 5 true meals week home, still gone eat recently. enjoy different food restaurants cook home.

Once required wear oppressed? What? I‚Äôm mask life, I‚Äôm sure lot people bad oral hygiene also happy mask life Buddy think got October. 

I‚Äôll go grave thinking it, even never admit spreading earlier US follow UK's example remove 15,000 deaths overnight (to keep proportion) official toll excuse ""hmm recovered covid died car crashes afterwards, ignore 20,000+ unexplained additional excess deaths"" Croatia, 150 cases one day, government made bars clubs work midnight makes difference lol.

Surely understand experience universal respect difference opinion. ulterior motives, don‚Äôt think wearing mask pain ass many people (outside echo chamber sub) agree me. No, blown proportion get Biden elected. mean yes, yes huge, huge spike. /s 110% board masks, say there's large contingent sub want masks permanent, even Covid control, think people part problem getting others make temporary sacrifices. supervention evil

This needed. 8000 yesterday. 


6000 today. (But reported two hours late, probably confused people). 3.4 million specific antibodys. least one already lost antibodies (they last months) never developed antibodies (t-cell response).

That means amount people already contact virus likely double number. pain ass? medical professional think like cleaning house. usually handle day day cleaning maybe one two messy visitors (low viral load). However 10 messy visitors show would get behind pretty fast (high viral load). answer trump mouth breathers elected freedumbs fetid oligarchs bought office think coming years, see something like that. even read called canatonics Awakenings movie, might Spanish Flu cases, brain damage, became paralized. book even said people mental illiness tiime, might brain damage Spanish Flu. according John Barry book Spansh Flu.  attributing false negative rate inherent PCR tests antibody tests... Makes sense. virus takes tremendous toll anyone vulnerable including undiagnosed issues. Republican politicians saying barely shrouded language since 60's. understand anyone surprised. 

And yes, right wing voters knows coded language too, they're totally OK stripping people rights, property, even lives, means continue bigots racists. half country refuse vaccinated? know half I'm talking about? Thanks yesterday's ""recount"" UK removed 5,300 deaths official toll. that, 0.0680 % would Sun City borders Surprise.

God speed wife, can‚Äôt imagine dealing coworkers top it. don‚Äôt understand. keenly aware tongue's position mouth

Noooooo say Implying Russians also running parliament.

It proven beyond reasonable doubt Putin engineered Brexit. Couple things.

\- Masks impair non-verbal communication. mouth plays essential role conveying emotions.

\- Humans recognize faces. can't build maintain relationship (whether romantic, platonic friendship professional) someone half recognize. There's also safety aspect here, anonymous also lowers bar harm people risk identified caught much lower.  


Mask wearing comes huge psychological social cost. Therefore done overriding safety concerns (like now). no, flu season qualify overriding safety concern.  meAn finds viral rna? [CDC urges in-person learning July 24th 2020 keep repeating zero evidence? one hand hope learn pandemic make changes prevent future one. also hope working home, flexible schedules, empathy towards workers responsibilities, mask wearing sick stick around long run.

Returning tourists. know, people actually live italy ... compares deaths New York City worst part outbreak New York City worst part Spanish Flu. 

It relevant compare worst epicenter got hit earliest hospitals overwhelmed. Right believe death rate halved hospitals part overwhelmed New York, treatments, ? unknown reasons like maybe mask wearing reduces viral load younger people getting infected surviving.

So relevant think paints accurate picture expect going forward. said 675,000 Americans died Spanish flu. Even number dead, probably won't, three times population before. scientist always thought like this. 10 cells replicating replicate slower 1000. Interested seeing actual answer is! vitamin cure covid either. love people say things like ""well trust them."" Given high rate asymptomatic spread, matter trust. shit. I'm sub never wiping groceries. Texas nearly many excess pneumonia deaths COVID deaths? photo accurate. 15-17C one funny temperatures people think freezing go heavy winter coats many others t-shirts shorts. Traditional Auckland winter clothing hoodie shorts, often worn jandals (flip-flops). 

South Africa Southern Hemisphere one largest outbreaks world. vested interest running series (not year, next). someone tests positive, think shut multi-billion dollar franchise?

The thing NBA understands almighty dollar. Fuck man, almost us go Home Depot daily basis. 

The exception rule people work there, we've already established people putting lives line, hence we've calling ""heroes"" past 5 months.

So fuck important Little Timmy goes school? reason can't quarantine every case immediately decisions can't made isolation - negative consequences costs could significant, worse virus itself. No, random controlled study lockdown. time, can't make claims unsupported type study presented. study says associated; claim causation.  reason study assess damage actions do; good kill patient order save him.  Observational studies fine, provided acknowledge limits study telling you. intubation boxes referenced, example, well-intended logically sound, ended increasing exposure health care workers five-fold. **Because vetted proper testing.** What's Hippocratic Oath? First harm? happened. Gates Foundation kicked it. disagree, provide proof making wild assumptions. callous thing say millions people never met. myopic disappointing see this. 

Were Boomers Spring Break Florida? NC colleges opening police breaking large campus partied, recently 400 wearing masks, even mention social distancing. We're steering clear NCSU mixed bag mostly masks, zero social distancing.

Those parents. Grandparents. Mentors. Teachers. Loved ones.

All people meant something gone. saddest part virus undoubtedly claim many lives, many could prevented. cannot wrap head around ""economy important"" people. 

How understand longer goes on, people become sick people die, bigger impact economy deeper long term damage? 

This choice saving economy saving lives. economy taking big hit either way, stabilize impact disease human life, easily economy able rebound. know exactly? friends would like: ‚ÄúBut didn‚Äôt die! Hooray!‚Äù second comment intended another possibility. saying sure it‚Äôs actually reproducing blood chicken, it‚Äôs possibility. chicken infected refrigerated frozen allows virus survive longer. statement surviving fresh blood mostly due knowing long would last opposed hard surface. 

Other animals known get it.
It virus transmitted body, carried blood assume. truth one knows much this, it‚Äôs new virus, cells blood ACE2 receptors, generally susceptible way, it‚Äôs definitely possibility. way [t-cell one thought vascular disease either are. Lockdown made worse. Ehem called necromancy TV station saying found virus? tests showed viral RNA.

The list could go on, don‚Äôt think ol Desantis would like stacks comparison. Gotcha, misunderstood want german source deaths counted pandemics? True, diseases lead morbid obesity.  Yea I‚Äôve definitely weird ass colds I'm sure understand saying. media (Reuters good example) reporting COVID briefings beginning. Unfortunately, great job it. yet first paragraph says:

""*Around 3.4 million people England -- 6% population -- contracted coronavirus*"".

I problem 5th paragraph states:

""But findings significant...""

That fine.

But words stating fact, not. I've already added covid-19 pounds. Fall going tough... Trump wins, Fauci probably put trial. capitalism without consumption. UsE BrAiN. nice sources. good job. WAY WOULD PREDICTED THIS?? That's I'm saying. order food take home. Drastically less risk, even invite people socialize. better restaurant. likely miss produce antibodies sure positive test it.

(I want quit job, need money, anytime soon.)

The misunderstanding phrasing, deliberate accidental, ongoing. World Health Organization said ""Cloth masks keep getting virus."" meant absolute guarantee, questionable would help protect someone room sick. That's different ""Cloth masks keep virus spreading"" meaning everyone wears mask reduce giving infection others, especially yet know sick. statements true -- context. Neither statement absolute, let alone situations. swear read something day hospitalizations Hey guys! said 100 people died COVID, 90 did! So, problem solved! it! hunkering house outside Santa Fe. advice generally vulnerable people stay home. 

The amount time stay home though significantly increased longer delay full saturation herd immunity. latter possible though, thing permanently endemic social distancing policies futile. know argue ""much less."" people dying place without tagged. Conspiracies started ""hospitals lying numbers get funding."" obviously crazy thought, plausible, certain.

I would recommend reading fact check people believe something unless affects personally. *And* want believe it.

My father one people. Autism real know autistic people growing (even though son autism...it must something else). Food allergies real either, know anyone them. Covid's flu.

There actual people think like this. version vaccine though? plenty friends health community sensible still skeptical first release. It‚Äôs something really don‚Äôt want get wrong they‚Äôre rushing market also mulling much they‚Äôre going profit it. It‚Äôs entirely altruistic. ""Alternative facts"". feel like I'm talking bars stupid, talking wanting USb dry country?

 wish city filled potholes quickly filled gap. Oklahoma. CDC director [Robert Redfield noted increase suicides among high schoolers. dont believe rate suicides would occurring didn‚Äôt covid. Fair enough, plays viability viral load. There's much higher viral loads hospital, sick person's bedroom, container grocery store. Okay, went back looked thinking specifically 200K ‚Äúworst case scenario,‚Äù yes seeing millions tossed around early April. Regardless, defense, 200K certainly *low end* ‚Äúworst case scenario,‚Äù said, entering territory. guess best really say point time predictions haven‚Äôt ‚Äùdone things almost perfectly,‚Äù quote Birx. mean, true know way causal link flows, vitamin play roles immune system production cytokine storms. also particularly noted factor respiratory illnesses general. hard believe numbers see notion sick people go outside.  consider disproportionately impacted people darker skin are. Could **just** health inequity? Sure, unusually strong effect suggests bit that. Eighty percent African Americans Vitamin deficient. 

Also, one study mapping mortality latitude, correlates sun exposure, another scientist responded pointing correlation even stronger vitamin deficiency rates latitude.

And one said Vitamin deficiency comorbidty **highest** correlation mortality.  Higher high blood pressure, obesity others.


On, flip side, least one study supports viewpoint.  perhaps, accurate say find evidence support different view existing literature published end April. Yes. hormonal birth control far know, antidepressants.

I think pretty much medication less effective obese.

Surgery also invasive there‚Äôs higher risk infection scarring person healthy weight. Pretty much, obesity ruins everything. Well hear trump admit fucking USPS that‚Äôs something Pune dire straits right wash chlorine? (only semi-joking) Oh people remember one.

- 1918 flu happened following WW1, one happened WW3

- People died lot diseases back too, collectively much accepting mass death. 

- role modle nations back give expectations, enemy deflect blame either. true today

- roaring (19)20s followed 1918 flu, greatest depression follow one.

- importantly, Britain derived global order stayed intact 1918, global order willl change forever due COVID.

Then again, contengent surviving WW3 country longer works, that‚Äôs why. tactics work education system hugely underfunded first place :( People getting mean! I'm surprised Republicans telling people sneeze other's faces spit other's mouths point. agree last sentence many others. would nice group pay testing anyone restaurant staff. try make law like run town rail. guess proves point, 24 years cheated much.

Go vote senile pedophile narcissistic asshole. combination air conditioning lot covid cases. That's still current time, unfortunately. That's worth exploring, thank personal experience! feels like might Trump apologist. maybe merit implications question. So, upvote you.

Imagine scenario:

There Covid deaths. certain percentage Fargo, chance working plant. is, almost certain one die Covid (and sad), possible working somewhere. 

Was death directly caused plant closing? Almost impossible tell. 

On third hand, indirectly, answer yes, plant flying face medical directive indeed blame portion increases positive cases hence deaths Fargo, even one particular. said elsewhere, get US nicer context materially politically whole reason. countries sat mountains oil nothing even close USA did. like modern science; interest data crunching approaching different angles. 

Mean, Median, Mode, removing outliers, etc. give different data review interpret. love stuff. spot on, follows larger trends people fall kind thing. Conspiracies often consumed people want feel smart without going work education. Anecdotally know many people buy mythos surrounding current administration losers general, partake what‚Äôs called basking reflective glory. makes feel special accomplished avoid facing reality failures. believe that's extreme oversimplification. Diabetics appear good health people incredibly high chance dying ""almost anything"" risk. asthmatics, people heart conditions, plenty healthy people 65. 

And *is* terrifying interact anyone risk, terror restricted solely self. People scared unreasonable. lose everything makes identity (ego) could, subconsciously, equated death. death normalcy; reinforced collective reality. 

""Football *has* played, restaurants *have* open, normalcy *needs* return""

But 75 year old Susan dies ""flu"" easily reduced. Florida State ACC. think entire lab leaked virus get China Fauci mid January?

They even contain stupid virus somehow super competent covering everything?

Like underestimating socially connected people china even work labs. There's gonna janitors stuff. Low level people. 

And thing happened. think CIA SAT nothing warn Congress President entire November. December. January February? 

I mean dangerous virus getting lab. would make sense US TREATED Flu Bro long CIA KNEW THIS. NFL going disaster. getting positives bubble. One asymptomic player game over. Yeah something lot people think about. public servant. Curbside pickup sucks.

Last time tried it, sent store 20 miles away without warning, got half stuff, half *did* get wrong bizarre ways (substituted largest size single container smallest, example), include meds, OTC still important.

Just saying, idea shift everyone online curbside garbage. We'd massively increase staffing, would still step down. I'd much rather go even something like reserve grocery shopping time rely someone else understanding *some us like cottage cheese asking two giant cartons mistake, sign problem judge me*. Body shaming absolutely helped me, friends weren‚Äôt absolute dicks body never would gotten ass fix myself. happy did, healthy fit improves literally every aspect life. one saying that. 

You‚Äôre talking incoherent, rambling circles.

I‚Äôm conversation. 

It‚Äôs clear ability add anything conversation beside one point intent stick despite many counterpoints proved initial point meaningless. took 100 years correct fact baked constitution? mean, passed 1865. great grandparents killed Spanish Flu resulted 19 year great aunt (being oldest family) taking running family business help relatives. also cared 5 younger siblings.

It story passed also fact, died winter 1920's low impactful 4th wave. made waves, including going infamous parade Philadelphia fall 1919. 2 people died side big spike Philadelphia October 1918 deaths occurred. Jonathan Swan's painfully confused face entered chat. know people get treated every single day... like it‚Äôs needed.... realise bosnian/Serbian extremist killing archduke occupational force could viewed different way?

and again... bosnia? realize fact military foreign country showing bit ill temper :)? wonder would look things fpreign military occupied country. let's say russia, since seem russian me. would forgiving? would say national country kills russian archduke extremist? pretty sure answer no, honest.

in way, gavrilo princip reason ww1. fact germany wanted part imperialism wanted piece cake themselves. ww2 would happen anyway.

and back story, deserved punishment. like anyone caring world deserves world. *Points almost everything*
Are sure? CO2 affect climate, affect humans? /s hear administration? Silence. Proper advice healthy eating apply different types people also includes excess deaths due second- order effects lockdowns, FYI USA we've 0 Covid deaths. Lol happily. hate still every Saturday honestly probably never cease it. You‚Äôre idiot then. answer question anecdotal data...

 [NYS averaging 600+ new cases day. average 70k+ tests day decreased testing [Florida averaging almost 7000 cases per day. average less 40k tests per [Texas.. look unbelievably transparent. But, reality extremely disheartening. number changed throughout time testing improved. They're longer saying last update end June, update end July yet far know ""excess death?""
i cant...""excess death."" essential people say. I've gone self checkout every time available. Stock night, security, manager coue runners stockers day. Thats really essential viruses mutate. Coronaviruses tend mutate slowly. there's zero evidence different strains virus behave differently meaningful way. remember reading worst case beginning like 2.5 million. anywhere close that. hate take away due packaging ends recycling. ate home outdoor dining opened it‚Äôs lovely going house week nice summer air eating relaxing worrying cooking dealing take away container mess. actually questions, particularly second third links. 

The second one found people never come contact COVID-19 found prtective t-cells. especially think coming contact anumal coronaviruses. 

However, seems true, pandemic right now. Certain animals humans ton contact with, like house cats, catch ton coronaviruses. T-cells gave protection that, anyone outdoor cat would protected. 

For third link, talks finding t-cells large percentage blood donors (as much 50%) COVID-19 existed. gave sort long-term immunity, something like 50% people automatically protected? That's actually see, would mostly keep becoming pandemic see today well. 

Basically, links seem argue T-cells giving much protection. 3 figures. Firstly look England compare England figures UK. 


Excess deaths England 55k, (the 10k 3 countries) 
ONS deaths coronavirus mention death certificate England 49k. 
PHE deaths used government 41k. 


ONS figures best imo. Thanks, too! Exactly. I‚Äôm assured going nail coffin half industry it‚Äôs workers. wish help gov. service industry disproportionately younger. going far reaching affects people industry years something isn‚Äôt done. monetarily, health wise well. shouldn‚Äôt scrapping good public awareness campaign pisses small minority people unique medical condition. Yup. Medical coverage joke. covid -19 causing chronic issues disease people. 

I autoimmune disease. top end medicine disease many others biologic drugs. things, insurance, cost thousands month control disease keep body destroying itself. That‚Äôs huge financial burden millions people. it‚Äôs refused start opted cheapest, lowest cost drug decided try combine lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, supplements). Thankfully mostly control effectively saving $8000/year (my pocket max).  

That‚Äôs something someone survived covid-19 could end facing. worse. think great time Soccer Leagues Europe swoop say hey look we've got sports!! Watch this!   mean, like German league since June great success? Like MLS ran successful tournament? Like NBA pretty much zero positive tests strict policy?

It sounds counterintuitive, kids safer college campuses, reduced student bodies, access health care regular contact versus back hometowns (which spread place) likely around parents grandparents. bump child sized coffins effective way communicate death toll. 1 2,000 Americans die every 3 weeks normally. Stanford study may unravel mystery

Let know *actually* unravel mystery. didn‚Äôt way. didn‚Äôt fucking way. excess covid deaths never counted over-reporting cases counted. consipiracy. virus hit parts world hard people still picking pieces.

Essentially -45% number means past 7 days (so August 5th August 12th), Texas tested, _on average_, -45% less people July 5th July shows testing data Texas. see number daily tests peaked mid-July roughly 67.6k total tests (on July 23rd) August 11th (the recent day data for) 34.9k total tests (a reduction roughly 51%) I'll admit I've stress eating. There's whole lot look forward days, knowing delicious meal future makes less depressed current events. people trying dismiss coronavirus bringing child abuse/human trafficking?

We‚Äôre number one sex trafficking!!‚Äù.

It‚Äôs incredibly stupid. People concerned one thing time. It‚Äôs also dumb it‚Äôs even comparable. Like comparing apples oranges. want start conversation problems, go ahead. don‚Äôt try act like coronavirus isn‚Äôt problem, issues exist. Making ignorant assumption may cost life. um ok, paper since refuse research yourself: fact, map thats built shows diverging paths various covid mutations taking: mean people take care bodies love reaffirmed delaying gratification way eating constantly worth it. 
No one telling obese people lose weight overnight, we‚Äôre literally asking try maintain healthier habits. Also don‚Äôt like normalizing obesity. 

Recent studies indicated antibody responses SARS-CoV-2 drop significantly within 2 months. preprint, Wu et al. analysed antibody responses 349 individuals among first become infected SARS-CoV-2. All¬†antiviral antibody titres significantly increased first weeks disease onset, followed contraction phase, IgM became undetectable around week 10‚Äì13. Importantly, although Spike-targeted IgG (IgG-S) declined time, remained detectable relatively high levels end 6-month study period. IgG-S titres correlated closely neutralizing capacity, although exact correlates protection SARS-CoV-2 still elusive. results suggest antibody responses symptomatic patients COVID-19 follow prototypical progression result sustained memory response, suggesting long-term protective immunity.

Not virus itself. say pneumonia! people consciously try avoid going hospitals despite empty scared hysteria? still death ""due covid""? coments Trump exactly describes behaviour Bolsonaro. every place US running 20% positive rates- pooled testing could effectivly used lots places. people seem forget ""two weeks"" turned three months many people quarantined. shit said evidence. lot EU members closed borders reopened late june Remember outbreak happened week Chinese New years? locked month part contained virus. take year people actually take seriously. course we're going drag economy go shit don‚Äôt disagree that, going happen never cards.

People basically stopped following restrictions first lockdown, already loose enough wasn‚Äôt going describe. would work groups people highly exposed other.

Still unlikely happen. Scandinavian culture naturally social distances. right though, really need lay hammer deniers, Sweden proof (or good get) maintaining healthy distance taking good health precautions wonders maintaining stable infection totals, way herd immunity could actually work (even though thought herd immunity still irks me, current society people making impossible want hopeful could even slightly decent idea) keenly aware tongue's position mouth consciously controlling inhalations exhalations. Also, think I've sitting little long. next time Florida breaks record daily cases, DeSantis roll ‚Äúlab glitch‚Äù excuse. 1. deliberately misreading. There's nothing statement indicating less dense areas threshold around 20%. fact, directly dismiss it. says exact opposite way OP interpreted it. See quoted statement:

If get parking ticket need coat dry cleaning, man!

For anything else I'd go proper Attorney. Saw newfeed morning, nowhere sight Reddit. Hard keep track anymore... *The Telegraph* considered valid news source?

Probably headline...

So everyone arguing 'excess deaths' under-reporting... explain *this*? countries world higher rate testing. one reasons case numbers big places. France, example, tests less half US per capita. places put mask orders social distance orders place. name single place entire world saw herd immunity 20% even 40% directly correlated social distance measures?

Herd immunity happen COVID 60%+. sucks :(. get much since work allowed stay home since original shelter place orders went out. However, anytime do, polite courteous anyone working always been. Part job support work know nice feels interaction starts ends well.

Politeness/kindness literally costs nothing!! Everything Shittier Whittier. AFAIK, immunity (aka healthy person / good immune system) visible form antibodies parent poster tested came negative. know antibody tests significant false negative rate not, that's one explanation. However, seeing many people get kind experience makes hypotheses disease suspect. one thing stands clearly solidly causative. never said didn‚Äôt wear mask, many people don‚Äôt whine saves lives morning. many IU vit average person take eyes bugged head read headline holy shit bring shire lupus steroids helped Covid short... lot shorter usual terms relief. 3 rounds z-packs 3 rounds antibiotics eyes span 4 months.

Edit: tested positive strep time Covid add another round antibiotics. example, go party 100 people (after lockdown) speak 10 people, confirm also speak French. would report 100 people spoke French, would lie. report 100% people asked spoke French. could add would tend suggest people party spoke French. However, could state ""All 100 people party spoke French, findings"", would factually incorrect.

Correct, could report 100% people party spoke french. could however say findings lead believe 100% people party spoke french, assuming 10% people party appeared representative sample 100 people party. 

However, even high percentage population sample, huge difference testing 10 100 people 100,000 56 million. 10/100 100,000/56,000,000, smaller numerator, prone data errors study becomes 10% super small population lot less useful 2% huge population. confidence intervals come play.

I mean, point posting point people (including yourself) understand data science, made point.

But think problem making statements like this, think problem people knowing read them. put quite bluntly, there's reason scientists publish findings scientific journals inside pack Bazooka Joe tests says Aladeen? I‚Äôm sick timeline many tests, we'd far fewer cases... 


USA #1!!! \*squinting\* Well *look* like person would virus, so... makes think can‚Äôt happen? Superintendent Otott principal Gabe Carmona need ~~fired~~ arrested ASAP

FTFY.

They're endangering welfare children, starters. straight criminal negligence. Here's get - people think government mass surveillance (they are) ones think government wants us wear masks forever. making far difficult use facial recognition track us. 1% people dying like you, I'd agreement. Unfortunately, good people dying, too.  need arrested tried crimes humanity

even Adolf Hitler stupid Testing place, positives remain normal.

That's objectively false statement. look 7 day averages, positive rate Texas gone 11.5%  sure got downvote this, definitely evidence proving correct. thing happens children parents die; happens everyday. matter illness, car accidents, etc. delusional think people care people professions person, common human decency.

But yes, world majority people treat others based arbitrary sense accomplishment usefulness instead character personality, majority people scum. what's cfr covid? people disinfect packages instead, lol. regardless people say new virus, still follows Farr's method wherein cases deaths generally bell curve cases time frame. 

Now, mean entire nation bell curve localized areas is. Le orange said ""And see disinfectant knocks minute. One minute. way something like that, injection inside almost difference is, he's trying prove hospitalizations happen, proved verifiable anecdotal evidence. They're trying prove hospitalizations never happen among youth, proven people low symptoms, proves always happen.

I could say Chicken Pox worse flu... context? Mortality? Infectivity? Pain?

It could number things, could safely assume I‚Äôm meaning infectiousness. However, wasn‚Äôt clear context. Imagine sars outbreak times, one would notice looking something likes seen since great depression. take least decade recover from, hell took obamas entire presidency recover 08 financial crisis. looking many magnitudes greater said done. would call twin cities ""world class."". folks saying would get better summer, completely ignoring fact summer countries first wave occurred. Honestly I'm long show old movies. Going screening Frankenstein 1931 Halloween something (obviously post-vaccine world) Universal theater would pretty sick. think would actually make people want go movies bc know movie they're going see good entertain crowd opposed to... well, modern movies headline generalized specific either. point still stands, would need 10 years covid catch spanish flu. think it‚Äôs today probably way try get people go theater. think they‚Äôre playing classics popular movies, necessarily new releases Okay. Let's simple exercise exponential growth.

Assume hospitalization trends real cases doubling roughly every four weeks (based Texas excess deaths June-July chart since believe number). Let's say optimistically 100 ICU beds currently 60 pts June. stay average 2 weeks. Let's make clean assume new pts come 2 weeks wave also. Mid June ok, 60 left 60 came. Beginning July, beds (120/100). put together 40 beds hallway converting surgery beds, even though actually staffing run ICU beds. looks like beds available! 120/140. Except know 20 40 realistically run ICU beds *while fucking clinical staff*. ok July.

So admit replacements real 120 beds. pt coming without one 120 kicking bucket? Divert go home infect family. Meanwhile sort expect 120 new pts August die home. numbers look great! 20 free beds! Listen, can't look that. testing. Look charts. testing anyone.

The Finnish government announced recommend people use face masks parts country confined spaces social distancing possible, including public transport effort slow spread coronavirus country.

Prime Minister Sanna Marin (SDP) said press conference Thursday government backed recommendation National Institute Health Welfare THL use face masks situations possible avoid close contact regions Finland except North Karelia, East Savo, south central Ostrobothnia.

The recommendation apply children aged 15 health reasons wearing mask.

There uptick epidemic recent weeks, many cases originating travel outside Finland. Thursday 41 cases confirmed, highest daily total announced THL since May.

In face mask recommendation, THL notes evidence benefits masks still strong, even small public health benefits warrant use. According recommendation, proper use face mask reduce infections preventing droplets spreading environment therefore justified.

Masks should, principle, paid individuals themselves, municipalities ensure poorest vulnerable receive free charge. According Marin, state reimburse municipalities costs related providing masks residents.

Taking account number confirmed infections, recommendation force time regions Uusimaa, Southwest Finland L√§nsi-Pohja hospital district northwest.

The recommendation applies public private sector jobs, Marin stated.

""Traffic light model"" traveller testing

At request government, National Institute Health Welfare prepared ""traffic light model"" testing arrivals high-risk countries.

Individuals arriving Finland high-risk ""red light"" countries likely extensively tested may placed mandatory quarantined health officials. Testing may also mandatory, discretion local health officials, blanket political decision made matter.

Voluntary quarantine deemed sufficient arrivals less high-risk ""yellow light"" countries, need voluntary quarantine countries given green light. Countries designated green category fewer eight infections per 100,000 people, Prime Minister Marin said.

Still good see science behind though ... Antibodies Covid stick blood weeks. become undetectable tell someone Covid looking cells.

So anyone Covid prior late April/early May (when spike) showing antibody test. People minimal asymptomatic illnesses would lost antibody presence even shorter time frame.

*One studies found 10 percent nearly 1,500 COVID-positive patients registered undetectable antibody levels within weeks first showing symptoms, 74 patients found typically lost antibodies two three months recovering infection, especially among tested positive asymptomatic.*

Sweden looked blood donor samples found twice many showed positive covid May looked cells plus antibodies.

*One interesting observation wasn‚Äôt individuals verified COVID-19 showed T-cell immunity also many exposed asymptomatic family members,‚Äù says Soo Aleman. ‚ÄúMoreover, roughly 30 per cent blood donors who‚Äôd given blood May 2020 COVID-19-specific cells, figure that‚Äôs much higher previous antibody tests shown.‚Äù*

All UK survey basically tells us 6% (at least) Covid within past couple months. probably missing got sick peak.

Bearing mind Sweden hit least 30% May, similar per capita death rate (both 1/1700), we've probably like 40-50% post infected. 6%. plug ancient centurylink one sitting box garage use one like common sense something Two week wait time much South -- well except HS football team. LOL calling guy twitter personality. idea is, looked up. data seems solid. Texas outlier basically stopped testing makes much harder know what's truly going on. definitely open question. Ha.

...and astronomically better medicine flow information. 

We much better prepared today‚Äôs world, night day, bring death rate much lower number 1918.

But reality can‚Äôt.

Why?

Because virus serious threat.

If means 1918 medicine death toll right would scare shit you. people would rather complain someone change lives change themselves. It‚Äôs unpopular opinion stand by.

Nowhere say disrespect people. said suck something different. always get chuckle posts people like coming help they‚Äôre digging graves comfort them. Infusing hospitalized Covid-19 patients blood plasma people recovered disease appeared show benefit nationwide study, study‚Äôs lack placebo group left several experts struggling interpret data.



The study, enrolled 35,000 patients, found quickly administering so-called convalescent plasma marked effect mortality patients severe cases Covid-19. received transfusions within three days diagnosis seven-day death rate 8.7%, patients got plasma four days mortality rate 11.9%. difference met standard statistical significance.



But without placebo group comparison, it‚Äôs unclear valuable treatment might be. study, run Mayo Clinic sponsored National Institutes Health, meant broaden access convalescent plasma. part known ‚Äúexpanded access program,‚Äù designed definitively test well treatment works get patients collecting data.



In statement, Mayo Clinic said Food Drug Administration advised expanded access program continue ‚Äúwhile planning way transition smoothly Emergency Use Authorization convalescent plasma.‚Äù



Peter Bach, director Memorial Sloan Kettering‚Äôs Center Health Policy Outcomes, said there‚Äôs way sure ultimate benefit convalescent plasma, study ‚Äúchecks boxes.‚Äù one, supports overall theory convalescent plasma might help patients, said. noted researchers also found quality plasma infusion effect patient outcomes, got infusions particularly rich antibodies fared better overall.¬†




‚ÄúIf done randomized controlled trials, would know answers still guessing at,‚Äù Bach said, noting authors study ‚Äúappropriately cautious.‚Äù



The results study were¬†published Thursday preprint server, meaning **have yet peer-reviewed.**


The study enrolled high proportion critically ill patients, 52% intensive care units 28% requiring mechanical help breathe. 60% study participants male. Roughly half patients white, 38% Hispanic, 19% Black, 4% Asian. study classified quarter patients ‚Äúother unknown.‚Äù



The concept behind convalescent plasma, dates back century, blood patients recovered infection rich antibodies it, making plasma effective treatment. host pharmaceutical companies developing lab-grown Covid-19 antibodies would work much way, many vaccines development meant spur production similar antibodies would prevent infection first place.



As doctors around world scramble find effective therapies Covid-19, studies like one present enticing data little address clinical guesswork physicians face treating disease.



‚ÄúIt raises question strength evidence necessary treat pandemic,‚Äù said Harlan Krumholz, director Center Outcomes Research Evaluation Yale New Hospital. ‚ÄúThe problem yet resolve sufficient evidence change treatment paradigm.‚Äù



Steven Nissen, noted clinical trialist Cleveland Clinic, agreed: ‚ÄúThe lack high-quality trials making clinical decisions treat patients coronavirus infection national embarrassment. another non-randomized study, NIH-funded, uninterpretable.‚Äù

Yeah except Covid deaths occurred ~5 months, 3 weeks. round 5 months 20 weeks rough math that's like 15% increase baseline due Covid. Teachers students would die, risk willing take IMHO we've know b/c data NY state NYC relatively comprehensive outbreak large.

Last checked, antibody testing says one-in-four NYC'ers virus (and may underestimate b/c early infections may still antibodies). 8.4m population, means 2.1m infections. We've 23,610 confirmed probable deaths, meaning 1.1% fatality rate. Hopefully lower places going forward b/c treatments improved hospitals overrun... 

You also look data set NY state outside NYC, done weeks, pretty close spot fatality rates.

Can also see detailed info age, etc. used also detailed info comorbidity factors, see anymore.

 weeks would. wouldn't. Nothing what's done now. take P100 filters, point still stands though.

Accumulation contamination surfaces pretty much guaranteed respiratory droplets fall suspension, concentration always going larger airborne viral load, due surface smaller dimension volume, fact total viral load continuously integrated three days instead hours. exactly seasonal colds common flu typically spread far beyond direct interaction infected person. also explains even basic masks reduce community spread - dramatically limiting form surface accumulation. 
 
But actual contact tracing efforts suggest pretty rare get infected secondary contact object surface. time, R0 rate definitely matches closely cold flu truly airborne viruses like Polio. what's deal? possible virus infectious picked surfaces, *very* infectious inhaled directly. often surprisingly impressed levels creativity conservatives go maintain cognitive dissonance. applied imagination energy areas lives though could actually see huge improvements. college athletes distilled to...a ~~commodity~~ farm league.

Indeed, according [covid Basically real life Connor 4 Real without redeeming qualities. Viral load many viral particles got exposed to. viruses viral load time exposure makes difference sick get (for example flu). others, virus replicates fast particles viral load make much difference (for example, norovirus). first assumption covid infectious, probably like norovirus, simple threshold making sick not. scientists leaning toward idea viral load matters outcome. That's masks probably making difference hospital rates mortality -- portion mask wearers get sick masks suits armor -- least mask reducing viral load hence disease severity. Again, you‚Äôre reading articles. 

They‚Äôre comparing mortality rates, death tolls.

I weep can't afford to. vast majority. That's Fauci keeps popping headlines about. People may stay home thinking flu never find get COVID late. 


It may get harder get tested people flu symptoms may want test caution. So, going long winter matter picture it. According [this test positivity around 3% less. I've used Texas example there, site data states. I've similar similar experience. family went town visit dad's parents Maryland. ended getting covid along way obviously stay parents due risk, headed back home quarantine. 4 people vehicle wide age group way back, 7 hour drive none caught covid. said even hugged talked parents got (he feeling sick time) they've also tested negative. he's recovered now! don‚Äôt think specifically ‚Äúwomen power‚Äù issue. Men power guilty thing. I‚Äôm sure point trying make, gender-based argument isn‚Äôt it. right skeptical try best understand data (""Your Right Know: Let public see COVID-19 data""). Occam's razor, paraphrased statements like ""the simplest explanation likely right one"", favorite principle me.

Use Occam's razor see leads you. Including teachers principals. Nah, burkas accentuate ankle nuts. sure. feel really bad folks gonna lie... That's another country say sure. hand, talking completely add. there's that. add? nothing? commenters pointing out, many states federal government continuing fuck right thing politically expedient people charge. don‚Äôt mean harsh , comment sounds like wishful thinking. optimist thinks flu season way weaker year social distancing mask wearers.

Why? TATs poor quarantine faster could get test results back.

Also exposed immediately getting tested gives people false negatives, need wait 3-5 days exposure accurate testing, people wasting tons tests.

We cut whiny karens wanted get tested every week, demand may still high, right reasons. Testing right people quickly (ie exposures correct time, nursing homes, healthcare workers, etc) important us blanket testing everyone clogging infrastructure. work within system, help national level ease backlogs testing (swabbing creates tests). example, could thousands tests week...but need supplies made Europe, backlog those, looks like less testing, really capacity actually dropped. 1918, doctors nurses technology now- ventilators, negative pressure rooms, advancements PPE diagnostic technology, ability track virus, collaborate colleagues around globe treatments medications real time like doctors today.

Yet, 1918-1921 Spanish Flu killed estimated \~620,000 US alone. February Now, six months, Covid killed 170,000. No, current median estimate 13% one higher side. Epidemiologists throwing 4-8x number seen three times already lab, person positive months ago gets PCR positive test later date. don‚Äôt BSL-3 lab, can‚Äôt grow confirm.

Unfortunately Americans almost point killing directly politics/polarization media adversarial Gov. kill total could 500,000 country would react much. killed 1 million Iraq Afghanistan via war, sanctions bombings one even batted eye. think Americans would react much unless 20 million dead. way simplistic evaluation. looked Sweden's numbers making leap faith attributing presumed results lockdowns. One could easily pull example countries poorly lack ""draconian"" approaches.

If agree past tense wrong, must agree drawing conclusions prematurely well. COVID flare ups. isn‚Äôt magical response difference EU vs US sub issues, think fixation America one them. America's #1 Covid cases. mention America comment, described issue global. Young people worked retail. one wants guy cant imagine ticket prices going be.

Your avoidance sun caused problem. study done showed men avoided sun consistently likely develop skin cancer moderate exposure. idea low levels UV help create buffer small amounts melanin. avoidance made problem worse needs be.

Patients pre-screened, must wear face covering sanitize hands entry. treatment rooms barriers stop aerosols spreading areas office installed surgical-grade air purifier. yeah totally insane. CDC tracks deaths, historical averages many deaths happen per week, per state adjust changes like population. amazingly consistent usually accounts well states common predictable causes death. spike deaths higher predicted, usually indicates cause, new virus like now. states, new deaths higher average properly getting attributed Covid. Like NYtimes article shows, excess deaths would expected counted Covid numerous reasons, probably due fact there's huge spikes deaths, greater 50% average week, gets reported systems overwhelmed inadequate testing capacity. 

Well, Pennsylvania July, state reporting many confirmed cases Covid, deaths. CDC excess death data indicates indeed many deaths higher average July whatever reason attributed Covid. That's unusual, except closer 90+% excess deaths confirmed covid deaths, there's states showing big difference. also sustained 4+ weeks making less likely simply data lag error. Considering 4000 deaths, pretty significant difference. 

Basically confirmed cases count graph went 700 cases day falling large peak april(1400 cases/140 deaths day), reported covid deaths reported continued fall (700 cases,~15 deaths day). excess death data (~100 excess deaths day) indicates something going wrong reporting, something else killing thousands people. head, sort moral crusade tear apart person's comment for...no reason all? Chill out. ""We can't get caseload control without fast, widespread testing, can't achieve fast, widespread testing high caseload.""

Bc that's definitely *not* ended mess first place. actual antibodies get dosed patients made mice. mice used discovery antibodies. antibodies get put people made cell lines. coronaviruses much less common. 10-15% colds coronaviruses. Many people therefore coronavirus past 5 years.

The study said animal coronaviruses, human ones, cause T-cells. 50% people automatically protected, would make sense. looks like little 20% population hotspots antibodies. may people infected. there's 50% T-cells coronavirus, adding 70% - herd immunity.

There situations everybody large group became infected. highly unlikely 50% people automatically protected. actually know many people catching it. still lot learn many people protected due T-cells coronaviruses, also COVID-19 infection bring immunity T-cells instead antibodies.

The links basically show people T-cells. seem show T-cells confer immunity. fact, suggest opposite virus would spread easily half population automatic protection. UK, seeing serious outbreaks pop places serious outbreak before.

That mean t-cells that's causing it. notice phenomenon, can't assume know makes sense you. That's science work. I'm looking actual studies done see confer immunity, can't find any. Grow up... stop asking simply cite source? serious?

I'm FAR worried car accident way theater. While, understand still early gotta move fast community information but, lot information high quality.

I seen linked threads clicked here, almost fail convince actual investigation issues. Let's take ""Study Links Long-Term Heart Damage...""

Here easy simple questions answered article not.

- selection criteria patients?

- heart damage measured compare population wide statistics, prior pandemic?

- compare pathogens damage, Flu also known cardio damage?

- likely damage permanent, and/or criteria use claim damage give relative value important. (Heart attack XXX YYY, ZZZ average Heart Attack).

The journalism around poor almost valuable information get, might bad. really new information.

Again, read every one read left basic questions someone journalism able do. virus months, still getting information like March. think mean fomite. Yeah something get paid work... unemployme- nah, nevermind man! They‚Äôre lucky income! Sort reminds people saying ‚Äúbeing slave better slaves before!‚Äù Removed facts sometimes offense hurts reddit's ad sponsors. COVID-19 deaths could literally increase 1000% still small fraction deaths 1918.

That insanely stupid comparison is. like comparing double homicide Holocaust. getting backwards. lower ""starting"" baseline, outsized impact X number deaths fixed X. this, virus relatively smaller fatality rate (COVID-19) impact low baseline mortality (2020) heavily pathogen relatively higher fatality rate (1918 flu) would impact high baseline mortality (1918).

Assume fixed population. Let's say 100,000,000. Scenario A, baseline mortality 50,000 (a high number, like 1918). Scenario B, baseline mortality 20,000 (a low number, like 2020).

Give Scenario virus kills 5,000 people. Like 1918 flu, relatively higher IFR. Holding baseline mortality constant, total mortality 55,000. excess mortality rate 110%. (55000 / 50000)

Now give Scenario B virus kills 2,500 people. Like COVID, relatively lower IFR. hold baseline constant end total mortality 22,500 excess mortality rate 112.5%.

The excess mortality rate Scenario B higher one Scenario even though Scenario got weaker virus. That's point study getting - we're used people dying, even though COVID-19 nasty 1918 flu, ramp-up mortality harsh relative starting point.

COVID-19 would certainly worse 1918 today, would better Spanish Flu Spanish Flu today would worse (a *lot* worse) COVID-19. school equivalent shutting water tight doors Titanic. helps stopping ship sinking. mean. supporters like ""he says means""? sure recent UK IFR: (Click IFR tab select ""age"") iT‚Äôs fLu personal level, yeah you‚Äôre right. really think governments say ‚Äúeh don‚Äôt get vaccinated RIP‚Äù open again?

I think much gradual phased process, something like reopening phases - instead ‚Äúx% positive test rate‚Äù ‚Äúx% population vaccinated‚Äù hit next phase. Simply governments don‚Äôt want liable outbreaks shouldn‚Äôt surprise people. reason social isolation used punishment even prison. ain‚Äôt good us. people wonder excess deaths higher C-19 death count. This, combined substance abuse mentioned article increase alcohol consumption would good start explaining gap.

Thankfully, since USA opened, overall mortality fallen hard. title say covid-19 deaths since May, simply ‚Äúdeaths‚Äù Seems kind daywalker-esque me. happened World War I, overshadowed it. time, countries around world report it, stop enemies thinking weakened it.

It also happened time disease epidemics killed lots people common, stand much today. Oh god sad. Yeah good point, Putin's basically James Bond villian would real life. mean, instructor part equation somewhat bogus. make 1.5 students' worth tuition teaching 23-student class. objectively net positive budget, large one that. likely see total deaths run trend rest year, since good portion died covid19 old/sick would died year anyway. essence covid19 ""pulled forward"" deaths first half year. Hi. work one Harris County sites, people want get tested Harris want similar wait times go new surge sites (Pridgeon/San Jac) results supposed (I know, know) 3-5 days. Right now, system went 7-9 days certainly longer 2+ weeks ago testing sites operating capacity. 

The labs going process hospital tests, presumptive symptomatic get around everyone. 

And FWIW people stopped whoing Harris sites. 80% reduction people showing last weeks site. Covid didn‚Äôt make choice go lockdown refuse certain medical care people. People made choice.

What you‚Äôre missing brain. Quote article:

""Similarly, data Citymapper phone app, helps people plan travel routes, suggests travel Stockholm fell 40 per cent normal level. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs substantial reduction,‚Äù says Martin McKee London School Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, whose team analysis.

theyre idiots. absolutely stupid people fined thousands wearing mask. People seriously aggressive whole mask thing, make ""medical excuse"" wayyyy strictly defined idiots cant claim medical excuse cant wear mask. Interesting - would like read actual studies though, get time. derm suggested pool beach, don‚Äôt put sunscreen 15-30 minutes.. also recommends vitamin supplementation. certainly won‚Äôt stop supplementation, since still think it‚Äôs proves useful. blood work done last winter showed healthy range, taking supplementation. Obviously, getting sun exposure important. No. COVID lethal would contained already. problem COVID large number a/oligosymptomatics makes bull contain. stop kids.

People western NY take NYC's success granted. panic? probably 14 neighborhood. Thanks governor DeSantis. never liked positivity rate metric. It‚Äôs dependent amount testing, highly variable, selectiveness getting tested, also highly variable.

It indeed good measure, high indicates quite clearly something amiss. US currently positivity rate 8%. That's one highest world. Definitely highest developed countries. countries 2-4% range. ones better 1%. Even like South Korea highly selective testing. work grocery store spot on. continually cutting hours raising expectations. People burnt know atleast 2 people stepped full time position part time one stupid workload. 

They make sure make known essential workers, position could filled day two willing play ball. Feels like expendable point.

Louisville 500 cases yesterday half reported state. Yes, we're biggest city, come on. let's shove 23,000 drunk entitled people Churchill Downs. Umm... who‚Äôs feeling comfortable? doesn't.

Firstly, missing point. countries failed prevent vulnerable people getting virus; vulnerable people *more likely* exposed average person.

And cases, result insane policies actively caused harm. example, New York Britain sent infected nursing home patients hospitals back nursing homes, able cause bigger outbreaks. impossible avoid that.

Secondly, treatments massively improved time. areas 1% IFRs hit *early*, doctors know treat virus. better treatment protocols drugs confirmed decrease deaths, resulted huge improvements terms number hospitalised people survive. another place patient demographics similar outbreak now, they'd much lower IFR better treatment. .....shitshow petri dish....... one place USA default.

You‚Äôre alcoholic drink three drinks week. yes lot people struggle alcohol enjoy beer watching hockey game doesn‚Äôt make alcoholic. participated trial- honest make clear accurate individual basis think would mean much I'd rate 10. (when asked rate 1 10 responded)

* Also President always ask people though 9/11 big deal. mean less 3,000 people died country millions, that's basically nothing. Worked market basket 3 years left right Covid confirm soul crushing job I'm sure supply chain really equipped amount testing that's needed. much private hands iirc there's fast manufactured. American here. national lockdown. federal government put onus state governments enforce lockdown. state governments shifted responsibility local governments. It‚Äôs inconsistent. 

My state lockdown 90 days seeing drop cases opened back quickly. mask mandate many people think violates ‚Äúpersonal freedom‚Äù asked wear mask. It‚Äôs big mess IMO. Oops, I'm thinking Mypos used work retail. You‚Äôre holding line causing numbers go down. Cashiers quota many items per hour ring up. Thank god kids school district going virtual least thru Christmas going mention too. remember scrubbing early 1990s; dental rolls stuck nose keep snot running face soaking mask. head ophthalmology got sick next float RN ( ran eye room small ACS Texas).....calling sick FROWNED upon, worked operating room!

It same, worse, clinic technician. seems ALWAYS getting sick, spite washing hands million times day (ok, exaggerate, ya know...a LOT! ) America's entire pandemic strategy pro-business- dont even try avoid getting infected, ignore do. isnt even herd immunity strategy. True. Given China repeatedly complaining food imports COVID it, NZ suspecting reinfection due shipping container, surfaces remain viable avenue transmission, despite CDC says. Trump claims vaccine works. replaces people regulatory boards gets approved, makes campaign issue people say worried safety, it‚Äôs attack him. claims left likes virus makes look bad, proof vaccine skepticism. That's true (Mountain Day Monday, Obon today, excluding Tokyoites celebrated Obon July guess). 

But puzzles positivity holding steady falling slightly. 7-day running average 6.9% 8/8 8/10, yesterday fallen 6.4%. backlog test requests building up? recall back May(?) NHK looked lag test requested test performed found wards/cities Tokyo, lag several days growing. Since then, came back down, heard updates. way track metric? Eh, really, covid around long enough surprise started see handful outliers catching again. Immunity duration (like things) bell curve 10s millions confirmed infected makes 1 million outlier curve likely crop up.

The fact really seen start happen yet indicates there's still plenty time left immunity. Who's balki?

Your post one entitled, *woe me*, self-centered, hypocritical things I've ever seen Reddit. Right now, zero chance realize actually. ever happens, months, maybe even years now. 

 f****** sacrifices

You've living first world dream 90% Reddit, audacity say that. Unbelievable. know what's fucked up? Nothing really changed arent hiding feel. Unique time world identifying stupid never easier Silver lining might get worse get better, might slow path getting better twisted way. employees wearing masks customers wearing masks employees near them, risk outdoors still extremely low.

I‚Äôve eaten pandemic, outdoors, don‚Äôt see unsafe. tables ~15 feet apart, server never got within 6 feet us except dropping food, wore masks‚Äîwith obvious exception meal, nobody near us.

I see reason disallow this. restaurant takeout, ~$50-100 minimum/person French restaurant. won‚Äôt make without limited dine-in; nobody wants pay takeout. Dude even saying things might related? Yeah lot people getting PCR tests hospital time, track viral levels, would still recent test results. Ohhh. Thank opening YouTube bingewatching repritoire! wearing one early on. Well early could get one, two weeks lockdown. got weirdest looks. Yeah mean imply thought going long term, read it...

Unfortunately think point many governments including mine less inclined ‚Äúrequire‚Äù (my municipality still requires public transport city owned facilities - won‚Äôt vote public places end August...üôÑ) go back individual based decision well seen pans am. lol mask absolutely protect me. jackasses low zero empathy others. means they're exactly type people think hoax overblown. Okay botter Could find link FDA list article. Probably buried among ads. link. Sadly, think so. 

I think next 100 years, pandemics, even dangerous. diseases waiting permafrost melt, Covid-19 might drop bucket. 

But people (if left) might read shit got rolling. read 2020 great things came range symptoms virus cause completely bizarre, think comes new - we're seeing like common cold reached North America. population that's exposed virus generations, people fight relatively easily left. new population, Russian roulette.

I'm happy infected, may particular immunity either. Ultimately catch get enough virus you, maybe luck skill (keep following PPE protocols!) avoided far. good parents asked won‚Äôt go anymore, said data started going White House I‚Äôm treating it‚Äôs match I‚Äôm locking down. many people die reason trumps fragile ego. Earth u/TotalWarFest2018, come in. copy?

Take wild guess. Hint: rhymes Global Pandemic. bought mask protect respirator going lot better shitty surgical mask. us plan getting sick all. think accept similar level deaths one worst events human history? 

There massive difference war like WWII virus. Theres benefit risking lives here. argument war country world would better due sacrifice made millions soldiers fighting enemy. Though course many Soviet soldiers killed due actions leaders. sacrificing millions lives 2020? economy fucked either way, people concerned lose jobs spending money. smart thing fight kill virus quickly possible life go back normal people dead possible. 

A death rate 1 50 means people know die. 

What toughen even mean context? ignore risks wait catch virus? I'd prefer continue kill virus.  2% dieoff would castastrophic change world society. know that's saying, go back speeches 5-6 years ago world difference. Also, would claim VP needs ready take health concerns? Lets real here, healthy. Come Western Australia, personally show around! people, yes. 40 million unemployed afraid covid they're going pay rent next month? Shut fuck snowflake. said pain ass. pain ass, going keep using it. Things black white like you‚Äôre trying portray here, go pc circlejerk shit somewhere else Come Prague, cheap living, great transportation still us work contract live like king here. Source: lot America expats gf expat American. Slovak Yes. Apparently anyone say unsubstantiated opinions people believe truth. president slanders others without backing claims significant number people believe words. exposes inherent biases stupidity.

Different things different. helllooooooooooooooo...... elllooooooo! 600 decreased level, feeling see drop coming months well Got it, thank clarification.

We know Nick Cordero Flu Covid concurrently, think anything hard hit him, think things go Flu season? Found Sinophobic bigot. might misreading me, that's concern. disagree mask orders regular flu season principal. Yup, reason phishing emails written poorly. They're designed weed slightly gullible favor hopelessly gullible stupid. specifically, news articles sub stating ""NECK GAITERS BAD SAYS DUKE!"" misinformation.

We can't assume 1 study sample size 1 neck gaiter made 1 material scientific basis ""ALL NECK GAITERS BAD!""

If bad it, c'mon test one, news propagating misinformation get exciting headlines Pardon , USA , People hell bent sending kids school ? 12% recovering? News flash, construction figure 9/11 every days. willing anything prevent one 9/11, person refused fight Covid hailed Messiah. anti-Christ. starting wonder antidepressants causing sociopathic behaviour. People believe anything, even there‚Äôs 0 proof, people stupid. would expect least ten deaths per day population drawn evenly population. Kids disproportionately tested due less severe symptoms, elderly care homes hit hard. could easily expect 30-40 deaths per day population unrelated events point.

The country HUGE, unmitigatedly disastrous initial surge March/April/May, pushed quite bit. reached point expected unrelated deaths among positives order actual deaths caused virus, continue getting useful data need start making choices categorization. takes smell away Cant... Borders closed due covid handling...

&amp;#x200B;

But lucky open time yopu finish red tape Sorry nonsense. review ordered well publicised Oxford report pointed never recover, lead large amounts criticism. done whim reduce deaths. 

This line Scotland many EU countries. Scotland using 60 day metric, death toll past month would 250 0, yet one complaining they've using along. 

The affect apparent, unsurprisingly, recent weeks- death toll drop 75% past week. 

And anyway, still published are: 
-excess deaths 
-Deaths covid certificate 
-deaths 60 days positive test Covid certificate. 

Yes excess deaths important, given excess deaths currently negative, metric still value. undoubtedly die longer 28 days, picked final metric. sound right. car accidents, people driving many times every single day. chance death single outing car lot less chance death single bout coronavirus. Otherwise, think life expectancy would drop something like 50 years people drive cars every day. Food trade mitigates natural disasters though. drought one country import food another. tried true way combat disease social distancing masking up.

You keep repeating even though true holes continue poked daily.

Social distancing:

 *Two patients in¬†the hospital room study. One patient coronary artery disease swab test COVID-19 positive. second patient admitted four days prior, testing positive time. air sampling done, second patient tested negative process discharged.*

*The air samplers positioned 2 4.8 (6.6 ft., 16 ft., respectively) away patients viable virus isolated air samples. words, researchers said virus particles able travel 16 feet hospital room.*

***‚ÄúFor aerosol-based transmission, measures physical distancing 6 feet would helpful indoor setting would provide false sense security,‚Äù study authors wrote.***

This concluded researchers ~~Heritage Foundation~~ University Florida

&amp;#x200B;

And Masks: published ~~OAN~~ Washington Post referencing study Duke University

 

 *‚ÄúIt‚Äôs case mask better nothing,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúThere masks actually hurt rather good.‚Äù*

*Other types face coverings may fall category bandanas knitted masks, study found. An* [*N95 mask exhalation valve* failed measure up.*

Masks SD mitigation tools give hospitals time treat come COVID. always been. Science even says so. Listen science. wearing mask makes one slave? Uh, that's piss poor logic. UFC fighters complaining pay. put much wear tear bodies get tiny portion event revenues. challenge compounds people rely easy digest infographics hastily intentionally misleadingly cobbled together trolls, edgelords, nefarious actors web disseminated tight knit echo chambers maximum effect.

These people look gaps, faults, errors, omissions scientific data justification arguing, ""See?! trust *them?!""* offering nothing tweets, memes, youtube propaganda videos counter scientific consensus. 

They understand science allowed wrong. fact wrong testing new solutions problems testing every new variable may present exactly science works, people get that. get never actually lived world truth answers come us talking burning bush picture person claims doctor's tweet. hostile foreign actors weaponizing resistance listen facts, nurturing arrogant ignorance, cause damage society possible, getting hell return investment front. Interesting. Source? every case virus detected packaging, phrasing always explicitly uses ""packaging"" ""outer packaging"" (ÂåÖË£Ö/Â§ñÂåÖË£Ö). Yeah hope so. would need keep buying masks every year? washable ones work year something? masks, people talk, even wear masks move mask talk, virus fly's everywhere. sub needs rule going make scientific claims coronavirus, **you must provide source**. 39, one mysteriously fell window quoted on. Cases rising, hospitals overwhelmed heartland, hope proud yourself. fear dangerous actual virus, right? I‚Äôm saying virus isn‚Äôt dangerous, weak argument someone saying ‚ÄúThe virus isn‚Äôt dangerous. know two people barely symptoms.‚Äù always treated like dogshit. we‚Äôre expected risk health well, hazard pay anything besides grunt thanks there. Work never personal health Well Danish. ""Den spanske syge."" much use guess, unless plan learn Danish. think rate 2% probably India Brazil end unfortunately. developed nations it'll closer UK numbers. Still way high.

Brazil India much younger populations UK Italy. (31 26, vs 41 46). Given heavily skewed Covid fatalities toward older people (65+ especially significantly above), probably enough old people reach kinds numbers across entire population. hand, IFR older people countries probably horrific. don‚Äôt understand stuff works all, believe mathematical models show, depending multiple factors rate transmission, what‚Äôs called Critical Community Size, percentage available hosts, infection can‚Äôt maintain itself, precipitous drop off. Problem comes things touching. western country bag frozen chicken wings probably bag (plastic, paper, canvas, whatever) way home store touching food items. place bag shopping cart touching touching food items got. fridge freezer touching food items drawers. take grocery sack held bag chicken reuse kinds applications, touches even things.

Obviously viral load/amount plays this... much virus transmitted frozen chicken bag grocery sack, third item touches sack? much virus transmitted frozen chicken bag ice cream container next freezer? amounts enough infect somebody? know. basically schooling U.S. bad compared schooling ~~Germany~~ ***the world***

I lost track number times researched proven correct ""assumption"". can't even pay teachers decent wage. can't provide money teachers properly equip rooms based age group. much wrong, lie ""we greatest"". hanging nerve cells, might explain persistence well neurological issues people reported. know coronaviruses hide nerve cells open possibility.  thing is, never dispute. 1-3% CFR (case fatality rate, fraction people sick end dying) mind-boggling. epidemiologists seemed treating number absolute *worst case* scenario, think recall Fauci even saying much CFR likely decrease deploy broader testing measures.

The worst case projection 2 million dead. *error bars* projection ranged hundreds thousands dead--still substantially worse seasonal flu! numbers saying now? Hundreds thousands dead.

I think people know evaluate scientific claims. I'm sitting watching predictions come true, way refute evidence *don't believe people dying all*. NYC people freaking one neighborhood Brooklyn saw spike positivity....to 6.7%. staggering. Agreed. There's plenty blame go around others well. Personally, also like getting pretend ninja year long (easy already cold winters scarves warm face coverings!)

I bit lip balm/gloss addict though kind miss easy put on...but definitely making stash last lot longer! politicians same, career politicians are. really think Pelosi McConnell good people good herself? wanted good people sew division would've never gotten point infighting parties creation radical right left. flames stocked politicians calling adversaries evil name protecting paycheck 3x average working makes yearly 5x wage politicians claim ""livable"" fighting acting like gregarious. 

You tell think deserve that, tell modern digital age need spend time Washington ""fighting"" constituents districts states. joke know it, get little crumb there, little bit ""well side understood"" argument content vote party line again. Embarrassing. neighbor's son star football player local high school. said coach contacted multiple times basically begging let play team year. lost 3 cousins COVID. username checks check believe everything read kiddies.  want talk misinformation surrounding neck gaiters!

Duke study number masks total **ONE** neck gaiter. Duke declared **ONE** neck gaiter ([depicted worse wearing mask.

A sample size 1 neck gaiter made 1 type material cannot used scientific basis assert ""ALL NECK GAITERS BAD!"". Yet least half dozen articles week sub stating ""DUKE DECLARES NECK GAITERS BAD!""

More studies need done, sample sizer greater 1, many neck gaiters made many different types materials.

If they're bad they're bad, whatever, let's jump conclusions based 1 test sample size 1. expert means antibodies aspect immunity. might might still immune. 

We really can't know immunity lasts longer virus around. We're seeing occasional articles people ""catching months later"" usually amount another positive test (probably due harmless virus fragments still cleaned immune system), think we've seen anyone get sick twice yet... we're *probably* looking minimum 6-8 months immunity. know sure years gone people either started catching not. People think data faked. know fact it‚Äôs opposite direction people believe. surprise me. Yeah get this, stupid podcast show popped FB feed auto played, saying people cancer illnesses tracked covid throwing numbers. I'm sick lies stupidity. According mom dont deserve treated like humans either. Apparently want treated better, work harder extra hard work pay off.

But know this. rush hospital, demand immediate treatment, half-assed tail-between-the-legs ""apology"" saying hoax. thank God, rather *doctors,* saving lives. Countries aim sufficient producing food instead relying imports. break supply chain widespread natural disasters like make matters worse rely someone else basic essentials like food. agree using thinking USA use around world. Brazil India probably 300,000\~ considering many right many record. China probably recorded upwards 10 million cases something crazy like 500,000 deaths Yep, wear nice cotton cloth mask N95 without exhaust valve. r/coronavirus, everything gets exaggerated upwards here.

As estimates get accurate testing increases, mortality rate 1%

 

 

 can‚Äôt fire everyone saying family last night. psychology likely powerless little control areas lives spouse always telling boss etc anti mask thing gives sense control power. less testing ""less"" cases, deaths don¬¥t lie. thought said collapsed completely.

The U.S. already tests per capita countries.

The problem (a) tests low turnaround time, (b) everyone self-isolate swab result, (c) every positive person isolate two weeks (which means someone pay them, someone bring groceries them), (d) contacts Covid-positive people traced within day two tested immediately.

If test result takes two weeks now, stop testing tell everyone coming swab self-isolate two weeks. would free personnel help grocery delivery. Hopefully also improve relations Argentina UK. Mortality rate one way look people generally paying attention years could taken people's lives survive it. People ages. much know know scares me. Well, it'll fully tested soon.... Hey man, going win sub. place echo chamber doom. perform better cloth masks, poorly fitted surgical masks, neck gaiters, bandanas. falsify large amount alcohol research data. guess matter long get drink right?

Nnnn Whistleblowing hero, mean agree density factor also depends use it. Using country level doesn‚Äôt really say much. even city level. look Copenhagen low average income correlates cases lot density. actually 50-100 deaths though, point. Actual deaths per day hovering 20s weeks, numbers consistently inflated backlogged cases weeks months ago.

The government's daily figures tell us many deaths *reported* last 24 hour reporting period. tell us many people *actually died* 24 hours, deaths reported yet, may reported days, weeks months come.

Subtracting backlogged deaths daily reported deaths calling ""actual deaths"" misleading.

The law going change fit low IQ, start studying properly.

What gonna start broaching folks law work.... 

Start asking low IQ cases, low IQ jurors low IQ Judges fit low level attorney work! right course, suppose 10 day infectious period, first 3 days presymptomatic. knock 7 days symptomatic spread screening fever cough whatever, cut potential transmission events 70%. Sure 100%, still lot! 

It's like masks two meter spacing. Neither 100% solution. even they're 50%, they're still worth doing, every time reduce risk transmission, help reduce average number people current infected transmits virus to.

Short locking everyone away quarantine chamber, there's 100% solution here. Maybe elderly particularly high risk populations. rest us, objective ought stack percentages get risk transmission point epidemic dwindles away. source 10% number? Let's real here. jobs, can't done phone, turned crappy due covid. Try wearing mask construction 40¬∞C+. like water boarded, possible breathe especially exerting yourself. Also, signs posted say mask gets wet needs replacing..which definitely happening people wearing first place.

So hard interpret numbers, I'm sure there's huge decline number cases. that's true, expect deaths continue long time. actually went back look threads March April see still around. shockingly huge number accounts deleted since advocating ‚Äúthe cure can‚Äôt worse disease‚Äù Yeah imagine ‚Äúfortunate‚Äù enough lose job taking 4000+ month (in states) sitting home watching Netflix around horrible. hundreds thousands deaths missed areas hit first, many getting missed counted South America, Africa Russia.

To clear, China traced outbreak (known transmission) sushi bar.

At first, found virus surface salmon.

However, later found virus cutting board well.

Then found virus frozen shrimp packaging.

Therefore sequence must been:

\- frozen packaging shrimp opened cutting board 

\- cutting board cleaned, cleaned javex alcohol

\- salmon came contact virus cutting board

\- salmon cooked 75c 

Pathogen transmitted human host.

The food vector, vector packaging. agree deaths come health problems covid lead death overworked hospitals directly accounted covid deaths, helps show true extent pandemic. covid kill people, helped cause death makes excess deaths good measure true death till pandemic  actually Facebook post cousin handy explains logic here.

**NOTE: following absolute horse shit. horseshit demonstrative purposes begins picture nurse wearing Rn. Them: ""But, Cait, wear mask operating room?! people advocating people wear masks!""
Me: I'm glad asked! Let's break key points.
One, surgery setting wear masks couple reasons, none much anything preventing spread viruses. first prevent bacteria particles nose mouth entering patient's surgical cavity. anyone sick. carry pathogenic material airways, normally non-issue, patient compromised state given general anesthesia body sliced open, become susceptible opportunistic microbes carry. second purpose mask surgery prevent exposure provider patient's fluids tissue. Interesting note, many countries circulating nurse wear mask, hovering surgical site PPE.
Secondly, masks created equal people idea masks circumstances, masks provide little protection viruses. right mask worn incorrectly increases risk. masks typically worn operating room simply medical grade surgical masks, like one I'm wearing here, recommended use presence small particulate aerosolized pathogens play. They're great keeping teams spit patients incision communicate surgery prevent chunks tissue blood spatter inadvertent lunch menu, aside they're really little humid breath collectors. Instances one would N95 respirator would things like case TB positive patient. fit tested given specific mask type use cases. fit test consists putting giant plastic box head spraying aerosolized compound container wait determine mask fit good based whether taste/smell spray. big ordeal redone year facilities.
Last, 15+ years healthcare, witnessed improper use PPE quantify. seen seasoned medical professionals contaminate everything around matter seconds. Using equipment without proper knowledge training recipe disaster case, increased exposure. Unless thoroughly read literature understand approved uses, application removal process, appropriate discarding protocols, etc probably sit stop promoting inappropriate unsafe mask use.
So planning surgery shop groceries take walk park, mask really serving warm face harbor germs terrified right front airway. wearing sock underwear face rocking bandana like we're wild west, simply creating laundry yourself, absolutely nothing stop spread pathogens.
And say, I'm little disappointed see many ""educated"" medical professionals promoting unsafe, baseless practices seemingly forgetting foundational knowledgeüò¨
***None even touches negative health impacts caused extended mask use, chronic fear anxiety, allowing others make decisions feel informed empowered enough make yourself. I'll save another post.

The Fed right injecting hundreds billions corporate bond market, buying borderline junk bonds prevent Corporate Bond Backed Securities imploding ( remember mortgage backed securities? ). stock market zooming along instead main street USA. 

Imagine money gone PPP. May ask prophylactic is? Nah, Fauci legitimately thought average person would benefit mask. outset, thought would mostly spread surfaces. people wearing masks would likely fucking w unnecessarily, defeating purpose (you touch surface touch face).

Then later came countries success mask mandates seems it‚Äôs mostly contracted droplets via people‚Äôs face. although face covering won‚Äôt perfect seal, decreases transmission droplets greatly. That‚Äôs works.

Fauci realized adjusted accordingly. Sweden way better European countries. Bullshit.

- Sweden big utilization indoor gyms exercise

Theyre saying 70% bad NYC modern medical treatments make ultimate death toll much lower. too, huh? He's mad, he's disappointed. Although honestly pretty weird 5,000 people 46,000 tested positive died reasons, took 100,000 random people I'm guessing 3,000 would die overall year. See, that's gotcha comes in. gonna give benefit doubt, ruined letting skepticism rule reality. 

You made shitty false dichotomy. Try again. 

*Things objectively true, believe thing make baseless*

Nobody actually asserted *protests* lead Covid transmission, accurate.

However... *BLM protests literally cannot linked mass spreading way Lockdown protests be*

There's fucking *data* readily available look at, 3 days Memorial Day festivities led spreading 3 months BLM protesting.

The contact tracing data shows BLM protests extraordinarily minor vectors disease, compared literally every comparable situation States. 

*Because masks work enough people masked BLM protests, despite dwarfing Lockdown numbers, vastly safer en praxis*

Go ahead deny easily available datasets must try make point, point flopped like fat tired Alex Jones rant.

It's OnE sTuDy, *an entire body scientific work point* lol'd read comment cause knew going it. tried give out, wasted without second thought. 

Your assessment shows shallowly consuming information topic. research ""both sides"" *anything.*

Bottom comment tree seems predictable ever.  need demand people voting required also assist classes. volunteered minimum week kids schools. parent job provide written documents prove that. Otherwise get expose environment fine kids in. school board absolutely required school kids well day. Oh yeah. brother wedding friend bride said ""the waiting list 3 years long!"" 

I think I'll seeing person month. 

For research university real morons there. think good spreads now, enclosed indoor environments little airflow. Pretty much every single bit piece evidence pointed far largest route transmission. Actually getting people understand huge [hurdle go though. focused hygiene disinfectants forget actual ways virus spreads. kill, leaves lasting damage.

That even certain, MIGHT leave lasting damage cases yes, cases. way general rule. 


EDIT: Ah sure, forgot sub writing into... 
So.. ABSOLUTE DISASTER, worst disease possible ever, everyone die survive death crippled forever even longer. IFR least 120%, young people even higher! Thank you. making regret last five years life studying teacher. I‚Äôm student teaching spring. Wish could take back something else. whole thing fucked. No, see 2-3 weeks. That's see initial small infected people coming campus getting sick. takes week two symptoms show infection. need get 2-3 rounds people going pre-symptomatic/symptomatic phase enough people get infected statistical increase infections.

It's people keep looking outbreaks events seeing them. people infected large outbreak, initial infection round. giving people false sense security keep seeing events happen major outbreaks week two later...but takes time spread community. That‚Äôs woman? Sorry, Biden, don‚Äôt support Trump.

My comment replying following Also schools ridiculous. wait middle/ end August announce school conducted

It good thing schools wait middle/ end August make decisions Fall semester, rather making decision way back May, since data science constantly updated. 

Of course, schools may use latest science/data still end making bad decision. detract point, schools making decisions late good thing. Kitty Genovese would like word. E.

These new quarantine rules returning UK residents set early Saturday morning.

66% increase positive test cases France, 2,500 cases past 2 days. Cases increased Netherlands Malta.

UK residents countries heading quarantine 14 days return UK. Covid numbers are, death numbers? I'm pleased either... There‚Äôs around 300,000 idiotic countrymen celebrating bike rally Sturgis, ND spread way back home. got feeling it‚Äôs going brutal fall/winter here.

Edit: South Dakota, North... bad Fucking failures. I've eating restaurants often summer. Partied bars pretty much every weekend. go gym 3-4 days week. kids go school every weekday. 

And guess what, increase infected long time. numbers dropping since April. 

I wear mask. even mask. think seen single mask since whole virus started. 

But social distancing everywhere go. everyone else. become natural feels normal. know social distancing much effective masks. staying home feeling symptoms. Masks way list, really get many believe thing works. 

It's choice people make. people want focus masks closing restaurants, bars schools make maybe work, thats fine. look pretty stupid criticize others choose effective means close anything. Maybe caught previous SARS Sure, send letters inform school reopening. C'mon back bring masks. proof claims, though? ‚Äúmy sister‚Äôs brother‚Äôs second cousin removed said...‚Äù stuff, I‚Äôm talking multiple source-verified proof? you‚Äôre saying ‚Äúthese things happened‚Äù without actual evidence, tbh you‚Äôre part problem.

There‚Äôs reason people believe lies easily, it‚Äôs ‚Äúhey one time‚Äù stories.) Time burn fence say weight compensate effect. say:

‚ÄúProvisional death counts weighted account incomplete data‚Äù

And

 ‚Äúthe resulting weighted estimates may high jurisdictions low others.‚Äù PPE issue first (back March), things improved since then.

I personally never re-use PPE, please bear mind community nursing London (palliative care, IVs, wound care, meds, catheter care, drains etc). 

For community nursing, NHS said surgical masks, double-gloving, visors, plastic aprons sufficient C-19+ patients. exception would aerosol-generating procedures, i.e. trachy care resuscitation, FFP3 required. I'm weeks ahead BC. I'm really happy see Ontario mandating masks large amount places. BC still fence it. 

Combined people absolute cockwombles holding house parties, covid fatigue, well inconsistent mask use/adoption general population, second wave already begun.

As Arizona, oppressively hot. problem Malaysia countries people stay indoors time. Alright. see sources now. guess I'll go back heavy masks. Based what? I'm hard time believing headline. severe, lower death rate, maybe infectious? Definitely whiffs sensationalism. Wow worked COVID unit 2 months I've still never tested. even let get tested unless show symptoms (or donate blood, might do). That's crazy actually test hospital staff regularly, like smart totally understand hospital, they're cheap bastards! Hasnt saying like 3 month now?

- December article, said 1500 US coronavirus deaths Tuesday, August 11th? ?  Great... birthday... oh Hulk Hogans Birthday. Oh day Robin Williams killed himself, oh day buried/funeral Roddy Piper.

I hate birthday.  hate summer.  hate years years bs. Man feel old. going end legal nightmare superintendent principal? students still wearing masks? American seek asylum anywhere grounds government trying kill me? used love country, I‚Äôd leave heartbeat could. official death toll today surpassed entire population Corona, California. Nah - would require acknowledge COVID actually something take seriously. May odds ever favor. kids first day today. online classes live streamed. Seems half teachers even know wear masks. sure expect kids get right even adults can't.

Edited add - kids chose person learning, teachers wearing masks incorrectly big deal. It‚Äôs recently done hell job subtracting deaths/estimated total infections. estimate one knows many flu infections total. CFR case fatality rate, deaths / clinically diagnosed cases. always higher due fact illnesses clinically diagnosed.

COVID's CFR 3.5%, IFR around 1% based estimations. Surely nothing wrong government. /s That's funny. widely expect vaccine going 100% subsidized Americans. health insurance government, free everyone.

I imagine get point like flu vaccine. Signs everywhere. ""Get vaccinated here.""

I expect I'll get vaccine way get flu vaccine. I'll get email HR saying they're staff local hospital come (usually nurse), pick 15 minute time slot get vaccinated. I‚Äôm pretty sure community spread virus cannot accurately ‚Äòscaled up‚Äô test 100,000 people represent whole population, especially given sheer number conflicting unrepeatable results studies conducted globally. That's government, people, people, PEOPLE GODAMMIT! millionaire pays smaller percentage taxes pays actual dollars taxes low class citizen higher tax percentage.

So even Richer people contributing actual cash dollars. 

But yes politics is, always be, dance corruptness. Thank  I'm sorry hear that. really hope get sick, do, sue. That's unconscionable. :( government step help people lose businesses. Pay bills, payrolls, everything allowing open. Seems simple enough.

Is simple? definition ""everything""? know businesses make profits. government compute amount profit pay business? 

Besides, paying ""everything"" encourage businesses close. think good thing, wait local grocery store decides shut since government paying ""everything"".

Why think local grocery store remains open? make profit, local grocery store owner want open first place? Whether community buy food easily none store owner's business. Plenty deaths could prevented people respecting 

AND

Using HQC scale successful countries used read article? Close family members quaratined well. always amazing there's footage like corporations go, ""We need investigate further.""

Even without every week threshold me. Im severely depressed since March. life hold half year already hope anything. expect teachers comply, many states lose license quitting. really understand asymptomatic percentages, think way way bigger 40%. example Barcelona active case elderly care home, reported 26 cases (10 staff 16 elders) asymptomatic. looks like trend since summer started, thousands asymptomatic cases (for example, footballers said asymptomatic, teams several infected, sometimes even 20 players like Fuenlabrada 29 cases one fever. redlining Jim Crow laws longer exist nobody ever racist, too!

My theory? Widespread anti-intellectualism. information.

These doctors suggesting paradigm shift.

This way want open schools, could allow anyone school unless show clear test.  could testing millions days instead thousands.

Here long interview Dr. Michael Mina discussing test could behave much important video interview someone makes tests. bit dissapointing tests ready months. requires bit paradigm shift. ask doctor want less effective test surprisingly answer no.  look public health tool find people infective, rely gold standard RT-PCR confirm US CDC wasnt able deliver working Covid19 test months? virus bad here.

Yes even take low fatality eastimates populous studies still close 1% fatality rate, bad. Living hotel Coronavirus; check anytime like but.. never leave. probably worse people think virus hoax rest us go nearly often used to. Yep, contrary CDC telling ""the risk infection surfaces low""

Does fact Coronavirus found surfaces negate statement ""the risk infection surfaces low""? Thanks. great day. Hope back soon. OK, easy, can't it? making claim. back up. Oh yes, know crazy sounds. I'm considered one fortunate ones! Fun fact jobs never treated like humans Nice job liking back original statement, unequivocally false. bet didn‚Äôt even bother clicking links. Thanks armchair epidemiological analysis. realize early models, accounted weather, movement patterns etc Sweden suffering much much higher death rate (it seeming cap around 6,000, dramatically slowed, experts would attribute solely summer schools closed, weather nice Sweden April movement patterns cell phones show Swedes interacting others quite lot).

Have fun idiocracy suckas. think we've done okay. opening months retirement home spikes really bad currently Montreal basically everyone wearing mask. long maintain vigilance get complacent think we'll fine death rate taken grain salt. There‚Äôs many figures coming out, US reported staggering 42% deaths nursing homes. death rate going exponentially higher you‚Äôre frail old person. you‚Äôre 60 slim chance dying. ? certainly worked many countries. work, unionized, bumped salary position small paycheck increase (which nice, mean i'm complaining promoted) - I'm unable union. feel like slave labor now. wish never took promotion. get hazard pay anything like working around sick people every single day (we're health center). Meanwhile union employees spend minimal time office lot work home set up, directors making like 160k year stepped foot building since march. can't even use vacation time (i like month saved point) go away week everything collapses.

There's also little excuse office every day. almost 100% job home they'd let me, going office occasion need physically interact equipment troubleshooting/setup.

I'm fucking burnt out. job pretty cushy compared poor folks retail service labor feel bad complaining time job. feel like I'm going used tossed ASAP. can't even get information health insurance need requesting months now. 

Anyway, point employers seem find ways around unions even unionize. That‚Äôs much math! brain hurtsü§ï people got sick 50000 cases day. least 3% death rate.

We may see 2000+ death day soon. vitamin deficiency thing true mind blowing. Especially last part - ""Also, many fatalities health care workers UK first, since healthcare workers told supplement Vitamin any.""

I've worked retail 10+ years last 6 months worst, job wise, I've ever experienced. 
I'm lucky one regulars poached business, lol. Better pay, hazard pay, benefit options (even though prob need due partner good ones already use), better working hours, cool environment, solid respected local business.
I'm pumped start next week. odds suffering long term? Death toll ""due pandemic"" still accurate. 

Nobody dies single COViD virus says ""ha ha! GOT YOU!"" stabs person heart. People die secondary symptoms, pneumonia infections.

In war, count shot death tolls, also count death due disease indirect causes. guys arguing semantics. Call want long understand number represents. Theres way getting herd immunity 5% 10%, looks like social distancing works infectivity isnt easy assumed. time this? Deaths hitting almost 3,000 daily points late April/early May NY surrounding areas getting destroyed. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Quarter useless since takes long get results. ""Cackling women"" gave away. Sorry triggered you. let people wearing respirators store? question people work places like masks required. FU** ENFORCING customer wear masks company dont give crap you. It‚Äôs one thing tell someone ‚ÄúHey, masks required‚Äù go way enforce it, honestly you‚Äôre idiot situation. complying call police, remain calm. F*** putting life line, again, company gives little sh*t you. 

In words

Me: Okay sir. nice day. job notify you. want. 

Then, security present deal it. not, ohh well. bad. Because, AGAIN, putting life lane company would replace forget ever existed heartbeat. Unions live serve themselves, people they're supposed help. They're like Randall show Recess. No, never used vaccines already undergoing clinical trials. finish one. really. you‚Äôve every Publix?

You must work Publix much starting pay there? looked google said starting pays around $9 that‚Äôs great Exactly, don‚Äôt know people can‚Äôt grasp this. absence modern medical intervention, FR +5% isn‚Äôt inconceivable. Acceptance high marginal tax rates (to pay Depression/War debt). High union membership--with pro-labor policies exclusive one party.

As today U.S. benefits large market. relatively much larger much world unindustrialized, communist, significantly poorer US, due ravaged war. capacity crank-out ever refrigerators TVs many places export luxuries to, makes sense pay wages create broadest demand home.

There's also expectations create unsustainable climb healthcare educational costs. might manageable everyone refused medical treatments available 1967, accepted (as year) 10% people complete higher education./s tbf, stubborn morons willing adapt technology aside, instacart actually cheap. test order (like... put confirm checkout) like almost $10 delivery fee $50 order. kinda adds groceries week like people do.

I'm sticking click collect. saw fair people supermarket today pulling masks talk. think must retarded.  regularly find slack-jawed behind mask, nobody wiser. weirdly comfy.

CovID-19 obviously plot Spirit Halloween tank economy snatch empty retail space SCMP actually Hong Kong, okay want go route, here's US response next know virus, concern transmission symptoms develop low, reassuring,"" Dr. Jennifer Layden, epidemiologist Illinois Department Health, said Friday briefing. actually even worse, 47% died 28 days covid listed main cause death. govt removed 12% cases knows least half actually die covid.

change measurement means, removing deaths know covid caused dirty play gets. attitudes towards college importantly experts vastly different countries know schools actually get shut due local flu outbreaks?

I'm poster, sure did.

I bet we'd also fewer DUI related car accidents, fewer sexual assaults, lower rates STI inter transmission, fewer people silly police records disorderly conduct, fewer lost wallets, lower risks illnesses (arguably), alcohol-related illnesses deaths.

I opinions alcohol, I'm definitely opinion drinking probably better done sometimes home, rather going strange place specifically purpose getting drunk around drunk people, strangers. again, might look state current population entirely different opinion suggest... Literally public health campaign going adverse effect people, can‚Äôt stop trying improve public health people sensitive things necessary improve public health. agree general point. like say: likely die car crash way airport plane crash. one worries taxi journey.

Humans terrible understanding risk. be? know Coronaviruses work quite well, SARS 1 curable disease. Despite knowing everything it, still alien disease. Retroviruses HIV completely different. mean can't cause permanent/long term damage cases, every virus disease can, body gone. Yep...they probably understand negatively affect many areas life long term, particularly schools sporting events. 2 weeks. long grand scheme things FDA said biggest issues products young children accidentally ingesting toxin, **or adults adolescents drink substitute alcohol.**

We need know LEAKED lab studies natural bat viruses. They're indirectly affected government hospital policies.

Your 4th one year. 

Does describe well? Nuance subject matter difficult. 


On one hand, logic makes sense. other, many excess deaths untested likely Covid. government vested interest minimizing fallout failure. 

I personally think productive decision government see too. get home. virus mostly already droplet aerosol transmission. Americans become unnecessarily paranoid germs hands. Sorry don‚Äôt take word Chinese paper known controlled Government lol.

The Government lying first place. ""Like miracle!"" meerkat charge anything? You‚Äôre welcome! great day agree this. find funny colleges conferences using excuse player safety shut college football.

However, mean support banning things low risk.

As added note, encouraging people outoor things (in Northern US) least, might help people get system hunker winter, few-to-no social activities safe. understand value person education, importance education general, actually believe hope satire.

I‚Äôm fucking around, serious. think dropping testing wait time results atrocious. Getting test result week 10 days afterwards complete waste, need actionable information people modify behavior. time get result you‚Äôve already passed quarantine period. point getting tested isn‚Äôt change numbers screen, it‚Äôs take action stop spreading others. ""It is."" NY got hit early on, numbers great now. I‚Äôm kind fatigued whole worrying thing course is. Anyone rationally look state US knows we're best under-count death toll. Politicians focused suppressing numbers rather getting handle virus itself. 

Look Florida, fired lead statistician refusing alter numbers. Texas mislabeling deaths pneumonia months now. 

Take state whose numbers trust, look death rate infection rate, apply nation large. accurate sophisticated method, give perspective much information false. We're lied constantly. agree. 1. 30-40% referring dense urban areas i.e. Stockholm

2. Either way, article imply herd immunity *way* lower previously touted 60-80% need make policies inline new information Johnson also mentioned huge savings NHS people lose 2.5 kilos. Goddamn man must love high horse. must feel nice prove superiority internet strangers.

Going classroom alienates everyone learn well inside class room. that's clearly solution either. England reporting? 

That far article saying makes question reasoning skills.

Underreporting implies failed report positive confirmed cases. report alleging total number estimated cases confirmed testing.

Worth noting, UK tested 35% population per capita US. alleging UK ""underreporting"" test enough, feel US testing 74% many people UK did. State tax? Maybe see sell Florida?

I think clearly know real ""long term"" effect short term pandemic. news twisted left well right. I'll admit that. need able see read news logic filters. stop reading completely prove disprove sentence. 

For me, using head good is, takeaway virus spreads FAST LOT people ""get it"" VAST majority pretty much asymptomatic. Many literally even notice find later. people going LASTING effects effects first place. damaged immune system compromised lungs attacked... probably fine 6 months 6 years. Maybe can't know specifically say. 

But people went 10-day ""flu"" worse experience things actually know about. group overall majority ""positive cases"" US regardless testing accuracy still decent number people. friend uncle who've ridden 10-day flu version.

Out pot, whatever % (which cannot accurately know point, maybe ever) people getting pneumonia, lung/respiratory damage, compromised immune systems. That's virus actually gets far enough body defenses stop it. know this. also do, medical history, know conditions even particular coronavirus new. know things lasting even life-long effects person, depending. 

So sure, clickbait headlines designed Facebook targeted, yes. leave every third word, whatever, farm relevant highlights order make point. see is. Make call. know can. 

To football, information change view putting actual teams/coaches/staff risk? maybe important consider active college football NFL might encourage social gatherings know ""easy spread"" virus seems deadliest attribute. maybe think comes priorities; putting time money getting kids playing sports back running figured get kids school people back jobs? maybe think things still see stop football cash flow economy reasons. whole point nation trying figure out. right wrong way it. 

In words, reason sideswipe conversation get confirmation 50% number something argue completely useless cause. people go restaurants food.

THIS!!! Preach.


I love pissing urinal cakes. go strictly that. fact, even aware restaurants served food. phone ""local piss cake place; food - order it, yes you."" lessens chance getting infected still chance get infected.

Here crazy thing - kind place takes pro worker stance actually better business. motivated, happier, valued workers go beyond, makes customers happier. know, customer, would rather go place supports workers assiduously avoid not. Imagine naming troll hunter giddy responding people looking Attention thinking ‚Äú ‚Äú Troll . literally

OK 35% Americans degree know means majority don't? 

beyond attitudes towards college importantly experts vastly different countries narrow narrative death bad outcome COVID needs broadening include people becoming less healthy, **less capable, less productive** living pain.

American business attitudes toward pandemic need recognize this. really hate ""how (insert country here) beat coronavirus"". New Zealand saw ""victory"" blown.

How winning battle, sure, beat? country beat virus vaccine Alright, would count increase crime ""due pandemic"" since well, desperate people lost everything decided turn life crime? 

How indirect deaths due crimes? Say, someone uses counterfeit bill lockdowns caused lose job ensuing chaos, police officer murders him? also part ""death toll due pandemic""?

How suicides due lockdown depression? Also death due pandemic? 

I feel every single 2020 death could death toll due pandemic broaden term. Half population isn‚Äôt going disabled Covid-19, don‚Äôt ridiculous. think reasonable hypothesize many viral illnesses much way exhibit symptoms way infect certain people others. We're kind holding lens COVID19 noticing this, I'm sure held equal lens influenza common cold we'd see similarities infection symptomatic expression illnesses, too. sure Hill die on; still good cloth masks would think definitely better people wear nose mask all. I‚Äôm glad taking seriously I‚Äôd kinda pissed arrived said mask wasn‚Äôt specs (do free ones?). protect people.

There's thing absolute freedom want functional society. freedom ends people's lives safety begin.

Same reason government also forces tie seat highly restrictive manner driving (yeah, look deliberately word anything make sound horrible). one puts mask sunglasses instantly rejoices feeling anonymity, invisibility, something.

I struggle social anxiety I'm feeling way less anxious mask. Totally love going public without fear running people too! I've actually saved ton money longer going bars clubs. try still help restaurants ordering Uber Eats, way cheaper stock liquor cabinet home pour drinks invite small group friends over. possible also try sit backyard outdoors, risky nowadays go going karaoke bars stuff like  ""Love it"" **dumbified stupid fuck** Americans come rescue shit country.

US **indoctrination brainwashing** claims work? remember people told crazy making reddit banned me. new account. Go ahead, ban again. Fuck guess going herd immunity? tunnel coronavirus? Wrong. u/paltryanimal coming someone knows folks closely personally affected HIV, feel fair comparison whatsoever. fact bit naive. 

Corona come anywhere close numbers HIV/AIDS have; HIV/AIDS easily transmittable Corona, would fucked. Even thought HIV/AIDS known decades, still kills million year.

Oh, inform every potential partner life altering potentially life diminishing virus -- HOPEFULLY 90% reject you. 75% tell you. known dude AIDS.

I‚Äôm right wing. take say seriously: Maybe lack vitamin person exposed sun, therefore exposed virus going outside, building immunity low dosis virus everyday, instead infected harshly once. (I buy, least scientifically, immunity building up)

The coronaviruses infection+cross-immunity could major thing. Folks like actually part pipeline important respected times.

That can't seem reflect respond appropriately reflection deeper troubles. Yes, agree disagree. Orphan kids bad, dead teachers bad, dead parents/grandparents also bad. Seems like insurmountable obstacle. Definitely expert, amateur commentary.

And ""Do parents family also provide guidance?"" - many cases sad answer resounding, yes. area, informal study kids actually attended online classes March-May initial shutdown. Roughly 30% never logged single time according statistics gathered. Obviously small sample majority probably bottom end economically, found amazing. 13 new cases found contact tracing known community transmission case. one person infecting 13 couple days. Covid spreads fast, still fast. government oved quickly lock New Zealand's largest city. Let's hope contact tracers find existing cases soon. NZ star performer Western countries. far, they've shown possible competent government, unlike feckless disasters government US, UK, etc. use soap water.  Ah yes said scurry away animal knowing I‚Äôm PoC. You‚Äôre dogwhistle obvious doesn‚Äôt change anything. I‚Äôll keep eye üëçüèΩ Also phones filthy potentially contaminating surrounding environment using it.

My eye doctor also sent email detailing elaborate measures taking - limited access waiting room - magazines obviously - phones allowed used well plexiglass shields examiner extreme disinfecting measures taken.

My friend dermatologist told practice limited terms numbers patients seen point. Patients escorted cars immediately exam room doctors working staggered schedules physically see patients time.

I wonder practices handle ability able socially distance patients. Also doctors one must use valet parking services thought someone car touching surfaces appealing. much false negative narrow tolerance positive detection. might seem like difference without distinction, instrument science meaningful. someone engaged public health, we're really struggling educating people means. case, ""not positive"" really mean negative, means obviously positive abundance detectable antibodies.   
Antigen Antibody testing require whole bunch ""signal"" determine positive, certainty positives high. trying determine someone acquired immunity, that's good thing. dangers erroneously interpreting immunity great. application want certain positives. Negatives become less important.   


Same goes Antigen testing tool disease surveillance. Antigen testing higher not-positive error rate, near statistical certainty positives. also cheaper quicker, getting 200 people testing finding index cases spreaders done fairly quickly (12 hours got team 6 conducting testing). test positive still need counseled fact mean Negative, shedding virus quantity detected certainty.  
 
Conversely, test like common PRC amplification may \*slightly\* higher rate false positives, false negatives. population health tool, that's good thing degree, inspires higher degree caution onto likely cases, either directly indirectly reduces transmission, degree certainty negative also higher. Unfortunately, take long time develop results.  

In case, rate false readings high able characterize methods particularly *inaccurate,* they're different interpreted applied differently. Shit get see final report investigation already. must important. ‚ÄúGo outside. It‚Äôs nice today.‚Äù Oddly enough beaches Alabama packed year. Well 100-pound Immuno-suppressed mother works nurse lol, point taken Basically think must've arrived much earlier thought spread like wildfire reason.

Purely ancedotal conjecture, think spread around world way earlier too. I've got number relatives across south eastern US said worse flu lives back around Christmas New Years. late January parent friend son went mild cold coma less week organ shutdown lost toes. hindsight matches bad covid cases I've read about.

My question is, community spreading way back late December, hospitalizations deaths? still far enough exponential curve see ramp March? It‚Äôs de-population designer virus engineered take elderly, genetically weak, irresponsible regard long-term health. Sort bio-reset human race. Fortunately countries stepping plate USA abdicates traditional leadership position, China took lead Boeing crisis, EU Brussels effect going collection smaller countries showing shining example fight pandemic successfully. Exactly...and system engineered keep people debt permanently citizenry never ability help children leg up...none all...

That right, good society, lead longer middle class... /r/justfuckmyshitup ALWAYS give perfect score. Could imagine even little modest? ""I'd give 9 10. really good job, things could've gone better."" inconceivable. agree Trump point. bother testing gonna let people whatever want? Clearly American give fuck even tested positive contact tracing waste time there's like 80-100k cases every day.

Let steamroll year go back we're doing.

I'm waiting outside patiently virus pass go back US. Keep going, almost 70%. viruses behave comes immunity.

Some like HIV, HPV, HSV stay body never get cured.

Some, get, nearly perfect immunity life, like chicken pox.

Some coronaviruses like ones cause common cold, immunity doesn‚Äôt last long. coronaviruses like SARS MERS, re-infection extremely rare. could warn it‚Äôs deadlier everyone you‚Äôre dipshit, one‚Äôs gotten since created account express purpose, imagine I‚Äôd wasting time. Good news. Lots data supporting 20% herd immunity (with masks unlikely one place see second wave they've hit threshold. sure shit getting solved nothing letting everyone get fucked...

Example, comments article include, ""yeah testing much"". Apparently valid argument now, testing lot valid argument say ""yeah, testing lot"".... read somewhere cat got voting ballot

This complete lie pushed want stop mail voting US. private, non-government group used mailing list send voting registration papers, used cat's name. valid. Well that's contrary all! Low risk equal risk. facts true, transmission happen surfaces low source transmission. Yeah cntl+f search continuing claims. couple sentences devoted it, mostly embedded tweets. God hate twitter news basically posting tweets now... friend studied statistics said anecdotal evidence reliable. im sure people even know hell virus anymore, spreads. thing quite mystery mean it‚Äôs peace mind, you‚Äôre still breathing near lowers covid risk. That's fucking crazy US manage stay pack long flaws.

Easy. Absolutely challenges soil since Civil War. major disasters national scale, nothing. existed compartmentalized country countries, insular other, total complete vacuum. Even World Wars ""notion"" far away land US citizens.

As much evidenced country's infrastructure. rest world believes (or maybe believeD, LOL) US ""ultimate everything"". get visit stay, see it. crumbling roads. concrete bridges seen teaspoon spackle since 1935. power lines strung across roads highways little wooden toothpicks like Kowloon Walled City. doctor's offices operating ramshackle metal buildings still asbestos walls, quaint paper-based way navigate Federal systems Social Security Passport offices, homeless every corner, trash streets laid years decades.

Most rest world know America is. America know rest world is. Let fucking sit down! Every country world except US. chance hell I‚Äôm standing 8 hours near minimum wage sub used good. Americans arrived. thought calling China flu make deaths go away! source 50% rate?

 

Seriously asking, troll. lot people would lose jobs kids home. need wear mask whenever breathing near another human being. literally look mask valve is, could picture Immortan Joe. Indiana bones- raiders lust ark.  also worry potential hospital bills... ever seen price two+ week hospitalization ventilator? ? pointing fun factoids..

New Zealand went blunt approach, Taiwan saw coming prepared managed without that. Oh bad, also think didn‚Äôt want people take N95‚Äôs doctors nurses needed them, said much. remember messages panic buy masks needed health professionals sick. 

Of course unfortunate.

I replying someone said wanted seize masks resell them. doubt Fauci ever intentions sinister. Trump kushner, sure. scientists asked ppl buy masks. Kids get right though. go school charged truency. basically genocide. guess meant general. numbers look headed straight massive low income population. Thanks. really helpful. actually would glad teach English, would love learn Czech, too. Research it. Risk seems low Moderna's vaccine candidate contain part virus. Whaaa?? how??? lawyers **lined up** ready make $$$ COVID-related wrongful termination suits, kid yourself.

Companies would rather keep someone payroll lighter work hands. rich got $3trillion handouts last round. they're claiming money tree money? smell rat.  graph bullshit.  ""average"" line includes current pandemic... Notice line death counts... seriously... CDC suck it. Bunch morons. story Nashville last week so. Photos police asking people going bars like Bourbon St. put masks.


Apparently, 'Yes sir, officer"" response 99.99999% time bunch people money able go party, acting like they've never heard Covid-19. arrest homeless guy refusing wear mask.


Apparently anti-maskers balls tell employees private businesses masks. kemp yokel? Lol, makes sense blow fatality rate proportion regardless actually happens? Explain logic me, please. ü§£ 

The median age 160,000 you‚Äôre referring like 77 years old. words, average life expectancy America.

Surviving something 99.8% survival rate doesn‚Äôt make ‚Äúlucky,‚Äù it‚Äôs standard outcome. Based reasonably deduce ‚Äúit isn‚Äôt really bad.‚Äù weird virus.

Indeed is. People writing PhD dissertations academic disciplines thing decades. course numbers stable lower testing trump administration take numbers course. want economy open back don‚Äôt give shit virus. Must nice able get tested twice day know adequate protection insist using anyway, better dicknosers antimaskers.

That simply wrong. People wearing masks valves far better people wearing masks. for-profit model best way run health system. According CDC even worst scenario estimated average fatality ratio overall 0.008 . Nowhere near 1918 flu. need read carefully. 

Here's says:

""Provisional counts deaths known incomplete, degree completeness varies considerably jurisdiction time. Incomplete data recent weeks contribute observed counts threshold.""

Thus, recent weeks complete tally since takes death fully registered. 

Again, fine print CDC:

""*Data period incomplete lag time death occurred death certificate completed, submitted NCHS processed reporting purposes. delay range 1 week 8 weeks more, depending jurisdiction cause death.""

Again, see complete. Please, learn read carefully making false, unsubstantiated claims.  Gah suck 75-90% people US (pure guess)? know anything what's going India besides numbers see worldometers, pretty terrible. someone's really worried this, I'd suggest spending time outdoors, away people. Kids playing dirt supposed good immune system. I've spending lot time gardening still isolating people, I'm hoping fresh air exposure normal, everyday pathogens helping keep healthy (along sunshine physical activity). definitely good mental health, least.

It's true medical advice doctors following allergies days good expose kids foods environmental factors early likely develop allergy it. instance, giving babies peanut butter 4 6 months old recommended reduce likelihood they'll allergic. general, understanding want take care health, making effort live bubble beyond temporary restrictions we're take avoid spreading COVID. think wearing mask reducing contact people public places one year lives really harmful anybody's immune system. Live. Laugh. Vote. (My husband currently running problems suddenly getting registered KY currently living Canada). Don‚Äôt wait! Bush didn‚Äôt forget. read book started Pandemic Team. Trump dismantled didn‚Äôt read playbook. know got tested  F u c k 

We getting sick dying. need government officials working around clock help us survive pandemic. Malm√∂ Stockholm recently. think people Stockholm generally much worried covid, understandable white male perquisites caste, stressful days lashed innocents frustrated me. Give break.

If risking lives others hitting innocent people experiencing ""stressful"" day, seek professional help end jail like person (who also no-fly list). also 1/3 population lot less interstate traveling. yeah, save give new life long condition now. 6-8 months. Dang going vote people back in?! can't believe it. Wow people allow work keep working. analysis New York City only, **was** hardest hit city U.S. COVID **wasn't** particularly hard hit 1918 Flu (nor anyplace U.S.). 1918 Flu killed many 50 million worldwide, 2.8% entire world. equivalent today would 224 million. current toll COVID 750,000, 1/300th toll. Yeah know politicians, pulling strings get want....no matter cost :( wave 1 spanish flu also ""as bad"" people probably going get togethers, anti mask gatherings shit. that's probably started really bad ""wave 2"" initial outbreak.

i dont think seen last outbreaks.... Better achieved vaccine, though. Development making good progress. Dude another pandemic starts one ends know state emergency...right? mean want? even less time nothing? Holy shit Ok... so... send students home 2 days magically stops spread?! 

Oh gosh... didn‚Äôt think before? Guys - didn‚Äôt need lockdown 2 months... 2 days. Thats magic number virus disappear! 

Considering fact incubation period 2-14 day, see NOTHING wrong reasoning! 

(/s)

Ok point... Im betting close Wednesday next week take long weekend, start cycle again. 2120 - ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt covid u pussies, it‚Äôs ancient microbes underneath melting permafrost‚Äù Free covid? worse already infected capable spreading virus. healthy protect fine. top passing dementia test bonus points enough prove genius everyone???? people giving shit going way summer time. think so. Accuracy overrated. Dumb, inconsiderate, self-centered, oblivious,...
The list goes I‚Äôm also sick people don‚Äôt matter unless they‚Äôre kids. kids likely spreading unlikely get sick potentially giving teachers, parents, grandparents, knows else. regardless age people mentioned people lives valuable too! kids. measures taken still overrun hospitals, many dead normal. 'hyped' risk, might many more. would say given still middle it, would well hold overconfidence facts in. people still spread pretending they're part problem. Total deaths actually lowest rate whole year. Even pre-pandemic. within normal range USA would expect Uh... like Fauci lot you‚Äôre blatantly misrepresenting facts here. literally said earlier pandemic communicated wear masks due potential healthcare PPE shortages regrets it. 

Outright lying defend someone gives side ammunition. It‚Äôs good tactic. stock market well job market definitely not. ‚ÄúInterested‚Äù seem like reaction it‚Äôs one gets sacrificed bull god Line Go Up...  people get shot arrested that. think lot people virus fatigue going ""meh...whatever"" They've ignored centuries. America, that's probably best. Keep kind Virus live frozen food! Preach! Got it. first looked Apple data searched Sweden scaled slightly differently confused me. 40% tracks Apple data closely.  say triggers patients (who comply mask mandates they're psych patients). policy masks Governor mandated mask wearing. Guess keyword most. state deaths last 24 hours. anti freedumb measures save lives like pesky mask mandate, strict laws restaurants, lot us working remote. Brian kemp? pretty funny exchange. ""Basically people decide want truth ignore everything confirm it"" person talking proceeds lol ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt that!‚Äù people follow politics aware anything going on.

People literally wake couple months election, go back sleep 4 years. Tahiti closed travel? rather Americans are? (I'm sure, I'm seriously asking. assume whole world interested us visiting anymore) Neigh. feel like article titles framed make fauci look dumb. keep reading copy paste headlines say house cards service industry comes tumbling US economy grinds complete total halt 1.5 hrs day. want risking burn out... time come. Yeah, long last? like they've learned nothing. I'm bit cynical it. Seeing many people unable follow basic guidelines wear mask, I'm hopeful people follow quarantine properly. stop curing Covid maybe  haven‚Äôt lockdown last three months plus, enjoyed complete freedom pursue lives. one happy current situation learnt possible bring virus control return near normal way life. 

It surreal compare situation many countries, times felt like living alternate reality. strong determination community get back place.

A continuous focus growth healthy economy, need rebalance reflect build better life citizens develop sustainable approach. Successive governments used migration boost economic growth. one five (20% plus) resident New Zealanders born overseas, one highest percentages country world. think equivalent US rate around 14%. put immense strain infrastructure environment. 

Corona virus gives us chance decide important us put focus building healthy, fair resilient communities. Another joke opening. mask policy strict. mention kind hvac changes ensure room gets fresh air least 3x hour. 

I get think social distancing works within building, especially one recirculating air again. going like cruise ship school masks help environment saturated virus. get worried, please rest assured made sure benefits pay secure heading home. least going us ....ya know? serious? countries successful one locked didn‚Äôt. also spreads organics close one another. means us lol Positivity same. means testing less. good news Georgia really bad point basically parents report school. I‚Äôd parents don‚Äôt report don‚Äôt report truthfully, little done. hope you‚Äôre planning guests. It‚Äôs logical fallacy think hold wedding you‚Äôre already money. You‚Äôre money either way, hold full blown wedding you‚Äôre endangering friends family well money. I‚Äôd pare guest list like 10 people, immediate family maybe friends nice intimate ceremony plenty room distance. Maybe nice outdoor picnic something. always big party later safely.

Spanish flu horrible, worse W curve instead typical U curve. killed lots folks 20-40's. Families wiped now, Spanish flu wiped villages. agree, it‚Äôs hard hear behind plexiglass mask, it‚Äôs difficult read lips. clueless, *malicious.* imagine there's many rich people used paying 30k plus per kid schools already ton teachers could get jobs next year privately. even shity districts there's usually one rich people school Presumably they're working gene sequencing analyses cases they've discovered try find whether that's true.

They ultimately able determine likely.

I think belief keep lacking. Even strongly kept border occasional breaches. graphic really makes clear everyone taken threat seriously even couple weeks earlier, could avoided lot early deaths gotten good assessment situation spiraled control. [Hello, fellow ignore pile corpses compared Nordic nations they‚Äôre great! aside, forget parents resources monitor kids homeschooling :/. Especially younger kids. Ok. finally get saying. likely: shut way late caused massive community spread, especially densely populated cities northeast, eventually shut measures caused spread slow manageable enough slowly reopen keep new outbreaks local contained prevent increases things remained relatively flat several weeks. Masks help never said masks magic cure stopped Covid northeast. IMO, shut down, following recommendations CDC/medical experts. 

Sure, immunity may contributing factor, doesnt explain rural parts NY northeast also dropped remained flat whole time. Upstate NY cases nowhere near levels NYC doubts near enough cause herd immunity. honestly doubt enough cases even NYC develop herd immunity. 400k confirmed cases 8million residents. Antibody testing showed 20% population antibodies. Mayo clinic estimates 70% required herd immunity 

Now, I'm saying possibly explanation, seems likely reopening slowly safely community spread dropped manageable levels, several consecutive weeks weekly new cases dropping - exactly medical scientific community leaders recommended - reason things remained low here.

**My hysterical**? sticking out? thought zipped-up last pee break. No, large percentage deaths see complete, making unsubstantiated claim ""trending down"" evidence CDC suggests that. 

Again, CDC says time process deaths: 

""States report different rates.¬†Currently, 63% U.S. deaths reported within 10 days date death, significant variation states.

It takes extra time code COVID-19 deaths.¬†While 80% deaths electronically processed coded NCHS within minutes, deaths COVID-19 must coded person, takes average 7 days.""

The conclusions making based incomplete data. But, emphatically post numerous times everything trending evidence support claim since details CDC site state explicitly takes time fully register process deaths. Take polls people.  Replace. Replace. Replace. thing could come with, seems odd considering many medical workers *have* died elsewhere country. think ever know sure, nobody ever going study facility. maybe dumb chance. think we've pretty much established disgusting = idiotic, orange haired supporters. anti-mask blogs focus physics particle filtration requirement filter particle size virus, 0.1 micron, want claim mask can't filter 0.1 micron useless. that's true, virus mostly carried larger droplets stopped easily simple masks. 

Masks worked multiple disease outbreaks past. SARS 1 outbreak 2003 (another coronavirus viral cousin COVID-19) many studies interventions mask wearing. large systematic review --

Contact tracing can't solve issue point. require testing capacity far beyond AMC stands American Members Coronavirus? fast results? know people dc who‚Äôve waited whole quarantine periods three weeks results. wonder Covid behaves people really never get sick different virus. never flu.  Even husband child swine flu back 2008, catch it, anything special get it. husband son various flu's colds never get. never strep. get cold, maybe every 3 years lasts one day usually. generally never sick. wonder immune response virus either mild non existent.  Wonder, past virus response bearing body deal Covid?  900 health care workers dead far. Waiting Tokyo blow up. People familiar diseases like cholera typhoid. prepared take measures, believed diseases real, people cooperated.

Or maybe didn't. difficult make assumptions people thinking 100 years ago, obviously lot people died, uncooperation too. dislike preventable deaths. wish efforts put pandemic would put leading healthy lifestyles prevent many deaths well. Going back gym piece created conversation.. still don‚Äôt believe makes sense close places folks practice distancing wear masks. This^^^ pretty widely anticipated laws following 9/11 huge overreach would used American citizens, sadly Americans seemed fine moving towards police state meant gettin' terrorists. really understand downvoted. seems like reasonable accommodation. Kentucky :) besides, 5 million relatively close 0 compare 100,000,000,000,000,000 hoax, power grab. Educate yourself. guideline followed get trouble law. case law. Breaking law. ploy get anti mask people wear mask? Sweet, need billion dollars containment measures infrastructure every 500 people bingo, pandemic over! older get, likely nihilistic. mean, old people going them, especially kids?

now - fuck treat em like shit give ordered NOW

Wow...... would 33 year running moderate unseated New York rigged? Republicans house lost 2018? Omar?

The reality pretty clear fully rigged whole point. Wait normal daily basis?! like idiot convinced skin bullet proof hes shooting prove us never believed laws made protect us, saw would end used us, said so, lot, shouting rooftops. deserve government we've ended with, hope recover within lifetime. I'm waiting die, even hope dying revolution having. Thanks clarification. Honestly though, people throwing much hate toward now, can't imagine strike. Yeah errors would proportion other.

Even New York Venture County got wrong. would error similar directions used North America? common standard neither states countries. Yeah, criminals breed form criminal race known Australians. cases =/= transmission

Most countries start contact tracing symptomatic cases catch asymptomatic cases along chain. harder trace chains started asymptomatic cases, unless regularly mass-testing.

Transmission probably fact life foreseeable future, especially countries want green lanes. trick let go control. live Florida, government owns title stupid things said charge. Today learned mask mandate Fl, Marion Co Sherriff BANNED masks deputies duty visitors Sherriff Department. Mayor Sherriff holding hands Mayor VETOED emergency mask mandate county tried implement last week. I.can.not I'm sorry hear that. Speaking experience, restaurant jobs tough. worth, appreciate people make serve meal. hear ya. People spent years hiding complete uncertainty future. people crying can‚Äôt get nails done. feel bad parents? made selfish choice got caught it. Imagine trying defend people assault minors..... place dangerous place idiots believe conspiracy spread nonsense.

Stop it. retarded. would actively argue measure, would virus experts due low risk transmission, whatever makes feel superior.

Washing hands far efficient. would argue many young Americans unhealthier back seeing prevalence obesity obesity huge risk factor disease.

Another factor life expectancy much lower back technology extend life old age do. disease primarily kills elderly people would dead shit 1917. 

Not downplaying coronavirus bad different variables play. mean, world also multiple times less people 1918 now, US like 3x less people. Gotta make numbers look good time school kids ü§ó. mean, situations result corpse(s)...? Yea it‚Äôs crazy. Humanity actually regressed years nothing ashamed. state hygienist sign paperwork quick screening. Maybe ask school arrange day done. literally done minute two per kid parking lot. course, hygienist refer see anything looks super urgent meanwhile take extra good preventative care get checkups soon feel safely situation. 6000000 people get per day, surprise couple hundred die totally wholly unrelated causes also happen get tested Woah flu. Better PPE Classics Oxford like every fucking Tory. Wow, seem long ago *almost* 1 every 2,000. Thanks incompetent administration modern history think anything coming next year, afraid. DRINK DUMMIES! careful wish for. let guard down. difficult keep safe thing. know it‚Äôs months away uhh thanksgiving going see huge spike cases isn‚Äôt it? would love one explain herd immunity, see say. guess argument there's nothing left personal insults. I‚Äôm professional data scientist, I‚Äôm trying downplay COVID... it‚Äôs serious tragic. degree economics KINDA understand exponential growth. According latest numbers, likely lower REAL numbers, growth rate slowing. numbers going slower rate. look logarithmic charts, shows flattening. Again... still scary. growth rate slowing. Couple hospitals experience treating symptoms, don‚Äôt think hotspots (Texas/Florida) getting worse higher rate right now. Schools opening balance gains lowering growth rate won‚Äôt increase either. 

Every non-risk averse person catches COVID gets sick bed ridden (or die) one less person spreading it. risk averse people playing safe continue play safe. slowly, levers used spread diminishing. Again, schools balance inevitably close (hopefully).

But exponential growth narrative, although true, isn‚Äôt 2 months ago. 

All said... still super scary, still super serious, could go back time, 100 better options ones US did... 

But opinion, average, ICU bed situation won‚Äôt get worse now, albeit unexpected spikes there. good. hate going church. stop pretending non profits grifting members Honest question, testing places results couple hours (my local Walgreens area university)? tests produced distributed? agree long wait time useless, understand quick answer tests norm. Like, wrong, but...

I think still important enough pointing much worse areas contribute much. 

Maybe realizing big mac make sick takes anti-mask asshole wake realize shit serious. article downplay seriousness industry, highlights one particularly visible large part American population that, quite frankly, care inmates die en masse. secondary impact great Exodus places evictions two places not. Whether that's state level people leaving live older family members larger homes things like that. delay census think could big impact smaller states ultimately election people get moved registered time PhD Human Biology (specialized muscle biology) chiming in. I'm pretty sure extra muscle mass contribute higher BP cardiovascular strain. Sure, lot behavior associated increasing LBM, certainly does, e.g. overfeeding, steroids, abstaining cardio etc., think neither mechanism actual studies/scientific studies showing muscle mass specifically this. [Was 1504 2 days looks exactly like type person would governor Florida see HBO HULU theaters? haven‚Äôt seen person, 2 players JaVale McGee Matisse Thybulle Youtube channels it‚Äôs like there. feels like non-sequitur, evoking armed forces try misdirect actual point. Parents can't work take care kids. either need free parents allow attention kids send kids school. sacrificing children economic productivity.

me boss ""Just Geroge Washington crossed Delaware establish great nation need drink beer work.""

""ummm fired"" happening country. almost like covid19 give shit whether school not. ....so far cheap easy blood test inflammation may help determine COVID-19 patients benefit getting steroids.

In observational study people hospitalized COVID-19, high levels inflammation indicator called C-reactive protein blood reduced chance dying put ventilator treated steroids. steroid treatment doubled risk needing ventilator dying people low levels inflammation-indicating protein, researchers report July 22 Journal Hospital Medicine. Time school... got argument uber-eats driver this. saying wearing mask pick food leaves hands, switching gloves deliveries (though admitted latter would require supply knew mot people bother with), basically saying long wore mask handing food safe. think Youyang Gu put simply less Lower herd immunity threshold (HIT)* 

*Infections declining almost heavily-impacted states, despite clear policy interventions. Estimating HIT based current effective reproduction numbers results \~10-35% effective HIT. (Formula: HIT = 1-1/Rt)*

*From understanding, herd immunity threshold SARS-CoV-19 still 60-80% given R0 2.5-3. early reports ""wrong"". Rt much lower reopening (1-1.5) due changes behavior/policy, results lower effective HIT.*

In words, 20% immunity looks like hard threshold, business closures, masks, social distancing, changes. Stop 20% wont sufficient cases take again. people home putting risk (of coronavirus 'every day' things kills us. 

The home actually accidents result death occur would really interested see went measure home. 2018 nearly 4 times number people killed home road deaths UK. still agree lower number overall interesting morbid way see figures counting ones weren‚Äôt related Corona, re-evaluated Cause death Finally, good fucking news

We need people like right :) ‚ÄúHero‚Äù

I hate one. employees didn‚Äôt sign martyrs cause, wanted paycheck couldn‚Äôt find elsewhere. Pretending they‚Äôre readily signing sacrifice economy labeling ‚Äúheroes‚Äù pretty gross.

Used work Walmart, myself. T‚Äôwas awful best times. thanks.  They're fake. might interested Old article they've updating since Strictly speaking, line going straight pretty flat. worked supermarket like 2-3 years long pandemic, treated us like shit then, couldnt imagine now. poor guys.  Holilday season? combination air conditioning lot covid cases.. lack mitigation efforts.. That's all. Hey guys, heard Syria alot AC either! fired. transferred couple times school, wanting newer store better equipment, etc. Every store worked management always stick butt. way corporate, top-down decision making. would really like see excess mortality study region hard hit, months *after* got control... suspect missing quite deaths getting recorded MI/stroke/aneurysm.... Look Greenland. go, Greenland. It‚Äôs got electrolytes One would idiot ""not obsessively cleaning quarantining everything sight"". One would however idiot actively arguing measures. fatality rate continuing go down. sub mental !remindme two months ""reporting issue"". easy figure actual rate likely use basic formula compare much testing gone much positive rate increased. like middle school level math.

This simply matter someone clear political agenda saying numbers disprove theory ""problem"". Don‚Äôt worry, Jared case! Eh, easy everyone able without much effort, restaurants wouldn‚Äôt business even normal times. Let‚Äôs overestimate people‚Äôs ability cook. Ive cooking everyday past years would realistically take least tries even get close matching restaurant level quality burger

This failure culture government. too, mostly makes air fog glasses. know lol. Totally agree! Sadly, even thoroughly tested effective vaccine, still around cretinous anti-vaxxers. Deadliest since May. real, GOP would probably support [Children‚Äôs cases detected testing, England would set record number cases per million population. I'm really advocating anything.

But think lot mask resistance based idea really know whether work not. turns work work well, could buy well-designed, scientifically-proven masks convenience store reasonable price, change whole equation? Isn‚Äôt report doing? Looking deaths threshold. assumed deaths mean deaths causes. didn‚Äôt see differentiated medical vs trauma etc. wrong, please point right way. 

My whole point total effect much, much larger seeing reported. Good thinking, awesome. :) redhead got sent home due possible exposure colleague didn‚Äôt realize taste smell symptom, I‚Äôm *really* hoping makes difference. even great pro-business. Business massively disrupted. GDP 32% last available data, probably worse currently. done right way first time businesses would much better off.

It's short-sightedness gross incompetence, negligence malice, grifting. surprise Trump took direction Putin handling COVID US, purposes weakening US - obvious logic Trump wants pull Germany, S. Korea, Japan, NATO, etc. Human coronaviruses much less common. 10-15% colds coronaviruses. Many people therefore coronavirus past 5 years.

Despite this, portion population infected human coronavirus recently enough protective T-cells. people individuals talking about.

If 50% people automatically protected, would make sense. looks like little 20% population hotspots antibodies. may people infected. there's 50% T-cells coronavirus, adding 70% - herd immunity.

We actually know many people catching it. still lot learn many people protected due T-cells coronaviruses, also COVID-19 infection bring immunity T-cells instead antibodies.

I'm UK, seeing serious outbreaks pop places serious outbreak before. 

The general consensus moving towards idea countries battled pandemic early (like ones Europe) may closer herd immunity originally thought. true places like New York. here. Used work supermarket UK confirm here, Middle aged people tended worst. male female.

The one younger-ish person ever got grief local twat spoiling fight usual. look math, using US data example front me:

* ~150000 reported covid deaths

* ~200000 excess deaths period reviewing comparing historical cause mortality

* So, ~30% potential undercount

* Let's assume 10% counted covid deaths misreported, covid deaths decrease ~135000

* But, still ~200000 excess deaths cause mortality, undercounting error becomes worse

The way we'll truly know deaths look back end reviewed excess cause mortality. standard practice looking effects disease, etc. potential misattributed deaths affect cause mortality numbers total aggregated time. Guess waiting b results... require patient zero, course. One version happens specific human agency, is, simply put, natural process. first requires something extra explain it, detail comment, latter not. makes latter null hypothesis. 

Publishing sequence previously published thing happens. would also demonstrate record found, records destroyed. need conversation null hypothesis provide evidence one, that's works. 

Virus sample escaping needs explain found, stored, transported, hidden, released, covered up. Virus manufacture requires making virus using unknown method, stored, transported, hidden, released, covered up. None null hypotheses. 

It's true biolab, like biolabs occasional leak. also gain function experiments type virus. fact people think therefore evidence manufacturing accidental release seems like lunacy. we...falling love? Misdiagnosis common normal circumstances. feel bad I've started tipping groceries fast food.

But I'm Mr. Moneybags, much give, I'm one person. cannot rely charity times like these, far know absolutely none stimulus packages intentions helping workers (aside lump sum us poor chumps get) There‚Äôs fairly public drive UK creating masks transparent section mouth. It‚Äôs pushed deaf people charities societies working behalf deaf people. also impacts sign language.

A quick search dead mask bring thing‚Äôs up. 
Here‚Äôs BBC May It‚Äôs almost like didn‚Äôt actually click link read article... Try voting helping get vote instead. depends, everyone wearing masks compliant way store? so, I‚Äôd take store mask less people Sitting close other.  pick extremely basic definition scientifically defined word. 

Im flattered choose definitions words. Oxford editors chose particular definition. Again, problem this: instead admitting wrong changing opinion try change actual definition fit incorrect argument. approach never work. lesson futility. Ron sending kids daycare gernophobe - like everything Trump - anything says simply convenient excuse time. gernophobe would act way Trump acts pandemic / gernophobe would go raw pornstar.  increase 3500%. initial plan one hospital main island (there two hospitals another island) developed ventilators capacity less 10 patients. system built it. actually pretty unlucky size territory. country willing sacrifice children's lives lunatics wield guns, doubt children dying COVID make difference... Hang on, who‚Äôs terrorist analogy. Here's piece missing. Lots (and mean lots) nursing home patients take vitamin daily. sparing severity COVID-19 all. They're one hardest hit populations. idea need test see supplementation helps improve outcomes cute scientifically, physicians already know changing outcomes. correlation severity related comorbidities. American thing think taking vitamin going rescue COVID-19. Every day every way he‚Äôs getting stupider stupider. wanted discuss degree population immunity may contributing curbing Florida, Arizona Texas, recent surges resulted substantial epidemics 

Interesting discussion Pneumonia still needs cause. Lungs inflame themselves. year everyone adhered strict quarantine. gatherings prolonging spread virus. want add one point: admit China fact issue warning asymptomatic spread 25/01/2020, yet posts ago denigrating SCMP reporting news implying lying benefit China, why? think SCMP apology. testing falling. cases could anywhere. Mine telling symptomatic staff get covid test Republicans want ‚Äòfix‚Äô numbers. person said family get togethers 10 percent 100 medical field nothing ever sure body kinda wack isn‚Äôt body-language large part communication deaf community?

Lips one part that.
Not lip-reading minor thing.
I‚Äôd really love deaf person came gave us perspective this. go ahead read it. Can‚Äôt second wave never leave first one. really easy, maintain caloric deficit. 
Go walks, eat healthy portions. Don‚Äôt eat fast food time. work food, amount corners cut due understaffed would make want eat fast food.  One health security issue, foreign military security issue short writing; idea tries compare two variables different scary morally questionable. Sadly, nothing humans do, muct gracefully accept sacrifices I'm entirely sure unlike 100 years ago live age technology would able store actual information whole event. Coronavirus pandemic likely gonna documented pandemic human history due fact happened timeline. also keep mind 1918 flu happened ww1 many governments around world controlling media hiding flu exist. time tons tons coverage coronavirus internet really doubt people forget easily shiet nearly affected everyone due lockdowns economic depression. Get vaccine risk life getting it. choice. *We use cookies umprove experience site*

With attention detail like that, medicalxpress gotta reliable news source, right? 20% positive rate end totals tests pooled testing. *insert sound clip kids saying ""YYAAAAAAAYYYY!!!""* idea included TV series movies, way 9/11 woven in, turns stomach. can‚Äôt cats vote? force get rabies shots, representation. cat hates forced shots violently rebels every time ! 2020 flu season - nonexistent. social distancing obliterated flu year.

Please correct I'm wrong, really would like true, flu season like December-January? really start social distancing mid February, I'm sure see much connection. trying say there's multiple strains covid? absolutely is. Several genomic variations covid sequenced know varying mortality rates. What's scary *are* experiencing 'warm weather hurts covid' effect, noticing underlying trend bad.

This terrifying possibility. so, we'll looking deaths millions.  people know personally (I'm aware people social media views) oppose socialized healthcare much helping others simply trust government oversee it. Which... fair, US government turns everything clusterfuck. 

Personally, think American healthcare *already* FUBAR clusterfuck needs ripped rebuilt ground up, definitely understand sentiment. yes wifes mental health suffering would able confide person mother. findings, plural noun

2.a conclusion reached result inquiry, investigation, trial.

-

Findings proving, one said (including headline) study proves anything, finds it. experience certain extent back soldier. poor wanted go college, wasn‚Äôt joining ‚Äúserve country‚Äù believed wars (and still are) fighting.

It‚Äôs poor fight America‚Äôs wars, whether it‚Äôs Taliban coronavirus. total imports agricultural products Brazil totaled $3.3 billion 2018. Leading categories include: coffee, unroasted ($934 million), fruit &amp; vegetable juices ($501 million), red meats, prep/pres ($281 million), tobacco ($211 million), essential oils ($145 let them. 

When said look Sweden nothing can't we

Rather pointing Sweden plenty social distancing place, far business usual. said look horrible Sweden doing. 

Now Sweden getting population adjusted social distancing cases falling get say oh look Sweden. See need anything. Oh really? Never would've guessed that... course forget it. survived Spanish flu alive, even fewer people like listen great grandpa tell stories 93rd time.

In similar vein, reason fascism rising America WW2 vets dying off.

Not enough study history, doomed repeat it.  confirm Midwest people ignoring coronavirus. travel Kansas work, literally every town that‚Äôs Wichita Lawrence like 5-10% mask participation. please article: 32-year-old man ‚Äì away 70 minutes visited busy inner-city supermarket ‚Äì tested positive Covid-19. since charged new public health legislation. faces large fine six months prison.

You realize exponential potential virus right? what's opinion anyone market gets sick hospitalized worse? think liable? cover medical costs, loss wages, collateral damage? do. 

Source Africa? find hard believe anyone would running away medical facility people get fed middle famine. Articles New York Times today say 200,000 already compare ‚Äúnormal‚Äù deaths per year are. tossing question friends...

How many daily deaths would needed local county nearly everyone start taking seriously?

A dozen per day? hundred? Thousand?!

The general opinion seems refrigerator trucks everywhere bodies piling big time (aka thousands). Pop Pop!  say numbers fake. 

Cases high? Fake
Deaths rising? Fake
Children infected? Fake
Cases dropping due decreased testing? Fake course temporarily doctors nurses work non-essential/purely cosmetic procedures stop working. non-essential/purely cosmetic procedures.

its worse. even essential get done. schedule anything operating theater expecting hospital visits subsequently expect ward covid patients? hospital swamped those. 

And USA model means treatments pay. want chemo every second week associated extra risks prefer wait? medical research publications... speculative? Agreed. Also already stated evidence asymptomatic transmission. unlikely large number people waking around symptoms.. I'm sure some.

I say quarantine high risk like chicken pox party everyone else. would rather get immunities old fashioned way. Please name places hit threshold double check later Thanks sharing, listen this.


Honestly, surprised. realized youtube would spam recommendations certain MSM videos/channels watching few. pick interests fall echo chamber careful, regardless political leaning topic. try stick entertainment youtube. actually hard quarantine past six months wouldn‚Äôt worry people hunker winter outbreak would controlled. hospital screenings multiple ways run covid sample- house, house quickly, send out. symptomatic (or asymptomatic exposure) hospital workers TAT \~24hrs less processing hospital....without fail get calls ER night staff member symptomatic wants know rapid method so...they can....go work tomorrow??? tell every time run tomorrow going work symptoms anyway really matter? exact opposite article, workers themselves, admin, insisting go back work. Oh really? Like amount money given hospitals covid death vs another reason? Pillar virtue. 

And let‚Äôs completely ignore putting Covid patients elderly homes literally burn vulnerable. ‚Äúearly mistake‚Äù. I‚Äôm avoiding anything. warned COVID asymptomatic spread January 25th. knew 3 weeks earlier. 

Why would mention it, immediately, upon discovering it? 

Because intent conceal hide anything might make country look bad.

You keep repeating thing doesn‚Äôt change fact China lied omission.

The warning came China 3 weeks lying. That‚Äôs good enough. fact - it‚Äôs very, bad. One thing people understand following guidelines trying safe possible makes job lot harder. simply cannot multitask way used to. trying best, sorry takes extra 5 minutes get sweet tea would mean like 0.24% would die though. mobile hotspot ""5G TEST 200%"" months now. ""Unlike terrorists sometimes live rocky, hot forbidding environments, face adversity. Social distancing hard. Let's go school see happens, fuck it."" spirit mask. available right now? so, direct might get one? Totally different situations way comparable other. 50% stat completely made up. Nice. dont take census corona patients determine 50% might long term complications. 2.5 million large sample size anyway because, statistical analysis, samples done without replacement would affect independence results. Anyway, stop bullshit stats. You‚Äôre spreading misinformation. suggest editing original comment. Here's paper: [Comparison Estimated Excess Deaths New York City COVID-19 1918 Influenza bottom incident rate ratio all-cause mortality peak 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic early 2020 COVID-19 outbreak 0.70 (95% CI, 0.69-0.72). is. overdose unusual unless you‚Äôre taking mega doses long term.

Are US? Can‚Äôt see doc run level test? Labcorp, Quest testing facilities run test you, it‚Äôs $70-80 without insurance. order tests portal like www.healthtestingcenters.com

If want add screenings D, $99 get Basic Health Check bundle Quest diagnostics - metabolic panel, urinalysis, CBC, Lipid Panel, A1C diabetes screening. question random samples like many countries doing

People questioned answer obvious:

Other countries universal healthcare coverage better afford conduct random samples/ testing population.

We can't who's gonna pay it? Insurance companies gonna pay client get randomly tested even though acute need testing? individuals going tasked paying cost randomly tested potentially quarantined without pay two weeks test positive? resource strapped governments states cities going take cost tests? 

The reason hear people questioning things often might like current system, current situation, answers pitifully obvious Arguing number positive tests really silly honestly. 

Ok! think honestly silly like, however, unless another source semi-accurate data work with, that's data take seriously even look cash money us right point, people come sub confirmation need lock economy close schools. forgot include group comment, group happens majority sub. 

Those people witnessed every major nation earth took situation seriously locked economy closed schools get outbreaks side enjoying life, many US refuse even put fucking mask wonder shit still shut even outbreaks far controlled sense word. right, majority sub, many watching since virus still China seen methods work, methods don't. Etsy really fun masks. lots styles choose it‚Äôs fun collect wear new one every outfit. least rotate several masks Again, fucking loser, think I‚Äôm attorney think I‚Äôm attorney back Chinese dry cleaner? üòÇüòÇüòÇ 


And know work. know much money make...why would random thoughts think work based couple interactions bother me?!? think you‚Äôre projecting, bro. good life. Right, article trying make things sound worse saying ""deadliest day summer"" really deadly days. town self-quarantined really early? remember article said even mayor's mother stuck Fairbanks hotel come back couple weeks.

EDIT: Found it, one Arctic Village, Alaska. Guess they're OK, heard heard interesting take individuals who's genetics traced tropical/warmer climates less resistant diseases primarily occur colder climates (cold, flu, covid, etc). point discussion revolving around N95s vent. one use vent middle mask, surgical mask top would probably prevent droplets coming dangerous way. I've seen non-N95s vents one side. feel like maybe effective surgical mask top vent much closer loose fitting sides surgical mask. I‚Äôve seen people say car accidents classified covid. proof. Epithelial cells different endothelial cells red blood cells / leukocytes. kind broad generalization / assuming what‚Äôs going dangerous. it‚Äôs largely reason anti science movement. people spout shit makes sense fact, despite formal knowledge subject. 

Sincerely, real doctor tired correcting people‚Äôs inaccuracies COVID. Mask go pharmacy get vaccine side room masked pharmacist. would go doctors office get it. respirator, goggles face shield worn. work non emergency medical dispatch (think dialysis/chemo/physical therapy) transportation.  time get asked it‚Äôs safe, usually go ‚Äúour drivers instructed sanitize vans clients, unless it‚Äôs life death, generally safer avoid clinics.‚Äù Well sub like There's plent evidence. NYC / Italy / Stockholm rise cases despite opening many parts economy. Data scientists pointing reason surges eventually recede.  scale? Surely seems ultraconservatives worldwide obsessed opportunity play butthole. thought sold China thought ironic? wasn't.

Respect given people based treat people around them, profession have. Oh god. First Americans, UK too? Seems like China got ahead everyone publish numbers Nope. stopped trimming nose hairs now. practically braid things. university work students come back week. masks signs health checkpoints everywhere, give 2, maybe 3 weeks shut again. amount preventative measures stop spreading classes, dorms, eventual parties kids host. again, many cases Florida Texas like Canada way less? Congrats identifying people scum. Welcome life society. Go cry want, people suck. either adapt suffer sure fuck won‚Äôt. literally worst year life. Thanks. wondered accuracy well. I've tested feels like brain-swab takes results (12 days first time, 4 days second) friend easy diy nasal swab inch in, results couple hours. now. first mostly Dem states like cases, deaths also undercounted.

a lot people seem miss point. no, can't use total infections antibody survey count fatalities confirmed cases determine CFR. gap confirmed case fatalities total fatalities likely smaller gap confirmed cases total cases, def exist.

also, high variability among antibody surveys cause skepticism survey numbers. Yeah agree, people would want forever. Unfortunately, sub represents pretty loud minority people would (and currently) defend permanent mask mandate define ""poor ventilation""? think fighting looking wrong argument. argument oversight (or lack of). Take gender bias bullshit somewhere else.  Tremendous. Trump right. flu /s Oh know! adding two cents thoughts, thanks sharing. Stay safe good luck. likely, doctors know treatment, fatality rate somewhere around 0.3% so, long hospitals overrun. Oh getting started think mobbing healthcare workers petulant *listen them* acceptable? people saving lives sacrificing own? No. reason members community care. selfish believe rules apply them. want sacrifice small freedoms short period everyone enjoy freedom. New Zealand locked roughly month. virus running rampant country.

Do better America. flu lmao 24% last heard. Horrifying. I‚Äôm waitress. table sit section night. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre New Jersey, haven‚Äôt gone eat 6 months! need this!!‚Äù

They got: One iced tea, one lemonade, one cheeseburger, salad. 

And we‚Äôre cheap either! bill $40 something? $50? tip. haven‚Äôt gone eat 6 months order things easily make home (for cheaper!)? Come on. went grocery store Tuesday saw candy corn Octoberfest. clue close.

and record, went home candy corn Octoberfest. need Nuremberg scale trials  US death numbers pretty dubious themselves, fair point, adding back would take 79 days balance. currently nothing change US course place, still sees pretty likely. actually use term ‚Äúgobshite‚Äù.

Still waiting witty banter. putting 2 cents like everyone else, isn‚Äôt makes US great?

People saying nonsense hear talk makes US great. opinions important say completely failing tests little disingenuous 

It certainly disingenuous say that. one made argument. saying less testing previously were. Also, people antibodies. Yea fuck China. get foggy, wearing mask wrong. KN95 doesnt fog glasses mostly fitting perfecting head cotton mask fogs first unless pull put glasses makes fit better face They've done nothing probably Wait, context this? getting certain stupidity merely (\*sigh\* merely) evil intent, says, quite purpose. far aware contagious 4 days catching it. got point friend got tested, likely exposed time ago, passed peak contagiousness met you. think missed haircuts negative effects shutdowns? second - please explain. Also, located dont mind asking? Curious infection rate area theres indication yet think working protect. stop testing dead Covid-19. Problem solved. plague Inc strat lmao

Spread bunch people symptoms start making bunch symptoms crazy person worries surveillance state: *lol, seriously think still go outside?* like shorting family members! Genius! sub prefers apocalyptic group-think

I come sub manage panic attacks.

And ""manage"" panic attacks, mean cause intentionally, often humanly possible. Last one alive valedictorian! :/ could change, yes, seems like less socially disruptive approaches result fewer excess deaths long term. Sweden example looking 1 death day long time now, total excess deaths actually negative. seems sign resurgence. Without resurgence seems highly unlikely go back excess deaths since able remain measures, unlike countries lower immunity levels. **doesn‚Äôt** way.

It mandated alooong time ago.This fall winter fucking shitshow thanks antimaskers trumpeteers.

I‚Äôm seriously losing hope time soon. welcome back Captain Planet, world needs now. preaching choir that. mean, person mentioned Jake Lloyd's experience, Hayden Christianson went hell too, years ago people started embrace performance prequels (although still like AOTC script made sound like Buffalo Bill Silence Lambs, blame shitty script directing *way* Hayden. Actually even blame him). matter opinion. someone like movie character movie give anyone free reign ruin actor's actress's life. Prequel, sequel, otherwise. last years made embarrassed like Star Wars it. got me! hear well, honestly good anti body test?

That before. good antibody tests now, unless early infection (potentially) several months NYC yes. Austin yes. Houston yes. Everywhere Texas? Wildfire. Indoor dining still thing. Church still thing. Human animal, point stands everybody enountered coronaviruses past 5 years. actually read one, copied Google Scholar looked relevant.

As points, making assumptions. 

You know quickly virus would spread completely vulnerable population without T-Cell immunity. Therefore, cannot say would spread faster populations without T-cell immunity. Half population may automatic protection, may extremely virulent without that. 

And no, mean T-cells causing it. Like said before, pieces jigsaw puzzle. phenomenon, able come reason may occurring (due T-cells). far, theory holds up, never said certainty sure proof looking for. I'm saying best have, evidence far line we'd expect. studies across back up, however bookmarked. suggested Google Scholar.

Also, see here: mean, know poverty full industries shutting kill people right? 

Hell, even care owners places (most actual people, faceless corporations), government way interested sustaining number people work restaurant industry unemployment long. That's massive amount people money pocket. Tons people industry undocumented and/or work table too, people really fucked since qualify government assistance find harder make living side hustles. probably making reference recent German study showing 70 odd percent people covid, including asymptomatic irreparable cardiac damage. 
So completely baseless? definitely worrying idea anyhow. know going now. question hand suggestion 1918 pandemic ended flu mutated become less lethal, vs suggestion population instead became immune original, mostly unmutated, virus exposure. reference, Ontario consistently testing less 0.4% positivity rate. yes, that's really high. What, turning EBCDIC option make sure characters ferjangled old IBM system ? Researchers USP-Ribeir√£o Preto Medical School reported rare case coronavirus reinfection relapse symptoms Covid-19.



There one similar report scientific literature, took place Boston (USA). Brazilian case 24-year-old nursing technician, tested positive new coronavirus twice interval 50 days.



Nursing technician also recurrence symptoms; second case world literature. Rivaldo Gomes/Folhapress, NAS RUAS -¬†Folhapress



Researchers around world investigating possibility reinfection Sars-Cov-2 since beginning pandemic. several reports persistent viral RNA detection RT-PCR swab test (sterile swab) nasopharynx oropharynx, without recurrence symptoms.



In addition compatible typical Covid-19 symptons, researchers gathered laboratory evidence (positive virological serological results) epidemiological evidence (contact confirmed cases occasions) reported case. data set confirmed case disease.



They claim possibility one virological serological tests may false positive result exists. Still, remote, given combination evidence.



""In conclusion, present report confirms that, although extremely rare, reinfection Sars-Cov-2 illness Covid-19 one occasion possible events"", conclude.
For them, finding clinical epidemiological implications need carefully analyzed health authorities. 1 80 Americans die every year. five times day you‚Äôre whole house I‚Äôm really not, fixation part. get one OpenWRT something similar, allow broadcast multiple SSIDs. Performance would probably fall exponential, cares. 
Get one micro usb power (commonly 'travel routers'), Powerbank.

Edit: additionaly, get script router changes SSIDs automatically (with crontab/crony). OpenWRT everything (relatively) easy changed via command line.

Osama Gym Laden  really hate ""startling surge"" cases children, fucking obvious would happen reasons.

1. Children tested whatsoever early pandemic, missing likely millions cases children teens back then. Respiratory viruses spread schools super easily, ridiculous people act like Covid probably start running wild schools locked down.

2. summer, children stay home time, parents work. again, see adults overrepresented.

3. spike now, return school sports school again, anyone ever gone in-person classes U.S. educational system knows COVID going run rampant basically disease runs rampant.

The death count terrible case count far high, ""startled"" means author totally oblivious reality schools  Thanks ~~Obama~~ Lockdowns! ignorant?

Herd immunity everyone meant survive nature. Better shooting guess.  Shit! Sixty percent locals want it. jack-asses Harley parts internet saying going whether canceled not. Meaning town could cancel bikers show anyway cancel try set guidelines. Damn, guess making testers probably good idea? first major pandemic warranted measures. 

Just measures taken response past pandemics (where possible/ plausible time) make crisis worse Smallpox, Spanish Flu, TB. 

&amp;#x200B;

The reason measures taken H1N1 Swine Flu, though contagious, deadly seasonal flu's. contrast, reason measures adapted widespread manner 2003 SARS, though far deadlier Covid H1N1, good transmission person person able track cases lock downs isolated couple locations instead region/ nationwide.

&amp;#x200B;

Covid deadlier pandemic flu we've seen last hundred years, amazingly adapted far contagious influenza strains we've seen time. 

It's incubation period amount people may exhibit symptoms still contagious unique situation. One asymptomatic person densely packed area infect dozens others turn infect another dozen on, two three weeks time, see hundreds thousands people flooding overwhelming local medical infrastructure, enacting even strictest measures take weeks showing effect.  Unless really long conversation, probably pretty low concern scale. Still weird/dumb thing do. Yeah remember type people resistant reason. Claiming ""most cases asymptomatic"" sucks.. Hopefully things keep improving career gets back track soon! family also pretty good shape. unexpected changes plans, everyone still safe, healthy, serious financial trouble. 

All all, I'm super lucky. want life back. know that's everyone wants, helping going back anyway, even though things still bad.

you believe Russia &amp; China's numbers? OK

BTW seen numbers India? unable scared COViD also exhibit lack access.

I really think intellectually honest put ""I get cancer treatment hospital full"" category ""I get cancer treatment got canceled hospital despite space me"", ""I get cancer treatment news said would die go hospital"".

The first, yes, due pandemic. second Government policies third media-induced fear.

If hospital indeed full. sure, count due pandemic. Otherwise, no.

Governments media need blood hands people missing treatments even plenty space hospitals. deadliest overall deaths going down. That‚Äôs title says **from COVID-19**. national policy though. 
  
  
Plenty states, even Republican governors, slowing testing.
  
 
I plenty suspicions slowdown TX deliberate, seen evidence.
  
  
Without evidence without knowing much what's going testing ground Texas, I'm going start accusing state government deliberately. fair, significant change usually takes longer one night. late November developed cough lasted 6 weeks. almost constantly coughing. Went Dr. twice time, x-ray showed upper respiratory infection. know official statements CDC would say way Covid time, can't help think back mind did. I'm Pakistani resident myself. government NOTHING stop disease spread. opened everything knowing people keeping distance safety measures. somehow numbers go (which I'm sispeciously pray God true disease ending) govt. Wants credit. what? Jack shit. Doctors everything. They're one fighting civilians suffering govts. hypocritical policies. odds suffering long-term?  I'm trying argue. would like understand. self promoting? I'm looking data/information. going used anything self interest. I'm ecologist natural curiosity everything. I'm also parent wanted know people getting this. I'm sorry rules. survey coronavirus. prefer facebook marks warning links better information simply removing. best way ensure lots people seek defend false narrative try ban it. feeds persecution narrative.

Also, know true is, people reporting finding content removed little left behind barely know crossed line arbitration. people think understand posted shouldn't, creates resentment, undermines trust needs built meaningful fact checking. US still relatively low country-wide community spread, multiple articles people ‚Äúno idea caught it, careful,‚Äù actually looked stories would always several obvious avenues transmission (shared living spaces essential workers, meeting family also ‚Äúso careful,‚Äù etc). 

Basically, think it‚Äôs best practices assume people ~have idea got it~ probably got interaction they‚Äôre either a) thinking exposure possibility, b) choosing disclose. might t-cell memory previous coronavirus exposure (non-COVID19), colds. Interesting, thought jobs going go back already been. office delayed return indefinitely, supposed June, July, August, idea. people want visit Iceland. Folks check doctor case. statement apply everyone. saying, US 3.2x less people time. Times also article subscription blocked. additional base line numbers. Trust me, ground python better rewriting anything cobol Correct!  would also accepted ""Viking Power"" 40% state. Dallas. Obviously still pretty bad. happy, PLEASE VOTE. avoidable. Incompetence negligence. everyone freaking this, nobody forcing go. also protects rhesus monkeys. Welp, see comin'. actually know many people got 1918 flu asymptomatic mild/ cold-like symptoms. modern influenza, 50% influenza infections asymptomatic.

&amp;#x200B;

In general though, Influenza lower R0 Covid, people existing immunities various strains influenza earlier life vaccines. Covid completely new people's immune systems. beg, lied wanted government enough time seize masks circulation sell hospitals needed most. said make masks wear them, yeah, help. Yeah lot people threw ""it kills 1% people! That's nothing!"" Without acknowledging fact even half population got Covid that's still 1.6 million people dead. Hell even quarter population that's still 860k dead. 


And that's discounting deaths sure Covid hospitals full people normally could saved something else wrong die treated. skin color factor. UVB rays blocked/deflected angle light atmosphere, matter much time out, creating VIT D.  

I say 1-2 hours, said 10-2 hours needed (as opposed morning/evening hours). I'm also fair redditor, auburn hair, spends quite bit time sun summer (covered, sunscreened necessary) low VitD. 

the best time get VitD production sun high, shadow shorter are. memory then.

I get didn‚Äôt want people buying masks. ‚Äúpolitics‚Äù driving force doesn‚Äôt mean didn‚Äôt mislead American people (right wrong consider lie). damaged credibility especially among uneducated prone believing conspiracy theories. friends Midwest use example shouldn‚Äôt wear masks day. really wish didn‚Äôt repeatedly explain went that, barriers reduce transmission virus, etc. It‚Äôs exhausting. Fauci might pleased we‚Äôre (in U.S.) actions March different. I‚Äôm saying. certainly could wrong. Sweet get sit back nothing months end getting paid 6 figures. Yes MeriCa. Btw pay them. mass graves ditches right wing version ""protests spread covid.""  Number deaths decreased since April. ""Avlida per dag"":  
ICU admittance, hospitalizations, cases also decreasing since April.

In April swedes vacation stayed summer homes. yet number deaths decreased. numbers went death toll small people vacation homes summer. High cases April August, would support that, right?

 
No disagree. explain decrease since April. Although swedes access summer house, solo houses woods, lake etc. reports rather crowded places summer, e.g. west coast, Gotland, √ñland, Scania/Sk√•ne.  


Also small increase cases last weeks (mainly age group 20-29, somewhat 30-39), opposite woman says. 


To say decrease due summer houses big simplifications, disregarding measures taken since Marsh. strict lockdown, were, still is, measures. like nothing waited summer. 


(Usually summer affect season flu, people spend time outside, either explains decrease since April.) Neither also numbers get fudged. Don‚Äòt forget that. going get another $1,200 check. stimulus package would small that. always throw Trillions big donors. can't help little people. campaign talk wanting help us small folk, well, actions speak louder words. incumbent reelected. imagine history lesson 40 years school still exist. call 2020 ‚ÄúThe year started Great Genocide‚Äù Trump listed president along Kemp governors criminals. would like history books include sort redemption people Politicians get karma arrests! Lots farm land. Lots cattle. I'm actually pretty sure last month. Even though tested negative, basically every major symptom except breathing issues lasted solid 10 days, unusual me. sick years. doctor explain felt like false negative logical explanation. daughter also showing symptoms quite long. Whoa whoa buddy want comment deleted? dare you!

(lol one did, modify post - used M-word) Good article, thanks. add that. also said didn‚Äôt enough data mode transmission time. It‚Äôs typically per 100k general. It‚Äôs per capita count Kemp bends knee. Well, think wrong. said public buy masks absolutely true time. could added sacrifice meant protect health care workers, would meant every selfish ass country would ignore him. would mean dead Doctors Nurses.

When Trump learned enough masks, chose denial misinformation. Fauci saw enough, could see went people busy risking life save others. Blame will. Also, friends idiots? ""Great Again"" yet? threshold herd immunity COVID may low 20%. *How world-wide biological class-action lawsuit?* cool Georgia, learning history.

If put statues honoring 1918 virus heroically killed Americans, maybe would've learned? Read much? Ummm yes 0.1 obviously alot less 1.0%. point said clear truth...people sub want hear. 1.0% rate covid 10 times (or around there) worse normal yearly flu. would great use meme guy shooting guy
""They even treat us like humans anymore""
""They never did"" Sorry funds going sustain Trump families business. Go ahead look up. Supposed millionaires took tax payer money. smug again? (Death) care serfs get back work.
Fixed would say case Mardi Gras, issue people standing close together outside rather issue hundreds thousands people transiting airports, sleeping hotel rooms 2-3x capacity, drinking extremely crowded bars, on.

That said, Mardi Gras different either beach examples ferries, 6-7 hours standing next people watching parades shoulder-to-shoulder crush.

It definitely anecdotal, see, expert consensus still appears outdoors transmission - especially warm weather ""active"" places (parks, beaches, trails) - significantly lower transmission kind indoor activity, even six feet distance enforced. say someone supports notion nationwide lockdown 6 weeks burn transmission rates out. think pretty clear prelimary evidence suggests indeed smart enough repeat it. Borders (city/state/county/country) imaginary lines anyway You‚Äôre alone, like wearing masks anonymous store. wild conversation. get nonsense coping mechanism? Moreover - ever actually work? get people worked way you‚Äôre looking find strangers internet doctorates six-figure salaries aren‚Äôt interested ramblings IQ (a hilariously mild insult coming someone doesn‚Äôt know difference ‚Äòyour‚Äô ‚Äòyou‚Äôre‚Äô un-ironically used nonexistent phrase ‚Äòattorney work‚Äô)

Either way, hope find peace, brother! Stay safe! Sure did! You? Yep, lot lives tragically lost people go bars clubs. sad. mitigation strategies work flu. Vaccines like.

And can‚Äôt dance around eugenics QALY statistic. That‚Äôs is. You‚Äôre old? don‚Äôt matter. That‚Äôs basically means. Time put pasture. Sacrifice altar capitalism.

Economic costs much easily handled, evidenced rest world getting back work falling apart. **RUSSIAN** companies

FTFY Gazprom I‚Äôm sorry even outdoor. Let‚Äôs fucking take out. Jesus Christ. It‚Äôs 107 degrees Southern California right people still feel need eat out. Like really worth spending 60 dollars something cook home less? really worth risking life?  What? course dip next year next year less people around die. they're, know, dead? Mortality also lot higher older people older people generally higher likelihood dying younger person. Comparing next year's mortality prove say much value died covid not. Got news ya, life fair either. Hence hundreds thousands people dead COVID.

Not everything going perfect, crucify everything perfect. Remember 2000+ days? shit scary. would produce vaccine. said longest time didn‚Äôt COVID outbreaks pneumonia cases skyrocketed reason. Well guess America's fucked. worries! great day depends material. study looked fleece neck gaiter. We‚Äôre going need masks long time come, even vaccine comes along..... Hot glue! Shut fuuuuuck upppp Protesting open schools really?

""please sir let die choking ventilator"" helps argument. care anybody themselves. simple. people emigrate countries typically reason here, whether marriage, work, (most typically) better opportunities. course think US better home countries. could quit bring country economy screeching halt, anti-masker jackasses along million-dollar-ad-making-hypocritical-uber-capitalist-bosses chains would woken cozy slumber.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Makes sense, unfortunately. pandemic, policies.  April go Urgent Care got blood infection cut armpit....red line, fever, move arm without severe pain....

I terrified going almost wanted wait out...until husband directed hypochondriac butt Google......so decided Urgent Care would less crowded

NOBODY there....

The staff interested N95 masks purchased late January China shut downs....(we gave unopened 3 pack kept car).

I get COVID.....but sure sweated 2 weeks.... Right personal experience UK masks miracle cure, compulsory masks cases going Europe shows lockdown real way reducing cases one afford comments based general common knowledge. I'm sure post seems advocating killing poor helpless teachers. Send kids back don't, honestly could care less. Go strike indefinitely assuages fears dying virus. 

The commentary simply outlining cold truth vast cross section today's kids effectively socially degenerate. unfortunate is, couple hours in-person instruction might literally interaction many kids get day talk hopefully laugh kids age. We're currently ranked 8th world deaths per capita. Perspective important. single day winning. thing get okay, government leaders stupid, corrupt, slimy assholes. excuse regular citizens *following assholes' orders??* Can't people think themselves?? Trump tell people drink bleach wants, mean I'm going it!! Wow, humanity one failed alien experiment nothing else. how? /r/latestagrcapitalism Go hang biker bar night. dated biker chick fucking hated it. Underneath ""tough"" stupid looking clothes they're bunch alcoholic losers act like they're still high school probably finish high school that's they're mentally life. drunken drama gossiping every night. see bikers I'm embarrassed them. like dudes LARPing renn fair. might fun everyone thinks look like huge dork nobody impressed. check doctor, another round blood tests cat scan coming soon so... hospitals needing care. comparison like leper camps never able return society. already see America differently known test positive treated general public even testing negative. archive [http://archive.vn/MKhZn](http://archive.vn/MKhZn)  Push lightly stem. doesn‚Äôt wiggle come out, it‚Äôs ready yet. pops off, eaten within 48 hours.

If there‚Äôs stem, let someone else play avocado roulette. 3,400,000 it, excess mortality 65,000, would infer mortality rate 1.9%. Seems right, 19x higher flu. We're still waiting Easter miracle... Strike....period ! second infections reported months now. get debunked, fact immune systems aren‚Äôt computers, immunity isn‚Äôt binary concept. Immune systems idiosyncrasies, people come diseases compromise working immune systems, etc, good news rare enough individual re-infection rare enough make world news.

But time tell long immunity lasts average. would encourage actually compare quality life index, economic mobility, host real metrics show US really leading pack. country perfect, fantasy Americans lived home perfect washing away internet COVID.

 US 19 happiness

 US 44 infant mortality

 US #1 prisoners per capita

 US 27th social mobility worked Kroger college. never treated grocery workers like humans.

Old people poor people worst. groups serious entitlement issues. one suggested virus going away. That's straw man.

The United States would significantly better New Zealand did. would amount sick people deaths drastically lower, economy would significantly better. U.S. going much worse half country pretending virus hoax regions either shut back hide virus cases next year more. wait! That's COMMUNISM! /s lot stuff inherited people housing likely move deaths occur people outside worlforce likely get affected. Due privatized pension system US would likely increase profits insurance agencies.  Oh no, totally agree, they're worst scum Earth. wanted highlight fact going people work IRS, institution. might little okay tactic institution, 100% evil go individual people. Stupid question know: can't walk unionize day? Companies can't make money workers... (ELI5?) young guy survived, amputate fingers.

So always like die hunky dory. OK, small portion still none. filter small portion, too? lot things would fine everyone wearing masks, aren't. months since US shot containment. Likely already late time started recognized end February we're dead can't vote True. definitely agree scenario though. Unless you‚Äôre antimasker it‚Äôs pretty obvious mask worn haha Georgia, Governor made statement ""curve starting flatten."" literally could truth. I'm looking graph cases Georgia trying figure exactly curve flattening. seen massive increase cases, temporary hospitals set housing COVID patients again. people going believe said he's Governor. ""Excessive Death"" -.- axis title  husband convinced turn zombie lol gotta wait travel bans lift... fuck... cover valve tape something, still exhale filters. People also seem forget employees spread too. one cook back sneezes. Boom. It‚Äôs too. Combine people getting unemployment sick high propensity people reporting don‚Äôt symptoms. shouldn‚Äôt semblance normalcy asshattery like exists. New Zealand locked 4 FUCKING CASES. county 2 million ~950 positive cases averaging around ten deaths day. It‚Äôs fucking madness. one recently escaped Walmart worst 26 months 61 years attest company care less employees. I‚Äôd much rather competent career politician incompetent, criminal, pedophile goals Thats works, fortunately. Studies show antibodies decline become stable. previously tested antibodies they've got sort immunity least 6 months...maybe dont know sure. Yeah, people reddit dont know anyways. way normal life burn shit down.

Americans absolutely responsible America is, critical mass population voted Trump.

What done fix problem? book? Please take me! necessary virus arrived earlier? would deaths spiked sooner true? Ok let's cut crap now. I'm ""belittling"" anything. know vast majority people die this.

I part problem thankfully never nationwide lockdown. two nurses saw dining indoors yesterday part problem too?

How instead trying blame individuals accept stay figure live it? I'm especially curious kind super powers get. alien DNA demon semen?


/s Since drink shit ton milk everyday. Good news gueess! Vented N95 protect others indirectly protecting yourself, can't spread Covid get Covid first. 

However airlines cannot tell used N95 masks day one, put one first time ever fly. rule makes sense. No, replied directly someone railing Bush, saying could expect legitimate elections gone ""for decades before."" Whatever. still basically say US elections illegitimate, BS. 

I'm out. wasnt rationale internment camps?

No. Internment camps people *suspected* enemy sympathizers. proof interned, recent genetic lineage.

Taking highly infectious sick people forcing stay hospital sick worlds away that. let someone with, example, ebola walk around community. Obviously COVID ebola reasoning same. low 9/11 presidency ‚Äúmeh‚Äù point. Leaders love crisis often boosts popularity. possible? heard hasn‚Äôt anything! public health policy requires 100% near 100% compliance shitty public health policy think one understands things work, I'd lot happier valve respirator effective people think is, isn't. I'm guessing 10% exhale goes valve. Yep, there‚Äôs reason far right crusading defund education last decades. Yeah, fully expect watch America implode fail lifetime. fuck loser replying 2 week old comment I'm opinion better safe sorry adding layer extra protection harm. fight hard? reality, tight fitting elastomeric mask either emitting equal amount even less droplets exiting valve compared user wearing even best fitting surgical mask

Can provide source that?  conservative site, Federalist Society said DeVos holding events listed public calendar, including several sponsored conservative site. education secretary also participated events private schools advocacy vouchers, including roundtable July 23 private Christian school DeVos‚Äô office told NBC constant contact governors state superintendents virtually Noelle Ellerson Ng, associate executive director advocacy School Superintendents Association, represents public school superintendents 49 states, said group hasn‚Äôt heard DeVos year.

So... basically she‚Äôs busy education related things one organization upset hasn‚Äôt attended **their** meeting.

Apparently means ‚Äúshe isn‚Äôt job.‚Äù
Yeah, okay.

Imagine inviting boss meetings calling slacker they‚Äôre busy things work. it. We're different countries.  It‚Äôs sort reason it‚Äôs dangerous large people go general anesthesia- larger bodies need larger doses effective. gave 100 lb person amount morphine 400 lb person needs would surely kill them. Sure still hell long way prison isolation know it. true EU countries yet results also vastly different. Dang! nice!

Meanwhile, US... OK, well think guess ignore experts CDC say otherwise. Strong argument. hospital worked beginning pandemic way behind providing masks employees patients. Luckily live area hit hard beginning. obvious admin wanted us physically come work possible. trained people created systems allow many us work home - took away (in June). decided I'd enough - clearly care protecting us protect myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel terrible peers still work there. want hear anymore healthcare workers, service-sector workers heroes. sacrificial lambs. Make mistake US citizens wage slaves corporate overlords give two shits you. People scared covid go hospitals treatable illnesses. Suicides. Overdoses. Alcoholism. People missed cancer diagnoses. Murders gone areas. Telling lie 100 times hard keep straight Like robots. sure I'm downvoted speaking truth. Except armed guards preventing entering Roll Tide opening schools less 2 weeks. Nothing going change maybe children start dying. whole situation fucked. hate living Texas that's huge problem system. friend mines dad hospital 9 weeks total. 5 intensive care, 4 ward. (luckily) survived barely. died week 5 counted. get theory behind weed ""recovered April, gets hit bus June"" type stuff surely best way trust doctors accurately record cause death count like that? idea case (other government appearing ignore experts... teachers another timely example). office still trying open right now..... There‚Äôs theories stole vaccine oxford mean, really surprised.

Sorry say along schools last places open, least extreme restrictions place.  Keep transmission 1:1. That's goal. kid's lives problem, even direct risk catching stands, fact activity combined everything else puts us back exponential curve. 

As long keep talking risk individuals increase transmission rate, perpetuate myth need consider danger participants activity, danger everyone everywhere people doing. What‚Äôs stopping go fucking rights!!
You right drop half mass mother fucker Ummmmm no. human psychology fact eyes see 30 percent people liberal city LA wear masks. Therefore can‚Äôt even force left leaning people wear masks. can‚Äôt force police ticket, police don‚Äôt even wear masks times. left cult right used be. Joe Biden fucking savior. 

Conspiracy maniac? Alright idiot. Think JFK killed Lee Harvey Oswald, think 9/11 wasn‚Äôt already known let happen, think US gov interest mind combine Food Drug FDA order poison hook fucking medication. mindless, that‚Äôs fucking you. country fucked. We're watching twilight America point. is, millions people **tested positive** UK

While true, antibody studies they've indicates least 3.4 million people virus whether confirmed via test not. alrighty then. I.e. Olympics weird Halloween kind holiday takes months preparation, unless go all-in decoration side it. terms ""Halloween candy"" people buy months ahead time, especially South Mississippi lucky chocolate molten pool goo time takes go car front door. That‚Äôs half 9/11 deaths Right wing troll. especially seeing kids parents wont let kids plays kids tested positive past even post recovery. also ton people talking reddits know teacher reddit teachers expressed concerned bei ng teacher tests positive first shutting school done treated person rest career. mean, yeah, objectively getting better, significantly nothing proud of. getting better we're something right, getting better there's nowhere go (or sideways). problem moment get worse since really anything better months ago. 


It wont get noticeably better least 6 months, think. mean, back normal levels new unemployment claims unemployment dropping 10% continuing drop. thought trolling looked apparently true lol.  Spanish flu wasn‚Äôt deadly initially. It‚Äôs fall mutation deadly believe. simply treat everyone way get treated. ups downs bagger. Also moving produce soon :) Testing irrelevant world closing 300k cases day. We're fucked. Lmao making joke providing anecdotal evidence says anecdotal evidence good. Nursing home work same. us CNAs nurses getting burnt mentally physically threatened fired pandemic, time ever hear administration scolded good job. ""should glad job"" ""you easier anywhere else."" 
No temporary raise, hazard pay, ""thank you. appreciate you."" Two workers fired got tired harrasment quit. can't speak find ways write us threaten disciplinary action us. employee morale. disposable pawns game money care. difference vast. Everything order process chain responsibility way done. one bit necessarily translates efficiency. Viral load?

Because else world southern US uses air conditioning? Good luck sis! Hoping gets answers. stories like make ashamed American. country depraved. never convince people arguing 20 years.

I'm Florida easy get tested unless get referral doctor even knowingly exposed infected person. So, death toll rival 1918 pandemic? missing something? Supposedly makes nose, get infected ACE2 receptors there, otherwise unlikely.  Lies. Damn lies statistics. 10,000 dead Covid/ week. You‚Äôre cherry picking ignoring OBVIOUS. orange god minions opened country, murdered thousands. you‚Äôre complicit. I‚Äôm ashamed you‚Äôre fellow countryman. Good luck getting blood hands. See November. said like look testing statistics. general people observe testing statistics...... 
For record, less people ""getting sick"" reason test fewer people. need know rate infected, testing objective way obtain information. would even objectively know less people sick without testing high proportion general population?...

 I'm curious linguistic history grip vs flu Don‚Äôt read title. Look key graph better yet, read whole thing. fascinating idea. I'm endorsing it, damn, interesting thought... It‚Äôs anyone works healthcare. Honestly nurse I‚Äôve guilty going sick things colds. don‚Äôt get sick time. PTO tike people use vacation. option going work sick taking losing vacation time nurses choose go sick lol money printer broke \[Austin Powers voice\] That's man, baby! That‚Äôs call petri dish! Battle royale school, last one standing gets chicken dinner mean behaves like lot viruses? RKI track anything except Germany.

As CDC, numbers sent White House. incomplete. notes recent numbers get adjusted generally get 60% reported deaths time frame.  dont agree. going go hard lockdown businesses struggled reopened going fucked plans timelines thrown toilet again.

And lets say get cases 0 reopen. 

Then 2 months get 7 cases somehow *because nobody really idea Covid transmits*.

So then? Back lockdown? Again? simply destroy country. handful cases probably wont even result fatalities!  crazy future envision.

Just ""on/off/on/off/on/off"" .. when? no, can't trust anyone quarantine home... many cases people ignoring that.

And false positives? single parent get tested positive? dog could take care quarantined home?

We trust people drink drive, right? dont lock downstairs basement bar saying ""If let *might* get car drive kill someone. cant trust lock up."" 

The *vast* majority positive cases dont require hospitalization. Somewhere order 80% covid cases recover home.

You arent going trust *any* people? kind society live in? trust dangerous? trust get car? trust operate heavy machinery? poor girl took photo gotten threats. take photo show us absurdity. still first wave raging pandemic numbers increasing every day, current infected/death numbers yet final totals.

You can't compare final results 1918 flu (which came years multiple waves, second significantly deadlier first) first months first wave current pandemic. looked first wave 1918 flu, seem like big deal, either.

Compare final numbers pandemics 3-5 years (or however long thing lasts) draw conclusions lethality long term side effects.

I suspect long term side effects actually much bigger issue society lethality, seeing significant percentage so-called ""recovered"" people long-lasting organ damage and/or debilitating CFS-like symptoms. No. don't. literally message directly page Number deaths reported page total number deaths received coded date analysis represent deaths occurred period. Data incomplete lag time death occurred death certificate completed, submitted NCHS processed reporting purposes. delay range 1 week 8 weeks more, depending jurisdiction cause death

You also see similar message hovering bars says ""Data recent weeks incomplete""

Deaths gonna drop 10% week. simply done death totals reported yet. 

You search around find earlier versions chart. example, [see here]( version chart. Notice seven bars ahead excess death line. puts data May 9th. See recent data fairly close excess death line is.

Now look chart today. data May 9th significantly away chart. (as couple weeks it, lesser degree). definitively shows data last couple weeks reported accurately show real excess death totals week were, gotta wait bit. Thank you. said *you* better, measures taken better.

Anyone choosing behave way increases people's risk contracting deadly disease deserve fined jailed pandemic protect rest us. admit wrong. hard do?

Sure, always admit wrong, find something wrong first.  Smack pi√±atas till candy falls excess deaths, labeled quite clearly title well link provided.

Is different link intended send maybe? Going high score. Oh turns Senate considered ""essential."" interesting... perhaps get deluxe slicer? know one big enough watermelons? Muh economy time get back election season nothing gets done everyone working campaigns Deaths per 100,000

Sweden	- 56.66

Denmark - 10.71

Finland - 6.03

Norway	- 4.82

The facts speak themselves. far, highest fatality rate Scandinavia. others even close.

The developed nations done worse Western Europe hit early hard. includes UK, made mistake starting version Swedish approach.

There can't handle truth believe downvoting alter reality. won't. OK. think contributes decrease? best, wish well. Lmao! Votes don‚Äôt matter presidential level. think you‚Äôd know now. Slavery nothing proud of. inciting insurection based nasty institution. fans working...

Yet somehow remain rich employed. spot on. type person welded house. Hmmm, could be? question ages. One thing pisses ""create space Congressional Democrats administration"" remark. Listen human turtle (McConnel), Senator fluffer president. extension executive branch goes left well things change November. Work other, independent whoever president is. Kings Queens, stop pretending like need answer President get politics.

Ok I'm taking deep breath gonna go chill happier sub. world op say struck paranoid? neighbor COVID-19, interacted without masks! Outdoors not, extremely high risk! know someone infected there‚Äôs basically way around deemed safe. One brothers named Kevin. 
His wife named Karen. 

They far opposite stereotypical ""Kevins"" ""Karens"" almost feels ironic me. Reads like vegan propaganda article. get actual facts post stuff or? That's possible, likely, caught weeks London UK locked pretty hard. ignore science doesn‚Äôt suit agenda push then.  makes sense. sports journalist social distanced, wore masks public, sanitized yet caught COVID cause chose one weekend eat outdoor patio restaurant once.

If unlucky enough downstream asymptomatic spreader breathe enough particles in, get sick.

The real protection space someone might may give you.

Just anecdotally seen anyone it, mean happen. R continues climb reach point businesses least 1 positive person establishment times. stayed away 4 weeks, drop infection rates drastically since can't spread beyond bubble.

I relatives went restaurants stores. 5 infected one passed away. gamble. Hopefully requiring masks distancing enough piss userbase voting. FB. Hold on, let go find surprised face swede know talking üòä Decades ago swedes summer vacation specific weeks factories closed down. things different today. people 5 weeks vacation per year. take vacation whenever want. take week Christmas, week Easter 3 weeks summer. 
This year bit special virus many took 3 weeks summer vacation soon kids got school. back work month now.

And look stats covering covid deaths Sweden, see working people die. people die covid old people several pre-existing conditions. logic reason numbers deaths increase Sweden. schools universities operating dining facilities? changes things.

But people classroom wearing masks spreader they're distanced. Yeah eating outside Georgia summer literal hell. drop quantity tests could cause rise positivity rate, particularly testing reserved pretty clearly sick without already. Yes, maskless rump supporting ,racist,etc ect Fuck this. I'm grateful job I've managed keep thing 0 animosity others taking unemployment baseline basic human empathy. Yes. article pointed higher rates Scandinavian countries. 

I've hearing US conservatives point Sweden success interested see article point people might claim right also might case. Yeah disturbing possibility. Scrubbing package soap water maybe option case?

Horrifying true. sad. civil war reenactments SOUTH WINS. also several chronic health issues. anemia critically bad bed ridden several months. struggled walk bathroom without fainting body became deconditioned struggle daily tasks even now.

Many people chronic illness also suffer depression may struggle get mental healthcare need overcome it.

I sad say disability yet lack empathy understand everyone ability make better. 

Of course best good bodies. also best act love understanding lift up. hope future. 20 workers dying one facility would national headlines. Dude CIA PROTECTS American interest

They judgment. think better hold back releasing get concessions China - hesitate so. 


DO really think CIA makes discoveries public ASAP? really naive? think pinpointed it. Somehow science became political QCult believes everything messiah doles them. sad part posted subreddit different post lmao! Smarter parents pull kids school. Yes. Bigotry. either stupid malicious. Pick. Schools Georgia opened already closing. camelbak adult diaper. dont agree. going go hard lockdown businesses struggled reopened going fucked plans timelines thrown toilet again.

They already couple months we're everything open without restrictions... would say better anyone. prefer go half gas next months top 6 months already passed, cases, deaths suffering, full gas months half gas others? know prefer. then? Back lockdown? Again? simply destroy country. handful cases probably wont even result fatalities! crazy future envision.

How dismissive humans lives? one certain cases result fatalities, nothing done, cases happen people die. false positives? single parent get tested positive? dog could take care quarantined home?

I think happened there. facility quarentine new arrivals think, traveling abroad already plans motion cover quarentine arriving. Maybe history under-estimating. Let‚Äôs see. RemindMe! 1 week.  went rave Saturday miss going evenings cope I‚Äôm adult, we‚Äôre saving loads money. pearls wisdom? India *53* cities 1 million people. number 32 1991.  call bullshit... yep, things could've learned SK, China, Italy many others. instead chose lead way followers like Brazil India. Overworked administrators, mixups, tested corpse found positive, family denial uninformed, knows. think students don‚Äôt eat schools universities? high percentage type people died Sweden Covid (i.e., multiple conditions) died Norway reason.

What‚Äôs ‚Äúhigh‚Äù? 50%, would one find statistic? It'd safer, private schools going remote. Including Baron Trump's expensive prep school. 

Personally love dad shelling thousands kid take Kahoot quizzes online poor kids class home. That's art deal. Ugh ridiculous!!!!! closed schools number cases go reopen safety! Seriously, Georgiaüò§ Plus, it‚Äôs established virus never going away. Fauci started temper optimism vaccine effectiveness, take least year get everyone initial shot boosters.

So no, world now. there‚Äôs worrying studies coming out. take chance? beggars belief weird, wild, arbitrary virus is.

Hope make full recovery get mild case. Colleagues came struggled symptoms swore salt steam baths. home remedy peer-reviewed evidence support it, colleagues said helped breathing helped alleviate worst aches pains. people just. don't. get. it. 

Sooner later, people going realize deal virus FIRST none schemes going work. Otherwise, continue people die larger larger rate, watch hospitalizations continue rise, watch oh precious economy continue drop. anyone download states? read sending covid-19 numbers WH.

This tracks well countries bad outbreaks like Sweden showing total deaths within normal threshold well. data isn‚Äôt anomaly.  people going sit mansions watch millions starve death. can't anything it. IMO...Yes No. 
Yes- less death good
No- means long term health effects like tethered kidney dialysis machine, hooked oxygen tank, heart disease including heart attacks, heart valve infections, pacemakers, even heart transplant. 

I‚Äôll home everyone sorts out. Like said, get head ass. 1,500 dead every day. Many would still alive weren‚Äôt ‚Äúenlightened philosophers‚Äù like saying many ways big deal. don‚Äôt need year year death averages know thousands dying. can't educate dead kid.  There‚Äôs much high speed testing capacity available. machines backordered next year already run high speed tests come back shortly don‚Äôt can‚Äôt. there‚Äôs also issues getting testing supplies. Pretty sure we've tested anybody even per capita June/July far August. Also death per capita nearly bad reports would believe. (You add whichever country want counters reason say catch touching mouth eyes.

I think mean context (and it‚Äôs poorly worded IMHO) Covid doesn‚Äôt ‚Äú**grow**‚Äù food food packaging. 

I believe trying counter prevent thinking along lines Covid similar salmonella, E-coli illnesses humans become infected contaminated water food. article: 

 

A Shelby church recently nearly 100 members test positive COVID-19 opened doors indoor services May.

Janet Poston, secretary Faith Baptist Church, said pastor, J. Barry Goodman, unavailable comment confirmed least 90 congregants tested positive COVID-19 beginning July.

The church located corner South Post Road South Lafayette Street far South Carolina border, according website, describes ‚Äúan old fashioned church contemporary world.‚Äù

**Recovering cases**

According relative church member want named, one elderly member died COVID-19 complications.

Poston said since first positive case reported, around 70 people recovered gone back work daily life ‚Äúthree four elderly‚Äù still hospital, although according Poston, improving daily. Since new cases reported two weeks, church plans hold indoor services Sunday.

Poston said although 90 sounds like lot, Faith Baptist many large families contributed high number, many cases originated people contracted virus work town.

Like businesses churches, Faith Baptist closed doors following initial stay-at-home order North Carolina Governor‚Äôs Office March.

Poston said membership 600 people, way fit everyone inside adequately maintain social distancing guidelines.

In mid-May, Faith Baptist opened back first cases virus reported July 14, closed doors moved services online.

Poston said July 15 though July 25 reported cases, aware new ones past two weeks.

She said church encouraged elderly vulnerable stay home.

‚ÄúWe conferred Health Department put social distancing place,‚Äù Poston said.

Pews distanced other, sanitizer available use. Lysol sprayed services. According Poston, church mandate masks.

‚ÄúAfter speaking Health Department said we‚Äôre everything right,‚Äù Poston said.

**COVID concerns**

She said one interesting thing learned children didn‚Äôt seem impacted severely adults experienced mild symptoms. said none children tested virus families told parents tested positive, assume children would well.

Poston said around 100 children attend church.

‚ÄúTechnically lot cases church, feel followed protocols,‚Äù Poston said.

Becky Adams, Shelby lives California, said relatives attend Faith Baptist, family member diagnosed COVID-19 mid-July.

Adams said relative contracted coronavirus direct result outbreak church, concerned impact community.

She said serve warning indoor gatherings still avoided risks high.

‚ÄúI deeply concerned continued spread coronavirus church effect wonderful people Shelby,‚Äù Adams said. ‚ÄúI believe important information outbreak publicized order people community understand deadly virus transmitted‚Äîindoors, crowds, people wearing masks.‚Äù

Adams said LA County lives, churches, indoor restaurants bars closed, number cases begun decline.

‚ÄúIf numbers start come down, live life normally continue go up,‚Äù said.

**‚ÄòHelp save lives‚Äô**

Throughout outbreak, Cleveland County Public Health Center involved keeping reported cases church.

‚ÄúThrough contact tracing, identified cluster 80 COVID-19 cases associated Faith Baptist Church,‚Äù said DeShay Oliver, deputy health director. ‚ÄúWe reached church spoke secretary lead pastor inform situation provide guidance recommendations. time discussion, shared already aware cases linked church already made decision cancel in-person services transitioned online parking lot services.‚Äù

Oliver said according health department records, Sunday would mark 14 days since last confirmed positive case reported. said staff follow church end week confirm additional cases.

Oliver said way able connect COVID-19 cases particular business organization person confirmed case shares information health department asked case investigation process.

‚ÄúIt extremely important people open honest case investigators contact tracers contact help prevent reduce spread virus others,‚Äù Oliver said. ‚ÄúSometimes people reluctant share information. want people understand won‚Äôt trouble face negative consequences sharing information direct contact with. Sharing information could help save lives.‚Äù

Oliver said could confirm death linked outbreak church due confidentiality reasons.

She said church informed health department follow recommended guidelines positive case identified, included social distancing, hand sanitizer, disinfecting services temperature checks symptom screenings well recommending masks.

‚ÄúThe health department continuing monitor situation ongoing communication church provide additional guidance needed,‚Äù Oliver said. ‚ÄúWe encouraged church remain virtual and/or outdoors minimum 14 days since last positive case.‚Äù What's scary Panther125 posting today potentially exposed acting like big deal. People like moron going fuck many others' lives. assume person covid. probability infecting others wearing mask, higher probability infecting others wearing mask valve. wrong saying ""you better"".

You selfish increasing risk others selfish reasons. 

Again, never said measures equal, said people bad knowingly causing protesters congregating large group. increases people's risk contracting deadly disease, not? BLM movement?

Put straw man away act like adult want continue conversation.

Try like adult, stop bothering me. What's frustrating many people think means regained jobs. No, means almost million people became unemployed top already unemployed. Well, there's simpler explanation - agree deadlocked, nothing. what's EAP? I'm going front let know know jack health insurance, seems labyrinthine overwhelms easily. 

I gender affirming surgeries want done I'm trying figure cover trying make sure mere ""cosmetic"" choices legit gender affirming, seem cover things like medicare like. bottle devil springs 151 vodka... shown study, still crucial isolate patients trace quarantine contacts early possible asymptomatic infection appears possible,‚Äù report 12:45pm, 25 Jan, 2020

Really drives home badly Northeast dropped ball (almost half deaths country there)- virus even arrive there, arrived west coast. 

And now, see south seems set badly north east - many extra months prepare take warning! Inexcusable. 

What's scary \*are\* experiencing 'warm weather hurts covid' effect, noticing underlying trend bad.

What part Canada? assure moving French Canada major culture shock many people english speaking/cultural areas. mention areas Canada still mostly indigenous languages/cultures. society, would looking jail time. *knew* would happen. get wait see many going die direct result intentionally ineffective leadership.

To think, two decades ago, people US riled idea Saddam Hussein gassed several thousand people. Enough tons people bought idea go liberate people Iraq mitigate threat biological weapons Iraq supposedly held.

Fast forward today people force fed equally terrible policy decisions resulting deaths ways things be. Source? Getting ready school... Could cite studies/data this? Two completely different companies ‚Äúbruh‚Äù think since US big country federal strategy restrict travel one region another. example, early days virus affecting people NorthEast absolutely restricted people traveling to/from regions contain spread there.

I blame corporate culture kowtowing customer demands. no, customer always right, fact they're often wrong right. people know get away smug entitled assholes companies actively reward it. believe saying overall state testing 45% lower month ago. hospitals testing less 50% patients. pound sardines like going style.  disgusting, lifesaving, haters!

I predict September. make it, baby! Reach motherfucking skyyyyyy! Gotta love people put words mouth. much prefer slice pepperoni pizza. going sue rest U.S. government, well state local governments ignoring concerns? Here's missing detail I'd like filled in;

Because they're toddlers. reap sow.

Vote.

Vote like matters.

Don't decide vote one issue like gun control abortion.

Vote someone willing compromise get something done.

Vote consensus building.

Vote someone actually work. NDA doesn‚Äôt mention bringing existence, that‚Äôs common knowledge. bars giving specific information could considered trade secret. Ask doctor know personally you‚Äôll probably hear thing. see either understand deaths take time report, thus last couple weeks gonna reported, understand intentionally spreading misleading information hopes people understand it.

Either way, stop spreading lie. say, magical place üòâ think would funded.

There studies going on, countries human. Quercetin study finished Turkey, example (results yet published) one Saudi Arabia.

I think Bill Gates back studies, instead giving advice opinions. good thing though, find it, spread world. least friends family benefits.

TL;DR: healthy, make sure Zinc vit deficient. get symptoms contact spreader, take Zinc Quercetin. 

The 2 sentences could saved thousands people... ""Quarantine"" ""Stay home, can, unless, you, don't, but, should, unless can't"" list Bill Gates said publicly expects end 2021. fucking sucks I'll take it. Obviously he's oracle, I'd like think knows roughly happening behind scenes make statements. end going downpeak hopefully downward trend starts sooner rather later. should, many people give fuck. could call ~~Jones~~Trumptown. Hey now, someone wiped desk. Idk else could ask for. unusual I'm sure even read CDC actually said valved purpose masks keep respiratory droplets reaching others aid **source control**. However, masks one-way valves vents allow air exhaled hole material, result expelled respiratory droplets reach others. type mask prevent person wearing mask transmitting COVID-19 others. Therefore, CDC recommend using masks **source control** exhalation valve vent.

So yes, I'm happy ignore advise since agree purpose mask **source control**. wan't back guidance data happy change position. think Virus around lot longer beginning year. probably got infected sometime last year long enough antibodies show up. would explain lot people 'catch it' affected badly; already previous year. know sick hell 2 half months end year last year. many fucking vacation days pricks even get PAY FOR?!?! paint thinner regulated FDA, might anyway. able hide excess Phenomia, Stroke deaths. Except I‚Äôm saying may have...intrinsic value? got source that? thing I've seen making claim cellphone pic graph passed around Facebook, turned inaccurate CDC Facebook warns people also confuses still don‚Äôt definitive answer question, 8 months pandemic congress utterly useless society country. stomp em. left right mentalied people get together form revolution people. fuck bullshit! politicians hijacked liberal conservative minded people! anything unite sides, shit like this. guess something 0.2% 0.3%.

And remember US numbers especially high poor NYC dealt virus too. overall think 15% 25% Americans already infected. take year school everywhere? you‚Äôre lefty, socialist trash like me, hold nose vote joe anyways. That's true. I'm mystified arbitrary capricious virus is. *High School*? That's typo. *Day Care.* /s Man read finishing dinner, trying convince beautiful children leave room finish (per rule) ask question question can't listen basically wildlings point.

I would suck dick go eat peaceful meal others cooked served quiet place, watch playoff hockey bar. 

WHO'S DICK SUCK AROUND GET NATIONAL PLAN GET SHIT CONTROL? don‚Äôt online it‚Äôs excuse. person classes foreign students keep visas. It‚Äôs nice thing do. mean, introvert though. either tries grab power flees Russia. Half team found guilty conspiracy united states, that's incredibly weak-willed Republican prosecutors investigators always go easy own. nice enjoy summer vacations people go hungry get evicted actual background, anything blocking outside might better practice places starting ban masks valves outright. time expertise examine valved mask customer offer disposable go top worn instead. Misleading headline 

They recommend masks situations social distancing possible situation like 15 minutes.
The recommendation also people aged 15 older. Alright, buddy. 

But doesnt talking experimental, prophylactic treatment form breach tight NDA? Even acknowledging exists? Ah, yes, another installment ""no shit"" magazine. preliminary studies showing Covid affects different blood types differently- type less likely affected A, B AB, example. studies shown increased use alcohol strengthens likelihood someone coming virus, makes sense since booze messes immune system. Stupid can‚Äôt add, sure multiply. standard seasonal flu measured around 1% fatality rate worldwide. mean IFR sustained, long term reaponses? hear saying, Democrats want 3 trillion dollars Republicans asking 1.5 trillion dollars. need 2 trillion dollars more? Effing politicians, always effing politicians. Politicians worried pockets, special interest groups lobbyists people elected them. perfectly common illnesses cause things, though. I've annoyingly persistent coughs before. Many people claim symptoms disease early on, seen doctors saying seeing anything unusual period. time, doctor confused symptoms? say unlike respiratory infections they'd seen? 5% UK population. Wow. Never would guessed, can‚Äôt hope handouts todoshit rare, actually informed comment But...NZ eliminate disease, assumed did. reality disease never left people state despair since took precautions, sacrificed everything... still successful. Yes. countries managed well light short lockdown even without masks. Like Denmark. Shocked Pikachu face Norte Dame open allready? Pregnancy tests go down, doesn‚Äôt mean less kids born. agree, Dr. Fauci. already covid never knew. Fellow frontliner here, Respiratory Therapist. story mine, although antibody tests, know titers converted.

The issue gets really sick likely multifactoral, one reason prediction devil. researchers worldwide hot Covid's trail learning massively. fact, 35 years RT, never seen level focused research one single problem like now. Sometimes seems entire world's medical research machinery repurposed.

There data makes sense, vitamin early preliminary data quality suggest need study, nothing really. data regarding interferon interesting. Covid seems inhibit endogenous interferon function, inhibiting protein's specific antiviral function, basically means inhibits host's defence it. Furthermore, appears people certain genetic defect interferon production/release significantly prone severe disease, also makes sense. And, recent early research suggests inhaled interferon protein may offer substantial benefit reversing and/or preventing severe disease. early data, three unrelated studies example world fitting together pieces Covid puzzle, one possible explaination disparity disease severity. Texas? even read article news, think anyone would check link random comment? far looks like vaccines inducing even stronger immune response, without symptoms associated disease. Thank saying this. really tough time, got it. [Testing Hospitalizations data scrubbed white house.  However, can't hide bodies. Yet I‚Äôm still getting flak It‚Äôs us actually live NH fucking up. We‚Äôve got one best responses thing going. It‚Äôs LARPing assholes state flood Laconia going fuck thing up. They‚Äôre going get lot us killed won‚Äôt single thing protect everyone else selfish stupidity. 

They‚Äôre going bump rates right back up. Assholes. zero data back up, think likely catch covid indoors buying groceries outdoor eating restaurant.

Additionally everyone cook, either physically due limitations staying.

Eating out/take valuable life lines thrown struggling local business help keep afloat.

As move 6th? month this, people need able leave homes then. Expecting people sit home 6 months unreasonable, lead cabin fever. fact, since major symptoms cabin fever irrationality paranoia, Id' say clear huge swath American public already experiencing it. check daily here: funding increased testing open schools. Yeah people stop assuming poor, eat badly, don‚Äôt know wash hands oddball explanations sound weirdly racist. Upper middle class, mixed race, loads hand washing vitamins here- covid laid waste children I. lungs damaged. Barely touched caucasian spouse blood type o, muscle joint pains.

And one local Florida news article made rounds generated silly talking point 2 months ago. Personally, I‚Äôm even take anymore.

Finally someone else functioning brain. sister heart cath done. hospital tested seven days procedure. day procedure, results weren‚Äôt ready. doc decided rapid Covid test. came back negative. go ahead heart test. she‚Äôs procedure, original test comes back (this one goes way nose). Turns positive. doc freaks little tells sister test week ago positive wouldn‚Äôt done heart cath known. decided another Covid test released her. back eight hours negative. We‚Äôre left wondering Covid not. Doctors told felt didn‚Äôt time cath - main concern, could ill tested first time. She‚Äôs thinking getting antibody test clarification. Anyone subreddit similar experience testing? enough bullshit Chinese bots upvote propaganda Nope, vaccine 100% effective still chance getting infected. retired nurse wearing masks data shows epidemiologists transmission reached point unlikely. means might still masking years come... vaccine overnight passport back old life. hate it‚Äôs worth.

I promise everyone dying ventilator wished worn mask. Thank you. wearing stethoscope around neck know doctor? lol  time people saying reason shut anything US way 60k people could ever die this. said shut would 100k more. killed 100k changed tune like ""we never shut down, like said originally, bad""

No, constantly hear ""see, barely anyone died shutdown, therefore worth shutting deaths""

Flawless logic, course. actually turn ssid. Genius idea hahaha noticed article date prior change Covid info going White House instead. still believe US honest? I'm sure China.  really matter either common folk China believe.

It‚Äôs due covid. It‚Äôs due stupid policies governments implemented deal virus. excessive deaths purely governments. Thats still 10-20 times worse flu though. one seriously believes Canada-U.S. border closed forever

edit add: career server decade (now I'm second grade student home supervisor) - yes people absolutely still share cokes/tea save $2. 
My husband's ex-wife knew co-worker tested positive Friday share tid-bit anyone told get tested (on Sunday) - received positive result Tuesday. spent Saturday moving family member new apartment another town, hours away, final year college. 

WE. ARE. NOT. OK. DOWN. HERE. 

it's also August - hottest month Southerners beyond done 100¬∞ days + insane humidity. Grumpy ignorance worst. can‚Äôt believe folks legitimately expect teachers fine going back face-to-face. I‚Äôm one talking nowadays get take (which don‚Äôt much days) either nuke food fresh plate microwave leave oven least 250 heat ~30 minutes. immediately throw original packagings. mean, whole islands also big factor thought... course, people police themselves, fact theres initiative Government minimal control (as said, app, info quarantining where) makes joke. Specially seeing people behave regards masks social distancing.  ""A month here, 27 years there. What's really difference?

Republicans sure eager give away money rich &amp; corporations... states poor people... much! see september

what's classy rich trashy poor... government funds intentional right? 

You literally proving point.. 

You say mild symptoms, almost nonexistent? 

Why think don‚Äòt want tested? want tested. one spreading it, since don‚Äòt know it. No, youre dumb.

Theres nowhere near 1/4 human population dead this.

Do tell worlds statistics. far, **IN WORLD** theres 4% mortality. 400million tests, 21mil confirmed cases, 757k deaths. means, round up, 800k deaths world population 7.8 BILLION people. look first link - see effectively, world, less 100 people **per million** died. means, 1 every 10k people die. overwhelmingly majority people also 60+ specifically USA, 160k deaths came start virus, current spread.

So, lets divide - becomes .0001%. Im sure math wrong id happy hear rebuttal, then...

The UK **Not** better USA. fact, many countries much worse, per capita, USA.

So take time educate yourself, learn thing two actual #s mean. Made worse 28% (according research did) US got infected entire pandemic Spanish Flu total population 105MM time. entire 3 years.

We 1.5% currently (roughly) 6 months thing. number continues high increase, might see 50% 350MM infected time done. top that...28% 105MM 29.4MM...which rapidly approaching nearly 5.5MM confirmed already. doctors right 10X actual compared confirmed, already WELL past number total... I'm sure that's teachers would wanted, know...

Maybe sing school song, loudly possible close together possible. sounds incredibly pompous hope not. Airlines require masks now, that's good. good employer requires masks now. mine. Fire stupid motherfuckers  one make quote? ""As recently, still traced major U.S. outbreak sort outdoor exposure"".

If think as, tens millions confirmed cases traced single one outdoor spread, seems remarkable makes outdoors seem incredibly safe. Maybe even safe there's point wearing mask outdoors?

However suspect would strong conclusion. I've also heard contact tracing going poorly, wonder many separate outbreak events traced anything particular US? might pretty tiny number. case could outdoor spread still happening, major superspreader events (yet). can't nice societies wash hands touch groceries, consider dirty. consider something dirty, clean it.  Flu Bro! 1918 Flu! That's good know, realize different synthetic organic materials Toss category ‚Äúpolicies adopted three four months ago‚Äù Definitely agree. article say country ""all shuts down"" summer anyway.

Edit: article states antibody surveys show 20% population infected thus far, would presumably go moving fall winter. jail. Bend more. Yeah. almost effects global pandemic government utterly fails prepare handle devastating effects far beyond official death total. 

Unfortunately, decided spout bunch ""Blame lockdowns celebrate opening back up"" nonsense despite fact excess deaths started climb  I'm trying smear group.. I'm saying, likely following rules. seems absurd try something like bunch games right now. God damn them. anti-intellectualism, like pseudo-intellectualism. believe ""science wrong useless, must opposite"". believe truth covered majority people unaware really going on. know what's real they're trying wake everybody. Russian people get clumsy near open windows. Nothing see here. ""President Trump provided descenting viewpoint today whether smoking actually causes cancer. says research may suggest link, says he's known many people smoked entire lives without getting cancer. surgeon general American Cancer Society strongly disagree viewpoint, suggesting may unreliable.""

(Obviously real life quote. Yet.) Don‚Äôt forget crowdfunding pitch didn‚Äôt health insurance! Exactly. positive ratio matters, country cases need test more. US currently registering positive ratio 8-9%, higher recommended 5%. even positive ratio uneven. New York's positive ratio less 1%, Texas positive ratio 20%. think would benefit re-branding Covid Spreader Test something like that. tests could mass produced cheap (1$ - 2$).  price point, could used daily school kids type group setting. 15 minute test detects contagious asymptomatic ""spreaders"" real game changer. Yes get covid once. Many people drive car every single day, twice day, maybe even more, life.

Someone starts job 20 drives job 30, never using car anything else, driven car 5000+ times.

The chance die using car low. chance die using car daily entire life still twice likely kill getting covid once...

... go fucking restaurant? many fatalities health care workers UK first, since healthcare workers told supplement Vitamin any.

[It appears guidance came number COVID fatalities among healthcare workers UK increased since then*. shed light sources working with?

*The numbers sort hazy - even following two accounts contradictory, gives sort context claim.

[May 20: Boris Johnson estimates 181 NHS + 131 (total 312) Social Care Office National Statistics gives numbers 272 + 268 (total 540) early March late unprotected sex grocery? Oh lot less fun veggie isle buddy doesn‚Äôt matter much free high quality care providing, still forcing people homes go quarantine camps. Unfortunately, others also pay defiance. basically sicknesses work? get don't. Human bodies weird. better? Waiting 6 months procedure need, dying can't afford pay bill first place?

Not mention, even $40k procedure need specialists nearest hospital, dude could offer $60k skip front line leave waiting indefinitely.

That's metaphor, checks out. People show ER medicaid/ medicare often wait far longer checked Cadillac insurance plans disposable income even notice high out-of-pocket expense.

&amp;#x200B;

That's one example system intricate layers safety nets designed protect wealthy, even make massive mistakes, flip side working poor/ middle class financial landmines around every corner designed keep place one misfortune (flat tire, missing one paycheck, sick week pay, etc.) away tragedy. Death rates 10x higher Spanish scale death per 100k 1 million Frankly give shit civility rando Reddit thinks ""presentation."" Facts facts either way, better things hand hold process understanding things.

Scurry away. üëã would rather half politicians US vilify science point manufacture morons wear mask ""believe science"" whatever means.

Add pretty much repeat 1918 mistakes (since ignore history along science.) governor az saying months even clearly true. Sorry governor sucks maybe even ours. numbers finally getting better don‚Äôt even know trust I‚Äôve checking daily months dropped dramatically (we r talking thousands less day) stopped sending cdc data. Trying paranoid super abrupt yet nothing changed far closures anything doesnt match would make sense. Lol, especially Redfield‚Äôs history stance it‚Äôs crazy people think  Surfaces transmission vector. told 3 days metal/plastic, 1 day cardboard.

What surfaces products shipped ? hidden UV, suspect pathogen eventual decay rate. Could survive week UPS package ?  ethical consumption capitalism. accurate, also inaccurate.

2.	Many young parents aren‚Äôt mature enough actually deal kids, never completed transition adulthood themselves."
